1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi! I'm here!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello. We were just whinging about you being late.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh. Well, you know how it is, right? It's kinda normal.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, it's perfectly normal. That was what we were whinging about.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I gotta go tell everybody. Hold on a second.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I gotta actually let everybody know what's going on. I put out a video that said

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
come over in an hour, but I should probably just annoy everyone with a bunch of

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
everyone's. So, at everyone

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the weekly sip is live.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Give me a second here. I'll post it on Twitter too.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay. That's cool. Thank you. Appreciate it.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, how's it going?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's going fantastic. Thank you for turning up to Shitpost

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
with me for a while, Dev. Yeah, no problem.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's been a while. A year or two. It has been.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I think the last time we streamed together was

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the follow-up interview for Exploring the Politosphere, which was

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ages ago. Couple years, yeah.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Does everyone have their coffee? Wait, do you have your tea? I mean, you're a

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
BritBong, so you have to have tea. I drink neither, so

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am going to disappoint everyone with Pepsi bags.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What kind of a BritBonger doesn't drink tea?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
One who actually has taste buds, Dev. Oh, you don't

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
like tea? No, not at all.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's leaf water with milk and sugar in it.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's honestly very surprising, actually.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I don't drink coffee because I know if I start drinking it

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
on top. Listen, it's really good.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sure it is, but that's exactly...

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh god, I'm very coffee right now, and I don't mean to drink, I mean I'm coughing

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
a lot. I don't have the Coof,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
though. I've already had it twice. I had, back in April 2020,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I had Coof One, Coof Original, and then

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
in October, I had the Delta

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
variant. So, people who say that the Coof isn't real seem to be

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
retarded, but it's not that bad.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Most people are so bad at that shit. I think I got Coof Two

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Delta Boogaloo

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
a few months ago,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but it literally was just like a bad cold. Oh, did you get tested?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, but I didn't get

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
any. I got symptoms that I

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
don't normally get when I get a cold or a flu.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And like, including like shortness of breath, which

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
only really, which only really, which means it was attacking my lungs, which it doesn't

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
never happens to me when I get the flu. Right, right.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I mean, I got tested and it was confirmed, so that's

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I mean, oh god, you know,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it is sometimes hard to support those who are against

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the current establishment when they say such ridiculous things as

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
COVID doesn't exist. And it's like, come the fuck on.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How, how much tinfoil do you have to be wearing to actually believe that?

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Like you can, you can, you can, you know, wonder about vaccines, you can

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
complain about lockdowns because that's completely reasonable, but like

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
COVID doesn't exist seems to be a ridiculous position

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to hold. At least I think so.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Here's the thing. I have only just recently got my first shot because I was holding

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
out for a while to see about, you know, like long-term effects and

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
whatnot. Yeah. But then they started, basically because

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm a student and also I work in an industry

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
tangentially connected to the NHS, I was basically being pressured

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
on all angles, so I eventually just had to concede. Otherwise

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I would have likely lost my job and been stuck

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
studying at home for another, for another term.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Another five years.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I was like, you might as

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
well. And it's, so I only just recently got

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the first jab, but it's fine. Like,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't necessarily have a problem with vaccines in general.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I just, I did feel there was a bit to be said about it

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
being rushed through trials and whatnot. Yeah.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So I just, so, so I got it

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
recently and it's been fine. The worst I got was that my

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
muscle was stiff. Yeah. See for me, what ended

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
up happening was like, I was considering getting it, but I was

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
also waiting for the trials to be done. And they, they finished up like this past summer, right?

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was like, okay, they seem to be like safe enough. All right, fine. Trials are over.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Nothing's really been uncovered. Nothing too crazy. Fine. And so

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the, the plan was because I work from home

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and everybody else who lives with me in this house, they don't. The idea

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
would be that, um, I, they would just get their shots first and

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I would take care of them if something bad happened. And then once everyone else was

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
immunized, then I would get it. Um,

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
so everyone got their shots. And then when it came time for me to get mine,

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the Ontario government announced the vaccine passport.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I was just like, well, I'm not going to fucking comply with this. This is ridiculous.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So now, and honestly, now that I've had COVID, I don't really care. I've had the Delta variant.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I really don't care. Like there's natural immunity. Natural immunity is real. So

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
now I'm just like, I'm not going to lend any of my,

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
my own personal legitimacy, however little that might be

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to a vaccine passport that I fundamentally don't, don't agree with.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So now I'm just not going to get it. Fuck it.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, I can totally understand that. Political jargon for $10.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you very much. Fan of death. I don't have much to give, but here's some for a good cause.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you very much. Um, anyway. Oh, I forgot to

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I forgot to ask, what's the cause?

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Cancer Research UK. What is that? It's a, it's a, it's a charity to

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
research cures for cancer. Oh, oh, you said cancer

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
research. I think you said council research UK and I was like, what?

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, Cancer Research UK. All right. Oh, oh,

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
so, uh, have you talked about what happened at the start of your show yet?

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What do you mean? Well, I know

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Aiden was supposed to be on. She messaged me and she told me, did she tell you what's going on? Why she didn't, why she

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
she was, she was late. Yeah. Wasn't it to do with something to do with her family?

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, it was a family thing that came up. So she sends her apologies.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, that's fine. I told her, I told her

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was less annoyed that she didn't turn up and I was more annoyed the fact that this is the

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
second time in a row she hasn't turned up. But I basically

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I basically just told her that it was fine and not to, not to worry about it.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She's a really nice person, but I know that she, she gets

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
she, she has a tendency to like worry if people hate her. I've noticed.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, it's, she is a, she's a lovely lass, but she's just

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
it was, I was just, I was a little bit salty

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
at first, but then I just decided, cause fuck it. Yeah, right.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's not worth getting salty

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
about. It's a 12 hour stream and we managed to get through the first topic

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
with just the, with the guests we had, so

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
it wasn't a bother. Yeah, fair enough.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Jesus.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Maybe I've got Omicron. I'm just going to get all the COVID's.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, you, you dying? Kinda, I don't know why.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Actually, you know what it is? It's where I live.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Um, the climate, the specific climate in this like one location

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
in Canada is just dry. It's very, very dry

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
in the winter. Um, and you don't have this in the UK because it's just

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
a difference. Um, we get, we get cold

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
enough here in the winter in Canada that water can no longer evaporate.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Um, so it just freezes.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Water, so in the winter you'll have no clouds and

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the sky is always sunny and blue, but it's like

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
minus 60 degrees Celsius out and the air

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is extremely dry. So you just like, you're just

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
constantly coughing and, and Fleming because, and like everything is just dry.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Jesus, it's awful. For, for the most part here

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
it's like minus two in the middle of the night and it's like, like right now

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
it's four degrees Celsius. Yeah.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm not worried about global warming in the slightest because Jesus, it's so cold

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
here. I wouldn't mind a little bit. The thing is

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
with the UK is that where it is in terms of latitude

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it should be a lot colder than it is, but we also get because of

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
where specifically, where we sit on the planet, we get, we get

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
warm current, warm air currents from the south, which heat up the

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
country all year round. So we're like a few, like we're like

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
a good, maybe five, 10 degrees hotter than we should be.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, the, uh, the west coast of Canada gets the same thing cause of the ocean

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
warm currents. So Vancouver right now is like our

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
early summer, you know, I'm just freezing.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's like, all right, thanks.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But it's kind of interesting though, because I'm far enough north that

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
there's not much snow. It's all just ice. We have sheets

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
of ice that come down rather than snow.

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The only person, the only person who knows what I'm talking about whenever I talk

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
about this with people is Arch cause he's in Norway. They have the same thing.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Fucking, I don't get how you can live

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
like if you don't, if you went much further north, you'd be living a fucking

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, when I did live further north,

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
um, there were tunnels underneath some sidewalks

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
that allowed you to get to certain parts in the city really easily without having to expose

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
yourself to the air. And that's just how they do it when you go far north, I guess.

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's actually pretty cool. That's actually pretty cool infrastructure. I'd like to see that at some point.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Unfortunately, it was built with taxation, pal.

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Fucking, don't go there. We're not having that conversation today.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm going to kill him with laughter and then I win the argument by default.

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Is that how it works?

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm pulling from the Jeremy Corbyn book of victories.

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey, didn't he come out as based recently?

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Was he being like anti-vax or like, sorry, anti-vacuum passport?

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No, that was his brother, Pierce Corbyn. Oh, what's his deal?

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He's basically, he, do you know

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
how all the lefty revolutionary larpers like hate anyone who's actually

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
revolutionary because it reveals their larp?

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Sometimes. I have seen people like Castro though.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Basically, Pierce Corbyn is the

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
actual revolutionary to the larp revolutionary that is

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Jeremy Corbyn. Okay. So when he's out there talking

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
about like burning down the houses of MPs or something?

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, he's out there saying, we need to burn down the houses

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
of MPs. We can't put up with this anymore in response to like

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
like lot of facts, like COVID lockdowns and stuff.

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He actually got arrested today as well. For saying that?

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah. Because it's considered, I think they said

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it's considered cause to violence. Damn.

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, I guess it is technically if you think about it.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So basically he is the actual revolutionary to the

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Jeremy Corbyn's larp revolutionary. Alright.

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But he's coming at it from a left wing perspective I guess?

188
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, he's a lefty revolutionary but he's like, he's

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
slightly more acceptable than the American progressive because he's kind of an

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
old school lefty English

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
old school English lefty, like this sort of

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
George Orwell type lefty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you mean.

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So I don't know how many weekly sips you've watched over the years.

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I've done quite a bit of them, but the basic idea of the show

195
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the basic idea of the show is

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I usually shit post just talking with the chat and talking with people for

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
about half an hour. And then I do the

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I do articles and I go over a series of articles. It's usually

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
a random number from a random time period. The idea is

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
over the course of a week I will research for various video topics

201
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and I'll store them up and I'll store them away and I might not make those videos that week but I'll at least

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
store up the sources that I collect. However, when I find an article

203
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that is interesting enough to be talked about

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but does not actually fit into any kind of larger video

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I put that aside and those ones that I've collected

206
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
for the week I do on the weekly sip.

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's the process of how I do this show.

208
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right, okay. I need a method

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
of seeing the things so you can either send me them

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
or you can screen share and I'll

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
screen feed Streamlabs. I should be able to screen share with you

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
let's see how it works.

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
720, oh jeez I can't do 1080.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
God dammit. If I hit go live

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
there it is.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So there it is. Can you see that?

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hold on, I'll screen feed

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
there we are. You'll pipe it in? Yeah, now

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
they should be able to see it. Wait, why is Mitch saying

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
eww dev? Fucking, cause

221
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mitch is being a silly boy and he always

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
isn't. Isn't he the

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
guy who had the one like grossed out Pepe avatar

224
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and he had to say that he's not cringe political opinions?

225
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, that was his name for a while, not cringe political boast.

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He's a

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
good boy. I like Mitch but. Yeah, I've talked to him once.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, he does love to take the piss

229
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
so does me.

230
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Jeremy Corbyn actually voted against Boris'

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
plan B restrictions. Jesus.

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah. What a weird situation you guys are finding yourself in.

233
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The thing is, you'll find that that is not

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
a principled opposition. That is an opposition

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
based in attempts at

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
getting popular. Because

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the socialist wing of the Labour party

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
are on the defense right now because Keir Starmer

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
took over from Jeremy Corbyn and he's, I wouldn't say he's entirely a

240
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Blairite but he's more of an election.

241
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're cutting out a bit for me, geez. I was just saying

242
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
he's more of a Blair, like

243
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Keir Starmer's taken over the Labour party

244
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and he's closer to a Blairite than he is to a Momentum

245
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
guy. He's not from the socialist wing of the

246
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Labour party. Right, right. And so the socialist wing of the

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Labour party will just go against the, whatever

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the Blairites do which, and the Blairites seem to be supporting the Tories

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
from lockdown stuff. Yeah.

250
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So, I've collected my articles and here they are.

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I think you'll like this first one. Right.

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because it'll probably, it'll probably tickle that

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
ANCAP funny bone of yours. So let's read it here.

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
These parents built a school app. Then the city called the cops.

255
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh for fuck's sake.

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Like, fuck you. Let people homeschool their kids.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, no, that's not what it was. The official app was a disaster

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
so knowledgeable parents built an open source alternative.

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, I see. Oh, I like this.

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay, so.

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Christian Langren's patience was running out.

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Every day the separated father of three was wasting precious time

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
trying to get the city of Stockholm's official school system to

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
work properly. Langren would dig through endless

265
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
convoluted menus to find out what his children were doing at school. If working out

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
what his children needed in their gym kit was a hassle, then working out

267
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
how to report them as sick was a nightmare.

268
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I have done a big sip, Tidge. You missed it. Here, I'll do one for you right now. Hold on.

269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's good stuff, man. Ah, yeah. Start drinking coffee.

270
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's good for you. Okay.

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Two years after its launch in August 2018, the Skoll platform

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
had become a constant thorn in the side of thousands of parents

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
across Sweden's capital city. Commissioned

274
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
in 2013, the system was intended to make the lives of up to 500,000 children,

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
teachers, and parents in Stockholm easier, acting as the technical

276
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
backbone for all things education, from registering attendance to keeping a record of grades.

277
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The platform was a complex system made up of three different parts, containing 18

278
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
individual modules that are maintained by five external companies. The sprawling system is used by

279
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
600 preschools and 177 schools, with separate

280
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
logins for every teacher, student, and parent. The only problem

281
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
is that it doesn't work.

282
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It was a huge red flag when they said five different companies.

283
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This tells me that this is an app that's been made by

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
committee, and anything made by committee tends to be shit.

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Generally, you need a singular

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
coherent vision, and you can delegate

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
the creation of that vision to different people, but it needs to be a singular

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
vision. Video games actually have that problem quite a lot

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
as well, with a game being pulled in a thousand

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and one different direction. It ends up

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
not fulfilling any of it.

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You keep cutting out for me, man. Do you have an auto-closer on your mic?

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't think so.

294
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There's a way to set up in Discord.

295
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
User settings, voice and video, and then you'll have

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
automatically determine input sensitivity. If you turn that down

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
a bit, it might be a bit better. Hold on.

298
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Sorry, where was it again? So user settings,

299
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
then voice and video,

300
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and then it says input sensitivity,

301
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and it says automatically determine input sensitivity.

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can slide. Because what it sounds like is at the end of your

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
sentences, when your voice goes a little bit quieter, it's cutting it off.

304
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Wait, so

305
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
am I dragging it upwards or downwards?

306
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's left or right.

307
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Am I dragging it left or right? If you go left,

308
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
then that should actually lower the noise floor.

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So it shouldn't cut you off. Right, okay. Is that better?

310
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It seems like it, yes. You already haven't cut off

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
once. Right, that's decent. Fair enough.

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So to continue on, the Skoal platform

313
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
has cost more than 1 billion Swedish krona,

314
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
$117 million, and it's failed to match the initial

315
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
ambition. Parents and teachers have complained about the complexity of the system.

316
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The launch was delayed, there have been reports of project mismanagement,

317
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and it has been labeled an IT disaster.

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The Android version of the app has an average 1.2

319
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
star rating. Oof, that sounds awful.

320
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Just give me a second here. I love democracy.

321
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't, but you know.

322
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay, let me just keep reading.

323
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because this is a long article, we don't got to read all of it. I just kind of have the certain,

324
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
the certain bits. Yeah. So Lang Drin, he's a developer and the

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
CEO of a Swedish innovation consulting firm.

326
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
He has a hat, which was emblazoned with the words

327
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Skrota Skoal platform, loosely translated as trash the school platform.

328
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He joked that he should wear the hat when he picks his children up from school.

329
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Weeks later, wearing the hat, he decided to

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
take matters into his own hands. From my own frustration,

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I just decided to create my own app. Oh,

332
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
he's just going for it. He wrote to city officials asking to see Skoal

333
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
platform's API documents. While waiting for a response,

334
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
he logged into his account and tried to work out whether the system could be reverse engineered.

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
In just a few hours, he had created something that worked.

336
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I had. Absolutely.

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Absolutely based in innovation build. I had information

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
on my screen from the Skoal platform. Then I started building an API

339
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
on top of their lousy API. The work started at the end of

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
November, 2020, just days after Stockholm's board of education was hit

341
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
with a 4 million fine for serious shortcomings in the app.

342
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sweden's data regulator had found serious

343
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
flaws in the platform that exposed the data of hundreds of thousands of parents,

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
children, and teachers.

345
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
People's personal information could be accessed from Google searches.

346
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's what I'm saying. This school system just

347
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
doxxed a bunch of people. Fuck me, man.

348
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh my god. Incompetence.

349
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
In the weeks that followed, Langdren teamed up with fellow developers

350
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and parents and they hatched a plan. They would create an open source version

351
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
of the Skoal platform and release it as an app.

352
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Building on Langdren's earlier work, they opened up Chrome's developer tools,

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
logged into the Skoal platform, and wrote down all of the URLs and payloads.

354
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They took the code, which called the platform's private API and built packages so it

355
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
could run on a phone, essentially creating a layer on top of the existing

356
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
glitchy Skoal platform. The result was the

357
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Opna Skoal platform, or open school platform. It was

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
released on February 12th, 2021. All of its code is published under an open

359
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
source license on GitHub. Anyone can take and use the code

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
with very few limitations on what can be done with it, what they can do with it.

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
If the city wanted to use the code, they could. But rather than welcome it with

362
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
open arms, city officials reacted with indignation.

363
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Even before the app was released, the city government warned

364
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Langdren that it might be illegal.

365
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
How is it illegal to make an

366
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
open source app? Probably because it's using like school information

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
or something. It's just going to be

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
governments mad that a private citizen did something better. That's what the story is, basically.

369
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Well, that's what I mean. It's basically just

370
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
state mad that state got proven incompetent.

371
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So, in the eight months that followed, the city of Stockholm

372
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
attempted to derail and shut down the app. It warned parents to stop using the app

373
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and alleged that it might be illegally accessing people's personal information.

374
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Officials reported the app to data protection authorities and

375
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Langdren claims tweaked the official system's underlying code to stop

376
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the app from operating at all. Then in April, the city announced it was

377
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
getting the police involved. Officials claimed the app and its co-founders

378
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
may have committed a criminal data breach and asked cyber crime

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
investigators to look into how the app worked.

380
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The move took Langdren, who had been meeting with city officials, to address

381
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
concerns about the app by surprise.

382
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Well, this is basically just like going, this

383
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
feels very like, very by the numbers

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
state action, just don't question us.

385
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Question us and we'll, they're trying to make an example of this bloke because

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
he showed them up. Yeah. Basically like their solution sucked,

387
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
he made one that's better and they don't like that.

388
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That's all it is. So, the

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Opna Skull platform is not a complicated app.

390
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
While the official school platform is built for everyone involved in education in the Swedish

391
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
capital, its open source alternative is just for parents.

392
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The one Euro app has been downloaded around

393
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
12,500 times on iPhone and Android

394
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
with an average 4.2 star rating and it only shows basic information.

395
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Parents log in,

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
12,500 downloads for like an

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
education app, that's pretty good actually.

398
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Parents log in using the Swedish digital identity

399
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
system bank ID, that already sounds fucking awful right there.

400
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I didn't know the Swedes had that, but okay.

401
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The bank ID is also used by the Skull platform. They can then see information about

402
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
their children that's pulled into the app through the Skull platform API. The app shows

403
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
school calendars and events such as music concerts, a daily schedule for pupils,

404
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
notifications from teachers that link out to grades and news updates, food that's being served in cafeterias,

405
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and an option to report children that are sick. Everything that we

406
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
display is open and public information.

407
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
He explains that when the students grades are shown, they are displayed

408
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
through an in-app browser where the app can't access any data.

409
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So basically they built an app

410
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that took the data from the other app that was glitchy as fuck

411
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and made it actually work. And that's why they're complaining.

412
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They're complaining because they did something better. Yeah.

413
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It really, this just really gets on my last nerve

414
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
because it treats, it's treating private citizens

415
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
like they're criminals just because they

416
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
had the nerve to innovate on

417
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
like build upon what the state was doing. Not even directly go against

418
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the state, just build upon what the state had done and make it better.

419
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yep. Yep. Exactly.

420
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And doing it, and not even using

421
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
state funds either. They did it like under their own time.

422
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yep. It's fucking, like this is just

423
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
it's peak pettiness and it really gets on my libertarian hackles.

424
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I knew this would be the greatest, the great article to start with you.

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So. It just, mmm. The city of

426
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Stockholm was unsure about the official platform from the beginning.

427
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We do not have open API, so they made their own solution.

428
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It may be illegal because people's personal data is involved.

429
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And even though Helen Mossberg, who is the

430
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
deputy head of digitization and IT at the city's education division,

431
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
claimed to be generally positive about the app, she still said that

432
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
a rigorous investigation was being launched.

433
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
In mid February, a Swedish security firm completed an external audit

434
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
of the app and the report was not published.

435
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And then three weeks later at the end of February, the city said

436
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
it was making security updates to the Skoll platform to stop any potential personal

437
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
data from being accessed, effectively shutting down Apna Skoll

438
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
platform's home brewed API. This began

439
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
a tug of war between the two sides. The Skoll platform would be updated,

440
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Apna Skoll platform would respond with its own updates. In March,

441
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Apna Skoll platform was apparently updated seven times to avoid sabotage from

442
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
the city, which continued to change its underlying systems.

443
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So it doesn't sound like the city is actually fixing any of the problems with the

444
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
app. This has been going for like two years at this point, but when it comes

445
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
time to, when it comes time to stop this competitive app,

446
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
they're, they're updating it like crazy.

447
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Well, that's what I mean. They're not trying to, they're doing this

448
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
out of spite. It's painless. They're doing it. They

449
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
would rather the app be actively worse to use

450
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
as long as a private citizen wasn't the one to make it.

451
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yep. Do not pretend to tell me that the

452
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
state cares about you. In early April,

453
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
the city asked the developers to unpublish their source code from

454
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
GitHub. On April 15th, the Education Administration

455
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
announced it had completed its investigation into the parent developed system and had

456
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
concerns about how the app handled data. The city then reported the developers

457
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and Apna Skoll platform into the police, saying that it believed a

458
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
data breach had occurred. They wrote the police report

459
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
in a way that was supposed to look scary. That says, says Langdon.

460
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
In the following weeks, Cybercom investigators came to his house and interviewed him about the open source app,

461
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
a process that Langdon says caused him to doubt the work the team had done.

462
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You have to make a decision at that point on what you're trying to do. He ultimately

463
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
decided to keep working on the project along with an expanding team as they believed it was

464
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the right thing to do. As the dispute was unfolding,

465
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Apna Skoll platform continued growing in popularity,

466
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
including a swell the number of people involved in its development. So now

467
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
they have 40 people working on this app because it's so popular and apparently it's at least

468
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
it's at least kind of financially solvent, probably not for all 40 of them, but

469
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
people want this basically. The volunteers have

470
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
found and squashed bugs, developed a search feature, and

471
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
translated the app into different languages. They also raised

472
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
potential security issues with the official app, even as the city worked against them.

473
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
All right.

474
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I know you're trying to sue us, I know you're trying to sue us out of

475
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
existence and possibly get me arrested, but here's why your app is shit.

476
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yep. So it seems like

477
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
in the end, they won

478
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
because Apna Skoll platformer had to wait months to be cleared.

479
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We do not believe anything criminal has been committed,

480
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
said the leader of the police's preliminary investigation, and the

481
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
data regulator in Sweden did not open an investigation into the city's complaint.

482
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So it seems like the city lost this one, at least so far.

483
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Based.

484
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
However,

485
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
things changed in September. Langdon was traveling to his brother's

486
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
wedding in France when he got a phone call. The city was changing

487
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
actually, no, no, this is when it got better. The city was changing its position on

488
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Apna Skoll platform and any other app seeking to do similar things and decided to let

489
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
others access the data within its systems. To do so, the city struck

490
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
a deal with an external provider that will be able to set up licenses between

491
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Apna Skoll platform and the city. So now the city

492
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
can guarantee that private data is handled in a correct and secure way while

493
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
parents can take part in the market's digital tools in their everyday lives.

494
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
See, I have a feeling that governments would just generally be better

495
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
off if they allow this kind of economic activity to happen

496
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and just be like, listen, you can just pay us a cut and we won't fucking bother you.

497
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Better than like fighting their own populace, you know what I mean?

498
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Well yeah, basically if they

499
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
allow the populace to get involved in the streamlining of state activity

500
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
not only will it save them time, it will save them money

501
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and it will avoid a lot of the

502
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
complications that come with government bureaucracy and inefficiency.

503
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Like, here's the thing, I am a pragmatist, I might

504
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
be an anarcho-capitalist, but if a state is going to exist, I want that state

505
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
to be as streamlined and efficient and cost-effective as possible.

506
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So, I think this is ultimately

507
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
like, as an achievable political goal, this is probably an incredibly

508
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
good thing. It's something that should be emulated elsewhere.

509
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I mean, at the end of the article Langren says that all

510
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
officials should make their APIs open source so citizens can build technology

511
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
that works for them. If you build the API, the app will come. And

512
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I can understand the security complaint. That's reasonable. You don't want

513
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
people getting a hold of your child's schedule or something. Yeah, fair enough.

514
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I also understand the other side of it too, you know?

515
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
There's a reasonable conversation to have here that isn't just

516
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
shut it down. To be fair, the original

517
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
state-built one was doxxing people so

518
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
they don't really have a leg to stand on on security. That's true. They were

519
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
also failing at it. But just because they were failing at it, that doesn't mean that it's also not a legitimate

520
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
question to ask. You know what I mean?

521
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, I suppose. But I'm just saying that

522
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
being a part of the state apparatus does not

523
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
exempt you from... That kind of incompetence? Yes.

524
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Not just that incompetence, but also from being a

525
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
security threat yourself. Right, right. So that's pretty much the end of that

526
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
story. I knew you would enjoy that one. I did,

527
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
so thank you very much. Okay, what's the next one? Oh!

528
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, you guys are going to love this! You guys are going to love this.

529
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Do you remember Thirsty Sword Lesbians?

530
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't, but elaborate, please.

531
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I covered it on the show a couple months ago. It was a tabletop RPG

532
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
rule set that was only for

533
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
lesbians. If you weren't a lesbian, you couldn't play.

534
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And of course they have all the things like, fascists can't play this game. You know what I mean, right?

535
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You know what I'm talking about. You know the kind of thing I'm talking about.

536
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Woke tabletop. Yes.

537
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So, they have announced their

538
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Woke First expansion. They're now

539
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
kickstarting Advanced Lovers and Lesbians.

540
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Draw your sword and bare your heart with new character types, fresh

541
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
settings, and even more ways to enjoy Thirsty

542
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Sword Lesbians. This Kickstarter received $97,000.

543
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How? How? How? Why?

544
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Why does this exist? Oh, it makes

545
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
me angry just looking at it. No, cause look,

546
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
why would people waste a hundred grand on something like this?

547
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like...

548
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Look. Okay, let me read it. Let me read it.

549
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Draw your sword and bare your heart with this new print supplement for

550
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Thirsty Sword Lesbians. Ten new character playbooks, four adventures, twenty

551
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
plus settings, and a toolbox full of inspirational mechanics that will take

552
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
your game to the next level. And Advanced Lovers and Lesbians.

553
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Wow. Dude, do you see this image?

554
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Can I make it bigger? Hold on.

555
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's gross.

556
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That's legitimately gross.

557
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Looking at it, some of it's

558
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
fine. The art isn't bad, but freaking

559
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I don't know. A lot of the characters just seem to be drawn

560
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
to be so deliberately off-putting.

561
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't know what it is. Well, it's made by the company Gay Spaceship

562
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Games, and if I zoom in enough, can you see this?

563
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Right there. Actually, hold on. I'll need to pull up.

564
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Just give me a second.

565
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Okay. So, the original Thirsty

566
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Sword Lesbians had official artwork

567
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
of this. And there it is.

568
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And yeah, the characters are pretty ugly. However,

569
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
what's interesting is that they are clearly

570
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and obviously aping the design of a

571
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
reasonably obscure 1990s anime

572
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
called Revolutionary Girl Utena. And I'll show you what I mean.

573
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Nobody fucking watches Revolutionary Girl Utena anymore. That was like

574
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
made in 96. That's what I'm saying. I've heard of Utena.

575
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Right. So, here's Utena.

576
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Hold on. Can I get a better picture than that? Come on, internet.

577
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay. Here's Utena.

578
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It's clearly the same kind of design, but the characters are significantly more

579
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
appealing. I'm not seeing it, bud. I think you're gonna need to zoom.

580
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
No. Are you sure? Yeah, I think you need to

581
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
zoom out, bud. Zoom out? This is... Okay, hold on.

582
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That's just... Yeah. What do you mean? I'm not seeing

583
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
this picture of Revolutionary Girl Utena. Oh, you're not?

584
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I wonder why. Hold on.

585
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Why isn't it... No, it's not giving you the...

586
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's only... I think it's only showing one window. Okay, hold on.

587
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
If I did this... Yeah, that's good. Okay, so this is

588
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
the Thirsty Sword Lesbians box art, okay?

589
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Right. And this is the Utena art.

590
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, I see. That actually looks good

591
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and appealing. And the thing is, by today's

592
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
standards, Utena is a reasonably left-leaning anime.

593
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Like, it wears its feminism on its sleeve. Like, if

594
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
you wanted to point out what is a feminist anime, it would be this show.

595
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
For sure. However... However, it's still

596
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
actually very good because the characters are well developed and there's like an actual full story arc and they go

597
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
through troubles. The main hero loses fights and has to come back. Like, it's

598
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
not just all Mary Sue bullshit. It's... You can have

599
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
good feminist or even socialist or any

600
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
brand of left-leaning storytelling. You can still have that

601
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but I think there's a reason we haven't seen it in about 20 years.

602
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Well, let's take something like...

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Let's take something a lot more Western and live-action like Law & Order, for example.

604
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If you listen to any political discussion on the show, Law & Order,

605
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
the side that always wins out is

606
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
always left-leaning. It's always the

607
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
sort of bog-standard Democrat position because

608
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
it's set in New York.

609
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But the show is still good in spite of

610
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
that because it's well-written.

611
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It just seems to be rare nowadays to have things that are well-written.

612
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It doesn't exist anymore.

613
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
In any case... I think

614
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
all the creative talent of the 21st century was just

615
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
poured into the Lord of the Rings movies and now we're having to say it through

616
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
a 100-year darkness of no talent just

617
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
because it was all went into those movies.

618
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Are you eating something? I kind of hear. Are you chowing down?

619
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Not really. Oh, are you drinking? Do you have a slurp for us?

620
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah, I'm chugging.

621
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Okay, that's what it is.

622
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This is coming out if you're interested.

623
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I keep bothering Arch and Sargon to say, listen, we have to play a game

624
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
of Thirsty Sword Lesbians. We have to play a game of this shit.

625
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It would be fucking hilarious. See, here's the thing though. Arch would

626
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
probably go for it. Sargon, I know he's busy these days, but I think

627
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
if Sargon got a spare five minutes, I'm sure he'd be down for it.

628
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Actually, Arch is the one who said no, he did not want to play

629
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Thirsty Sword Lesbians.

630
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Well, to be fair, he's very serious about his tabletop.

631
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Right, right. Okay, let's go on to the next thing I've got here.

632
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Andrew Garfield talks Spiderman.

633
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Money is the thing that has corrupted all of us and led to the terrible

634
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ecological collapse that we are all about to die under.

635
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Shut the fuck up, Spiderman. How is this about Spiderman?

636
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Like,

637
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I didn't realize Spiderman was a socialist.

638
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
An eco-socialist at that.

639
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I just don't understand. He's asked about

640
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
his newest, because he's in the newest Spiderman movie.

641
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Hey, Mr. Andrew Garfield, how do you feel about your new Spiderman movie?

642
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And this is what he gives us as an answer. What the fuck?

643
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
They almost feel like automatons at this point.

644
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
No matter what question you give them, it has to relate to

645
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
to woke talking points.

646
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And to the point where it's so ingrained in their head that they just can't deviate from it anymore.

647
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't know.

648
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I almost feel sorry for them for how NPC they have become.

649
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Let's see what he actually said. Oh, this is why he spoke to the

650
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Guardian. Okay. So speaking to the Guardian, Andrew Garfield briefly

651
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
touched upon his time playing Peter Parker

652
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
in Sony's second cinematic take on the Marvel character for The Amazing Spider-Man

653
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
and its sequel. Relieved to not have to dance around being asked whether or not he'd be back for the

654
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
third reboot at the studio, Garfield seemingly relished in the frank honesty

655
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
of what it was like to be catapulted into a character as monumental

656
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
as Peter Parker.

657
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There were millions of dollars at stake and that's what guides the ship. It was a big awakening

658
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and it hurt.

659
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So he's whinging about that movies cost money

660
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and they are expected to do well. And that he got

661
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
paid.

662
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Grow the fuck up you man child. He says

663
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Comic-Con in San Diego is full of grown men and women still

664
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
in touch with that pure thing the character meant to them. But you add

665
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
in market forces and test groups and suddenly the focus is less

666
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
on the soul of it and more on ensuring we make as much money as possible.

667
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And I find that heartbreaking

668
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
in all matters of culture. Money is the thing that has corrupted all of us

669
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and led to the terrible ecological collapse that we are all about to die

670
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
under. It's like holy fuck. Dude, I think you'll be fine living in Hollywood.

671
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Actually no, that's probably going to go underwater. But you'll have enough money to leave. Don't worry about it.

672
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
This almost sounds like, I don't know

673
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
it almost sounds like he's a child who

674
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
watched Spider-Man, thought Spider-Man was real but then

675
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
went to watch the movie being filmed and realised it's all fake.

676
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yes. Now he has a point. There's definitely

677
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
been a trend of just soulless cash-ins

678
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
on behalf of Disney and Marvel and Star Wars.

679
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You know, there's been some really shitty movies that are clearly just there

680
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
to swindle fans and run away. That happens.

681
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Don't get me wrong, those exist and in fact a large

682
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
proportion of the comic-skate

683
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
or whatever is whinging. I say whinging. That's being a bit unfair.

684
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But it's complaining about that.

685
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah, but he then links it to the terrible ecological

686
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
collapse that we're all about to die under.

687
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Man. Okay Lefty Doomer.

688
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah, like, again, just like the vaccine

689
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
conversation earlier. I'm not going to be one of those people who is like climate change doesn't exist.

690
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It does exist. But like, I think it'll be fine, dude.

691
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You know, I think human ingenuity will

692
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
invent some cool new thing that will solve whatever problems that we have

693
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and it'll be okay. We are not going to, like, the planet's

694
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
not going to turn into a bowl of molten lava. It'll be okay, guys.

695
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Like, stop thinking like you're going to be living in fucking fallout.

696
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's fine. We're not going down that road.

697
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
The two big problems with climate change are cutting down trees

698
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and plastic in the ocean. Those are the two big ones. Yes.

699
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Now, plastic in the ocean is already being solved

700
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
by market forces as we speak. There are already been technologies

701
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
developed to eat, like, micro technologies being developed to eat plastic.

702
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And second of all,

703
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
the trees, we've had methods of sustainable

704
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
tree growth since the Roman Empire.

705
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Like, this isn't new information.

706
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's not some big revelation on how to cut

707
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
down trees without killing them. The problem

708
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
is that China and Russia, and to a lesser extent India, don't care.

709
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And when you have those three, like, America and Canada and the UK

710
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
and Europe can do whatever it wants, but if you have

711
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
those guys not giving a shit, you're not going to solve the problem. You can't point

712
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
the fingers at us.

713
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Well, ultimately, India

714
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I think it's just a case of they're still in their industrialization phase.

715
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So, they will come round over time.

716
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Russia will need a regime change, but I think that's something that will occur naturally

717
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
because they're not a totalitarian regime.

718
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
They're more of an oligarchy. Authoritarian, certainly, but not totalitarian.

719
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And China

720
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't think China will last the next 50 years.

721
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah, China will destroy itself at this rate. Everyone's like, China, you gotta confront China. Well, yeah,

722
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
we do gotta confront China, but also, China's already on a downhill path

723
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
of its own making, you know?

724
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Whenever someone says, oh, a country's gonna take over

725
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
America as the next big,

726
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
the next number one economy, there always seems to be

727
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
some underlying thing that people are ignoring.

728
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Like, with Japan, it was the fact that

729
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Japan, it was the fact that

730
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
in order to fuel their economic prosperity in the 80s, they were taking on huge

731
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
amounts of death.

732
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And in China, it's the fact that their entire

733
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
economy is based on being the factory of the world, and if that

734
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
gets taken away, they'll just collapse under their own weight.

735
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Right.

736
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I guess it's time to go onto the next article, because I don't think there's anything more worthwhile than this.

737
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's long, and it's really fucking stupid.

738
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So it's just him whinging? Okay, fair enough.

739
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I forget what this one is. What is this? Oh, yeah. Check this out.

740
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
This is on a subreddit about trans pets.

741
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Okay. My male dog doesn't

742
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
lift his leg to pee. Is he trans?

743
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
My dog has already hit the two years of age mark and still pee is like a

744
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
female or a pup. Should I make an appointment with a trans-friendly

745
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
vet for gender reassignment?

746
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Right. Let me make one

747
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
thing abundantly clear.

748
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You cannot have a trans dog.

749
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Trans is a very specific, being trans

750
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
is caused by a very specific mental state that is exclusive, as far as we know,

751
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
to humans.

752
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Hold on. You cannot have a trans dog.

753
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Okay, you're gonna like this one. Yeah, this is r slash

754
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
trans pets. Oh, just kill me. Kill me.

755
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
How to stop my cat from being aggressive while

756
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
dilating. So my cat

757
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Julie had her gender reassignment surgery three

758
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
days ago. The surgeon said that her neo-vagina

759
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
needs to be dilated three times a day, ten minutes each.

760
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But she isn't liking it. How can I help her? My

761
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
hands are full of wounds because of her claws and teeth. I wanted to get

762
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
her declawed, but claws or nails are an essential part of

763
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
being a woman or a female cat. So

764
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So you've cut a male cat's bollocks off

765
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
and now you're pouring fucking fluids onto its wound

766
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and you're expecting it not to hurt?

767
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's not just that. The surgeon built a cat

768
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
neo-vagina that needs to be dilated with like

769
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
what do they use? It's kind of like a

770
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
it's like a rod that holds the wound open.

771
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, I know, but what I'm saying is that something tells me

772
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
that this is not a veterinarian's association

773
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
approved. Probably not. So it's very

774
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
likely that that wound really fucking hurts for that cat.

775
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yes. I'm hoping this is like a troll sub.

776
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Like holy fuck. No, I see, I

777
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
really hope as well because as funny as it is, at the same time

778
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
this boils my piss because I really hate, like

779
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
needless to say I hate animal abuse, but I really hate animal abuse.

780
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

781
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Okay, this one. Alright.

782
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Are you guys ready for the latest TikTok dance?

783
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You're not going to be able to hear it, okay?

784
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So I'll post it in the chat.

785
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Here it is. And you can pull it up yourself.

786
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And then on three we'll play it, okay?

787
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Okay. One, two, three.

788
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm dreaming

789
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
of a mass Christmas

790
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Pick that shit up over your nose

791
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
You can't even sing!

792
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Where the anti-masker is all set And there's

793
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
a political division

794
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
To get our Covid count so low

795
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Oh to know

796
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I'm dreaming of a mass Christmas

797
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Pick that shit up over your nose

798
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I'm dreaming of a mass Christmas

799
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Don't wanna see no chin diapers in here

800
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Seriously, on the mouth and the nose. Or get out!

801
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Come on! It's not that hard.

802
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That's it.

803
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh god. I would like to say a couple of things.

804
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Oh okay. Sorry.

805
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Which is good because it wouldn't play on my end.

806
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Second of all, that's ruined

807
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
my day. Thank you.

808
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I love Christmas and that has

809
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
thoroughly corrupted the image of Christmas.

810
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I am proud to say I have only worn a mask

811
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
once and I found it reasonable when I did because I was going into a hospital.

812
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And it's like okay yeah fair enough you know. Honestly we probably should have been doing that before

813
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
the pandemic anyway. It's a hospital. It's a different situation. But I don't

814
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
wear them to go to stores or anything. I certainly don't wear them just walking inside my house.

815
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Fuck that. Fuck all the Covid theatre.

816
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Fuck it. I have never.

817
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Right. It is a legal requirement in our country to wear them on the bus.

818
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Which is only recent. That only came in a couple of weeks ago.

819
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It is

820
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
technically legal to wear it. It is technically.

821
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
You do technically have to wear it in certain venues but nobody enforces it.

822
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Because people are sick to death.

823
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And

824
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I only wear it at work because it's a legal part

825
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
of my requirement at work because I work

826
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
in an industry tangentially related to the NHS.

827
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
See here it kind of exists in a grey area

828
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
because it makes sense to me that if a store owner wants you

829
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
to wear a mask in their shop they can tell you to leave if you don't. It's their property. It's their right.

830
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's their business. It's their house. You got to do what they say. Fair enough.

831
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
But like the government will not arrest

832
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
you if you don't wear a mask in a store. But they

833
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
sometimes find the store for not telling you to do so.

834
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But the store is not empowered to make you do so.

835
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It's like no one wants to actually be holding the potato.

836
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
The hot potato responsibility on this. So they've left it as

837
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
vague as possible. You know what I mean?

838
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Mitch for $2.65. Thank you very much.

839
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Physically remove those mask speakers and animal

840
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
trunes so to speak.

841
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Hopper posting in my

842
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
fucking chat.

843
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
We're not going to read these articles but I just wanted to go over the juxtaposition here.

844
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They're both from the same thing. They're both from Yahoo. You got

845
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Joe Rogan who's not a doctor gives terrible vaccine

846
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
advice. There's the headline.

847
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Oops I accidentally clicked off of it like an idiot. Okay. Joe Rogan who's not

848
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
a doctor gives terrible vaccine advice. Podcaster Joe Rogan who has no public health

849
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
expertise told his listeners that

850
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
healthy young adults have no need to get a vaccine.

851
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
That's probably kind of true. However, the headline

852
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and the way that they're framing this is like

853
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
they had to put in who's not a doctor. Okay. So also from Yahoo

854
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
you have five things Bill Gates wants you to

855
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
know about COVID-19 variants. Couldn't you say

856
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
five things Bill Gates who's not a doctor? Like there's

857
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
obvious bias here. Here's the thing.

858
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Joe Rogan is a podcaster. Bill Gates is their lord and master.

859
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
He is one of the

860
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
leaders in what the certain right British right wing

861
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
YouTube circles would call the managerial elite.

862
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yes. So have you seen that picture of Bill Gates drinking shit water?

863
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
No. Okay. So a few years ago

864
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Bill Gates was heavily promoting a machine that turned shit into

865
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
drinkable water and the water looked completely fine.

866
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It was probably like when it comes down to the actual molecules involved, it probably was

867
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
just regular water, but he takes it and he takes a big swig of it and he's like, that's delicious.

868
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And it's like, holy fuck dude.

869
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
It's like at best it's water. It's not delicious. It's just

870
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
water. Yes. At worst, at worst you're actively trying

871
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
to deceive people into drinking shit tasting water.

872
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yep. Okay. What is this?

873
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Oh God, this is from UndeadScribe. What did Poe send me

874
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
today? Oh yeah, this. Okay. This is a

875
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
trans person who's Japanese. Does anyone want my own

876
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
egg wine? It's about 100 milliliters.

877
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Only wine, but not the eggs. Okay. This person cut off

878
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
their own testicles and then fermented

879
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
those testicles and made wine out of it.

880
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Oh.

881
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Look, I'm all for trans

882
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
rights, right? Oh, I know. I know how much you're into them, buddy.

883
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm all for trans rights, but at the same time, can some

884
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
of you just stop being such fucking degenerates, please?

885
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Like, can you just, like, I feel like the mother

886
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
in the car in the Babadook. Just, why can't you just be

887
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
normal?

888
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Oh God, like you got like women who like cook with their period

889
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
blood or they like, they make like vagina yeast bread

890
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
or whatever the fuck. It all like, why the fuck are people doing this?

891
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Why? Because they're not okay.

892
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Like gender dysphoria is the least of their worries.

893
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Man, and you know what, like this is not

894
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
a phenomenon. It's like, it's not exclusive

895
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
to these types of people. Now we've seen a lot of it from these types of people in the past,

896
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
in the past decade or so, but I recall when I was growing up hearing

897
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
about, and this is out of more traditional communities, about

898
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
women who would eat placentas and I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

899
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Who? Why? Who the fuck wants to eat a childbirth placenta?

900
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And it's like, well, it's just, it's like a natural thing, dude. It's like, shut the fuck up.

901
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I don't want to, I don't want to do any of this.

902
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It all just sounds awful.

903
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Oh, hold on a second. I think my headphones just died. Uh oh.

904
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Hey, are you still there?

905
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah, I'm still here.

906
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Okay, they came back. I can hear you. Great. Alright.

907
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
When recycling goes wrong. Oh, okay. Hold on.

908
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
In the chat, Millie, the weekly sip is a lot better without the Minecraft server BS.

909
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I advertise the server at the start of the sip for like 30 seconds.

910
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Does that bother you that much? Alright.

911
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Okay. Minecraften. Yes.

912
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Only surveillance can save us from the coronavirus.

913
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You must have seen this, this headline around, right?

914
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Big data. Oh, yes.

915
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Look, here's, here's all I'm going to say.

916
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Anyone who supports this, if the revolution

917
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
does end up happening, if the boogaloo comes along,

918
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I will not mourn your death.

919
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Okay, so.

920
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Only surveillance can save us from coronavirus. Big data

921
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
offers tools to stop the pandemic right now if we change our definition

922
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
of privacy. Look at this, look at this

923
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
fucking guy's phone. What is this, 16 different

924
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
COVID apps? One of them is called coronavirus sus.

925
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Fuck. Okay. In those parts of the world

926
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
under lockdown, people have discovered a renewed appreciation for the internet

927
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and the resources it offers. Books, movies, music, endless

928
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
news content, and the tools to communicate with friends and family.

929
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Imagine the lockdown without the internet. It's not a comforting thought, but that would just be like

930
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
renting games from, you know, the local Blockbuster or whatever and just

931
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
staying inside. So.

932
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
To be honest, that's, that's, that's making me a tad nostalgic. I could go for that right now.

933
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah. Fucking. Yeah. Fucking get, get some

934
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
pizza, some ice cream, play some GameCube or something.

935
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh, it takes me back. To be fair, it was N64 for me. I'm a little

936
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
bit older. N64 was my big rental time.

937
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
My, um, I rented a lot when I was young because by the time I got to my teenage

938
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
years, Blockbuster had largely died out. Yep. But

939
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
it was GameCube for me because again, I was a bit younger

940
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
than when you rented, but also I didn't really have a choice

941
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
because renting would largely died out by the early 2010s.

942
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
This is a shame, man, because now, now you just got to pay like

943
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
fucking $90 in Canadian money to get a new game. Fuck.

944
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Here's the thing. It's also the fact that

945
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
like, not to get us too far off topic, but also like

946
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
it's the fact that it's largely been replaced by stuff like Xbox Game Pass

947
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
and yeah, Game Pass is, Game Pass is worth it on the face of it

948
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
but also at the same time it's like renting

949
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
like renting was good because it was specific. You could go

950
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
and rent the specific game that you wanted. You weren't just

951
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
getting like, paying a monthly fee to like get like a

952
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
different selection of games filtered in and out every month. Yep.

953
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It's a possibility that none of them interest you.

954
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Yeah, when I was growing up it was $3 a night.

955
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So you get a game, you have it for a full 24 hour period. Cost 3 bucks.

956
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
6 bucks if you go for the whole weekend.

957
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Stay up all night, eat some sweets, eat some pizza,

958
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
complete the game overnight, take it back the next day.

959
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Yep. Yep. Alright, so

960
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
let's go through here.

961
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
The internet's system of surveillance has been perfected beyond

962
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
our imaginations and usually beyond our acknowledgement. It now extends

963
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
over email, social media, credit card payments, cell phone use, and

964
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
travel records. Every flight and hotel booking, every payment and bank

965
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
transfer, every call, every picture can be brought together in a single

966
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
platform and mined for interesting or unusual patterns.

967
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Yet, while extending in every direction and the system was completely

968
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
powerless to warn us about the coronavirus, let's fight it. That is about to change

969
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and our concept of personal privacy will have to change with it.

970
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
That sounds fucking awful and fuck you.

971
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
No, it's not happening. I will

972
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
throw away my phone and I will

973
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
throw away my phone and I will give up technology before I allow

974
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the state to track me using my

975
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
devices. I will go offline before

976
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
that happens. I have a Galaxy S2.

977
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Any of you remember that phone? The Galaxy S2?

978
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
What is it? 2010? Yeah.

979
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And the reason I haven't just mindlessly updated is because

980
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
it still works. I don't use data or anything

981
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
when I'm out. Here's what I use my phone for. I occasionally call my parents

982
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
and I occasionally text some people and that's it. I never use data.

983
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I never really use its other features. Oh yeah, I have like

984
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
an exercise app on it that I only occasionally use because I'm fat. But the point is

985
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I don't need a super powerful phone.

986
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And also, I'm not even sure if my phone would work with a coronavirus

987
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
scanning app that's currently being enforced in Ontario.

988
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So, like, my

989
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Facebook, I have one picture on my Facebook because they require

990
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
you to have an avatar. And the picture is of Dr. Robotnik's

991
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
face. And it's been the same picture since 2008.

992
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Like, I work on the internet.

993
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I have the YouTube channel and I stream on Twitch and all this stuff.

994
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
But when it comes to me personally, I live a very low tech life.

995
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And I kind of prefer it that way. I kind of prefer it that way.

996
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Short-Fighter Taku is very tech-savvy, but

997
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Devin, he's not

998
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
He is a good,

999
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Mormon boy. Not Mormon, Amish boy.

1000
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
He's a good Amish boy.

1001
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
He is a good Amish boy and he does no wrong. It's funny because

1002
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
like, I'd say most of the time I go out

1003
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
of the house without my phone. Like, if I want to listen to music, sometimes I'll bring it. But I also

1004
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
have like an old MP3 player from like 2006. It still works. So it's like, whatever. I don't care.

1005
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But the point being is that

1006
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
my parents who are boomers, they're, they're older than me.

1007
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
They, they chastise me every time I

1008
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
leave the house without my phone, because sometimes they'll call me. I'm not there. Like, where were you?

1009
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Oh, I didn't have my phone when I went out. Like, why don't you have your phone with you when you go out? And it's like, well

1010
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
fucking, you spent most of your life without doing that shit.

1011
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Why does it matter now?

1012
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I never needed it. Yes. I hardly ever need it. Like fucking leave me alone.

1013
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yeah. And I, I, I like

1014
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
the occasional feeling of, because I live like 10 minutes away from a forest,

1015
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I like the occasional feeling of just going into the woods and being disconnected from everybody else

1016
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and just kind of having an hour or two to myself, you know,

1017
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Naomi and I will go for a walk, you know, it just no, no,

1018
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
no connections. You don't need to be connected or jacked in all the fucking time.

1019
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Oh, I know that feeling. I grew up in an area of the

1020
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
South of England called the New Forest in Hampshire and

1021
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
literally having the forest on your doorstep, it's such a blessing.

1022
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It really is. People don't understand how big and how wild Canada

1023
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
truly is. Like there is, unless you're in like

1024
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Vancouver or Halifax or Montreal or Toronto or Ottawa,

1025
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
if you're anywhere else or Calgary. Yeah. If you're anywhere else

1026
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
you are an hour's worth of forest

1027
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
away from anything else outside of your town. It is, this is a

1028
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
wild, isolated country. There's just tons of mountains, tons

1029
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
of forests, tons of rivers and lakes. Like there is no,

1030
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
there is no, most Canadians live in a

1031
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
place where they can just go off the grid in about 15 minutes. It's quite nice.

1032
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Before, um, before the 20th

1033
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
century fricking Canada was basically just IRL Skyrim.

1034
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Yeah, pretty much. There's like nobody fucking here, man. Like,

1035
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
okay. People talk about native civilizations and, you know, they

1036
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
weren't as primitive as people said, especially if you get down to like Central America, they

1037
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
had like empires and they had feudal systems and stuff. So it's okay. Fair enough. But like

1038
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
the natives that lived here before Europeans showed up, they

1039
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
like they, they, they only barely existed

1040
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
because it was so fucking hard to live here. It was so cold.

1041
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So even, even now that that's reflected, like if you're

1042
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
outside of a big city, like there, there's, there's some truly

1043
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
off the grid areas here. It's, it's, it's actually nice. It's quite nice.

1044
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Indeed. So yeah, we can move on

1045
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
because like this is just a bunch of stuff. Oh, oh, we want

1046
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
to pay for your bullshit. Fuck you. Right. Before we do that,

1047
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I'm going to read some super chats. Oh, okay. Um, because

1048
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
because we've got quite a few while we're talking. Oh shit. I don't

1049
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
want, I don't want people to feel neglected.

1050
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Um, uh, $1 from Mitch, just saying trune

1051
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and

1052
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and Mr. Personality for $14.88. Don't think

1053
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I don't know what you're doing when you write that. Um, cannibalism

1054
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
with extra steps. I'm not sure what that's in context

1055
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
too, but okay. Neither do I. What did we talk about

1056
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
previously? Oh, the, uh, the testicle wine.

1057
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Oh, right. Okay. Yeah. Pretty much. Listen, listen, would you drink

1058
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
the testicle wine? Um, how much

1059
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
would you be willing to pay me to do it? What if it was from a hot trap?

1060
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Still, how much would you pay?

1061
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
The hotness, the hotness of the trap is irrelevant.

1062
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It's still bollocks in it. It's still fermented bollocks.

1063
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Oh, wait, hold on. Does, does bollocks mean

1064
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
mean balls? Yeah. Oh, I always thought it meant

1065
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
thought it meant ass cheeks. No, it's why you get, it's getting kicked

1066
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
in the bollocks. It means getting kicked in the balls. Oh, okay. No, no.

1067
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
See, I don't really know British slang. I always thought it meant your butt. No,

1068
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
it's, it's, it's your, it's your balls. Oh, okay. All right.

1069
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's like the, how hot the trap is, is

1070
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
immaterial to the fact that it's still fermented bollocks.

1071
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Right. Shall we move on? There's a guy in the chat who said he's

1072
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
from Thunder Bay. I went, I went to school in Thunder Bay. I went to university there.

1073
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
What a, what a fucking isolated, oh my

1074
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
God, what an isolated shithole Thunder Bay is. Okay. Thunder Bay

1075
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
is a reasonably big city and it's surrounded by like six

1076
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
hours of forest in all directions. There's nothing there.

1077
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's just wild wilderness. It's man. And also

1078
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Is this why, is this why when you and your friend, when you and Dave, I was about to say

1079
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
your friend, I don't know his name.

1080
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Is this why you and Dave, whenever you talk about your hometown,

1081
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
you talk about it like it's like some middle, like some like

1082
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
middle America buttfuck nowhere town because it actually is. It actually

1083
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
is. Yes. And also, unfortunately, it's been overrun by

1084
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
heroin since we moved away. It is not the idyllic place it was when we grew up.

1085
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It's a shame.

1086
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Is that because of like deindustrialization?

1087
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Actually, no, because the towns, it's one of those single industry

1088
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
towns, but that industry hasn't died. It's forestry. Like there's no mines to be shut down.

1089
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
There's no factories to be shut down. It's a paper mill.

1090
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And so that, it's been going now and it's probably going to keep going for a long time

1091
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
because Canada has tons of trees. But no, it's just

1092
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
that like a lot of people who

1093
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
couldn't leave and couldn't get jobs at the mill because it's really the only place

1094
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
you can work in the town, they just ended up getting on drugs because they couldn't, they didn't

1095
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
have anything else.

1096
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Is it a case of like

1097
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
a scarcity of like jobs in the town? Yes, yeah.

1098
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
All right. Yeah. And yeah, you can walk out into the forest in the summer

1099
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
and just find random junkies living in the woods.

1100
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Oh. Yes, I went to Lakehead University. I went to Lakehead University.

1101
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I got, you know what? I got my minor in gender studies

1102
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
at Lakehead University. Yeah, you've mentioned that on the stream

1103
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
before. That's how I know about a lot of this shit. I still have

1104
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
my old textbooks. Okay, so I have like 40

1105
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
minutes, right? We should probably get through these articles. Yeah. All right, what's this?

1106
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Blaine police investigating after Instacart

1107
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
shopper allegedly drives over an elderly couple's groceries.

1108
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Jesus.

1109
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Why would you do that?

1110
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Why would you drive over, like if you, if you work for Instacart and you buy an elderly

1111
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
couple's groceries, why would you drive over it after, let's

1112
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
see. An Instacart shopper drove over their groceries last week

1113
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
possibly in response to a pro law enforcement sign

1114
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
in their front yard. Oh, so they had like a

1115
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
like a blue lives matter, like a thin blue line kind of sign in their front yard. So this person

1116
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
delivers their groceries and destroys them. Wow. Okay.

1117
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah.

1118
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It's just like, oh yeah, that's totally a way, like it's not

1119
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
even necessarily, it's not even necessarily about conducting yourself or having a

1120
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
anti-cop opinion that winds me up. It's just like, this is only going to be detrimental

1121
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
to you in the long run. Like yeah, you destroyed their groceries so they can buy you.

1122
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
They can buy you more. Is it worth really losing your job over?

1123
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Yeah, so according to a news

1124
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
release, the couple had placed an order for delivery on the morning of December 6th.

1125
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Once the driver arrived at their home,

1126
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
the couple went outside to meet the driver. The driver yelled from the check the inside of

1127
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
their Christmas wreath where they found a receipt with a derogatory message written on it.

1128
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It says that Instacart doesn't pay their employees, find another

1129
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
slave, fuck the police, racist pigs,

1130
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and the groceries themselves were destroyed

1131
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and left in the driveway. Oh my god.

1132
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Wow. Wait, so this wasn't even because

1133
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
of them? No, it was, it's just that

1134
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
this person who works for Instacart just didn't care.

1135
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
They feel like they're not getting paid enough and they saw the

1136
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
thin blue line sign in their front yard, so they destroyed the groceries

1137
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
and wrote on their Christmas wreath. And they wrote

1138
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
find another slave, fuck the police, racist pigs, and it's like Jesus.

1139
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Oh my god.

1140
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Wow. So they've

1141
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
identified the worker, a 36 year old from Coon Rapids,

1142
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
and that charges are in the near future. She is not cooperating with us, if you can

1143
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
believe that. They're going to add disorderly conduct charges

1144
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
and criminal damage to property. And a GoFundMe

1145
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
has been raising $7,000 for the old couple, so that's nice.

1146
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Oh, that's nice. I like that.

1147
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You know what? This is actually missing a part of the story. This is a different article than the one that

1148
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I had planned to show, so just give me a second. Give me just a moment, okay?

1149
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Listen to those taps.

1150
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Those clickety-clacks. Here it is. Alright.

1151
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Found it. Because part

1152
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
of the article was supposed to talk about who

1153
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
the person was, who this 36 year old driver was for Instacart.

1154
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
But it wasn't in there. So I just quickly found it. And here's what it is.

1155
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
If you can see it. Milliwig in chat is asking what's

1156
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Instacart before we move on. Instacart is a, do you know what Instacart is?

1157
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
No. Oh really? Okay. So Instacart is a company

1158
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
that you, there's an app and you

1159
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
put in your grocery list on the app. And they have workers who

1160
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
will go out to a store and buy the food

1161
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and then deliver it to you. And then they charge you for the delivery and they charge you for the food.

1162
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So the idea is if you can't leave your house but you have to go grocery shopping

1163
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
you can get an Instacart order.

1164
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Oh no, a lot. We don't have anything like that mainly because

1165
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
oh we do actually have something like that. It's called Ocado.

1166
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And we

1167
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
mostly don't have any competitors to Ocado

1168
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
mainly because most grocery stores

1169
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
have their own delivery services. Right. Direct to your door.

1170
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
That's not common here. So apps have kind of filled the void. And we also have

1171
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
similar ones for food delivery like Grubhub and stuff like that. Where if you want to have food

1172
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
from a restaurant that doesn't deliver delivered to you, you can go to

1173
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
there's SkipTheDishes, I think that's Canadian only, there's Grubhub

1174
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and what's the other one? Shit. Uber Eats is one of them.

1175
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
There's one more at least. We have Uber Eats and Just Eat.

1176
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Those are the two big ones here. Right. Right. Okay. So Instacart

1177
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
is just a grocery delivery service basically. But here we go. Find another slave

1178
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
fuck, find another slave racist, fuck the police pigs

1179
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and here's the person.

1180
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
This individual with purple hair named Tara. How very

1181
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
surprising. Yeah.

1182
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I wonder if she might have a political slant.

1183
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
There might be a reason why she destroyed this elderly couple's groceries.

1184
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Possibly tell. In any case, she's

1185
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
facing a 90 day jail sentence in fines.

1186
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Good fucker. I'm good fuck. Yep.

1187
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Okay. So what's this? Oh, check this out. You're going to like this.

1188
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Okay. Listen, listen, listen to this, okay?

1189
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
A 10 year old boy steals parent's car to visit his grandparents

1190
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
who are 68 miles away. And then he tells the

1191
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
police he's a dwarf who has forgotten his license.

1192
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Absolute madman. He drove his parent's car into a

1193
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
snowy ditch and he said that he was a dwarf. He just forgot his license.

1194
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
He drove more than 10 kilometers for veering

1195
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
off the road where he was found by a snow plow driver who alerted the police.

1196
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The parents had woke up, discovered that their children was missing

1197
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
and somebody had taken off with their car. They were pretty upset. The boy told the snow plow

1198
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
driver that he was a dwarf and he had forgotten his driver's license at home.

1199
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And it turns out the child wasn't injured and the car wasn't damaged and they decided not

1200
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
to file charges. Um, so I

1201
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
guess that's a good end, but wow.

1202
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Here's the thing though, getting 10 kilometers away with no driving

1203
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
experience at 10 years old, that's pretty impressive.

1204
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yeah. Is this in Canada?

1205
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
No, this is in Norway. Oh, Norway.

1206
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I was just going to say, Canada, Norway, it's still like icy as fuck.

1207
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
That's even more impressive.

1208
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Imagine having the balls to say, oh yeah, I'm just a dwarf.

1209
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Did he pass the speech check? No, I don't think he did.

1210
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I do not think he did.

1211
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Go ahead, go ahead.

1212
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I was going to say he had a 70, he needed a 75 for the speech check.

1213
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
This one is actually a much more serious one.

1214
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Jesus. That fucking, that headline is like a roller coaster.

1215
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Holy shit.

1216
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
One, I obviously, I don't feel bad for the

1217
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
boyfriend cause the boyfriend's clearly got anger issues.

1218
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
If that's, if he blew up that badly, um,

1219
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I don't think he did.

1220
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I don't think he did.

1221
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Um, yeah, discovering your wife's having an affair

1222
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
is horrible, but still, um,

1223
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
furthermore, like,

1224
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I don't really feel sympathy for her too much because she's a nonce.

1225
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Um,

1226
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
the only person I feel really sorry for is the 50 year old boy

1227
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
cause one, he got beaten the shit off by a fully grown cage fighter.

1228
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And also because he got taken advantage of by a nonce.

1229
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So, you know, what's interesting here is that in Canada, nonce means idiot.

1230
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It doesn't mean pedophile.

1231
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Nonce here means pedo.

1232
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That was the source of a lot of confusion for a long time when I was talking to British people.

1233
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You're just like, why would you want to kill idiots?

1234
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I mean, there's a good reason sometimes.

1235
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
But you know what I mean though? Like it was, it was strange to hear.

1236
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It's just like, oh no, it, nonces are unforgivable. It's just like,

1237
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
you can forgive people for being stupid.

1238
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
All right, so let's see here. Um, jealous ex-convict

1239
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Paul Robson, who was 50, carried out a vicious

1240
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
attack against Caroline Kale, 47, and her teenage lover

1241
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
after he snooped and prowled outside of her home.

1242
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
This is in the UK.

1243
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Yeah, no, it wasn't New Crassle Crown Court. This is around where I live.

1244
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It says

1245
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Linton, Northumberland.

1246
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Hold on, Linton. Give me a second. I'm gonna

1247
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
switch over to the live screen for a second.

1248
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
People won't be able to see the feed, but.

1249
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Northumberland.

1250
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Linton, Northumberland. Linton, Northumberland

1251
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
map.

1252
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
How close is that to you?

1253
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
That's

1254
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
literally within, hold on, I'll do the directions on

1255
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Google Maps. From my exact location,

1256
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
it's about a 30 minute drive. Oh jeez, that's not far at all.

1257
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
No, it's about a 30 minute drive.

1258
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
You could probably get to where they are from me on public transport.

1259
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Oh jeez. So, let's see what happened.

1260
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Robson may have stamped and kicked on her, leaving her with unsurvivable

1261
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
brain injuries, chopped off her hair in clumps, cut up her

1262
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
clothes and slashed her buttocks. Injuries to her eyes and

1263
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
neck bruising indicated she may have been strangled. He also

1264
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
attacked the boy with scissors and a meat cleaver, sprayed

1265
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
them both with ammonia and stole their phones, later updating

1266
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
her social media pretending to be her while he was on the

1267
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
run. Holy fuck. This guy's

1268
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
crazy. Yeah, this dude is insane. This makes me

1269
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
even more surprised that she did this, cause he's insane.

1270
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
She must have known he was insane. So why would she

1271
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
cheat, and furthermore, why would she cheat while being

1272
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
a nonce at the same time?

1273
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
This makes me think that she must have been, like, either

1274
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
she had no regard for her own well-being, or her

1275
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
urges to nonce were that strong that they overrode her self-preservation.

1276
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Cause something tells

1277
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
me, for that kind of blow up, she had to have known he was

1278
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
like, violent. Okay, hold on, there's something strange here.

1279
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Robson and Mrs. Kale, who were separated from her

1280
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
prison officer husband, had lived together in Linton, but split up weeks

1281
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
before the murder, and he found out she had started a relationship with the boy. It almost

1282
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
sounds like she didn't cheat on him, she just started fucking the boy

1283
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
after they broke up. Oh, okay.

1284
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Possibly, I don't know what the timeline is, but what the fuck?

1285
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
But she sounds like a real piece of work herself, not

1286
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
again, I'm not condoning what he did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I know, I agree.

1287
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Well fucking, she cheats on her prison officer

1288
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
boyfriend with him, then she breaks up with

1289
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
him and starts noncing with a 15 year old boy, and then he comes

1290
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
in and just goes ham on her.

1291
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Absolute fucking, what a shit show this entire story is.

1292
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Yeah, man. Oh god.

1293
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm trying to, this is

1294
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
all stuff that I've already read, I'm trying to find

1295
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
details of where the kid comes involved, and it's just, nope, she was just

1296
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
fucking a kid. Alright, there's no

1297
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
like extra story with him, it's just, she was

1298
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
fucking a child, and he decided to go crazy and kill her. Wow.

1299
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
What a fucking story. I know she's dead, but

1300
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
surely they should probably give more emphasis on the fact that

1301
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
what she was doing herself was incredibly illegal and immoral.

1302
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
The article actually doesn't, like it mentions the fact that it's an underage

1303
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
boy, but doesn't really play it up. I'm surprised, like

1304
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
apparently, I guess he was just so violent, that's what the whole entire article is about.

1305
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Holy shit.

1306
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I just can't help but feel that they're trying to make me sympathize for someone

1307
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
who I really feel no sympathy for at all.

1308
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Possibly, yes. Alright, let's continue.

1309
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Okay, here we go. I'm skipping this one, I'm gonna use this one for something else, I'm skipping this one.

1310
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
90 day Beyonce star.

1311
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I make $50,000 a week selling my farts in a jar.

1312
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I mean, we've all got to make a living somehow.

1313
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
A reality TV star is making waves on social

1314
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
media after letting it rip, after letting it rip

1315
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
that she makes more than $50,000 a week by selling her flatulence

1316
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
to strangers. A video detailing her

1317
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
smelly side hustle currently boasts 6.6

1318
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
million views. That's the fart of the deal.

1319
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I thought farts were super niche,

1320
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
but also something fun, quirky, and different, said Stephanie

1321
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Motto. She first gained international recognition

1322
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
after appearing on the reality TV show 90 Day Fiancé, and she has since started

1323
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
her own YouTube channel, and also, oh, she founded her own OnlyFans

1324
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
clone called Unfiltered. Oh.

1325
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
That's more of a fucking hustle than selling farts in a jar, lady.

1326
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Well, that's what I mean. It sounds like she's a businesswoman, but she's also doing this as a

1327
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
side hustle. First of all, if you have successful,

1328
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
if you have a successful business already,

1329
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
what the fuck do you need to be doing this for?

1330
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
This isn't desperation. This is just, she's fucking weird.

1331
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Listen, listen. $50,000 a week, though.

1332
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That's a lot of money. True. That is true, but freaking

1333
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
can't help but feel that this isn't 100% necessary

1334
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
for her to do. She eventually

1335
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
turned to selling her jarred farts on a platform because she thought it'd be a hilarious

1336
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
publicity move that would get a lot of people's attention. But then it turns out

1337
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
that she, the gassy gal made $50,000

1338
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
in one week from hawking her toots. Her unfiltered

1339
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
inbox is flooded daily with people wanting to purchase jars of her farts

1340
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
and that people frequently request videos of the production process

1341
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
from caboose to container. So you want to buy

1342
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
a video of this chick putting a jar up to her asshole and farting into it

1343
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
and then quickly, quickly canning it so that the smell stays there for when you buy it.

1344
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I can't even blame her

1345
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
really, because she's just responding to incentives. It's the guys who buy

1346
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
the stuff that I really hate.

1347
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
So, she

1348
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
eats beans, a protein muffin, a yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, and sometimes

1349
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
a protein shake, and then she fills the mason jar

1350
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
with flower petals, because flower petals that are scentless can

1351
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
absorb other scents and make the scents last longer. And then she farts

1352
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
into the jar of flower petals.

1353
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I like how she's put thought into this.

1354
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Like, this isn't just a thing for her, this is a proper

1355
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
business model. She's innovating on fart jars, what the fuck?

1356
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Man, okay.

1357
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I know that we were going on a couple years ago about gamer girl bathwater

1358
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
or whatever, but this chick takes it to a whole other level.

1359
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
That's what I mean. She has evolved thoughttery.

1360
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
She's innovating thoughttery.

1361
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Fucking hell. Alright, what's next? What's next? Oh.

1362
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Hold on, let me just pause this. Tennessee man

1363
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
pulls out an AK-47 after being told to

1364
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
wait 10 minutes for his Little Caesars pizza.

1365
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Fuck. I guess he fucking wanted his pizza.

1366
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
That's what I mean. That must have been some really good fucking pizza.

1367
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Have you had Little Caesars before? I haven't. I have and it's

1368
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
actually really shit. It's like the cheapest, most cardboard fucking pizza

1369
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
you can get. Like $8 for a pizza and it's just garbage.

1370
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Alright, cause my understanding was that

1371
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Little Caesars was like, my understanding is that Little Caesars did

1372
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
like, what was it called, the hot and ready pizza

1373
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
where basically they just take a pizza

1374
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
that's already been made and put it in a box and give it to you really cheap.

1375
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Yes, they do. And it's not very good. It's pretty shitty. No, I can

1376
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
imagine not. That sounds like something you would buy if you had like 15

1377
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
minutes on the clock for a lunch break or something. And that is what I did

1378
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
back, cause when I worked, the last grocery store job I worked at, there was Little Caesars

1379
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
pizza in the area, like a 2 minute walk away, so I would do that all the time.

1380
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It was so fucking bad. Okay, so

1381
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
one man allegedly went too far. When he told his Little Caesars pizza

1382
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
was not hot and ready, he pulled an AK-47 on the employees.

1383
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
He points the gun at me and he says, where's my pizza?

1384
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I want my pizza now.

1385
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
He became upset when he was told that his pizza was not in fact

1386
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
hot and ready, but he would have to wait 10 minutes for the pizza.

1387
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
He left the store, went to his car and came back with the weapon.

1388
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So

1389
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
another customer in the store who had gotten her pizza

1390
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
gave it to him, which was enough to make him leave. The employees

1391
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
then called the police who tracked him down and arrested him.

1392
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
The employees started screaming, we are not

1393
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
always hot and ready. Never listen to the commercial. We're not

1394
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
always hot and ready.

1395
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I like how that's how, where her

1396
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
mind turns to is the fact that the commercial is misleading and it's not

1397
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
just, this guy's a fucking psycho.

1398
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Like, I'm sorry about our misleading

1399
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
advertising, sir.

1400
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Right, okay, we have had a super chat so I'm going to address it.

1401
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
No problem.

1402
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Merc for $5, thank you very much. Fart in jars

1403
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
are the new NFTs.

1404
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh God. What does this AK-47 dude

1405
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
do when his girlfriend isn't hot and ready?

1406
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Alright, here's the next one that I've got.

1407
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Bay Area car break-ins are on the rise, prompting

1408
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
car owners to leave their trunks open.

1409
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Wait, isn't, wasn't this the thing that fucking

1410
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
what's-his-face Seth Rogen

1411
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
was saying wasn't an issue? Yes.

1412
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
So it turns out that people

1413
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
are just leaving their cars open with nothing in them so that the windows

1414
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
don't get destroyed as people look through them.

1415
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yeah, basically people are just saying, look, I

1416
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
have fuck all to give you, so just leave me alone.

1417
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Yep.

1418
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And I like how Seth Rogen is so disconnected

1419
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
from anything outside of California, at this point he says, oh yeah, the last 10 years

1420
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
my car's been broken into 15 times, that's totally normal.

1421
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Yep. No, it's not. It's not normal.

1422
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Maybe it's a

1423
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Canadian thing, but even in our big cities there's not that much

1424
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
thefts or car break-ins. Oh no, like, London

1425
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
is the crime capital of the UK,

1426
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
like with it being its capital city and also because it's

1427
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
really poorly run, but it's like

1428
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
and like we have rising gang warfare and rising knife

1429
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
crime and all that stuff, your car will be fine.

1430
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
So this person says

1431
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
imagine having to clean out your car and leave it

1432
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
open in the public just so people won't break the windows on it.

1433
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Oakland, we are looking sad, man.

1434
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yeah. However, the police say you shouldn't do it because

1435
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
they can steal your batteries, they can steal your tires, they can go into your glove department and find your

1436
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
insurance, so you still shouldn't do this, but

1437
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
no one's stopping these robbers.

1438
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Fuck. Just leave California, guys. Just get the fuck out of California.

1439
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I keep telling Lilith to move.

1440
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I know, but she keeps saying she's comfortable there, doesn't she? Well, what happened is she inherited

1441
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
a house. Oh, I see. So, like, at the very

1442
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
least she has to find a buyer for that if she was going to move and then move to a decent place.

1443
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And also, despite all of California's problems, the other areas of the states aren't exactly

1444
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
as trans-friendly. That's like, okay, yeah, fair enough, I get it. I understand.

1445
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
She just moved to Canada, fuck.

1446
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Even more conservative areas here, they're very much

1447
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
like, we'll just leave you alone if you're not doing anything wrong. We don't care if you're trans kind of thing.

1448
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
That's how things are here. It's pretty much the same in the

1449
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
UK, it's just fucking, as long as you

1450
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
don't, like, yeah, we're a bit grumpy, but as long as you mind

1451
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,000
your own business, no one's going to give you trouble. Yep.

1452
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I'm going to continue on. I'm sorry I called the Grinch

1453
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
anime. Please stop threatening my family.

1454
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Dear

1455
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
vindictive Japanese cartoon watchers, you know me

1456
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
as the sack of shit who referred to the Grinch as anime in a now

1457
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
viral blog post. While I have some to regret,

1458
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
while I have come to regret this post deeply, both personally and professionally,

1459
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
for the sake of my family, I must humbly request that you cease

1460
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
your highly coordinated retaliation, which has already escalated to an

1461
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
alarming degree. Fucking hell, man.

1462
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
First of all, you are wrong,

1463
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
while you are wrong that the Grinch is not an anime, it's a cartoon,

1464
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
and I will die on that hill, even though anime

1465
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
is literally just short for animation, so.

1466
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
The blowback began almost immediately with internet

1467
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
user Yu Yu Hakusho Queer, who came out of

1468
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,000
the box strong with, you pinhead fuck, the Grinch is not

1469
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
anime, I'll ensure you and your family wake up every day in harm's

1470
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
way. Minutes later, another user, Ms. Hente

1471
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Shawty, posted a Google 360 view of my mother's

1472
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
apartment with the caption, his mom's crib, do ya thang.

1473
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
The threatening remarks piled on, with a few users

1474
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
taking it to the extreme by posting photos of baby carrots and claiming,

1475
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
these are the author's penis. Those were not my penis.

1476
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
No shit. From slanderous to

1477
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
dangerous, no heinous comments were off limits from anime

1478
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
fans. It's the intimidation of my family members that have crossed moral

1479
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
bounds, the threats via email and snail mail, the bodily

1480
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
fluids on their porches, the multiple incidents of dumping hot

1481
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
hookah coals into my mother's shoes. It has all been

1482
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
shamefully too far, and for what it's worth, this is the sort of holiday destruction

1483
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
the Grinch would have wanted. I sincerely apologize

1484
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
for calling how the Grinch stole Christmas anime

1485
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
and for calling the Grinch one of the best guys in anime. This is not

1486
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
the half-hearted apology of a man fearing for the life of his family

1487
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
and the well-being of his mother.

1488
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
This is such a stupid article.

1489
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
It's literally just a case of, it's like, this reads

1490
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
like an absurdist post. Like fucking

1491
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
why are people sending death threats to this guy because he called the Grinch anime?

1492
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
The thing is... Even calling the Grinch anime sounds like a shit post.

1493
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I have a feeling, yeah yeah, you know what this is?

1494
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
He did call the Grinch an anime, and he did get

1495
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
a blowback from it, but this is him making fun of the blowback.

1496
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
That's what this is. That sounds more plausible to me,

1497
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
actually. Yeah, because The Hard Times

1498
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
is not a satire site in the same way as The Babylon Bee, but

1499
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
it does do these kind of jokey posts, yeah. I would certainly

1500
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
hope so, because otherwise, anime fans, you're different from

1501
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
when I was at my peak of anime fandom, but you need to calm

1502
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
the fuck down. Okay, there's

1503
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
like four articles left but we're running out of time, so I'm gonna do the last one.

1504
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I'm gonna do the one that I intended to end the show on, because this is

1505
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
fucking hilarious. Check this out. Somehow

1506
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Adolf Hitler has received a COVID vaccine passport

1507
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
in the EU. I told you

1508
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
it was the Fourth Reich.

1509
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
The private key used to sign the EU's digital COVID certificates

1510
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
appears to have leaked, leading to forged certificates for people,

1511
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
even dead ones like Hitler. The former Supreme Leader

1512
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
of 1940s Germany would appear to be alive and well if the EU's

1513
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
digital vaccination program is to be believed.

1514
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Actually, he's doing better than well. He's been vaccinated for COVID-19.

1515
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Well, very nice. Yeah, no, Hitler is still

1516
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
dead, don't worry. Yeah, nobody's, nobody's out there, you know,

1517
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
making clones of Hitler and like raising them up in cryogenic

1518
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
stasis in Argentina or something, all right? No one's actually doing that.

1519
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It's not some really cringey action movie where he takes off his glasses and goes, my god,

1520
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
he's back.

1521
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
It would appear that someone has gotten their hands on the private cryptographic

1522
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
key used to certify digital COVID-19 vaccination

1523
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
cards in certain European countries and has been forging bullshit

1524
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
certificates for real people. Cyber criminals in the dark web were recently

1525
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
spotted selling access to what they claimed were forged digital vaccination

1526
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
certificates for $300 a pop. When asked by journalists what they were doing,

1527
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,000
one criminal provided them with a working, a working vaccine certificate

1528
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
for Adolf Hitler. In addition to the former dictator, approved

1529
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
vaccine passports for Mickey Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants were also

1530
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
being hawked. Well, you have to, you have to imagine

1531
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
that he doesn't want to get isolated in Mickey Mouse's clubhouse

1532
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
and you know, Bikini Bottom's been on lockdown for the past

1533
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
six months, so you know, he wants to get outside, he wants to breathe some

1534
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
fresh air again. The fake but approved

1535
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
certificates were recently viewed and they were able to verify

1536
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
that Hitler's was still working as of Thursday.

1537
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
The fake certificates appear to be sourced from some kind of compromise of the EU's

1538
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
digital vaccination certificate program, which is Europe's recently instituted

1539
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
effort to ensure that all citizens are vaxxed before they can travel or attend most

1540
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
recreational events. Also called the Green Pass, the certificate

1541
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
can be obtained through a variety of methods, either via health agencies or testing

1542
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
centres following vaccination. And it's pretty much a requirement if you want to see a movie,

1543
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
eat a restaurant, or do anything that involves fun. According to the European Commission, the pass

1544
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
contains a QR code with a digital signature. However, it would appear that

1545
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
the private key responsible for validating those certificates has been leaked

1546
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
or misused. Because now they're just making a bunch of joke certificates.

1547
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
That's fucking great. Man.

1548
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Actually, as someone in the chat pointed out, Adolf Hitler

1549
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
literally won an election in Namibia last year. I did that article too.

1550
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
There was a guy who was, it was a former German colony

1551
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
and they didn't really know much about World War II. So people there

1552
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
were just naming their kids after like their grandparents or whatever. And they had, they sometimes had

1553
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
German names. So one kid grows up with the name Adolf Hitler

1554
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
not knowing what it means and he wins an election

1555
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
in Namibia. And then he has to like tell the world, uh, I know I don't

1556
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
intend to take over the entire world. I'm sorry.

1557
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Fucking.

1558
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
You sometimes forget the

1559
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
fucking, just how big the world is, don't you?

1560
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Bullshit can happen.

1561
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
So it seems like someone got a hold

1562
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
of how you make these certificates and has just been making fake ones.

1563
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Like crazy. Including one for Adolf Hitler.

1564
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I like how he hasn't just been making fake ones for other people. He's just been

1565
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
making shitpost ones as well. To be fair, he's probably doing both.

1566
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
He's just doing the other ones like silently. That's happening here. There's like

1567
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
there are doctors who don't agree with the vaccine passports, even

1568
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
though they're like pro-vax and they will just give you an exemption now.

1569
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Cause like, fuck it, we got to stop this. So there are some doctors who are just like silently handing out

1570
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
exemptions. Yeah. And there's like a lot of places here that aren't

1571
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
accepting them either. You know, they're not, they're not

1572
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
when places, like, okay, hold on.

1573
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Now you have to have your phone scanned to go into a restaurant, but there are some restaurants here that are just like

1574
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
we're not going to bother with that shit. That's fucking bullshit. We're not going to scan.

1575
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It's like, oh, cool. That's how it should be. No one should be listening to this anymore. It's fucking ridiculous.

1576
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Anyway, that's the articles.

1577
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I have like five more, but we've run out of time. So I will do

1578
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
those next week. It's not a big deal. Let me just, okay.

1579
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Yeah. I have switched, yeah, I have switched us back to

1580
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
the live, to the live screen. So it's literally just the picture of Shinji with a

1581
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,000
coffee. Shinji?

1582
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Shinji with a coffee. Yeah. Why Shinji though?

1583
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Because it was the weekly sip and it was the first thing that came to mind that was both anime

1584
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
and was coffee related.

1585
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Awesome. Plus it was

1586
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
the thing about Shinji is that he looks vaguely like me if I was

1587
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
if I was thin and scrawny. And also the fact that

1588
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
he also like, he looked, it's

1589
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
in that picture, he just looks mildly unimpressed.

1590
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So wait,

1591
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
are you saying that you would jack off over an unconscious woman's body?

1592
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
No, I would not do that.

1593
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
You wouldn't do, you wouldn't do the ultimate Shinji move?

1594
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I'm so fucked up.

1595
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Actually, okay, that got

1596
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
back when that movie first came out in like 2005 or whatever it was, that movie

1597
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
got put on Canada's official list of banned, banned

1598
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
movies because of child porn in it.

1599
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Because it showed Asuka's tits. Oh God.

1600
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Canada is terrible when it comes to animated CP like

1601
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
stuff. Okay. If you, if you own a copy of that movie

1602
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
in Canada, like a legit copy that you bought, you can go to jail for the same length

1603
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
of time as a child molester.

1604
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yeah. That's fucked. And here's the thing,

1605
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
nobody wants to tackle the problem because who wants to be the guy

1606
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
that like takes on that bad optics, you know, of

1607
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
oh, you're the one who wants to make drawn child porn legal.

1608
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
It's like Jesus. Even, everyone knows

1609
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
that it's stupid, it's too far, but no one wants to be the person who has that

1610
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
on their legacy, you know what I mean?

1611
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Yeah, I get what you mean. Right. We do have

1612
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Jackson for five dollars, thank you very much. Trans Acceptance is

1613
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
so far in Canada that my very conservative parents over ten years ago

1614
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
were not willing to accept I was trans just because I cross-dressed on a

1615
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
dare once.

1616
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
That sounds about right. Like lots of Canadians are, lots of Canadians are just

1617
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
like, I don't care what you do in private, just as long as you're not like

1618
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
being fucking ridiculous like a lot of people are, as long as you're just like

1619
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
being a regular person, you can do whatever weird shit you want. It's like, okay, cool. You know, that's how it should be.

1620
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Yeah, that sounds violently Canadian.

1621
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Like, nobody likes pride parades,

1622
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
nobody likes big demonstrations, nobody likes violent demonstrations.

1623
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
But if you're just like, if you're gay or if you're trans and you're just hanging out and being a regular

1624
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
person, nobody here gives a shit.

1625
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
It's like, yeah, it's pretty much the same in the UK.

1626
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
You will get some areas where people, where like the odd individual

1627
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,000
will be a dick about it, but for the most part it is just people

1628
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
who are just like, alright, fair enough.

1629
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Like, let's take, like

1630
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I'm sure if you've kept up with Count Dankula,

1631
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
like Count Dankula's Twitter, you'll have seen a regular poster on there called

1632
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Femboy Blacksmith.

1633
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
He goes to college dressed in girls' clothes

1634
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
and no one cares. Like,

1635
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
no one gives a shit.

1636
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And as far as I can remember, it's been like that since the 90s. Like, maybe not earlier, like in the

1637
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
80s had some legit homophobia floating around in there, but then

1638
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
when the 90s came around, it was like, who cares anymore?

1639
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
People were just like, private, you know?

1640
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Well, put it this way. In the 1960s, I think it was a case of like,

1641
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
two thirds of people found homosexuality to be, you know,

1642
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
like horrible. And then by

1643
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
97, I think it was, this is a statistic I saw years

1644
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
ago, so I might be getting the exact date wrong. I think it was something like

1645
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
only 10% of people found homosexuality to be wrong.

1646
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Yep. Yep. Honestly, like a lot of those

1647
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
social problems have been solved at this point. People are just getting crazy online

1648
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
over fucking nothing.

1649
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
All right. I think that's about the end for me though. Who do you have on next?

1650
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Single player Carl and Charles Akitsune.

1651
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I'm supposed to go on their podcast at some point. That's right.

1652
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah. It's a good podcast. It's a good laugh.

1653
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I'm an editor for Single Player Carl,

1654
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
so he's like, not only is it a good

1655
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
laugh, they're also very interesting to talk to. So I'd highly recommend it.

1656
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Right, right. Does, does Chaos Charge still work

1657
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
for It's a Gundam? I know he was like his

1658
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
either editor or something along those lines for a while.

1659
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Well, he did rig the

1660
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Gundam 3D model for him. Yes. I'm not sure

1661
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
if he was ever like an editor or something. He's not stewed.

1662
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
That's a misconception. People thought he was stew. He's not.

1663
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
That's a misconception, but he

1664
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I do know that he did rig his 3D model for him. Oh, who's stew then?

1665
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Stew's just a character. It's made up.

1666
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Yeah, see, I think that's why last time I talked to Gundam, he said

1667
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
that Charza was stew in spirit.

1668
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Yeah. Because basically

1669
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
what happened was is that people started assuming that and he said

1670
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and people, so, and it kind of Charza started

1671
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,000
going along with it for a laugh, just, you know,

1672
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
started going along with it just, you know, to

1673
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
just for a laugh, but it got so prevalent that Gundam kind of pulled him

1674
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
aside and said, yeah, we're going to have to stop doing that now because people actually believe it's

1675
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
true. Oh, well.

1676
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Yeah. And to be fair, Dave on my side of things, Dave is a real person.

1677
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I mean, kind of. He's like, he's half alive.

1678
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
He's in a constant state

1679
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
of potential undeath, but he is

1680
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,000
technically in a legal sense alive.

1681
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Yes, yes, that is the case.

1682
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Jackson for another $5. I feel I should clarify this was in Alberta as well.

1683
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Okay, fair enough. Yeah, Alberta is like Canada's Texas.

1684
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Lots of oil, lots of conservatives, lots of people who want to leave Canada.

1685
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
It's basically the same thing culturally as Texas is.

1686
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
And even then, they're still very live and let live there.

1687
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,000
You know? Yeah. Alright, I should probably

1688
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
go then because it is 12.59 and my time's up at 1.

1689
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
So, I will see you later, man.

1690
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Right, I'll catch you about. Thanks for listening. Yeah, no problem.

1691
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
See you later, Chat. Thanks for coming in. Bye-bye.

1692
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
And there we go. That's that. Definitely a very different

1693
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
weekly sip, but hey, it's always good to try something new.

1694
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I will see you guys later. I gotta stream tonight.

1695
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
More Yakuza. I know usually Adam and Sitch stream, but fuck it.

1696
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I gotta catch up on my Yakuza playthrough on the gaming channel, so

1697
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
drop by the Twitch channel tonight or on the gaming YouTube, one or the other.

1698
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
And hopefully I'll have a new video for you tomorrow. Catch you next time,

1699
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
guys! I love you.
