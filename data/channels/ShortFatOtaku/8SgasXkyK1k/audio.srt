1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
you

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,880
All you guys saying that I was gonna be late you were wrong. I mean, I'm early

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,100
But we're definitely gay. All right. Yes. I'm probably late. Definitely gay. Yeah. Hey guys, welcome to week this up

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Mmm

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
What's going on? Oh

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,800
Things are shaking. I know there are some people who have been like, I don't want they help me to be on the sip anymore

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
I don't care. I'll do whatever I want. I

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,040
Do not care I don't care I will do whatever I like

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,880
Hey dev new timer to the discord, well, don't worry, there'll be a new disco

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,100
Actually, I need to work on that today in fact after we're done here

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,060
Well, you don't need to have an entire conversation about it

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,020
Yeah, yeah, okay, but where's the media literacy video on the side channel and it's not coming out yet

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,380
Basically all my demonetized videos were moved over to the side channel

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,660
They're coming out once a day to avoid like fucking everyone's upload feed

15
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,980
So

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,260
See my list of things that offend Twitter freaks. No

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,100
No from the sip let's try to get ahold of nowadays she's very busy. All right, Peter. Fuck you are done

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,660
If he does third chair, thanks for the $2

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,220
Fuck. Yeah, let's been too busy with real life stuff. So I've been brought in as the unfortunate replacement

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,220
You're not even on the tubcast. Yeah, I know

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,140
So here's the thing I want to outline real quick what I gotta do today

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,100
Yeah, I want to I already wrote that one script that big long one. Yeah, I

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,540
Put I don't know if you guys saw it's an hour and 20 it's an hour and 20 minutes and it's gonna be fucking huge

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,020
It's we're gonna edit down to about 45. I think

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:06,300
But it's gonna be about like Sargon and James Lindsay's feud and but more importantly the idea is they're feuding over, okay

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,820
Dev cream, please not bring up Trump this time. Oh too late. Okay, that's okay. That's fine. That's fine. You don't bring up Trump. Okay, so

27
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
I

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,240
Talk about your cash as well and we get this out first so I want to write at least one more video. I want to

29
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,620
Maybe record tick-tock Tuesday today. Mmm sometime in the afternoon

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,980
It'll probably time to be honest we have a whole day ahead of us

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,980
I

32
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
See it real late anyways, I don't care

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,180
um

34
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,060
What else

35
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,060
The discord I want to work on

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,900
and

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,820
If all if all goes well, and I'm not being a fucking blob, which I probably am

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,300
I didn't do a stream last night. So I was working all night on that long video

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,540
I would like to fire up a tune extreme or something like some sort of make it up to you guys stream

40
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,080
If I do that, it'll be late at night though. It'll be the late stream

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:13,620
Because I want to because these these things I just listed off the discord the new discord the the tik-tok Tuesday

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,620
And then the new script they're all priorities, right?

43
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
so this the the

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,440
The tune extreme will be maybe probably not

45
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,640
But it might be a bonus surprise if I can keep it together then why mention it

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,800
Why not just have it be a surprise. So like I like laying on my thoughts. Okay

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,080
$5 from our nose following Naomi and Louis has never been hurt on the same stream together quince

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,500
I think I think you have I think you came in and likes talking to the Michael little hose on the stream once

49
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,080
Yeah

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,940
There was there's definitely been at least a couple of times were like

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Somebody yelled a question at me through you and then I answered through the mic

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Yep

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,200
Coming tricky Mario, I'm doing my best but hey

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,240
If for some reason I decided to turn this channel that this channel into just like a fucking stream channel, it's my business

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Yeah, but you're I've always taken the opinion that I'm just gonna do whatever I want

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,880
Yeah, I know but your actual thought out videos are the better videos. Yeah, maybe yeah, that's no no, maybe

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,840
Fact

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,360
Zonta $5 coach red pill Russian spy and

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,960
Propagandist has passed from pneumonia

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,440
Of course Carl's who's Carlson and Don Jr. Who's Don jr. These people with the mentor Russian propagandist passing away

61
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,880
I should do a video on coach red pill to be honest because I mean

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,760
At that he's dead. He's not gonna be relevant ever again from this point on like he's fucking he just died

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
so if I have a bunch of um, I have a bunch of

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Coach red pill stuff saved up from the internet blood sports days. I might as well drop it

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,700
So fuck it like not now is the time to make a video on coach red pill

66
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,520
No, he's a fucking asshole he was an asshole back then he's an asshole now

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
It's been like four or five days already

68
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,040
Another we have to wait a week till you found out then make news

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,480
Yeah, that's how that's how the niceties of the world work

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
hmm

71
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,840
It was apparently from neglect

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,340
Yeah, I heard like he he was in a Ukrainian prison because he was living in Ukraine

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,240
Spouting Russian propaganda getting paid with a Russian. So of course, he got fucking arrested

74
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,400
He's like what a retard right but even if you agree with Russia, like how dumb can you fucking be, right?

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,160
Don't live in Ukraine during a war with Russia and then spout Russian propaganda on the internet. Yeah, it's no so he

76
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,600
Gets you actually didn't you try to like hop the border into Hungary or Poland or something and he got arrested at the border

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,520
So he was put in a prison and the prison sucked and he caught pneumonia

78
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,280
Well, he was in the prison and there the conditions were just so poor

79
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,080
He just fucking died good to know that prison conditions all over the world are the same

80
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,200
He was also a spy when he avoided prison the first time and riding up the five spies he was working with fucking hell

81
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,840
Dude, I enjoy about $20. Thank you that video better mentioned liberalism self-destructive nature demand

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,560
You fight with the hand tied behind your back fact that defies your rule doesn't the reflection of your rules just because we're better

83
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,760
That will be actually a different conversation. I'm talking about philosophy not necessarily practical

84
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,320
implementation

85
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
But I do agree with you there

86
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,920
So basically, um, yeah, I have a lot of things I want to do today Oh

87
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,620
Speaking of the discord. Yep. New there's a new discord being built because the old ones a fucking trash fire new discord coming soon

89
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
I'll make sure to announce to people

90
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,240
Shouldn't you say that because of discord's new rules that to discourse new rules as well

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, well no cuz like discord's new rules means that the new discord server is gonna be a lot more like it has to be stricter

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
authoritarian

94
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,560
Like most anything that dev has ever done I have to because discord's like

95
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:15,160
Discord will fucking ban everyone on a server if someone on that server misgenders like it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah

96
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,800
So fucking awful, so I'm making a discord, um, what else

97
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
What else is really important to talk about? Oh

98
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,000
So

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,640
I haven't been talking about this anywhere else, but I have been talking about on the weekly sip

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
So I'll talk about it again here

101
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Thank you very much. Derek. Appreciate it

102
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Glad you enjoy. Um

103
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,880
so I

104
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,240
Did finally decide to try vyvanse? Oh

105
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,760
Yeah, I've been talking about like okay. I didn't realize you were talking about it on the set good to know

106
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
but only in the set

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
only only sippers know and

108
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:02,320
And here I'll give you my vyvanse take okay one it was way too easy to get

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,120
Considering that it's basically controlled meth. Mm-hmm. I

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,280
Feel like anybody sufficiently smart enough whether or not they think they have any sort of condition that requires vyvanse

111
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,120
can simply walk in fake it and get it because I I had a

112
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Bottle like I went into the fucking

113
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,960
The the clinic I had a bottle of vyvanse within an hour. Yep. Congratulations

114
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,960
That is the same drug as I don't know how much destiny takes yeah, but it is the same drug. Yeah

115
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,440
You know, I'm gonna feel real stupid if I ever go to the doctors and I'm just like hey

116
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,520
Maybe I should try this and they're gonna be like yeah here and I'm just like I should have done this like

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,120
Yeah, I won't just go cuz I'm lazy and I'm also not as smart as you

118
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
So I might not get it

119
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Like I was talking about after I came back home

120
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,440
I spoke to Taft edge for a whole bunch because we were talking about it now. It's just like, you know

121
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,960
The best way to learn how to lie is to watch Death Note, all right

122
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:15,960
To learn how to not lie like Light Yagami who makes all these fucking crazy ass faces anytime he's lying

123
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,960
Like when when Light Yagami lays out his thought process for lying

124
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
He'll say okay

125
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,520
You need to adopt a personality of the person who is innocent of the thing that you've actually done

126
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah

127
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,800
Which might mean in some instances implicating yourself in some way because that's what an innocent person would do

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,160
right

129
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,320
So yeah, of course I was at the crime scene

130
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,560
I just walked through cuz I was walking there like I walk there every day, you know

131
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,960
Like do something like that right where that's how you lie effectively is

132
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,360
You even if it means you you you hurt your own case in the short term

133
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,800
You you have to present something you have to present a false

134
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,660
Psychology that is consistent with a person who is actually telling the truth, right? So

135
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,360
That's a really good tip on how to lie, right? And so

136
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,840
when I was like sitting in the doctor's office and I was like I

137
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,260
Was thinking about it

138
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm gonna lie about maybe

139
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,640
Felt like, you know, it felt like I was lying when I was laying it out because here's the thing

140
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
if she asked me to like

141
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,120
You know focus on something for 15 minutes as part of a test

142
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,840
And if I and if I couldn't do it, then I would be given the drugs

143
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,280
I could definitely focus on the 15 minutes

144
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,160
So I did feel like I was lying almost like everything everything that I filled out in the form was completely true

145
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,480
But it also felt like it wasn't even though I knew it was like it's like, okay

146
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,920
Well, do you do this behavior? It's like yes, I do. Do you do this behavior? It's like yes

147
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,640
I do like I was checking them off checking like yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, I do

148
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Right, but it also felt like a construction

149
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,920
It felt like I was constructing the personality of somebody who was actually quite ill. Mm-hmm. You know, I mean, yeah

150
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,080
Well, I mean that's the problem with like being able to have good days and bad days, right?

151
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,600
Like you're a competent enough person that you can actually go to the doctor to get shit

152
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,260
You need to be fair to me took me five days to actually go to like I suppose go on Monday

153
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,200
No, I know but like it's still the fact that you can force yourself to go

154
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,560
You're not like a person who's like stuck like in a home like who's like actually

155
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,520
Helpless and can't force themselves to do anything. So it's definitely a what's that called?

156
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,800
I'm gonna read this super chat. Okay, sure. No, no, I'm done. That's fine. What's that called? What?

157
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,720
Okay, well there you go I knew you're done okay here in the lead of Columbia

158
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Thanks for ten dollars

159
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,680
When things James Lindsay makes clear is that any response against the left has to be measured and well thought out

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,640
Because like because the opponent's reaction is the left's goal like in Spain or Argentina

161
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,000
Um, yeah, that's true. That's definitely true for sure. I agree

162
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Hi food drops. Oh

163
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,020
My grandfather was a b-17 tail gun in World War two. He passed away r.i.p. Dude. I'm r.i.p. Grandpa

164
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,720
Dev hasn't seen code geass. I've been trying to convince him to not yet. Sorry. It's really good

165
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,340
You should watch I think I saw like a first episode with a long fucking time. You should watch all of it

166
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
It's really good. Yes, you gotta lean in more

167
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,480
Stop okay. So basically basically like

168
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,360
It's one of those things where I would say before vyvanse, I

169
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,680
Hey Jew lady, what about the tunnels? Have you got tunnels underneath the house yet? No. Maybe if it was like, only our house

170
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,320
Someone else was in the basement. Yeah. Okay. So here here, let me try to lay this out real quick. Okay, so

171
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
Basically, I would say before

172
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
vyvanse I

173
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,560
I had what I would call a sufficiently productive day about 30% of my of the time

174
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
That's not about right. I yeah we're like a lot of days

175
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,800
I'd be trying to do work and I just I'd be forcing it and it wouldn't be happening or I do way less work than

176
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,600
I should or I'd like do other semi-productive work that wasn't essential like cleaning the house or something, right?

177
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
You know what I mean?

178
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,600
And there has been some difference

179
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Since it's been four days, so there's not gonna be a fucking crazy difference yet, right? And also

180
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,600
I'd say watch gundam. I already watched gundam. You're at a really low dose, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So here's the thing

181
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,080
I was given a 10 milligram dose for the first week and then a 20 milligram dose after that right and so

182
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,240
Basically with the first week I was given a 10 milligram dose for the first week and then a 20 milligram dose after that

183
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Basically with 10 milligrams

184
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,480
um

185
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,400
Dom said it was a uh, it was a child's dose, right? Which makes sense

186
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,920
But also here's the thing like on the one hand vyvanse doesn't like alcohol

187
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,840
So it doesn't like it's not like you need more because you're heavier. I'm a fat guy, right?

188
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,800
It's not like that, right? So it'll affect the same amount no matter what but also

189
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,240
High blood pressure is an issue for me because i'm overweight and i'm out of shape, right?

190
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
And there definitely has been like oh same

191
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,760
No being overweight enough shape you can be out of shape and overweight, okay. Yeah, you definitely can yeah. Oh, well, yeah

192
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Okay, I guess never mind. Yeah, never mind

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,040
It's called being thin fat. Yes winter wait winter dev is the laziest stuff. Yeah. Thanks for two dollars, man

194
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,520
It is kind of winter and summer dev are the same dev. Are they? Yes. Are they really? Yes

195
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah, so i'm so here's the thing i'm still on the initial like ramp in week where the idea is the doctors

196
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Okay here i'll give you one week of 10

197
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,760
And then like a month and and like six weeks or something of 20

198
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
and basically this will be like the trial where like

199
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,520
The 10 will ramp you up and then the 20 will be where you stay. I mean like dom's on 30. Um,

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know where what?

201
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm, pretty sure that's common. Yep. Sure. Yeah

202
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,760
Did I say something I should have said I don't know everyone forget what I just said the point is

203
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,120
The point okay food shops show feet jesus. Okay. The point is

204
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,760
Is that um, i'm still in the ramp up period but I have noticed like a little bit of a difference

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But it's not like you know when you get high

206
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,480
Hold on you wouldn't know no

207
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,440
Lots of people report getting high and they feel it in that not just in their body, but in their mind

208
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,680
Lots of people get drunk and they feel it not just in their body, but in their mind, right? Yes

209
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,160
I've never felt any drugs in my mind. That's because you don't take drugs even when I have

210
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Only my body whenever like

211
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,960
I i've definitely like had enough alcohol to be considered drunk before and it's only ever and it's only ever affected

212
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,840
It hasn't affected how I think it's only been like oh jesus. I can't fucking move like anything properly

213
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,560
But my brain's like pretty much intact. Um

214
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,960
and um

215
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,320
Same with same with weed right where it's like but you've done like once

216
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,680
I've done both these like a handful of times not very much though. It's been like over 10 years before

217
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
It's only it's been like over 10 years

218
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,320
So I expected that there'd be some sort of effect

219
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,120
On vyvanse

220
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
And there hasn't been I think the exact same way

221
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,760
People who are like people say like listen if you take adhd medication, you're gonna lose all your creativity. That doesn't happen now, maybe

222
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,360
If I get more which i'm going to it might as if if the dose goes up I might yeah

223
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,040
It's only been a few days. I think you need to like actually take a longer time before you form an opinion

224
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,760
Yep, it's very true. Um, however

225
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,800
At the same time I have noticed that my twitter binges when I go on them

226
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,200
They don't last three to six hours anymore

227
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,640
They last about 15 minutes and then I get bored of them and then I go do something else

228
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,400
And it's actually no longer. It's like oh I can just stop this like oh, I don't I don't it's no longer appealing to

229
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
To reply to this fucking retard

230
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,840
Right, yeah, because you're not chasing that dopamine maybe

231
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,080
Anyway, we'll see I mean, I guess I just started so who the fuck knows right? Yep

232
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,360
You're in your mid 30s all your career creativity is gonna anyway nah, that's not true i'm still pretty creative

233
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,240
I mean, what about those like musicians that are still like still going like 70 plus still making new music. That's actually good

234
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
so

235
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,720
And also like another a side effect of it one is high blood pressure

236
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,800
So I need to keep it and I need to keep a start working out more. I need to but also

237
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,640
Another part of it is yeah, I've got like fucking once every two weeks right now the the other the other part of it

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
Is um

239
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,080
It's not attention span. It's it's not actually affecting my attention span. It's affecting my ability to

240
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,040
drop

241
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,380
a negative feedback loop of reinforcement

242
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,200
That's what it's affecting right? So like every tweet on twitter is like another loop. It's another cycle

243
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,360
And getting the next tweet is always like when i'm arguing with somebody

244
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,760
It's like the next reply the next reply the next reply and it's all and each one is its own reward

245
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Like i'm talking about like psychological reward, right?

246
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,200
Yeah, well, I think it's more serotonin, but whatever either whatever happy drug. Here's the thing. You're using dopamine in the meme way

247
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I get it. Okay, so

248
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
but basically

249
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Um, it gets to the point where it's like

250
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
Like for example, lots of people with adhd

251
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
They'll like hyper focus on like a video game for 18 hours a day, which I have done before right?

252
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,800
And it's because video games have this reliable reward pathway where like you're always

253
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,760
Attracted to the game because you're because you're getting steady

254
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,520
You're you're getting steady advancement through work in the context of the game

255
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
So like every time you do something in the game

256
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,880
It takes a little bit of effort and you get a little bit of reward and it's the steady feed which is like which which is

257
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,560
Extremely appealing to people who have adhd, right?

258
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
um

259
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,920
But also if you're sat down to do something that is very intellectual and very tough like writing for several hours that can be harder

260
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
and i've definitely been in days where it's like

261
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,680
I need to write this and I fucking can't get myself to do it because I can't like I can't fucking do it, right?

262
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,200
Um

263
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,880
So the fact that I was able to like I was able to write just out of fucking nowhere. I was able to keep

264
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,560
My mind on the task of writing this giant script that ended up being an hour and 20 minute recording

265
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,200
Like a couple days after taking these pills like oh, maybe I can actually do do some of these things now

266
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,440
Um

267
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,160
So here's okay. Yeah, and also i'm sad that I don't know the tune to that song so I can't sing the super chat

268
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Song of touch

269
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,360
I'm out of shape i'm out of air, but my blood pressure is sky high fat rolls high

270
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,320
You know how to touch I know listen, I know out of touch but like not off off on the top of my head

271
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,680
Now listen

272
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,000
All I know is i'm out of touch and that's all I know really in my head. Yeah, okay

273
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Thanks lady. Columbia for the five dollars

274
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,320
So here's the thing I actually agree miss sparkles like

275
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
so so on the one hand like

276
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,760
I I genuinely have the adhd symptoms. I generally have

277
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,680
The adhd symptoms

278
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,600
Where i'm like i'm like I went down the list and I checked it off and it's like I do actually do this

279
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,040
I do actually do this. I do actually do this check check check check check, but then like

280
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,240
The fact that I came in extremely knowledgeable about the drug and its side effects, yep

281
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,120
I knew exactly what to say. I already knew what form she was going to give me to phillips. I found it online

282
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,560
And I already like I knew what to say. I knew how I knew how to how to behave

283
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,680
I had it all pre-planned in my head. So it felt like I was faking it

284
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,600
Yeah, that's because you make yourself sound like a fucking scammer. I already knew what to say

285
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,000
I researched everything I did I did I did I did it doesn't matter if the doctor might have said something else because I knew

286
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Let me put this way I went in so knowledgeable about the topic

287
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,240
That it felt like I could just drip feed her information about myself, which I did

288
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,300
To direct the conversation making yourself sound better to direct a conversation

289
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,200
To direct the conversation towards an end point that I wanted that was the correct end point

290
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,360
But nonetheless, I was the one who was in charge of that entire conversation. The doctor was going where I wanted her to go

291
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,160
You make yourself sound like a scam artist and I was just like well here's the thing

292
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,240
That's why I felt like a scam artist you make yourself sound like a scam artist that makes sense

293
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,380
Yeah, this is not imposter syndrome. This is just dev being a scammer even though he needs the drugs

294
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,160
Everyone does this and they know it. I don't do that

295
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,520
I just go to the doctor and be like I am not knowledgeable about this subject and you are because you took eight billion years

296
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Of school for it. So tell me what to do

297
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,400
So here's the thing like a lot of people in the chat are saying like this is a bad idea dev you shouldn't be medicating

298
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,320
You should be able to do fair enough, right?

299
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,160
Here's the thing like if I go on these drugs for a month and they make me worse i'll go off and i'm like

300
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,040
Oh fucking like i'm not i'm not like devoted to I must be on the drug. Look I want to try it. So i'm trying

301
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,200
I mean like that's that's the way with like antidepressants too like sometimes for some people it takes like

302
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,120
Like so many tries with like each antidepressant to like actually find one that doesn't fuck them up

303
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,720
Really bad it fucks them up in the right way. Not the bad way

304
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Yeah

305
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,660
Dev goes in age management when we get the trucker video based

306

312
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,760
Like I know I know everyone's going after food shops for the loli thing right now, but the real deep lore

313
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,520
The real deep lore is that food food shops is agp. All right, that's the jesus i'm trolling by the way

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,320
Oh, no, listen, I know I know the doctor here shit i'm actually well aware

315
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
but i'm just saying that I don't like

316
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Do all the research and make myself feel like a scam artist when I need something from a doctor

317
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,680
Luke says food shops did nothing wrong giga chat

318
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
Okay, so here

319
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
Yeah, let me put it this way. Okay guys, there's a lot of people

320
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,080
Who say um that this is not it's not a good idea for me to uh for people to go on meds including me

321
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
And you know what?

322
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,240
I like

323
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Kind of agree. Here's the thing

324
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
because

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,780
There's definitely a way there's definitely paths where like through enough meditation

326
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,600
And through enough like mindful. No, don't roll. I'm not doing giving some hippie bullshit

327
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,400
All right, like people change their behaviors all the time

328
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
through self-improvement

329
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,680
Listen just because you fucking can't don't oh, yeah

330
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,840
Don't you say the fucking man who's just like I want to move in like two years after we started dating

331
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,160
I'm gonna lose all this weight and get my fucking eight pack

332
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,320
It has how long has it been it's been seven fucking years you got even fatter and we were still in the same place

333
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,800
Yeah, I don't want to fucking hear your rules about oh anyone can just as long as they like do this and this ever

334
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,080
No, sometimes you just fucking need the medication to take that step to get you there. It's very possible. Yes. Yes. No, that's the truth

335
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Sometimes you know, not everyone does because they have wait, let me explain what i'm gonna say you fuck

336
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,320
Also, hold on a lot of this is also your fault. That's why we're still here too. Yes. Yes

337
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,160
Okay, okay. Do you want to actually start airing shit on the fucking stream now me?

338
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
No, then stop

339
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,080
Don't fucking just start pulling real life shit out when I I have so much I can say with you

340
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,160
I'm holding back so much right now. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yes makes you a bad boyfriend for holding back when you when you're not

341
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,760
Okay, I won't do that then now me you fuck

342
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,840
Listen, i'm not the one giving a bad take about fucking shit like being hypocritical about myself

343
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,880
I didn't even finish the take you don't even know what's bad yet or not. Can you please yeah, but I know you know what?

344
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Shut up. Shut your fucking mouth

345
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Shut up

346
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Okay here

347
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,040
Okay here here let me put it this way, okay, so

348
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,120
there are definitely paths for people who let's say

349
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,240
They get like let's say you take like like an addict who like someone who's addicted to like league of legends or something, right?

350
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,720
Someone who like definitely will spend eight or like overwatch like 18 hours a day on overwatch and just like lose their fucking mind

351
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
Because you don't lose your mind unless you lose well, no, yeah

352
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,480
But like at the end of that 18 hour

353
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,360
League of legends or overwatch binge and you like turn the computer off. You don't feel good. You know, yeah you do if you rank up

354
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,920
No, even if you rank up like there's like a hollowness to it where you're like if you rank up it's good

355
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
No, no, you fucking

356
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,440
Degenerate listen, all right. You're definitely like when you like

357
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,200
Get caught in some sort of in some sort of like cycle of perpetual reward

358
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,440
Even if you

359
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,960
Get more wins than losses. You still feel like empty and burnt out after you're done right do it. No balls

360
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,880
Thanks for the fiber Artemis, but you still feel empty and kind of burnt out. You're like, uh, you know like you're like, uh,

361
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It like there's something there's something there

362
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,480
That like just it feels like like you fried your brain

363
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
almost

364
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,600
Doing like like spending that much time on something because it's just been constantly like feedbacking you

365
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,880
Um, you never played good video games. I'm sure I have I

366
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,440
Dude, can you hold on you never you've never been able to like relax enough to enjoy playing a game for 18 hours

367
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,800
So when I was like a kid or like a teenager

368
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
This effect that i'm describing did not exist for me

369
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,480
Yeah, I could sit there for 18 hours and play a fucking video game and just be like, yeah

370
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,800
But like in my 20s, that's when I started to feel like oh, I that's because you were supposed to be doing other things

371
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,120
Yes, well, no, it's not it's not the fact that

372
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,840
I have if i'm gonna sit around and play a video game for like all day on my day off

373
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,680
I'm gonna feel absolute terrible by myself. No, you're only gonna feel bad about yourself

374
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,640
You're supposed to be doing other things even if I had nothing to do

375
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,200
Let's say that I was like a billionaire

376
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,960
Okay, and I had nothing to do and I could just sit around for 18 hours a day playing a video game

377
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,760
I would still come out of that being like, oh that's a bit too much only after one day of 18 hours or multiple days

378
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,640
Of 18 hours, you know what probably like I do it once in a while and feel okay

379
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
but if I was doing it like

380
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,800
Every day or like multiple days in a row. I'd be like, nope. See that's understandable. Nope. That's a bit much

381
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,160
Uh, so like but here's the thing you kind of get caught in these feedback loops

382
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,920
these um

383
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,640
The these neurological cycles where like you're you're getting like the next dopamine hit constantly, right?

384
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,000
You get caught in that and so you're looping and looping and looping and looping and looping

385
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,560
Right, you use the phrase earned dopamine 18-hour gaming system versus finishing a roof makes sense

386
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,920
Yeah, but I don't even know how to start a roof. Thanks you. Thanks for 20 dollars, man

387
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,800
There's definitely like, uh, here's a personal problem. I'm talking about a personal problem. Thank you for three dollars, dude

388
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,480
um, so like here here, let me let me try to let me try to try to

389
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,640
The weight the bad gut bacteria tones for a lot of mood brain issues tons of research on it

390
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,600
I should die before you're trying that farmer crap. Oh, don't worry. My dad's actually a lot better recently sammy for sure

391
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,800
Oh, and you know what? That's another side effect of the fucking

392
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,240
Drug is my appetite's rat like is decreased by quite a bit rapidly. Uh, yeah, dude

393
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,720
It's actually day one day one. My appetite was down and it's been down ever since yep. I'm like, oh I could just not eat

394
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,280
What do we had today? I've had one piece of avocado toast and I feel like

395
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
Not hungry, but not full. I feel like satiated. Yeah. Yeah

396
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,600
I can't tell if they need any issues meds or not. Maybe i'm just poor on self-motivation or need less caffeine

397
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,480
So can I answer this? Okay, go ahead. Okay, so the actual way to be able to tell is that if you can't get yourself

398
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,360
To do the things that you know, you need to do

399
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,860
Like for a really long like if it's been like if you're just kind of noticing these symptoms attempt to try self-discipline

400
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,280
And if self-discipline works great, but if it's been like many many many years and it's just like oh, well

401
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Maybe i'm just poor at self-motivation

402
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,200
Yes, because you need some pills to help you out. Maybe maybe to help out your self-motivation just a little bit

403
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,720
This is like years years of notice. There's there's there's there's one weird trick you can actually apply. Okay?

404
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Okay

405
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,720
If you drink coffee, well, no, I make the avocado toast myself. Like we make it here

406
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,560
We don't we don't spend twelve dollars for like delivery avocado toast. It's cheap to make at home

407
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
We make we make it ourselves. Okay, so

408
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,360
If you drink coffee and rather than riling you up it calms you down

409
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,920
Then you might actually like be you might there's a decent chance you'll respond positively to adhd meds

410
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,040
Because coffee is a stimulant, but it has always calmed me down and like made me focus

411
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,720
Well, isn't that what coffee's supposed to it's just coffee's just supposed to wake you up

412
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,640
But Naomi you drink it and like bounce around and jitter

413
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,840
Because i'm not awake beforehand just because you wake up and are actually perfectly able to like go and do a task and i'm not

414
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
It's different

415
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,400
They're having these effects on day one. Well next house

416
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,520
I didn't I didn't I didn't even get to get a chance to finish what I was saying

417
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,680
Because the chat and Naomi pulled me off multiple tracks regard

418
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
regarding the dosage

419
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
I'm seeing minor effects

420
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,920
And they are ramping up over the course of the days

421
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
But the first day I felt almost nothing

422
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,880
um

423
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Actually, I also fucked up my first dose, too

424
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,240
So if you take vitamin c with vyvanse the vitamin c neutralizes the vyvanse and I took like a fucking

425
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,080
500 milligram vitamin c tablet the same time. I took the vyvanse. I didn't know

426
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,200
It's fucking funny dude i'm like wait nothing happened

427
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
It's like oops

428
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
But no like like things i'm actually

429
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Happy with how things are ramping up

430
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,080
Because I am noticing like yeah, i'm able to log off twitter more i'm able to not waste so much time on nonsense

431
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,440
I'm able to do more writing. I feel absolutely no need to go snack in the kitchen whenever i'm bored like

432
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,160
A lot of things have already changed and it's quite nice

433
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:35,120
Um, so i'll probably stay on go take grape juice with your drugs. I'll probably stay on the regimen that I have right now

434
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,800
And if after the after the trial things need to be changed we'll change them if not i'll just yeah

435
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,920
Here's the thing right you'll just start taking actual death it'll be fine. Oh, yeah, sure

436
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
the other thing I wanted to say though is like

437
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,160
A lot of behavioral stuff

438
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,200
Theoretically can be changed through good habits and good willpower

439
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
however

440
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,280
Responsible use i'm keeping i'm on make it very clear responsible use

441
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,440
Of a prescription medication can often just get you there. Yep

442
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
That's supposed to be the point of like

443
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Stuff like this is that it just lets you live like a normie

444
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,520
instead of your your secretly depressed self well, it's funny because like

445
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,200
Like dom described it as getting her to baseline. Yeah, but I don't describe this as getting me a baseline

446
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,600
No, I describe this as getting me over baseline

447
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah, and which is why another reason i'm like maybe maybe I actually did just make it

448
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:44,400
Well, no because like the problem with like adhd and autism is that it's such a fucking wide spectrum of so many like

449
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,800
differing

450
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,240
Every symptoms and everything is that well for some people it might just be like yes

451
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
Now you're at the baseline can act like a normal person for other people

452
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,240
It's like now I can just actually focus on tasks and that's all I needed. Yeah

453
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
so so for example like, you know

454
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,800
is it

455
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:07,360
A feedback reward problem when you're like addicted to a video game when you play for 18 hours and you feel terrible afterwards. Yes

456
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But it's also a habits problem

457
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,540
And with good habits, you could actually overcome that and however, it is like a completely uphill battle to have somebody who's already predisposed

458
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,840
To engaging in those bad behaviors to build a good habit that allows them to resist those bad behaviors

459
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
You can do it, but it's not a battle

460
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,200
Well the the ideal the ideal use for for drugs like this is to get on them

461
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,800
So that you can then build the habit and then even if you get off them the habit remains because you've now

462
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,800
Because now you have behaviors that are reinforced through just daily routine and not simply

463
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:50,720
Uh a drug of some kind it's kind of like using stone staircases to get to level 100 of the skull caverns in stardew valley

464
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,960
Instead of just fighting all the monsters and finding a hole the meds are the staircases. Yeah

465
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,200
And the thing is like there is some virtue in actually fighting your way to that point

466
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,320
Because you can then say like I actually did it like it's a it's a character thing

467
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,360
I know you don't agree with me, but I think I generally think that there is sure there's stop taking the meds right now dev

468
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,880
Um, actually build the good habits that you've been saying you needed. So here's the thing even though you just chastised me for

469
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,880
For uh being stuck in in the mud for a couple of years. Here's the thing

470
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
I've gotten pretty far

471
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Without any sort of help

472
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,720
More than most people. Yeah, and i'm proud of you for that

473
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,280
Yes, well, but wait, why would you be proud of me?

474
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,080
Hold on if you don't believe no no

475
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,920
If you don't believe that there's any virtue to be found in getting through something based on your own willpower and your own efforts

476
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,560
Then why would you be proud of me for doing for doing as much as I have?

477
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
I'm proud of you. Oh

478
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,960
Because you know that i'm right i've never proud of you for anything ever again

479
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Nope, never mind

480
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
So

481
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Come on I was trying to be nice

482
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,960
Don't be nice to dev ever again. What do you mean? What do you mean?

483
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,320
But here I appreciate you being nice. No, but okay. I just want you to tell explain it to me

484
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,600
Um the fact that you can still do work

485
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,520
Okay, you know what?

486
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,680
No, I cannot explain this. I want to hear it. Listen, I can't explain this well enough

487
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,040
But thank you for the two dollars. It is pretty good for me so far

488
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
I will take the mental note not to be nice to you anymore

489
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,720
But I what why I do not have the vocabulary at the moment to explain myself

490
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,720
Dev's debate brain rot is strong to be honest. We actually do I think that actually is a problem on my end is like

491
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,040
You'll you'll say something and i'm like

492
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,760
Namely, that's the complete opposite thing of this thing that you said like three fucking weeks ago that I remember like with pinpoint precision

493
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,640
You're like what the fuck and i'm just like yeah, I mean, how come you're consistent and you're just like

494
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,040
Fuck you

495
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,640
I do this a lot and it probably is a problem on my end. Do you think I don't know?

496
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Do I I don't know do you I don't think about anything

497
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Dev do meth and beat nooms

498
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Dev doesn't understand women

499
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,840
But anyway, yeah like it's one of those things where there is virtue if you can

500
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,480
Get there yourself

501
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,800
But the people who are very puritanical about it and they're like you should therefore you should never actually like you

502
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,040
It's like no no fuck that like if you go on drugs for a couple years and then build a bunch of good habits

503
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,000
Then go off of them and those habits maintain and you have like a good life

504
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,880
Like what I don't see a problem with that. You know what I mean? That seems like it's it's good. It's okay

505
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Uh, what do you think sure

506
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Okay, listen just because you're currently mad at me for really bad reasons

507
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,120
Yeah, doesn't mean it doesn't mean that you you can just not reply on the fucking show. I did reply. I said sure

508
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,920
I'll also pay more attention to the chat than you because they deserve it. So you know what?

509
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,360
I got breast implants because of foreign. Wait what food shops really? I mean, why not breast implants are good

510
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Dev is doing meth. Yeah giant tips like I know like meth is the meme but vyvanse isn't exactly meth. Yeah

511
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,080
And things are doing actually, okay. You know what like it's I I you know what let me put it this way

512
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,920
Okay

513
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
I am starting to see

514
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
uh certain improvements

515
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,200
They are ramping up. I'm liking where this is going

516
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,800
But if like if things go wrong, i'll stop but right now I actually feel pretty okay

517
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,560
The only downside is that I had a heart attack a couple days ago, but that's fine. We'll just get we'll just get through it

518
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,040
Nobody's giving me like a weird look did you no i'm joking

519
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Oh

520
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
That's what you get for being mad

521
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,920
You get trolled

522
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,760
Hi, i'm dev and I make jokes low

523
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,240
But i'm gonna make it a totally straight tone and then just wait to see if people realize it's a joke

524
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,640
Even though I know it doesn't sound like a fucking joke

525
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Jesus fucking christ

526
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
I'm, so fucking done with you

527
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,760
I've only been up for like two fucking hours. I'm already tired of being alive

528
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,480
Five dollars, I didn't have a heart attack. We're joking five dollars

529
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,480
Five dollars from lives and dev's walls. Thanks very much. Doug said he couldn't make it

530
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,960
He told me to tell you your butt also. Hi newms. Hey lives and dev's walls. Come comfort me

531
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Okay

532
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
We do a little troll

533
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,520
I I did figure out though that like there actually is there can be heart issues if you like

534
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,360
Okay, one if you have already high blood pressure like I do because i'm a fatty and two if you have your high blood pressure

535
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,240
One wasn't even that bad. It was only a bit higher. It was it was it was higher. Yeah only a little

536
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,560
Okay, hold on. We literally had this discussion in the car with dave and dom

537
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,280
Okay, I don't know. What should

538
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
your blood

539
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
Pressure be

540
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,080
Should be between 90 90 over 60 and 120 over 80

541
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:22,400
Okay, high blood pressure is 140 over 90 or higher low brush. Okay, so yours was 130. Okay

542
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,760
It literally takes you right there. Okay, let's see

543
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,440
Yeah

544
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
so I had

545
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,320
Hypertension

546
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,520
I had high blood pressure stage one hypertension. So it's like what between 130 and 139 or

547
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,200
180 89 so like I had that doesn't say 180. Oh, sorry 80 and 89. Yeah, so I had

548
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,160
One I think was 130 over 100

549
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,720
Okay

550
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,960
Which is definitely considered to be high blood pressure, but like I said, like it's high

551
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,520
It should be lower but you're not in a danger range yet. Yes. That's what I just said. Yeah. Yeah

552
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Thanks rock

553
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,280
So, yeah like because my blood pressure is

554
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,680
Already higher than normal. Um, they're like listen, you can take the vyvanse

555
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,160
However, it does come with higher than normal blood pressure

556
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,360
So you got to keep a watch on it like take get some blood pressure tests if you start to again

557
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,440
If you personally hit dev out

558
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Thanks for the two dollars

559
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,960
So wait if since it's two dollars does that mean I get to hit you twice? No, okay

560
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,760
It's five dollars. Can I hit you twice? No, what about ten? No, it depends on the message. Okay

561
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
So basically, um

562
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
I have to like measure it

563
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,920
Because i'm already kind of over like out of shape. I have to measure it constantly

564
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,920
and

565
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,160
I will lose weight. Yes, but also like not eating as much will help but they also said like listen do not have coffee

566
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,800
Around the same time as you have yeah vyvanse

567
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,440
Yeah, because one the coffee will actually neutralize the vyvanse the same way the vitamin c does but if it doesn't

568
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,320
You'll be hit with like a double dose and it'll like really fuck you up

569
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
And I might have had I might have had um

570
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,320
Coffee at one day. I think I think I had coffee too close to the vyvanse

571
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,040
So I was like I was like, oh I was feeling it just for a minute

572
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,440
Wait an hour is what I have to do. Oh titanium. Are you on vyvanse? I didn't know that I didn't know that wait an hour

573
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah

574
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,720
I mean, that's what I did. Uh, i've done that aside from the first day where I fucked it up

575
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,960
I've been doing that pretty consistently like waiting an hour or two

576
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,040
Yeah

577
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,680
Which sucks. I like having coffee since I wake up, but whatever, you know

578
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Coffee's done

579
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,440
We're 15 years now i've used it really so how is it for you dude i'm kind of curious

580
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,760
Normal

581
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,720
Yeah

582
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,120
Yes, I guess it'd be easier to use it just normal now

583
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
All right

584
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,920
Okay, has it really been 40 minutes what do you talk so long

585
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,520
I'm gonna open this package. I forgot to set up the camera though, but i'm gonna open the package anyway

586
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Well, listen now we won't accidentally talk someone this time

587
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,760
You literally hit the mic what are you doing it makes the autism more powerful it reigns in the age of 80d base

588
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
What what how much do you do you take titanium?

589
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,600
Oh, it's a card there's a card in here. Hold on. Thanks for the package over. It was by the way, there's peace on earth

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Look at this, but look at the button. Yeah

00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,960

621
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,160
Thank you present and yes real real sfo fans watch the gaming streams. Yes. Okay, go ahead. Let's see the present

622
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
What do you give?

623
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,800
He gave dangerous. It's milo yanopoulos's book. Oh my god

624
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,640
Wait, is this from before milo went like full retard?

625
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Oh, is that his dog that's so cute

626
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,040
boop

627
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,640
Boop to the dog snoop

628
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,720
Yeah, because here's the thing milo had I will in a minute. I just want to see their book. Okay

629
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,880
Milo is a right wing gay guy, which I still don't understand in america, but okay

630
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeah, he wrote this in 2017. Yeah, because like he went through like several

631
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,200
several iterations

632
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
of of his career

633
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,000
and right now he's gone through, uh

634
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,320
He has voluntarily gone through conversion therapy and he claims that he's now just fully straight lies, obviously

635
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,520
He's just like every other republican politician who's having sex with young boys on the side and now he's like trying

636
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
He's trying to play up like how he's this. Um

637
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,600
He's totally this completely reformed straight man who's fully christian and he looks like a fucking

638
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,880
Unironically like a fucking meth addict like he looks completely like strung out, right? Well, maybe he actually is strung out

639
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,800
Maybe maybe but this was written in 2017 when he was still on the rise and wait is milo. He's not american

640
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,440
What no he's um, he was greek who moved to britain at a very young age

641
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,480
Then he moved to america, uh when he was older. Ah, okay

642
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,360
Well, I apologize to the americans in the chat. I obviously offended

643
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,560
No

644
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,360
Yeah, milo went through like several cycles of like just relevance and fading away and relevance and like he's got he's reinvented himself several times

645
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,360
And it's all been retarded

646
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
Milo fell off so hard. Richard spencer is now higher than him

647
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:24,480
Yeah, like I saw that destiny milo debate like six months ago and milo looked like a fucking wreck. Okay, you know, okay milo looked like

648
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,680
What ken looks like?

649
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,640
Who?

650
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,400
Ken in the barbie movie when he has like the two pairs of shades and the big fur coat

651
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,160
Like like that's funny, but milo actually looked like that and he's like I look good

652
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,240
But he also looked like he was fucking like high on drugs the entire time. I'm like jesus christ. Milo. What the fuck?

653
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,000
So he doesn't look this cute anymore. No, that's unfortunate here. Hold on. So like

654
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,400
Let's see

655
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,320
milo

656
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
That's just the milk

657
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,000
Come on, but just search up his last name. Jesus. You don't even have to spell it. It's right there. It's right there

658
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,720
Damn it, you fucking boo. Okay. So like yeah, this was like milo 10 years ago

659
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,560
Not that cute

660
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,080
all right, and

661
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,080
No, yeah, like his moments, right like he's

662
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,200
He's like justin beaver. He's

663
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,680
He's definitely like kind of made a name for himself being like

664
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,480
A twink even though he's right wing

665
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,740
And he kind of went through several iterations of it, but now milo in 2023

666
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Like

667
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,040
Yeah, he fell off hard I do well I think it's also because he doesn't look that great with blonde hair yeah

668
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,640
No, just like like a lot of this a lot of this go back go back. I don't fucking know

669
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,800
Why is there a pacifier? I don't know in that woman's mouth, but here compare this right like this is when he was like

670
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,880
He was young. He was still gay. He was hot. He was still right wing. He looks like a pop song. Yep

671
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,680
Not a singer a pop song pop song

672
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
but like compare that

673
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,600
To this and the problem isn't just aging

674
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,680
Like eight there's aging present, but it's not the the problem isn't just aging

675
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,680
It's also that he's completely transformed himself into a completely unlikable person when at least before if you hated him you couldn't deny yet style

676
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
You know what? I mean like

677
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,240
Yep, damn

678
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,400
Even with the bags. He's still hot. Yeah

679
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
like he just he just

680
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,320
I don't know dude milo really fell off

681
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,800
Hold on like here. Can I see all he needs to do is dye his hair back dark. It'll look better

682
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,160
Okay, i'll i'll pull up the the video at least okay

683
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
Like yeah, yeah, yeah

684
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,560
Yeah, like what are you doing buddy?

685
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,960
He doesn't look that bad. He's also hair isn't blonde so he looks better. Oh, yeah

686
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,960
Well, it's also like the things he's saying and how he's like like he's jittering around he's talking

687
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,000
He was never like this. He looks like he's he's not even fucking present. I don't know. I'm only judging him by his looks

688
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
to the crazy gay man talk

689
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,400
Yeah, okay. Sorry. I I didn't share the screen. I'm sorry. I forgot. Okay, there's a card though another card

690
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,960
Uh from dapper tengu. Thank you

691
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,640
Another spicy book for the sfo library put it between mine camp and on the jewish question to get those twitter retards and both sides

692
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,480
howling lol

693
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,720
Thanks, dude. Oh number sign. Listen, I am very aware about how how unattractive I am. So

694
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,680
I know so fuck you number sign

695
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,960
It's like like here's the thing everyone has to get old right not me everyone has to go

696
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,440
I want to live and be young forever bullshit. You're already old

697
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,280
Everyone has to get old. Okay

698
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,080
Everyone will eventually lose whatever physical appeal they had in their youth

699
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,200
That is it

700
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,480
Even if you stay in good shape throughout your 30s and your 40s and your 50s one day if you're still alive

701
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,160
You'll be a hundred you'll be a big old bag of wrinkles and that's just how it is. All right

702
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,280
But

703
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,360
There's a difference between like aging gracefully and looking pretty good for an old person versus

704
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,160
Like being fucking madonna, okay

705
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,040
Kilometers matt for the five dollars. Thank you. Hey dev. Just want to thank you for your political insight

706
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,680
I felt alienated as a black libertarian your class and your style of classical liberal ideas fit. Well, thank you very much, dude

707
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,880
Um, i'm not a libertarian though, but i'm glad that you at least uh, enjoy my uh, my content. So thank you

708
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,000
I hope I hope it you it helps you somehow. Yeah, because like here yeah, i'm gonna I will pull this up

709
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,480
Okay, well you're gonna actually share i'll actually share the screen this time. Okay. So here, uh, let's see

710
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,720
um

711
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
What was his name?

712
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,920
Okay, yeah so like

713
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And then i'm gonna pull up

714
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,680
No, can we not look at madonna nope, we're pulling it up

715
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,800
Okay, so here i'll show you what I mean

716
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,200
Okay, yeah, i'll bring it in so

717
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,280
Here's pierce brasner with his wife, you know back in the 90s

718
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:04,560
And now like he's aged pretty gracefully. Okay, if they're in hollywood and they are aging gracefully

719
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,800
They've definitely had plastic surgery done, but it's been subtle plastic surgery. No, that's not a possible. Here's the thing like okay

720
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,440
She's 60. Yeah, and she looks great. She looks good for 60. She does but she's doing great

721
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:22,000
Probably had plastic surgery to help make herself look good. Yeah, and like just fine aside from being part of the hollywood degeneracy

722
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,760
Pierce brosons always said like why would I abandon her because she's getting older

723
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,600
So am I she you know, we've had kids together. We're a family like I love her like no

724
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,920
What the fuck like why should I have some fucking side piece like like this is my family and it's like, okay

725
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah, you know fair enough, right and I mean like like he still looks pretty good

726
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,480
Yeah, he's hot and she looks pretty good for for being 60, right?

727
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,160
Yeah, and then so like like they don't look young anymore is the point but they still look good

728
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,800
Silver foxes and cougars are my bread and butter

729
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,600
Like they look good for their age. You can't be 20 forever. So it's better to

730
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:02,320
Accept aging with dignity and and do what you can with it and settle plastic surgery and this is the good

731
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,400
The good example with subtle plastic surgery. It doesn't have to be surgery. Yes. I'm telling you if you if you can afford

732
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,920
Here's the plastic surgery. All right, that's also plastic surgery. So

733
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,320
Here's madonna

734
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,120
Here's madonna before and here's her now

735
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,320
And she looks like a fucking alien. Yep, and like

736
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,040
She I think she's also in her 60s and it's like

737
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,240
Why would you do this to yourself? You know, what's a you know, it's a better one who's who uh, pull up share

738
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,640
Share. Oh god. Yeah, you want to really see the unfortunateness pull up share because madonna

739
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,080
You know what still kind of looks the same but it's weird because we know she's old

740
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,960
But she still like sort of has the same face and I say sort of

741
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,880
Yeah, like if you try to stay young for too long, you just look alien

742
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,880
Yeah, but no you need to pull up current share 2023 versus share like 19

743
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,080
20s

744
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,720
This maybe yeah

745
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,320
like

746
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,200
It you it's kind of funny to share actually kind of looks okay there

747
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,880
But like you can tell because you can like see the outlines of her cheeks, it's weird

748
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,320
That's also kind of a good picture of current share yeah see bad pictures of share fucking no

749
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,560
That one's not great neither's that one oh, yep

750
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,680
Yeah, like yeah, she's 77 when will I feel old will you keep injecting yourself with the blood of infants?

751
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,120
Is that anne boleyn who did that no someone else I don't remember

752
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
But yeah, man like

753
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,640
This is not accepting aging gracefully no and you look worse for it like

754
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,840
You're an old lady now madonna it sucks, but that's just that's the natural cycle of life

755
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,200
You know, you don't get to be young forever. Yeah, the point is to be a hot old person not a hot

756
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,440
Like not an old person who's trying to look young and be hot. You gotta be a hot old person

757
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,600
There was actually what's funny is that like I

758
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,760
I was with my grandparents and they were like visiting we were all visiting like some of their friends

759
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,520
Or whatever and like there was a lady and she was she was super fucking hot and she was like

760
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:17,280
65 or something and she was like like super thin and she like just all the style. She looked great

761
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
No, I can't

762
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,560
Do you just did no problem

763
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
Okay, ow, ow, ow, okay

764
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,560

00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,760

768
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,120
Okay

769
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
Sigourney weaver

770
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:58,820
Pull her up dev. Okay. I'll take a look. I'll take a look search google you boomer. I'm gonna add 2023

771
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,960
Yeah, it's gonna be still hot, okay, that's uh, that's pretty good

772
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,360
I mean, yeah, she's out on the older right? Well, yeah, she's like an old lady now. Yeah

773
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,160
I want Sigourney Weaver to step on my face

774
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,720
Really?

775
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,160
She looks very old there. Well, that's awesome movie. Yeah makeup

776
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,120
So here's the thing, right like

777
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,840
People that that guy it wasn't number whatever his name was

778
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,120
He said that like you guys are talking people who fell off like this everyone gets old, right?

779
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,960
But no listen, we already fell off so ergo we can talk about everyone else

780
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,400
Everyone gets older but you don't have to get old just because you get older. You know what I mean? Like

781
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,400
Bye sketch you can find pictures of me on the show from 10 years like the gaming channel from like 10 years ago

782
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,040
And I definitely look younger and thinner. That's how it is

783
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,840
Even if i'm at the point now where even if I lose all my fat i'll probably still look older

784
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,200
That's that's just the natural cycle of life, right?

785
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,720
You don't have to you don't have to lose your spark just because you get old but I think

786
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,320
Chasing youth is what makes people lose their spark in the end. Yes. Yeah

787
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,800
So, yeah

788
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,320
Okay

789
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
That's why I tell you not to dress like a hobo

790
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,040
I just like a hobo though. You kind of do every time people complain. It's like damn, you know

791
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:20,240
I'm just i'm buying another fucking another fucking pair of shorts another fucking oversized shirt. I am full hobo mode

792
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,800
You just said you don't dress like a hobo. I said I do. I know I said I do. No, I said I do

793
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,440
You just said no, I don't dress like a hobo and then you just now said that. No, I didn't. Yeah, you did

794
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
Rewind it. I'd fuck you

795
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,320
Um tricky mario for five dollars seeing those images will forever making respect betty white

796
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,720
She ate your ice cream just I have a hundred. Yeah, man. She did it. Okay. Also listen. Oh,

797
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,640
Kilometers matt for five dollars. Thank you. As long as you hold the classical liberal ideas and hold both heads accountable

798
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,120
I don't care for the priority. Honesty is king. Here's the thing about classical liberal ideals, right is

799
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,680
They're good, but they're incomplete

800
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,380
You can't only be a classical liberal else. Everything just falls apart and it's the main reason why socialists have been undermining liberalism

801
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,780
And honestly libertarians have the same problem like here. I know a lot of you guys are libertarian

802
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,560
I'm now going to make all of you angry real quick. Okay?

803
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,600
um

804
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,900
libertarianism and socialism

805
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,880
They ultimately pursue the same goals

806
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:23,200
Now they have drastically different methods for achieving those goals and the methods are so different that they are mortal enemies

807
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,600
But they're still aiming at the same target. All right, they both claim to desire freedom

808
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:35,840
And they both claim to desire material prosperity and they both and they both claim to desire human rights

809
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:42,640
Now they have very different paths that lead to those goals to those end states, but they're aiming at the same thing

810
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,640
Else you missed the super chip

811
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,240
Oh, did I let me scroll back up? Where's it? Where's it? I don't know

812
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,640
This one compare. I said this one compared to deli parton. I don't know. I said you miss it. I I I I don't know

813
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,400
Yeah, deli parton is also fucking like terrible. Yeah, she's yeah

814
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,400
Yeah

815
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:12,880
Here goes dev talking no, it's true it's true. Yep, of course, that's true. Yes. How is it not true? It's totally true

816
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,520
He's right when you think about the basic president, of course think about it like so if you ask libertarian, what do you want?

817
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,320
He'll say freedom. He might even say equality depending at least like equality of access

818
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:34,000
Because you know if you if you um remove monopolies from the market you have equality of access to the market right so freedom equality maybe

819
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,480
uh material wealth and prosperity

820
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,320
um

821
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,400
Human rights, you know, but then you ask a socialist they'll say the same thing

822
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,120
Socials will say I also want material prosperity. I also want freedom. I also want rights

823
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,760
Wait, I thought but oh no, that's communism. Never mind

824
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,360
However, they just have very very very different ideas on how to achieve those ends, but they have the same ends

825
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,640
Now if you talk to somebody who

826
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,080
Is completely different someone who says I don't want freedom. I want order

827
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,040
Now he's actually aiming in a different target, right?

828
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,100
so

829
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,100
libertarians and socialists

830
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,120
they uh

831
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,440
And some in some very strange ways they're two sides of the same coin

832
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,980
Because they want the same things. They just have very very different ideas on how to get those things

833
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,800
If you want to be safe and secure and you don't really care about freedom that is something different yeah, yeah

834
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,120
Yeah, see here's the thing here in a leading company. Yeah communism's freedoms are not freedom. It's a here's the thing right that criticism

835
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,440
Even though I agree with it

836
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,440
That is you simply saying hey

837
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,000
The socialist says he wants freedom, but socialism won't give him freedom

838
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,640
So you're not arguing over the you're arguing over whether or not the method will get you to the end point

839
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,360
You're not arguing over the end point itself. You understand?

840
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,720
Sierra 7 10 dollars there are actually a lot of former right-wing libertarians that swap to be a bit more authoritarian because eventually they see

841
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,500
How libertarianism can't sustain itself from being undermined by socialists. Yes exactly so a lot of libertarians

842
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,080
Either they leave their ideas undeveloped which does happen a fair amount frankly

843
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:29,840
They become more authoritarian over time because they understand that you need some sort of social fabric to hold the whole freedom thing together

844
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,200
And that's like I think like dankula is slowly going that way scrump definitely went that way

845
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,720
um

846
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:42,000
Or they become more left-wing right and for example, that's kind of how lilith drifted over time

847
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,040
So I think like libertarianism

848
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,120
Is like an unstable position that reads and that falls in a certain direction

849
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,080
The rest is zero two dollars libertarian responses actually leave me alone

850
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,120
Oh, there is a coin

851
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,840
Oh, there's a uh, there's a cool. There's um

852
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,560
Dapper, thank you. Thank you. There's a piranha plant coin in here super mario

853
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,360
Oh, thanks very much, dude

854
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,280
You can flip this coin piranha plant or logo

855
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,000
Not heads or tails actually would this be heads and this would be tails probably

856
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,200
Yes, because there's no head. Well, I mean unless you count toad's head on the other side, but it's so small

857
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,600
You just dropped it under the desk. I did I dropped it under the desk. Well, it's down there now. We'll get it later

858
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,600
Yeah

859
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,800
All right, I sent a video of a dude saying that dev has socialism wrong the title says it's for sfo fans

860
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,800
Okay, I'll look at it later. Thanks miss sparkles

861
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,440
Uh, two dollars real hold center dev. Did you read my ten dollar super? I'm sure I did

862
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,280
Surely I did. I don't think we've actually missed any I think I don't think we have yeah

863
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,160
Five dollars from those and does walls. Thank you

864
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,560
I'm willing to hear arguments, but you need a stronger case than they both want good things

865
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:01,520
The stated and vision looks very different. Um, it really doesn't in some ways, right?

866
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:08,000
If you were to if you were to ask them about their ideal society, both of them will say well individuals can

867
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,360
Prosper and be free and flourish and you know, they'll have their idea and but it's all utopian bullshit, right?

868
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,640
Um, but also here's the thing when you say they both want good things that presumes that these things are good

869
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:25,760
Right, like you're presuming that freedom and equality and human rights and material prosperity are all good things and for me

870
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,900
Those can be good things in some instances and they can also be very bad things in other instances

871
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,320
Which is why i'm not on the libertarian socialist spectrum

872
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,960
Have you missed five of my bit chats on twitch? Oh, no blonde

873
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,480
Oh, you can't fucking insult me by spending one dollar to give a giant fucking paragraph anymore

874
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,560
Fuck you

875
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,040
Okay, i'll go look at him. Fuck. Okay. Let's see this bullshit

876
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,600
Okay

877
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,920
Hi, naomi. Yes. Yes. This is the milo book is from before he went full retard

878
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,880
I was actually supposed to get a signed copy of his book, but I realized he was fuck's ever put in my address. That's funny

879
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Uh, you mean why do you hate your fellow blondes?

880
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,160
In some water too, actually, um

881
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,080
I don't know

882
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,080
I hate everyone equally

883
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,280
I could be wrong but the old photo on the right might have been brosnan's first wife who died before he came

884
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,200
He became james bomb maybe

885
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,560
Maybe so but he has been dating her for like not dating married to her for like years and like decades, you know, so

886
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,040
Okay, so

887
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,680
Should we actually get on today? I mean it has been in like a full hour. It's fine. We're having fun

888
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,160
We're hanging out. You guys don't want to hang out. I don't know

889
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,800
You know, you know what would probably be better if

890
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,080
Is that we did this and then at like and then you finally get to the articles

891
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:48,560
but after we're done the stream if you are the person that puts in the time stamp of when the articles actually start in like

892
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,200
In one of the comments and pin it that's the monster. He does that. No, they don't

893
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,440
Hold on

894
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,360
Kilometers matt for five dollars. Thanks for shattering my belief steff. I'm now an anarcho-communist demi-queer trans femboy nice based

895
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:07,520
Haha, yeah, the reason that i'm a liberal and not a libertarian is because like there's obviously a place for for government

896
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:12,160
Sometimes there's actually a place for very heavy government intervention depending what we're talking about

897
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:18,640
And to ideologically be committed to the government should do everything or the government should do nothing. I think those are both failed positions

898
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,800
Like no, I don't want my co-workers having votes and what luxury goods am I allowed to purchase my personal earnings

899
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,240
See good emperor that is again a conversation about methods

900
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:36,240
Right because libertarian says the libertarian will say co-workers having votes and what luxury goods you can purchase

901
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,240
That will lead to less freedom

902
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,520
But a socialist would say co-workers having votes and what luxury goods i'm allowed to purchase will lead to more freedom

903
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,480
So you're disagreeing on method but not on goal the way out of the trap is to understand

904
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,240
That you actually shouldn't be advocating for freedom at all times. Sometimes you actually want less freedom

905
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,560
Which I know is it's a very bitter pill to swallow for westerners to actually have to understand because

906
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:07,780
Every western political school of thought whether it's liberalism or socialism or libertarianism or even conservatism

907
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:14,160
They all advocate for different types of freedom different ways to get more freedom, but sometimes freedom is actually bad

908
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,120
It just depends what we're talking about

909
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
Yes

910
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,560
Well, oh fuck there was there was oh god, I came across a fucking take from some socialist who was like

911
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,120
um hot take

912
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,320
But if the child's enjoying it and isn't injured

913
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,480
It doesn't matter if she can if if liberal society thinks she can she can consent or not

914
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,040
Okay, I want that person like to actually that's an argument from freedom because it's about consent

915
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,240
And listen, I want that person to be raped in the ass

916
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,840
With the cactus it's so ridiculous and then be like, oh well, no you you consented

917
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,320
That that person was named food shops

918
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,800
No, i'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding

919
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:59,680
If I ever if I had a gun and I ever heard someone say that in real life, I would just immediately shoot them

920
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,760
I don't care if I go to jail. I actually would

921
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,440
I 100 fucking would this is one of the reasons why I don't let myself own a gun

922
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,080
I would kill too many people

923
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:15,200
Kilometers matt two dollars. I'm not that far libertarian. I'm sitting moderate. Okay, here's another like black pill for libertarians, right? Um,

924
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,040
I know that you guys like to divide up positive and negative rights

925
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,000
But they're actually the same thing just from two different points of view

926
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,720
And you cannot truly divide them up

927
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,040
and in fact the um

928
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,440
The mechanism by which you divide them up

929
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,040
Which is basically defining who the who the who the initial aggressor is

930
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,320
That only makes sense if you value libertarian principles

931
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:41,360
And if you don't because sometimes there actually is a good reason to aggress upon somebody else if you don't

932
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
Um, then the whole thing falls apart

933
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:50,720
Uh, but that's I don't know I feel like marty mcfly being like you guys aren't ready for that one yet

934
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,520
You guys aren't ready for that one yet

935
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,800
Um, let's see I do have news articles we can talk about if you want

936
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,720
Probably should you talk about the news articles? You probably should okay

937
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,080
Acknowledge me. Hi

938
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,240
Nova two dollars from blonde. Thank you. You know, we killed plenty of people with a machete

939
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,880
But listen now that people know that I did I can't use a machete anymore that's the way it goes

940
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,200
I'll change it up

941
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Add some pizazz to my murders

942
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,120
Bro what the fuck

943
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,440
Hey food traps

944
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,280
Any example of bad freedom is overshadowed by the negative consequences of the externalities of restricting freedom in the first place. That's not true at all

945
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,680
That's not a universal rule. No

946
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,680
I

947
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,480
Like how this heart thing is just blocking it's right in the way the fucking chat. Yeah, I hate it

948
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,120
So bad at everything is this dev this dev's nrx root. Here's the thing

949
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:54,800
All right, because well no food shops will know this because she's been going through the open lettered open minor progressives. Um,

950
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,640
The neo-reactionaries have their place in politics. They have good critiques of things sometimes but

951
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,840
Their solutions are ultimately

952
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,920
um not convincing

953
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:13,200
But they've identified real problems and most liberals ignore those problems by simply screaming you guys are fascists

954
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,160
Which is not it's it's not an intellectually satisfying answer

955
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,360
Oh, don't don't get it. Wait, hold on sparkles. Listen. No, wait, wait

956
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,760
If you send the glitter package send it soon because we're moving soon

957
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,040
Okay. Well, listen our place is covered in glitter because for those of you who watch the gaming streams, you know

958
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,160
I have to wear a peach dress which I do not look good in but yeah, I think you look good in it

959
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,560
But um the thing is covered in glitter and so now there's just pink glitter everywhere all over the house

960
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,640
We just keep randomly finding it

961
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:46,240
On everything and I don't even go that many places in the house while i'm wearing that dress so

962
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,960
You can but it's already covered in glitter

963
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,160
glitter and sparkles

964
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,720
Also from dave's fairy wings, which he likes to wear all the time around the house off camera

965
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
I got into the vents

966
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,600
Sorry

967
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,960
Put more glitter on naomi and dave. Okay, we'll do

968
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,320
Yeah

969
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,360
Okay

970
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,000
She's trained you well, though. What do you mean? Listen? I say she looks good in the dress

971
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,280
I think she's good in the dress

972
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,040
Listen, if he even puts on something I don't like i'm gonna tell her i'm not that fucking cuck

973
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,480
I'll be like does my ass look fat in this it'll be like yes or no. I'll just say it

974
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,960
My ass looks fat all the time. Is it fat?

975
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,600
Well, that's pretty good

976
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:34,960
Yeah, let's be elite okay dev baby i'm sorry, but you have trump derangement syndrome late it's okay though. No, I don't know

977
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,040
Here's the thing trump derangement syndrome is marked by people who can't articulate when they don't like trump. I can articulate it very easily

978
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,000
It's not like he's orange or he's evil. He's a fat

979
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,560
No, like I can actually tell you why I don't like him. It's easy. That's because he's orange and rich. Oh

980
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,720
Okay, we should start the articles

981
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,040
Throwing a flashback

982
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,480
Is it article time guys, it's been an hour article time an hour and 10 minutes. Wait, hold on I need

983
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,400
Guys stop blonde. Thanks for five dollars dev. I'm serving for you so hard

01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,120
Fuck you. Thanks

986
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,520
Okay, so

987
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,320
uh

988
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,160
art was foul

989
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,920
I'm gonna call it artemus specifically because he's the only guy I know who might

990
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,800
Shut up, I'm not promise not to bring up trump. I never fucking said what the fuck's wrong with you

991
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:30,400
Fucking trump. You just how am I supposed to do? Well, because you're then you let me fucking say it first

992
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,840

993
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,760
Okay, hold on are you even still there oh star hawks five dollars dev you're breaking my heart you're going in a bath

994
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,760
I can't follow no

995
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:51,140
Uh sierra sierra seven ten dollars. Thank you hot take anorex accelerationists and neo left-wing people are converging towards the same conclusions

996
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,680
But accelerations want to make the problem worse. I have no idea what to do. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, i'll do with that

997
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,720
Yeah, I can't i don't think artemus is here if artemus isn't here I guess I won't yes don't I guess I won't

998
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,600
So it feels bad though feels bad I wanted to articles. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't even much from you fuck. I don't care

999
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,680
Some other goddamn political thing and we've been talking for an hour about literally nothing. No, hold on

1000
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,200
I want to ask artemus what it would take to get one of those fat

1001
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,040
100 super chats because he sometimes drops like 100 or 300 dollars before like listen if you play a certain game

1002
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,320
Or you watch a certain movie or you do a certain video on a certain topic

1003
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,720
I'll give you a big fat super chat and to be honest

1004
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:37,360
I want one of those big fat artemus requisitions because i'm i'm willing to do a video now now that

1005
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,560
Video now now that i'm all vivanced up I can answer your question now that i'm all vivanced up

1006
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,400
I can sit down and watch and do a review of whatever the fuck I can answer your question

1007
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,880
It's called you got to suck his dick more

1008
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,400
Rather than having your own

1009
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,160
um

1010
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:58,160
I'm back and looked you skipped my sit down or super whatever before you go with the package. Okay, was it?

1011
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,760
I'll go look i'll go look real quick. Okay. I'll go look before we do articles. Sorry real quick real quick

1012
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,600
Real quick

1013
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,600
Stop

1014
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,560
Your time isn't worth as much as arches fuck you see

1015
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,280
Gotta suck his dick more. Oh, no

1016
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,480
Gotta facetime live and make those motions

1017
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,320
Yep

1018
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,960
Okay, let's see if we can actually find it

1019
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,200
Just scroll down until you see ten dollars sierra. Nope. There we go

1020
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,320
No, I did answer this one. Yeah

1021
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,160
I think there is virtue in doing it without meds

1022
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:42,400
And I think there's virtue in having humility and awareness to take meds if you need them rather than trying the same thing

1023
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,040
That doesn't work

1024
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:43,520
Yeah

1025
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,080
So like if you can build positive habits such that you don't need the medication you should do that

1026
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,480
If you do need the medication, then that's also fine, right?

1027
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:57,360
Yep. Yeah, I completely agree. That's what I said. See this was my take and you didn't even let me fucking get it out

1028
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,280
Because you just raged out when I said there is virtue doing it without meds

1029
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,440
I was gonna say the other half of it and you just fucking lost it. Listen. I all I did was roll my eyes

1030
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,120
You're the one who reacted

1031
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,120
No, you fuck

1032
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,520
That's what happened

1033
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,000
Maybe he'll do it if you add a dev beg email

1034
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,680
You fucks

1035
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,080
You fucks

1036
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,460
Yeah, actually i'll do it before we start even though it's been like an hour jesus

1037
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,280
So

1038
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,080
It's all good holtonator, you know what I think we both might have read it

1039
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:50,480
And then like didn't like totally respond to it out loud. Maybe yeah. Thank you for the thank you for all the donations today

1040
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,160
Um

1041
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,920
Probably you haven't tried building positive habits. Oh, I absolutely have star hawks. I built a here's the thing

1042
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:02,400
I've built a ton of positive habits over the years my habits like 10 years ago were fucking

1043
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,400
I actually can confirm that dev actually has a lot of positive habits

1044
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,440
Wrong artemis, but hey, hey artemis, too

1045
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,760
Yeah, okay

1046
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,360
So let's let's get on the road on the road

1047
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,560
On the road again, that's okay. You have a different argument in the chat

1048
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,400
Okay

1049
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,200
Well, goodbye partial goodbye chat because now you're small and I can't read you

1050
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,040
Pop it out make a big I don't need to see the rest of the screen. I want to see what's going on here

1051
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,560
Why shut up?

1052
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,680
so

1053
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,720
Here's the p.o box as always actually when we move the p.o box is up in july

1054
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,280
Should we just like keep it keep it here for three months where you move it?

1055
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,600
I'm, not driving six hours to check on a p.o box. No, of course, of course, but like well

1056
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,920
But we'll probably come back to visit at some point

1057
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,320
My parents so we'll just check it on the way back like once or twice no

1058
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,400
I can't close it. You already paid for it. They send packages

1059

Here's the p.o box, by the way, send your packages to this this address and also donate to the channel tomorrow

1060
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
I really do appreciate it you were saying

1061
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,880
I was saying that just make sure to tell everyone not to send stuff. Are you abusing my fucking?

01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,000

01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,500
I saw your hello message. Nova dev was just going on a long rant so I couldn't respond

1069
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,800
Try and get the op box redirect, is that a thing?

1070
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,600
Yeah, you honestly

1071
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,600
Shortly before we should just ask

1072
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,400
If we can get them redirected to somewhere else

1073
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,720
Uh, oh

1074
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:07,040
Yeah, because I mean I can just read I can like get another p.o box redirected to where we go. Yeah, I mean it's possible

1075
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,560
Yeah, well, I mean if we're getting it redirected

1076
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,120
We could probably get it redirected to our actual address and then like set up a p.o box there. Um, yes

1077
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,040
Thanks

1078
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,600
So

1079
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,500
God dev shut. No, shut up. I'm telling him

1080
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,900
Ah

1081
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,500
Sp elite for five dollars while dev's typing. That's why I said tds late

1082
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:57,620
You're not a sketcho about it, but you do just have the worst takes about him debate sticks about him though

1083
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,820
He's literally an orange he's literally orange

1084
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:12,100
Imagine if we got on the news today, I know I know dagoth I know

1085
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:22,260
Okay, hey honey bun five dollars from sp. I already read it. Oh, yeah while you were typing sure god

1086
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,140
Okay

1087
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,900
Let's get to the news

1088
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,900
That is a different thing

1089
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:34,580
That's also a fascist newsletter. Listen, it's for research. Don't fucking think anything too late. Don't do it

1090
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,460
Okay, let's go

1091
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,700
On to the articles for today

1092
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:46,580
Nintendo switch 2 will reportedly feature 120 hertz display. Oh, I sent this to you. Yeah

1093
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:52,340
New new details regarding hardware specs for the upcoming successor to the nintendo switch dubbed the switch 2 have been revealed

1094
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,660
The handheld will feature 120 hertz display

1095
01:17:54,660 --> 01:18:01,140
So that means that it can go that in handheld mode. It can go up to 120 frames per second, which is way well

1096
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,700
Most computers run between 20 30 and 60. Um

1097
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:13,140
Well, wasn't there more than 60 is kind of overkill frankly, wasn't there that research that you actually can't see over like 30 frames a second

1098
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:17,620
Yeah, that was all bullshit. Yeah, that was bullshit if you say so. Yeah, everyone says that but it's like

1099
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,700
Yeah

1100
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:26,260
Yeah, that's bullshit but this is happening hooray, yeah, wait is it gonna look like that no this is just a mock-up

1101
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:31,060
Yeah, uh, we're supposed to learn here's the thing people are saying that the switch will probably release next christmas

1102
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,380
Which means we'll probably learn about it sometime in the next few months

1103
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:38,020
So I want to switch I want to say that I was I think I found this on reddit

1104
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:41,540
And so I was reading the comments and he was a redditor. Yes

1105
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:46,180
so I was reading the comments and people were just like, oh man nintendo never puts out like

1106
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:51,000
Anything that's current gen it's always like like it's the power of the ps4

1107
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,500
That's been the case since gamecube. Yeah, I agree

1108
01:18:54,980 --> 01:19:01,860
However, everyone keeps forgetting that this is also a handheld console and it's primarily a handheld console

1109
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:06,900
So without having the power of a ps4 the handheld console is actually really fucking cool. Yeah

1110
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:14,120
Well this here's the thing. So the gamecube came out and the gamecube was roughly on par graphics wise with the ps2

1111
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,320
And the original xbox, yeah, they were pretty much all the same

1112
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,960
Yeah, um, and then the wii comes out and the wii was not much better than the gamecube

1113
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:27,080
So therefore it was one generation behind the ps3 and 360 which were about comparable

1114
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:34,760
Which is why the wii didn't get all the multi-platform games that ps3 and 360 did but what the wii did get

1115
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,760
It had the wii remote and it had the huge install base

1116
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:43,880
So people started putting out a bunch of cool things on it then when the wii u came out the wii u was

1117
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,960
About the strength of the ps3 and the 360. Yep

1118
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:53,880
So in the ps4 and the xbox, um, the xbox one came out they were again one generation ahead

1119
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,920
So the wii u got a few of those ps3 and pia and and 360 games

1120
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,360
It got a few of those initial entry level ps4 games

1121
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,400
But for the most part the ps4 outclassed the wii u right now the switch came out and the switch

1122
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,680
Seems to be more powerful more powerful than the wii u but not by much

1123
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,880
So nintendo has definitely said, you know what we're not going to go with better hardware

1124
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,920
We're going to go with other things that make the game

1125
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,720
The system that make the console unique

1126
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,880
So we the the wii remote was a success the wii u gamepad was not

1127
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,800
And the switch the the idea of having like the joy cons are basically just wii remotes

1128
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,520
But they're much better and the idea that it's both a uh, a handheld and a docked platform

1129
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,240
Is also pretty incredible. Yeah, right

1130
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,840
So and also like nintendo basically started

1131
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:46,440
A new era of handheld gaming because after the switch success that's when you saw the steam deck

1132
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,680
That's when you saw like the rog handheld

1133
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,640
That's when you saw like all these little handhelds were showing up because nintendo proved that oh you can actually have

1134
01:20:54,600 --> 01:21:00,280
A devoted portable gaming device that also docks with your tv so you can use it in both modes. Yep

1135
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,080
The switch was a massive success

1136
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,600
All right

1137
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,600
So I have a feeling

1138
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,680
because nintendo's kind of

1139
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,680
Nintendo has has had this

1140
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:16,040
Back and forth with like one generation has been a success one generation has been a failure pretty consistently now for a while

1141
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,720
If the switch 2 is just the same thing as the switch

1142
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:25,000
But with better graphics, it might not be a very big success might not that's fair. I'm gonna get it though

1143
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I like yeah, read the thingy

1144
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,880
Mark the cyborg. Hey mark mark. I didn't know

1145
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,880
All right, actually, I think I knew but I forgot that your girl from his x-ray girl, right?

1146
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,880
Yeah

1147
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:41,480
Um mark the cyborg low target fidelity spec means games which don't cost hundreds of millions to make

1148
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,640
Nintendo can be dumb, but their dev target philosophy is based. Yes, that's true

1149
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,320
The only issue is that like when the big multi-platform games come out

1150
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,040
They're always not on nintendo systems and that can be a problem, right?

1151
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,320
So like when like what's a big multi-platform game right now?

1152
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,880
Right now. Yeah

1153
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,440
Yeah, like if that's not is that even on console? Yeah, is it? Yep. It's on ps4 and xbox

1154
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,480
You mean ps5 ps5 and xbox?

1155
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,920
But it's not I don't know the kind of but it's not on switch. It's not on the switch

1156
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,960
Like before it was like the arkhams the arkham games, right? Those are big multi-platform games

1157
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:19,080
The arkham games are now on the switch. I believe yeah. Well, yeah, but they're like they're like 10 years old now

1158
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,600
Like when they first came out they weren't on nintendo's console, right? Yeah

1159
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:28,840
What's the deal with v and his audience seemingly having derangement syndrome towards you? Here's the thing quinn. Um, it's because

1160
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,760
V and his audience and I am critiquing v now, but we are friends and this is not me backstabbing him

1161
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,880
I've told him this to his face. We have our disagreements, but we are still good friends

1162
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,120
v

1163
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,920
V believes in some things that personally I think are wrong

1164
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,760
however

1165
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,400
He and his audience have actually built an echo chamber where they're not challenged

1166
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:54,760
And because i'm somebody who consistently shows up in his orbit and challenges him publicly

1167
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,720
Um, I think his audience really doesn't like that, right?

1168
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:03,180
They his audience have in their own way become the same snowflakes

1169
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,320
I hate I hate saying that because it but it is true the same snowflakes that like

1170
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:15,080
Left wing left wingers were you know, five ten years ago where they didn't accept any dissenting opinion. They didn't accept any sort of um

1171
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:21,240
of disagreement and they just get irrationally angry and attack the person who's making the um

1172
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,120
Who's making the opposite point? Yeah, the opposite point. Yeah, who's having either opinion?

1173
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:31,800
All right, a lot of right wingers are finding themselves in this sphere now now to arch's credit

1174
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:37,000
Arch is somebody whose audience definitely acts like v's but arch himself isn't like that

1175
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:43,080
Arch will actually accept other points of view and he'll like he'll he'll uh, wait does v not accept other points of view?

1176
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,680
um

1177
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,240
Like we well here's the thing. We have civil conversations about it for sure

1178
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:54,760
But they definitely don't don't really go anywhere the conversation with arch do the conversation with v don't don't really wow

1179
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,160
They have bash in his friend's life

1180
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,160
No, because we bashing it's not the same thing as bashing

1181
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:06,600
None of this means that I dislike v or anyway, okay. I'm just going i'm just saying let me see. Let me see

1182
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
You haven't missed anything else. I've been checking

1183
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,320
Yeah

1184
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,960
I pay attention to the chat unlike you v is good people

1185
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,960
I'm pretty far removed from his from this echo chamber aspect if it really exists, of course it exists

1186
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,680
Of course it exists. Hold on here. I'm gonna show you this. All right

1187
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,600
Here this is not articles we've gotten to the first shut up

1188
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,280
It's vee nova, it's the first one

1189
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,640
Okay, hold on

1190
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,680
Okay, here we go, yeah

1191
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,320
Got it. Okay, so

1192
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:53,160
An epistemic bubble is a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out perhaps accidentally so

1193
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,720
an epistemic bubble uh bubble is when

1194
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:04,360
Bubble is when like you believe in an idea x because everyone that you see around you also believes in idea x

1195
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,360
You go on social media. Your entire feed is just idea x you turn on the tv

1196
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:15,080
It's all idea x you just so idea y you don't believe in idea y because you're never exposed to it, right?

1197
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:23,020
And then an echo chamber is a social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited

1198
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:29,320
So an echo chamber is when everyone believes in idea x but as soon as you encounter idea y

1199
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,040
You don't actually deal with idea y

1200
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,160
You simply discredit the source that it came from, right?

1201
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:42,760
So if you were to walk up and say to the echo chamber say hey, this is idea y they don't actually

1202
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,520
um

1203
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:50,200
They don't actually debate with you over the merits of idea x versus idea y they say hey

1204
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:56,440
You're you're a bad faith person. Therefore. I won't even consider your idea or or oh

1205
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:01,240
That idea came from an institution that I don't like. Oh, that's obviously biased. We can't trust them

1206
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:07,080
It's attacking the it's attacking the source of the new knowledge because it doesn't fit with your current worldview, right?

1207
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,120
That's what's going on. Don't you do that sometimes? No, sure. No, okay

1208
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,000
Yeah

1209
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,360
In instances in which I have in the past i've tried not to do that and do that do that recently like here's the thing

1210
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,200
I don't like vosh at all

1211
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:25,240
I think all of his ideas are bad, but this idea is bad because vosh said it is a poor reason

1212
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,240
For it being a bad idea. Okay, right you have to have a reason outside of that

1213
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:36,680
Five dollars from arnimas i'm telling you yeah arnimas you fuck you came back for that

1214
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:43,080
Also lives in dev's walls and no walls no, it would not help because dev would like that too much fuck you

1215
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,080
I don't know what you're saying, but fuck you

1216
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,640
You do do that dev no, I don't so here's the thing like when someone says so

1217
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:54,600
To use the obvious example, we're not going to go down a rabbit hole right when someone says something positive about trump

1218
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:00,200
I don't be like that guy's a fucking right winger. He's obviously fucking like I can't trust him like no

1219
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,720
No, i'll be i'll say okay. I'll look at the evidence. Let's take a look at it. What does it say about trump?

1220
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:08,440
I'll read through it. This doesn't make sense. Okay, here's here's why I think this is wrong like it's not just

1221
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,160
Attacking the source of the information because you don't like the outcome

1222
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:17,480
It is actually examining what is there and saying oh the actual content itself doesn't hold up a scrutiny. That's the difference

1223
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,280
This is because people keep calling you bad faith, maybe you shouldn't be calling other hypocrites by adopting hypocrisy

1224
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:30,600
Oh, no, no, no, here's the thing. I will I will just spitefully be a hypocrite towards hypocrites until you fucking stop

1225
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,760
Simple as that

1226
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,800
Okay, cool. Let's go back. Nope end of conversation back to the switch 2. Yes

1227
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,800
exit

1228
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,800
Good boy

1229
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,960
You know what?

1230
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,800
Okay, so

1231
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,240
anyway

1232
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:54,920
Taiwan Taiwan's economic daily has reported a new rumor regarding the hardware specs for the nintendo switch 2

1233
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:01,020
The sources mentioned that the console makers ready to launch the new switch this year in 2024 as per market expectations

1234
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:04,000
However due to constraints such as global inflation

1235
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:09,100
The new product will retail for a hundred dollars more than the switch will be four hundred dollars to get it rather than three hundred dollars

1236
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:14,060
Which was the switch was three hundred dollars in 2017. There's been some inflation. Okay, that's just kind of how it is. Yeah

1237
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,100
Sfo entering his trolls remorse phase. No

1238
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,580
What the fuck? I don't regret any any of the trolling that I did before trolling is fun

1239
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,340
Uh, ethan largest ten dollars tbsw. You can't be the same way on certain things

1240
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,980
I've seen you not respond to points that seem valid when you'll respond to others

1241
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:31,340
Feels like you all both have his habits and degree, uh, no and here's why

1242
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:35,820
Um, there's just a practical reality of how many comments I can respond to right?

1243
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:41,260
There will always be good arguments that slip through the cracks because it's a random chatter or a random commoner

1244
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,420
And I can't read them all and I can't respond to them all right

1245
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:50,620
It's just that's just how it is. But like when i'm sitting across the table with v and we have real disagreements. All right

1246
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:57,260
He might send me certain certain points and i'll be like let's examine these. Okay, and okay

1247
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:01,420
Here's why I think this one's right. Here's why I think this one's wrong when I send v my points

1248
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:08,060
He tends to say I don't believe this because of the source that it comes from not because of what's actually said in the argument

1249
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,820
That's the difference. Okay

1250
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:12,940
And again, none of this is a slight against v. All right

1251
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
We're still friends. We're still we're still good

1252
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:21,020
Uh five dollars even dozen walls. Thanks for explaining comes with echo chamber. Could you explain it again more slowly?

1253
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,740
I'm, not sure my poor wall brain can take it really

1254
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,740
Yeah

1255
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:30,620
Basically an echo chamber is not only a place in which you encounter one idea

1256
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:36,060
It's when you attack the it's it's when you attack the legitimacy of other ideas rather than actually dealing with them

1257
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,380
Okay, so

1258
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:48,060
Here's the specs of the switch 2 the nvidia t2 t 239 processor. What is that?

1259
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:50,060
Oh

1260
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:54,940
It's always gonna say oh, yeah, it's it writes a tegra. Yeah, because tegras are like they're they're uh, they're tablet chips

1261
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,260
Okay, it makes sense

1262
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,140
um

1263
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,540
Eight gigabytes of memory. That's that's not very much

1264
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,620
like

1265
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:06,060
Computers have 32 64 128 gigabytes memory now. Like why does that only have eight?

1266
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,100
64 gigabytes of internal storage

1267
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:15,340
This seems like even for like a switch like this is what you'd expect a tablet from 10 years ago to have even for us

1268
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,780
Like hold on

1269
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:21,260
Well, maybe they fucked themselves over already that is not true apples ghost

1270
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:27,260
You are saying inaccurate things about me and kind of proving my point what i'm saying. Okay, hold on switch

1271
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,260
Switch ram

1272
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:35,340
Okay, the switch has four gigabytes of ddr4 ram

1273
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:41,660
This one has eight switch internal storage

1274
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,620
So

1275
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:51,980
32 gigs that's not 64. So it is an improvement but like I would have expected maybe 16 gigs of memory

1276
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:54,540
maybe a terabyte of storage like

1277
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:59,580
Considering how big games you're getting nowadays. Yeah, it seems like not. Yeah. Yeah

1278
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,460
My pc has 128 gigs of ram

1279
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:08,300
Yeah, like all my pcs have 64 gigabytes of ram and 64 is more than enough for almost everything you have to do nowadays, right?

1280
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,980
um

1281
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:12,780
My the one that I buy next will have 128. Yeah

1282
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,300
Um

1283
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:17,500
like it just

1284
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
These are phone specs. Yeah, like

1285
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,380
I was calling you condescending

1286
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:27,660
Well do it again in a super chat

1287
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,540
Yeah, this is not enough

1288
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:38,460
I think I think the chat's agreeing like this is not enough dude. Well, I guess nintendo is just following its pattern

1289
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:44,940
Maybe one good console one bad. Maybe yeah, I mean like like I have a fairphone four

1290
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,420
Fairphone four specs

1291
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:56,700
Display yeah, yeah. Yeah

1292
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:01,260
Memory 128 gigabytes six gigabytes of ram

1293
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,100
Um

1294
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:08,860
No, no, this is um, six gigabytes of ram and internal storage of 128. So like my phone has more

1295
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:12,060
More internal storage and roughly the same amount of ram. Yeah, like

1296
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,660
Well nintendo's dumb

1297
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,180
This is this like

1298
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,500
I understand making an underpowered system. Yeah

1299
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:26,060
To put it out at a lower price. Yeah and work in other interesting things instead. Yep. I understand that. Yes

1300
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:28,460
Even for that even for that this is too low

1301
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:33,180
Like I think this needs to be 16 or 32 megs and this has got to be like

1302
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,060
10 times the storage. Yeah, like it's this ain't working man. This ain't working. Nope

1303
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:41,660
Do you believe is what he does because he and his family lived under

1304
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,460
Costco or I can't I can't pronounce his guy's name. I know who he is though

1305
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:48,780
And knows how bad socialism can get that's all true cjr like I agree with you, right?

1306
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:51,980
But this is why like this is why i've been telling him he hasn't accepted this logic

1307
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:56,220
But i've been telling him this whole time the difference is between our societies, right?

1308
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:01,900
He lives in a low trust society and you know, the the liberal capitalist democratic west

1309
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:04,460
Is not a low trust society

1310
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,620
That's the issue, right?

1311
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:12,380
Which is why they're different he keeps falling back and making the joke about it's like a race thing or like an ethnicity thing

1312
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,420
It's not

1313
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:15,420
It's it's it's a cultural thing for sure

1314
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:19,420
Ernest fowl five dollars common in ten cuck at hell. Thanks, man

1315
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,140
You fucker, uh

1316
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,380
Jiggy calzone five dollars dev in your echo chamber comment

1317
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:28,220
One thing that concerns me is seeing right wing forms slide into the same tree to spiral destroy the left of course

1318
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:31,340
Yeah, it's gonna happen. It's it's not possible for it to stop it at this point

1319
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:33,420
The right wing is gonna go insane. Of course they will

1320
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:39,740
The right wing will cobble itself into a fucking rampaging monster that'll just consume itself from the inside out just like the left did

1321
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:44,140
Read brian's comment. No, not brian's. Where did it go? I lost it

1322
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:51,340
Shit there it is. Nope, which one x that one

1323
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:58,860
Zero consumer the psi only has 16 gigs of ram ps4 had eight gigs of ram. Yeah. Okay. Well, then maybe it just needs 16

1324
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:01,420
Okay

1325
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:09,580
Okay, let's move on because this is coming out actually they've been saying there's gonna be a nintendo switch probably in january february

1326
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:15,100
What are you doing scratching everything you're not supposed to crack don't complain about me cracking my knuckles

1327
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,180
You're scratching your whole fucking body. Get out of here

1328
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:20,140
I forgot to moisturize last night. It's not my fault

1329
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,900
Lol at dev thinking we still live in a high trust society

1330
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:30,060
You know what dude if you actually think we don't go the fuck outside you've been on twitter too long

1331
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,460
Article 2

1332
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:41,180
Chilling moment brother carries his 18 year old sister's severed head to a police station and a sack

1333
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:45,900
After decapitating her for trying to marry against her family's wishes in india

1334
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:48,780
Oh

1335
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:54,540
My god really sad. Why do you always have sad articles? There's actually a lot of sad articles today to get used to it. No

1336
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:59,660
Twenty dollars from terrace chevenko. Thank you. Switch doesn't have to have 200 google chrome tabs

1337
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:06,780
And open and watching twitch youtube streams and monitors two and three while gaming that's all true. Yes, that's true

1338
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:10,860
Zamzy, thanks for becoming a member like your content recommending the divine comedy

1339
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:16,300
Translated by john cacardi for reading to me. It lays out a rational framework for divinity. I'll check it out. Thank you

1340
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:21,980
Right there

1341
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:24,780
Holstein for five dollars you and v are both right, but you're playing different games

1342
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:29,340
He wants to stop the left. You want to find what's true generally? Yes, and that is the difference between us

1343
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:34,620
I think that if your ideology is not aligned with the truth, it will inevitably fail

1344
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:39,340
Doesn't matter what whether you have power or not doesn't matter if you're on the left or the right or whatever

1345
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,980
Truth should be the goal

1346
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:43,900
So let's read it

1347
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:47,660
A brother beheaded his teenage sister for trying to marry against the family's wishes in india

1348
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:50,780
Before carrying her severed head towards a police station in a sack

1349
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,440
Ashifa an 80 year old woman who lived in barabanki

1350
01:35:56,380 --> 01:36:02,880
utar pradesh had eloped with her partner chand babu. They were both from the same village of mithwara

1351
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:08,620
However, her 22 year old brother riaz disliked the match and murdered her in a horrific honor killing

1352
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
Before carrying her severed head in a bag

1353
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:17,500
In chilling footage, he can be seen walking towards fate for police station carrying

1354
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:24,060
Jesus christ ashifa's head members of the public saw him with a blood-soaked bag reported to the police

1355
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:29,420
Young woman had wanted to marry a man of her choice, but her father abdul rashid and brother riaz were against it

1356
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:35,340
She what jesus christ fucking barbarians, dude

1357
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:39,740
I'm never visiting india ever. We should not have allowed india to be independent

1358
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,140
jesus deaf

1359
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:43,580
They're gonna do this with their freedom

1360
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:49,900
Okay, I want I want to rule them over with an iron fist until they until they lost all of their cultural diversity and values

1361
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,380
And made them completely copies of us

1362
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:56,380
Yeah, there's people in america who do shit like this. Yes, we should also rule over them, too

1363
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:02,540
You want to be american you can't say you want to rule over america as a canadian

1364
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:10,060
Hold on wait, what american like beheaded his fucking sister though. I bet you if you search up american beheadings that you will find something

1365
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:13,020
Okay, are they gonna be muslim immigrants? No

1366
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,940
Okay

1367
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,940
Let's see. Let's see

1368
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,680

Ashifa's partner was arrested and sent to jail where he and she was returned to the house her brother and father lived at

What do you want hold on questions that should be asked with those that want order is one on what terms two?

1394
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:11,100
Why do you want this above all and three? What will you do with it? That's true. I mean order is important

1395
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:15,180
But there's definitely times an order is stifling. That is definitely true. Thank you

1397
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,500

01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:36,780
Um student 15 allegedly attacks teacher while hallucinating on drugs leaving her with a severe brain injury

A 15 year old high school student allegedly punched a teacher in the head while hallucinating on drugs

01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,820
Holy fuck, dude. Yeah, it's wild

The kolarain high school student began acting distraught after he ingested an unknown drug in a classroom on thursday

1407
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:07,660
He allegedly punched the 60 the 60 year old teacher in the head and caused a severe brain injury requiring extensive medical treatment

1408
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:12,300
He also was accused of attacking another 15 year old student by grabbing him and pinching his neck

1409
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,420
Teacher this actually isn't locking memory for me. Oh

1410
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:19,580
Yeah, there was a teacher when I was in grade 12

1411
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:22,060
Uh, either 12 or 13

1412
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:27,500
We had grade 13 here for a while by the way guys. Um, you know, it was 13, I think um where like

1413
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:32,700
There's a teacher who was like very heavily pregnant like we're talking like eight months or something and she was still teaching right?

1414
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:34,860
And then one kid

1415
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,060
in class

1416
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,060
Like he started going wild

1417
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:42,060
And I think like people were teasing him and it was kind of funny but like he's he like lost it, right?

1418
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,220
So he picks up

1419
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:49,900
A desk. Oh, no, I think I think I've I think I might have told the story. I have a faint memory of this

1420
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,380
He picked up the desk and he wanted to like throw it

1421
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:56,220
um, and the teacher was like trying to stop him and like

1422
01:40:56,700 --> 01:41:01,900
It was me and like five other guys all just got up and it's like she clearly can't fucking handle this

1423
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:05,020
So we like we all like grabbed him, right?

1424
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:11,820
And like we were we were worried for a bit. The school was gonna be like students are fighting you're all but like nothing happened

1425
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,340
right, but

1426
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,900
I was like she couldn't fucking do anything dude. So like

1427
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:20,620
There's like five of us and we all just like grabbed this dude and we like we prevented him from throwing the desk

1428
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:26,140
And I was like listen, you gotta fucking calm down man. And what do you think like he didn't even get carried out

1429
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:27,980
by like

1430
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:31,260
Police or like like other teachers and nothing basically we calmed him down

1431
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:36,940
And then he stopped and he just went back to where he was sitting and we just kept going with class like crazy

1432
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:39,020
Nothing fucking happened man

1433
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:44,700
You and dave have these like crazy school stories I always hear crazy school stories from other people you want to know the most like

1434
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,780
Insane exciting thing that happened to me. There's two your music orgies

1435
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,500
No in in school

1436
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,660
jesus

1437
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:56,300
You guys spread to the music club where they all fucked each other one

1438
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:03,500
Yeah was an elementary school where a girl had like the like a giant bundle of like, uh, like pencils

1439
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:08,140
And stabbed another guy in the chest with them fucking hell. There's no blood or anything because it was like such a big

1440
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:09,820
like

1441
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:11,340
Mound of stuff

1442
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,260
That like nothing actually happened like he was hurt a bit

1443
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:16,380
But like there was no like it was not as bad as it would have been with just a single pencil

1444
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:16,700
Yep

1445
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:20,460
The other one was also an elementary school where me and a whole bunch of the guys got on a rock fight

1446
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:23,980
And I was the only one who actually had good aim. So I hit a guy in the eye. Oh, dude

1447
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:28,780
No, he was fine. The worst part was that he was my neighbor. Naomi had the tutor up approve her. Yep

1448
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,820
Yep, because this one time in band camp

1449
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:36,220
Apparently she's actually really mad that people keep quoting at her whenever they see her

1450
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:39,900
Like she's well, well like she was she was like like 19 or something

1451
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:42,300
When you came in that movie and now she's like walking around with her kids

1452
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:46,140
Yeah, and people interrupt her and like say it. Yeah, and she's just like the whole thing

1453
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:49,980
Yes, the whole the whole thing and they're like, she's like, please stop. I have my kids with me like you need to stop

1454
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:54,860
You're only supposed to say the save for work version in front of the children. Jesus

1455
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:57,100
Okay

1456
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,100
Oh, let's see. I'll just scroll back up a little bit

1457
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,700
Okay

1458
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:05,260
Five dollars from our most foul dev that is your subjective opinion of the things I bring you your conclusions are wrong on many outcomes

1459
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:07,420
Looking predicted hillary would win

1460
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:11,020
Did you predict that? I don't remember I might have way back in the day

1461
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:17,180
I mean, yes, i've been wrong before. Yeah, of course. Not everyone is 100 but the issue ultimately

1462
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:19,020
is that like

1463
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:21,020
okay, you and I have had this conversation but like

1464
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:23,420
If you say something with no proof

1465
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:27,340
And then in the future proof comes out

1466
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:34,140
That actually does prove what you were saying initially, but you had no proof before that doesn't actually make you retroactively, right?

1467
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,780
It means before you were guessing

1468
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:43,980
And yet you guessed correctly, but you didn't have a reason to think that though. That's and like that's that's just

1469
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,140
rationality

1470
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:51,100
You know like you you can you can guess things and have that guess end up being correct

1471
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,500
That doesn't mean that you had a good reason to guess it before

1472
01:43:54,380 --> 01:44:00,220
Because you're always going to forget due to due to selective bias all the times when you guessed and you were wrong, right?

1473
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:02,220
Okay

1474
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:04,140
That's why I always say hey

1475
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:09,020
Wait for court wait for documents to come out wait like wait for the ruling wait for if there's if there's indictments coming

1476
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,420
Wait, wait, you read the indictments like always say wait for these things, man

1477
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:19,340
Uh five dollars from holtzner more proof that men are stronger also the brain injury is probably from her being a woman. Oh my god

1478
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:25,420
Uh five dollars, uh butters, thank you working retail in california is definitely the words of trust in the high trust society

1479
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:31,260
Nine percent people do wait in line and buy the product. Yeah. Also california is like a uniquely degenerate place in the west for sure

1480
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:38,460
Now five dollars in donovan gill. Thank you. There's a recent beheading look up taylor shabazzness. Let's see

1481
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:44,300
Word of shad theory. Nope. Nope, go back one

1482
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,420
Taylor shabazz

1483
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:49,420
Gets life without

1484
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:51,660
Killing and dismembering her ex-boyfriend. Oh

1485
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:52,940
Oh

1486
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,540
See

1487
01:44:54,620 --> 01:45:00,700
People do fucked up shit. Let's see wisconsin woman gets life without coral for killing him and swimming her ex-boyfriend fucking wild, dude

1488
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:05,180
Yeah, but see this is a different before it was like muslim honor killing. It was part of their culture

1489
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:09,180
This is just this is just indian. We don't even know this is just crazy femoid

1490
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:20,140
Wait, hold on are you defending crazy femoids now i'm defending you're obviously attempting to make fucking point with bad take

1491
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:22,300
Okay

1492
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:27,580
Hey, i've been looking for a while i'm gonna say hi. Thanks rana. Thanks, man. Love y'all

Thanks, dude. I really appreciate the support. He's not going to uh, but I have been hold on. What do you mean?

1495
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:40,940
That's the whole point of the vibe is I have been um blonde two dollars artemis and the methods rationality dev is fat

1496
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,940
Thanks, um

1497
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:46,460
Uh, you know that it could be five dollars. Thank you

1498
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:50,540
All right dev say I want to debate a point of yours or another what terms and criteria to show you this person is being

1499
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,620
honest and legitimate what's the thing like

1500
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:57,500
I'm, i'm not saying that v or even as fans are being dishonest

1501
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,220
the issue is that they don't have like

1502
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:02,860
proper thinking methods

1503
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:09,180
They don't have good thought no, no, no, no, it's not the thoughts that are bad. It's the

1504
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:12,940
It's the methods by which they come to their conclusions

1505
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:14,300
Like

1506
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:19,180
Can't think right ergo bad. No like like rationality is definitely an art form

1507
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:27,340
Like you have to understand like what makes a thought like grounded in reason and what doesn't right like good thoughts good bad thoughts

1508
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:32,000
No, not good. I'm not talking about good or bad. I'm talking about reasonable versus unreasonable

1509
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:35,100
You fuck I know

1510
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:40,780
Okay

1511
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:43,180
Ten dollars arnold's foul. All right

1512
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:49,900
I'll pause it an idea for ten dollars. Thank you conservative bedrock world views are more capable of predicting outcomes in current events than liberal world

1513
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:55,260
Views dev is bad at predicting outcomes of current events. Okay, so artemis if that's what you say

1514
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:57,820
when I say for example

1515
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:01,680
It looks like based on the evidence provided

1516
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:08,320
There is a decent chance that trump is going to be convicted in the documents case specifically

1517
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,400
Is that in your opinion a good or bad prediction

1518
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,760
Assuming that you've read the documents indictment

1519
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,280
What do you think

1520
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,720
Um, i'm giving him the chance

1521

Holds there for five dollars. The difference is naomi honor killings are insubstantiated in their culture

1533
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,560
While random killings in the us are apparent freak things, you know what I will actually give that to you holsonator

1534
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,720
That's what I said. You just got mad at it

Because you said it in a worse way. Yeah, I said insane femoid

1536
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,560
Because most femoids aren't insane. What's the problem naomi?

1537
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:26,400
Oh, are you saying we are are they are they insane naomi? What do you say?

1538
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,480

01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:35,520
What are you saying? That's what i'm saying. Okay, let's let's read this one, I guess

1541
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,040
Let's see a wisconsin woman was remembering a former boyfriend scouting his body parts of various locations was sentenced to life in prison

1542
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,320

1543
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,520
taylor shop

1544
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:50,560
Wait sha business. What a last name 25 very 2020 of shad therian. See I was right bad prediction

1545
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,640
I can predict the future. Oh

1546
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,240
okay, so

1547
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,440
you think

1548
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,440
So so artemis, what do you think?

1549
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,400
Will come out of the documents case for trump

1550
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:06,960
What what what is your prediction regarding specifically the trump documents case? Give me give it to me. Let's get it on

1551
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:10,560
On fucking camera on recording right now

1552
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,920
So so we both have our predictions down. We'll see where it goes. Okay?

1553
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:20,500
Because I think I think there's like a decent chance. He will get fucked with this indictment

1554
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:22,660
Okay

1555
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:24,660
Okay

1556
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:29,620
Silence was definitely, you know, she uh, pleaded not guilty and I could present mental disease or defect

1557
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:31,620
But the jury found she wasn't mentally ill

1558
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,540
Yeah, she huh?

1559
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:38,740
She smoked meth. Oh, dude, i'm gonna fucking behead you it turns out being on meth in the basement of therian's mother green

1560
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:40,100
But it's okay

1561
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:44,980
Strangled decapitated dismembered left the party branch throughout the house in a vehicle wild dude

1562
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:47,220
wild

1563
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:50,100
No, they are that's why I support a cab, what do you mean

1564
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,460
What do you mean by that hold center?

1565
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:56,740
No, no, they are that's why I support a cab. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know

1566
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:00,180
Anyway, yeah

1567
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:05,700
Yep, she discovered her son's head in a bucket in the basement. Oh my god. Imagine fucking discovering your son's head in a bucket

1568
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:08,740
Oh jesus

1569
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:14,420
No fight someone in court hold on she attacked her attorney why

1570
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:15,860
Why

1571
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:18,340
She was sentenced. Okay. She was sentenced

1572
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:23,940
And she attacked her attorney. Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I don't want to spend my life in jail

1573
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:27,060
I want to attack you because you said you I wouldn't

1574
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,220
That's yeah, that's fucking insane dude

1575
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:36,340
Blonde five dollars. I said you weren't reading him. So I came to youtube. I was answering answering my question

1576
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:38,420
Also, why don't you pretend that you like me?

1577
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:43,780
Listen I appreciate the donations but blonde because you are a gaming stream viewer

1578
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:46,740
I do like you of course

1579
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:49,380
Remember the time that name we defended this woman like two minutes ago. Yeah, I do

1580
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:55,460
I did not defend her. I was defending life from doves bad takes

1581
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:58,020
Okay, no

1582
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:00,100
No, we're still on this article. Yeah, jesus

1583
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:08,740
This guy this 15 year old got high in unknown drug punched the 60 year old teacher gave her a severe medical injury. She was uh,

1584
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:13,860
Taken to the university of cincinnati medical center where she had her skull cap removed to prevent damage from swelling. Yep

1585
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:20,260
The police then found the alleged attacker in the school's career center lobby who was apparently hallucinating had a self-inflicted head wound. Oh my god

1586
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:23,860
He's he's fucking losing it dude

1587
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:28,660
He was taken to the hospital and then to hamilton county juvenile detention center on a charge of felonious assault

1588
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:32,100
And the school was investigating the incident honestly to be honest

1589
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:36,020
But 15 year old is on drugs that hard they probably should be in juvie. So that's yeah

1590
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:42,740
There's no current threat to the school community it seems to be like an isolated thing. Yeah, but still like

1591
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:47,620
The fuck are you doing kid making bad life decisions the fuck is wrong with you?

1592
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:51,860
Jesus you already read that. Yeah, i'm just looking up not allowed

1593
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,180
Okay

1594
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:56,740
teen arrested in federal terrorism probe

1595
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,620
What? Okay

1596
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:02,020
This guy I don't know if this is in the article. I did look it up

1597
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:08,340
This guy is the son of a prominent attorney. Okay, um leaders from the city and federal law enforcement on monday

1598
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,260
Announced that a 17 year old residence

1599
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:14,360
And that's the 17 year old resident of western delhi has been arrested and charged a part of federal federal terrorism investigation

1600
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:21,400
The juvenile was taken into custody by fbi swat officers at his residence in the winefield section of philadelphia

1601
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:29,700
Um investigation led by fbi joint terrorism task force which includes detective details from president from philadelphia police department is active and ongoing, okay

1602
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:36,180
I think me too dev even though I watch more dave solo streams because I like watching entertaining people. Fuck you goes in your band

1603
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:37,940
Uh

1604
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:39,140
Rsm 10

1605
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:41,140
It will evaporate into the ether

1606
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:44,420
If trump doesn't win outright due to how poorly the prosecution has been ran

1607
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:48,740
He will appeal until he wins in november and then the case will be dropped after okay, so rms actually here

1608
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:52,580
I'll agree with you on this partially, right if trump wins the election

1609
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:57,620
In november, I think these cases will go nowhere. I agree with you on that

1610
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:00,660
If trump loses the election in november

1611
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:05,000
I do think he will probably um, he will probably be prosecuted

1612
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,000
He'll probably be

1613
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,360
He's not going to win the documents case, I think all right

1614
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:17,160
the other cases like you mentioned artemis file the georgia rico case is now in question because they discovered some weird shit happening with one of

1615
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,280
the uh

1616
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:21,640
With one of people they brought onto it. So that's true. That seems to be true as far as I can tell

1617
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:27,880
So maybe the georgia rico case falls apart possibly right the documents case. It seems to be dead to rights

1618
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:32,840
But if trump wins in november, it might not matter at all, right?

1619
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,640
So i'm saying if trump loses

1620
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:42,360
The election in 2024. He probably also loses in the documents case. That's my prediction. Okay?

1621
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,480
Let's get it on record

1622
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:50,840
Okay, so

1623
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:56,600
the district attorney's office has charged the juvenile with weapons of mass destruction criminal conspiracy arson causing arson catastrophe attempt to

1624
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,760
To commit criminal mischief possession of instrument of a crime and recklessly endangering another person

1625
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:08,440
Okay, listen, I know mischief is like an actual legal term but attempt to commit criminal mischief is just really really funny. Yep. I know

1626
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:15,640
The work of the fbi joint terrorism task force potentially thwarted a catastrophic terrorist attack in the name of preferred

1627
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:20,940
Ideology that in no way shape or form represents the beliefs of the overall majority of peace seeking people of faith including muslims

1628
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:26,440
You're reading this too fast. This was a 17 year old. It's not going to be completely said in this article

1629
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,280
This is a 17 year old son of a muslim immigrant who is a lawyer

1630
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:35,400
Who got radicalized probably online and he joined some fucking terrorist group. Jesus

1631
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:39,480
How about just don't be radicalized guys

1632
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,480
Just don't do it

1633
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:44,360
Yeah

1634
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,120
Damn, wow

1635
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:51,080
Honestly that poor dad. Yeah, like to like move. Well, maybe well, maybe he's also like a fucking extremist

1636
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:55,560
Well, like maybe but like listen, let's just go on the assumption that he's not right

1637
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:02,120
Can you imagine like immigrating to a better like a better country like at least that you think is a better country and like

1638
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:06,520
Actually being able to like achieve your dreams of having a good job in said country

1639
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:12,040
Right and then having your kid just like ruin your image and reputation forever

1640
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,400
that's just that's just

1641
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:22,360
Unfortunate like that is just you would probably feel like an utter failure of a parent at that point in time

1642
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:24,840
Yeah, that just sucks

1643
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:32,280
Apples ghost says obama struggled to win at 34 percent ruling about 39. Yeah, here's the thing polling is often right

1644
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:35,880
But every once in a while it's wrong like polling was wrong with trump 2016, right?

1645
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,120
The polls had hillary to win hillary did not win

1646
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:42,680
Um, but generally polls are pretty correct. I think biden's kind of screwed. Yeah

1647
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:45,720
Armors file five dollars

1648
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:51,080
Um free to the poisonous tree all current indictments have been tainted by the same bad actor working together as one gets thrown out

1649
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,160
The rest well, I don't know about that

1650
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:59,640
I'm, not sure you're using through the poisonous tree correctly because they are coming from different different offices different people like different states

1651
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:03,160
I don't know if if what you're saying is completely true there artemis

1652
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:05,880
But thank you for all the donations do

1653
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:06,920
okay, so

1654
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:11,820
The juvenile is alleged to have been in contact with individuals and groups designated by the u.s. State department as global terrorists

1655
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:16,520
including katabat al tawhid while jihad

1656
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:21,640
Who is believed to primarily operate in syria's responsible for attacks including the deadly 2017 attack on st

1657
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:26,780
Petersburg russia metro and the 2016 suicide car bombing of the chinese embassy in bishkek kurzakstan

1658
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,920
What is this kid doing fucking getting linked up with these guys

1659
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:37,160
Making bad life decisions self-radicalization by young people via the internet is a threat to all families

1660
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:42,920
Yep, so guys you should instead join the cult of dev where you send me all your money

1661
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:46,600
You get radicalized, but you yeah

1662
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,600
Yeah

1663
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:53,320
Uh real holes in their five dollars look at how the media takes care to say this doesn't represent all of them

1664
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:57,480
Imagine if he was a conservative would they take the same care? Of course, they wouldn't if it's like a right-winger

1665
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:02,360
They wouldn't say they're obviously not all right wingers. Like it is like their their bias is kind of disgusting

1666
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:05,160
Even though they should be saying it. They should be saying yeah. Yeah

1667
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,860
What's next?

1668
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:13,080
Pennsylvania toddler allegedly killed by dad's girlfriend who fed her acetone batteries and a screw

1669
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:15,880
Oh, this is the one you were looking at earlier and I just kind of cried

1670
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:23,160
Guys, listen, she looks like a fucking baby, too. This is just she's 20. Yeah, I know but like

1671
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:27,960
This is just fucked up. Why are there so many fucked up articles today? This is sad

1672
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:37,000
A pennsylvania woman is accused of fatally poisoning her boyfriend's 18 month old daughter by feeding her batteries screws and nail polish remover

1673
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:41,560
After she researched the harmful effects the items could have on a child before the killing

1674
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,680
Well, I'll just do it in incognito mode dude, it'll be fine

1675
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,920
This is why you go to the library and search up stuff

1676
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,200
Oh

1677
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:58,840
Alicia owens 20 was arrested thursday for the suspected homicide of iris rita alfera

1678
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:03,160
After an autopsy determined the child died due to fatal levels of acetone in her blood

1679
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:10,200
Owens had been living with iris's father bailey jacoby when he left the house to go to the store on june 5th, 2023

1680
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:15,240
Jacoby who had visitation rights with iris then received a call from owen saying something was wrong with his daughter

1681
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:20,540
He rushed to the newcastle home to find his baby girl unresponsive and quickly called 9-1-1

1682
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:27,080
Can you imagine just going to the store to get stuff and coming home and your kids like dead

1683
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,680
Holy shit, that's really fucking sad. Yep

1684
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:38,200
She was rushed to umpc jamison hospital in newcastle, pennsylvania for treatment

1685
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:43,020
But she was later airlifted one roughly one hour away to upmc children's hospital in pittsburgh

1686
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,560
She died four days later due to organ failure

1687
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:51,960
Iris lived with her mother emily alfera and her grandparents while her father jacoby had visitation rights

1688
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:54,760
owen said that police that

1689
01:58:54,760 --> 01:59:00,040
Owen told owens told the police the girl had hit her head after she cramped up and fell off her bed

1690
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:06,840
Autopsy showed that iris had ingested numerous water beads along with a button-shaped batteries and a metal screw

1691
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:10,280
Months before she died. Oh my god months before she died

1692
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,320
A search of uh, are you okay now?

1693
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:22,200
A search of owen's phone revealed she had been looking up information on household products that could cause a child serious harm or death

1694
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:26,840
Including water beads batteries and nail polish jesus fucking christ, dude

1695
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,160
Jesus fucking christ, dude

1696
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:33,880
Like the fact that it's months ago shows this was just premeditated too like

1697
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:36,600
She's she's fucked

1698
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,840
Like she's going to to giga jail

1699
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:46,280
She also searched beauty products that are poisonous to kids and medications leading to cause accidental poisoning deaths in children

1700
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:49,720
Holy shit, dude

1701
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,520
Yep, the findings on her phone were a crucial piece of evidence against her

1702
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:00,760
Okay, listen, I know I say I don't like kids all the time and listen like I don't

1703
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:06,360
But like it is always really sad when a kid like that young

1704
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:12,440
Dies like like situation like in situations like this because like they didn't even get the chance to live

1705
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:16,840
this is the mother and the child and then the father had visitation and then

1706
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:20,840
This was this was the new girlfriend of the father. Holy shit

1707
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:26,440
It honestly if she ever got out of jail and I was that dad I would straight up murder

1708
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:28,200
100

1709
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:31,800
So there was uh, there was no evidence linking the father to the death at all

1710
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:35,320
There's nothing throughout the investigation to show that he had any knowledge or involvement what happened to the baby

1711
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:37,320
He was questioned multiple times was cooperative

1712
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,400
I actually think you know what? I actually think that's true

1713
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:42,760
I think in this case, it was just like some really fucked up

1714
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:48,440
Young woman who was just like I want to spend time with this baby dad with this with this baby's daddy

1715
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:53,640
Yeah, but I don't want him to actually be a daddy so i'm just gonna make him be mine fucking hell man

1716
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:57,160
Fuck that's what's next. That's really fucking sad

1717
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:03,960
Irs identifies agent shot and killed during training exercise. Oops. That's a big oops

1718
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:09,480
An irs special agent was killed during an accidental shooting by another agent during a training exercise thursday

1719
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,400
wait

1720
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:14,040
An irs special agent. Yeah irs has agents

1721
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:16,360
For

1722
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:17,880
Yeah for what?

1723
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:22,840
Well, they're the they're the taxes guys, right? Yeah, I know. Yeah. Well if you don't pay your taxes, they come and raid you

1724
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:28,040
With special agents specifically for the irs. I didn't know that I thought they just used like cops

1725
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:34,200
Before you have some police involvement. Yeah, but like they have their own enforcement arm too. Really? Yeah. Holy shit pretty much every

1726
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:37,080
every like

1727
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:41,320
Even in canada, it's the same way like every branch of government has its own like enforcement arm

1728
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:46,920
So like that's why like park rangers. No, okay. They they have the same some of the same enforcement powers as police do

1729
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,160
Yes, the park rangers are different

1730
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:56,920
A statement released thursday fbi officials confirmed that they are investigating the death of an irs special agent. They're not share further details

1731
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:00,600
significant tragedy for the agents involved the agency their families

1732
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:08,760
Just really sad to see the federal bureau of prison says investigating a shooting incident at the federal correctional institute institutional phoenix firing range

1733
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:13,160
So I know people were people on twitter were saying like oh my god, dude

1734
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:15,480
They obviously killed one of their own because they're covering something up

1735
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:21,400
It could also just be like an accident. This is one. This is probably gonna be just hey, uh,

1736
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:26,920
Make sure you guys follow all the safety rules of the shooting range and then people didn't follow the safety rules of the shooting range

1737
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,480
So that's the way it always is like this agent was the one who was going after like the big corpos

1738
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:35,080
Because government and they're shaking hands. So like I mean

1739
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:40,040
The irs identified the fallen agent space seven year old special agent patrick bauer. What did he do?

1740
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:44,200
You know, what's funny is that I would have believed that a few like like several years ago

1741
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:49,160
But after being in retail so long and realizing just how fucking stupid people are

1742
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:53,320
It's definitely just incompetence of a person that caused this. Yep

1743
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:07,640
Nothing about him anyway, yeah, you watch you go back and just like he was actually investigating big corporations. They took him out

1744
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:12,460
If it turns out that he was he was investigating george soros

1745
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:23,320
The u.s postal service has its own law enforcement branch too. I didn't I guess I just didn't think about that

1746
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:27,320
Okay

1747
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:31,640
Seven texas men filmed themselves gang raping two toddlers. Why?

1748
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,440
Why do we have to read these?

1749
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:40,840
Why can't you just find not so fucking sad articles, holy fucking shit today is the sad day guys

1750
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:50,360
Seven texas men filmed themselves gang raping two toddlers in the bathroom of a houston's galleria mall where the ringleader worked

1751
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:55,320
This is the this is these are the art. These are the sad articles today guy. Holy shit

1752
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:03,880
D then thanks for the three dollars man us education bar also has a raid team. Yep. Yep, they do. Um

1753
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:12,040
Horrifying videos have surfaced of a gang of at least seven men sexually abusing toddlers inside the restroom of a texas mall

1754
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:18,600
Arthur hector fernandez 29 years old a kiosk worker at the galleria mall in houston

1755
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,120
Is charged with assaulting the toddlers and posting the videos on time

1756
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:24,280
or online

1757
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:27,880
Oh my god, they were two years old. Oh my god

1758
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:33,000
Two friends of fernandez sometimes left their children to two year olds in his care

1759
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:35,240
While they worked in the mall

1760
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:37,240
Yeah, it was like broken right now guys

1761
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:45,320
The fbi says they launched a probe last month after the abuse videos posted on a private online forum were shared by the australian

1762
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,320
center to counter child exploitation

1763
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:50,680
wait

1764
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:55,640
Oh, so this was discovered because even though it happened in texas

1765
02:04:56,040 --> 02:05:01,320
It was first discovered by the australian center to counter child exploitation. So the australians found it. You okay?

1766
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,720
This is why I don't fucking read the news

1767
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:15,560
Yeah, the australians discovered it on the internet and then got the americans at volks that happen in america, okay, it'll be okay

1768
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:26,280
Each of the four videos shared with authorities reportedly showed a different assault and they take place in different rooms and locations including bathrooms

1769
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,880
at the mall

1770
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:30,040
Fernandez is the only suspect charged in the case so far

1771
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:32,920
It's unclear if the other is said to appear in the video has been identified by officials

1772
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:38,520
Police closed in on him using an open source image repository to search for the face of one of the children

1773
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,920
And then it matched it with social media images shared by one of the women

1774
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:50,060
When police showed the child's mom a sanitized image from the abuse materials the woman reportedly noticed a pair of bracelets owned by fernandez

1775
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,480
Police then saw those bracelets on the suspect's social media. So he worked at this mall here

1776
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:58,360
In houston

1777
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:00,200
Okay

1778
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,120
titanium says

1779
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:06,120
Hold on dev. How can you be so nonchalant about this? What the fuck? How can you laugh?

All right, I don't find this funny. Okay

1782
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:23,080
Also, uh from the other side of the spectrum here, uh titanium asks naomi. I legit don't understand how you're this sensitive

1783
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,720
You work in fucking customer service

Okay

1785
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,560
Do they get worse

1786
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:36,840
Is this the worst one or do they get worse? I don't know

1787
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:40,120
I just I knew when I was looking over today's articles

Are you okay? No, are you okay? Naomi?

1791
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:53,400
It's okay. Naomi

1792
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,640
The u.s. Army has a government branch. Well

1793
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:57,480
Well, yeah

1794
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:02,120
Aren't they part of the government? No, thanks to dollars, but no, thank you. Okay, stop abusing me

1795

02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,960
Okay

1797
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:18,120
Okay, let's let's continue

1798
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:24,680
Japanese apex legends players are being banned for hateful conduct after saying run

1799
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:33,000
Run bait run. Oh, no. Oh, no, it's bad. Do you want to know why you want to know what the word run is in japanese?

1807
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:59,240
Informing them of the reason behind their ban

Reddit user claimed the japanese player spoke their native language while playing the game and said nigero

1811
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:15,560
Which translates to run or get out of here?

1812
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:22,120
That's a stupid reason to ban people. Yeah, but they Jesus

1813
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:30,120
If it's their native language you can't ban them for that racist, yes you can no you can't

02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:34,120
Well in chinese nega means um

02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:24,860
Yep, they were banned for a week

1829
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:30,140
That's bullshit man. That actually is it's actually racist indonesian spanish have been banned while playing

1830
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:34,940
An indonesian player was banned in july for saying nigac which means no in english

1831
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:41,020
It's fucking ridiculous. That's actually racist. Spanish word for black is negro. Yeah

1832
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:42,540
also

1833
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:43,960
an ironic twist

1834
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:48,540
Octane a spanish-speaking hero in the game uses negro in his voice lines

1835
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:50,940
But if you say it as a spanish speaker yourself you get banned

1836
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:58,140
Jesus, yep, university of southern california professor was suspended for using is it? Yeah. Is this nigga?

1837
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:02,620
Change for the word

1838
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:09,180
Um, i've heard many Chinese people say it and they just go nigga. Yeah. Yeah, it goes. Yeah, that's good

1839
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:10,940
So that's how you pronounce it

1840
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:12,460
Yeah

1841
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:14,540
I mean I can just say the direct inward. No, you cannot

1842
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:23,580
Okay, how much money would it take for you to just drop a hard r and bomb how much money in private no on the stream

1843
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:25,900
Oh like a thousand dollars

1844
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:27,900
Maybe more

1845
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:31,100
You said a thousand I said maybe more okay guys

1846
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:37,820
We are at what's our current super chats no, no in one super chat, oh you can't

1847
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:41,900
Yeah, youtube doesn't let you I know the highest chat. You can actually super test 500. I know

1848
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:45,420
So if we get a thousand a thousand dollars with super chats today, you will say it no

1849
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:48,060
Yes, it has to be a thousand and one. No, you can't

1850
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:49,820
I know

1851
02:10:49,820 --> 02:10:51,820
You can't I know

1852
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:57,180
No, it has to be something you can actually get no. Yes. It does you asked my price and that's what it was

1853
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,300
Don't do it. Artemis. Don't do it

1854
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:06,620
Oh, yeah ningen ningen means human in japanese, yeah

02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:14,220
Nope, I I have decreed it will be a thousand but it will have to be in multiple super chats. No. Yes

02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:02,060
You you bought actually legitimately. How long ago was that? I don't remember this at all. It was like a year or two

1869
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:03,900
No fucking way

1870
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:09,180
No, no, no. Nope. Actually. No, I wasn't here too. It was I think it was more than that. No, I was it was before covid

02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:11,500
Yeah, so, okay. Yeah

1872
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:14,220
Listen, I forget that covid happened like in my brain

1873
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:18,300
I know it did but so last year was 2019. Yeah

1874
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,980

02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:46,220
You deserve to be in some of these fucking articles slit

02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:48,060
Can we see?

1880
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:50,460
Uh, the Naomi nudes are actually priced at a million

1881
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:54,460
Unless Naomi fails to fulfill her her inward contract then they will go out

1882
02:12:55,420 --> 02:12:57,420
This is why i'm gonna slit your throat while you're sleeping

1883
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:06,540
Okay, so stop is that one stretching yes, nope, should we continue on

1884
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:15,260
Wolverhampton grandmother's abusers have been caught by a hidden camera. Hey grandma

1885
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:23,500
Wait what two sisters caught four care workers abusing their 89 year old grandmother after hiding a camera in her bedroom

1886
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:26,700
Jesus oh they mean

1887
02:13:26,860 --> 02:13:31,740
Yeah, yeah, danielle hensey and her sister rebecca became suspicious after barrel wall's behavior changed

1888
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:34,620
And she began to get bruises on her face and wrists

1889
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:40,460
Like a scene from the hugely popular netflix drama fool me once they put a photo frame with a hidden camera in her room

1890
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:42,780
at a care home

1891
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:46,620
Four days of footage was enough to convict her attackers. Yep

1892
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:49,180
They caught the workers shouting and dementia

1893
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:51,900
Shouting and dementia suffer miss wall's face making fun of her

1894
02:13:52,220 --> 02:13:56,940
Holding her legs in the air and hitting her in the face of the pillow. Yeah, jesus fucking christ

1895
02:13:57,500 --> 02:14:02,780
Holy shit guys. This is a thing that happens a lot. I was gonna become the right about it

1896
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:05,420
oh

1897
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:07,980
Jesus holy shit, man. Yeah, like it's

1898
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:09,900
Yeah

1899
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:12,880
Old age homes make me upset. I'm a tonkara

1900
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:17,820
moral and dante a diffala danny ohan and bridget a

1901
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:21,180
Adian were jailed at the end of 2023 good

1902
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:23,820
fucking hell

1903
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:29,180
Sister saw their grandmother's regularly. So they quickly spotted her decline visited nan every day as this happened before lockdown

1904
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:32,380
Yep

1905
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:35,900
They're just doing like fucking assholes, man. Yeah a lot of like

1906
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:40,220
Like caretakers of people who suffer dementia are actually like

1907
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:46,540
Terrible people which is unfortunate. We totally live in a high trust society, right? This is happening in the uk

1908
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:47,580
All right

1909
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:48,300
No, seriously

1910
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:53,260
the uk has serious problems with immigrants like bringing in low trust immigrants like the uk has problems that um

1911
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:58,540
The uk and like continental europe has problems that america and canada do not have right now

1912
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:05,500
And to simply transplant american or canadian politics to europe is stupid because they're facing different issues than we are

1913
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:07,740
um

1914
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:10,780
It's the same type of camera millions of viewers have seen actress. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah

1915
02:15:11,980 --> 02:15:13,740
When danielle viewed the footage several days later

1916
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:16,700
She said it broke my heart the capture of the people who should have been carried for her most

1917
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:19,900
For her most mocking miss wall and pinching her face

1918
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:22,880
Much of the footage their grandmother was naked and confused

1919
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:27,660
So took the evidence to the care home managers the care quality commission and west midlands police

1920
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:31,580
Three of the four workers were from an agency and one was a permanent member of the staff

1921
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:33,180
Yep

1922
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:35,180
Damn, dude

1923
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:37,740
Fucking hell

1924
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:40,540
Dev reacts to this and not the children directly to all of it you fuck

1925
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:40,860
Okay

1926
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:47,260
I I want to point out that I think that dev has this habit of when i'm reacting really poorly to something that he acts

1927
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:52,060
More positive than he's necessarily feeling at the time. Yeah, and that happens a lot. Yeah

1928
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:57,260
Because you're having a rough time of it. So yeah, you know, you can just react poorly too. It's okay

1929
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:02,940
Eight care workers are charged for it with abusing miss wall, but only four of them are found guilty. All right

1930
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:04,300
What

1931
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:08,940
So these two were sentenced to four months in prison because the ill treatment and willful neglect

1932
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:12,140
These two were found there since six months and four months

1933
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:18,860
They should be charged for longer the fuck. It's the uk and they're saying oh, they're just they're black and innocent

1934
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:22,780
Fucking ridiculous, dude

1935
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:25,580
Okay

1936
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:29,900
The last of us knockoff game has been removed from the switch e shop. So look at this

1937
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:33,820
This is the last hope it's very clearly a last of us

1938
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:37,580
All right

1939
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:42,940
The game appeared on the storefront last week where it was quickly highlighted on social media being a knockoff of sony's the last of us

1940
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:46,540
And the game has been removed from the e-shop and trailers are being taken down by youtube and sony

1941
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:50,380
Uh, neither nintendo or sony commented on the matter

1942
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:55,420
So this is apparently the worst game ever. Okay. Can we see this video digital foundry?

1943
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:57,420
Okay

1944
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:01,180
Okay, let's see the video wow

1945
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:07,980
The last hope on nintendo switch is the worst game ever reviewed

1946
02:17:10,140 --> 02:17:12,140
Does look pretty shit

1947
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:16,060
Doesn't the switch have like an didn't you get all that like malware or whatever? Yeah

1948
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:23,180
The switch is a really bad like moderating system for like what games constitute as actual games on their shop

1949
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:27,580
So, let's see, yep

1950
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:34,780
This is the game guys, would you rather play this or the last of us the last of us

1951
02:17:38,140 --> 02:17:41,260
I'd rather watch bakar again than play this game deal

1952
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:45,980
Oh, can we just can we just not

1953
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:51,980
Like here's a comparison and it's like well they look the same don't they?

1954
02:17:53,340 --> 02:17:55,340
Jesus christ

1955
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:57,420
Yeah

1956
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:08,460
If I can find it we should try it no

1957
02:18:10,060 --> 02:18:12,060
No

1958
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:17,020
Yep, I mostly ignore shovelware infested digital storefronts and assume many of them are innocuous

1959
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:22,540
But you see something like this. It really pulls back the curtain the depravity festering within certain corners of the industry. Yeah. Yep. So

1960
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:24,300
Uh

1961
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:30,700
The game is developed by west connection limited and uh, the last hope dead zone survival is the most is their most blatant copy

1962
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:37,580
Another game so players who have purchased the last hope dead zone survival can still play the game on switch and still redownload it

1963
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:39,900
But if you try to find it, you can't buy it anymore

1964
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:45,340
Good. I kind of wish I had a copy of it god. Shut up. I'll try it. It looks shut up. Shut

1965
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,700
Up, really? It's a piece of lost media now

1966
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:54,960
What what what are you getting mad about you and your stupidity

1967
02:18:56,140 --> 02:19:03,660
I'm not stop playing super bad fucking shovelware games or wanting to that is not a good trait for any

1968
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:08,380
Sane person to have listen, it's still better than last was too. No, it's not

1969
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:11,740
I would rather play last of us too again 100

1970
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:17,100
This is the the thumbnail guys women will suffer diarrhea forever

1971
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:20,220
After osm pick caused a horror bowel injury

1972
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:25,340
And a weight loss drug made her made another vomit until her teeth fell out

1973
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:30,940
Okay, well that that makes sense but diarrhea forever. Yep

1974
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:35,180
Would you just have to wear like a diaper all the time? And here she is

1975
02:19:36,220 --> 02:19:39,900
Wow, she's how old is she she looks now she has built-in lube for anal

1976
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:42,940
Ew

1977
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:44,940
You

1978
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:49,740
Okay, okay

1979
02:19:49,740 --> 02:19:55,820
So a woman who will suffer diarrhea for the rest of her life after using osm pick is among dozens of patients

1980
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:01,120
Who are suing the maker of the blockbuster weight loss drug over claims that left them with crippling stomach paralysis?

1981
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:09,180
Novo, nordisk the maker of osm pick and wago v is facing lawsuits from patients across america

1982
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:13,900
Who say they experienced extreme side effects, which they were allegedly not worn about

1983
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:18,380
Thousands more patients have also come forward to claim

1984
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:23,420

02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:58,060
Which caused her to vomit so much her some of her teeth fell out. Jesus. That's a lot of vomiting

2030
02:23:50,300 --> 02:23:55,260
There were several there were several police officers that jumped him says james pence related to mike pence

Obviously who co-owns bar pm with chad wick who is chad wick is the guy

2033

02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:21,020
Pence says the police officer who ran into the bar told him that he swerved to miss a dog in the middle of south broadway

2038
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:26,860
Pence says he does have security camera footage of the crash though. He's not making it public at this time

2039
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:32,460
The police department did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment this morning. Okay. Well, hold on

2040
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:34,780
wait

2041
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:39,020
Pence who lives above the bar said he was getting ready to head to bed as two people down

2042
02:24:39,500 --> 02:24:43,680
Two people close up for the night suddenly felt the whole building shake and ran downstairs

2043
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:49,580
He came to find the police suv in his building and an officer demanding to see his id

2044
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:55,500
Why pence said he replied no, you don't that's a police cruiser in my building

2045
02:24:55,820 --> 02:24:57,820
You don't need to see my ideas and how this works

2046
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,640
Pence says he was spun around in place in handcuffs. Jesus

2047
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:03,660
You think the officer was drunk or something?

2048
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:06,300
That's what it sounds like

2049
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:09,900
Tara shavank or two hours. So I crashed into your dear god

2050
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:15,980
Pence's co-owner wick was taking videos and photos the police vehicle when according to pence

2051
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:18,940
Three of the officers went for him. He raised his arm and they said he hit him

2052
02:25:19,580 --> 02:25:22,220
Pence was eventually taken out of cuffs. Wick was taken by police

2053
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:26,940
In addition to cleaning up the damage pence some other morning trying to locate wick

2054
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:31,660
He later found that wick had been taken to the south patrol police station then the slu hospital for medical attention

2055
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:34,940
He was taken to the north patrol and finally an unnamed was a central booking

2056
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:39,500
Wick whose legal name is chad morris. Was that a term of felony assault?

2057
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:43,740
Oh, okay. So maybe he like tried to fight the cops after the cops crashed into his building

2058
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:48,860
So they're getting him with assault but the cops crashed into his building

2059
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:54,860
Yeah, but the proper the proper recourse that is to go to court, right? I mean, listen, like look at this shit like okay

2060
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:57,500
Something was up with that cop who crashed. Yeah

2061
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:00,860
He was probably drunk and he probably like

2062
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:05,660
Like all those cop other cop buddies to be like look fuck i'm drunk. I did something stupid. Help me out guys

2063
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:07,740
Yeah, so they're right. Yeah, that's probably that fuck

2064
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:11,340
Jesus. Yeah, that's the game and the officers are based

2065
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:13,340
Yeah

2066
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:20,540
Dude next article. I just love the idea of we're taking out the gays drive into a gay bar get out sort of arresting people

2067
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:30,860
Yeah, it seems like the police are probably like fuck here yeah, no, no the problem is they're probably not fucked they just are bad

2068
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:34,940
All right

2069
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:37,820
Please file felony charge against okay. It's the same article

2070
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:40,460
No, it's not

2071
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:46,140
Yep, he's facing a fella. He's facing felony assault against an offer. Mr. You're resisting arrest. Yeah, see

2072
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:48,540
yeah, so

2073
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:52,540
So so chad wick began to scream obscenities in the wake of the collision

2074
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:56,860
The officer writes that he then struck me hard in the chest with an open hand causing me to lose my balance

2075
02:26:56,940 --> 02:26:59,100
So basically lose your balance because you were drunk

2076
02:27:00,060 --> 02:27:04,220
he he so he attacked the cop who drove into his his his

2077
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:10,060
This is the uk, right? No, it's it's in america. Okay. Well either way, dude, you fucking drove into my business

2078
02:27:10,060 --> 02:27:11,420
The fuck is wrong with you?

2079
02:27:11,420 --> 02:27:16,860
Yeah, so so you attack you attack the cop who drove into your business and now you will and now you have

2080
02:27:17,420 --> 02:27:20,620
You're getting charged but like this is stupid. I agree. Some of those things are like

2081
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:24,380
The correct way to deal with police is like you can't just fight them

2082
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:29,020
I know but you have to like document and you have to be cool and like if if they're wrong it will come out later

2083
02:27:29,180 --> 02:27:31,740
Like you can't do this or else you'll just lose. I know

2084
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:37,580
I know but this is still stupid. Oh, it's stupid like they they're very clearly like in the wrong hand

2085
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:46,220
Wait, hold on. Yep. The attorney for bar pm says that bystander video contradicts the police account good. So let's see good

2086
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:53,420
Videos taken at bar pm contradict the police story. You know, what is actually probably good that he kept it private until you know, yeah

2087
02:27:54,060 --> 02:27:56,060
This is embarrassing for the police department. Let's see

2088
02:27:57,580 --> 02:27:59,580
Yeah

2089
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:02,940
Multiple videos of the collision and this aftermath tell a different story than when police are alleging

2090
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:06,140
And showed that morse's arrest was unwarranted. Yep. Yep

2091
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:10,940
See it's one of these things where like yeah. Yeah, you have to like document and record and keep cool

2092
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:13,020
Because you make things work for yourself. Yeah

2093
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:16,860
Okay, let's see here what is the

2094
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:19,180
20-minute bystander video tells his own story

2095
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:23,900
They unlawfully handcuffed him the falsely claiming speaking loud. He's against the law. These are pretty good domestic warrants. Yeah

2096
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:31,180
Yeah, man

2097
02:28:31,180 --> 02:28:37,420
So at no point in the 20-minute video shows more striking an officer in the chest. Yep. Yep

2098
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:39,180
Yep

2099
02:28:39,180 --> 02:28:44,380
Lord cameron says the best way to deal with the corrupt system is through the system dude. There are so many instances

2100
02:28:45,020 --> 02:28:46,460
of people

2101
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:47,660
like

2102
02:28:47,660 --> 02:28:53,980
Entire fucking cop channels like audit the audit shit like that like they're they're based on this where you show people who?

2103
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:56,700
um act properly

2104
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:59,740
And encounter with the police and it goes to court and they win

2105
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:05,340
We have so many examples of this you're being biased towards those few examples that go viral when it doesn't work

2106
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:07,660
But it overwhelmingly works. So yes

2107
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:11,900
It's actually good to know indirect soter. Thank you

2108
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:20,620
Yep, they lost control of the vehicle and immediately the video shows the police officers being aggressive with everybody in the area to cover

2109
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:22,700
What they did. Yep. Yep

2110
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:30,140
Yep, it's it was the cop's fault and they're they're reacting but still though giga chat driving to the gay bar

2111
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:33,660
Hey, shut up. Oh my god. You're so stupid all the time

A 25 year old canadian man had his driver's license a measly 20 minutes before being pulled over by police

And then you can book the test. Let's see. We're actually gonna look up and i'm curious. Okay?

In celebration the driver cracked a beer and decided to drive back to brampton on highway 10

2138
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:21,900
the driver

2139
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:25,180
Flew past an unmarked police vehicle drinking and driving

2140
02:31:25,980 --> 02:31:29,100
The officer was offering what 30 miles per hour over the speed limit. Holy shit

2141
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:32,140
Driver was moving out of traffic in a careless manner before he was pulled over

2142
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:35,980
Can't even begin to understand why someone would think that drinking a beer in their vehicle while driving a smart id

2143
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:39,500
A little a novice driver who should be well versed in the rules of the road. Who knows?

2144
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:42,140
Yep, he had his open beer in the vehicle

2145
02:31:43,660 --> 02:31:44,460
Yep

2146
02:31:44,460 --> 02:31:49,020
He had a concentration level above zero. Well, let's say his new drivers must have an alcohol in the system

02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:54,140
stunt driving careless driving

2150
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:58,460
Novice driver with bac above zero driving with open liquor and several other offenses

2151
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:00,300
These are not simple errors of judgment

2152
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:02,780
They are choices being made to fit the lives of other drivers and pedestrians at risk

2153
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:09,020
Simply put drivers like let's kill people no belong on our roads. Yeah, I fucking hate people who drink and drive honestly, yep

2154
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:15,340

So money tips what yeah for money yeah, so basically this is a veterinarian okay who's running for

2158
02:32:33,580 --> 02:32:35,580

2160
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:49,020
A democrat running for a crucial seat in virginia's house of delegates performed sex acts with her husband for a live audience

2161
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:52,860
And encouraged viewers to pay to pay them with tips for specific requests

Oh, she was doing it while she was still running for the race, okay. Oh, that's yeah

2168
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:22,780
So she hadn't given up the career before she decided to get into politics that might be kind of dumb

2169
02:33:25,100 --> 02:33:29,180
Listen I don't think politicians should be judged about their past for sex work

2170
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:33,100
But if you're still doing it while running for office, that's like what are you doing?

2171
02:33:33,660 --> 02:33:36,300
Yeah, poor kids. Oh my god. Did you guys see like

02:33:48,140 --> 02:33:54,540
I'm assuming she just had a child. Yeah, okay. Yeah, and I think she's out of porn now in fact, okay

2175
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:57,180
and

2176
02:33:57,180 --> 02:33:59,180
Well, imagine being that fucking kid

2177
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:01,740
Yeah, that's gonna suck like

2178
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:07,260
Your mom has a shit ton of porn. She is one of the most famous porn actresses of all time

2179
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:13,420
You're not going to avoid being able to go online to just see your mom like naked from like 15 years ago getting fucking railed

2180
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:18,780
Well, to be honest, there's so much free porn online that's new yeah, but like she's so popular

2181
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:20,780
She's in like banner ads and stuff. Like she's

2182
02:34:21,340 --> 02:34:25,420
She's one of the most popular porn stars. Yeah, that that part that part's unfortunate

2183
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:32,300
So like imagine this kid like 15 or 16 or 17 open up the browser late at night. No one's at home

2184
02:34:32,540 --> 02:34:36,540
I'm gonna i'm gonna check some porn out. Yep. Go online. Here's like an older video looks good

2185
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:40,220
It's your mom getting a fucking gang bang with like 18 giant black dicks. You're like

2186
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:42,140
Oh

02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:44,140
It's not gonna be in the banner

2188
02:34:44,540 --> 02:34:50,220
Or like imagine i'm well, no, it's just like girl gets destroyed you click on that one and just her it's like oh

2189
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:56,300

Okay

2193
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:16,300
So i'm always surprised that people who are like like really into sex work for a really long time actually want to have kids after

2194
02:35:16,300 --> 02:35:22,780
That like I like I understand that like many people have the desire to but like I don't understand

2195
02:35:23,820 --> 02:35:29,740
Why you would knowing it's like people who have like a lot of genetic diseases still decide to have children

2196
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:31,740
It's like why are you doing this to your children?

2197
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:37,260
Yeah, you're just giving them your terrible genetic disease. Oh my god blonde two dollars the black guys were measurehead and his brothers

2206
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:12,220

2207
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:17,100
but the videos remained live on another non-pastor protected site, which is probably uh

Yeah, you can see in the videos soliciting tips or performing specific acts of current violation of each terms and conditions

2211
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:37,020
Requesting or demanding specific acts for tips may result in a ban from the platform. Oh, wait, really? Yeah

2212
02:36:37,820 --> 02:36:40,620
Why is that banned? I don't know what?

2213
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:43,660
I don't fucking know you should have done it on only fans

Jesus yeah, the only thing's a thing in 2022. It was right. Yeah

2215
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,260
Speaking directly to the screen

She encourages viewers to provide tips which are paid through tokens purchased through the site in at least two videos

2217
02:36:56,140 --> 02:37:00,700
She agrees to perform certain acts only in a private room an arrangement that requires a viewer to pay more

2218
02:37:01,100 --> 02:37:03,820
I need like more tokens where I let him do that

2219
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:06,460
What?

2220
02:37:06,460 --> 02:37:12,140
Wait, she's raising money for a good cause. Is it her fucking self? Is it was her political career? Yes

2221
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:23,660
So dumb almost immediately the tips arrive she says thank you five times and tells her husband she will agree to the act

2222
02:37:24,380 --> 02:37:26,380

Everything has collapsed. All I know is the time to leave this country and go very far away

2271
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:47,500
Yep

2272
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:56,060
Half an hour after the gang stormed under the set police entered the building and later announced no arrests have been made

2273
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:58,220

I just want to say one thing

2287
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:55,660
The beginning of my speech was edited cut out and I didn't know about it. I want to read it

2288
02:41:55,980 --> 02:42:02,800
History isn't history anymore. Truth is not truth. Even facts are being replaced by alternate facts and driven by conspiracy theories and ugliness

2289
02:42:04,460 --> 02:42:06,460
Yeah, so

2290
02:42:07,420 --> 02:42:11,100
Basically, he gave the speech at the gotham awards. What is the gotham awards?

2291
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:14,940
I actually don't know what those are. I don't even know what they are either guys. What is the gotham awards?

2292
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:23,260
American film awards presented annually to the makers of independent films at a ceremony in new york city

2293
02:42:23,980 --> 02:42:25,180
Okay

2294
02:42:25,180 --> 02:42:28,940
Oh, okay, just a film award. Okay small a small award show

2295
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:31,500
so

2296
02:42:31,500 --> 02:42:35,340
He gave a speech about donald trump and when when it was aired on tv, they cut it out

2297
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:38,380
Wow, and he's mad about it. I mean to be honest I probably would be too

2298
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:40,460
I understand

2299
02:42:40,460 --> 02:42:44,380
It's really funny. Like this is hilarious, but I would also be very angry if I was robert

2300
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:56,860
He attacks the weak destroys the gifts of nature and shows disrespect for example by using pocahontas as a slur wait what based

2301
02:42:57,740 --> 02:42:58,860
Wait, what?

2302
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:00,140
he

2303
02:43:00,140 --> 02:43:02,560
Called elizabeth warren pocahontas

2304
02:43:03,440 --> 02:43:11,520
Because lizabeth warren claimed to be native american on her university enrollment to get like special privileges, okay, but she had um

2305
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:19,040
Like almost no native american budget less than me. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so we called it pocahontas. Yeah

2306
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:21,600
Just make fun of her. Yeah

2307
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:26,000
Well, here's the thing pocahontas it has in like in the past five or six years

2308
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:27,840
become

2309
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:32,320
Known on the left as a slur because trump used it as a joke and now it's considered a slur

2310
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:34,640
so

2311
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:37,360
Okay, yeah because well the idea is like

2312
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:45,360
The idea of a native woman who who ends up in like liking a white man and adopting white customs and blending into white society

2313
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:47,180
They call them

2314
02:43:47,180 --> 02:43:53,840
Pocahontas's well wasn't actually like the actual story of pocahontas like fairly sad. Yeah, but they're going off the disney bullshit. Yeah, okay

2315
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,240
Yeah, so he was cut out

2316
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:00,240
Oh

2317
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:05,360
Dude trump's looking old now like I mean he's almost 80 so like he's looking old damn

2318
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:09,920
They did his bronzer like real shiny. Look at that dude. His cheek is glowing. Yeah

2319
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:13,440
Like how it doesn't match his ear at all his ear

2320
02:44:14,240 --> 02:44:15,760
He looks like

2321
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,720
Okay

2322
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:21,360
Potato and his ear looks like an uncooked chicken wing. This is like a recent trump picture

2323
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:27,360
Even even trump 10 years ago looked better like trump's showing his age. Well, yeah, he's old. How old does he know?

2324
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:32,480
He's like 77. Well, yeah, 77 77 look old. Yeah, like

2325
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:36,400
Like here's trump from 10 years ago

2326
02:44:37,280 --> 02:44:41,520
Definitely looks better. Definitely. Yeah, you get old man. This is how it is

2327
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:45,520
And of course if you see trump from the 1990s like he's

2328
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:50,880
This is this is like tv trump, you know, this is the trump that everyone thinks of when they think of trump

2329
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:53,440
Is this guy?

2330
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:55,440
This is when everyone loved him, you know

2331
02:44:58,320 --> 02:45:00,320
Yeah

2332
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:07,520
How dare they do that how dare they cut it out, okay, dude, whatever

2333
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:14,720
No, listen, like if you're making like a whole speech like they shouldn't be editing it right like that's actually like pretty bad

2334
02:45:15,440 --> 02:45:20,080
Like it's hilarious that they have done this but it is actually quite bad

2335
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:24,320
And robert denier does have every way to be as every right to be as pissed as he is

2336
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,160
Yeah, but they have their data so fuck you fuck you right now why

2337
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:32,880
Because you don't just get to have unlimited screen time on their fucking award show talk whatever you want

2338
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:36,320
Yes, but look at the fucking game awards last year. That sucked, too

2339
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:39,360
It was hilarious and they should keep it in

2340
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:42,560
I want to see the whole fucking thing

2341
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:48,400
Okay, finally the final article for today guys

2342
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:51,360
Twitch is cutting one third of its staff

2343
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:53,120
Yep

2344
02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:58,960
Twitch is laying off more than 500 employees that ceo announced this morning reportedly accounting for around 35 of its staff

2345
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:05,520
Bloomberg first reported that the video game streaming platform was playing layoffs on tuesday and the company confirmed that the cuts were happening

2346
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:09,200
We're gonna have to share that we're taking the painful step to reduce our head count by about 500 people

2347
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,920
This will be a very hard day

2348
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:13,920
Yo twitch has way too many fucking people working for it. Anyway

2349
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:21,120
Twitch cut 400 rolls back in march of 2023 as as part of larger layoffs at parent company amazon. Yep

2350
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:24,880
Additionally several twitch executives including chief product officer tom verrilli

2351
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:29,520
Chief customer officer doug scott and chief content officer. Laura lee all announced leaving the company

2352
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,480
Last month the company also announced it would cease operations in south korea setting payably of expensive network fees

2353
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:37,120
Wait

2354
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:40,880
Well, I I zoned out for like a second. What did you say about people?

2355
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:44,800
Uh, the twitch pulled out of south korea. They no longer have like a south korean server. Okay. Yeah

2356
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:52,320
So, yep twitch the twitch business remains strong it paid over one billion dollars in in uh revenue to its to its streamers

2357
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:56,720
Sometime now the organization has been c has has been size based upon what we're optimistic

2358
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:59,520
We're going to be in three or five more years not to where we are today. Wow

2359
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:05,440
Base, I understand what's going on. Basically twitch is not growing and they gotta cut the fat

2360
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:10,000
Yeah, it's happened to a lot of social media right now. Yeah, that makes sense. That's how it's going man. This is how it's going

2361
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
This is how it's going

2362
02:47:12,080 --> 02:47:13,600
Tara shavankov five dollars speaking of politicians

2363
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:17,360
We're actually the old federman seems to have doubled down in many of his controversial positions since your video on him

2364
02:47:18,060 --> 02:47:19,280
based

2365
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:21,280

Yes

2367
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:28,240
That's the end of the articles guys, yeah, what do you think of today's articles fellas

2368
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:30,960
They were all incredibly sad except for the ones at the end

2369
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:36,560
There was a lot of well actually except for that shooting one there was like three funny ones at the end

2370
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:41,040
What the fuck dev well, sometimes you gotta talk about the news no

2371
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:44,800
Sometimes the news is fucked. It's just how it is. How about no

2372
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:47,920
That's just how it is dude. It's just how it is

2373
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
I dmed you on discord. So fucks

Read the read the articles about layoffs in the economy. Uh, we'll do someday blonde but not today

2375
02:47:59,360 --> 02:48:03,120
I've worked at the few places that were doing fine and the doors were chained up one day. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah

2376
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,320
Every thought on twitch is not hot. I haven't seen a hot one

2377
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:08,080
That's not true. The thoughts are hot

2378
02:48:08,080 --> 02:48:11,360
It's just the fact that you know, they're a thought that's making me not sparkles. You haven't turned into it

2379
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:13,840
You haven't turned into uh by a lesbian yet

2380
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:22,880
Tunic tonight, uh 30 chance of tunic tonight 30 chance less than 50. It'll be it'll be a

2381
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:29,360
Not half bad but no more femoid on the street what if I told you I have a penis

2382
02:48:30,400 --> 02:48:32,400
Uh, don't play into it

2383
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:35,280
You fuck up

2384
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:40,400
And then I can also say that I am not a transoid because I don't actually have a penis so I can be both

2385
02:48:40,480 --> 02:48:42,480
at the same time

2386
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:53,520
Oh, did you butters that must have been a surrealistic experience

2387
02:48:55,200 --> 02:49:00,080
I have low standards. I know I just told uh, I don't know what your price is for the n-word. No

2388
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:01,440
No

2389
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:03,440
What the fuck dev

2390
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:06,240
Hey, you're gonna say no to that much money. Yes, you need it right now

2391
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:10,000
I don't need it that bad. We need money right now. I don't need it that bad

2392
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:14,560
Okay, guys listen

2393
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:18,560
Oh five dollars made in columbia, thank you

2394
02:49:18,720 --> 02:49:25,520
Companies are questioning green tech dei and bloat as peter ziham predicted when the boomers retiring capital cost was in 3x and growing

2395
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:27,280
Here's the thing. Um

2396
02:49:27,280 --> 02:49:29,280
Green tech has its place

2397
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:37,120
dei and bloat really doesn't but there is definitely a place for um for green tech as thing like

2398
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:42,480
If you can have green tech that doesn't have the other downsides of green tech because there's some pretty bad downsides

2399
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:44,720
To some of it then you probably should adopt it

2400
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:54,080
Make an ai dev and have it say dude. Yeah, I just like make an ai voice have it say all the slurs

2401
02:49:54,080 --> 02:49:56,080
I want to say it's like it wasn't me

2402
02:49:56,640 --> 02:50:00,080
What's wrong with that if you make the ai say it it's still you

2403
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:06,800
No, yeah, okay. What if I make an ai new anyways and have that say the n-word then I will still murder you in your sleep

2404
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:10,320
It'll still happen

2405
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:15,840
Okay, listen, we're gonna get out of here. It's 3 p.m. I have a list of things got to get done today

2406
02:50:16,160 --> 02:50:17,600
I'm gonna go work on them

2407
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:20,800
Um, considering it took us almost three hours to do this. Yeah, I might

2408
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:23,680
I might do

2409
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:25,680
a late night

2410
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:32,400
Gaming stream, but the chance of that happening is about 30 percent. But again real dev fans watch the gaming streams

2411
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:35,360
Let's go raid kibbs

2412
02:50:35,360 --> 02:50:40,000
Okay, you can't say that and then probably not stream tonight. You know that right a second. Let's go raid kibbs

2413
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:42,800
You should do a sip every day

2414
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:47,040
That is like a long-term goal. If I once I have the studio set up I want to do like a daily broadcast

2415
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:50,400
Yeah, but that wouldn't work out for our daily lives right now. Not right now. Not right now

2416
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:55,920
Not right now, but I do want to do like a daily broadcast at some point. I like the idea of it, you know

2417
02:50:56,560 --> 02:50:57,600
far

2418
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:59,600
anyway

2419
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:03,440
Um, oh wait, are you even fucking open like i'm not even open right now

2420
02:51:04,560 --> 02:51:08,560
Hold on. Let me check the raid. I raid I set the rate to kibbs. Nobody else is on

2421
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:12,160
And kids are my default. Yeah, not even on

2422
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:16,720
Yeah, we're gonna go raid kibbs, all right listen

2423
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:22,320
Everyone pile in with the breed kibbzes and the coffee cups get them ready

2424
02:51:26,080 --> 02:51:28,080
Everyone get ready

2425
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:35,520
Make arguments chat a full time, please. Dear fuck no

2426
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:40,160
Okay

2427
02:51:40,400 --> 02:51:43,200
I can't read lonerbox. He doesn't have uh, open raids I think

2428
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:47,280
But anyway

2429
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:54,080
Let's bye everyone we're leaving we'll see you later. Okay. Good night. Night. All right. Good afternoon

2430
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:59,040
You
