27000	29000	Mmm
30000	31920	What's going on? Oh
31920	36800	Things are shaking. I know there are some people who have been like, I don't want they help me to be on the sip anymore
36800	39040	I don't care. I'll do whatever I want. I
41000	46040	Do not care I don't care I will do whatever I like
49000	51880	Hey dev new timer to the discord, well, don't worry, there'll be a new disco
51880	54100	Actually, I need to work on that today in fact after we're done here
54100	57060	Well, you don't need to have an entire conversation about it
57860	64020	Yeah, yeah, okay, but where's the media literacy video on the side channel and it's not coming out yet
65100	68380	Basically all my demonetized videos were moved over to the side channel
68380	72660	They're coming out once a day to avoid like fucking everyone's upload feed
75260	76980	So
76980	79260	See my list of things that offend Twitter freaks. No
80180	85100	No from the sip let's try to get ahold of nowadays she's very busy. All right, Peter. Fuck you are done
86140	88660	If he does third chair, thanks for the $2
89500	96220	Fuck. Yeah, let's been too busy with real life stuff. So I've been brought in as the unfortunate replacement
96220	98220	You're not even on the tubcast. Yeah, I know
99700	103140	So here's the thing I want to outline real quick what I gotta do today
103140	107100	Yeah, I want to I already wrote that one script that big long one. Yeah, I
107460	113540	Put I don't know if you guys saw it's an hour and 20 it's an hour and 20 minutes and it's gonna be fucking huge
114700	117020	It's we're gonna edit down to about 45. I think
119300	126300	But it's gonna be about like Sargon and James Lindsay's feud and but more importantly the idea is they're feuding over, okay
128780	134820	Dev cream, please not bring up Trump this time. Oh too late. Okay, that's okay. That's fine. That's fine. You don't bring up Trump. Okay, so
134820	136820	I
137220	143240	Talk about your cash as well and we get this out first so I want to write at least one more video. I want to
144380	147620	Maybe record tick-tock Tuesday today. Mmm sometime in the afternoon
149620	151980	It'll probably time to be honest we have a whole day ahead of us
151980	153980	I
156300	158300	See it real late anyways, I don't care
159180	161180	um
162060	164060	What else
164060	166060	The discord I want to work on
166700	167900	and
167900	172820	If all if all goes well, and I'm not being a fucking blob, which I probably am
173740	177300	I didn't do a stream last night. So I was working all night on that long video
177420	182540	I would like to fire up a tune extreme or something like some sort of make it up to you guys stream
183380	186080	If I do that, it'll be late at night though. It'll be the late stream
187100	193620	Because I want to because these these things I just listed off the discord the new discord the the tik-tok Tuesday
193620	195620	And then the new script they're all priorities, right?
196180	198180	so this the the
198700	201440	The tune extreme will be maybe probably not
202120	205640	But it might be a bonus surprise if I can keep it together then why mention it
205640	209800	Why not just have it be a surprise. So like I like laying on my thoughts. Okay
210640	214080	$5 from our nose following Naomi and Louis has never been hurt on the same stream together quince
214080	217500	I think I think you have I think you came in and likes talking to the Michael little hose on the stream once
217580	218080	Yeah
218080	220940	There was there's definitely been at least a couple of times were like
221160	225160	Somebody yelled a question at me through you and then I answered through the mic
227960	229960	Yep
230480	235200	Coming tricky Mario, I'm doing my best but hey
236920	242240	If for some reason I decided to turn this channel that this channel into just like a fucking stream channel, it's my business
244040	247680	Yeah, but you're I've always taken the opinion that I'm just gonna do whatever I want
247720	253880	Yeah, I know but your actual thought out videos are the better videos. Yeah, maybe yeah, that's no no, maybe
254560	255840	Fact
255840	258360	Zonta $5 coach red pill Russian spy and
259360	260960	Propagandist has passed from pneumonia
260960	267440	Of course Carl's who's Carlson and Don Jr. Who's Don jr. These people with the mentor Russian propagandist passing away
267440	271880	I should do a video on coach red pill to be honest because I mean
272480	278760	At that he's dead. He's not gonna be relevant ever again from this point on like he's fucking he just died
278800	282320	so if I have a bunch of um, I have a bunch of
282960	287600	Coach red pill stuff saved up from the internet blood sports days. I might as well drop it
288040	291700	So fuck it like not now is the time to make a video on coach red pill
294440	298520	No, he's a fucking asshole he was an asshole back then he's an asshole now
300800	302800	It's been like four or five days already
304520	308040	Another we have to wait a week till you found out then make news
308560	311480	Yeah, that's how that's how the niceties of the world work
312520	314520	hmm
316440	317840	It was apparently from neglect
317840	321340	Yeah, I heard like he he was in a Ukrainian prison because he was living in Ukraine
321800	325240	Spouting Russian propaganda getting paid with a Russian. So of course, he got fucking arrested
325240	330400	He's like what a retard right but even if you agree with Russia, like how dumb can you fucking be, right?
330400	338160	Don't live in Ukraine during a war with Russia and then spout Russian propaganda on the internet. Yeah, it's no so he
338920	344600	Gets you actually didn't you try to like hop the border into Hungary or Poland or something and he got arrested at the border
344760	349520	So he was put in a prison and the prison sucked and he caught pneumonia
349760	353280	Well, he was in the prison and there the conditions were just so poor
353280	357080	He just fucking died good to know that prison conditions all over the world are the same
358160	363200	He was also a spy when he avoided prison the first time and riding up the five spies he was working with fucking hell
363200	367840	Dude, I enjoy about $20. Thank you that video better mentioned liberalism self-destructive nature demand
367840	373560	You fight with the hand tied behind your back fact that defies your rule doesn't the reflection of your rules just because we're better
374200	378760	That will be actually a different conversation. I'm talking about philosophy not necessarily practical
379400	381320	implementation
381320	383320	But I do agree with you there
390960	394920	So basically, um, yeah, I have a lot of things I want to do today Oh
394920	396920	I'm
397200	402620	Speaking of the discord. Yep. New there's a new discord being built because the old ones a fucking trash fire new discord coming soon
402680	404680	I'll make sure to announce to people
405520	410240	Shouldn't you say that because of discord's new rules that to discourse new rules as well
410240	418000	Yeah, well no cuz like discord's new rules means that the new discord server is gonna be a lot more like it has to be stricter
418000	419000	Yeah
419000	421000	authoritarian
421480	426560	Like most anything that dev has ever done I have to because discord's like
427240	435160	Discord will fucking ban everyone on a server if someone on that server misgenders like it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah
440960	443800	So fucking awful, so I'm making a discord, um, what else
444920	446920	What else is really important to talk about? Oh
447760	449000	So
449000	452640	I haven't been talking about this anywhere else, but I have been talking about on the weekly sip
452640	454640	So I'll talk about it again here
454640	456640	Thank you very much. Derek. Appreciate it
457240	459240	Glad you enjoy. Um
460040	461880	so I
461880	464240	Did finally decide to try vyvanse? Oh
465360	469760	Yeah, I've been talking about like okay. I didn't realize you were talking about it on the set good to know
470760	472760	but only in the set
472920	474920	only only sippers know and
475480	482320	And here I'll give you my vyvanse take okay one it was way too easy to get
484160	487120	Considering that it's basically controlled meth. Mm-hmm. I
488000	494280	Feel like anybody sufficiently smart enough whether or not they think they have any sort of condition that requires vyvanse
494440	499120	can simply walk in fake it and get it because I I had a
499640	501640	Bottle like I went into the fucking
501840	506960	The the clinic I had a bottle of vyvanse within an hour. Yep. Congratulations
511800	514960	That is the same drug as I don't know how much destiny takes yeah, but it is the same drug. Yeah
515760	520440	You know, I'm gonna feel real stupid if I ever go to the doctors and I'm just like hey
520440	524520	Maybe I should try this and they're gonna be like yeah here and I'm just like I should have done this like
525000	530120	Yeah, I won't just go cuz I'm lazy and I'm also not as smart as you
530120	532120	So I might not get it
532880	535880	Like I was talking about after I came back home
535880	539440	I spoke to Taft edge for a whole bunch because we were talking about it now. It's just like, you know
543440	547960	The best way to learn how to lie is to watch Death Note, all right
547960	555960	To learn how to not lie like Light Yagami who makes all these fucking crazy ass faces anytime he's lying
556600	562960	Like when when Light Yagami lays out his thought process for lying
563640	565640	He'll say okay
565820	571520	You need to adopt a personality of the person who is innocent of the thing that you've actually done
571520	571920	Yeah
571920	577800	Which might mean in some instances implicating yourself in some way because that's what an innocent person would do
578000	579160	right
579160	581320	So yeah, of course I was at the crime scene
581320	583560	I just walked through cuz I was walking there like I walk there every day, you know
583560	587960	Like do something like that right where that's how you lie effectively is
589320	593360	You even if it means you you you hurt your own case in the short term
593560	597800	You you have to present something you have to present a false
598080	602660	Psychology that is consistent with a person who is actually telling the truth, right? So
603840	607360	That's a really good tip on how to lie, right? And so
607920	611840	when I was like sitting in the doctor's office and I was like I
613260	615260	Was thinking about it
615480	617480	I'm gonna lie about maybe
620720	626640	Felt like, you know, it felt like I was lying when I was laying it out because here's the thing
627200	629200	if she asked me to like
629840	633120	You know focus on something for 15 minutes as part of a test
633120	635840	And if I and if I couldn't do it, then I would be given the drugs
635840	637280	I could definitely focus on the 15 minutes
637280	643160	So I did feel like I was lying almost like everything everything that I filled out in the form was completely true
643440	647480	But it also felt like it wasn't even though I knew it was like it's like, okay
647480	650920	Well, do you do this behavior? It's like yes, I do. Do you do this behavior? It's like yes
650920	653640	I do like I was checking them off checking like yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, I do
653800	657000	Right, but it also felt like a construction
657160	662920	It felt like I was constructing the personality of somebody who was actually quite ill. Mm-hmm. You know, I mean, yeah
662920	667080	Well, I mean that's the problem with like being able to have good days and bad days, right?
667080	672600	Like you're a competent enough person that you can actually go to the doctor to get shit
672600	676260	You need to be fair to me took me five days to actually go to like I suppose go on Monday
676260	680200	No, I know but like it's still the fact that you can force yourself to go
680200	683560	You're not like a person who's like stuck like in a home like who's like actually
683760	688520	Helpless and can't force themselves to do anything. So it's definitely a what's that called?
689080	694800	I'm gonna read this super chat. Okay, sure. No, no, I'm done. That's fine. What's that called? What?
697200	699720	Okay, well there you go I knew you're done okay here in the lead of Columbia
699720	700600	Thanks for ten dollars
700600	704680	When things James Lindsay makes clear is that any response against the left has to be measured and well thought out
705000	708640	Because like because the opponent's reaction is the left's goal like in Spain or Argentina
709240	712000	Um, yeah, that's true. That's definitely true for sure. I agree
713280	715280	Hi food drops. Oh
715680	722020	My grandfather was a b-17 tail gun in World War two. He passed away r.i.p. Dude. I'm r.i.p. Grandpa
724280	729720	Dev hasn't seen code geass. I've been trying to convince him to not yet. Sorry. It's really good
729720	733340	You should watch I think I saw like a first episode with a long fucking time. You should watch all of it
733340	735340	It's really good. Yes, you gotta lean in more
736560	740480	Stop okay. So basically basically like
740480	745360	It's one of those things where I would say before vyvanse, I
750640	755680	Hey Jew lady, what about the tunnels? Have you got tunnels underneath the house yet? No. Maybe if it was like, only our house
759680	764320	Someone else was in the basement. Yeah. Okay. So here here, let me try to lay this out real quick. Okay, so
764320	767360	Basically, I would say before
768480	770480	vyvanse I
770480	776560	I had what I would call a sufficiently productive day about 30% of my of the time
777200	780000	That's not about right. I yeah we're like a lot of days
780000	784800	I'd be trying to do work and I just I'd be forcing it and it wouldn't be happening or I do way less work than
784800	791600	I should or I'd like do other semi-productive work that wasn't essential like cleaning the house or something, right?
791600	793600	You know what I mean?
793600	797600	And there has been some difference
797600	802400	Since it's been four days, so there's not gonna be a fucking crazy difference yet, right? And also
802400	807600	I'd say watch gundam. I already watched gundam. You're at a really low dose, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So here's the thing
807600	814080	I was given a 10 milligram dose for the first week and then a 20 milligram dose after that right and so
814800	820240	Basically with the first week I was given a 10 milligram dose for the first week and then a 20 milligram dose after that
820880	822880	Basically with 10 milligrams
823040	824480	um
824480	828400	Dom said it was a uh, it was a child's dose, right? Which makes sense
828560	831920	But also here's the thing like on the one hand vyvanse doesn't like alcohol
832720	835840	So it doesn't like it's not like you need more because you're heavier. I'm a fat guy, right?
836400	840800	It's not like that, right? So it'll affect the same amount no matter what but also
841360	846240	High blood pressure is an issue for me because i'm overweight and i'm out of shape, right?
847040	849040	And there definitely has been like oh same
849760	855760	No being overweight enough shape you can be out of shape and overweight, okay. Yeah, you definitely can yeah. Oh, well, yeah
855840	857840	Okay, I guess never mind. Yeah, never mind
859120	865040	It's called being thin fat. Yes winter wait winter dev is the laziest stuff. Yeah. Thanks for two dollars, man
865200	869520	It is kind of winter and summer dev are the same dev. Are they? Yes. Are they really? Yes
871280	877040	Yeah, so i'm so here's the thing i'm still on the initial like ramp in week where the idea is the doctors
877120	879120	Okay here i'll give you one week of 10
879600	883760	And then like a month and and like six weeks or something of 20
884560	886880	and basically this will be like the trial where like
887360	893520	The 10 will ramp you up and then the 20 will be where you stay. I mean like dom's on 30. Um,
894000	896000	I don't know where what?
896240	899200	I'm, pretty sure that's common. Yep. Sure. Yeah
900960	905760	Did I say something I should have said I don't know everyone forget what I just said the point is
907040	911120	The point okay food shops show feet jesus. Okay. The point is
913280	917760	Is that um, i'm still in the ramp up period but I have noticed like a little bit of a difference
918000	920000	But it's not like you know when you get high
920560	922480	Hold on you wouldn't know no
922480	927440	Lots of people report getting high and they feel it in that not just in their body, but in their mind
927840	933680	Lots of people get drunk and they feel it not just in their body, but in their mind, right? Yes
933920	938160	I've never felt any drugs in my mind. That's because you don't take drugs even when I have
939680	941680	Only my body whenever like
942400	948960	I i've definitely like had enough alcohol to be considered drunk before and it's only ever and it's only ever affected
949120	953840	It hasn't affected how I think it's only been like oh jesus. I can't fucking move like anything properly
954400	956560	But my brain's like pretty much intact. Um
957280	958960	and um
958960	962320	Same with same with weed right where it's like but you've done like once
963760	967680	I've done both these like a handful of times not very much though. It's been like over 10 years before
968800	970800	It's only it's been like over 10 years
971200	974320	So I expected that there'd be some sort of effect
975840	977120	On vyvanse
977120	979120	And there hasn't been I think the exact same way
979440	985760	People who are like people say like listen if you take adhd medication, you're gonna lose all your creativity. That doesn't happen now, maybe
986720	991360	If I get more which i'm going to it might as if if the dose goes up I might yeah
991360	997040	It's only been a few days. I think you need to like actually take a longer time before you form an opinion
997600	999760	Yep, it's very true. Um, however
1000320	1004800	At the same time I have noticed that my twitter binges when I go on them
1005120	1007200	They don't last three to six hours anymore
1007200	1010640	They last about 15 minutes and then I get bored of them and then I go do something else
1011760	1016400	And it's actually no longer. It's like oh I can just stop this like oh, I don't I don't it's no longer appealing to
1016800	1018800	To reply to this fucking retard
1018800	1021840	Right, yeah, because you're not chasing that dopamine maybe
1027040	1032080	Anyway, we'll see I mean, I guess I just started so who the fuck knows right? Yep
1036080	1041360	You're in your mid 30s all your career creativity is gonna anyway nah, that's not true i'm still pretty creative
1041680	1048240	I mean, what about those like musicians that are still like still going like 70 plus still making new music. That's actually good
1048880	1050880	so
1051680	1054720	And also like another a side effect of it one is high blood pressure
1054720	1058800	So I need to keep it and I need to keep a start working out more. I need to but also
1059520	1064640	Another part of it is yeah, I've got like fucking once every two weeks right now the the other the other part of it
1066000	1067440	Is um
1067440	1072080	It's not attention span. It's it's not actually affecting my attention span. It's affecting my ability to
1073360	1075040	drop
1075040	1077380	a negative feedback loop of reinforcement
1078800	1085200	That's what it's affecting right? So like every tweet on twitter is like another loop. It's another cycle
1086160	1089360	And getting the next tweet is always like when i'm arguing with somebody
1089440	1093760	It's like the next reply the next reply the next reply and it's all and each one is its own reward
1094320	1096320	Like i'm talking about like psychological reward, right?
1097280	1103200	Yeah, well, I think it's more serotonin, but whatever either whatever happy drug. Here's the thing. You're using dopamine in the meme way
1103200	1105200	I get it. Okay, so
1105360	1106800	but basically
1106800	1108800	Um, it gets to the point where it's like
1109600	1111120	Like for example, lots of people with adhd
1111120	1114960	They'll like hyper focus on like a video game for 18 hours a day, which I have done before right?
1115600	1120800	And it's because video games have this reliable reward pathway where like you're always
1122220	1125760	Attracted to the game because you're because you're getting steady
1127120	1131520	You're you're getting steady advancement through work in the context of the game
1131680	1133680	So like every time you do something in the game
1133920	1138880	It takes a little bit of effort and you get a little bit of reward and it's the steady feed which is like which which is
1139440	1142560	Extremely appealing to people who have adhd, right?
1143200	1145200	um
1146240	1151920	But also if you're sat down to do something that is very intellectual and very tough like writing for several hours that can be harder
1152800	1155200	and i've definitely been in days where it's like
1155600	1159680	I need to write this and I fucking can't get myself to do it because I can't like I can't fucking do it, right?
1160400	1161200	Um
1161200	1166880	So the fact that I was able to like I was able to write just out of fucking nowhere. I was able to keep
1167760	1172560	My mind on the task of writing this giant script that ended up being an hour and 20 minute recording
1173280	1177200	Like a couple days after taking these pills like oh, maybe I can actually do do some of these things now
1180400	1181440	Um
1181440	1188160	So here's okay. Yeah, and also i'm sad that I don't know the tune to that song so I can't sing the super chat
1188720	1190720	Song of touch
1192400	1199360	I'm out of shape i'm out of air, but my blood pressure is sky high fat rolls high
1200480	1206320	You know how to touch I know listen, I know out of touch but like not off off on the top of my head
1208400	1209680	Now listen
1209680	1214000	All I know is i'm out of touch and that's all I know really in my head. Yeah, okay
1214800	1216800	Thanks lady. Columbia for the five dollars
1217680	1220320	So here's the thing I actually agree miss sparkles like
1221120	1223120	so so on the one hand like
1223520	1227760	I I genuinely have the adhd symptoms. I generally have
1230080	1231680	The adhd symptoms
1231680	1235600	Where i'm like i'm like I went down the list and I checked it off and it's like I do actually do this
1235680	1239040	I do actually do this. I do actually do this check check check check check, but then like
1240960	1246240	The fact that I came in extremely knowledgeable about the drug and its side effects, yep
1246800	1251120	I knew exactly what to say. I already knew what form she was going to give me to phillips. I found it online
1252000	1254560	And I already like I knew what to say. I knew how I knew how to how to behave
1254800	1257680	I had it all pre-planned in my head. So it felt like I was faking it
1258000	1261600	Yeah, that's because you make yourself sound like a fucking scammer. I already knew what to say
1261840	1268000	I researched everything I did I did I did I did it doesn't matter if the doctor might have said something else because I knew
1269040	1273040	Let me put this way I went in so knowledgeable about the topic
1273600	1278240	That it felt like I could just drip feed her information about myself, which I did
1278960	1283300	To direct the conversation making yourself sound better to direct a conversation
1284080	1289200	To direct the conversation towards an end point that I wanted that was the correct end point
1289360	1295360	But nonetheless, I was the one who was in charge of that entire conversation. The doctor was going where I wanted her to go
1297200	1300160	You make yourself sound like a scam artist and I was just like well here's the thing
1300880	1306240	That's why I felt like a scam artist you make yourself sound like a scam artist that makes sense
1306720	1311380	Yeah, this is not imposter syndrome. This is just dev being a scammer even though he needs the drugs
1316320	1318160	Everyone does this and they know it. I don't do that
1318160	1323520	I just go to the doctor and be like I am not knowledgeable about this subject and you are because you took eight billion years
1323520	1325520	Of school for it. So tell me what to do
1326480	1330400	So here's the thing like a lot of people in the chat are saying like this is a bad idea dev you shouldn't be medicating
1330400	1332320	You should be able to do fair enough, right?
1332320	1336160	Here's the thing like if I go on these drugs for a month and they make me worse i'll go off and i'm like
1336160	1341040	Oh fucking like i'm not i'm not like devoted to I must be on the drug. Look I want to try it. So i'm trying
1341120	1345200	I mean like that's that's the way with like antidepressants too like sometimes for some people it takes like
1345760	1351120	Like so many tries with like each antidepressant to like actually find one that doesn't fuck them up
1351680	1354720	Really bad it fucks them up in the right way. Not the bad way
1355520	1357520	Yeah
1358160	1360660	Dev goes in age management when we get the trucker video based
1361600	1366000	One more day. Okay, you can re-up my bad neuroscience takes if you want next house, that's fine
1366640	1368560	Also, hey next house. What's up?
1368560	1373920	Listen, that's what information yeah, I know food shops. Okay here listen guys food shops isn't real really trans. All right
1374400	1378640	Food shops is the kind of person who watched way too much like sissy hypno
1379200	1383920	Porn and and like looks at way too much like like futa hentai
1384400	1388880	All right, and she completely psy-opt herself into becoming a girl. Okay. Yeah
1389200	1393760	Like I know I know everyone's going after food shops for the loli thing right now, but the real deep lore
1394400	1401520	The real deep lore is that food food shops is agp. All right, that's the jesus i'm trolling by the way
1404000	1408320	Oh, no, listen, I know I know the doctor here shit i'm actually well aware
1408400	1410400	but i'm just saying that I don't like
1410560	1414560	Do all the research and make myself feel like a scam artist when I need something from a doctor
1416800	1419680	Luke says food shops did nothing wrong giga chat
1421120	1422720	Okay, so here
1422720	1425600	Yeah, let me put it this way. Okay guys, there's a lot of people
1426240	1432080	Who say um that this is not it's not a good idea for me to uh for people to go on meds including me
1432320	1434320	And you know what?
1435120	1436240	I like
1436240	1438240	Kind of agree. Here's the thing
1439120	1440000	because
1440000	1443780	There's definitely a way there's definitely paths where like through enough meditation
1444240	1447600	And through enough like mindful. No, don't roll. I'm not doing giving some hippie bullshit
1447680	1450400	All right, like people change their behaviors all the time
1450960	1452960	through self-improvement
1453280	1455680	Listen just because you fucking can't don't oh, yeah
1456560	1461840	Don't you say the fucking man who's just like I want to move in like two years after we started dating
1461920	1464160	I'm gonna lose all this weight and get my fucking eight pack
1464160	1468320	It has how long has it been it's been seven fucking years you got even fatter and we were still in the same place
1468560	1474800	Yeah, I don't want to fucking hear your rules about oh anyone can just as long as they like do this and this ever
1474960	1480080	No, sometimes you just fucking need the medication to take that step to get you there. It's very possible. Yes. Yes. No, that's the truth
1480240	1484800	Sometimes you know, not everyone does because they have wait, let me explain what i'm gonna say you fuck
1485280	1490320	Also, hold on a lot of this is also your fault. That's why we're still here too. Yes. Yes
1490640	1494160	Okay, okay. Do you want to actually start airing shit on the fucking stream now me?
1495520	1497520	No, then stop
1497680	1502080	Don't fucking just start pulling real life shit out when I I have so much I can say with you
1502080	1508160	I'm holding back so much right now. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yes makes you a bad boyfriend for holding back when you when you're not
1509040	1511760	Okay, I won't do that then now me you fuck
1512960	1517840	Listen, i'm not the one giving a bad take about fucking shit like being hypocritical about myself
1518000	1522880	I didn't even finish the take you don't even know what's bad yet or not. Can you please yeah, but I know you know what?
1523280	1525280	Shut up. Shut your fucking mouth
1525840	1527840	Shut up
1530560	1532560	Okay here
1534640	1537040	Okay here here let me put it this way, okay, so
1538080	1541120	there are definitely paths for people who let's say
1541520	1546240	They get like let's say you take like like an addict who like someone who's addicted to like league of legends or something, right?
1546880	1552720	Someone who like definitely will spend eight or like overwatch like 18 hours a day on overwatch and just like lose their fucking mind
1552960	1555840	Because you don't lose your mind unless you lose well, no, yeah
1555840	1558480	But like at the end of that 18 hour
1559040	1563360	League of legends or overwatch binge and you like turn the computer off. You don't feel good. You know, yeah you do if you rank up
1563840	1567920	No, even if you rank up like there's like a hollowness to it where you're like if you rank up it's good
1568160	1570160	No, no, you fucking
1570380	1573440	Degenerate listen, all right. You're definitely like when you like
1574160	1579200	Get caught in some sort of in some sort of like cycle of perpetual reward
1580160	1581440	Even if you
1581440	1586960	Get more wins than losses. You still feel like empty and burnt out after you're done right do it. No balls
1587680	1592880	Thanks for the fiber Artemis, but you still feel empty and kind of burnt out. You're like, uh, you know like you're like, uh,
1594000	1596000	It like there's something there's something there
1596240	1600480	That like just it feels like like you fried your brain
1601200	1602720	almost
1602720	1607600	Doing like like spending that much time on something because it's just been constantly like feedbacking you
1608160	1610880	Um, you never played good video games. I'm sure I have I
1611600	1617440	Dude, can you hold on you never you've never been able to like relax enough to enjoy playing a game for 18 hours
1618160	1620800	So when I was like a kid or like a teenager
1621440	1623440	This effect that i'm describing did not exist for me
1623440	1628480	Yeah, I could sit there for 18 hours and play a fucking video game and just be like, yeah
1628960	1634800	But like in my 20s, that's when I started to feel like oh, I that's because you were supposed to be doing other things
1634880	1637120	Yes, well, no, it's not it's not the fact that
1637920	1641840	I have if i'm gonna sit around and play a video game for like all day on my day off
1641840	1645680	I'm gonna feel absolute terrible by myself. No, you're only gonna feel bad about yourself
1645760	1648640	You're supposed to be doing other things even if I had nothing to do
1649040	1651200	Let's say that I was like a billionaire
1651360	1654960	Okay, and I had nothing to do and I could just sit around for 18 hours a day playing a video game
1655440	1661760	I would still come out of that being like, oh that's a bit too much only after one day of 18 hours or multiple days
1661760	1666640	Of 18 hours, you know what probably like I do it once in a while and feel okay
1667040	1669040	but if I was doing it like
1669120	1674800	Every day or like multiple days in a row. I'd be like, nope. See that's understandable. Nope. That's a bit much
1674880	1678160	Uh, so like but here's the thing you kind of get caught in these feedback loops
1679040	1679920	these um
1679920	1684640	The these neurological cycles where like you're you're getting like the next dopamine hit constantly, right?
1684800	1688000	You get caught in that and so you're looping and looping and looping and looping and looping
1688480	1692560	Right, you use the phrase earned dopamine 18-hour gaming system versus finishing a roof makes sense
1692560	1695920	Yeah, but I don't even know how to start a roof. Thanks you. Thanks for 20 dollars, man
1696560	1700800	There's definitely like, uh, here's a personal problem. I'm talking about a personal problem. Thank you for three dollars, dude
1701120	1704480	um, so like here here, let me let me try to let me try to try to
1705440	1708640	The weight the bad gut bacteria tones for a lot of mood brain issues tons of research on it
1708800	1713600	I should die before you're trying that farmer crap. Oh, don't worry. My dad's actually a lot better recently sammy for sure
1713920	1716800	Oh, and you know what? That's another side effect of the fucking
1717840	1722240	Drug is my appetite's rat like is decreased by quite a bit rapidly. Uh, yeah, dude
1722240	1728720	It's actually day one day one. My appetite was down and it's been down ever since yep. I'm like, oh I could just not eat
1729760	1733280	What do we had today? I've had one piece of avocado toast and I feel like
1734000	1736880	Not hungry, but not full. I feel like satiated. Yeah. Yeah
1738720	1743600	I can't tell if they need any issues meds or not. Maybe i'm just poor on self-motivation or need less caffeine
1744320	1750480	So can I answer this? Okay, go ahead. Okay, so the actual way to be able to tell is that if you can't get yourself
1750800	1753360	To do the things that you know, you need to do
1754080	1759860	Like for a really long like if it's been like if you're just kind of noticing these symptoms attempt to try self-discipline
1760320	1765280	And if self-discipline works great, but if it's been like many many many years and it's just like oh, well
1765280	1767280	Maybe i'm just poor at self-motivation
1767840	1773200	Yes, because you need some pills to help you out. Maybe maybe to help out your self-motivation just a little bit
1773280	1778720	This is like years years of notice. There's there's there's there's one weird trick you can actually apply. Okay?
1779600	1780400	Okay
1780400	1784720	If you drink coffee, well, no, I make the avocado toast myself. Like we make it here
1784880	1788560	We don't we don't spend twelve dollars for like delivery avocado toast. It's cheap to make at home
1788720	1790720	We make we make it ourselves. Okay, so
1792000	1795360	If you drink coffee and rather than riling you up it calms you down
1796000	1801920	Then you might actually like be you might there's a decent chance you'll respond positively to adhd meds
1802640	1807040	Because coffee is a stimulant, but it has always calmed me down and like made me focus
1808000	1810720	Well, isn't that what coffee's supposed to it's just coffee's just supposed to wake you up
1812080	1814640	But Naomi you drink it and like bounce around and jitter
1815680	1821840	Because i'm not awake beforehand just because you wake up and are actually perfectly able to like go and do a task and i'm not
1822160	1824160	It's different
1824160	1826400	They're having these effects on day one. Well next house
1826400	1829520	I didn't I didn't I didn't even get to get a chance to finish what I was saying
1830000	1833680	Because the chat and Naomi pulled me off multiple tracks regard
1834560	1836560	regarding the dosage
1836640	1838880	I'm seeing minor effects
1839600	1841920	And they are ramping up over the course of the days
1842880	1844880	But the first day I felt almost nothing
1845840	1846880	um
1846880	1848880	Actually, I also fucked up my first dose, too
1850400	1856240	So if you take vitamin c with vyvanse the vitamin c neutralizes the vyvanse and I took like a fucking
1856480	1860080	500 milligram vitamin c tablet the same time. I took the vyvanse. I didn't know
1862560	1865200	It's fucking funny dude i'm like wait nothing happened
1866800	1868800	It's like oops
1869520	1871520	But no like like things i'm actually
1872320	1874320	Happy with how things are ramping up
1874640	1880080	Because I am noticing like yeah, i'm able to log off twitter more i'm able to not waste so much time on nonsense
1880320	1885440	I'm able to do more writing. I feel absolutely no need to go snack in the kitchen whenever i'm bored like
1886000	1888160	A lot of things have already changed and it's quite nice
1888800	1895120	Um, so i'll probably stay on go take grape juice with your drugs. I'll probably stay on the regimen that I have right now
1896560	1900800	And if after the after the trial things need to be changed we'll change them if not i'll just yeah
1902960	1905920	Here's the thing right you'll just start taking actual death it'll be fine. Oh, yeah, sure
1906640	1908640	the other thing I wanted to say though is like
1909920	1912160	A lot of behavioral stuff
1913100	1917200	Theoretically can be changed through good habits and good willpower
1917740	1919740	however
1919760	1925280	Responsible use i'm keeping i'm on make it very clear responsible use
1926640	1931440	Of a prescription medication can often just get you there. Yep
1933120	1935120	That's supposed to be the point of like
1935760	1939760	Stuff like this is that it just lets you live like a normie
1941200	1945520	instead of your your secretly depressed self well, it's funny because like
1946640	1951200	Like dom described it as getting her to baseline. Yeah, but I don't describe this as getting me a baseline
1951440	1953600	No, I describe this as getting me over baseline
1953840	1957120	Yeah, and which is why another reason i'm like maybe maybe I actually did just make it
1957680	1964400	Well, no because like the problem with like adhd and autism is that it's such a fucking wide spectrum of so many like
1964940	1966800	differing
1966800	1970240	Every symptoms and everything is that well for some people it might just be like yes
1970320	1972720	Now you're at the baseline can act like a normal person for other people
1972720	1976240	It's like now I can just actually focus on tasks and that's all I needed. Yeah
1976720	1978720	so so for example like, you know
1979440	1980800	is it
1980800	1987360	A feedback reward problem when you're like addicted to a video game when you play for 18 hours and you feel terrible afterwards. Yes
1988000	1990000	But it's also a habits problem
1990240	1997540	And with good habits, you could actually overcome that and however, it is like a completely uphill battle to have somebody who's already predisposed
1998320	2003840	To engaging in those bad behaviors to build a good habit that allows them to resist those bad behaviors
2004240	2006240	You can do it, but it's not a battle
2006320	2011200	Well the the ideal the ideal use for for drugs like this is to get on them
2011600	2016800	So that you can then build the habit and then even if you get off them the habit remains because you've now
2017040	2022800	Because now you have behaviors that are reinforced through just daily routine and not simply
2023520	2030720	Uh a drug of some kind it's kind of like using stone staircases to get to level 100 of the skull caverns in stardew valley
2030880	2034960	Instead of just fighting all the monsters and finding a hole the meds are the staircases. Yeah
2035200	2039200	And the thing is like there is some virtue in actually fighting your way to that point
2039200	2042320	Because you can then say like I actually did it like it's a it's a character thing
2042560	2047360	I know you don't agree with me, but I think I generally think that there is sure there's stop taking the meds right now dev
2047680	2052880	Um, actually build the good habits that you've been saying you needed. So here's the thing even though you just chastised me for
2053360	2056880	For uh being stuck in in the mud for a couple of years. Here's the thing
2057600	2059600	I've gotten pretty far
2059840	2061840	Without any sort of help
2062080	2064720	More than most people. Yeah, and i'm proud of you for that
2065040	2067280	Yes, well, but wait, why would you be proud of me?
2068160	2070080	Hold on if you don't believe no no
2070080	2075920	If you don't believe that there's any virtue to be found in getting through something based on your own willpower and your own efforts
2076240	2078560	Then why would you be proud of me for doing for doing as much as I have?
2079440	2081440	I'm proud of you. Oh
2081760	2084960	Because you know that i'm right i've never proud of you for anything ever again
2086800	2088800	Nope, never mind
2089680	2091680	So
2094400	2096400	Come on I was trying to be nice
2096880	2098960	Don't be nice to dev ever again. What do you mean? What do you mean?
2099680	2104320	But here I appreciate you being nice. No, but okay. I just want you to tell explain it to me
2105040	2107600	Um the fact that you can still do work
2108240	2109520	Okay, you know what?
2109520	2113680	No, I cannot explain this. I want to hear it. Listen, I can't explain this well enough
2114080	2117040	But thank you for the two dollars. It is pretty good for me so far
2117120	2119120	I will take the mental note not to be nice to you anymore
2119200	2122720	But I what why I do not have the vocabulary at the moment to explain myself
2125040	2130720	Dev's debate brain rot is strong to be honest. We actually do I think that actually is a problem on my end is like
2131360	2133040	You'll you'll say something and i'm like
2133040	2137760	Namely, that's the complete opposite thing of this thing that you said like three fucking weeks ago that I remember like with pinpoint precision
2137760	2140640	You're like what the fuck and i'm just like yeah, I mean, how come you're consistent and you're just like
2141440	2143040	Fuck you
2143040	2146640	I do this a lot and it probably is a problem on my end. Do you think I don't know?
2146720	2148720	Do I I don't know do you I don't think about anything
2151120	2153120	Dev do meth and beat nooms
2155440	2157440	Dev doesn't understand women
2159200	2163840	But anyway, yeah like it's one of those things where there is virtue if you can
2164800	2166480	Get there yourself
2166480	2170800	But the people who are very puritanical about it and they're like you should therefore you should never actually like you
2170960	2175040	It's like no no fuck that like if you go on drugs for a couple years and then build a bunch of good habits
2175040	2178000	Then go off of them and those habits maintain and you have like a good life
2178480	2182880	Like what I don't see a problem with that. You know what I mean? That seems like it's it's good. It's okay
2187120	2189120	Uh, what do you think sure
2190560	2194800	Okay, listen just because you're currently mad at me for really bad reasons
2195200	2201120	Yeah, doesn't mean it doesn't mean that you you can just not reply on the fucking show. I did reply. I said sure
2202080	2205920	I'll also pay more attention to the chat than you because they deserve it. So you know what?
2208800	2215360	I got breast implants because of foreign. Wait what food shops really? I mean, why not breast implants are good
2216080	2222080	Dev is doing meth. Yeah giant tips like I know like meth is the meme but vyvanse isn't exactly meth. Yeah
2223200	2228080	And things are doing actually, okay. You know what like it's I I you know what let me put it this way
2228080	2229920	Okay
2229920	2231920	I am starting to see
2232000	2234000	uh certain improvements
2234080	2237200	They are ramping up. I'm liking where this is going
2237920	2242800	But if like if things go wrong, i'll stop but right now I actually feel pretty okay
2243520	2248560	The only downside is that I had a heart attack a couple days ago, but that's fine. We'll just get we'll just get through it
2251120	2255040	Nobody's giving me like a weird look did you no i'm joking
2258080	2260080	Oh
2266880	2268880	That's what you get for being mad
2269920	2271920	You get trolled
2272080	2273760	Hi, i'm dev and I make jokes low
2273760	2278240	But i'm gonna make it a totally straight tone and then just wait to see if people realize it's a joke
2278320	2280640	Even though I know it doesn't sound like a fucking joke
2281280	2283280	Jesus fucking christ
2283280	2285280	I'm, so fucking done with you
2286240	2291760	I've only been up for like two fucking hours. I'm already tired of being alive
2296960	2300480	Five dollars, I didn't have a heart attack. We're joking five dollars
2303200	2306480	Five dollars from lives and dev's walls. Thanks very much. Doug said he couldn't make it
2306560	2310960	He told me to tell you your butt also. Hi newms. Hey lives and dev's walls. Come comfort me
2310960	2312960	Okay
2313520	2315520	We do a little troll
2320080	2325520	I I did figure out though that like there actually is there can be heart issues if you like
2326720	2331360	Okay, one if you have already high blood pressure like I do because i'm a fatty and two if you have your high blood pressure
2331440	2336240	One wasn't even that bad. It was only a bit higher. It was it was it was higher. Yeah only a little
2337440	2340560	Okay, hold on. We literally had this discussion in the car with dave and dom
2340960	2343280	Okay, I don't know. What should
2344000	2346000	your blood
2347020	2349020	Pressure be
2350560	2354080	Should be between 90 90 over 60 and 120 over 80
2354640	2362400	Okay, high blood pressure is 140 over 90 or higher low brush. Okay, so yours was 130. Okay
2363360	2365760	It literally takes you right there. Okay, let's see
2366640	2367440	Yeah
2367440	2369200	so I had
2369260	2370320	Hypertension
2370320	2377520	I had high blood pressure stage one hypertension. So it's like what between 130 and 139 or
2378080	2383200	180 89 so like I had that doesn't say 180. Oh, sorry 80 and 89. Yeah, so I had
2383840	2386160	One I think was 130 over 100
2387920	2388720	Okay
2388720	2392960	Which is definitely considered to be high blood pressure, but like I said, like it's high
2393280	2397520	It should be lower but you're not in a danger range yet. Yes. That's what I just said. Yeah. Yeah
2400160	2402160	Thanks rock
2404960	2407280	So, yeah like because my blood pressure is
2408000	2411680	Already higher than normal. Um, they're like listen, you can take the vyvanse
2411760	2414160	However, it does come with higher than normal blood pressure
2414160	2419360	So you got to keep a watch on it like take get some blood pressure tests if you start to again
2419600	2421440	If you personally hit dev out
2421440	2423440	Thanks for the two dollars
2423440	2426960	So wait if since it's two dollars does that mean I get to hit you twice? No, okay
2427520	2433760	It's five dollars. Can I hit you twice? No, what about ten? No, it depends on the message. Okay
2438800	2440800	So basically, um
2440880	2442560	I have to like measure it
2442560	2445920	Because i'm already kind of over like out of shape. I have to measure it constantly
2446560	2447920	and
2447920	2454160	I will lose weight. Yes, but also like not eating as much will help but they also said like listen do not have coffee
2454560	2456800	Around the same time as you have yeah vyvanse
2456880	2461440	Yeah, because one the coffee will actually neutralize the vyvanse the same way the vitamin c does but if it doesn't
2461760	2464320	You'll be hit with like a double dose and it'll like really fuck you up
2464960	2466960	And I might have had I might have had um
2469040	2472320	Coffee at one day. I think I think I had coffee too close to the vyvanse
2472320	2475040	So I was like I was like, oh I was feeling it just for a minute
2476640	2481440	Wait an hour is what I have to do. Oh titanium. Are you on vyvanse? I didn't know that I didn't know that wait an hour
2481600	2482480	Yeah
2482480	2486720	I mean, that's what I did. Uh, i've done that aside from the first day where I fucked it up
2486880	2488960	I've been doing that pretty consistently like waiting an hour or two
2490160	2491040	Yeah
2491040	2493680	Which sucks. I like having coffee since I wake up, but whatever, you know
2498160	2500160	Coffee's done
2500720	2505440	We're 15 years now i've used it really so how is it for you dude i'm kind of curious
2508320	2509760	Normal
2509760	2510720	Yeah
2510720	2513120	Yes, I guess it'd be easier to use it just normal now
2516160	2518160	All right
2520960	2523920	Okay, has it really been 40 minutes what do you talk so long
2525360	2529520	I'm gonna open this package. I forgot to set up the camera though, but i'm gonna open the package anyway
2529600	2531600	Well, listen now we won't accidentally talk someone this time
2534320	2539760	You literally hit the mic what are you doing it makes the autism more powerful it reigns in the age of 80d base
2540080	2542080	What what how much do you do you take titanium?

2690160	2692640	Wait, is this from before milo went like full retard?
2694400	2696400	Oh, is that his dog that's so cute
2697520	2699040	boop
2699040	2700640	Boop to the dog snoop
2700640	2704720	Yeah, because here's the thing milo had I will in a minute. I just want to see their book. Okay
2705520	2710880	Milo is a right wing gay guy, which I still don't understand in america, but okay
2711600	2714720	Yeah, he wrote this in 2017. Yeah, because like he went through like several
2715520	2717200	several iterations
2717200	2719200	of of his career
2719280	2722000	and right now he's gone through, uh
2722720	2728320	He has voluntarily gone through conversion therapy and he claims that he's now just fully straight lies, obviously
2730240	2735520	He's just like every other republican politician who's having sex with young boys on the side and now he's like trying
2735840	2737840	He's trying to play up like how he's this. Um
2738640	2743600	He's totally this completely reformed straight man who's fully christian and he looks like a fucking
2744160	2748880	Unironically like a fucking meth addict like he looks completely like strung out, right? Well, maybe he actually is strung out
2749040	2754800	Maybe maybe but this was written in 2017 when he was still on the rise and wait is milo. He's not american
2754880	2759440	What no he's um, he was greek who moved to britain at a very young age
2759520	2762480	Then he moved to america, uh when he was older. Ah, okay
2762560	2765360	Well, I apologize to the americans in the chat. I obviously offended
2765440	2766560	No
2766560	2773360	Yeah, milo went through like several cycles of like just relevance and fading away and relevance and like he's got he's reinvented himself several times
2773360	2775360	And it's all been retarded
2775360	2777360	Milo fell off so hard. Richard spencer is now higher than him
2777360	2784480	Yeah, like I saw that destiny milo debate like six months ago and milo looked like a fucking wreck. Okay, you know, okay milo looked like
2785680	2787680	What ken looks like?
2787920	2788640	Who?
2788640	2792400	Ken in the barbie movie when he has like the two pairs of shades and the big fur coat
2792640	2796160	Like like that's funny, but milo actually looked like that and he's like I look good
2796160	2800240	But he also looked like he was fucking like high on drugs the entire time. I'm like jesus christ. Milo. What the fuck?
2800320	2804000	So he doesn't look this cute anymore. No, that's unfortunate here. Hold on. So like
2804720	2806400	Let's see
2806400	2808320	milo
2808320	2810320	That's just the milk
2810800	2816000	Come on, but just search up his last name. Jesus. You don't even have to spell it. It's right there. It's right there
2816480	2820720	Damn it, you fucking boo. Okay. So like yeah, this was like milo 10 years ago
2821360	2822560	Not that cute
2822560	2824080	all right, and
2824080	2826080	No, yeah, like his moments, right like he's
2827040	2829200	He's like justin beaver. He's
2829920	2833680	He's definitely like kind of made a name for himself being like
2834480	2836480	A twink even though he's right wing
2837360	2842740	And he kind of went through several iterations of it, but now milo in 2023
2845280	2847280	Like
2847760	2853040	Yeah, he fell off hard I do well I think it's also because he doesn't look that great with blonde hair yeah
2854160	2858640	No, just like like a lot of this a lot of this go back go back. I don't fucking know
2858640	2864800	Why is there a pacifier? I don't know in that woman's mouth, but here compare this right like this is when he was like
2865280	2870880	He was young. He was still gay. He was hot. He was still right wing. He looks like a pop song. Yep
2871440	2873680	Not a singer a pop song pop song
2874400	2876400	but like compare that
2876960	2879600	To this and the problem isn't just aging
2880160	2883680	Like eight there's aging present, but it's not the the problem isn't just aging
2883920	2889680	It's also that he's completely transformed himself into a completely unlikable person when at least before if you hated him you couldn't deny yet style
2890080	2892080	You know what? I mean like
2892240	2894240	Yep, damn
2894320	2896400	Even with the bags. He's still hot. Yeah
2897520	2899520	like he just he just
2900160	2902320	I don't know dude milo really fell off
2902880	2906800	Hold on like here. Can I see all he needs to do is dye his hair back dark. It'll look better
2908960	2912160	Okay, i'll i'll pull up the the video at least okay
2913440	2915440	Like yeah, yeah, yeah
2916560	2918560	Yeah, like what are you doing buddy?
2919360	2922960	He doesn't look that bad. He's also hair isn't blonde so he looks better. Oh, yeah
2922960	2926960	Well, it's also like the things he's saying and how he's like like he's jittering around he's talking
2926960	2932000	He was never like this. He looks like he's he's not even fucking present. I don't know. I'm only judging him by his looks
2932880	2934880	to the crazy gay man talk
2935520	2940400	Yeah, okay. Sorry. I I didn't share the screen. I'm sorry. I forgot. Okay, there's a card though another card

2971600	2976080	Everyone will eventually lose whatever physical appeal they had in their youth
2976320	2977200	That is it
2977200	2982480	Even if you stay in good shape throughout your 30s and your 40s and your 50s one day if you're still alive
2982640	2986160	You'll be a hundred you'll be a big old bag of wrinkles and that's just how it is. All right
2987680	2989280	But
2989280	2995360	There's a difference between like aging gracefully and looking pretty good for an old person versus
2996080	2998160	Like being fucking madonna, okay
2999520	3003040	Kilometers matt for the five dollars. Thank you. Hey dev. Just want to thank you for your political insight
3003280	3007680	I felt alienated as a black libertarian your class and your style of classical liberal ideas fit. Well, thank you very much, dude
3007920	3012880	Um, i'm not a libertarian though, but i'm glad that you at least uh, enjoy my uh, my content. So thank you
3013120	3018000	I hope I hope it you it helps you somehow. Yeah, because like here yeah, i'm gonna I will pull this up
3018000	3022480	Okay, well you're gonna actually share i'll actually share the screen this time. Okay. So here, uh, let's see
3023680	3024720	um
3024720	3026720	What was his name?
3031440	3033920	Okay, yeah so like
3038000	3040000	And then i'm gonna pull up
3043280	3045680	No, can we not look at madonna nope, we're pulling it up
3046560	3048800	Okay, so here i'll show you what I mean
3050640	3053200	Okay, yeah, i'll bring it in so
3054080	3057280	Here's pierce brasner with his wife, you know back in the 90s
3058320	3064560	And now like he's aged pretty gracefully. Okay, if they're in hollywood and they are aging gracefully
3064560	3070800	They've definitely had plastic surgery done, but it's been subtle plastic surgery. No, that's not a possible. Here's the thing like okay
3070800	3075440	She's 60. Yeah, and she looks great. She looks good for 60. She does but she's doing great
3075840	3082000	Probably had plastic surgery to help make herself look good. Yeah, and like just fine aside from being part of the hollywood degeneracy
3082080	3085760	Pierce brosons always said like why would I abandon her because she's getting older
3085760	3089600	So am I she you know, we've had kids together. We're a family like I love her like no
3089920	3093920	What the fuck like why should I have some fucking side piece like like this is my family and it's like, okay
3093920	3097280	Yeah, you know fair enough, right and I mean like like he still looks pretty good
3097360	3100480	Yeah, he's hot and she looks pretty good for for being 60, right?
3101120	3106160	Yeah, and then so like like they don't look young anymore is the point but they still look good
3106400	3108800	Silver foxes and cougars are my bread and butter
3109760	3115600	Like they look good for their age. You can't be 20 forever. So it's better to
3116160	3122320	Accept aging with dignity and and do what you can with it and settle plastic surgery and this is the good
3122720	3128400	The good example with subtle plastic surgery. It doesn't have to be surgery. Yes. I'm telling you if you if you can afford
3128560	3131920	Here's the plastic surgery. All right, that's also plastic surgery. So
3132800	3134320	Here's madonna
3134320	3137120	Here's madonna before and here's her now
3137920	3140320	And she looks like a fucking alien. Yep, and like
3141120	3143040	She I think she's also in her 60s and it's like
3144080	3148240	Why would you do this to yourself? You know, what's a you know, it's a better one who's who uh, pull up share
3148880	3152640	Share. Oh god. Yeah, you want to really see the unfortunateness pull up share because madonna
3152640	3156080	You know what still kind of looks the same but it's weird because we know she's old
3156080	3158960	But she still like sort of has the same face and I say sort of
3160000	3162880	Yeah, like if you try to stay young for too long, you just look alien
3163040	3168880	Yeah, but no you need to pull up current share 2023 versus share like 19
3170080	3172080	20s
3174720	3176720	This maybe yeah
3177360	3178320	like
3178320	3181200	It you it's kind of funny to share actually kind of looks okay there
3181520	3186880	But like you can tell because you can like see the outlines of her cheeks, it's weird
3189200	3194320	That's also kind of a good picture of current share yeah see bad pictures of share fucking no
3196880	3200560	That one's not great neither's that one oh, yep
3202960	3209680	Yeah, like yeah, she's 77 when will I feel old will you keep injecting yourself with the blood of infants?
3212000	3215120	Is that anne boleyn who did that no someone else I don't remember
3217280	3219280	But yeah, man like
3220240	3224640	This is not accepting aging gracefully no and you look worse for it like
3225360	3229840	You're an old lady now madonna it sucks, but that's just that's the natural cycle of life
3230160	3235200	You know, you don't get to be young forever. Yeah, the point is to be a hot old person not a hot
3235760	3239440	Like not an old person who's trying to look young and be hot. You gotta be a hot old person
3239600	3241600	There was actually what's funny is that like I
3242080	3245760	I was with my grandparents and they were like visiting we were all visiting like some of their friends
3247040	3251520	Or whatever and like there was a lady and she was she was super fucking hot and she was like
3251820	3257280	65 or something and she was like like super thin and she like just all the style. She looked great
3258320	3260320	No, I can't
3260560	3262560	Do you just did no problem
3263440	3265440	Okay, ow, ow, ow, okay
3266080	3270560	Sp elite five dollars. Thank you dev. Your beefs will be over faster. You just stopped arguing so they called them fucking
3272080	3277760	Okay, i've been advised wait, I didn't mean to leave it, but I did I didn't mean to sorry that was an accident
3278160	3279680	Can I delete it?
3279680	3285760	I can't shit. I didn't mean to delete that message. Sorry, so much for freedom of speech. Whoa
3287120	3289120	Okay
3290400	3292400	Sigourney weaver
3292480	3298820	Pull her up dev. Okay. I'll take a look. I'll take a look search google you boomer. I'm gonna add 2023
3303200	3306960	Yeah, it's gonna be still hot, okay, that's uh, that's pretty good
3308240	3311360	I mean, yeah, she's out on the older right? Well, yeah, she's like an old lady now. Yeah
3312160	3314160	I want Sigourney Weaver to step on my face
3314720	3316720	Really?
3317040	3320160	She looks very old there. Well, that's awesome movie. Yeah makeup
3321120	3323120	So here's the thing, right like
3323600	3325840	People that that guy it wasn't number whatever his name was
3326000	3329120	He said that like you guys are talking people who fell off like this everyone gets old, right?
3329760	3332960	But no listen, we already fell off so ergo we can talk about everyone else
3333120	3338400	Everyone gets older but you don't have to get old just because you get older. You know what I mean? Like
3339840	3344400	Bye sketch you can find pictures of me on the show from 10 years like the gaming channel from like 10 years ago
3344560	3347040	And I definitely look younger and thinner. That's how it is
3347200	3351840	Even if i'm at the point now where even if I lose all my fat i'll probably still look older
3353040	3355200	That's that's just the natural cycle of life, right?
3355600	3358720	You don't have to you don't have to lose your spark just because you get old but I think
3358960	3362320	Chasing youth is what makes people lose their spark in the end. Yes. Yeah
3363600	3364800	So, yeah
3364800	3366320	Okay
3366320	3368320	That's why I tell you not to dress like a hobo
3369120	3373040	I just like a hobo though. You kind of do every time people complain. It's like damn, you know
3373040	3380240	I'm just i'm buying another fucking another fucking pair of shorts another fucking oversized shirt. I am full hobo mode
3381040	3384800	You just said you don't dress like a hobo. I said I do. I know I said I do. No, I said I do
3385120	3389440	You just said no, I don't dress like a hobo and then you just now said that. No, I didn't. Yeah, you did
3390400	3392400	Rewind it. I'd fuck you
3392480	3396320	Um tricky mario for five dollars seeing those images will forever making respect betty white
3396320	3400720	She ate your ice cream just I have a hundred. Yeah, man. She did it. Okay. Also listen. Oh,
3401120	3404640	Kilometers matt for five dollars. Thank you. As long as you hold the classical liberal ideas and hold both heads accountable
3404640	3409120	I don't care for the priority. Honesty is king. Here's the thing about classical liberal ideals, right is
3409840	3411680	They're good, but they're incomplete
3411680	3417380	You can't only be a classical liberal else. Everything just falls apart and it's the main reason why socialists have been undermining liberalism
3418880	3423780	And honestly libertarians have the same problem like here. I know a lot of you guys are libertarian
3424160	3426560	I'm now going to make all of you angry real quick. Okay?
3427760	3429600	um
3429900	3431900	libertarianism and socialism
3432880	3434880	They ultimately pursue the same goals
3435680	3443200	Now they have drastically different methods for achieving those goals and the methods are so different that they are mortal enemies
3443840	3449600	But they're still aiming at the same target. All right, they both claim to desire freedom
3450080	3455840	And they both claim to desire material prosperity and they both and they both claim to desire human rights
3456080	3462640	Now they have very different paths that lead to those goals to those end states, but they're aiming at the same thing
3464640	3466640	Else you missed the super chip
3467200	3470240	Oh, did I let me scroll back up? Where's it? Where's it? I don't know
3470880	3476640	This one compare. I said this one compared to deli parton. I don't know. I said you miss it. I I I I don't know
3476640	3480400	Yeah, deli parton is also fucking like terrible. Yeah, she's yeah
3480400	3482400	Yeah
3484720	3492880	Here goes dev talking no, it's true it's true. Yep, of course, that's true. Yes. How is it not true? It's totally true
3496480	3501520	He's right when you think about the basic president, of course think about it like so if you ask libertarian, what do you want?
3501840	3506320	He'll say freedom. He might even say equality depending at least like equality of access
3506880	3514000	Because you know if you if you um remove monopolies from the market you have equality of access to the market right so freedom equality maybe
3514480	3516480	uh material wealth and prosperity
3517040	3518320	um
3518320	3522400	Human rights, you know, but then you ask a socialist they'll say the same thing
3525040	3529120	Socials will say I also want material prosperity. I also want freedom. I also want rights
3529120	3531760	Wait, I thought but oh no, that's communism. Never mind
3532000	3537360	However, they just have very very very different ideas on how to achieve those ends, but they have the same ends
3540640	3542640	Now if you talk to somebody who
3543120	3546080	Is completely different someone who says I don't want freedom. I want order
3547040	3549040	Now he's actually aiming in a different target, right?
3549840	3551100	so
3551100	3553100	libertarians and socialists
3553120	3555120	they uh
3556000	3559440	And some in some very strange ways they're two sides of the same coin
3560400	3564980	Because they want the same things. They just have very very different ideas on how to get those things
3573200	3576800	If you want to be safe and secure and you don't really care about freedom that is something different yeah, yeah
3578000	3583120	Yeah, see here's the thing here in a leading company. Yeah communism's freedoms are not freedom. It's a here's the thing right that criticism
3583520	3585440	Even though I agree with it
3585440	3587440	That is you simply saying hey
3588320	3592000	The socialist says he wants freedom, but socialism won't give him freedom
3592240	3596640	So you're not arguing over the you're arguing over whether or not the method will get you to the end point
3596880	3599360	You're not arguing over the end point itself. You understand?
3605920	3610720	Sierra 7 10 dollars there are actually a lot of former right-wing libertarians that swap to be a bit more authoritarian because eventually they see
3610720	3616500	How libertarianism can't sustain itself from being undermined by socialists. Yes exactly so a lot of libertarians
3617440	3622080	Either they leave their ideas undeveloped which does happen a fair amount frankly
3622800	3629840	They become more authoritarian over time because they understand that you need some sort of social fabric to hold the whole freedom thing together
3630320	3635200	And that's like I think like dankula is slowly going that way scrump definitely went that way
3635760	3636720	um
3636720	3642000	Or they become more left-wing right and for example, that's kind of how lilith drifted over time
3643040	3645040	So I think like libertarianism
3645600	3649120	Is like an unstable position that reads and that falls in a certain direction
3650640	3654080	The rest is zero two dollars libertarian responses actually leave me alone
3655360	3657120	Oh, there is a coin
3657120	3659840	Oh, there's a uh, there's a cool. There's um
3660720	3664560	Dapper, thank you. Thank you. There's a piranha plant coin in here super mario
3665360	3667360	Oh, thanks very much, dude
3668880	3671280	You can flip this coin piranha plant or logo
3672800	3676000	Not heads or tails actually would this be heads and this would be tails probably
3676800	3681200	Yes, because there's no head. Well, I mean unless you count toad's head on the other side, but it's so small
3682000	3685600	You just dropped it under the desk. I did I dropped it under the desk. Well, it's down there now. We'll get it later
3685600	3687600	Yeah
3690320	3694800	All right, I sent a video of a dude saying that dev has socialism wrong the title says it's for sfo fans
3694800	3696800	Okay, I'll look at it later. Thanks miss sparkles
3697520	3701440	Uh, two dollars real hold center dev. Did you read my ten dollar super? I'm sure I did
3702720	3707280	Surely I did. I don't think we've actually missed any I think I don't think we have yeah
3710160	3712160	Five dollars from those and does walls. Thank you
3713120	3716560	I'm willing to hear arguments, but you need a stronger case than they both want good things
3716560	3721520	The stated and vision looks very different. Um, it really doesn't in some ways, right?
3722160	3728000	If you were to if you were to ask them about their ideal society, both of them will say well individuals can
3728400	3733360	Prosper and be free and flourish and you know, they'll have their idea and but it's all utopian bullshit, right?
3733680	3738640	Um, but also here's the thing when you say they both want good things that presumes that these things are good
3738720	3745760	Right, like you're presuming that freedom and equality and human rights and material prosperity are all good things and for me
3746400	3750900	Those can be good things in some instances and they can also be very bad things in other instances
3751360	3754320	Which is why i'm not on the libertarian socialist spectrum
3755760	3758960	Have you missed five of my bit chats on twitch? Oh, no blonde
3759120	3764480	Oh, you can't fucking insult me by spending one dollar to give a giant fucking paragraph anymore
3765440	3766560	Fuck you
3766560	3769040	Okay, i'll go look at him. Fuck. Okay. Let's see this bullshit
3770480	3771600	Okay
3771600	3775920	Hi, naomi. Yes. Yes. This is the milo book is from before he went full retard
3776000	3780880	I was actually supposed to get a signed copy of his book, but I realized he was fuck's ever put in my address. That's funny
3781600	3783600	Uh, you mean why do you hate your fellow blondes?
3784160	3786160	In some water too, actually, um
3786560	3788080	I don't know
3788080	3790080	I hate everyone equally
3790720	3795280	I could be wrong but the old photo on the right might have been brosnan's first wife who died before he came
3795360	3797200	He became james bomb maybe
3797200	3802560	Maybe so but he has been dating her for like not dating married to her for like years and like decades, you know, so
3805040	3807040	Okay, so
3808880	3813680	Should we actually get on today? I mean it has been in like a full hour. It's fine. We're having fun
3813680	3816160	We're hanging out. You guys don't want to hang out. I don't know
3816800	3818800	You know, you know what would probably be better if
3818800	3822080	Is that we did this and then at like and then you finally get to the articles
3822080	3828560	but after we're done the stream if you are the person that puts in the time stamp of when the articles actually start in like
3829200	3833200	In one of the comments and pin it that's the monster. He does that. No, they don't
3834240	3835440	Hold on
3835440	3841360	Kilometers matt for five dollars. Thanks for shattering my belief steff. I'm now an anarcho-communist demi-queer trans femboy nice based
3841600	3847520	Haha, yeah, the reason that i'm a liberal and not a libertarian is because like there's obviously a place for for government
3847840	3852160	Sometimes there's actually a place for very heavy government intervention depending what we're talking about
3852640	3858640	And to ideologically be committed to the government should do everything or the government should do nothing. I think those are both failed positions
3862640	3866800	Like no, I don't want my co-workers having votes and what luxury goods am I allowed to purchase my personal earnings
3867040	3870240	See good emperor that is again a conversation about methods
3870400	3876240	Right because libertarian says the libertarian will say co-workers having votes and what luxury goods you can purchase
3876480	3878240	That will lead to less freedom
3878240	3883520	But a socialist would say co-workers having votes and what luxury goods i'm allowed to purchase will lead to more freedom
3883760	3888480	So you're disagreeing on method but not on goal the way out of the trap is to understand
3888720	3894240	That you actually shouldn't be advocating for freedom at all times. Sometimes you actually want less freedom
3895120	3900560	Which I know is it's a very bitter pill to swallow for westerners to actually have to understand because
3901040	3907780	Every western political school of thought whether it's liberalism or socialism or libertarianism or even conservatism
3907920	3914160	They all advocate for different types of freedom different ways to get more freedom, but sometimes freedom is actually bad
3917120	3919120	It just depends what we're talking about
3919840	3921840	Yes
3922160	3926560	Well, oh fuck there was there was oh god, I came across a fucking take from some socialist who was like
3927360	3929120	um hot take
3929120	3932320	But if the child's enjoying it and isn't injured
3932560	3936480	It doesn't matter if she can if if liberal society thinks she can she can consent or not
3936640	3941040	Okay, I want that person like to actually that's an argument from freedom because it's about consent
3941120	3944240	And listen, I want that person to be raped in the ass
3945040	3949840	With the cactus it's so ridiculous and then be like, oh well, no you you consented
3950160	3952320	That that person was named food shops
3952960	3954800	No, i'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding
3954800	3959680	If I ever if I had a gun and I ever heard someone say that in real life, I would just immediately shoot them
3959760	3961760	I don't care if I go to jail. I actually would
3961920	3965440	I 100 fucking would this is one of the reasons why I don't let myself own a gun
3966320	3968080	I would kill too many people
3968080	3975200	Kilometers matt two dollars. I'm not that far libertarian. I'm sitting moderate. Okay, here's another like black pill for libertarians, right? Um,
3976000	3979040	I know that you guys like to divide up positive and negative rights
3979440	3982000	But they're actually the same thing just from two different points of view
3982720	3984720	And you cannot truly divide them up
3985040	3987040	and in fact the um
3987440	3989440	The mechanism by which you divide them up
3989840	3993040	Which is basically defining who the who the who the initial aggressor is
3993440	3996320	That only makes sense if you value libertarian principles
3996560	4001360	And if you don't because sometimes there actually is a good reason to aggress upon somebody else if you don't
4001920	4003920	Um, then the whole thing falls apart
4004320	4010720	Uh, but that's I don't know I feel like marty mcfly being like you guys aren't ready for that one yet
4013520	4015520	You guys aren't ready for that one yet
4018320	4020800	Um, let's see I do have news articles we can talk about if you want
4021600	4024720	Probably should you talk about the news articles? You probably should okay
4026080	4028080	Acknowledge me. Hi
4028640	4032240	Nova two dollars from blonde. Thank you. You know, we killed plenty of people with a machete
4034240	4038880	But listen now that people know that I did I can't use a machete anymore that's the way it goes
4039600	4041200	I'll change it up
4041200	4043200	Add some pizazz to my murders
4045120	4047120	Bro what the fuck
4047440	4049440	Hey food traps
4049440	4055280	Any example of bad freedom is overshadowed by the negative consequences of the externalities of restricting freedom in the first place. That's not true at all
4055680	4057680	That's not a universal rule. No
4057680	4059680	I
4060080	4064480	Like how this heart thing is just blocking it's right in the way the fucking chat. Yeah, I hate it
4064800	4069120	So bad at everything is this dev this dev's nrx root. Here's the thing
4069200	4074800	All right, because well no food shops will know this because she's been going through the open lettered open minor progressives. Um,
4075440	4080640	The neo-reactionaries have their place in politics. They have good critiques of things sometimes but
4081840	4083840	Their solutions are ultimately
4084160	4085920	um not convincing
4085920	4093200	But they've identified real problems and most liberals ignore those problems by simply screaming you guys are fascists
4093280	4096160	Which is not it's it's not an intellectually satisfying answer
4097360	4101360	Oh, don't don't get it. Wait, hold on sparkles. Listen. No, wait, wait
4101520	4103760	If you send the glitter package send it soon because we're moving soon
4104240	4109040	Okay. Well, listen our place is covered in glitter because for those of you who watch the gaming streams, you know
4109040	4112160	I have to wear a peach dress which I do not look good in but yeah, I think you look good in it
4112400	4118560	But um the thing is covered in glitter and so now there's just pink glitter everywhere all over the house
4118640	4120640	We just keep randomly finding it
4120800	4126240	On everything and I don't even go that many places in the house while i'm wearing that dress so
4126960	4128960	You can but it's already covered in glitter
4130240	4132160	glitter and sparkles
4132160	4136720	Also from dave's fairy wings, which he likes to wear all the time around the house off camera
4138800	4140800	I got into the vents
4141600	4143600	Sorry
4144960	4146960	Put more glitter on naomi and dave. Okay, we'll do
4149040	4150320	Yeah
4150320	4151360	Okay
4151360	4154000	She's trained you well, though. What do you mean? Listen? I say she looks good in the dress
4154080	4155280	I think she's good in the dress
4155280	4159040	Listen, if he even puts on something I don't like i'm gonna tell her i'm not that fucking cuck
4159200	4162480	I'll be like does my ass look fat in this it'll be like yes or no. I'll just say it
4162960	4164960	My ass looks fat all the time. Is it fat?
4165600	4167600	Well, that's pretty good
4168560	4174960	Yeah, let's be elite okay dev baby i'm sorry, but you have trump derangement syndrome late it's okay though. No, I don't know
4175920	4181040	Here's the thing trump derangement syndrome is marked by people who can't articulate when they don't like trump. I can articulate it very easily
4181760	4184000	It's not like he's orange or he's evil. He's a fat
4184640	4188560	No, like I can actually tell you why I don't like him. It's easy. That's because he's orange and rich. Oh
4190720	4192720	Okay, we should start the articles
4193040	4195040	Throwing a flashback
4196080	4200480	Is it article time guys, it's been an hour article time an hour and 10 minutes. Wait, hold on I need
4201200	4204400	Guys stop blonde. Thanks for five dollars dev. I'm serving for you so hard

4225200	4230400	Fucking trump. You just how am I supposed to do? Well, because you're then you let me fucking say it first

4241760	4243760	I can't follow no
4244640	4251140	Uh sierra sierra seven ten dollars. Thank you hot take anorex accelerationists and neo left-wing people are converging towards the same conclusions
4251360	4255680	But accelerations want to make the problem worse. I have no idea what to do. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, i'll do with that
4257680	4262720	Yeah, I can't i don't think artemus is here if artemus isn't here I guess I won't yes don't I guess I won't
4266000	4271600	So it feels bad though feels bad I wanted to articles. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't even much from you fuck. I don't care
4272480	4277680	Some other goddamn political thing and we've been talking for an hour about literally nothing. No, hold on
4278240	4281200	I want to ask artemus what it would take to get one of those fat
4281520	4287040	100 super chats because he sometimes drops like 100 or 300 dollars before like listen if you play a certain game
4287280	4290320	Or you watch a certain movie or you do a certain video on a certain topic
4290560	4292720	I'll give you a big fat super chat and to be honest
4292720	4297360	I want one of those big fat artemus requisitions because i'm i'm willing to do a video now now that
4297360	4302560	Video now now that i'm all vivanced up I can answer your question now that i'm all vivanced up
4302560	4306400	I can sit down and watch and do a review of whatever the fuck I can answer your question
4306880	4308880	It's called you got to suck his dick more
4310400	4312400	Rather than having your own
4313120	4314160	um
4314160	4318160	I'm back and looked you skipped my sit down or super whatever before you go with the package. Okay, was it?
4319680	4323760	I'll go look i'll go look real quick. Okay. I'll go look before we do articles. Sorry real quick real quick
4323760	4325600	Real quick
4325600	4327600	Stop
4328240	4330560	Your time isn't worth as much as arches fuck you see
4331280	4333280	Gotta suck his dick more. Oh, no
4334080	4336480	Gotta facetime live and make those motions
4338320	4340320	Yep
4340960	4342960	Okay, let's see if we can actually find it
4347760	4353200	Just scroll down until you see ten dollars sierra. Nope. There we go
4354640	4356320	No, I did answer this one. Yeah
4356320	4358160	I think there is virtue in doing it without meds
4358160	4362400	And I think there's virtue in having humility and awareness to take meds if you need them rather than trying the same thing
4362480	4363040	That doesn't work
4363040	4363520	Yeah
4363520	4368080	So like if you can build positive habits such that you don't need the medication you should do that
4368480	4370480	If you do need the medication, then that's also fine, right?
4371120	4377360	Yep. Yeah, I completely agree. That's what I said. See this was my take and you didn't even let me fucking get it out
4377360	4381280	Because you just raged out when I said there is virtue doing it without meds
4381440	4385440	I was gonna say the other half of it and you just fucking lost it. Listen. I all I did was roll my eyes
4385520	4387120	You're the one who reacted
4387120	4389120	No, you fuck
4389760	4391520	That's what happened
4391520	4394000	Maybe he'll do it if you add a dev beg email
4395680	4397680	You fucks
4400080	4402080	You fucks
4403120	4407460	Yeah, actually i'll do it before we start even though it's been like an hour jesus
4411280	4413280	So
4420560	4424080	It's all good holtonator, you know what I think we both might have read it
4424720	4430480	And then like didn't like totally respond to it out loud. Maybe yeah. Thank you for the thank you for all the donations today
4432160	4434160	Um
4434320	4437920	Probably you haven't tried building positive habits. Oh, I absolutely have star hawks. I built a here's the thing
4438160	4442400	I've built a ton of positive habits over the years my habits like 10 years ago were fucking
4442640	4446400	I actually can confirm that dev actually has a lot of positive habits
4447440	4449440	Wrong artemis, but hey, hey artemis, too
4451760	4453760	Yeah, okay
4454000	4457360	So let's let's get on the road on the road
4458880	4462560	On the road again, that's okay. You have a different argument in the chat
4464400	4466400	Okay
4467360	4471200	Well, goodbye partial goodbye chat because now you're small and I can't read you
4473120	4477040	Pop it out make a big I don't need to see the rest of the screen. I want to see what's going on here
4477200	4478560	Why shut up?
4478560	4479680	so
4479680	4484720	Here's the p.o box as always actually when we move the p.o box is up in july
4484800	4487280	Should we just like keep it keep it here for three months where you move it?
4487840	4491600	I'm, not driving six hours to check on a p.o box. No, of course, of course, but like well
4491760	4493920	But we'll probably come back to visit at some point
4494880	4498320	My parents so we'll just check it on the way back like once or twice no
4499280	4502400	I can't close it. You already paid for it. They send packages
4502480	4506800	Here's the p.o box, by the way, send your packages to this this address and also donate to the channel tomorrow
4506800	4508800	I really do appreciate it you were saying
4508800	4514880	I was saying that just make sure to tell everyone not to send stuff. Are you abusing my fucking?
4516320	4518000	Back scratcher. Yes
4518000	4523760	Why because I can give me that no fuck you. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. I don't care
4524080	4525920	It's mine now
4525920	4527920	Bitch, you know what?
4527920	4532640	I'll scratch. I'll scratch you don't stop it out. Stop it. I don't want to use it. My back my back
4534400	4536740	Listen it's my back scratcher I get priority
4538240	4542500	I saw your hello message. Nova dev was just going on a long rant so I couldn't respond
4548240	4550800	Try and get the op box redirect, is that a thing?
4551600	4553600	Yeah, you honestly
4553600	4555600	Shortly before we should just ask
4556240	4558400	If we can get them redirected to somewhere else
4560960	4562720	Uh, oh
4562720	4567040	Yeah, because I mean I can just read I can like get another p.o box redirected to where we go. Yeah, I mean it's possible
4567040	4568560	Yeah, well, I mean if we're getting it redirected
4568560	4573120	We could probably get it redirected to our actual address and then like set up a p.o box there. Um, yes
4579040	4581040	Thanks
4583600	4585600	So
4587920	4590500	God dev shut. No, shut up. I'm telling him
4590900	4592900	Ah
4608420	4612500	Sp elite for five dollars while dev's typing. That's why I said tds late
4612580	4617620	You're not a sketcho about it, but you do just have the worst takes about him debate sticks about him though
4617780	4620820	He's literally an orange he's literally orange
4628420	4632100	Imagine if we got on the news today, I know I know dagoth I know
4636180	4642260	Okay, hey honey bun five dollars from sp. I already read it. Oh, yeah while you were typing sure god
4643380	4645140	Okay
4645140	4646900	Let's get to the news
4646900	4648900	That is a different thing
4649220	4654580	That's also a fascist newsletter. Listen, it's for research. Don't fucking think anything too late. Don't do it
4657460	4659460	Okay, let's go
4660020	4661700	On to the articles for today
4661700	4666580	Nintendo switch 2 will reportedly feature 120 hertz display. Oh, I sent this to you. Yeah
4667140	4672340	New new details regarding hardware specs for the upcoming successor to the nintendo switch dubbed the switch 2 have been revealed
4672660	4674660	The handheld will feature 120 hertz display
4674660	4681140	So that means that it can go that in handheld mode. It can go up to 120 frames per second, which is way well
4682260	4685700	Most computers run between 20 30 and 60. Um
4686980	4693140	Well, wasn't there more than 60 is kind of overkill frankly, wasn't there that research that you actually can't see over like 30 frames a second
4693140	4697620	Yeah, that was all bullshit. Yeah, that was bullshit if you say so. Yeah, everyone says that but it's like
4697700	4699700	Yeah
4700660	4706260	Yeah, that's bullshit but this is happening hooray, yeah, wait is it gonna look like that no this is just a mock-up
4706340	4711060	Yeah, uh, we're supposed to learn here's the thing people are saying that the switch will probably release next christmas
4711140	4713380	Which means we'll probably learn about it sometime in the next few months
4713940	4718020	So I want to switch I want to say that I was I think I found this on reddit
4718020	4721540	And so I was reading the comments and he was a redditor. Yes
4721940	4726180	so I was reading the comments and people were just like, oh man nintendo never puts out like
4726820	4731000	Anything that's current gen it's always like like it's the power of the ps4
4732020	4734500	That's been the case since gamecube. Yeah, I agree
4734980	4741860	However, everyone keeps forgetting that this is also a handheld console and it's primarily a handheld console
4741940	4746900	So without having the power of a ps4 the handheld console is actually really fucking cool. Yeah
4747780	4754120	Well this here's the thing. So the gamecube came out and the gamecube was roughly on par graphics wise with the ps2
4754680	4757320	And the original xbox, yeah, they were pretty much all the same
4757400	4761960	Yeah, um, and then the wii comes out and the wii was not much better than the gamecube
4762440	4767080	So therefore it was one generation behind the ps3 and 360 which were about comparable
4767960	4774760	Which is why the wii didn't get all the multi-platform games that ps3 and 360 did but what the wii did get
4775720	4778760	It had the wii remote and it had the huge install base
4778840	4783880	So people started putting out a bunch of cool things on it then when the wii u came out the wii u was
4784680	4787960	About the strength of the ps3 and the 360. Yep
4788040	4793880	So in the ps4 and the xbox, um, the xbox one came out they were again one generation ahead
4794520	4798920	So the wii u got a few of those ps3 and pia and and 360 games
4799160	4802360	It got a few of those initial entry level ps4 games
4802520	4807400	But for the most part the ps4 outclassed the wii u right now the switch came out and the switch
4807880	4810680	Seems to be more powerful more powerful than the wii u but not by much
4811640	4815880	So nintendo has definitely said, you know what we're not going to go with better hardware
4816120	4818920	We're going to go with other things that make the game
4819640	4821720	The system that make the console unique
4821720	4825880	So we the the wii remote was a success the wii u gamepad was not
4826200	4829800	And the switch the the idea of having like the joy cons are basically just wii remotes
4829800	4834520	But they're much better and the idea that it's both a uh, a handheld and a docked platform
4835240	4837240	Is also pretty incredible. Yeah, right
4837400	4840840	So and also like nintendo basically started
4841640	4846440	A new era of handheld gaming because after the switch success that's when you saw the steam deck
4846680	4848680	That's when you saw like the rog handheld
4848840	4853640	That's when you saw like all these little handhelds were showing up because nintendo proved that oh you can actually have
4854600	4860280	A devoted portable gaming device that also docks with your tv so you can use it in both modes. Yep
4861080	4863080	The switch was a massive success
4863080	4864600	All right
4864600	4866600	So I have a feeling
4867240	4868680	because nintendo's kind of
4868680	4870680	Nintendo has has had this
4871160	4876040	Back and forth with like one generation has been a success one generation has been a failure pretty consistently now for a while
4876520	4879720	If the switch 2 is just the same thing as the switch
4880040	4885000	But with better graphics, it might not be a very big success might not that's fair. I'm gonna get it though
4885000	4887000	I like yeah, read the thingy
4887880	4889880	Mark the cyborg. Hey mark mark. I didn't know
4890840	4893880	All right, actually, I think I knew but I forgot that your girl from his x-ray girl, right?
4893880	4895880	Yeah
4896600	4901480	Um mark the cyborg low target fidelity spec means games which don't cost hundreds of millions to make
4901800	4905640	Nintendo can be dumb, but their dev target philosophy is based. Yes, that's true
4905960	4909320	The only issue is that like when the big multi-platform games come out
4909400	4912040	They're always not on nintendo systems and that can be a problem, right?
4912360	4915320	So like when like what's a big multi-platform game right now?
4915880	4917880	Right now. Yeah
4917960	4922440	Yeah, like if that's not is that even on console? Yeah, is it? Yep. It's on ps4 and xbox
4922760	4925480	You mean ps5 ps5 and xbox?
4926120	4928920	But it's not I don't know the kind of but it's not on switch. It's not on the switch
4929560	4933960	Like before it was like the arkhams the arkham games, right? Those are big multi-platform games
4934760	4939080	The arkham games are now on the switch. I believe yeah. Well, yeah, but they're like they're like 10 years old now
4939160	4942600	Like when they first came out they weren't on nintendo's console, right? Yeah
4943160	4948840	What's the deal with v and his audience seemingly having derangement syndrome towards you? Here's the thing quinn. Um, it's because
4949800	4954760	V and his audience and I am critiquing v now, but we are friends and this is not me backstabbing him
4954760	4957880	I've told him this to his face. We have our disagreements, but we are still good friends
4958520	4960120	v
4960120	4962920	V believes in some things that personally I think are wrong
4963640	4964760	however
4964760	4969400	He and his audience have actually built an echo chamber where they're not challenged
4969720	4974760	And because i'm somebody who consistently shows up in his orbit and challenges him publicly
4975480	4977720	Um, I think his audience really doesn't like that, right?
4978200	4983180	They his audience have in their own way become the same snowflakes
4983800	4987320	I hate I hate saying that because it but it is true the same snowflakes that like
4987880	4995080	Left wing left wingers were you know, five ten years ago where they didn't accept any dissenting opinion. They didn't accept any sort of um
4995720	5001240	of disagreement and they just get irrationally angry and attack the person who's making the um
5001880	5006120	Who's making the opposite point? Yeah, the opposite point. Yeah, who's having either opinion?
5006280	5011800	All right, a lot of right wingers are finding themselves in this sphere now now to arch's credit
5012120	5017000	Arch is somebody whose audience definitely acts like v's but arch himself isn't like that
5017560	5023080	Arch will actually accept other points of view and he'll like he'll he'll uh, wait does v not accept other points of view?
5023720	5024680	um
5024680	5027240	Like we well here's the thing. We have civil conversations about it for sure
5027880	5034760	But they definitely don't don't really go anywhere the conversation with arch do the conversation with v don't don't really wow
5035160	5037160	They have bash in his friend's life
5038120	5041160	No, because we bashing it's not the same thing as bashing
5042280	5046600	None of this means that I dislike v or anyway, okay. I'm just going i'm just saying let me see. Let me see
5047000	5049000	You haven't missed anything else. I've been checking
5049800	5051320	Yeah
5051320	5053960	I pay attention to the chat unlike you v is good people
5054040	5057960	I'm pretty far removed from his from this echo chamber aspect if it really exists, of course it exists
5058680	5060680	Of course it exists. Hold on here. I'm gonna show you this. All right
5061640	5064600	Here this is not articles we've gotten to the first shut up
5069640	5072280	It's vee nova, it's the first one
5075640	5077640	Okay, hold on
5080680	5082680	Okay, here we go, yeah
5083320	5085320	Got it. Okay, so
5085560	5093160	An epistemic bubble is a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out perhaps accidentally so
5093720	5095720	an epistemic bubble uh bubble is when
5096680	5104360	Bubble is when like you believe in an idea x because everyone that you see around you also believes in idea x
5104600	5108360	You go on social media. Your entire feed is just idea x you turn on the tv
5108600	5115080	It's all idea x you just so idea y you don't believe in idea y because you're never exposed to it, right?
5115960	5123020	And then an echo chamber is a social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited
5123320	5129320	So an echo chamber is when everyone believes in idea x but as soon as you encounter idea y
5129880	5132040	You don't actually deal with idea y
5132680	5135160	You simply discredit the source that it came from, right?
5135480	5142760	So if you were to walk up and say to the echo chamber say hey, this is idea y they don't actually
5143400	5144520	um
5144520	5150200	They don't actually debate with you over the merits of idea x versus idea y they say hey
5150840	5156440	You're you're a bad faith person. Therefore. I won't even consider your idea or or oh
5156520	5161240	That idea came from an institution that I don't like. Oh, that's obviously biased. We can't trust them
5161480	5167080	It's attacking the it's attacking the source of the new knowledge because it doesn't fit with your current worldview, right?
5168280	5172120	That's what's going on. Don't you do that sometimes? No, sure. No, okay
5172200	5173000	Yeah
5173000	5178360	In instances in which I have in the past i've tried not to do that and do that do that recently like here's the thing
5179160	5180200	I don't like vosh at all
5180200	5185240	I think all of his ideas are bad, but this idea is bad because vosh said it is a poor reason
5185720	5189240	For it being a bad idea. Okay, right you have to have a reason outside of that
5191560	5196680	Five dollars from arnimas i'm telling you yeah arnimas you fuck you came back for that
5197480	5203080	Also lives in dev's walls and no walls no, it would not help because dev would like that too much fuck you
5203080	5205080	I don't know what you're saying, but fuck you
5206360	5209640	You do do that dev no, I don't so here's the thing like when someone says so
5210040	5214600	To use the obvious example, we're not going to go down a rabbit hole right when someone says something positive about trump
5214840	5220200	I don't be like that guy's a fucking right winger. He's obviously fucking like I can't trust him like no
5220200	5223720	No, i'll be i'll say okay. I'll look at the evidence. Let's take a look at it. What does it say about trump?
5223880	5228440	I'll read through it. This doesn't make sense. Okay, here's here's why I think this is wrong like it's not just
5228840	5231160	Attacking the source of the information because you don't like the outcome
5231560	5237480	It is actually examining what is there and saying oh the actual content itself doesn't hold up a scrutiny. That's the difference
5240600	5244280	This is because people keep calling you bad faith, maybe you shouldn't be calling other hypocrites by adopting hypocrisy
5244280	5250600	Oh, no, no, no, here's the thing. I will I will just spitefully be a hypocrite towards hypocrites until you fucking stop
5251080	5252760	Simple as that
5252760	5257800	Okay, cool. Let's go back. Nope end of conversation back to the switch 2. Yes
5258600	5259800	exit
5259800	5261800	Good boy
5261960	5263960	You know what?
5266120	5267800	Okay, so
5267800	5269240	anyway
5269240	5274920	Taiwan Taiwan's economic daily has reported a new rumor regarding the hardware specs for the nintendo switch 2
5275800	5281020	The sources mentioned that the console makers ready to launch the new switch this year in 2024 as per market expectations
5281740	5284000	However due to constraints such as global inflation
5284540	5289100	The new product will retail for a hundred dollars more than the switch will be four hundred dollars to get it rather than three hundred dollars
5289180	5294060	Which was the switch was three hundred dollars in 2017. There's been some inflation. Okay, that's just kind of how it is. Yeah
5295100	5297100	Sfo entering his trolls remorse phase. No
5297660	5301580	What the fuck? I don't regret any any of the trolling that I did before trolling is fun
5302700	5305340	Uh, ethan largest ten dollars tbsw. You can't be the same way on certain things
5305420	5307980	I've seen you not respond to points that seem valid when you'll respond to others
5308140	5311340	Feels like you all both have his habits and degree, uh, no and here's why
5311980	5315820	Um, there's just a practical reality of how many comments I can respond to right?
5316220	5321260	There will always be good arguments that slip through the cracks because it's a random chatter or a random commoner
5321340	5323420	And I can't read them all and I can't respond to them all right
5323740	5330620	It's just that's just how it is. But like when i'm sitting across the table with v and we have real disagreements. All right
5331340	5337260	He might send me certain certain points and i'll be like let's examine these. Okay, and okay
5337340	5341420	Here's why I think this one's right. Here's why I think this one's wrong when I send v my points
5341660	5348060	He tends to say I don't believe this because of the source that it comes from not because of what's actually said in the argument
5348220	5349820	That's the difference. Okay
5349820	5352940	And again, none of this is a slight against v. All right
5353500	5355500	We're still friends. We're still we're still good
5357020	5361020	Uh five dollars even dozen walls. Thanks for explaining comes with echo chamber. Could you explain it again more slowly?
5361020	5363740	I'm, not sure my poor wall brain can take it really
5363740	5365740	Yeah
5366300	5370620	Basically an echo chamber is not only a place in which you encounter one idea
5371020	5376060	It's when you attack the it's it's when you attack the legitimacy of other ideas rather than actually dealing with them
5380380	5382380	Okay, so
5382780	5388060	Here's the specs of the switch 2 the nvidia t2 t 239 processor. What is that?
5388060	5390060	Oh
5390140	5394940	It's always gonna say oh, yeah, it's it writes a tegra. Yeah, because tegras are like they're they're uh, they're tablet chips
5395500	5397260	Okay, it makes sense
5397260	5398140	um
5398140	5400540	Eight gigabytes of memory. That's that's not very much
5401580	5402620	like
5402620	5406060	Computers have 32 64 128 gigabytes memory now. Like why does that only have eight?
5407100	5409100	64 gigabytes of internal storage
5409500	5415340	This seems like even for like a switch like this is what you'd expect a tablet from 10 years ago to have even for us
5415420	5416780	Like hold on
5416780	5421260	Well, maybe they fucked themselves over already that is not true apples ghost
5421980	5427260	You are saying inaccurate things about me and kind of proving my point what i'm saying. Okay, hold on switch
5429260	5431260	Switch ram
5432380	5435340	Okay, the switch has four gigabytes of ddr4 ram
5437660	5441660	This one has eight switch internal storage
5442620	5444620	So
5445500	5451980	32 gigs that's not 64. So it is an improvement but like I would have expected maybe 16 gigs of memory
5452540	5454540	maybe a terabyte of storage like
5456060	5459580	Considering how big games you're getting nowadays. Yeah, it seems like not. Yeah. Yeah
5461020	5462460	My pc has 128 gigs of ram
5462460	5468300	Yeah, like all my pcs have 64 gigabytes of ram and 64 is more than enough for almost everything you have to do nowadays, right?
5468940	5469980	um
5469980	5472780	My the one that I buy next will have 128. Yeah
5474540	5476300	Um
5476300	5477500	like it just
5477500	5479500	These are phone specs. Yeah, like
5480380	5482380	I was calling you condescending
5485660	5487660	Well do it again in a super chat
5490540	5492540	Yeah, this is not enough
5493340	5498460	I think I think the chat's agreeing like this is not enough dude. Well, I guess nintendo is just following its pattern
5498700	5504940	Maybe one good console one bad. Maybe yeah, I mean like like I have a fairphone four
5509420	5511420	Fairphone four specs
5514700	5516700	Display yeah, yeah. Yeah
5517660	5521260	Memory 128 gigabytes six gigabytes of ram
5521260	5523100	Um
5523100	5528860	No, no, this is um, six gigabytes of ram and internal storage of 128. So like my phone has more
5529340	5532060	More internal storage and roughly the same amount of ram. Yeah, like
5533820	5535660	Well nintendo's dumb
5535660	5537180	This is this like
5537180	5539500	I understand making an underpowered system. Yeah
5540140	5546060	To put it out at a lower price. Yeah and work in other interesting things instead. Yep. I understand that. Yes
5546220	5548460	Even for that even for that this is too low
5549260	5553180	Like I think this needs to be 16 or 32 megs and this has got to be like
5554300	5558060	10 times the storage. Yeah, like it's this ain't working man. This ain't working. Nope
5559180	5561660	Do you believe is what he does because he and his family lived under
5561820	5564460	Costco or I can't I can't pronounce his guy's name. I know who he is though
5564860	5568780	And knows how bad socialism can get that's all true cjr like I agree with you, right?
5569020	5571980	But this is why like this is why i've been telling him he hasn't accepted this logic
5571980	5576220	But i've been telling him this whole time the difference is between our societies, right?
5576460	5581900	He lives in a low trust society and you know, the the liberal capitalist democratic west
5582460	5584460	Is not a low trust society
5584620	5586620	That's the issue, right?
5587180	5592380	Which is why they're different he keeps falling back and making the joke about it's like a race thing or like an ethnicity thing
5592380	5593420	It's not
5593420	5595420	It's it's it's a cultural thing for sure
5596140	5599420	Ernest fowl five dollars common in ten cuck at hell. Thanks, man
5600140	5602140	You fucker, uh
5602140	5604380	Jiggy calzone five dollars dev in your echo chamber comment
5604380	5608220	One thing that concerns me is seeing right wing forms slide into the same tree to spiral destroy the left of course
5608220	5611340	Yeah, it's gonna happen. It's it's not possible for it to stop it at this point
5611420	5613420	The right wing is gonna go insane. Of course they will
5614140	5619740	The right wing will cobble itself into a fucking rampaging monster that'll just consume itself from the inside out just like the left did
5619900	5624140	Read brian's comment. No, not brian's. Where did it go? I lost it
5627660	5631340	Shit there it is. Nope, which one x that one
5632220	5638860	Zero consumer the psi only has 16 gigs of ram ps4 had eight gigs of ram. Yeah. Okay. Well, then maybe it just needs 16
5639420	5641420	Okay
5643420	5649580	Okay, let's move on because this is coming out actually they've been saying there's gonna be a nintendo switch probably in january february
5651500	5655100	What are you doing scratching everything you're not supposed to crack don't complain about me cracking my knuckles
5655180	5657180	You're scratching your whole fucking body. Get out of here
5657660	5660140	I forgot to moisturize last night. It's not my fault
5663020	5665900	Lol at dev thinking we still live in a high trust society

5724860	5729340	He wants to stop the left. You want to find what's true generally? Yes, and that is the difference between us
5730460	5734620	I think that if your ideology is not aligned with the truth, it will inevitably fail
5735180	5739340	Doesn't matter what whether you have power or not doesn't matter if you're on the left or the right or whatever
5739980	5741980	Truth should be the goal
5742620	5743900	So let's read it

6042700	6044220	So he picks up

6056700	6061900	It was me and like five other guys all just got up and it's like she clearly can't fucking handle this
6062380	6065020	So we like we all like grabbed him, right?

6071900	6073340	right, but

6076460	6080620	There's like five of us and we all just like grabbed this dude and we like we prevented him from throwing the desk
6081420	6086140	And I was like listen, you gotta fucking calm down man. And what do you think like he didn't even get carried out
6086780	6087980	by like
6087980	6091260	Police or like like other teachers and nothing basically we calmed him down
6091820	6096940	And then he stopped and he just went back to where he was sitting and we just kept going with class like crazy
6097020	6099020	Nothing fucking happened man
6099420	6104700	You and dave have these like crazy school stories I always hear crazy school stories from other people you want to know the most like

6131340	6133260	That like nothing actually happened like he was hurt a bit
6133260	6136380	But like there was no like it was not as bad as it would have been with just a single pencil
6136540	6136700	Yep
6136700	6140460	The other one was also an elementary school where me and a whole bunch of the guys got on a rock fight
6140540	6143980	And I was the only one who actually had good aim. So I hit a guy in the eye. Oh, dude
6144620	6148780	No, he was fine. The worst part was that he was my neighbor. Naomi had the tutor up approve her. Yep
6149340	6151820	Yep, because this one time in band camp
6153180	6156220	Apparently she's actually really mad that people keep quoting at her whenever they see her
6156700	6159900	Like she's well, well like she was she was like like 19 or something

6162380	6166140	Yeah, and people interrupt her and like say it. Yeah, and she's just like the whole thing
6166300	6169980	Yes, the whole the whole thing and they're like, she's like, please stop. I have my kids with me like you need to stop
6170780	6174860	You're only supposed to say the save for work version in front of the children. Jesus
6175740	6177100	Okay
6177100	6179100	Oh, let's see. I'll just scroll back up a little bit
6179820	6180700	Okay
6180700	6185260	Five dollars from our most foul dev that is your subjective opinion of the things I bring you your conclusions are wrong on many outcomes
6185420	6187420	Looking predicted hillary would win
6187980	6191020	Did you predict that? I don't remember I might have way back in the day
6191900	6197180	I mean, yes, i've been wrong before. Yeah, of course. Not everyone is 100 but the issue ultimately
6197820	6199020	is that like
6199020	6201020	okay, you and I have had this conversation but like
6201420	6203420	If you say something with no proof
6205020	6207340	And then in the future proof comes out
6207900	6214140	That actually does prove what you were saying initially, but you had no proof before that doesn't actually make you retroactively, right?
6214700	6216780	It means before you were guessing
6217980	6223980	And yet you guessed correctly, but you didn't have a reason to think that though. That's and like that's that's just
6224760	6226140	rationality
6226140	6231100	You know like you you can you can guess things and have that guess end up being correct
6231500	6233500	That doesn't mean that you had a good reason to guess it before
6234380	6240220	Because you're always going to forget due to due to selective bias all the times when you guessed and you were wrong, right?
6240220	6242220	Okay
6242620	6244140	That's why I always say hey
6244140	6249020	Wait for court wait for documents to come out wait like wait for the ruling wait for if there's if there's indictments coming
6249020	6251420	Wait, wait, you read the indictments like always say wait for these things, man

6345100	6346460	Uh, you know that it could be five dollars. Thank you
6346460	6350540	All right dev say I want to debate a point of yours or another what terms and criteria to show you this person is being
6350620	6352620	honest and legitimate what's the thing like
6353740	6357500	I'm, i'm not saying that v or even as fans are being dishonest
6358220	6360220	the issue is that they don't have like
6360860	6362860	proper thinking methods
6363900	6369180	They don't have good thought no, no, no, no, it's not the thoughts that are bad. It's the
6369980	6372940	It's the methods by which they come to their conclusions
6373580	6374300	Like
6374300	6379180	Can't think right ergo bad. No like like rationality is definitely an art form
6379580	6387340	Like you have to understand like what makes a thought like grounded in reason and what doesn't right like good thoughts good bad thoughts
6387660	6392000	No, not good. I'm not talking about good or bad. I'm talking about reasonable versus unreasonable

6401180	6403180	Ten dollars arnold's foul. All right
6403260	6409900	I'll pause it an idea for ten dollars. Thank you conservative bedrock world views are more capable of predicting outcomes in current events than liberal world
6409900	6415260	Views dev is bad at predicting outcomes of current events. Okay, so artemis if that's what you say
6415820	6417820	when I say for example
6418940	6421680	It looks like based on the evidence provided
6422220	6428320	There is a decent chance that trump is going to be convicted in the documents case specifically
6429120	6432400	Is that in your opinion a good or bad prediction
6433760	6435760	Assuming that you've read the documents indictment
6437280	6439280	What do you think
6440720	6442720	Um, i'm giving him the chance
6442720	6444800	Uh, well, listen ten dollars. Thank you, man
6444880	6448880	Crazy school story bully in school broke off the blade of a paper cutter attacking their kid with it

6484400	6488400	Holds there for five dollars. The difference is naomi honor killings are insubstantiated in their culture
6488400	6492560	While random killings in the us are apparent freak things, you know what I will actually give that to you holsonator
6492720	6494720	That's what I said. You just got mad at it
6495360	6498320	Because you said it in a worse way. Yeah, I said insane femoid

6516000	6521040	Let's see a wisconsin woman was remembering a former boyfriend scouting his body parts of various locations was sentenced to life in prison
6521200	6522320	without parole

6523520	6530560	Wait sha business. What a last name 25 very 2020 of shad therian. See I was right bad prediction
6530640	6532640	I can predict the future. Oh
6533120	6534240	okay, so
6534240	6535440	you think
6535440	6537440	So so artemis, what do you think?
6538000	6540400	Will come out of the documents case for trump
6541360	6546960	What what what is your prediction regarding specifically the trump documents case? Give me give it to me. Let's get it on
6547680	6550560	On fucking camera on recording right now
6551120	6553920	So so we both have our predictions down. We'll see where it goes. Okay?
6555120	6560500	Because I think I think there's like a decent chance. He will get fucked with this indictment
6560660	6562660	Okay
6563620	6564660	Okay
6564660	6569620	Silence was definitely, you know, she uh, pleaded not guilty and I could present mental disease or defect
6569620	6571620	But the jury found she wasn't mentally ill
6571860	6573540	Yeah, she huh?
6573540	6578740	She smoked meth. Oh, dude, i'm gonna fucking behead you it turns out being on meth in the basement of therian's mother green
6578740	6580100	But it's okay
6580100	6584980	Strangled decapitated dismembered left the party branch throughout the house in a vehicle wild dude
6585780	6587220	wild

6591460	6593460	What do you mean by that hold center?
6593540	6596740	No, no, they are that's why I support a cab. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know
6598420	6600180	Anyway, yeah
6600180	6605700	Yep, she discovered her son's head in a bucket in the basement. Oh my god. Imagine fucking discovering your son's head in a bucket
6606740	6608740	Oh jesus
6610260	6614420	No fight someone in court hold on she attacked her attorney why
6614420	6615860	Why
6615860	6618340	She was sentenced. Okay. She was sentenced
6619300	6623940	And she attacked her attorney. Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I don't want to spend my life in jail
6624980	6627060	I want to attack you because you said you I wouldn't
6629220	6631220	That's yeah, that's fucking insane dude
6631780	6636340	Blonde five dollars. I said you weren't reading him. So I came to youtube. I was answering answering my question
6636420	6638420	Also, why don't you pretend that you like me?
6639540	6643780	Listen I appreciate the donations but blonde because you are a gaming stream viewer
6644740	6646740	I do like you of course
6646820	6649380	Remember the time that name we defended this woman like two minutes ago. Yeah, I do
6650500	6655460	I did not defend her. I was defending life from doves bad takes
6656580	6658020	Okay, no
6658020	6660100	No, we're still on this article. Yeah, jesus
6661300	6668740	This guy this 15 year old got high in unknown drug punched the 60 year old teacher gave her a severe medical injury. She was uh,
6669380	6673860	Taken to the university of cincinnati medical center where she had her skull cap removed to prevent damage from swelling. Yep
6674420	6680260	The police then found the alleged attacker in the school's career center lobby who was apparently hallucinating had a self-inflicted head wound. Oh my god
6681860	6683860	He's he's fucking losing it dude
6684100	6688660	He was taken to the hospital and then to hamilton county juvenile detention center on a charge of felonious assault
6689700	6692100	And the school was investigating the incident honestly to be honest
6692180	6696020	But 15 year old is on drugs that hard they probably should be in juvie. So that's yeah
6698100	6702740	There's no current threat to the school community it seems to be like an isolated thing. Yeah, but still like
6703860	6707620	The fuck are you doing kid making bad life decisions the fuck is wrong with you?
6708420	6711860	Jesus you already read that. Yeah, i'm just looking up not allowed
6712900	6714180	Okay
6714180	6716740	teen arrested in federal terrorism probe
6717620	6719620	What? Okay
6719940	6722020	This guy I don't know if this is in the article. I did look it up
6722100	6728340	This guy is the son of a prominent attorney. Okay, um leaders from the city and federal law enforcement on monday
6728740	6730260	Announced that a 17 year old residence
6730260	6734360	And that's the 17 year old resident of western delhi has been arrested and charged a part of federal federal terrorism investigation
6736020	6741400	The juvenile was taken into custody by fbi swat officers at his residence in the winefield section of philadelphia
6743060	6749700	Um investigation led by fbi joint terrorism task force which includes detective details from president from philadelphia police department is active and ongoing, okay
6750660	6756180	I think me too dev even though I watch more dave solo streams because I like watching entertaining people. Fuck you goes in your band
6756820	6757940	Uh
6757940	6759140	Rsm 10
6759140	6761140	It will evaporate into the ether
6761460	6764420	If trump doesn't win outright due to how poorly the prosecution has been ran
6764420	6768740	He will appeal until he wins in november and then the case will be dropped after okay, so rms actually here
6769140	6772580	I'll agree with you on this partially, right if trump wins the election
6773300	6777620	In november, I think these cases will go nowhere. I agree with you on that
6778340	6780660	If trump loses the election in november
6781380	6785000	I do think he will probably um, he will probably be prosecuted
6785400	6787000	He'll probably be
6787000	6790360	He's not going to win the documents case, I think all right
6790600	6797160	the other cases like you mentioned artemis file the georgia rico case is now in question because they discovered some weird shit happening with one of
6797160	6798280	the uh
6798280	6801640	With one of people they brought onto it. So that's true. That seems to be true as far as I can tell
6802040	6807880	So maybe the georgia rico case falls apart possibly right the documents case. It seems to be dead to rights
6808840	6812840	But if trump wins in november, it might not matter at all, right?
6813240	6815640	So i'm saying if trump loses
6816360	6822360	The election in 2024. He probably also loses in the documents case. That's my prediction. Okay?
6825480	6827480	Let's get it on record
6829160	6830840	Okay, so
6830840	6836600	the district attorney's office has charged the juvenile with weapons of mass destruction criminal conspiracy arson causing arson catastrophe attempt to

7342040	7346920	Make sure you guys follow all the safety rules of the shooting range and then people didn't follow the safety rules of the shooting range

8076860	8080220	Like caretakers of people who suffer dementia are actually like
8081020	8086540	Terrible people which is unfortunate. We totally live in a high trust society, right? This is happening in the uk
8086860	8087580	All right
8087580	8088300	No, seriously
8088300	8093260	the uk has serious problems with immigrants like bringing in low trust immigrants like the uk has problems that um
8093820	8098540	The uk and like continental europe has problems that america and canada do not have right now
8099020	8105500	And to simply transplant american or canadian politics to europe is stupid because they're facing different issues than we are
8106700	8107740	um
8107740	8110780	It's the same type of camera millions of viewers have seen actress. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah
8111980	8113740	When danielle viewed the footage several days later
8113740	8116700	She said it broke my heart the capture of the people who should have been carried for her most
8117340	8119900	For her most mocking miss wall and pinching her face
8120540	8122880	Much of the footage their grandmother was naked and confused
8123900	8127660	So took the evidence to the care home managers the care quality commission and west midlands police
8128220	8131580	Three of the four workers were from an agency and one was a permanent member of the staff
8132300	8133180	Yep
8133180	8135180	Damn, dude
8136540	8137740	Fucking hell
8137740	8140540	Dev reacts to this and not the children directly to all of it you fuck
8140620	8140860	Okay
8140860	8147260	I I want to point out that I think that dev has this habit of when i'm reacting really poorly to something that he acts
8147340	8152060	More positive than he's necessarily feeling at the time. Yeah, and that happens a lot. Yeah
8152700	8157260	Because you're having a rough time of it. So yeah, you know, you can just react poorly too. It's okay
8158540	8162940	Eight care workers are charged for it with abusing miss wall, but only four of them are found guilty. All right
8163340	8164300	What
8164300	8168940	So these two were sentenced to four months in prison because the ill treatment and willful neglect
8169500	8172140	These two were found there since six months and four months
8172940	8178860	They should be charged for longer the fuck. It's the uk and they're saying oh, they're just they're black and innocent
8180780	8182780	Fucking ridiculous, dude
8183580	8185580	Okay
8185820	8189900	The last of us knockoff game has been removed from the switch e shop. So look at this
8190460	8193820	This is the last hope it's very clearly a last of us
8196940	8197580	All right
8197580	8202940	The game appeared on the storefront last week where it was quickly highlighted on social media being a knockoff of sony's the last of us
8203260	8206540	And the game has been removed from the e-shop and trailers are being taken down by youtube and sony
8207740	8210380	Uh, neither nintendo or sony commented on the matter
8211100	8215420	So this is apparently the worst game ever. Okay. Can we see this video digital foundry?
8215420	8217420	Okay
8218300	8221180	Okay, let's see the video wow
8225500	8227980	The last hope on nintendo switch is the worst game ever reviewed
8230140	8232140	Does look pretty shit
8232220	8236060	Doesn't the switch have like an didn't you get all that like malware or whatever? Yeah
8236700	8243180	The switch is a really bad like moderating system for like what games constitute as actual games on their shop
8245580	8247580	So, let's see, yep
8249980	8254780	This is the game guys, would you rather play this or the last of us the last of us
8258140	8261260	I'd rather watch bakar again than play this game deal
8263980	8265980	Oh, can we just can we just not
8267100	8271980	Like here's a comparison and it's like well they look the same don't they?
8273340	8275340	Jesus christ
8275420	8277420	Yeah
8285980	8288460	If I can find it we should try it no
8290060	8292060	No
8292700	8297020	Yep, I mostly ignore shovelware infested digital storefronts and assume many of them are innocuous
8297020	8302540	But you see something like this. It really pulls back the curtain the depravity festering within certain corners of the industry. Yeah. Yep. So
8302540	8304300	Uh
8304300	8310700	The game is developed by west connection limited and uh, the last hope dead zone survival is the most is their most blatant copy
8310700	8317580	Another game so players who have purchased the last hope dead zone survival can still play the game on switch and still redownload it
8317900	8319900	But if you try to find it, you can't buy it anymore
8320460	8325340	Good. I kind of wish I had a copy of it god. Shut up. I'll try it. It looks shut up. Shut
8326300	8328700	Up, really? It's a piece of lost media now
8329580	8334960	What what what are you getting mad about you and your stupidity
8336140	8343660	I'm not stop playing super bad fucking shovelware games or wanting to that is not a good trait for any
8344220	8348380	Sane person to have listen, it's still better than last was too. No, it's not
8349420	8351740	I would rather play last of us too again 100
8352460	8357100	This is the the thumbnail guys women will suffer diarrhea forever
8357100	8360220	After osm pick caused a horror bowel injury

8366380	8370940	Okay, well that that makes sense but diarrhea forever. Yep

8396700	8401120	Who are suing the maker of the blockbuster weight loss drug over claims that left them with crippling stomach paralysis?
8402300	8409180	Novo, nordisk the maker of osm pick and wago v is facing lawsuits from patients across america
8409580	8413900	Who say they experienced extreme side effects, which they were allegedly not worn about
8415980	8418380	Thousands more patients have also come forward to claim
8418380	8423420	They suffered adverse reactions to the drugs and attorneys say many more could join the glowing legal campaign
8423580	8427420	Is this going to be one of those things where some people will randomly get a check in the mail being like?
8427500	8429500	Yeah, we got sued. Here's money
8429980	8431980	Why do you like this dev?
8433020	8438700	Most of the parents most of the patients claim they suffer from gastroparesis, which is the massive name for paralysis of the stomach
8439340	8443900	The condition which can be life-threatening can cause a buildup of food in the gut and symptoms of nausea vomiting severe pain
8445260	8450400	A daily mail reviewed more than a dozen lawsuits filed since november by patients who are diagnosed with gastroparesis
8450860	8456960	After using osm pick and wago v including some who suffered life-threatening bowel injuries and faced lifelong consequences
8458140	8464460	In all the lawsuits novo nordisk is accused of failing to properly warn about the risk of gastroparesis in the drugs packaging
8464620	8467340	Why would you take something that might like do that to your stomach?
8468300	8470220	It's fucked up
8470220	8474140	She was hospitalized for four weeks had a gallbladder removed. Oh fuck dude. Well, that's not bad

8480940	8482700	ever enough
8482700	8487200	At least 10 lawsuits have also been filed against eli lily the maker of monjaro
8487420	8492460	A diabetes drug which works in a similar way to osm pick and wago v and is also prescribed off label for weight loss
8493420	8499420	Eli lily is also accused of failing to include proper warnings about monjaro's risks. Wait, how did that happen?
8499500	8501900	You have it stuck on top chat again. I don't know
8502540	8504460	Shouldn't have
8504460	8506460	I changed already. I know
8510780	8514060	In one case a woman who used the drugs claims she was diagnosed with gastroparesis
8514380	8518060	Which caused her to vomit so much her some of her teeth fell out. Jesus. That's a lot of vomiting
8518140	8520140	Well that actually happens to people who have bulimia
8520220	8525580	Yep, right. They just they vomit so much so they don't have teeth no more. It just acid acids them down. Yeah
8528380	8535020	Another one was was diagnosed with a life-threatening bowel injury after using osm pick and underwent surgery which lasted nearly nine hours
8535580	8539020	Doctor said she will be in pain for the rest of her life. He'll never have a solid bowel movement again
8539100	8541100	That's actually really sad. Wow
8541420	8544640	A third case brought by a woman she was diagnosed with severe gastroparesis
8545180	8547900	Was hospitalized with symptoms including going a week without a bowel movement
8547900	8553260	More than 40 cases have been filed in federal courts across america fucking wild dude

8635260	8640060	Obviously who co-owns bar pm with chad wick who is chad wick is the guy
8640860	8644060	Chad wick got these fucking names, dude
8644700	8647280	Chad wick got his police custody

8655500	8661020	Pence says the police officer who ran into the bar told him that he swerved to miss a dog in the middle of south broadway
8661660	8666860	Pence says he does have security camera footage of the crash though. He's not making it public at this time
8667900	8672460	The police department did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment this morning. Okay. Well, hold on
8673420	8674780	wait
8674780	8679020	Pence who lives above the bar said he was getting ready to head to bed as two people down
8679500	8683680	Two people close up for the night suddenly felt the whole building shake and ran downstairs
8684140	8689580	He came to find the police suv in his building and an officer demanding to see his id
8691020	8695500	Why pence said he replied no, you don't that's a police cruiser in my building
8695820	8697820	You don't need to see my ideas and how this works
8698140	8700640	Pence says he was spun around in place in handcuffs. Jesus
8701660	8703660	You think the officer was drunk or something?
8704380	8706300	That's what it sounds like
8706300	8709900	Tara shavank or two hours. So I crashed into your dear god
8712220	8715980	Pence's co-owner wick was taking videos and photos the police vehicle when according to pence
8716380	8718940	Three of the officers went for him. He raised his arm and they said he hit him
8719580	8722220	Pence was eventually taken out of cuffs. Wick was taken by police
8724060	8726940	In addition to cleaning up the damage pence some other morning trying to locate wick
8726940	8731660	He later found that wick had been taken to the south patrol police station then the slu hospital for medical attention
8732140	8734940	He was taken to the north patrol and finally an unnamed was a central booking
8735580	8739500	Wick whose legal name is chad morris. Was that a term of felony assault?
8739900	8743740	Oh, okay. So maybe he like tried to fight the cops after the cops crashed into his building
8744700	8748860	So they're getting him with assault but the cops crashed into his building
8748940	8754860	Yeah, but the proper the proper recourse that is to go to court, right? I mean, listen, like look at this shit like okay
8755420	8757500	Something was up with that cop who crashed. Yeah
8758860	8760860	He was probably drunk and he probably like
8761420	8765660	Like all those cop other cop buddies to be like look fuck i'm drunk. I did something stupid. Help me out guys
8765740	8767740	Yeah, so they're right. Yeah, that's probably that fuck
8768300	8771340	Jesus. Yeah, that's the game and the officers are based
8771340	8773340	Yeah
8773340	8780540	Dude next article. I just love the idea of we're taking out the gays drive into a gay bar get out sort of arresting people
8784540	8790860	Yeah, it seems like the police are probably like fuck here yeah, no, no the problem is they're probably not fucked they just are bad
8792940	8794940	All right
8794940	8797820	Please file felony charge against okay. It's the same article
8798460	8800460	No, it's not
8801020	8806140	Yep, he's facing a fella. He's facing felony assault against an offer. Mr. You're resisting arrest. Yeah, see
8806860	8808540	yeah, so
8808540	8812540	So so chad wick began to scream obscenities in the wake of the collision
8812940	8816860	The officer writes that he then struck me hard in the chest with an open hand causing me to lose my balance
8816940	8819100	So basically lose your balance because you were drunk
8820060	8824220	he he so he attacked the cop who drove into his his his
8824780	8830060	This is the uk, right? No, it's it's in america. Okay. Well either way, dude, you fucking drove into my business
8830060	8831420	The fuck is wrong with you?
8831420	8836860	Yeah, so so you attack you attack the cop who drove into your business and now you will and now you have
8837420	8840620	You're getting charged but like this is stupid. I agree. Some of those things are like
8842140	8844380	The correct way to deal with police is like you can't just fight them
8844540	8849020	I know but you have to like document and you have to be cool and like if if they're wrong it will come out later
8849180	8851740	Like you can't do this or else you'll just lose. I know
8852540	8857580	I know but this is still stupid. Oh, it's stupid like they they're very clearly like in the wrong hand
8858940	8866220	Wait, hold on. Yep. The attorney for bar pm says that bystander video contradicts the police account good. So let's see good
8866700	8873420	Videos taken at bar pm contradict the police story. You know, what is actually probably good that he kept it private until you know, yeah
8874060	8876060	This is embarrassing for the police department. Let's see
8877580	8879580	Yeah
8879580	8882940	Multiple videos of the collision and this aftermath tell a different story than when police are alleging
8883420	8886140	And showed that morse's arrest was unwarranted. Yep. Yep
8886940	8890940	See it's one of these things where like yeah. Yeah, you have to like document and record and keep cool
8891020	8893020	Because you make things work for yourself. Yeah
8894860	8896860	Okay, let's see here what is the
8897020	8899180	20-minute bystander video tells his own story
8899180	8903900	They unlawfully handcuffed him the falsely claiming speaking loud. He's against the law. These are pretty good domestic warrants. Yeah
8909580	8911180	Yeah, man
8911180	8917420	So at no point in the 20-minute video shows more striking an officer in the chest. Yep. Yep
8918380	8919180	Yep
8919180	8924380	Lord cameron says the best way to deal with the corrupt system is through the system dude. There are so many instances
8925020	8926460	of people
8926460	8927660	like

9709900	9711660	I just want to say one thing
9711660	9715660	The beginning of my speech was edited cut out and I didn't know about it. I want to read it
9715980	9722800	History isn't history anymore. Truth is not truth. Even facts are being replaced by alternate facts and driven by conspiracy theories and ugliness
9724460	9726460	Yeah, so
9727420	9731100	Basically, he gave the speech at the gotham awards. What is the gotham awards?

9755580	9758380	Wow, and he's mad about it. I mean to be honest I probably would be too
9758940	9760460	I understand
9760460	9764380	It's really funny. Like this is hilarious, but I would also be very angry if I was robert
9769740	9776860	He attacks the weak destroys the gifts of nature and shows disrespect for example by using pocahontas as a slur wait what based
9777740	9778860	Wait, what?
9778860	9780140	he
9780140	9782560	Called elizabeth warren pocahontas
9783440	9791520	Because lizabeth warren claimed to be native american on her university enrollment to get like special privileges, okay, but she had um
9792880	9799040	Like almost no native american budget less than me. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so we called it pocahontas. Yeah

9806640	9807840	become
9807840	9812320	Known on the left as a slur because trump used it as a joke and now it's considered a slur
9812640	9814640	so
9815360	9817360	Okay, yeah because well the idea is like
9817760	9825360	The idea of a native woman who who ends up in like liking a white man and adopting white customs and blending into white society
9825760	9827180	They call them

9836000	9838240	Yeah, so he was cut out
9838240	9840240	Oh
