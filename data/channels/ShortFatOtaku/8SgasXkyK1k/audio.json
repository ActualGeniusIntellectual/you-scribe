No No from the sip let's try to get ahold of nowadays she's very busy. All right, Peter. Fuck you are done If he does third chair, thanks for the $2 Fuck.

So I was working all night on that long video I would like to fire up a tune extreme or something like some sort of make it up to you guys stream If I do that, it'll be late at night though. It'll be the late stream Because I want to because these these things I just listed off the discord the new discord the the tik-tok Tuesday And then the new script they're all priorities, right? so this the the The tune extreme will be maybe probably not But it might be a bonus surprise if I can keep it together then why mention it Why not just have it be a surprise. So like I like laying on my thoughts. Okay $5 from our nose following Naomi and Louis has never been hurt on the same stream together quince I think I think you have I think you came in and likes talking to the Michael little hose on the stream once Yeah There was there's definitely been at least a couple of times were like Somebody yelled a question at me through you and then I answered through the mic Yep Coming tricky Mario, I'm doing my best but hey If for some reason I decided to turn this channel that this channel into just like a fucking stream channel, it's my business Yeah, but you're I've always taken the opinion that I'm just gonna do whatever I want Yeah, I know but your actual thought out videos are the better videos. Yeah, maybe yeah, that's no no, maybe Fact Zonta $5 coach red pill Russian spy and Propagandist has passed from pneumonia Of course Carl's who's Carlson and Don Jr. Who's Don jr. These people with the mentor Russian propagandist passing away I should do a video on coach red pill to be honest because I mean At that he's dead. He's not gonna be relevant ever again from this point on like he's fucking he just died so if I have a bunch of um, I have a bunch of Coach red pill stuff saved up from the internet blood sports days. I might as well drop it So fuck it like not now is the time to make a video on coach red pill No, he's a fucking asshole he was an asshole back then he's an asshole now It's been like four or five days already Another we have to wait a week till you found out then make news Yeah, that's how that's how the niceties of the world work hmm It was apparently from neglect Yeah, I heard like he he was in a Ukrainian prison because he was living in Ukraine Spouting Russian propaganda getting paid with a Russian. So of course, he got fucking arrested He's like what a retard right but even if you agree with Russia, like how dumb can you fucking be, right? Don't live in Ukraine during a war with Russia and then spout Russian propaganda on the internet. Yeah, it's no so he Gets you actually didn't you try to like hop the border into Hungary or Poland or something and he got arrested at the border So he was put in a prison and the prison sucked and he caught pneumonia Well, he was in the prison and there the conditions were just so poor He just fucking died good to know that prison conditions all over the world are the same He was also a spy when he avoided prison the first time and riding up the five spies he was working with fucking hell Dude, I enjoy about $20. Thank you that video better mentioned liberalism self-destructive nature demand You fight with the hand tied behind your back fact that defies your rule doesn't the reflection of your rules just because we're better That will be actually a different conversation. I'm talking about philosophy not necessarily practical implementation But I do agree with you there So basically, um, yeah, I have a lot of things I want to do today Oh I'm Speaking of the discord. Yep. New there's a new discord being built because the old ones a fucking trash fire new discord coming soon I'll make sure to announce to people Shouldn't you say that because of discord's new rules that to discourse new rules as well Yeah, well no cuz like discord's new rules means that the new discord server is gonna be a lot more like it has to be stricter Yeah authoritarian Like most anything that dev has ever done I have to because discord's like Discord will fucking ban everyone on a server if someone on that server misgenders like it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah, it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah So fucking awful, so I'm making a discord, um, what else What else is really important to talk about? Oh So I haven't been talking about this anywhere else, but I have been talking about on the weekly sip So I'll talk about it again here Thank you very much. Derek. Appreciate it Glad you enjoy. Um so I Did finally decide to try vyvanse? Oh Yeah, I've been talking about like okay. I didn't realize you were talking about it on the set good to know but only in the set only only sippers know and And here I'll give you my vyvanse take okay one it was way too easy to get Considering that it's basically controlled meth. Mm-hmm. I Feel like anybody sufficiently smart enough whether or not they think they have any sort of condition that requires vyvanse can simply walk in fake it and get it because I I had a Bottle like I went into the fucking The the clinic I had a bottle of vyvanse within an hour. Yep. Congratulations That is the same drug as I don't know how much destiny takes yeah, but it is the same drug. Yeah You know, I'm gonna feel real stupid if I ever go to the doctors and I'm just like hey Maybe I should try this and they're gonna be like yeah here and I'm just like I should have done this like Yeah, I won't just go cuz I'm lazy and I'm also not as smart as you So I might not get it Like I was talking about after I came back home I spoke to Taft edge for a whole bunch because we were talking about it now. It's just like, you know The best way to learn how to lie is to watch Death Note, all right To learn how to not lie like Light Yagami who makes all these fucking crazy ass faces anytime he's lying Like when when Light Yagami lays out his thought process for lying He'll say okay You need to adopt a personality of the person who is innocent of the thing that you've actually done Yeah Which might mean in some instances implicating yourself in some way because that's what an innocent person would do right So yeah, of course I was at the crime scene I just walked through cuz I was walking there like I walk there every day, you know Like do something like that right where that's how you lie effectively is You even if it means you you you hurt your own case in the short term You you have to present something you have to present a false Psychology that is consistent with a person who is actually telling the truth, right? So That's a really good tip on how to lie, right? And so when I was like sitting in the doctor's office and I was like I Was thinking about it I'm gonna lie about maybe Felt like, you know, it felt like I was lying when I was laying it out because here's the thing if she asked me to like You know focus on something for 15 minutes as part of a test And if I and if I couldn't do it, then I would be given the drugs I could definitely focus on the 15 minutes So I did feel like I was lying almost like everything everything that I filled out in the form was completely true But it also felt like it wasn't even though I knew it was like it's like, okay Well, do you do this behavior? It's like yes, I do. Do you do this behavior? It's like yes I do like I was checking them off checking like yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, I do Right, but it also felt like a construction It felt like I was constructing the personality of somebody who was actually quite ill. Mm-hmm. You know, I mean, yeah Well, I mean that's the problem with like being able to have good days and bad days, right? Like you're a competent enough person that you can actually go to the doctor to get shit You need to be fair to me took me five days to actually go to like I suppose go on Monday No, I know but like it's still the fact that you can force yourself to go You're not like a person who's like stuck like in a home like who's like actually Helpless and can't force themselves to do anything. So it's definitely a what's that called? I'm gonna read this super chat. Okay, sure. No, no, I'm done. That's fine. What's that called? What? Okay, well there you go I knew you're done okay here in the lead of Columbia Thanks for ten dollars When things James Lindsay makes clear is that any response against the left has to be measured and well thought out Because like because the opponent's reaction is the left's goal like in Spain or Argentina Um, yeah, that's true. That's definitely true for sure. I agree Hi food drops. Oh My grandfather was a b-17 tail gun in World War two. He passed away r.i.p. Dude. I'm r.i.p. Grandpa Dev hasn't seen code geass. I've been trying to convince him to not yet. Sorry. It's really good You should watch I think I saw like a first episode with a long fucking time. You should watch all of it It's really good. Yes, you gotta lean in more Stop okay. So basically basically like It's one of those things where I would say before vyvanse, I Hey Jew lady, what about the tunnels? Have you got tunnels underneath the house yet? No. Maybe if it was like, only our house Someone else was in the basement. Yeah. Okay. So here here, let me try to lay this out real quick. Okay, so Basically, I would say before vyvanse I I had what I would call a sufficiently productive day about 30% of my of the time That's not about right. I yeah we're like a lot of days I'd be trying to do work and I just I'd be forcing it and it wouldn't be happening or I do way less work than I should or I'd like do other semi-productive work that wasn't essential like cleaning the house or something, right? You know what I mean? And there has been some difference Since it's been four days, so there's not gonna be a fucking crazy difference yet, right? And also I'd say watch gundam. I already watched gundam. You're at a really low dose, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So here's the thing I was given a 10 milligram dose for the first week and then a 20 milligram dose after that right and so Basically with the first week I was given a 10 milligram dose for the first week and then a 20 milligram dose after that Basically with 10 milligrams um Dom said it was a uh, it was a child's dose, right? Which makes sense But also here's the thing like on the one hand vyvanse doesn't like alcohol So it doesn't like it's not like you need more because you're heavier. I'm a fat guy, right? It's not like that, right? So it'll affect the same amount no matter what but also High blood pressure is an issue for me because i'm overweight and i'm out of shape, right? And there definitely has been like oh same No being overweight enough shape you can be out of shape and overweight, okay. Yeah, you definitely can yeah. Oh, well, yeah Okay, I guess never mind. Yeah, never mind It's called being thin fat. Yes winter wait winter dev is the laziest stuff. Yeah. Thanks for two dollars, man It is kind of winter and summer dev are the same dev. Are they? Yes. Are they really? Yes Yeah, so i'm so here's the thing i'm still on the initial like ramp in week where the idea is the doctors Okay here i'll give you one week of 10 And then like a month and and like six weeks or something of 20 and basically this will be like the trial where like The 10 will ramp you up and then the 20 will be where you stay. I mean like dom's on 30. Um, I don't know where what? I'm, pretty sure that's common. Yep. Sure. Yeah Did I say something I should have said I don't know everyone forget what I just said the point is The point okay food shops show feet jesus. Okay. The point is Is that um, i'm still in the ramp up period but I have noticed like a little bit of a difference But it's not like you know when you get high Hold on you wouldn't know no Lots of people report getting high and they feel it in that not just in their body, but in their mind Lots of people get drunk and they feel it not just in their body, but in their mind, right? Yes I've never felt any drugs in my mind. That's because you don't take drugs even when I have Only my body whenever like I i've definitely like had enough alcohol to be considered drunk before and it's only ever and it's only ever affected It hasn't affected how I think it's only been like oh jesus. I can't fucking move like anything properly But my brain's like pretty much intact. Um and um Same with same with weed right where it's like but you've done like once I've done both these like a handful of times not very much though. It's been like over 10 years before It's only it's been like over 10 years So I expected that there'd be some sort of effect On vyvanse And there hasn't been I think the exact same way People who are like people say like listen if you take adhd medication, you're gonna lose all your creativity. That doesn't happen now, maybe If I get more which i'm going to it might as if if the dose goes up I might yeah It's only been a few days. I think you need to like actually take a longer time before you form an opinion Yep, it's very true. Um, however At the same time I have noticed that my twitter binges when I go on them They don't last three to six hours anymore They last about 15 minutes and then I get bored of them and then I go do something else And it's actually no longer. It's like oh I can just stop this like oh, I don't I don't it's no longer appealing to To reply to this fucking retard Right, yeah, because you're not chasing that dopamine maybe Anyway, we'll see I mean, I guess I just started so who the fuck knows right? Yep You're in your mid 30s all your career creativity is gonna anyway nah, that's not true i'm still pretty creative I mean, what about those like musicians that are still like still going like 70 plus still making new music. That's actually good so And also like another a side effect of it one is high blood pressure So I need to keep it and I need to keep a start working out more. I need to but also Another part of it is yeah, I've got like fucking once every two weeks right now the the other the other part of it Is um It's not attention span. It's it's not actually affecting my attention span. It's affecting my ability to drop a negative feedback loop of reinforcement That's what it's affecting right? So like every tweet on twitter is like another loop. It's another cycle And getting the next tweet is always like when i'm arguing with somebody It's like the next reply the next reply the next reply and it's all and each one is its own reward Like i'm talking about like psychological reward, right? Yeah, well, I think it's more serotonin, but whatever either whatever happy drug. Here's the thing. You're using dopamine in the meme way I get it. Okay, so but basically Um, it gets to the point where it's like Like for example, lots of people with adhd They'll like hyper focus on like a video game for 18 hours a day, which I have done before right? And it's because video games have this reliable reward pathway where like you're always Attracted to the game because you're because you're getting steady You're you're getting steady advancement through work in the context of the game So like every time you do something in the game It takes a little bit of effort and you get a little bit of reward and it's the steady feed which is like which which is Extremely appealing to people who have adhd, right? um But also if you're sat down to do something that is very intellectual and very tough like writing for several hours that can be harder and i've definitely been in days where it's like I need to write this and I fucking can't get myself to do it because I can't like I can't fucking do it, right? Um So the fact that I was able to like I was able to write just out of fucking nowhere. I was able to keep My mind on the task of writing this giant script that ended up being an hour and 20 minute recording Like a couple days after taking these pills like oh, maybe I can actually do do some of these things now Um So here's okay. Yeah, and also i'm sad that I don't know the tune to that song so I can't sing the super chat Song of touch I'm out of shape i'm out of air, but my blood pressure is sky high fat rolls high You know how to touch I know listen, I know out of touch but like not off off on the top of my head Now listen All I know is i'm out of touch and that's all I know really in my head. Yeah, okay Thanks lady. Columbia for the five dollars So here's the thing I actually agree miss sparkles like so so on the one hand like I I genuinely have the adhd symptoms. I generally have The adhd symptoms Where i'm like i'm like I went down the list and I checked it off and it's like I do actually do this I do actually do this. I do actually do this check check check check check, but then like The fact that I came in extremely knowledgeable about the drug and its side effects, yep I knew exactly what to say. I already knew what form she was going to give me to phillips. I found it online And I already like I knew what to say. I knew how I knew how to how to behave I had it all pre-planned in my head. So it felt like I was faking it Yeah, that's because you make yourself sound like a fucking scammer. I already knew what to say I researched everything I did I did I did I did it doesn't matter if the doctor might have said something else because I knew Let me put this way I went in so knowledgeable about the topic That it felt like I could just drip feed her information about myself, which I did To direct the conversation making yourself sound better to direct a conversation To direct the conversation towards an end point that I wanted that was the correct end point But nonetheless, I was the one who was in charge of that entire conversation. The doctor was going where I wanted her to go You make yourself sound like a scam artist and I was just like well here's the thing That's why I felt like a scam artist you make yourself sound like a scam artist that makes sense Yeah, this is not imposter syndrome. This is just dev being a scammer even though he needs the drugs Everyone does this and they know it. I don't do that I just go to the doctor and be like I am not knowledgeable about this subject and you are because you took eight billion years Of school for it. So tell me what to do So here's the thing like a lot of people in the chat are saying like this is a bad idea dev you shouldn't be medicating You should be able to do fair enough, right? Here's the thing like if I go on these drugs for a month and they make me worse i'll go off and i'm like Oh fucking like i'm not i'm not like devoted to I must be on the drug. Look I want to try it. So i'm trying I mean like that's that's the way with like antidepressants too like sometimes for some people it takes like Like so many tries with like each antidepressant to like actually find one that doesn't fuck them up Really bad it fucks them up in the right way. Not the bad way Yeah Dev goes in age management when we get the trucker video based One more day. Okay, you can re-up my bad neuroscience takes if you want next house, that's fine Also, hey next house. What's up? Listen, that's what information yeah, I know food shops. Okay here listen guys food shops isn't real really trans. All right Food shops is the kind of person who watched way too much like sissy hypno Porn and and like looks at way too much like like futa hentai All right, and she completely psy-opt herself into becoming a girl. Okay. Yeah Like I know I know everyone's going after food shops for the loli thing right now, but the real deep lore The real deep lore is that food food shops is agp. All right, that's the jesus i'm trolling by the way Oh, no, listen, I know I know the doctor here shit i'm actually well aware but i'm just saying that I don't like Do all the research and make myself feel like a scam artist when I need something from a doctor Luke says food shops did nothing wrong giga chat Okay, so here Yeah, let me put it this way. Okay guys, there's a lot of people Who say um that this is not it's not a good idea for me to uh for people to go on meds including me And you know what? I like Kind of agree. Here's the thing because There's definitely a way there's definitely paths where like through enough meditation And through enough like mindful. No, don't roll. I'm not doing giving some hippie bullshit All right, like people change their behaviors all the time through self-improvement Listen just because you fucking can't don't oh, yeah Don't you say the fucking man who's just like I want to move in like two years after we started dating I'm gonna lose all this weight and get my fucking eight pack It has how long has it been it's been seven fucking years you got even fatter and we were still in the same place Yeah, I don't want to fucking hear your rules about oh anyone can just as long as they like do this and this ever No, sometimes you just fucking need the medication to take that step to get you there. It's very possible. Yes. Yes. No, that's the truth Sometimes you know, not everyone does because they have wait, let me explain what i'm gonna say you fuck Also, hold on a lot of this is also your fault. That's why we're still here too. Yes. Yes Okay, okay. Do you want to actually start airing shit on the fucking stream now me? No, then stop Don't fucking just start pulling real life shit out when I I have so much I can say with you I'm holding back so much right now. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yes makes you a bad boyfriend for holding back when you when you're not Okay, I won't do that then now me you fuck Listen, i'm not the one giving a bad take about fucking shit like being hypocritical about myself I didn't even finish the take you don't even know what's bad yet or not. Can you please yeah, but I know you know what? Shut up. Shut your fucking mouth Shut up Okay here Okay here here let me put it this way, okay, so there are definitely paths for people who let's say They get like let's say you take like like an addict who like someone who's addicted to like league of legends or something, right? Someone who like definitely will spend eight or like overwatch like 18 hours a day on overwatch and just like lose their fucking mind Because you don't lose your mind unless you lose well, no, yeah But like at the end of that 18 hour League of legends or overwatch binge and you like turn the computer off. You don't feel good. You know, yeah you do if you rank up No, even if you rank up like there's like a hollowness to it where you're like if you rank up it's good No, no, you fucking Degenerate listen, all right. You're definitely like when you like Get caught in some sort of in some sort of like cycle of perpetual reward Even if you Get more wins than losses. You still feel like empty and burnt out after you're done right do it. No balls Thanks for the fiber Artemis, but you still feel empty and kind of burnt out. You're like, uh, you know like you're like, uh, It like there's something there's something there That like just it feels like like you fried your brain almost Doing like like spending that much time on something because it's just been constantly like feedbacking you Um, you never played good video games. I'm sure I have I Dude, can you hold on you never you've never been able to like relax enough to enjoy playing a game for 18 hours So when I was like a kid or like a teenager This effect that i'm describing did not exist for me Yeah, I could sit there for 18 hours and play a fucking video game and just be like, yeah But like in my 20s, that's when I started to feel like oh, I that's because you were supposed to be doing other things Yes, well, no, it's not it's not the fact that I have if i'm gonna sit around and play a video game for like all day on my day off I'm gonna feel absolute terrible by myself. No, you're only gonna feel bad about yourself You're supposed to be doing other things even if I had nothing to do Let's say that I was like a billionaire Okay, and I had nothing to do and I could just sit around for 18 hours a day playing a video game I would still come out of that being like, oh that's a bit too much only after one day of 18 hours or multiple days Of 18 hours, you know what probably like I do it once in a while and feel okay but if I was doing it like Every day or like multiple days in a row. I'd be like, nope. See that's understandable. Nope. That's a bit much Uh, so like but here's the thing you kind of get caught in these feedback loops these um The these neurological cycles where like you're you're getting like the next dopamine hit constantly, right? You get caught in that and so you're looping and looping and looping and looping and looping Right, you use the phrase earned dopamine 18-hour gaming system versus finishing a roof makes sense Yeah, but I don't even know how to start a roof. Thanks you. Thanks for 20 dollars, man There's definitely like, uh, here's a personal problem. I'm talking about a personal problem. Thank you for three dollars, dude um, so like here here, let me let me try to let me try to try to The weight the bad gut bacteria tones for a lot of mood brain issues tons of research on it I should die before you're trying that farmer crap. Oh, don't worry. My dad's actually a lot better recently sammy for sure Oh, and you know what? That's another side effect of the fucking Drug is my appetite's rat like is decreased by quite a bit rapidly. Uh, yeah, dude It's actually day one day one. My appetite was down and it's been down ever since yep. I'm like, oh I could just not eat What do we had today? I've had one piece of avocado toast and I feel like Not hungry, but not full. I feel like satiated. Yeah. Yeah I can't tell if they need any issues meds or not. Maybe i'm just poor on self-motivation or need less caffeine So can I answer this? Okay, go ahead. Okay, so the actual way to be able to tell is that if you can't get yourself To do the things that you know, you need to do Like for a really long like if it's been like if you're just kind of noticing these symptoms attempt to try self-discipline And if self-discipline works great, but if it's been like many many many years and it's just like oh, well Maybe i'm just poor at self-motivation Yes, because you need some pills to help you out. Maybe maybe to help out your self-motivation just a little bit This is like years years of notice. There's there's there's there's one weird trick you can actually apply. Okay? Okay If you drink coffee, well, no, I make the avocado toast myself. Like we make it here We don't we don't spend twelve dollars for like delivery avocado toast. It's cheap to make at home We make we make it ourselves. Okay, so If you drink coffee and rather than riling you up it calms you down Then you might actually like be you might there's a decent chance you'll respond positively to adhd meds Because coffee is a stimulant, but it has always calmed me down and like made me focus Well, isn't that what coffee's supposed to it's just coffee's just supposed to wake you up But Naomi you drink it and like bounce around and jitter Because i'm not awake beforehand just because you wake up and are actually perfectly able to like go and do a task and i'm not It's different They're having these effects on day one. Well next house I didn't I didn't I didn't even get to get a chance to finish what I was saying Because the chat and Naomi pulled me off multiple tracks regard regarding the dosage I'm seeing minor effects And they are ramping up over the course of the days But the first day I felt almost nothing um Actually, I also fucked up my first dose, too So if you take vitamin c with vyvanse the vitamin c neutralizes the vyvanse and I took like a fucking 500 milligram vitamin c tablet the same time. I took the vyvanse. I didn't know It's fucking funny dude i'm like wait nothing happened It's like oops But no like like things i'm actually Happy with how things are ramping up Because I am noticing like yeah, i'm able to log off twitter more i'm able to not waste so much time on nonsense I'm able to do more writing. I feel absolutely no need to go snack in the kitchen whenever i'm bored like A lot of things have already changed and it's quite nice Um, so i'll probably stay on go take grape juice with your drugs. I'll probably stay on the regimen that I have right now And if after the after the trial things need to be changed we'll change them if not i'll just yeah Here's the thing right you'll just start taking actual death it'll be fine. Oh, yeah, sure the other thing I wanted to say though is like A lot of behavioral stuff Theoretically can be changed through good habits and good willpower however Responsible use i'm keeping i'm on make it very clear responsible use Of a prescription medication can often just get you there. Yep That's supposed to be the point of like Stuff like this is that it just lets you live like a normie instead of your your secretly depressed self well, it's funny because like Like dom described it as getting her to baseline. Yeah, but I don't describe this as getting me a baseline No, I describe this as getting me over baseline Yeah, and which is why another reason i'm like maybe maybe I actually did just make it Well, no because like the problem with like adhd and autism is that it's such a fucking wide spectrum of so many like differing Every symptoms and everything is that well for some people it might just be like yes Now you're at the baseline can act like a normal person for other people It's like now I can just actually focus on tasks and that's all I needed. Yeah so so for example like, you know is it A feedback reward problem when you're like addicted to a video game when you play for 18 hours and you feel terrible afterwards. Yes But it's also a habits problem And with good habits, you could actually overcome that and however, it is like a completely uphill battle to have somebody who's already predisposed To engaging in those bad behaviors to build a good habit that allows them to resist those bad behaviors You can do it, but it's not a battle Well the the ideal the ideal use for for drugs like this is to get on them So that you can then build the habit and then even if you get off them the habit remains because you've now Because now you have behaviors that are reinforced through just daily routine and not simply Uh a drug of some kind it's kind of like using stone staircases to get to level 100 of the skull caverns in stardew valley Instead of just fighting all the monsters and finding a hole the meds are the staircases. Yeah And the thing is like there is some virtue in actually fighting your way to that point Because you can then say like I actually did it like it's a it's a character thing I know you don't agree with me, but I think I generally think that there is sure there's stop taking the meds right now dev Um, actually build the good habits that you've been saying you needed. So here's the thing even though you just chastised me for For uh being stuck in in the mud for a couple of years. Here's the thing I've gotten pretty far Without any sort of help More than most people. Yeah, and i'm proud of you for that Yes, well, but wait, why would you be proud of me? Hold on if you don't believe no no If you don't believe that there's any virtue to be found in getting through something based on your own willpower and your own efforts Then why would you be proud of me for doing for doing as much as I have? I'm proud of you. Oh Because you know that i'm right i've never proud of you for anything ever again Nope, never mind So Come on I was trying to be nice Don't be nice to dev ever again. What do you mean? What do you mean? But here I appreciate you being nice. No, but okay. I just want you to tell explain it to me Um the fact that you can still do work Okay, you know what? No, I cannot explain this. I want to hear it. Listen, I can't explain this well enough But thank you for the two dollars. It is pretty good for me so far I will take the mental note not to be nice to you anymore But I what why I do not have the vocabulary at the moment to explain myself Dev's debate brain rot is strong to be honest. We actually do I think that actually is a problem on my end is like You'll you'll say something and i'm like Namely, that's the complete opposite thing of this thing that you said like three fucking weeks ago that I remember like with pinpoint precision You're like what the fuck and i'm just like yeah, I mean, how come you're consistent and you're just like Fuck you I do this a lot and it probably is a problem on my end. Do you think I don't know? Do I I don't know do you I don't think about anything Dev do meth and beat nooms Dev doesn't understand women But anyway, yeah like it's one of those things where there is virtue if you can Get there yourself But the people who are very puritanical about it and they're like you should therefore you should never actually like you It's like no no fuck that like if you go on drugs for a couple years and then build a bunch of good habits Then go off of them and those habits maintain and you have like a good life Like what I don't see a problem with that. You know what I mean? That seems like it's it's good. It's okay Uh, what do you think sure Okay, listen just because you're currently mad at me for really bad reasons Yeah, doesn't mean it doesn't mean that you you can just not reply on the fucking show. I did reply. I said sure I'll also pay more attention to the chat than you because they deserve it. So you know what? I got breast implants because of foreign. Wait what food shops really? I mean, why not breast implants are good Dev is doing meth. Yeah giant tips like I know like meth is the meme but vyvanse isn't exactly meth. Yeah And things are doing actually, okay. You know what like it's I I you know what let me put it this way Okay I am starting to see uh certain improvements They are ramping up. I'm liking where this is going But if like if things go wrong, i'll stop but right now I actually feel pretty okay The only downside is that I had a heart attack a couple days ago, but that's fine. We'll just get we'll just get through it Nobody's giving me like a weird look did you no i'm joking Oh That's what you get for being mad You get trolled Hi, i'm dev and I make jokes low But i'm gonna make it a totally straight tone and then just wait to see if people realize it's a joke Even though I know it doesn't sound like a fucking joke Jesus fucking christ I'm, so fucking done with you I've only been up for like two fucking hours. I'm already tired of being alive Five dollars, I didn't have a heart attack. We're joking five dollars Five dollars from lives and dev's walls. Thanks very much. Doug said he couldn't make it He told me to tell you your butt also. Hi newms. Hey lives and dev's walls. Come comfort me Okay We do a little troll I I did figure out though that like there actually is there can be heart issues if you like Okay, one if you have already high blood pressure like I do because i'm a fatty and two if you have your high blood pressure One wasn't even that bad. It was only a bit higher. It was it was it was higher. Yeah only a little Okay, hold on. We literally had this discussion in the car with dave and dom Okay, I don't know. What should your blood Pressure be Should be between 90 90 over 60 and 120 over 80 Okay, high blood pressure is 140 over 90 or higher low brush. Okay, so yours was 130. Okay It literally takes you right there. Okay, let's see Yeah so I had Hypertension I had high blood pressure stage one hypertension. So it's like what between 130 and 139 or 180 89 so like I had that doesn't say 180. Oh, sorry 80 and 89. Yeah, so I had One I think was 130 over 100 Okay Which is definitely considered to be high blood pressure, but like I said, like it's high It should be lower but you're not in a danger range yet. Yes. That's what I just said. Yeah. Yeah Thanks rock So, yeah like because my blood pressure is Already higher than normal. Um, they're like listen, you can take the vyvanse However, it does come with higher than normal blood pressure So you got to keep a watch on it like take get some blood pressure tests if you start to again If you personally hit dev out Thanks for the two dollars So wait if since it's two dollars does that mean I get to hit you twice? No, okay It's five dollars. Can I hit you twice? No, what about ten? No, it depends on the message. Okay So basically, um I have to like measure it Because i'm already kind of over like out of shape. I have to measure it constantly and I will lose weight. Yes, but also like not eating as much will help but they also said like listen do not have coffee Around the same time as you have yeah vyvanse Yeah, because one the coffee will actually neutralize the vyvanse the same way the vitamin c does but if it doesn't You'll be hit with like a double dose and it'll like really fuck you up And I might have had I might have had um Coffee at one day. I think I think I had coffee too close to the vyvanse So I was like I was like, oh I was feeling it just for a minute Wait an hour is what I have to do. Oh titanium. Are you on vyvanse? I didn't know that I didn't know that wait an hour Yeah I mean, that's what I did.

Oh, is that his dog that's so cute boop Boop to the dog snoop Yeah, because here's the thing milo had I will in a minute. I just want to see their book. Okay Milo is a right wing gay guy, which I still don't understand in america, but okay Yeah, he wrote this in 2017. Yeah, because like he went through like several several iterations of of his career and right now he's gone through, uh He has voluntarily gone through conversion therapy and he claims that he's now just fully straight lies, obviously He's just like every other republican politician who's having sex with young boys on the side and now he's like trying He's trying to play up like how he's this. Um He's totally this completely reformed straight man who's fully christian and he looks like a fucking Unironically like a fucking meth addict like he looks completely like strung out, right? Well, maybe he actually is strung out Maybe maybe but this was written in 2017 when he was still on the rise and wait is milo. He's not american What no he's um, he was greek who moved to britain at a very young age Then he moved to america, uh when he was older. Ah, okay Well, I apologize to the americans in the chat. I obviously offended No Yeah, milo went through like several cycles of like just relevance and fading away and relevance and like he's got he's reinvented himself several times And it's all been retarded Milo fell off so hard. Richard spencer is now higher than him Yeah, like I saw that destiny milo debate like six months ago and milo looked like a fucking wreck. Okay, you know, okay milo looked like What ken looks like? Who? Ken in the barbie movie when he has like the two pairs of shades and the big fur coat Like like that's funny, but milo actually looked like that and he's like I look good But he also looked like he was fucking like high on drugs the entire time. I'm like jesus christ. Milo. What the fuck? So he doesn't look this cute anymore. No, that's unfortunate here. Hold on. So like Let's see milo That's just the milk Come on, but just search up his last name. Jesus. You don't even have to spell it. It's right there. It's right there Damn it, you fucking boo. Okay. So like yeah, this was like milo 10 years ago Not that cute all right, and No, yeah, like his moments, right like he's He's like justin beaver. He's He's definitely like kind of made a name for himself being like A twink even though he's right wing And he kind of went through several iterations of it, but now milo in 2023 Like Yeah, he fell off hard I do well I think it's also because he doesn't look that great with blonde hair yeah No, just like like a lot of this a lot of this go back go back. I don't fucking know Why is there a pacifier? I don't know in that woman's mouth, but here compare this right like this is when he was like He was young. He was still gay. He was hot. He was still right wing. He looks like a pop song. Yep Not a singer a pop song pop song but like compare that To this and the problem isn't just aging Like eight there's aging present, but it's not the the problem isn't just aging It's also that he's completely transformed himself into a completely unlikable person when at least before if you hated him you couldn't deny yet style You know what? I mean like Yep, damn Even with the bags. He's still hot. Yeah like he just he just I don't know dude milo really fell off Hold on like here. Can I see all he needs to do is dye his hair back dark. It'll look better Okay, i'll i'll pull up the the video at least okay Like yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, like what are you doing buddy? He doesn't look that bad. He's also hair isn't blonde so he looks better. Oh, yeah Well, it's also like the things he's saying and how he's like like he's jittering around he's talking He was never like this. He looks like he's he's not even fucking present. I don't know. I'm only judging him by his looks to the crazy gay man talk Yeah, okay. Sorry. I I didn't share the screen. I'm sorry. I forgot. Okay, there's a card though another card Uh from dapper tengu. Thank you Another spicy book for the sfo library put it between mine camp and on the jewish question to get those twitter retards and both sides howling lol Thanks, dude. Oh number sign. Listen, I am very aware about how how unattractive I am. So I know so fuck you number sign It's like like here's the thing everyone has to get old right not me everyone has to go I want to live and be young forever bullshit. You're already old Everyone has to get old. Okay Everyone will eventually lose whatever physical appeal they had in their youth That is it Even if you stay in good shape throughout your 30s and your 40s and your 50s one day if you're still alive You'll be a hundred you'll be a big old bag of wrinkles and that's just how it is. All right But There's a difference between like aging gracefully and looking pretty good for an old person versus Like being fucking madonna, okay Kilometers matt for the five dollars. Thank you. Hey dev. Just want to thank you for your political insight I felt alienated as a black libertarian your class and your style of classical liberal ideas fit. Well, thank you very much, dude Um, i'm not a libertarian though, but i'm glad that you at least uh, enjoy my uh, my content. So thank you I hope I hope it you it helps you somehow. Yeah, because like here yeah, i'm gonna I will pull this up Okay, well you're gonna actually share i'll actually share the screen this time. Okay. So here, uh, let's see um What was his name? Okay, yeah so like And then i'm gonna pull up No, can we not look at madonna nope, we're pulling it up Okay, so here i'll show you what I mean Okay, yeah, i'll bring it in so Here's pierce brasner with his wife, you know back in the 90s And now like he's aged pretty gracefully. Okay, if they're in hollywood and they are aging gracefully They've definitely had plastic surgery done, but it's been subtle plastic surgery. No, that's not a possible. Here's the thing like okay She's 60. Yeah, and she looks great. She looks good for 60. She does but she's doing great Probably had plastic surgery to help make herself look good. Yeah, and like just fine aside from being part of the hollywood degeneracy Pierce brosons always said like why would I abandon her because she's getting older So am I she you know, we've had kids together. We're a family like I love her like no What the fuck like why should I have some fucking side piece like like this is my family and it's like, okay Yeah, you know fair enough, right and I mean like like he still looks pretty good Yeah, he's hot and she looks pretty good for for being 60, right? Yeah, and then so like like they don't look young anymore is the point but they still look good Silver foxes and cougars are my bread and butter Like they look good for their age. You can't be 20 forever. So it's better to Accept aging with dignity and and do what you can with it and settle plastic surgery and this is the good The good example with subtle plastic surgery. It doesn't have to be surgery. Yes. I'm telling you if you if you can afford Here's the plastic surgery. All right, that's also plastic surgery. So Here's madonna Here's madonna before and here's her now And she looks like a fucking alien. Yep, and like She I think she's also in her 60s and it's like Why would you do this to yourself? You know, what's a you know, it's a better one who's who uh, pull up share Share. Oh god. Yeah, you want to really see the unfortunateness pull up share because madonna You know what still kind of looks the same but it's weird because we know she's old But she still like sort of has the same face and I say sort of Yeah, like if you try to stay young for too long, you just look alien Yeah, but no you need to pull up current share 2023 versus share like 19 20s This maybe yeah like It you it's kind of funny to share actually kind of looks okay there But like you can tell because you can like see the outlines of her cheeks, it's weird That's also kind of a good picture of current share yeah see bad pictures of share fucking no That one's not great neither's that one oh, yep Yeah, like yeah, she's 77 when will I feel old will you keep injecting yourself with the blood of infants? Is that anne boleyn who did that no someone else I don't remember But yeah, man like This is not accepting aging gracefully no and you look worse for it like You're an old lady now madonna it sucks, but that's just that's the natural cycle of life You know, you don't get to be young forever. Yeah, the point is to be a hot old person not a hot Like not an old person who's trying to look young and be hot. You gotta be a hot old person There was actually what's funny is that like I I was with my grandparents and they were like visiting we were all visiting like some of their friends Or whatever and like there was a lady and she was she was super fucking hot and she was like 65 or something and she was like like super thin and she like just all the style. She looked great No, I can't Do you just did no problem Okay, ow, ow, ow, okay Sp elite five dollars. Thank you dev. Your beefs will be over faster. You just stopped arguing so they called them fucking Okay, i've been advised wait, I didn't mean to leave it, but I did I didn't mean to sorry that was an accident Can I delete it? I can't shit. I didn't mean to delete that message. Sorry, so much for freedom of speech. Whoa Okay Sigourney weaver Pull her up dev. Okay. I'll take a look. I'll take a look search google you boomer. I'm gonna add 2023 Yeah, it's gonna be still hot, okay, that's uh, that's pretty good I mean, yeah, she's out on the older right? Well, yeah, she's like an old lady now. Yeah I want Sigourney Weaver to step on my face Really? She looks very old there. Well, that's awesome movie. Yeah makeup So here's the thing, right like People that that guy it wasn't number whatever his name was He said that like you guys are talking people who fell off like this everyone gets old, right? But no listen, we already fell off so ergo we can talk about everyone else Everyone gets older but you don't have to get old just because you get older. You know what I mean? Like Bye sketch you can find pictures of me on the show from 10 years like the gaming channel from like 10 years ago And I definitely look younger and thinner. That's how it is Even if i'm at the point now where even if I lose all my fat i'll probably still look older That's that's just the natural cycle of life, right? You don't have to you don't have to lose your spark just because you get old but I think Chasing youth is what makes people lose their spark in the end. Yes. Yeah So, yeah Okay That's why I tell you not to dress like a hobo I just like a hobo though. You kind of do every time people complain. It's like damn, you know I'm just i'm buying another fucking another fucking pair of shorts another fucking oversized shirt. I am full hobo mode You just said you don't dress like a hobo. I said I do. I know I said I do. No, I said I do You just said no, I don't dress like a hobo and then you just now said that. No, I didn't. Yeah, you did Rewind it. I'd fuck you Um tricky mario for five dollars seeing those images will forever making respect betty white She ate your ice cream just I have a hundred. Yeah, man. She did it. Okay. Also listen. Oh, Kilometers matt for five dollars. Thank you. As long as you hold the classical liberal ideas and hold both heads accountable I don't care for the priority. Honesty is king. Here's the thing about classical liberal ideals, right is They're good, but they're incomplete You can't only be a classical liberal else. Everything just falls apart and it's the main reason why socialists have been undermining liberalism And honestly libertarians have the same problem like here. I know a lot of you guys are libertarian I'm now going to make all of you angry real quick. Okay? um libertarianism and socialism They ultimately pursue the same goals Now they have drastically different methods for achieving those goals and the methods are so different that they are mortal enemies But they're still aiming at the same target. All right, they both claim to desire freedom And they both claim to desire material prosperity and they both and they both claim to desire human rights Now they have very different paths that lead to those goals to those end states, but they're aiming at the same thing Else you missed the super chip Oh, did I let me scroll back up? Where's it? Where's it? I don't know This one compare. I said this one compared to deli parton. I don't know. I said you miss it. I I I I don't know Yeah, deli parton is also fucking like terrible. Yeah, she's yeah Yeah Here goes dev talking no, it's true it's true. Yep, of course, that's true. Yes. How is it not true? It's totally true He's right when you think about the basic president, of course think about it like so if you ask libertarian, what do you want? He'll say freedom. He might even say equality depending at least like equality of access Because you know if you if you um remove monopolies from the market you have equality of access to the market right so freedom equality maybe uh material wealth and prosperity um Human rights, you know, but then you ask a socialist they'll say the same thing Socials will say I also want material prosperity. I also want freedom. I also want rights Wait, I thought but oh no, that's communism. Never mind However, they just have very very very different ideas on how to achieve those ends, but they have the same ends Now if you talk to somebody who Is completely different someone who says I don't want freedom. I want order Now he's actually aiming in a different target, right? so libertarians and socialists they uh And some in some very strange ways they're two sides of the same coin Because they want the same things. They just have very very different ideas on how to get those things If you want to be safe and secure and you don't really care about freedom that is something different yeah, yeah Yeah, see here's the thing here in a leading company. Yeah communism's freedoms are not freedom. It's a here's the thing right that criticism Even though I agree with it That is you simply saying hey The socialist says he wants freedom, but socialism won't give him freedom So you're not arguing over the you're arguing over whether or not the method will get you to the end point You're not arguing over the end point itself. You understand? Sierra 7 10 dollars there are actually a lot of former right-wing libertarians that swap to be a bit more authoritarian because eventually they see How libertarianism can't sustain itself from being undermined by socialists. Yes exactly so a lot of libertarians Either they leave their ideas undeveloped which does happen a fair amount frankly They become more authoritarian over time because they understand that you need some sort of social fabric to hold the whole freedom thing together And that's like I think like dankula is slowly going that way scrump definitely went that way um Or they become more left-wing right and for example, that's kind of how lilith drifted over time So I think like libertarianism Is like an unstable position that reads and that falls in a certain direction The rest is zero two dollars libertarian responses actually leave me alone Oh, there is a coin Oh, there's a uh, there's a cool. There's um Dapper, thank you. Thank you. There's a piranha plant coin in here super mario Oh, thanks very much, dude You can flip this coin piranha plant or logo Not heads or tails actually would this be heads and this would be tails probably Yes, because there's no head. Well, I mean unless you count toad's head on the other side, but it's so small You just dropped it under the desk. I did I dropped it under the desk. Well, it's down there now. We'll get it later Yeah All right, I sent a video of a dude saying that dev has socialism wrong the title says it's for sfo fans Okay, I'll look at it later. Thanks miss sparkles Uh, two dollars real hold center dev. Did you read my ten dollar super? I'm sure I did Surely I did. I don't think we've actually missed any I think I don't think we have yeah Five dollars from those and does walls. Thank you I'm willing to hear arguments, but you need a stronger case than they both want good things The stated and vision looks very different. Um, it really doesn't in some ways, right? If you were to if you were to ask them about their ideal society, both of them will say well individuals can Prosper and be free and flourish and you know, they'll have their idea and but it's all utopian bullshit, right? Um, but also here's the thing when you say they both want good things that presumes that these things are good Right, like you're presuming that freedom and equality and human rights and material prosperity are all good things and for me Those can be good things in some instances and they can also be very bad things in other instances Which is why i'm not on the libertarian socialist spectrum Have you missed five of my bit chats on twitch? Oh, no blonde Oh, you can't fucking insult me by spending one dollar to give a giant fucking paragraph anymore Fuck you Okay, i'll go look at him. Fuck. Okay. Let's see this bullshit Okay Hi, naomi. Yes. Yes. This is the milo book is from before he went full retard I was actually supposed to get a signed copy of his book, but I realized he was fuck's ever put in my address. That's funny Uh, you mean why do you hate your fellow blondes? In some water too, actually, um I don't know I hate everyone equally I could be wrong but the old photo on the right might have been brosnan's first wife who died before he came He became james bomb maybe Maybe so but he has been dating her for like not dating married to her for like years and like decades, you know, so Okay, so Should we actually get on today? I mean it has been in like a full hour. It's fine. We're having fun We're hanging out. You guys don't want to hang out. I don't know You know, you know what would probably be better if Is that we did this and then at like and then you finally get to the articles but after we're done the stream if you are the person that puts in the time stamp of when the articles actually start in like In one of the comments and pin it that's the monster. He does that. No, they don't Hold on Kilometers matt for five dollars. Thanks for shattering my belief steff. I'm now an anarcho-communist demi-queer trans femboy nice based Haha, yeah, the reason that i'm a liberal and not a libertarian is because like there's obviously a place for for government Sometimes there's actually a place for very heavy government intervention depending what we're talking about And to ideologically be committed to the government should do everything or the government should do nothing. I think those are both failed positions Like no, I don't want my co-workers having votes and what luxury goods am I allowed to purchase my personal earnings See good emperor that is again a conversation about methods Right because libertarian says the libertarian will say co-workers having votes and what luxury goods you can purchase That will lead to less freedom But a socialist would say co-workers having votes and what luxury goods i'm allowed to purchase will lead to more freedom So you're disagreeing on method but not on goal the way out of the trap is to understand That you actually shouldn't be advocating for freedom at all times. Sometimes you actually want less freedom Which I know is it's a very bitter pill to swallow for westerners to actually have to understand because Every western political school of thought whether it's liberalism or socialism or libertarianism or even conservatism They all advocate for different types of freedom different ways to get more freedom, but sometimes freedom is actually bad It just depends what we're talking about Yes Well, oh fuck there was there was oh god, I came across a fucking take from some socialist who was like um hot take But if the child's enjoying it and isn't injured It doesn't matter if she can if if liberal society thinks she can she can consent or not Okay, I want that person like to actually that's an argument from freedom because it's about consent And listen, I want that person to be raped in the ass With the cactus it's so ridiculous and then be like, oh well, no you you consented That that person was named food shops No, i'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding If I ever if I had a gun and I ever heard someone say that in real life, I would just immediately shoot them I don't care if I go to jail. I actually would I 100 fucking would this is one of the reasons why I don't let myself own a gun I would kill too many people Kilometers matt two dollars. I'm not that far libertarian. I'm sitting moderate. Okay, here's another like black pill for libertarians, right? Um, I know that you guys like to divide up positive and negative rights But they're actually the same thing just from two different points of view And you cannot truly divide them up and in fact the um The mechanism by which you divide them up Which is basically defining who the who the who the initial aggressor is That only makes sense if you value libertarian principles And if you don't because sometimes there actually is a good reason to aggress upon somebody else if you don't Um, then the whole thing falls apart Uh, but that's I don't know I feel like marty mcfly being like you guys aren't ready for that one yet You guys aren't ready for that one yet Um, let's see I do have news articles we can talk about if you want Probably should you talk about the news articles? You probably should okay Acknowledge me. Hi Nova two dollars from blonde. Thank you.

Yeah, I hate it So bad at everything is this dev this dev's nrx root. Here's the thing All right, because well no food shops will know this because she's been going through the open lettered open minor progressives. Um, The neo-reactionaries have their place in politics. They have good critiques of things sometimes but Their solutions are ultimately um not convincing But they've identified real problems and most liberals ignore those problems by simply screaming you guys are fascists Which is not it's it's not an intellectually satisfying answer Oh, don't don't get it. Wait, hold on sparkles. Listen. No, wait, wait If you send the glitter package send it soon because we're moving soon Okay. Well, listen our place is covered in glitter because for those of you who watch the gaming streams, you know I have to wear a peach dress which I do not look good in but yeah, I think you look good in it But um the thing is covered in glitter and so now there's just pink glitter everywhere all over the house We just keep randomly finding it On everything and I don't even go that many places in the house while i'm wearing that dress so You can but it's already covered in glitter glitter and sparkles Also from dave's fairy wings, which he likes to wear all the time around the house off camera I got into the vents Sorry Put more glitter on naomi and dave.

No, I don't know Here's the thing trump derangement syndrome is marked by people who can't articulate when they don't like trump. I can articulate it very easily It's not like he's orange or he's evil. He's a fat No, like I can actually tell you why I don't like him. It's easy. That's because he's orange and rich. Oh Okay, we should start the articles Throwing a flashback Is it article time guys, it's been an hour article time an hour and 10 minutes. Wait, hold on I need Guys stop blonde. Thanks for five dollars dev. I'm serving for you so hard You better get your knees and call me master. And if I give you one bit you say, thank you massa and you're like Fuck you. Thanks Okay, so uh art was foul I'm gonna call it artemus specifically because he's the only guy I know who might Shut up, I'm not promise not to bring up trump. I never fucking said what the fuck's wrong with you Fucking trump. You just how am I supposed to do? Well, because you're then you let me fucking say it first You you dumbo you're a dumbo. You're a dumbo Okay, hold on are you even still there oh star hawks five dollars dev you're breaking my heart you're going in a bath I can't follow no Uh sierra sierra seven ten dollars. Thank you hot take anorex accelerationists and neo left-wing people are converging towards the same conclusions But accelerations want to make the problem worse. I have no idea what to do. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, i'll do with that Yeah, I can't i don't think artemus is here if artemus isn't here I guess I won't yes don't I guess I won't So it feels bad though feels bad I wanted to articles. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't even much from you fuck. I don't care Some other goddamn political thing and we've been talking for an hour about literally nothing. No, hold on I want to ask artemus what it would take to get one of those fat 100 super chats because he sometimes drops like 100 or 300 dollars before like listen if you play a certain game Or you watch a certain movie or you do a certain video on a certain topic I'll give you a big fat super chat and to be honest I want one of those big fat artemus requisitions because i'm i'm willing to do a video now now that Video now now that i'm all vivanced up I can answer your question now that i'm all vivanced up I can sit down and watch and do a review of whatever the fuck I can answer your question It's called you got to suck his dick more Rather than having your own um I'm back and looked you skipped my sit down or super whatever before you go with the package. Okay, was it? I'll go look i'll go look real quick. Okay. I'll go look before we do articles. Sorry real quick real quick Real quick Stop Your time isn't worth as much as arches fuck you see Gotta suck his dick more. Oh, no Gotta facetime live and make those motions Yep Okay, let's see if we can actually find it Just scroll down until you see ten dollars sierra. Nope. There we go No, I did answer this one. Yeah I think there is virtue in doing it without meds And I think there's virtue in having humility and awareness to take meds if you need them rather than trying the same thing That doesn't work Yeah So like if you can build positive habits such that you don't need the medication you should do that If you do need the medication, then that's also fine, right? Yep. Yeah, I completely agree. That's what I said. See this was my take and you didn't even let me fucking get it out Because you just raged out when I said there is virtue doing it without meds I was gonna say the other half of it and you just fucking lost it. Listen. I all I did was roll my eyes You're the one who reacted No, you fuck That's what happened Maybe he'll do it if you add a dev beg email You fucks You fucks Yeah, actually i'll do it before we start even though it's been like an hour jesus So It's all good holtonator, you know what I think we both might have read it And then like didn't like totally respond to it out loud. Maybe yeah. Thank you for the thank you for all the donations today Um Probably you haven't tried building positive habits. Oh, I absolutely have star hawks. I built a here's the thing I've built a ton of positive habits over the years my habits like 10 years ago were fucking I actually can confirm that dev actually has a lot of positive habits Wrong artemis, but hey, hey artemis, too Yeah, okay So let's let's get on the road on the road On the road again, that's okay. You have a different argument in the chat Okay Well, goodbye partial goodbye chat because now you're small and I can't read you Pop it out make a big I don't need to see the rest of the screen. I want to see what's going on here Why shut up? so Here's the p.o box as always actually when we move the p.o box is up in july Should we just like keep it keep it here for three months where you move it?

Um, yes Thanks So God dev shut. No, shut up. I'm telling him Ah Sp elite for five dollars while dev's typing. That's why I said tds late You're not a sketcho about it, but you do just have the worst takes about him debate sticks about him though He's literally an orange he's literally orange Imagine if we got on the news today, I know I know dagoth I know Okay, hey honey bun five dollars from sp. I already read it. Oh, yeah while you were typing sure god Okay Let's get to the news That is a different thing That's also a fascist newsletter. Listen, it's for research. Don't fucking think anything too late. Don't do it Okay, let's go On to the articles for today Nintendo switch 2 will reportedly feature 120 hertz display. Oh, I sent this to you. Yeah New new details regarding hardware specs for the upcoming successor to the nintendo switch dubbed the switch 2 have been revealed The handheld will feature 120 hertz display So that means that it can go that in handheld mode. It can go up to 120 frames per second, which is way well Most computers run between 20 30 and 60. Um Well, wasn't there more than 60 is kind of overkill frankly, wasn't there that research that you actually can't see over like 30 frames a second Yeah, that was all bullshit. Yeah, that was bullshit if you say so. Yeah, everyone says that but it's like Yeah Yeah, that's bullshit but this is happening hooray, yeah, wait is it gonna look like that no this is just a mock-up Yeah, uh, we're supposed to learn here's the thing people are saying that the switch will probably release next christmas Which means we'll probably learn about it sometime in the next few months So I want to switch I want to say that I was I think I found this on reddit And so I was reading the comments and he was a redditor. Yes so I was reading the comments and people were just like, oh man nintendo never puts out like Anything that's current gen it's always like like it's the power of the ps4 That's been the case since gamecube. Yeah, I agree However, everyone keeps forgetting that this is also a handheld console and it's primarily a handheld console So without having the power of a ps4 the handheld console is actually really fucking cool. Yeah Well this here's the thing. So the gamecube came out and the gamecube was roughly on par graphics wise with the ps2 And the original xbox, yeah, they were pretty much all the same Yeah, um, and then the wii comes out and the wii was not much better than the gamecube So therefore it was one generation behind the ps3 and 360 which were about comparable Which is why the wii didn't get all the multi-platform games that ps3 and 360 did but what the wii did get It had the wii remote and it had the huge install base So people started putting out a bunch of cool things on it then when the wii u came out the wii u was About the strength of the ps3 and the 360. Yep So in the ps4 and the xbox, um, the xbox one came out they were again one generation ahead So the wii u got a few of those ps3 and pia and and 360 games It got a few of those initial entry level ps4 games But for the most part the ps4 outclassed the wii u right now the switch came out and the switch Seems to be more powerful more powerful than the wii u but not by much So nintendo has definitely said, you know what we're not going to go with better hardware We're going to go with other things that make the game The system that make the console unique So we the the wii remote was a success the wii u gamepad was not And the switch the the idea of having like the joy cons are basically just wii remotes But they're much better and the idea that it's both a uh, a handheld and a docked platform Is also pretty incredible. Yeah, right So and also like nintendo basically started A new era of handheld gaming because after the switch success that's when you saw the steam deck That's when you saw like the rog handheld That's when you saw like all these little handhelds were showing up because nintendo proved that oh you can actually have A devoted portable gaming device that also docks with your tv so you can use it in both modes. Yep The switch was a massive success All right So I have a feeling because nintendo's kind of Nintendo has has had this Back and forth with like one generation has been a success one generation has been a failure pretty consistently now for a while If the switch 2 is just the same thing as the switch But with better graphics, it might not be a very big success might not that's fair. I'm gonna get it though I like yeah, read the thingy Mark the cyborg. Hey mark mark. I didn't know All right, actually, I think I knew but I forgot that your girl from his x-ray girl, right? Yeah Um mark the cyborg low target fidelity spec means games which don't cost hundreds of millions to make Nintendo can be dumb, but their dev target philosophy is based. Yes, that's true The only issue is that like when the big multi-platform games come out They're always not on nintendo systems and that can be a problem, right? So like when like what's a big multi-platform game right now? Right now. Yeah Yeah, like if that's not is that even on console? Yeah, is it? Yep. It's on ps4 and xbox You mean ps5 ps5 and xbox? But it's not I don't know the kind of but it's not on switch. It's not on the switch Like before it was like the arkhams the arkham games, right? Those are big multi-platform games The arkham games are now on the switch. I believe yeah. Well, yeah, but they're like they're like 10 years old now Like when they first came out they weren't on nintendo's console, right? Yeah What's the deal with v and his audience seemingly having derangement syndrome towards you? Here's the thing quinn. Um, it's because V and his audience and I am critiquing v now, but we are friends and this is not me backstabbing him I've told him this to his face. We have our disagreements, but we are still good friends v V believes in some things that personally I think are wrong however He and his audience have actually built an echo chamber where they're not challenged And because i'm somebody who consistently shows up in his orbit and challenges him publicly Um, I think his audience really doesn't like that, right? They his audience have in their own way become the same snowflakes I hate I hate saying that because it but it is true the same snowflakes that like Left wing left wingers were you know, five ten years ago where they didn't accept any dissenting opinion. They didn't accept any sort of um of disagreement and they just get irrationally angry and attack the person who's making the um Who's making the opposite point? Yeah, the opposite point. Yeah, who's having either opinion? All right, a lot of right wingers are finding themselves in this sphere now now to arch's credit Arch is somebody whose audience definitely acts like v's but arch himself isn't like that Arch will actually accept other points of view and he'll like he'll he'll uh, wait does v not accept other points of view? um Like we well here's the thing. We have civil conversations about it for sure But they definitely don't don't really go anywhere the conversation with arch do the conversation with v don't don't really wow They have bash in his friend's life No, because we bashing it's not the same thing as bashing None of this means that I dislike v or anyway, okay. I'm just going i'm just saying let me see. Let me see You haven't missed anything else. I've been checking Yeah I pay attention to the chat unlike you v is good people I'm pretty far removed from his from this echo chamber aspect if it really exists, of course it exists Of course it exists. Hold on here. I'm gonna show you this. All right Here this is not articles we've gotten to the first shut up It's vee nova, it's the first one Okay, hold on Okay, here we go, yeah Got it. Okay, so An epistemic bubble is a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out perhaps accidentally so an epistemic bubble uh bubble is when Bubble is when like you believe in an idea x because everyone that you see around you also believes in idea x You go on social media. Your entire feed is just idea x you turn on the tv It's all idea x you just so idea y you don't believe in idea y because you're never exposed to it, right? And then an echo chamber is a social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited So an echo chamber is when everyone believes in idea x but as soon as you encounter idea y You don't actually deal with idea y You simply discredit the source that it came from, right? So if you were to walk up and say to the echo chamber say hey, this is idea y they don't actually um They don't actually debate with you over the merits of idea x versus idea y they say hey You're you're a bad faith person. Therefore. I won't even consider your idea or or oh That idea came from an institution that I don't like. Oh, that's obviously biased. We can't trust them It's attacking the it's attacking the source of the new knowledge because it doesn't fit with your current worldview, right? That's what's going on. Don't you do that sometimes? No, sure. No, okay Yeah In instances in which I have in the past i've tried not to do that and do that do that recently like here's the thing I don't like vosh at all I think all of his ideas are bad, but this idea is bad because vosh said it is a poor reason For it being a bad idea. Okay, right you have to have a reason outside of that Five dollars from arnimas i'm telling you yeah arnimas you fuck you came back for that Also lives in dev's walls and no walls no, it would not help because dev would like that too much fuck you I don't know what you're saying, but fuck you You do do that dev no, I don't so here's the thing like when someone says so To use the obvious example, we're not going to go down a rabbit hole right when someone says something positive about trump I don't be like that guy's a fucking right winger. He's obviously fucking like I can't trust him like no No, i'll be i'll say okay. I'll look at the evidence. Let's take a look at it. What does it say about trump? I'll read through it. This doesn't make sense. Okay, here's here's why I think this is wrong like it's not just Attacking the source of the information because you don't like the outcome It is actually examining what is there and saying oh the actual content itself doesn't hold up a scrutiny. That's the difference This is because people keep calling you bad faith, maybe you shouldn't be calling other hypocrites by adopting hypocrisy Oh, no, no, no, here's the thing. I will I will just spitefully be a hypocrite towards hypocrites until you fucking stop Simple as that Okay, cool. Let's go back. Nope end of conversation back to the switch 2. Yes exit Good boy You know what? Okay, so anyway Taiwan Taiwan's economic daily has reported a new rumor regarding the hardware specs for the nintendo switch 2 The sources mentioned that the console makers ready to launch the new switch this year in 2024 as per market expectations However due to constraints such as global inflation The new product will retail for a hundred dollars more than the switch will be four hundred dollars to get it rather than three hundred dollars Which was the switch was three hundred dollars in 2017. There's been some inflation. Okay, that's just kind of how it is. Yeah Sfo entering his trolls remorse phase. No What the fuck? I don't regret any any of the trolling that I did before trolling is fun Uh, ethan largest ten dollars tbsw. You can't be the same way on certain things I've seen you not respond to points that seem valid when you'll respond to others Feels like you all both have his habits and degree, uh, no and here's why Um, there's just a practical reality of how many comments I can respond to right? There will always be good arguments that slip through the cracks because it's a random chatter or a random commoner And I can't read them all and I can't respond to them all right It's just that's just how it is. But like when i'm sitting across the table with v and we have real disagreements. All right He might send me certain certain points and i'll be like let's examine these. Okay, and okay Here's why I think this one's right. Here's why I think this one's wrong when I send v my points He tends to say I don't believe this because of the source that it comes from not because of what's actually said in the argument That's the difference. Okay And again, none of this is a slight against v. All right We're still friends. We're still we're still good Uh five dollars even dozen walls. Thanks for explaining comes with echo chamber. Could you explain it again more slowly? I'm, not sure my poor wall brain can take it really Yeah Basically an echo chamber is not only a place in which you encounter one idea It's when you attack the it's it's when you attack the legitimacy of other ideas rather than actually dealing with them Okay, so Here's the specs of the switch 2 the nvidia t2 t 239 processor. What is that? Oh It's always gonna say oh, yeah, it's it writes a tegra. Yeah, because tegras are like they're they're uh, they're tablet chips Okay, it makes sense um Eight gigabytes of memory. That's that's not very much like Computers have 32 64 128 gigabytes memory now. Like why does that only have eight? 64 gigabytes of internal storage This seems like even for like a switch like this is what you'd expect a tablet from 10 years ago to have even for us Like hold on Well, maybe they fucked themselves over already that is not true apples ghost You are saying inaccurate things about me and kind of proving my point what i'm saying. Okay, hold on switch Switch ram Okay, the switch has four gigabytes of ddr4 ram This one has eight switch internal storage So 32 gigs that's not 64. So it is an improvement but like I would have expected maybe 16 gigs of memory maybe a terabyte of storage like Considering how big games you're getting nowadays. Yeah, it seems like not. Yeah. Yeah My pc has 128 gigs of ram Yeah, like all my pcs have 64 gigabytes of ram and 64 is more than enough for almost everything you have to do nowadays, right? um My the one that I buy next will have 128. Yeah Um like it just These are phone specs. Yeah, like I was calling you condescending Well do it again in a super chat Yeah, this is not enough I think I think the chat's agreeing like this is not enough dude. Well, I guess nintendo is just following its pattern Maybe one good console one bad. Maybe yeah, I mean like like I have a fairphone four Fairphone four specs Display yeah, yeah. Yeah Memory 128 gigabytes six gigabytes of ram Um No, no, this is um, six gigabytes of ram and internal storage of 128. So like my phone has more More internal storage and roughly the same amount of ram. Yeah, like Well nintendo's dumb This is this like I understand making an underpowered system. Yeah To put it out at a lower price. Yeah and work in other interesting things instead. Yep. I understand that. Yes Even for that even for that this is too low Like I think this needs to be 16 or 32 megs and this has got to be like 10 times the storage. Yeah, like it's this ain't working man. This ain't working. Nope Do you believe is what he does because he and his family lived under Costco or I can't I can't pronounce his guy's name. I know who he is though And knows how bad socialism can get that's all true cjr like I agree with you, right? But this is why like this is why i've been telling him he hasn't accepted this logic But i've been telling him this whole time the difference is between our societies, right? He lives in a low trust society and you know, the the liberal capitalist democratic west Is not a low trust society That's the issue, right? Which is why they're different he keeps falling back and making the joke about it's like a race thing or like an ethnicity thing It's not It's it's it's a cultural thing for sure Ernest fowl five dollars common in ten cuck at hell. Thanks, man You fucker, uh Jiggy calzone five dollars dev in your echo chamber comment One thing that concerns me is seeing right wing forms slide into the same tree to spiral destroy the left of course Yeah, it's gonna happen. It's it's not possible for it to stop it at this point The right wing is gonna go insane. Of course they will The right wing will cobble itself into a fucking rampaging monster that'll just consume itself from the inside out just like the left did Read brian's comment. No, not brian's. Where did it go? I lost it Shit there it is. Nope, which one x that one Zero consumer the psi only has 16 gigs of ram ps4 had eight gigs of ram. Yeah. Okay. Well, then maybe it just needs 16 Okay Okay, let's move on because this is coming out actually they've been saying there's gonna be a nintendo switch probably in january february What are you doing scratching everything you're not supposed to crack don't complain about me cracking my knuckles You're scratching your whole fucking body. Get out of here I forgot to moisturize last night.

And then one kid in class Like he started going wild And I think like people were teasing him and it was kind of funny but like he's he like lost it, right? So he picks up A desk. Oh, no, I think I think I've I think I might have told the story. I have a faint memory of this He picked up the desk and he wanted to like throw it um, and the teacher was like trying to stop him and like It was me and like five other guys all just got up and it's like she clearly can't fucking handle this So we like we all like grabbed him, right? And like we were we were worried for a bit. The school was gonna be like students are fighting you're all but like nothing happened right, but I was like she couldn't fucking do anything dude. So like There's like five of us and we all just like grabbed this dude and we like we prevented him from throwing the desk And I was like listen, you gotta fucking calm down man. And what do you think like he didn't even get carried out by like Police or like like other teachers and nothing basically we calmed him down And then he stopped and he just went back to where he was sitting and we just kept going with class like crazy Nothing fucking happened man You and dave have these like crazy school stories I always hear crazy school stories from other people you want to know the most like Insane exciting thing that happened to me. There's two your music orgies No in in school jesus You guys spread to the music club where they all fucked each other one Yeah was an elementary school where a girl had like the like a giant bundle of like, uh, like pencils And stabbed another guy in the chest with them fucking hell. There's no blood or anything because it was like such a big like Mound of stuff That like nothing actually happened like he was hurt a bit But like there was no like it was not as bad as it would have been with just a single pencil Yep The other one was also an elementary school where me and a whole bunch of the guys got on a rock fight And I was the only one who actually had good aim. So I hit a guy in the eye. Oh, dude No, he was fine. The worst part was that he was my neighbor. Naomi had the tutor up approve her. Yep Yep, because this one time in band camp Apparently she's actually really mad that people keep quoting at her whenever they see her Like she's well, well like she was she was like like 19 or something When you came in that movie and now she's like walking around with her kids Yeah, and people interrupt her and like say it. Yeah, and she's just like the whole thing Yes, the whole the whole thing and they're like, she's like, please stop. I have my kids with me like you need to stop You're only supposed to say the save for work version in front of the children. Jesus Okay Oh, let's see. I'll just scroll back up a little bit Okay Five dollars from our most foul dev that is your subjective opinion of the things I bring you your conclusions are wrong on many outcomes Looking predicted hillary would win Did you predict that? I don't remember I might have way back in the day I mean, yes, i've been wrong before. Yeah, of course. Not everyone is 100 but the issue ultimately is that like okay, you and I have had this conversation but like If you say something with no proof And then in the future proof comes out That actually does prove what you were saying initially, but you had no proof before that doesn't actually make you retroactively, right? It means before you were guessing And yet you guessed correctly, but you didn't have a reason to think that though. That's and like that's that's just rationality You know like you you can you can guess things and have that guess end up being correct That doesn't mean that you had a good reason to guess it before Because you're always going to forget due to due to selective bias all the times when you guessed and you were wrong, right? Okay That's why I always say hey Wait for court wait for documents to come out wait like wait for the ruling wait for if there's if there's indictments coming Wait, wait, you read the indictments like always say wait for these things, man Uh five dollars from holtzner more proof that men are stronger also the brain injury is probably from her being a woman. Oh my god Uh five dollars, uh butters, thank you working retail in california is definitely the words of trust in the high trust society Nine percent people do wait in line and buy the product. Yeah.

What do you mean? That's the whole point of the vibe is I have been um blonde two dollars artemis and the methods rationality dev is fat Thanks, um Uh, you know that it could be five dollars. Thank you All right dev say I want to debate a point of yours or another what terms and criteria to show you this person is being honest and legitimate what's the thing like I'm, i'm not saying that v or even as fans are being dishonest the issue is that they don't have like proper thinking methods They don't have good thought no, no, no, no, it's not the thoughts that are bad. It's the It's the methods by which they come to their conclusions Like Can't think right ergo bad. No like like rationality is definitely an art form Like you have to understand like what makes a thought like grounded in reason and what doesn't right like good thoughts good bad thoughts No, not good. I'm not talking about good or bad. I'm talking about reasonable versus unreasonable You fuck I know Okay Ten dollars arnold's foul. All right I'll pause it an idea for ten dollars. Thank you conservative bedrock world views are more capable of predicting outcomes in current events than liberal world Views dev is bad at predicting outcomes of current events. Okay, so artemis if that's what you say when I say for example It looks like based on the evidence provided There is a decent chance that trump is going to be convicted in the documents case specifically Is that in your opinion a good or bad prediction Assuming that you've read the documents indictment What do you think Um, i'm giving him the chance Uh, well, listen ten dollars. Thank you, man Crazy school story bully in school broke off the blade of a paper cutter attacking their kid with it Both kids got punished because zero tolerance bs.

What a last name 25 very 2020 of shad therian. See I was right bad prediction I can predict the future. Oh okay, so you think So so artemis, what do you think? Will come out of the documents case for trump What what what is your prediction regarding specifically the trump documents case? Give me give it to me. Let's get it on On fucking camera on recording right now So so we both have our predictions down. We'll see where it goes. Okay? Because I think I think there's like a decent chance. He will get fucked with this indictment Okay Okay Silence was definitely, you know, she uh, pleaded not guilty and I could present mental disease or defect But the jury found she wasn't mentally ill Yeah, she huh? She smoked meth. Oh, dude, i'm gonna fucking behead you it turns out being on meth in the basement of therian's mother green But it's okay Strangled decapitated dismembered left the party branch throughout the house in a vehicle wild dude wild No, they are that's why I support a cab, what do you mean What do you mean by that hold center? No, no, they are that's why I support a cab. I don't know what you're saying. I don't know Anyway, yeah Yep, she discovered her son's head in a bucket in the basement. Oh my god. Imagine fucking discovering your son's head in a bucket Oh jesus No fight someone in court hold on she attacked her attorney why Why She was sentenced. Okay. She was sentenced And she attacked her attorney. Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I don't want to spend my life in jail I want to attack you because you said you I wouldn't That's yeah, that's fucking insane dude Blonde five dollars. I said you weren't reading him. So I came to youtube. I was answering answering my question Also, why don't you pretend that you like me? Listen I appreciate the donations but blonde because you are a gaming stream viewer I do like you of course Remember the time that name we defended this woman like two minutes ago. Yeah, I do I did not defend her. I was defending life from doves bad takes Okay, no No, we're still on this article. Yeah, jesus This guy this 15 year old got high in unknown drug punched the 60 year old teacher gave her a severe medical injury. She was uh, Taken to the university of cincinnati medical center where she had her skull cap removed to prevent damage from swelling. Yep The police then found the alleged attacker in the school's career center lobby who was apparently hallucinating had a self-inflicted head wound. Oh my god He's he's fucking losing it dude He was taken to the hospital and then to hamilton county juvenile detention center on a charge of felonious assault And the school was investigating the incident honestly to be honest But 15 year old is on drugs that hard they probably should be in juvie. So that's yeah There's no current threat to the school community it seems to be like an isolated thing. Yeah, but still like The fuck are you doing kid making bad life decisions the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus you already read that. Yeah, i'm just looking up not allowed Okay teen arrested in federal terrorism probe What? Okay This guy I don't know if this is in the article. I did look it up This guy is the son of a prominent attorney. Okay, um leaders from the city and federal law enforcement on monday Announced that a 17 year old residence And that's the 17 year old resident of western delhi has been arrested and charged a part of federal federal terrorism investigation The juvenile was taken into custody by fbi swat officers at his residence in the winefield section of philadelphia Um investigation led by fbi joint terrorism task force which includes detective details from president from philadelphia police department is active and ongoing, okay I think me too dev even though I watch more dave solo streams because I like watching entertaining people. Fuck you goes in your band Uh Rsm 10 It will evaporate into the ether If trump doesn't win outright due to how poorly the prosecution has been ran He will appeal until he wins in november and then the case will be dropped after okay, so rms actually here I'll agree with you on this partially, right if trump wins the election In november, I think these cases will go nowhere. I agree with you on that If trump loses the election in november I do think he will probably um, he will probably be prosecuted He'll probably be He's not going to win the documents case, I think all right the other cases like you mentioned artemis file the georgia rico case is now in question because they discovered some weird shit happening with one of the uh With one of people they brought onto it. So that's true. That seems to be true as far as I can tell So maybe the georgia rico case falls apart possibly right the documents case. It seems to be dead to rights But if trump wins in november, it might not matter at all, right? So i'm saying if trump loses The election in 2024. He probably also loses in the documents case. That's my prediction. Okay? Let's get it on record Okay, so the district attorney's office has charged the juvenile with weapons of mass destruction criminal conspiracy arson causing arson catastrophe attempt to To commit criminal mischief possession of instrument of a crime and recklessly endangering another person Okay, listen, I know mischief is like an actual legal term but attempt to commit criminal mischief is just really really funny. Yep. I know The work of the fbi joint terrorism task force potentially thwarted a catastrophic terrorist attack in the name of preferred Ideology that in no way shape or form represents the beliefs of the overall majority of peace seeking people of faith including muslims You're reading this too fast. This was a 17 year old. It's not going to be completely said in this article This is a 17 year old son of a muslim immigrant who is a lawyer Who got radicalized probably online and he joined some fucking terrorist group. Jesus How about just don't be radicalized guys Just don't do it Yeah Damn, wow Honestly that poor dad. Yeah, like to like move. Well, maybe well, maybe he's also like a fucking extremist Well, like maybe but like listen, let's just go on the assumption that he's not right Can you imagine like immigrating to a better like a better country like at least that you think is a better country and like Actually being able to like achieve your dreams of having a good job in said country Right and then having your kid just like ruin your image and reputation forever that's just that's just Unfortunate like that is just you would probably feel like an utter failure of a parent at that point in time Yeah, that just sucks Apples ghost says obama struggled to win at 34 percent ruling about 39. Yeah, here's the thing polling is often right But every once in a while it's wrong like polling was wrong with trump 2016, right? The polls had hillary to win hillary did not win Um, but generally polls are pretty correct. I think biden's kind of screwed. Yeah Armors file five dollars Um free to the poisonous tree all current indictments have been tainted by the same bad actor working together as one gets thrown out The rest well, I don't know about that I'm, not sure you're using through the poisonous tree correctly because they are coming from different different offices different people like different states I don't know if if what you're saying is completely true there artemis But thank you for all the donations do okay, so The juvenile is alleged to have been in contact with individuals and groups designated by the u.s. State department as global terrorists including katabat al tawhid while jihad Who is believed to primarily operate in syria's responsible for attacks including the deadly 2017 attack on st Petersburg russia metro and the 2016 suicide car bombing of the chinese embassy in bishkek kurzakstan What is this kid doing fucking getting linked up with these guys Making bad life decisions self-radicalization by young people via the internet is a threat to all families Yep, so guys you should instead join the cult of dev where you send me all your money You get radicalized, but you yeah Yeah Uh real holes in their five dollars look at how the media takes care to say this doesn't represent all of them Imagine if he was a conservative would they take the same care? Of course, they wouldn't if it's like a right-winger They wouldn't say they're obviously not all right wingers. Like it is like their their bias is kind of disgusting Even though they should be saying it. They should be saying yeah. Yeah What's next? Pennsylvania toddler allegedly killed by dad's girlfriend who fed her acetone batteries and a screw Oh, this is the one you were looking at earlier and I just kind of cried Guys, listen, she looks like a fucking baby, too. This is just she's 20. Yeah, I know but like This is just fucked up. Why are there so many fucked up articles today? This is sad A pennsylvania woman is accused of fatally poisoning her boyfriend's 18 month old daughter by feeding her batteries screws and nail polish remover After she researched the harmful effects the items could have on a child before the killing Well, I'll just do it in incognito mode dude, it'll be fine This is why you go to the library and search up stuff Oh Alicia owens 20 was arrested thursday for the suspected homicide of iris rita alfera After an autopsy determined the child died due to fatal levels of acetone in her blood Owens had been living with iris's father bailey jacoby when he left the house to go to the store on june 5th, 2023 Jacoby who had visitation rights with iris then received a call from owen saying something was wrong with his daughter He rushed to the newcastle home to find his baby girl unresponsive and quickly called 9-1-1 Can you imagine just going to the store to get stuff and coming home and your kids like dead Holy shit, that's really fucking sad. Yep She was rushed to umpc jamison hospital in newcastle, pennsylvania for treatment But she was later airlifted one roughly one hour away to upmc children's hospital in pittsburgh She died four days later due to organ failure Iris lived with her mother emily alfera and her grandparents while her father jacoby had visitation rights owen said that police that Owen told owens told the police the girl had hit her head after she cramped up and fell off her bed Autopsy showed that iris had ingested numerous water beads along with a button-shaped batteries and a metal screw Months before she died. Oh my god months before she died A search of uh, are you okay now? A search of owen's phone revealed she had been looking up information on household products that could cause a child serious harm or death Including water beads batteries and nail polish jesus fucking christ, dude Jesus fucking christ, dude Like the fact that it's months ago shows this was just premeditated too like She's she's fucked Like she's going to to giga jail She also searched beauty products that are poisonous to kids and medications leading to cause accidental poisoning deaths in children Holy shit, dude Yep, the findings on her phone were a crucial piece of evidence against her Okay, listen, I know I say I don't like kids all the time and listen like I don't But like it is always really sad when a kid like that young Dies like like situation like in situations like this because like they didn't even get the chance to live this is the mother and the child and then the father had visitation and then This was this was the new girlfriend of the father. Holy shit It honestly if she ever got out of jail and I was that dad I would straight up murder 100 So there was uh, there was no evidence linking the father to the death at all There's nothing throughout the investigation to show that he had any knowledge or involvement what happened to the baby He was questioned multiple times was cooperative I actually think you know what? I actually think that's true I think in this case, it was just like some really fucked up Young woman who was just like I want to spend time with this baby dad with this with this baby's daddy Yeah, but I don't want him to actually be a daddy so i'm just gonna make him be mine fucking hell man Fuck that's what's next.

Well, they're the they're the taxes guys, right? Yeah, I know. Yeah. Well if you don't pay your taxes, they come and raid you With special agents specifically for the irs. I didn't know that I thought they just used like cops Before you have some police involvement. Yeah, but like they have their own enforcement arm too. Really? Yeah. Holy shit pretty much every every like Even in canada, it's the same way like every branch of government has its own like enforcement arm So like that's why like park rangers. No, okay. They they have the same some of the same enforcement powers as police do Yes, the park rangers are different A statement released thursday fbi officials confirmed that they are investigating the death of an irs special agent. They're not share further details significant tragedy for the agents involved the agency their families Just really sad to see the federal bureau of prison says investigating a shooting incident at the federal correctional institute institutional phoenix firing range So I know people were people on twitter were saying like oh my god, dude They obviously killed one of their own because they're covering something up It could also just be like an accident. This is one. This is probably gonna be just hey, uh, Make sure you guys follow all the safety rules of the shooting range and then people didn't follow the safety rules of the shooting range So that's the way it always is like this agent was the one who was going after like the big corpos Because government and they're shaking hands. So like I mean The irs identified the fallen agent space seven year old special agent patrick bauer. What did he do? You know, what's funny is that I would have believed that a few like like several years ago But after being in retail so long and realizing just how fucking stupid people are It's definitely just incompetence of a person that caused this. Yep Nothing about him anyway, yeah, you watch you go back and just like he was actually investigating big corporations. They took him out If it turns out that he was he was investigating george soros The u.s postal service has its own law enforcement branch too.

So the australians found it. You okay? This is why I don't fucking read the news Yeah, the australians discovered it on the internet and then got the americans at volks that happen in america, okay, it'll be okay Each of the four videos shared with authorities reportedly showed a different assault and they take place in different rooms and locations including bathrooms at the mall Fernandez is the only suspect charged in the case so far It's unclear if the other is said to appear in the video has been identified by officials Police closed in on him using an open source image repository to search for the face of one of the children And then it matched it with social media images shared by one of the women When police showed the child's mom a sanitized image from the abuse materials the woman reportedly noticed a pair of bracelets owned by fernandez Police then saw those bracelets on the suspect's social media.
