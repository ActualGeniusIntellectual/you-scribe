00:00.000 --> 00:10.300
Back when I was spending my days coughing up coronavirus-infused phlegm, a pretty notable

00:10.300 --> 00:11.740
event hit the news cycle.

00:11.740 --> 00:15.300
It came and went, and now nobody even thinks about it anymore, beyond the occasional meme.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.060
I'm talking about the attack on former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul

00:20.060 --> 00:21.060
Pelosi.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.780
One of the good things about being bedridden is that I can actually examine this event

00:23.780 --> 00:27.700
with some distance and objectivity, unlike every other monkey who just spits out whatever

00:27.700 --> 00:29.820
was the most politically convenient take for them.

00:29.820 --> 00:33.560
Alternatively, I could also just be writing an older script that I was too sick to finish

00:33.560 --> 00:35.240
in order to recoup some lost work hours.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
Who's to say?

00:36.240 --> 00:37.840
Here's the official account of what happened.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.080
David DePape, a Canadian—don't go blaming us for this, guys—broke into Nancy Pelosi's

00:42.080 --> 00:45.480
house by smashing through glass-paneled doors in the back.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.480
Nancy wasn't home, but her husband, Paul Pelosi, was asleep in a third-floor bedroom.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.080
DePape's activities woke up Paul, and when confronted, DePape said that he wanted to

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
speak to Nancy.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.960
Paul said she wasn't home, and DePape replied, I'll wait.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.340
Paul claimed that he had to go to the bathroom, and once alone, he called 911.

01:00.340 --> 01:03.540
With the line open, he began to loudly ask, why are you here, what are you going to do

01:03.540 --> 01:06.120
to me, which prompted the dispatcher to send the cops.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.180
Once the police arrived, they knocked on the door.

01:08.180 --> 01:11.980
Paul opened it and began to struggle with DePape in the doorway over a hammer in DePape's

01:11.980 --> 01:12.980
hands.

01:12.980 --> 01:16.460
The cops told both men to drop the weapon, but DePape won the struggle and cracked Paul

01:16.460 --> 01:17.460
over the head with it.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.620
Shortly after, DePape was tackled by the cops.

01:19.620 --> 01:24.140
It was discovered that he had on him zip ties, duct tape, rope, a second hammer, gloves,

01:24.140 --> 01:25.380
and a list of targets.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.960
Paul Pelosi was taken to the hospital for surgery to treat the skull fracture that the

01:28.960 --> 01:30.260
hammer blow had caused.

01:30.260 --> 01:33.760
He remained out of the public eye until a week ago, where he finally appeared at an

01:33.760 --> 01:35.200
official event with his wife.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.880
The extent of his injuries were enough that he had to wear a hat to conceal them.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.000
Statements given to the police by DePape reveal that the attack was politically motivated,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.920
though I'm not sure you needed to think too hard to figure that out.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.480
DePape sees Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the pack of liars that is the Democratic Party,

01:50.480 --> 01:52.260
and his actions were to fight tyranny.

01:52.260 --> 01:56.760
His plan was to kidnap and interrogate Pelosi, specifically that he would break her kneecaps

01:56.760 --> 02:00.360
if she didn't tell the truth, so that she would have to appear in public in a wheelchair.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.840
He also considered his mission to be a suicidal one.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.840
And nobody else is going to say it, so I will.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.440
This guy looks like Gigachad if he had Down Syndrome.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.020
Though the police hadn't known about DePape before the attack, which is a bit surprising

02:11.020 --> 02:14.380
considering how often the feds have somebody on their radar but still fail to stop them

02:14.380 --> 02:18.140
in time, we actually do know quite a bit about DePape's life before the event.

02:18.140 --> 02:22.920
He migrated to the US after high school and resurfaced with public nudist activist Gypsy

02:22.920 --> 02:24.300
Taub in Hawaii.

02:24.300 --> 02:28.400
At some point, they entered into a relationship, and when Taub moved to San Francisco, DePape

02:28.400 --> 02:29.400
followed.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.840
Taub became a prominent figure in public nudity activism, and by 2013, when Taub was at the

02:33.840 --> 02:37.640
height of her fame and recognition, DePape was often seen among her entourage.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.320
However, also by 2013, Taub and DePape had broken up.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.600
DePape seems to have continued hanging around her because she was a rising star in that

02:45.600 --> 02:48.260
community, and he still gained some influence through her.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.280
But also probably because he still had feelings for her.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.280
He was the groomsman in her wedding to someone else, and for a while, he lived in the same

02:54.280 --> 02:58.900
house as Taub, her husband, and her three children, selling hemp bracelets to make money.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.980
Taub and DePape would continue an on-off relationship until 2015, when Taub finally broke it off

03:03.980 --> 03:04.980
for good.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.700
At that point, DePape became homeless.

03:06.700 --> 03:10.180
He had already been struggling with various mental health problems ever since leaving

03:10.180 --> 03:13.200
high school, but while homeless, things really began to get worse for him.

03:13.200 --> 03:18.020
He exhibited paranoia, megalomania, and drug abuse while with Taub, but it all went overdrive

03:18.020 --> 03:20.800
after he joined San Francisco's homeless population.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.860
By the time of the attack on Paul Pelosi, he had managed to make his way to Richmond,

03:24.860 --> 03:27.720
renting out a garage to live in and working as a handyman.

03:27.720 --> 03:32.060
The entire activist group that DePape had associated with in the 2000s and early 2010s

03:32.060 --> 03:36.720
had fully collapsed by 2017, and its members have all suffered similar fates as DePape.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.540
Mental health problems, drugs, poverty, and run-ins with the law.

03:39.540 --> 03:44.480
Gypsy Taub herself was arrested in 2019 and tossed in jail in 2021 for attempted child

03:44.480 --> 03:48.320
abduction, stalking, and child abuse of a 14-year-old boy who had been friends with

03:48.320 --> 03:49.320
one of her sons.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.280
Taub had been trying to convince the boy to run away from his family and join hers.

03:53.280 --> 03:58.040
Gypsy Taub, who is now in her 50s, seems to have always enjoyed the company of young men.

03:58.040 --> 04:02.140
DePape was 20 when they were first spotted together in real life, and her former husband

04:02.140 --> 04:06.220
was also 20 at the time of their marriage, though there is shaky evidence that she had

04:06.220 --> 04:08.680
contact with both of them when they were still underage.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.140
In DePape's case, through the internet as he was still in Canada at the time, DePape's

04:12.140 --> 04:15.620
family said that after high school, DePape followed a woman to the United States and

04:15.620 --> 04:16.620
vanished.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.180
This is just my opinion because the evidence is incomplete, but Gypsy Taub sounds like

04:20.180 --> 04:25.020
a pedophile and a pervert who like the idea of having sexual access to a stable of underage

04:25.020 --> 04:30.300
boys and barely legal men, and her, her partners, and her activists are all now leading ruined

04:30.300 --> 04:33.380
lives of substance abuse, sexual degeneracy, and incarceration.

04:33.380 --> 04:37.060
That's not to say that I think DePape's innocent of what he did to Paul Pelosi, like

04:37.060 --> 04:38.480
it's all Taub's fault or something.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.060
No, no, he's still responsible.

04:40.060 --> 04:44.840
But considering how conspiracy-brained their group was, with 9-11 truther shit and God

04:44.840 --> 04:48.360
knows what else, I am not surprised this is where DePape ended up.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.000
DePape's social media use gives us insight into the conspiracy claims.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.040
Initially, his blog posts were all about lefty-style hippy-dippy spirituality, use of psychedelics,

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
that sort of stuff.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.440
This led him down a far-left rabbit hole where he began to get into the anti-government 9-11

05:02.440 --> 05:05.520
truther stuff that is common at the fringes of politics on all sides.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.580
He emerged on the far right, stating in a blog post made a month before the attack that

05:09.580 --> 05:11.740
Gamergate had radicalized him.

05:11.740 --> 05:15.660
You know, I'm never going to not laugh at Gamergate getting brought up in the year of

05:15.660 --> 05:17.500
our lord 2022.

05:17.500 --> 05:22.100
All gamers did was tell feminist journos to stop being corrupt fucks a decade ago, and

05:22.100 --> 05:24.940
since then it's become a global boogeyman for the leftoids.

05:24.940 --> 05:29.300
Guys, guys, if Nancy Pelosi would just stop sucking off journalists for positive coverage,

05:29.300 --> 05:30.700
this could have all been avoided.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.020
It's incredible how delusional these people are.

05:33.020 --> 05:35.100
Okay, let's actually consider the claim though.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.540
Is it possible that Gamergate radicalized a Pape, as so many of these bottom-of-the-barrel

05:39.540 --> 05:40.980
game journos like to claim?

05:40.980 --> 05:42.700
The answer is probably not.

05:42.700 --> 05:47.240
Though Gamergate did have its more radical elements, who went on to do more radical political

05:47.240 --> 05:51.520
activism, most notably Milo, most people who talked about Gamergate stuff didn't actually

05:51.520 --> 05:53.240
care about political radicalism.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.580
They weren't there to subvert the movement and take it over.

05:55.580 --> 05:59.540
They were actually legitimately talking about either the ethical concerns or the feminist

05:59.540 --> 06:01.080
push into the gaming space.

06:01.080 --> 06:04.780
That second one is certainly political, but I don't think that seeing some corrupt video

06:04.780 --> 06:08.840
game feminists acting shitty is what caused a Pape to pick up a hammer and whack Paul

06:08.840 --> 06:11.160
Pelosi over the head a decade later.

06:11.160 --> 06:15.840
If I had to guess, literally every other influence throughout his fucked-up life had more to

06:15.840 --> 06:17.380
do with it than Gamergate.

06:17.380 --> 06:21.040
There's a populist pipeline that moves people around the fridges of politics without them

06:21.040 --> 06:24.060
ever actually crossing through the liberal conservative center.

06:24.060 --> 06:29.260
If your baseline point of view is, I don't trust any of society's institutions by default,

06:29.260 --> 06:33.240
everyone and everything is always corrupt and there's no fixing it within the system,

06:33.240 --> 06:37.580
it's very easy for socialists to become fascists, to become libertarians and vice-versa simply

06:37.580 --> 06:39.760
by switching the targets of their ire.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.800
Their reasoning remains the same, they've simply changed what team they play for.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.820
That's not to say that there's never a time to distrust an institution, there certainly

06:46.820 --> 06:50.860
is, and we need the corrective mechanism of the fringes for the center to function.

06:50.860 --> 06:54.300
But the problems begin to start when the fringes become mainline politics.

06:54.300 --> 06:58.480
It's for this reason that I think to Pape's very unorthodox life led him down a conspiracy

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
rabbit hole.

06:59.480 --> 07:04.020
When the popular conspiracies were predominantly left-wing hippie drug bullshit, he was a leftist,

07:04.020 --> 07:08.300
and when those conspiracies shifted towards right-wing QAnon bullshit, he became a rightist.

07:08.300 --> 07:11.640
Had he stayed out of trouble long enough to see another political realignment, he likely

07:11.640 --> 07:13.420
would have gone down that path along with it.

07:13.420 --> 07:18.260
So when the leftoids say that Pape was radicalized by Gamergate, that's clearly just cope.

07:18.260 --> 07:21.900
But it's not like the rightoids weren't huffing their own copium on this case as well.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.340
Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter,

07:23.340 --> 07:27.820
The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and derange conspiracy

07:27.820 --> 07:28.820
theories.

07:28.820 --> 07:31.660
It's shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result.

07:31.660 --> 07:35.240
As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.000
Elon Musk replied with this now-deleted tweet,

07:38.000 --> 07:42.060
There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye, with

07:42.060 --> 07:45.060
a link to an article on the Santa Monica Observer.

07:45.060 --> 07:48.900
You can tell that this is a tabloid rag just by the length of the headline.

07:48.900 --> 07:49.900
The awful truth.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.500
Paul Pelosi was struck on the head with a hammer by a lunatic early Friday morning.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.200
Paul Pelosi stated that he doesn't know who the male is, but he advised that his name

07:57.200 --> 07:58.880
is David and that he's a friend.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.880
Yeah, right.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
Jesus.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.040
Alright, let's take a look.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.160
Authorities have changed their story of the Friday morning break-in at the Pelosi's

08:05.160 --> 08:09.700
home several times, making it more difficult to understand the strange and heinous crime.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.620
Authorities now call the idea that the two men knew each other ridiculous.

08:12.620 --> 08:17.320
But none of the various versions explain how suspect and victim ended up holding the same

08:17.320 --> 08:20.960
hammer in front of the police, or why they didn't shoot and kill the suspect before

08:20.960 --> 08:22.280
he struck Paul Pelosi.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.280
As Megyn Kelly said,

08:23.280 --> 08:26.520
I smell a rat here, meaning the various stories don't add up.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.320
Why was DePape in his underwear?

08:28.320 --> 08:30.580
Why were none of these security cameras working?

08:30.580 --> 08:34.280
What happened to the third-party witness who was there in the first version of events?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.240
Who opened the door to let in the police?

08:36.240 --> 08:41.640
Why did DePape, a psychopathic criminal, grant Pelosi a bathroom break, during which he called

08:41.640 --> 08:44.760
911 and described DePape as a friend?

08:44.760 --> 08:48.680
Why didn't Pelosi lock himself in the bathroom until the San Francisco Police Department

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
arrived?

08:49.680 --> 08:51.460
Was there a third person at the seven-bedroom residence?

08:51.460 --> 08:52.840
And what happened to that person?

08:52.840 --> 08:56.440
On the right, there's a belief that DePape was actually the secret gay lover of Paul

08:56.440 --> 08:57.440
Pelosi.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.680
Their fight was a lover's spat, and that the whole thing is just a massive cover-up

09:00.680 --> 09:04.920
of that scandal, due to the 2022 midterms being just around the corner at the time.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.880
The issue is, none of that seems to be true.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.680
There's memes about how the window DePape broke to enter the house had glass on the

09:10.680 --> 09:12.880
outside so clearly it wasn't from someone breaking in.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.480
But that's just not true.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.360
If you've ever broken a window, you should know that not all of the glass goes in with

09:18.360 --> 09:19.480
the force of the break.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.960
In fact, some will be expelled back out due to that same force.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.820
It's kind of like ripples in the surface of the water, where the first wave after you

09:25.820 --> 09:30.020
toss something into the water rises above the surface due to displacement.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.020
And you know what?

09:31.020 --> 09:32.020
Rhytoids should know this.

09:32.020 --> 09:36.240
I know you guys have autistically examined riot footage of antifa goons smashing shit

09:36.240 --> 09:39.540
up, and there's always glass on the outside of the windows that they break.

09:39.540 --> 09:43.900
But the glass contention is the only part of this alternative story that is based on

09:43.900 --> 09:45.060
physical evidence.

09:45.060 --> 09:50.080
The rest of it comes from that shitty Santa Monica article, which is of dubious trustworthiness.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.780
I know that Dinesh D'Souza, Steve Bannon, Elon Musk, and a bunch of other people have

09:53.780 --> 09:58.040
repeated the claim, but they all got their claims from this one source.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.180
And here is what that source reads.

10:00.180 --> 10:03.920
Okay, so here's the theory, as related to me by a source.

10:03.920 --> 10:09.140
Castro nudists are a group of really radical gay male prostitutes that parade around naked

10:09.140 --> 10:10.460
with cock rings.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.820
First of all, the police did not come in response to an alarm.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.580
They came in response to a wellness check.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.220
So someone had to call them to check on Pelosi.

10:17.220 --> 10:21.140
When Pelosi didn't answer the phone, the cops broke the sliding glass door to get in.

10:21.140 --> 10:25.100
Pelosi was struggling with a suspect who was in his underwear, related to this guy by a

10:25.100 --> 10:26.100
source.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.100
Come on, guys.

10:27.100 --> 10:31.200
If you shit on mainstream journals for saying that an anonymous source told me the story

10:31.200 --> 10:35.620
and I can't tell you who it is, but it's totally true, how could you possibly trust this buffoon?

10:35.620 --> 10:37.400
Well, to me, the answer is obvious.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.840
The right can be just as ideologically motivated as the left to believe stories that help them

10:41.840 --> 10:44.820
and discard stories that hurt them regardless of the truth.

10:44.820 --> 10:48.480
And of course, being signal boosted by big name rightoids on Twitter also helps.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.280
But there's just no evidence here.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.560
There's no evidence that anyone was in their underwear.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.960
The paper was dressed and Pelosi was in his pajamas.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.080
There's no evidence that it was a secret gay meetup.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.440
There's no evidence that there was a third person in the house.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.280
No evidence that the paper was working as a Castro nudist prostitute.

11:03.280 --> 11:07.660
That just seems to be a weird game of telephone style misinterpretation of his past as a leftist

11:07.660 --> 11:08.800
nudist activist.

11:08.800 --> 11:13.680
The claim that Pelosi said to Pape was a friend on the 911 call is also false, as both the

11:13.680 --> 11:18.560
FBI's investigation into the call confirmed that Pelosi didn't know who to Pape was.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.200
And Pelosi also later stated to the police in the ambulance that he had never seen to

11:22.200 --> 11:23.200
Pape before.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.160
Some of this stuff is actually excusable.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.880
During the initial hours of a breaking story, there's often jumbled contradictory information,

11:28.880 --> 11:32.560
and we can generally expect the truth to shake out as more info is revealed.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.160
Many news outlets reported on some of this stuff, only to issue backtracks and apologies

11:36.160 --> 11:37.820
as new information became available.

11:37.820 --> 11:42.420
For example, this report from MSNBC repeated a Department of Justice claim that the police,

11:42.420 --> 11:44.360
not Pelosi, opened the front door.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.660
After a knock and announce, the front door was opened by Mr. Pelosi.

11:48.660 --> 11:54.520
The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency or tried to leave his home, but

11:54.520 --> 12:00.040
instead began walking several feet back into the foyer, toward the assailant, and away

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
from police.

12:01.040 --> 12:07.000
It's unclear if the 82-year-old was already injured or what his mental state was, say

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
sources.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.740
According to court documents, when the officer asked what was going on, defendants smiled

12:13.740 --> 12:15.860
and said, everything's good.

12:15.860 --> 12:22.100
But instantaneously, a struggle ensued as police clearly saw David DePape strike Paul

12:22.100 --> 12:25.300
Pelosi in the head with a hammer.

12:25.300 --> 12:30.960
After tackling the suspect, officers rushed to Mr. Pelosi, who was lying in a pool of

12:30.960 --> 12:31.960
blood.

12:31.960 --> 12:37.760
What we do know is he brutally attacked Mr. Pelosi and attempted to kill him.

12:37.760 --> 12:44.560
Why Pelosi didn't try to flee or tell responding officers he was in distress is unclear.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.780
Fear takes over.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.080
Fear freezes people.

12:47.080 --> 12:51.300
It came out later that the DOJ was incorrect, and police body cam footage showed that Pelosi

12:51.300 --> 12:52.840
opened the front door instead.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.340
The online right took this to mean that now that the midterms are over, the real story

12:56.340 --> 12:59.340
about Pelosi's hidden gay relationship was finally going to come out.

12:59.340 --> 13:02.420
But while that made for a funny meme, it never actually happened.

13:02.420 --> 13:05.760
The body cam footage hasn't yet been made public, likely due to legal reasons related

13:05.760 --> 13:07.220
to evidence in the upcoming trial.

13:07.220 --> 13:11.340
But everyone who's watched it says that Pelosi answered the door, he was acting erratically,

13:11.340 --> 13:14.580
likely out of fear, and then got smashed in the head by DePape's hammer.

13:14.580 --> 13:18.380
Now, it is possible that they're all just lying, that all of these sources are keeping

13:18.380 --> 13:20.500
what was really on the body cam footage secret.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.320
The politicians, the cops, the FBI, all the news outlets, the journos, everyone, they're

13:24.320 --> 13:25.920
all colluding to cover it all up.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.320
And until we see the body cam footage for ourselves, we can't truly know.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.320
But frankly, I doubt it.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.640
It doesn't seem plausible to me.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.240
The leaps of logic are just too great.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.040
I feel like the body cam footage is going to be released at some point, once it's

13:36.040 --> 13:38.840
legally possible, or get leaked, so all we've got to do is wait it out.

13:38.840 --> 13:42.420
I might have my foot in my mouth in this one, but I don't think so, especially since most

13:42.420 --> 13:44.800
of the evidence lines up with my interpretation of events.

13:44.800 --> 13:49.080
DePape isn't Paul Pelosi's secret gay lover, he's just a conspiracy-brained populoid

13:49.080 --> 13:53.700
who has entirely fucked his life up with nearly 25 years of bad decisions, and an innocent

13:53.700 --> 13:55.700
old man has paid the price for it.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.460
People are also saying that Nancy Pelosi's decision to step down as Democratic House

13:59.460 --> 14:04.140
Leader is also a result of the attack, and therefore that, in some way, DePape got at

14:04.140 --> 14:05.660
least a little bit of what he wanted.

14:05.660 --> 14:06.980
But I don't buy this either.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.700
Nancy Pelosi looks like a walking fucking corpse, guys.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.820
Dude, look at that shadow, how do her eyes even stay in her head?

14:12.820 --> 14:15.140
It's time for her to start winding down, guys.

14:15.140 --> 14:18.180
No conspiracy needed on this one, she's got one foot in the grave, and the other one

14:18.180 --> 14:19.180
was made out of plastic.

14:19.180 --> 14:22.200
I've always found Nancy Pelosi to be kind of cringe personally, her policies can be

14:22.200 --> 14:26.200
hit and miss, but as a person she just seems slimy, and all of that dem worship from the

14:26.200 --> 14:27.480
left doesn't make it any better.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.960
But none of that makes any sort of violence against her husband acceptable, and trying

14:30.960 --> 14:36.000
to twist the story into some sort of gay prostitution scandal based on literally nothing because

14:36.000 --> 14:39.160
it serves your political interests is pretty scummy, guys.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.240
Paul Pelosi actually did nothing wrong.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.840
He's not responsible for anything his wife did, he's certainly the victim of what DePape

14:44.840 --> 14:45.840
did.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.860
And let's hope DePape is locked up for the rest of his life like the shitheel he is.

14:49.860 --> 14:50.860
Okay, listen.

14:50.860 --> 14:56.000
You're watching this on release at 8-30pm EST, tonight I'm doing finally, after like

14:56.000 --> 14:58.620
over a month of not doing it, the community movie nights.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.100
You're in the five dollar club?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.300
Get yourself into the masterpiece theater, we're watching a movie tonight.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.300
I'll see you there, guys.

15:03.300 --> 15:03.800
I love you.
