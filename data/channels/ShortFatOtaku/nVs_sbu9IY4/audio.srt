1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Back when I was spending my days coughing up coronavirus-infused phlegm, a pretty notable

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,740
event hit the news cycle.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,300
It came and went, and now nobody even thinks about it anymore, beyond the occasional meme.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,060
I'm talking about the attack on former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,060
Pelosi.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,780
One of the good things about being bedridden is that I can actually examine this event

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,700
with some distance and objectivity, unlike every other monkey who just spits out whatever

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,820
was the most politically convenient take for them.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,560
Alternatively, I could also just be writing an older script that I was too sick to finish

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,240
in order to recoup some lost work hours.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Who's to say?

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,840
Here's the official account of what happened.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,080
David DePape, a Canadian—don't go blaming us for this, guys—broke into Nancy Pelosi's

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,480
house by smashing through glass-paneled doors in the back.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Nancy wasn't home, but her husband, Paul Pelosi, was asleep in a third-floor bedroom.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,080
DePape's activities woke up Paul, and when confronted, DePape said that he wanted to

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
speak to Nancy.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,960
Paul said she wasn't home, and DePape replied, I'll wait.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,340
Paul claimed that he had to go to the bathroom, and once alone, he called 911.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,540
With the line open, he began to loudly ask, why are you here, what are you going to do

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,120
to me, which prompted the dispatcher to send the cops.

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,180
Once the police arrived, they knocked on the door.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,980
Paul opened it and began to struggle with DePape in the doorway over a hammer in DePape's

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
hands.

25
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,460
The cops told both men to drop the weapon, but DePape won the struggle and cracked Paul

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,460
over the head with it.

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,620
Shortly after, DePape was tackled by the cops.

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,140
It was discovered that he had on him zip ties, duct tape, rope, a second hammer, gloves,

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,380
and a list of targets.

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,960
Paul Pelosi was taken to the hospital for surgery to treat the skull fracture that the

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,260
hammer blow had caused.

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,760
He remained out of the public eye until a week ago, where he finally appeared at an

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,200
official event with his wife.

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
The extent of his injuries were enough that he had to wear a hat to conceal them.

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,000
Statements given to the police by DePape reveal that the attack was politically motivated,

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,920
though I'm not sure you needed to think too hard to figure that out.

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,480
DePape sees Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the pack of liars that is the Democratic Party,

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,260
and his actions were to fight tyranny.

39
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,760
His plan was to kidnap and interrogate Pelosi, specifically that he would break her kneecaps

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,360
if she didn't tell the truth, so that she would have to appear in public in a wheelchair.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,840
He also considered his mission to be a suicidal one.

42
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,840
And nobody else is going to say it, so I will.

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,440
This guy looks like Gigachad if he had Down Syndrome.

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,020
Though the police hadn't known about DePape before the attack, which is a bit surprising

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,380
considering how often the feds have somebody on their radar but still fail to stop them

46
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,140
in time, we actually do know quite a bit about DePape's life before the event.

47
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,920
He migrated to the US after high school and resurfaced with public nudist activist Gypsy

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,300
Taub in Hawaii.

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,400
At some point, they entered into a relationship, and when Taub moved to San Francisco, DePape

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
followed.

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,840
Taub became a prominent figure in public nudity activism, and by 2013, when Taub was at the

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,640
height of her fame and recognition, DePape was often seen among her entourage.

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,320
However, also by 2013, Taub and DePape had broken up.

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,600
DePape seems to have continued hanging around her because she was a rising star in that

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,260
community, and he still gained some influence through her.

56
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,280
But also probably because he still had feelings for her.

57
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,280
He was the groomsman in her wedding to someone else, and for a while, he lived in the same

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,900
house as Taub, her husband, and her three children, selling hemp bracelets to make money.

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,980
Taub and DePape would continue an on-off relationship until 2015, when Taub finally broke it off

60
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
for good.

61
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,700
At that point, DePape became homeless.

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,180
He had already been struggling with various mental health problems ever since leaving

63
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,200
high school, but while homeless, things really began to get worse for him.

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,020
He exhibited paranoia, megalomania, and drug abuse while with Taub, but it all went overdrive

65
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,800
after he joined San Francisco's homeless population.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,860
By the time of the attack on Paul Pelosi, he had managed to make his way to Richmond,

67
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,720
renting out a garage to live in and working as a handyman.

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,060
The entire activist group that DePape had associated with in the 2000s and early 2010s

69
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,720
had fully collapsed by 2017, and its members have all suffered similar fates as DePape.

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,540
Mental health problems, drugs, poverty, and run-ins with the law.

71
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,480
Gypsy Taub herself was arrested in 2019 and tossed in jail in 2021 for attempted child

72
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,320
abduction, stalking, and child abuse of a 14-year-old boy who had been friends with

73
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
one of her sons.

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,280
Taub had been trying to convince the boy to run away from his family and join hers.

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,040
Gypsy Taub, who is now in her 50s, seems to have always enjoyed the company of young men.

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,140
DePape was 20 when they were first spotted together in real life, and her former husband

77
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,220
was also 20 at the time of their marriage, though there is shaky evidence that she had

78
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,680
contact with both of them when they were still underage.

79
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,140
In DePape's case, through the internet as he was still in Canada at the time, DePape's

80
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,620
family said that after high school, DePape followed a woman to the United States and

81
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
vanished.

82
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,180
This is just my opinion because the evidence is incomplete, but Gypsy Taub sounds like

83
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,020
a pedophile and a pervert who like the idea of having sexual access to a stable of underage

84
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,300
boys and barely legal men, and her, her partners, and her activists are all now leading ruined

85
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,380
lives of substance abuse, sexual degeneracy, and incarceration.

86
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,060
That's not to say that I think DePape's innocent of what he did to Paul Pelosi, like

87
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,480
it's all Taub's fault or something.

88
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,060
No, no, he's still responsible.

89
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,840
But considering how conspiracy-brained their group was, with 9-11 truther shit and God

90
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,360
knows what else, I am not surprised this is where DePape ended up.

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,000
DePape's social media use gives us insight into the conspiracy claims.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,040
Initially, his blog posts were all about lefty-style hippy-dippy spirituality, use of psychedelics,

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
that sort of stuff.

94
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,440
This led him down a far-left rabbit hole where he began to get into the anti-government 9-11

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,520
truther stuff that is common at the fringes of politics on all sides.

96
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,580
He emerged on the far right, stating in a blog post made a month before the attack that

97
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,740
Gamergate had radicalized him.

98
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,660
You know, I'm never going to not laugh at Gamergate getting brought up in the year of

99
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,500
our lord 2022.

100
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,100
All gamers did was tell feminist journos to stop being corrupt fucks a decade ago, and

101
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,940
since then it's become a global boogeyman for the leftoids.

102
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,300
Guys, guys, if Nancy Pelosi would just stop sucking off journalists for positive coverage,

103
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,700
this could have all been avoided.

104
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,020
It's incredible how delusional these people are.

105
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,100
Okay, let's actually consider the claim though.

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,540
Is it possible that Gamergate radicalized a Pape, as so many of these bottom-of-the-barrel

107
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,980
game journos like to claim?

108
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,700
The answer is probably not.

109
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,240
Though Gamergate did have its more radical elements, who went on to do more radical political

110
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,520
activism, most notably Milo, most people who talked about Gamergate stuff didn't actually

111
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,240
care about political radicalism.

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,580
They weren't there to subvert the movement and take it over.

113
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,540
They were actually legitimately talking about either the ethical concerns or the feminist

114
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,080
push into the gaming space.

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,780
That second one is certainly political, but I don't think that seeing some corrupt video

116
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,840
game feminists acting shitty is what caused a Pape to pick up a hammer and whack Paul

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,160
Pelosi over the head a decade later.

118
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,840
If I had to guess, literally every other influence throughout his fucked-up life had more to

119
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,380
do with it than Gamergate.

120
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,040
There's a populist pipeline that moves people around the fridges of politics without them

121
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,060
ever actually crossing through the liberal conservative center.

122
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,260
If your baseline point of view is, I don't trust any of society's institutions by default,

123
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,240
everyone and everything is always corrupt and there's no fixing it within the system,

124
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,580
it's very easy for socialists to become fascists, to become libertarians and vice-versa simply

125
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,760
by switching the targets of their ire.

126
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,800
Their reasoning remains the same, they've simply changed what team they play for.

127
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,820
That's not to say that there's never a time to distrust an institution, there certainly

128
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,860
is, and we need the corrective mechanism of the fringes for the center to function.

129
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,300
But the problems begin to start when the fringes become mainline politics.

130
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,480
It's for this reason that I think to Pape's very unorthodox life led him down a conspiracy

131
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
rabbit hole.

132
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,020
When the popular conspiracies were predominantly left-wing hippie drug bullshit, he was a leftist,

133
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,300
and when those conspiracies shifted towards right-wing QAnon bullshit, he became a rightist.

134
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,640
Had he stayed out of trouble long enough to see another political realignment, he likely

135
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,420
would have gone down that path along with it.

136
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,260
So when the leftoids say that Pape was radicalized by Gamergate, that's clearly just cope.

137
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,900
But it's not like the rightoids weren't huffing their own copium on this case as well.

138
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,340
Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter,

139
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,820
The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and derange conspiracy

140
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
theories.

141
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,660
It's shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result.

142
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,240
As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.

143
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,000
Elon Musk replied with this now-deleted tweet,

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,060
There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye, with

145
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,060
a link to an article on the Santa Monica Observer.

146
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,900
You can tell that this is a tabloid rag just by the length of the headline.

147
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
The awful truth.

148
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,500
Paul Pelosi was struck on the head with a hammer by a lunatic early Friday morning.

149
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,200
Paul Pelosi stated that he doesn't know who the male is, but he advised that his name

150
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,880
is David and that he's a friend.

151
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Yeah, right.

152
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Jesus.

153
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,040
Alright, let's take a look.

154
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Authorities have changed their story of the Friday morning break-in at the Pelosi's

155
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,700
home several times, making it more difficult to understand the strange and heinous crime.

156
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,620
Authorities now call the idea that the two men knew each other ridiculous.

157
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,320
But none of the various versions explain how suspect and victim ended up holding the same

158
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,960
hammer in front of the police, or why they didn't shoot and kill the suspect before

159
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,280
he struck Paul Pelosi.

160
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
As Megyn Kelly said,

161
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,520
I smell a rat here, meaning the various stories don't add up.

162
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Why was DePape in his underwear?

163
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,580
Why were none of these security cameras working?

164
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,280
What happened to the third-party witness who was there in the first version of events?

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,240
Who opened the door to let in the police?

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,640
Why did DePape, a psychopathic criminal, grant Pelosi a bathroom break, during which he called

167
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,760
911 and described DePape as a friend?

168
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,680
Why didn't Pelosi lock himself in the bathroom until the San Francisco Police Department

169
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
arrived?

170
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,460
Was there a third person at the seven-bedroom residence?

171
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,840
And what happened to that person?

172
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,440
On the right, there's a belief that DePape was actually the secret gay lover of Paul

173
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Pelosi.

174
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,680
Their fight was a lover's spat, and that the whole thing is just a massive cover-up

175
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,920
of that scandal, due to the 2022 midterms being just around the corner at the time.

176
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,880
The issue is, none of that seems to be true.

177
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,680
There's memes about how the window DePape broke to enter the house had glass on the

178
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,880
outside so clearly it wasn't from someone breaking in.

179
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
But that's just not true.

180
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,360
If you've ever broken a window, you should know that not all of the glass goes in with

181
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,480
the force of the break.

182
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,960
In fact, some will be expelled back out due to that same force.

183
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,820
It's kind of like ripples in the surface of the water, where the first wave after you

184
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,020
toss something into the water rises above the surface due to displacement.

185
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
And you know what?

186
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Rhytoids should know this.

187
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,240
I know you guys have autistically examined riot footage of antifa goons smashing shit

188
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,540
up, and there's always glass on the outside of the windows that they break.

189
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,900
But the glass contention is the only part of this alternative story that is based on

190
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,060
physical evidence.

191
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,080
The rest of it comes from that shitty Santa Monica article, which is of dubious trustworthiness.

192
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,780
I know that Dinesh D'Souza, Steve Bannon, Elon Musk, and a bunch of other people have

193
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,040
repeated the claim, but they all got their claims from this one source.

194
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,180
And here is what that source reads.

195
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,920
Okay, so here's the theory, as related to me by a source.

196
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,140
Castro nudists are a group of really radical gay male prostitutes that parade around naked

197
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,460
with cock rings.

198
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,820
First of all, the police did not come in response to an alarm.

199
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,580
They came in response to a wellness check.

200
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,220
So someone had to call them to check on Pelosi.

201
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,140
When Pelosi didn't answer the phone, the cops broke the sliding glass door to get in.

202
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,100
Pelosi was struggling with a suspect who was in his underwear, related to this guy by a

203
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
source.

204
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Come on, guys.

205
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,200
If you shit on mainstream journals for saying that an anonymous source told me the story

206
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,620
and I can't tell you who it is, but it's totally true, how could you possibly trust this buffoon?

207
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,400
Well, to me, the answer is obvious.

208
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,840
The right can be just as ideologically motivated as the left to believe stories that help them

209
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,820
and discard stories that hurt them regardless of the truth.

210
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,480
And of course, being signal boosted by big name rightoids on Twitter also helps.

211
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,280
But there's just no evidence here.

212
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,560
There's no evidence that anyone was in their underwear.

213
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,960
The paper was dressed and Pelosi was in his pajamas.

214
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,080
There's no evidence that it was a secret gay meetup.

215
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,440
There's no evidence that there was a third person in the house.

216
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,280
No evidence that the paper was working as a Castro nudist prostitute.

217
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,660
That just seems to be a weird game of telephone style misinterpretation of his past as a leftist

218
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,800
nudist activist.

219
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,680
The claim that Pelosi said to Pape was a friend on the 911 call is also false, as both the

220
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,560
FBI's investigation into the call confirmed that Pelosi didn't know who to Pape was.

221
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,200
And Pelosi also later stated to the police in the ambulance that he had never seen to

222
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Pape before.

223
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,160
Some of this stuff is actually excusable.

224
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,880
During the initial hours of a breaking story, there's often jumbled contradictory information,

225
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,560
and we can generally expect the truth to shake out as more info is revealed.

226
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
Many news outlets reported on some of this stuff, only to issue backtracks and apologies

227
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,820
as new information became available.

228
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,420
For example, this report from MSNBC repeated a Department of Justice claim that the police,

229
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,360
not Pelosi, opened the front door.

230
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,660
After a knock and announce, the front door was opened by Mr. Pelosi.

231
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,520
The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency or tried to leave his home, but

232
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,040
instead began walking several feet back into the foyer, toward the assailant, and away

233
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
from police.

234
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,000
It's unclear if the 82-year-old was already injured or what his mental state was, say

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
sources.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,740
According to court documents, when the officer asked what was going on, defendants smiled

237
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,860
and said, everything's good.

238
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,100
But instantaneously, a struggle ensued as police clearly saw David DePape strike Paul

239
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,300
Pelosi in the head with a hammer.

240
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,960
After tackling the suspect, officers rushed to Mr. Pelosi, who was lying in a pool of

241
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
blood.

242
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,760
What we do know is he brutally attacked Mr. Pelosi and attempted to kill him.

243
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,560
Why Pelosi didn't try to flee or tell responding officers he was in distress is unclear.

244
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,780
Fear takes over.

245
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,080
Fear freezes people.

246
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,300
It came out later that the DOJ was incorrect, and police body cam footage showed that Pelosi

247
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,840
opened the front door instead.

248
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,340
The online right took this to mean that now that the midterms are over, the real story

249
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,340
about Pelosi's hidden gay relationship was finally going to come out.

250
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,420
But while that made for a funny meme, it never actually happened.

251
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,760
The body cam footage hasn't yet been made public, likely due to legal reasons related

252
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,220
to evidence in the upcoming trial.

253
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,340
But everyone who's watched it says that Pelosi answered the door, he was acting erratically,

254
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,580
likely out of fear, and then got smashed in the head by DePape's hammer.

255
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,380
Now, it is possible that they're all just lying, that all of these sources are keeping

256
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,500
what was really on the body cam footage secret.

257
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,320
The politicians, the cops, the FBI, all the news outlets, the journos, everyone, they're

258
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
all colluding to cover it all up.

259
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,320
And until we see the body cam footage for ourselves, we can't truly know.

260
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
But frankly, I doubt it.

261
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,640
It doesn't seem plausible to me.

262
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
The leaps of logic are just too great.

263
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,040
I feel like the body cam footage is going to be released at some point, once it's

264
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,840
legally possible, or get leaked, so all we've got to do is wait it out.

265
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,420
I might have my foot in my mouth in this one, but I don't think so, especially since most

266
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,800
of the evidence lines up with my interpretation of events.

267
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,080
DePape isn't Paul Pelosi's secret gay lover, he's just a conspiracy-brained populoid

268
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,700
who has entirely fucked his life up with nearly 25 years of bad decisions, and an innocent

269
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
old man has paid the price for it.

270
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,460
People are also saying that Nancy Pelosi's decision to step down as Democratic House

271
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,140
Leader is also a result of the attack, and therefore that, in some way, DePape got at

272
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,660
least a little bit of what he wanted.

273
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,980
But I don't buy this either.

274
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,700
Nancy Pelosi looks like a walking fucking corpse, guys.

275
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,820
Dude, look at that shadow, how do her eyes even stay in her head?

276
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,140
It's time for her to start winding down, guys.

277
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,180
No conspiracy needed on this one, she's got one foot in the grave, and the other one

278
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,180
was made out of plastic.

279
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,200
I've always found Nancy Pelosi to be kind of cringe personally, her policies can be

280
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
hit and miss, but as a person she just seems slimy, and all of that dem worship from the

281
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,480
left doesn't make it any better.

282
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,960
But none of that makes any sort of violence against her husband acceptable, and trying

283
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,000
to twist the story into some sort of gay prostitution scandal based on literally nothing because

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,160
it serves your political interests is pretty scummy, guys.

285
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,240
Paul Pelosi actually did nothing wrong.

286
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,840
He's not responsible for anything his wife did, he's certainly the victim of what DePape

287
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
did.

288
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,860
And let's hope DePape is locked up for the rest of his life like the shitheel he is.

289
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Okay, listen.

290
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,000
You're watching this on release at 8-30pm EST, tonight I'm doing finally, after like

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,620
over a month of not doing it, the community movie nights.

292
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,100
You're in the five dollar club?

293
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,300
Get yourself into the masterpiece theater, we're watching a movie tonight.

294
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
I'll see you there, guys.

295
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,800
I love you.
