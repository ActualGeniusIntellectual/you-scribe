0	10300	Back when I was spending my days coughing up coronavirus-infused phlegm, a pretty notable
10300	11740	event hit the news cycle.
11740	15300	It came and went, and now nobody even thinks about it anymore, beyond the occasional meme.
15300	20060	I'm talking about the attack on former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul
20060	21060	Pelosi.
21060	23780	One of the good things about being bedridden is that I can actually examine this event
23780	27700	with some distance and objectivity, unlike every other monkey who just spits out whatever
27700	29820	was the most politically convenient take for them.
29820	33560	Alternatively, I could also just be writing an older script that I was too sick to finish
33560	35240	in order to recoup some lost work hours.
35240	36240	Who's to say?
36240	37840	Here's the official account of what happened.
37840	42080	David DePape, a Canadian—don't go blaming us for this, guys—broke into Nancy Pelosi's
42080	45480	house by smashing through glass-paneled doors in the back.
45480	49480	Nancy wasn't home, but her husband, Paul Pelosi, was asleep in a third-floor bedroom.
49480	53080	DePape's activities woke up Paul, and when confronted, DePape said that he wanted to
53080	54080	speak to Nancy.
54080	56960	Paul said she wasn't home, and DePape replied, I'll wait.
57100	60340	Paul claimed that he had to go to the bathroom, and once alone, he called 911.
60340	63540	With the line open, he began to loudly ask, why are you here, what are you going to do
63540	66120	to me, which prompted the dispatcher to send the cops.
66120	68180	Once the police arrived, they knocked on the door.
68180	71980	Paul opened it and began to struggle with DePape in the doorway over a hammer in DePape's
71980	72980	hands.
72980	76460	The cops told both men to drop the weapon, but DePape won the struggle and cracked Paul
76460	77460	over the head with it.
77460	79620	Shortly after, DePape was tackled by the cops.
79620	84140	It was discovered that he had on him zip ties, duct tape, rope, a second hammer, gloves,
84140	85380	and a list of targets.
85380	88960	Paul Pelosi was taken to the hospital for surgery to treat the skull fracture that the
88960	90260	hammer blow had caused.
90260	93760	He remained out of the public eye until a week ago, where he finally appeared at an
93760	95200	official event with his wife.
95200	98880	The extent of his injuries were enough that he had to wear a hat to conceal them.
98880	103000	Statements given to the police by DePape reveal that the attack was politically motivated,
103000	105920	though I'm not sure you needed to think too hard to figure that out.
105920	110480	DePape sees Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the pack of liars that is the Democratic Party,
110480	112260	and his actions were to fight tyranny.
112260	116760	His plan was to kidnap and interrogate Pelosi, specifically that he would break her kneecaps
116760	120360	if she didn't tell the truth, so that she would have to appear in public in a wheelchair.
120360	122840	He also considered his mission to be a suicidal one.
122840	124840	And nobody else is going to say it, so I will.
124840	127440	This guy looks like Gigachad if he had Down Syndrome.
127440	131020	Though the police hadn't known about DePape before the attack, which is a bit surprising
131020	134380	considering how often the feds have somebody on their radar but still fail to stop them
134380	138140	in time, we actually do know quite a bit about DePape's life before the event.
138140	142920	He migrated to the US after high school and resurfaced with public nudist activist Gypsy
142920	144300	Taub in Hawaii.
144300	148400	At some point, they entered into a relationship, and when Taub moved to San Francisco, DePape
148400	149400	followed.
149400	153840	Taub became a prominent figure in public nudity activism, and by 2013, when Taub was at the
153840	157640	height of her fame and recognition, DePape was often seen among her entourage.
157640	161320	However, also by 2013, Taub and DePape had broken up.
161320	165600	DePape seems to have continued hanging around her because she was a rising star in that
165600	168260	community, and he still gained some influence through her.
168260	170280	But also probably because he still had feelings for her.
170280	174280	He was the groomsman in her wedding to someone else, and for a while, he lived in the same
174280	178900	house as Taub, her husband, and her three children, selling hemp bracelets to make money.
178900	183980	Taub and DePape would continue an on-off relationship until 2015, when Taub finally broke it off
183980	184980	for good.
184980	186700	At that point, DePape became homeless.
186700	190180	He had already been struggling with various mental health problems ever since leaving
190180	193200	high school, but while homeless, things really began to get worse for him.
193200	198020	He exhibited paranoia, megalomania, and drug abuse while with Taub, but it all went overdrive
198020	200800	after he joined San Francisco's homeless population.
200800	204860	By the time of the attack on Paul Pelosi, he had managed to make his way to Richmond,
204860	207720	renting out a garage to live in and working as a handyman.
207720	212060	The entire activist group that DePape had associated with in the 2000s and early 2010s
212060	216720	had fully collapsed by 2017, and its members have all suffered similar fates as DePape.
216720	219540	Mental health problems, drugs, poverty, and run-ins with the law.
219540	224480	Gypsy Taub herself was arrested in 2019 and tossed in jail in 2021 for attempted child
224480	228320	abduction, stalking, and child abuse of a 14-year-old boy who had been friends with
228320	229320	one of her sons.
229320	233280	Taub had been trying to convince the boy to run away from his family and join hers.
233280	238040	Gypsy Taub, who is now in her 50s, seems to have always enjoyed the company of young men.
238040	242140	DePape was 20 when they were first spotted together in real life, and her former husband
242140	246220	was also 20 at the time of their marriage, though there is shaky evidence that she had
246220	248680	contact with both of them when they were still underage.
248680	252140	In DePape's case, through the internet as he was still in Canada at the time, DePape's
252140	255620	family said that after high school, DePape followed a woman to the United States and
255620	256620	vanished.
256620	260180	This is just my opinion because the evidence is incomplete, but Gypsy Taub sounds like
260180	265020	a pedophile and a pervert who like the idea of having sexual access to a stable of underage
265020	270300	boys and barely legal men, and her, her partners, and her activists are all now leading ruined
270300	273380	lives of substance abuse, sexual degeneracy, and incarceration.
273380	277060	That's not to say that I think DePape's innocent of what he did to Paul Pelosi, like
277060	278480	it's all Taub's fault or something.
278480	280060	No, no, he's still responsible.
280060	284840	But considering how conspiracy-brained their group was, with 9-11 truther shit and God
284840	288360	knows what else, I am not surprised this is where DePape ended up.
288360	292000	DePape's social media use gives us insight into the conspiracy claims.
292000	297040	Initially, his blog posts were all about lefty-style hippy-dippy spirituality, use of psychedelics,
297040	298040	that sort of stuff.
298040	302440	This led him down a far-left rabbit hole where he began to get into the anti-government 9-11
302440	305520	truther stuff that is common at the fringes of politics on all sides.
305520	309580	He emerged on the far right, stating in a blog post made a month before the attack that
309580	311740	Gamergate had radicalized him.
311740	315660	You know, I'm never going to not laugh at Gamergate getting brought up in the year of
315660	317500	our lord 2022.
317500	322100	All gamers did was tell feminist journos to stop being corrupt fucks a decade ago, and
322100	324940	since then it's become a global boogeyman for the leftoids.
324940	329300	Guys, guys, if Nancy Pelosi would just stop sucking off journalists for positive coverage,
329300	330700	this could have all been avoided.
330700	333020	It's incredible how delusional these people are.
333020	335100	Okay, let's actually consider the claim though.
335100	339540	Is it possible that Gamergate radicalized a Pape, as so many of these bottom-of-the-barrel
339540	340980	game journos like to claim?
340980	342700	The answer is probably not.
342700	347240	Though Gamergate did have its more radical elements, who went on to do more radical political
347240	351520	activism, most notably Milo, most people who talked about Gamergate stuff didn't actually
351520	353240	care about political radicalism.
353240	355580	They weren't there to subvert the movement and take it over.
355580	359540	They were actually legitimately talking about either the ethical concerns or the feminist
359540	361080	push into the gaming space.
361080	364780	That second one is certainly political, but I don't think that seeing some corrupt video
364780	368840	game feminists acting shitty is what caused a Pape to pick up a hammer and whack Paul
368840	371160	Pelosi over the head a decade later.
371160	375840	If I had to guess, literally every other influence throughout his fucked-up life had more to
375840	377380	do with it than Gamergate.
377380	381040	There's a populist pipeline that moves people around the fridges of politics without them
381040	384060	ever actually crossing through the liberal conservative center.
384060	389260	If your baseline point of view is, I don't trust any of society's institutions by default,
389260	393240	everyone and everything is always corrupt and there's no fixing it within the system,
393240	397580	it's very easy for socialists to become fascists, to become libertarians and vice-versa simply
397580	399760	by switching the targets of their ire.
399760	403800	Their reasoning remains the same, they've simply changed what team they play for.
403800	406820	That's not to say that there's never a time to distrust an institution, there certainly
406820	410860	is, and we need the corrective mechanism of the fringes for the center to function.
410860	414300	But the problems begin to start when the fringes become mainline politics.
414300	418480	It's for this reason that I think to Pape's very unorthodox life led him down a conspiracy
418480	419480	rabbit hole.
419480	424020	When the popular conspiracies were predominantly left-wing hippie drug bullshit, he was a leftist,
424020	428300	and when those conspiracies shifted towards right-wing QAnon bullshit, he became a rightist.
428300	431640	Had he stayed out of trouble long enough to see another political realignment, he likely
431640	433420	would have gone down that path along with it.
433420	438260	So when the leftoids say that Pape was radicalized by Gamergate, that's clearly just cope.
438260	441900	But it's not like the rightoids weren't huffing their own copium on this case as well.
441900	443340	Hillary Clinton posted on Twitter,
443340	447820	The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and derange conspiracy
447820	448820	theories.
448820	451660	It's shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result.
451660	455240	As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.
455240	458000	Elon Musk replied with this now-deleted tweet,
458000	462060	There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye, with
462060	465060	a link to an article on the Santa Monica Observer.
465060	468900	You can tell that this is a tabloid rag just by the length of the headline.
468900	469900	The awful truth.
469900	473500	Paul Pelosi was struck on the head with a hammer by a lunatic early Friday morning.
473500	477200	Paul Pelosi stated that he doesn't know who the male is, but he advised that his name
477200	478880	is David and that he's a friend.
478880	479880	Yeah, right.
479880	480880	Jesus.
480880	482040	Alright, let's take a look.
482040	485160	Authorities have changed their story of the Friday morning break-in at the Pelosi's
485160	489700	home several times, making it more difficult to understand the strange and heinous crime.
489700	492620	Authorities now call the idea that the two men knew each other ridiculous.
492620	497320	But none of the various versions explain how suspect and victim ended up holding the same
497320	500960	hammer in front of the police, or why they didn't shoot and kill the suspect before
500960	502280	he struck Paul Pelosi.
502280	503280	As Megyn Kelly said,
503280	506520	I smell a rat here, meaning the various stories don't add up.
506520	508320	Why was DePape in his underwear?
508320	510580	Why were none of these security cameras working?
510580	514280	What happened to the third-party witness who was there in the first version of events?
514280	516240	Who opened the door to let in the police?
516240	521640	Why did DePape, a psychopathic criminal, grant Pelosi a bathroom break, during which he called
521640	524760	911 and described DePape as a friend?
524760	528680	Why didn't Pelosi lock himself in the bathroom until the San Francisco Police Department
528680	529680	arrived?
529680	531460	Was there a third person at the seven-bedroom residence?
531460	532840	And what happened to that person?
532840	536440	On the right, there's a belief that DePape was actually the secret gay lover of Paul
536440	537440	Pelosi.
537440	540680	Their fight was a lover's spat, and that the whole thing is just a massive cover-up
540680	544920	of that scandal, due to the 2022 midterms being just around the corner at the time.
544920	546880	The issue is, none of that seems to be true.
546880	550680	There's memes about how the window DePape broke to enter the house had glass on the
550680	552880	outside so clearly it wasn't from someone breaking in.
552880	554480	But that's just not true.
554480	558360	If you've ever broken a window, you should know that not all of the glass goes in with
558360	559480	the force of the break.
559480	562960	In fact, some will be expelled back out due to that same force.
562960	565820	It's kind of like ripples in the surface of the water, where the first wave after you
565820	570020	toss something into the water rises above the surface due to displacement.
570020	571020	And you know what?
571020	572020	Rhytoids should know this.
572020	576240	I know you guys have autistically examined riot footage of antifa goons smashing shit
576240	579540	up, and there's always glass on the outside of the windows that they break.
579540	583900	But the glass contention is the only part of this alternative story that is based on
583900	585060	physical evidence.
585060	590080	The rest of it comes from that shitty Santa Monica article, which is of dubious trustworthiness.
590080	593780	I know that Dinesh D'Souza, Steve Bannon, Elon Musk, and a bunch of other people have
593780	598040	repeated the claim, but they all got their claims from this one source.
598040	600180	And here is what that source reads.
600180	603920	Okay, so here's the theory, as related to me by a source.
603920	609140	Castro nudists are a group of really radical gay male prostitutes that parade around naked
609140	610460	with cock rings.
610460	612820	First of all, the police did not come in response to an alarm.
612820	614580	They came in response to a wellness check.
614580	617220	So someone had to call them to check on Pelosi.
617220	621140	When Pelosi didn't answer the phone, the cops broke the sliding glass door to get in.
621140	625100	Pelosi was struggling with a suspect who was in his underwear, related to this guy by a
625100	626100	source.
626100	627100	Come on, guys.
627100	631200	If you shit on mainstream journals for saying that an anonymous source told me the story
631200	635620	and I can't tell you who it is, but it's totally true, how could you possibly trust this buffoon?
635620	637400	Well, to me, the answer is obvious.
637400	641840	The right can be just as ideologically motivated as the left to believe stories that help them
641840	644820	and discard stories that hurt them regardless of the truth.
644820	648480	And of course, being signal boosted by big name rightoids on Twitter also helps.
648480	650280	But there's just no evidence here.
650280	652560	There's no evidence that anyone was in their underwear.
652560	654960	The paper was dressed and Pelosi was in his pajamas.
654960	657080	There's no evidence that it was a secret gay meetup.
657080	659440	There's no evidence that there was a third person in the house.
659440	663280	No evidence that the paper was working as a Castro nudist prostitute.
663280	667660	That just seems to be a weird game of telephone style misinterpretation of his past as a leftist
667660	668800	nudist activist.
668800	673680	The claim that Pelosi said to Pape was a friend on the 911 call is also false, as both the
673680	678560	FBI's investigation into the call confirmed that Pelosi didn't know who to Pape was.
678560	682200	And Pelosi also later stated to the police in the ambulance that he had never seen to
682200	683200	Pape before.
683200	685160	Some of this stuff is actually excusable.
685160	688880	During the initial hours of a breaking story, there's often jumbled contradictory information,
688880	692560	and we can generally expect the truth to shake out as more info is revealed.
692560	696160	Many news outlets reported on some of this stuff, only to issue backtracks and apologies
696160	697820	as new information became available.
697820	702420	For example, this report from MSNBC repeated a Department of Justice claim that the police,
702420	704360	not Pelosi, opened the front door.
704360	708660	After a knock and announce, the front door was opened by Mr. Pelosi.
708660	714520	The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency or tried to leave his home, but
714520	720040	instead began walking several feet back into the foyer, toward the assailant, and away
720040	721040	from police.
721040	727000	It's unclear if the 82-year-old was already injured or what his mental state was, say
727000	728000	sources.
728000	733740	According to court documents, when the officer asked what was going on, defendants smiled
733740	735860	and said, everything's good.
735860	742100	But instantaneously, a struggle ensued as police clearly saw David DePape strike Paul
742100	745300	Pelosi in the head with a hammer.
745300	750960	After tackling the suspect, officers rushed to Mr. Pelosi, who was lying in a pool of
750960	751960	blood.
751960	757760	What we do know is he brutally attacked Mr. Pelosi and attempted to kill him.
757760	764560	Why Pelosi didn't try to flee or tell responding officers he was in distress is unclear.
764560	765780	Fear takes over.
765780	767080	Fear freezes people.
767080	771300	It came out later that the DOJ was incorrect, and police body cam footage showed that Pelosi
771300	772840	opened the front door instead.
772840	776340	The online right took this to mean that now that the midterms are over, the real story
776340	779340	about Pelosi's hidden gay relationship was finally going to come out.
779340	782420	But while that made for a funny meme, it never actually happened.
782420	785760	The body cam footage hasn't yet been made public, likely due to legal reasons related
785760	787220	to evidence in the upcoming trial.
787220	791340	But everyone who's watched it says that Pelosi answered the door, he was acting erratically,
791340	794580	likely out of fear, and then got smashed in the head by DePape's hammer.
794580	798380	Now, it is possible that they're all just lying, that all of these sources are keeping
798380	800500	what was really on the body cam footage secret.
800500	804320	The politicians, the cops, the FBI, all the news outlets, the journos, everyone, they're
804320	805920	all colluding to cover it all up.
805920	809320	And until we see the body cam footage for ourselves, we can't truly know.
809320	810320	But frankly, I doubt it.
810320	811640	It doesn't seem plausible to me.
811640	813240	The leaps of logic are just too great.
813240	816040	I feel like the body cam footage is going to be released at some point, once it's
816040	818840	legally possible, or get leaked, so all we've got to do is wait it out.
818840	822420	I might have my foot in my mouth in this one, but I don't think so, especially since most
822420	824800	of the evidence lines up with my interpretation of events.
824800	829080	DePape isn't Paul Pelosi's secret gay lover, he's just a conspiracy-brained populoid
829080	833700	who has entirely fucked his life up with nearly 25 years of bad decisions, and an innocent
833700	835700	old man has paid the price for it.
835700	839460	People are also saying that Nancy Pelosi's decision to step down as Democratic House
839460	844140	Leader is also a result of the attack, and therefore that, in some way, DePape got at
844140	845660	least a little bit of what he wanted.
845660	846980	But I don't buy this either.
846980	849700	Nancy Pelosi looks like a walking fucking corpse, guys.
849700	852820	Dude, look at that shadow, how do her eyes even stay in her head?
852820	855140	It's time for her to start winding down, guys.
855140	858180	No conspiracy needed on this one, she's got one foot in the grave, and the other one
858180	859180	was made out of plastic.
859180	862200	I've always found Nancy Pelosi to be kind of cringe personally, her policies can be
862200	866200	hit and miss, but as a person she just seems slimy, and all of that dem worship from the
866200	867480	left doesn't make it any better.
867480	870960	But none of that makes any sort of violence against her husband acceptable, and trying
870960	876000	to twist the story into some sort of gay prostitution scandal based on literally nothing because
876000	879160	it serves your political interests is pretty scummy, guys.
879160	881240	Paul Pelosi actually did nothing wrong.
881240	884840	He's not responsible for anything his wife did, he's certainly the victim of what DePape
884840	885840	did.
885840	889860	And let's hope DePape is locked up for the rest of his life like the shitheel he is.
889860	890860	Okay, listen.
890860	896000	You're watching this on release at 8-30pm EST, tonight I'm doing finally, after like
896000	898620	over a month of not doing it, the community movie nights.
898620	900100	You're in the five dollar club?
900100	902300	Get yourself into the masterpiece theater, we're watching a movie tonight.
902300	903300	I'll see you there, guys.
903300	903800	I love you.
