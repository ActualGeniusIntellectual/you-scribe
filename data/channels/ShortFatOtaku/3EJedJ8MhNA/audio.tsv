0	10160	Hello my friends, it's the end of the year and I've got a spare 30 minutes or so, so
10160	13040	I'm going to record this video off the cuff for you.
13040	16300	Inspired by my friend Anna's Twitter post here.
16300	20540	What was your favorite low IQ Twitter discourse this year?
20540	23020	This is the low IQ Twitter awards, guys.
23020	26540	And there are a lot of good ones in here, like for example, Abolish Kitchens.
26540	27540	I remember that stuff.
27540	28540	I think he even replied.
28540	32180	Mommy's wanting the communal kitchens of the Soviet Union back because owning your
32180	36180	own kitchen is a waste of resources and space and a sign of bourgeois decadence.
36180	37500	Yeah, that was a thing.
37500	40780	I recall someone saying, no one needs a kitchen.
40780	45900	In fact, no one needs an ex seems to be a common logic with the communists online.
45900	48860	They did the same thing when the Stadia shut down and I was talking about that back in
48860	49860	that video.
49860	53580	There was that one idiot who was like, no one needs a console.
53580	56780	It's more sustainable if we all just run things from Google servers.
56780	58300	It's like, shut the fuck up.
58300	60900	This person, of course, says the same as every year, can't get pride.
60900	63180	That is an especially cancerous discourse.
63180	64180	That's for sure.
64180	65180	EBT fast food.
65180	66180	I don't remember that one.
66180	69100	I'm considering the name of it.
69100	70660	Maybe I'm happy that it didn't happen.
70660	73420	NFTs are transphrenology in sports.
73420	74420	Oh God.
74420	75720	Oh yeah.
75720	78140	The whole restaurants are exploitative thing.
78140	82860	Like the idea of restaurants and after the revolution, everyone will cook their own food.
82860	83860	You can do that now.
83860	85700	And actually I've seen the inverse too.
85700	88820	I've seen the inverse where people were saying like, after the revolution, you will simply
88820	90780	order food from a centralized source.
90780	91780	Oh yeah.
91780	93240	The anarchist supply chains.
93240	98100	This was like when doe and demon mama were fighting over because they're both like, and
98100	100000	comms, you know, anarcho communists.
100000	104220	They wanted to like destroy supply chains and prevent goods from being moved around.
104220	110380	And it's like, how, how do you, how, how do you expect to redistribute if you have no
110380	115100	supply chains, you fucking morons, those kids don't look those people up, by the way, they're
115100	117340	literally the dumbest people on the internet.
117340	118500	It's not fucking worth it.
118500	119540	Here's one that I remember.
119540	123980	This is from grumpy shrubbery and my God, this makes my brain leak out of my ears.
123980	125120	Unfriendly reminder.
125120	129780	If you claim to advocate on behalf of the mentally ill and or neurodivergent, but exclude
129780	135060	people with personality disorders, particularly narcissistic personality disorder from your
135060	136340	activism, you're an activist.
136340	137340	You're an ableist.
137340	140300	You don't get to pick and choose with which disabilities are worth your time.
140300	143140	You don't have to understand someone's brain to know that ableism is bad.
143140	144140	That's the whole fucking point.
144180	148300	So let me get this straight, if you don't let that narcissist steal everything from
148300	153740	you and then rape your fucking beheaded corpse, you're a, you're being an ableist.
153740	157060	Well sign me up for bigot school, baby.
157060	160740	This person, by the way, grumpy shrubbery, this person's insane.
160740	166100	They regularly have the most terminally online brain rotted takes I've ever seen.
166100	169240	For example, this is their most viral tweet of the year.
169240	172780	It really doesn't sit right with me when people make fun of people who can't cook.
172780	174780	It's not their fault that no one taught them.
174780	178520	And learning any skill as an adult can be really daunting, especially when cookery is
178520	180680	such an overwhelmingly broad concept, ha ha.
180680	182580	They can't even boil an egg.
182580	183720	That's not funny.
183720	184720	It's shit.
184720	185720	They never had an opportunity to learn.
185720	188180	Instead of just providing that opportunity, you're just going to laugh at them.
188180	189580	OMG, get a life.
189580	193100	Having opportunities to learn to cook as a kid is a massive privilege.
193100	198740	Yes, this is the infamous boiling an egg is classist discourse.
198740	201120	The recipe starts by telling you to boil an egg.
201120	202660	You Google how to boil an egg.
202660	204420	It tells you to boil a pot of water.
204420	205420	How much water?
205420	206420	Which pot?
206420	207420	What temperature?
207420	209020	You give up and order a pizza.
209020	211540	Hey, I feel personally called out here.
211540	212660	Everyone's missing the point.
212660	214540	What you see as obvious is not obvious.
214540	215820	I've never taught them.
215820	216820	This is an example.
216820	220860	I know how to boil water, but also set the stove down to the highest temperature isn't
220860	223060	some intuitive thing a person knows.
223060	225260	It's not an instinct.
225260	228420	These people, they seem like they seem like they're like actually retarded.
228420	229940	Like they're actually remedial.
229940	233840	They have to go to the special classroom in school because they can't do the most basic
233840	234840	fucking things.
234840	235840	Okay.
235840	236840	Here's the thing about boiling an egg.
236840	237840	All right.
237840	240180	Assume that you had to boil an egg and assume that all you could do is trial and error.
240180	242940	You have your dozen eggs, you have your water, you have your pot.
242940	246340	Maybe you put the egg, the egg into the pot and then you don't add the water and then
246340	249060	it burns the egg and then your smoke alarm goes off.
249060	250060	Okay.
250060	251060	There's attempt one.
251060	252060	Don't do that.
252060	254420	Maybe you put water and maybe you boil it too much and the egg gets way too hot and
254420	255420	explodes.
255420	257900	That happens sometimes, especially when you take it out of the water.
257900	258900	Okay.
258900	259900	You boil it too much.
259900	262100	And you're learning, you know, the third one, you cook it up.
262100	265300	Maybe you, uh, you cook it too little and then it's kind of raw on the inside.
265300	266300	All right.
266300	267980	You know, people learn it's trial and error.
267980	269860	You don't need to be taught by someone.
269860	276080	You should have the mental faculty to just give something a go and see what sticks, which
276080	278600	is what makes a lot of these conversations.
278600	281040	So like absolutely fucking ridiculous.
281040	286540	You know, just the idea that you should have to have the minimum amount of standards and
286540	288840	just, Hey, maybe, you know, you're an adult now.
288840	293320	You're not this, you know, 15 year old, quirky neurodivergent activist teen.
293320	294320	You're in your twenties.
294320	295920	Now you gotta be taking care of yourself.
295920	296920	You gotta do your own laundry.
296920	298360	You gotta make your own food.
298360	299540	Welcome to being a person.
299540	301720	How about you try a few things and figure it the fuck out.
301720	302720	All right.
302720	304180	At some point it stops being classist.
304180	309140	It stops being ableist and it just becomes regular fucking human living that apparently
309140	310140	you can't do.
310140	311140	It's kind of feels like that.
311140	315160	They them household meme video that I did like six months ago.
315160	317900	I would not want a fucking room with any of these people.
317900	322260	These are the same individuals who blame capitalism or the bourgeois or their landlords
322260	326500	or their parents that they can't hold down jobs or afford mortgages.
326500	329780	If you can't boil an egg, you can't own a fucking house.
329780	332460	And Anna's not the only person doing this sort of thing.
332460	336380	You've got, what was the most chronically online discourse you saw this year?
336380	338340	Mine's gotta be chopping tomatoes as elitist.
338340	339340	Oh my God.
339340	342420	Do I really want to dive down more than one of these threads?
342420	346260	Sometimes every once in a blue moon, I think you guys ask too much of me.
346260	352060	I unironically hate this like infantilization of adults, but like it's not even infantilization
352060	353940	by some kind of overarching authority.
353940	355180	They infantilize themselves.
355180	361100	They, they make themselves look as like as weak and impotent as they possibly can.
361100	362260	Like, look at this, look at this guy.
362260	363260	Hello Seattle.
363260	366500	I haven't left my apartment in over two years due to crippling anxiety and my work from
366500	367500	home job.
367500	369980	Today I finally went out and got an adult happy meal.
369980	370980	Dude.
370980	376080	God, I don't know how, how mean I want to be because there's like the, on the one hand
376080	377980	okay, crippling anxiety.
377980	382320	Good job for actually like taking a step outside and you're doing it, but how in the fuck did
382320	383680	you let it get this bad?
383680	387440	And the worst part is that when older people like Gen X or whatever, they noticed that
387440	390040	this is like the hip new thing with the kids.
390040	393960	And so they purposely do the infantilizing thing as a way to relate.
393960	397480	And it's like, Oh, here, watch this and cringe with me.
397480	399360	It's Monday night and here's what's happened.
399360	402520	V, what are you, what are you doing under my desk?
402520	404040	Well under the desk is kind of my thing.
404040	405980	I mean, but here's the thing.
405980	409460	You can stay for now, but when it comes time to voting, you're going to have to get up
409460	412980	because you've got climate change legislation on the ballot.
412980	418340	You've got gun safety and if we can elect more pro-choice members of Congress, we can
418340	421100	re-institute Roe versus Wade as the law of the land.
421100	422900	So you can't stay here.
422900	426260	You're going to have to take a little bit of time to vote now about time to say that
426260	432300	I voted for McCain in 2008, as long as you voted, this is how the Democrats will keep
432300	433300	winning elections.
433300	434300	Guys.
434620	437900	There's a lot of talkers hiding under tables from the world and Obama coming and sitting
437900	439920	down and being like, it's all right, buddy.
439920	444860	This seems like mentally handicapped advertising for a mentally handicapped generation.
444860	450020	This entire infantilizing sentiment culminated with this video that went viral while I was
450020	451700	off busy being a corpse.
451700	455380	I'm sure you've seen literally everyone else's take on this, so I won't spend too long on
455380	458180	it, but let's at least take a quick view.
458180	464060	People wonder why we need a union at Starbucks and oh my, oh my God, I have to stop right
464060	465060	now.
465060	469380	We're five seconds into the video and I'm already stopping.
469380	470740	Unions have their place, right?
470740	474940	But man, every single one of my experiences with a union has been negative.
474940	478100	And no, you don't need a union at a fast food place.
478100	480320	Like this is not supposed to be a career.
480320	482300	This is a revolving door job.
482300	485440	Use it as a stepping stone, make some quick cash, get the fuck out.
485440	489380	If you're sitting here thinking this is where you're going to be in 10, 20 years, dude,
489380	490660	you got to be shooting higher than this.
490660	494100	I am literally about to quit.
494100	497460	Like I, I don't know if I'm going to do it, but like, I really want to, I almost walked
497460	499180	out today and I'm...
499180	500180	Do it pussy.
500180	501180	Do it.
501180	503340	I'm crying in the bathroom right now and I almost cried on the floor.
503340	508780	It's just, I like, it gets, I'm like a full-time student.
508780	513200	Oh my God, dude, you're, you're a full-time student and you're doing this part-time job
513200	515820	when you got to go into the break room and like cuddle up and cry.
515820	516820	Really?
516820	524740	Welcome to a job, dude.
524740	527020	Like what the...
527020	529940	I'm scheduled part-time, 25 hours a week.
529940	530980	Yeah, it's part-time dude.
530980	532580	On the weekends they got me opening clothes.
532580	533860	They got me doing an eight hour shift.
533860	535260	Yeah, that's an being an adult.
535260	536340	Welcome to regular work.
536340	539980	Regular works, 40 hours a week, nine to five, baby.
539980	544580	Both Saturday and Sunday, I'm like three and a half hours into my shift.
544580	549380	There's so many customers and we have four people on the floor all day.
549380	555140	Oh, oh, you poor, you poor child.
555140	558620	There's work to do at work and I can't handle it.
558620	563100	Only five people were put on the schedule and somebody had to call out and there were
563100	567020	four people running the whole store and there's so many customers and there's possibly scheduled
567020	568420	five people.
568420	569420	Yeah.
569420	571980	Welcome, welcome to the lunch rush at Starbucks.
571980	574540	People are coming in, they want their coffees, they want, I mean, I think it makes sense.
574540	576820	They want their sandwiches or donuts or whatever the fucking Starbucks, you know, most, most
576820	577820	coffee places do that.
577820	578820	You know, people want their food.
578820	580980	This is what you're paid for.
580980	585100	You're paid, I can't believe I have to explain this, you're paid to get the coffee and get
585100	589220	the sandwich and get the donut and then give it to the people who have paid you money for
589220	590220	it.
590220	591220	All right.
591220	592220	Like this is your job.
592220	593980	You're not describing anything that is out of the ordinary.
593980	597380	This is something you should be used to by now that, oh my God, there's people and they
597380	598860	want, they want their food.
598860	600700	Oh, this is terrible.
600700	603140	Karl Marx, save us.
603140	610020	We only have 13 people employed at this store and there's so many customers.
610020	618460	The customers, they're coming like zombies, donuts, coffee, we don't have fair scheduling.
618460	619580	Managers don't care about us.
619580	622900	Our manager was supposed to come in this weekend and he took himself off the schedule so he
622900	625020	wouldn't be able to be held accountable for calling out.
625020	628600	He just literally tore down the schedule that he was scheduled on and put up a new schedule
628600	629600	where he wasn't on the schedule.
629600	633020	Also, he couldn't have even seen that he was scheduled in the first place because he didn't
633020	635260	want to be held accountable for not wanting to come in.
635260	636260	Okay.
636260	637260	Good shot.
637260	638260	Okay.
638260	639260	Listen, listen.
639260	640260	All right.
640260	641260	Here, here's the deal with part time.
641260	642260	Your managers don't like you.
642260	643260	You don't like your managers.
643260	644260	You're not friends.
644260	645880	You're not comrades in the struggle.
645880	650620	And this whole like, oh my God, the manager, the manager didn't come in on the weekend.
650620	651620	We had to do it.
651620	654220	You know what managers, you know, sometimes you get like shit bosses, right?
654220	658740	But a lot of the time managers are actually doing other jobs that are just as important.
658740	659740	You're just not seeing them.
659740	662180	It's like, oh, my manager is sitting in the office on the computer.
662340	663340	I can't fucking believe.
663340	664660	You know what he's doing on that computer?
664660	666780	He's ordering stock for the store.
666780	667780	Okay.
667780	671960	And so he spends a little while ordering stocks that you actually have, you know, donuts that
671960	674060	you can bake and coffee that you can pour.
674060	679620	A lot of these complaints about terrible managers, like 99 percent of them are just complete
679620	683140	in total ignorance about what other people in the workplace do.
683140	686100	They don't want to help us.
686100	688460	We need a union because this can't happen.
688460	689460	This can't happen.
689460	690460	We need fair scheduling.
691060	694140	What do you what do you fucking mean fair scheduling?
694140	696180	You're getting twenty five hours a week.
696180	697180	You're there.
697180	699140	They seem to be working around your classes.
699140	701260	You know, you're saying I'm a full time student.
701260	702260	They only schedule me on weekends.
702260	703540	Oh, when you don't have classes.
703540	704540	Okay.
704540	705540	You know what?
705540	706540	I was working part time.
706540	707540	I've worked many part time jobs.
707540	708940	I've been like, listen, I got other shit going on.
708940	710980	You can only schedule me on these days for these times.
710980	712140	If you can't fit me in.
712140	713140	All right.
713140	714140	I guess I get less hours than I should.
714140	718420	But no, I was firm with it because that's what you do when you're a fucking adult.
718420	719420	All right.
719420	720420	You remain firm.
721380	722380	Here's when I can work.
722380	723380	It's a part time job.
723380	724380	You're not my primary concern.
724380	726180	Either they let you go and you got to find another job, which is no big deal.
726180	728380	Part time jobs are, you know, easy come easy go.
728380	730900	Or they schedule you on your availability.
730900	732260	Welcome to being an adult.
732260	736740	We need managers to hold themselves accountable for helping their workers.
736740	738020	They refuse to turn mobile orders on.
738020	741460	We need the liberty to be able to do that because there's so many mobile orders and
741460	742820	I need to get through all of them.
742820	746540	And then people are yelling at me because I don't have their orders ready and they don't
746540	747540	know what to do.
747540	748540	I can't do it.
748540	749540	Oh, God.
749660	754980	There have been so many times where like retarded fucking customers have yelled and I've just
754980	756620	been like, all right, dude, whatever.
756620	758980	Like you, you got to get used to this.
758980	759980	All right.
759980	760980	Yeah, it sucks.
760980	761980	You probably shouldn't treat wages poorly.
761980	764060	You probably shouldn't treat wages poorly.
764060	765060	But welcome.
765060	766060	Welcome.
766060	767060	Welcome to how it is.
767060	772480	Listen, sometimes, sometimes an amateur filmmaker from Las Vegas in 1997 needs to go through
772480	776060	your drive through and abuse the wages there for his film.
776060	778460	Only SFO discord watchers will get it.
778460	781100	The customer was misgendering me today, like really badly.
781100	782380	I didn't have their order ready.
782380	787140	And so they were just like talking to each other and they're like, she's clearly incompetent.
787140	789620	I have a full mustache and beard.
789620	791700	Wait, you're trans?
791700	792700	Huh?
792700	797480	I mean, I guess that explains a lot of the instability, but no, I couldn't tell.
797480	798780	So well done on that.
798780	800180	You just seem like a soy boy.
800180	803660	I don't get accommodations for being neurodivergent.
803660	804660	I don't.
804660	805660	What?
805660	806660	What you fucking?
806940	813300	What fucking accommodations for neurodivergency like whatever the fuck are you autistic?
813300	814300	Like what is it?
814300	817260	Like, is there going to be like a special corner of the break room up there where it's
817260	819980	like it's all like padded walls or something like what the fuck do you want?
819980	822140	Do you want like a kitten petting area?
822140	824080	Like maybe you should go work at LinkedIn.
824080	825740	They seem to be really cushy over there.
825740	829260	I only got my wits out with this job.
829260	831260	I really am.
831260	832260	Here's what you do.
832260	833260	All right.
833260	834260	You're a man now.
834260	835260	So you got to act like a man.
835260	836260	All right.
836860	838580	You got to set boundaries and you got to stick to them.
838580	842100	And if it turns out that your workplace actually is really shit, well, then it means you got
842100	843100	to move on.
843100	847060	If it's not, then it means you have to quite literally grow a pair.
847060	850220	Now I'm not going to harp on this guy too much after this because because he really
850220	854820	did get raked over the fucking coals when this video went viral, like a ton of YouTubers
854820	857220	are reacting to this guy and making fun of him.
857220	859340	It was the perfect storm for rightoids on the Internet.
859340	865440	You know, trans Starbucks barista cries about really simplistic part time work.
865620	868400	I loved this shit when it happened and it definitely went too far.
868400	869400	That's for sure.
869400	872080	Like there's no reason for this to be featured on Fox News.
872080	876520	Fox News is not a rightoid YouTube channel that does react content and it seems like
876520	879920	the culture war has just rotted everyone's brain out.
879920	885600	And this is why the trans Starbucks barista is my personal pick for the lowest IQ Twitter
885600	890280	discourse of the year solely because it was a perfect storm of ridiculousness that went
890280	893120	way, way too fucking far.
893120	899240	You can tell a low IQ Twitter discourse specifically by noticing that if you actually analyze it
899240	904160	for more than, you know, five seconds and with more than five brain cells, you recognize
904160	909640	that they're all products of immense privilege, generally made by young leftist people who
909640	914180	are probably leftist, let's be real, because they're pretty young, who haven't really experienced
914180	918280	the world, who haven't really experienced any sort of oppression, haven't really worked
918280	919520	a day in their lives.
919520	924880	And the minute that their soft bodies, soft minds and soft lives experience even the slightest
924880	928720	little bit of resistance to anything that they want to do, it's oppression.
928720	933040	And so it turns into classism or ableism or whatever the fuck ism.
933040	936880	And if they're totally online, they make it into a low IQ Twitter discourse.
936880	938200	It is the best part of Twitter.
938200	940680	How stupid some of these fucking people can be.
940680	942760	I have tried many times to quit Twitter.
942760	947320	I probably never will simply because the laugh value is too great.
947360	950480	I can't wait for next year's low IQ Twitter discourses.
950480	951480	It's going to be incredible.
951480	952760	And I hope you guys are here for it.
952760	954680	I will see you then.
954680	955180	I love you.
