00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
Hello my friends, it's the end of the year and I've got a spare 30 minutes or so, so

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,040
I'm going to record this video off the cuff for you.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,300
Inspired by my friend Anna's Twitter post here.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,540
What was your favorite low IQ Twitter discourse this year?

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,020
This is the low IQ Twitter awards, guys.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,540
And there are a lot of good ones in here, like for example, Abolish Kitchens.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,540
I remember that stuff.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,540
I think he even replied.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,180
Mommy's wanting the communal kitchens of the Soviet Union back because owning your

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,180
own kitchen is a waste of resources and space and a sign of bourgeois decadence.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,500
Yeah, that was a thing.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,780
I recall someone saying, no one needs a kitchen.

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,900
In fact, no one needs an ex seems to be a common logic with the communists online.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,860
They did the same thing when the Stadia shut down and I was talking about that back in

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,860
that video.

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,580
There was that one idiot who was like, no one needs a console.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,780
It's more sustainable if we all just run things from Google servers.

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,300
It's like, shut the fuck up.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,900
This person, of course, says the same as every year, can't get pride.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,180
That is an especially cancerous discourse.

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,180
That's for sure.

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
EBT fast food.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,180
I don't remember that one.

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,100
I'm considering the name of it.

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,660
Maybe I'm happy that it didn't happen.

26
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,420
NFTs are transphrenology in sports.

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,420
Oh God.

28
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,720
Oh yeah.

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,140
The whole restaurants are exploitative thing.

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,860
Like the idea of restaurants and after the revolution, everyone will cook their own food.

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
You can do that now.

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,700
And actually I've seen the inverse too.

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,820
I've seen the inverse where people were saying like, after the revolution, you will simply

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,780
order food from a centralized source.

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,780
Oh yeah.

36
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,240
The anarchist supply chains.

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,100
This was like when doe and demon mama were fighting over because they're both like, and

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,000
comms, you know, anarcho communists.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,220
They wanted to like destroy supply chains and prevent goods from being moved around.

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,380
And it's like, how, how do you, how, how do you expect to redistribute if you have no

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,100
supply chains, you fucking morons, those kids don't look those people up, by the way, they're

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,340
literally the dumbest people on the internet.

43
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,500
It's not fucking worth it.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,540
Here's one that I remember.

45
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,980
This is from grumpy shrubbery and my God, this makes my brain leak out of my ears.

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,120
Unfriendly reminder.

47
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,780
If you claim to advocate on behalf of the mentally ill and or neurodivergent, but exclude

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,060
people with personality disorders, particularly narcissistic personality disorder from your

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,340
activism, you're an activist.

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
You're an ableist.

51
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,300
You don't get to pick and choose with which disabilities are worth your time.

52
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,140
You don't have to understand someone's brain to know that ableism is bad.

53
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
That's the whole fucking point.

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,300
So let me get this straight, if you don't let that narcissist steal everything from

55
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,740
you and then rape your fucking beheaded corpse, you're a, you're being an ableist.

56
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,060
Well sign me up for bigot school, baby.

57
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,740
This person, by the way, grumpy shrubbery, this person's insane.

58
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,100
They regularly have the most terminally online brain rotted takes I've ever seen.

59
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,240
For example, this is their most viral tweet of the year.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,780
It really doesn't sit right with me when people make fun of people who can't cook.

61
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,780
It's not their fault that no one taught them.

62
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,520
And learning any skill as an adult can be really daunting, especially when cookery is

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,680
such an overwhelmingly broad concept, ha ha.

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,580
They can't even boil an egg.

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,720
That's not funny.

66
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
It's shit.

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
They never had an opportunity to learn.

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,180
Instead of just providing that opportunity, you're just going to laugh at them.

69
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,580
OMG, get a life.

70
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,100
Having opportunities to learn to cook as a kid is a massive privilege.

71
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,740
Yes, this is the infamous boiling an egg is classist discourse.

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,120
The recipe starts by telling you to boil an egg.

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,660
You Google how to boil an egg.

74
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,420
It tells you to boil a pot of water.

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
How much water?

76
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
Which pot?

77
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
What temperature?

78
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,020
You give up and order a pizza.

79
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,540
Hey, I feel personally called out here.

80
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,660
Everyone's missing the point.

81
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,540
What you see as obvious is not obvious.

82
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,820
I've never taught them.

83
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
This is an example.

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,860
I know how to boil water, but also set the stove down to the highest temperature isn't

85
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,060
some intuitive thing a person knows.

86
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,260
It's not an instinct.

87
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,420
These people, they seem like they seem like they're like actually retarded.

88
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,940
Like they're actually remedial.

89
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,840
They have to go to the special classroom in school because they can't do the most basic

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
fucking things.

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Okay.

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Here's the thing about boiling an egg.

93
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
All right.

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,180
Assume that you had to boil an egg and assume that all you could do is trial and error.

95
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,940
You have your dozen eggs, you have your water, you have your pot.

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,340
Maybe you put the egg, the egg into the pot and then you don't add the water and then

97
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,060
it burns the egg and then your smoke alarm goes off.

98
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Okay.

99
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
There's attempt one.

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,060
Don't do that.

101
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,420
Maybe you put water and maybe you boil it too much and the egg gets way too hot and

102
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,420
explodes.

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,900
That happens sometimes, especially when you take it out of the water.

104
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Okay.

105
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
You boil it too much.

106
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,100
And you're learning, you know, the third one, you cook it up.

107
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,300
Maybe you, uh, you cook it too little and then it's kind of raw on the inside.

108
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
All right.

109
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,980
You know, people learn it's trial and error.

110
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,860
You don't need to be taught by someone.

111
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,080
You should have the mental faculty to just give something a go and see what sticks, which

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,600
is what makes a lot of these conversations.

113
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,040
So like absolutely fucking ridiculous.

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,540
You know, just the idea that you should have to have the minimum amount of standards and

115
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,840
just, Hey, maybe, you know, you're an adult now.

116
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,320
You're not this, you know, 15 year old, quirky neurodivergent activist teen.

117
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
You're in your twenties.

118
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,920
Now you gotta be taking care of yourself.

119
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
You gotta do your own laundry.

120
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,360
You gotta make your own food.

121
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,540
Welcome to being a person.

122
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,720
How about you try a few things and figure it the fuck out.

123
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
All right.

124
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,180
At some point it stops being classist.

125
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,140
It stops being ableist and it just becomes regular fucking human living that apparently

126
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
you can't do.

127
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
It's kind of feels like that.

128
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,160
They them household meme video that I did like six months ago.

129
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,900
I would not want a fucking room with any of these people.

130
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,260
These are the same individuals who blame capitalism or the bourgeois or their landlords

131
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,500
or their parents that they can't hold down jobs or afford mortgages.

132
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,780
If you can't boil an egg, you can't own a fucking house.

133
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,460
And Anna's not the only person doing this sort of thing.

134
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,380
You've got, what was the most chronically online discourse you saw this year?

135
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,340
Mine's gotta be chopping tomatoes as elitist.

136
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
Oh my God.

137
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,420
Do I really want to dive down more than one of these threads?

138
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,260
Sometimes every once in a blue moon, I think you guys ask too much of me.

139
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,060
I unironically hate this like infantilization of adults, but like it's not even infantilization

140
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,940
by some kind of overarching authority.

141
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,180
They infantilize themselves.

142
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:01,100
They, they make themselves look as like as weak and impotent as they possibly can.

143
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,260
Like, look at this, look at this guy.

144
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Hello Seattle.

145
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,500
I haven't left my apartment in over two years due to crippling anxiety and my work from

146
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
home job.

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,980
Today I finally went out and got an adult happy meal.

148
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,980
Dude.

149
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,080
God, I don't know how, how mean I want to be because there's like the, on the one hand

150
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,980
okay, crippling anxiety.

151
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,320
Good job for actually like taking a step outside and you're doing it, but how in the fuck did

152
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,680
you let it get this bad?

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
And the worst part is that when older people like Gen X or whatever, they noticed that

154
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,040
this is like the hip new thing with the kids.

155
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,960
And so they purposely do the infantilizing thing as a way to relate.

156
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,480
And it's like, Oh, here, watch this and cringe with me.

157
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,360
It's Monday night and here's what's happened.

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,520
V, what are you, what are you doing under my desk?

159
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,040
Well under the desk is kind of my thing.

160
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,980
I mean, but here's the thing.

161
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,460
You can stay for now, but when it comes time to voting, you're going to have to get up

162
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,980
because you've got climate change legislation on the ballot.

163
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,340
You've got gun safety and if we can elect more pro-choice members of Congress, we can

164
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,100
re-institute Roe versus Wade as the law of the land.

165
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,900
So you can't stay here.

166
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,260
You're going to have to take a little bit of time to vote now about time to say that

167
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,300
I voted for McCain in 2008, as long as you voted, this is how the Democrats will keep

168
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
winning elections.

169
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Guys.

170
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,900
There's a lot of talkers hiding under tables from the world and Obama coming and sitting

171
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,920
down and being like, it's all right, buddy.

172
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,860
This seems like mentally handicapped advertising for a mentally handicapped generation.

173
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,020
This entire infantilizing sentiment culminated with this video that went viral while I was

174
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,700
off busy being a corpse.

175
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,380
I'm sure you've seen literally everyone else's take on this, so I won't spend too long on

176
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,180
it, but let's at least take a quick view.

177
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,060
People wonder why we need a union at Starbucks and oh my, oh my God, I have to stop right

178
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
now.

179
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,380
We're five seconds into the video and I'm already stopping.

180
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,740
Unions have their place, right?

181
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,940
But man, every single one of my experiences with a union has been negative.

182
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,100
And no, you don't need a union at a fast food place.

183
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,320
Like this is not supposed to be a career.

184
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,300
This is a revolving door job.

185
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,440
Use it as a stepping stone, make some quick cash, get the fuck out.

186
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,380
If you're sitting here thinking this is where you're going to be in 10, 20 years, dude,

187
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,660
you got to be shooting higher than this.

188
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,100
I am literally about to quit.

189
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,460
Like I, I don't know if I'm going to do it, but like, I really want to, I almost walked

190
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,180
out today and I'm...

191
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Do it pussy.

192
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
Do it.

193
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,340
I'm crying in the bathroom right now and I almost cried on the floor.

194
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,780
It's just, I like, it gets, I'm like a full-time student.

195
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,200
Oh my God, dude, you're, you're a full-time student and you're doing this part-time job

196
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,820
when you got to go into the break room and like cuddle up and cry.

197
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
Really?

198
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:44,740
Welcome to a job, dude.

199
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,020
Like what the...

200
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm scheduled part-time, 25 hours a week.

201
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,980
Yeah, it's part-time dude.

202
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,580
On the weekends they got me opening clothes.

203
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,860
They got me doing an eight hour shift.

204
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,260
Yeah, that's an being an adult.

205
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,340
Welcome to regular work.

206
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,980
Regular works, 40 hours a week, nine to five, baby.

207
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,580
Both Saturday and Sunday, I'm like three and a half hours into my shift.

208
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,380
There's so many customers and we have four people on the floor all day.

209
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,140
Oh, oh, you poor, you poor child.

210
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,620
There's work to do at work and I can't handle it.

211
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,100
Only five people were put on the schedule and somebody had to call out and there were

212
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,020
four people running the whole store and there's so many customers and there's possibly scheduled

213
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,420
five people.

214
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,420
Yeah.

215
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,980
Welcome, welcome to the lunch rush at Starbucks.

216
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,540
People are coming in, they want their coffees, they want, I mean, I think it makes sense.

217
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,820
They want their sandwiches or donuts or whatever the fucking Starbucks, you know, most, most

218
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
coffee places do that.

219
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
You know, people want their food.

220
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,980
This is what you're paid for.

221
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,100
You're paid, I can't believe I have to explain this, you're paid to get the coffee and get

222
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,220
the sandwich and get the donut and then give it to the people who have paid you money for

223
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
it.

224
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
All right.

225
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Like this is your job.

226
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,980
You're not describing anything that is out of the ordinary.

227
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,380
This is something you should be used to by now that, oh my God, there's people and they

228
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,860
want, they want their food.

229
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,700
Oh, this is terrible.

230
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,140
Karl Marx, save us.

231
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:10,020
We only have 13 people employed at this store and there's so many customers.

232
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:18,460
The customers, they're coming like zombies, donuts, coffee, we don't have fair scheduling.

233
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
Managers don't care about us.

234
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,900
Our manager was supposed to come in this weekend and he took himself off the schedule so he

235
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,020
wouldn't be able to be held accountable for calling out.

236
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,600
He just literally tore down the schedule that he was scheduled on and put up a new schedule

237
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
where he wasn't on the schedule.

238
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,020
Also, he couldn't have even seen that he was scheduled in the first place because he didn't

239
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,260
want to be held accountable for not wanting to come in.

240
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Okay.

241
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
Good shot.

242
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Okay.

243
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Listen, listen.

244
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
All right.

245
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
Here, here's the deal with part time.

246
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Your managers don't like you.

247
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
You don't like your managers.

248
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
You're not friends.

249
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,880
You're not comrades in the struggle.

250
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,620
And this whole like, oh my God, the manager, the manager didn't come in on the weekend.

251
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
We had to do it.

252
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,220
You know what managers, you know, sometimes you get like shit bosses, right?

253
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,740
But a lot of the time managers are actually doing other jobs that are just as important.

254
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
You're just not seeing them.

255
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,180
It's like, oh, my manager is sitting in the office on the computer.

256
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
I can't fucking believe.

257
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,660
You know what he's doing on that computer?

258
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,780
He's ordering stock for the store.

259
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Okay.

260
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,960
And so he spends a little while ordering stocks that you actually have, you know, donuts that

261
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,060
you can bake and coffee that you can pour.

262
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,620
A lot of these complaints about terrible managers, like 99 percent of them are just complete

263
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,140
in total ignorance about what other people in the workplace do.

264
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,100
They don't want to help us.

265
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,460
We need a union because this can't happen.

266
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
This can't happen.

267
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
We need fair scheduling.

268
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,140
What do you what do you fucking mean fair scheduling?

269
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,180
You're getting twenty five hours a week.

270
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,180
You're there.

271
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,140
They seem to be working around your classes.

272
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,260
You know, you're saying I'm a full time student.

273
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
They only schedule me on weekends.

274
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,540
Oh, when you don't have classes.

275
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,540
Okay.

276
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
You know what?

277
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
I was working part time.

278
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
I've worked many part time jobs.

279
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,940
I've been like, listen, I got other shit going on.

280
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,980
You can only schedule me on these days for these times.

281
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,140
If you can't fit me in.

282
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
All right.

283
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
I guess I get less hours than I should.

284
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,420
But no, I was firm with it because that's what you do when you're a fucking adult.

285
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,420
All right.

286
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
You remain firm.

287
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,380
Here's when I can work.

288
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
It's a part time job.

289
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
You're not my primary concern.

290
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,180
Either they let you go and you got to find another job, which is no big deal.

291
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,380
Part time jobs are, you know, easy come easy go.

292
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,900
Or they schedule you on your availability.

293
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,260
Welcome to being an adult.

294
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,740
We need managers to hold themselves accountable for helping their workers.

295
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,020
They refuse to turn mobile orders on.

296
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,460
We need the liberty to be able to do that because there's so many mobile orders and

297
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,820
I need to get through all of them.

298
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,540
And then people are yelling at me because I don't have their orders ready and they don't

299
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
know what to do.

300
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
I can't do it.

301
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
Oh, God.

302
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,980
There have been so many times where like retarded fucking customers have yelled and I've just

303
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,620
been like, all right, dude, whatever.

304
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,980
Like you, you got to get used to this.

305
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,980
All right.

306
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Yeah, it sucks.

307
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
You probably shouldn't treat wages poorly.

308
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,060
You probably shouldn't treat wages poorly.

309
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
But welcome.

310
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,060
Welcome.

311
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Welcome to how it is.

312
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,480
Listen, sometimes, sometimes an amateur filmmaker from Las Vegas in 1997 needs to go through

313
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,060
your drive through and abuse the wages there for his film.

314
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,460
Only SFO discord watchers will get it.

315
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,100
The customer was misgendering me today, like really badly.

316
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,380
I didn't have their order ready.

317
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,140
And so they were just like talking to each other and they're like, she's clearly incompetent.

318
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,620
I have a full mustache and beard.

319
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,700
Wait, you're trans?

320
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Huh?

321
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,480
I mean, I guess that explains a lot of the instability, but no, I couldn't tell.

322
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,780
So well done on that.

323
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,180
You just seem like a soy boy.

324
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,660
I don't get accommodations for being neurodivergent.

325
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
I don't.

326
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,660
What?

327
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
What you fucking?

328
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,300
What fucking accommodations for neurodivergency like whatever the fuck are you autistic?

329
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Like what is it?

330
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,260
Like, is there going to be like a special corner of the break room up there where it's

331
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,980
like it's all like padded walls or something like what the fuck do you want?

332
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,140
Do you want like a kitten petting area?

333
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,080
Like maybe you should go work at LinkedIn.

334
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,740
They seem to be really cushy over there.

335
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,260
I only got my wits out with this job.

336
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
I really am.

337
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Here's what you do.

338
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
All right.

339
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
You're a man now.

340
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
So you got to act like a man.

341
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
All right.

342
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,580
You got to set boundaries and you got to stick to them.

343
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,100
And if it turns out that your workplace actually is really shit, well, then it means you got

344
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
to move on.

345
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,060
If it's not, then it means you have to quite literally grow a pair.

346
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,220
Now I'm not going to harp on this guy too much after this because because he really

347
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,820
did get raked over the fucking coals when this video went viral, like a ton of YouTubers

348
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,220
are reacting to this guy and making fun of him.

349
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,340
It was the perfect storm for rightoids on the Internet.

350
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,440
You know, trans Starbucks barista cries about really simplistic part time work.

351
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,400
I loved this shit when it happened and it definitely went too far.

352
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
That's for sure.

353
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,080
Like there's no reason for this to be featured on Fox News.

354
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,520
Fox News is not a rightoid YouTube channel that does react content and it seems like

355
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,920
the culture war has just rotted everyone's brain out.

356
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,600
And this is why the trans Starbucks barista is my personal pick for the lowest IQ Twitter

357
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,280
discourse of the year solely because it was a perfect storm of ridiculousness that went

358
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,120
way, way too fucking far.

359
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,240
You can tell a low IQ Twitter discourse specifically by noticing that if you actually analyze it

360
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,160
for more than, you know, five seconds and with more than five brain cells, you recognize

361
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,640
that they're all products of immense privilege, generally made by young leftist people who

362
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,180
are probably leftist, let's be real, because they're pretty young, who haven't really experienced

363
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,280
the world, who haven't really experienced any sort of oppression, haven't really worked

364
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,520
a day in their lives.

365
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,880
And the minute that their soft bodies, soft minds and soft lives experience even the slightest

366
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
little bit of resistance to anything that they want to do, it's oppression.

367
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,040
And so it turns into classism or ableism or whatever the fuck ism.

368
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
And if they're totally online, they make it into a low IQ Twitter discourse.

369
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,200
It is the best part of Twitter.

370
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,680
How stupid some of these fucking people can be.

371
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,760
I have tried many times to quit Twitter.

372
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,320
I probably never will simply because the laugh value is too great.

373
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
I can't wait for next year's low IQ Twitter discourses.

374
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
It's going to be incredible.

375
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,760
And I hope you guys are here for it.

376
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
I will see you then.

377
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,180
I love you.
