1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Music

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,480
In my video about Team Squirrel, I told you that this information is important, so let's get to the second story.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,800
First, when I told you that Team Squirrel was the public force because of the platform,

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,000
and immediately because they were involucred, and that Paypal and Stripe were going to make a Subscribestar,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,600
I didn't include the capture of those pants.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,200
So, let's look at some of these.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,840
Look at this picture of this.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,280
Well, when I told you that Team Squirrel was the public force because of the platform,

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,840
one of the people I invited to regularize their work,

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,720
was sexually abused by various members of the committee.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,440
Team Squirrel had this three years ago,

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,760
only because the information was filtered by other people.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,480
This was due to the lack of respect for the use of the platform.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,680
During my time as the president of Team Squirrel,

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,160
I was also the director of the network.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,160
A few years ago, I was on Twitter and frequently invited to talk to members of the committee.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,640
Informally, I told them that I would not be able to invite them.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,440
I was not sure that it would be encrypted by a member of the committee,

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,920
and that the members of the committee would be involved in the situation.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,160
Finally, the Subscribestar was sent.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,560
I was able to talk to these people,

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,800
and they could help me to ensure that this person was completely exiled from the Cambridge Center.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,480
I was not exonerated, and they were fired.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,040
I was scared that other people would be replaced.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,000
And that was all possible, because of the use of the platform.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,680
When I was young, I was scared that other people would not be able to have access to the status.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,240
I could not name the person in question because of the use of the platform.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,600
It was a problem that regularly existed in academic work.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,480
I used to be able to do it.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,200
I had no idea.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,760
I could not do other things that would have helped me to make a future.

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,600
I was going to do it, but I was going to do it better.

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,480
How many people would say that when Milo and I would not be able to explain to them what had happened in Hollywood,

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,800
despite the lack of information about the members of the committee.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,520
Some people attacked one of the subjects, which was Welton,

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,560
because he was my brother, and presented the same thing to me.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,920
You know, I lived in Hollywood a while ago.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,360
Did you? Did you go to one of his parties?

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,160
I went to other people who I won't name, of a similar stature in Hollywood.

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,680
I went to their boat parties and to their house parties and things, and some of the things I have seen have beggared belief.

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,320
Yeah? Can you give us like a...

42
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,200
Well, just, I can't, I don't want to be indiscreet about specific people.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,040
Right, you don't have to do that. Just dance around the facts.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Yeah, dangerous, but I can tell you the truth without dropping anyone in it.

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,080
I mean, some of the boys there were very young.

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,680
Very young.

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,800
And this is really recently?

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,400
I don't remember, no, no, like, I don't know, eight years ago.

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,480
I don't remember...

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
Stactional limitations.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,640
I don't remember whether I ever met Brian Singer or whether I even knew who he was then.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,480
But I knew other people of similar stature, as I say, and there were some very young boys around at that time.

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,320
There was a lot of drugs, and a lot of...

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,280
Twinks.

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,400
A lot of twinks, taking drugs and having unsafe sex with older men, and some of these boys were very young.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,880
But the most fascinating result is when people of my age want to progress,

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,720
and they are left with a lot of bad things.

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,400
And they have to ask if they are going to sacrifice themselves in the number of poor people,

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,600
or if they are going to be burdened by the virus,

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,800
because they are simply too important for the cause.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,320
For those of you who are watching this last group, of those who are sleeping giants,

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm sure you've seen it in a video on that.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,520
But well, it's not sufficient, this is Rodolfo Rancida.

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,480
The Patreon page is still constant in my last video.

65
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,800
I wanted to share some important points between more and more people.

66
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,720
Many creators, like me, went to the platform where they were able to buy their own terms of service,

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,840
and the word of the company's name, to try to find a good way to do it.

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,480
But it seems that Patreon has entered a bit of a panic.

69
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,560
In the department, I'm sure of my confidence.

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,720
In the case of Jacqueline Hart, one of my stories has extended my view of the socialistic republic of Patreon,

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,800
and I think it's not only about you, it's about Matt Christensen.

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,680
One of my recapitulations.

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,320
Jacqueline Hart wanted to be a cooperative family.

74
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,280
She has experience in taxes and finances,

75
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
but she wanted to be a part of her time in conferences about women,

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,160
about diversity, and things like that.

77
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,120
The main thing is the audience.

78
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,560
One of them is Luana Vandonado,

79
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,360
from Patreon's Patreon page,

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,640
who told me directly about the topic and told me about all the information needed.

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,240
Our experience with each creator is individual,

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,960
and I'd like to talk about what I can do to help our audience.

83
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,320
More specifically, I'd like to thank the audience for their experience with Patreon and their support,

84
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,880
and what they've done in the work that they do.

85
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,080
Now, remember this message that I didn't do for Nade.

86
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,600
This Patreon is trying to secure their own stories,

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,960
and the description of it is for an exclusive discussion about the rules and the causes of one of them.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,400
And I'm sure you'll be able to tell me that the idea of what depends is secure with you.

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
You can share it with others.

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,240
Well, this message that I gave on the phone at the end of December

91
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,480
between Matt Christiansen and Jacqueline Hart.

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,240
I'm going to leave the description on the table.

93
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,560
And if you want to see the video I'm going to share with you,

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,400
I'm going to share it with you.

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,920
It's very good news for the people of Mujar,

96
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,280
but I'd like to introduce what I believe are two integral points.

97
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,320
Matt and Jacqueline are good news in a principle

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,920
for the expression of expression,

99
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,320
and because people are going under the platform.

100
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,640
The one I'm going to tell you about is Jacqueline.

101
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
The problem is that Patreon is so bad,

102
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,840
and I believe that we can get to the first point

103
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,160
and there are other things that we need to consider.

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,920
First, our financial transition to the graduation class.

105
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,320
To be able to complete our transition,

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,520
we have created a community of graders

107
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,240
who are so much like us in the platform.

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,120
If we wanted to make some expressions,

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,040
which are some expressions of expression,

110
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,400
then it's only the graders that use Patreon

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,840
that don't have any problems with these decorative forms,

112
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,040
they are the ones who use the platform,

113
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,640
and our transition is very bad.

114
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,360
But, besides, as a platformer in Brazil,

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,480
processing pages is one of our nuclear values.

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,240
And we depend on the processing of pages

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,480
that have the appropriate rules

118
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,440
on what you are going to be processing, and what not.

119
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,960
Matt, I was thinking that this Patreon decision

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,280
would be something that the president wouldn't do.

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Jacqueline, no.

122
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,760
This was entirely a decision by Patreon.

123
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,000
Matt, well, I'm not sure why you're passing the card

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
over there, Matt.

125
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,360
Jacqueline, no, I'm not passing the card over there.

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,600
We have some linear terms.

127
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
I'm trying to explain that, number one,

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,120
our transition is financed by the graders,

129
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,080
and that, obviously, some people don't want to be associated.

130
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,560
Matt, well, if it's a mission,

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,000
then the processing of pages is irrelevant.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
It's a mission.

133
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,920
That's what I'm talking about.

134
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,520
Jacqueline, we're not using the card.

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,320
We don't have the rules.

136
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
That's what I'm saying.

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,640
There's a track on all of this.

138
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,120
There's also a contradiction.

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,280
For the fact that the decision to share the card

140
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
with you is completely a Patreon,

141
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
but by the way,

142
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,880
there are no visas and Mastercards,

143
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,920
and they are not what are the rules.

144
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,880
So we have three possibilities.

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,320
One, this Patreon decision

146
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,280
always has extreme forces,

147
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,520
with which a boycott of the social areas is justified.

148
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,720
Two, visa and Mastercard are forcing a Patreon on this,

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
and it's a bit of both

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,880
that companies have an interest in Sargon.

151
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,920
Or three, that a company has an ideological line,

152
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,160
and that it's a thing.

153
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,800
There's a demand for a ride,

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,600
and with what Patreon is doing internally,

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,760
I think it's a big problem.

156
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,160
We have a second point

157
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,680
that I want to share with the three Christians in my heart,

158
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,000
the inerrant success that Patreon has adopted

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,920
as part of their solutions.

160
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,960
Jacqueline, the second one is that we have a reason

161
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,680
that we are observing all of your work and determining

162
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,120
if this is something that is multiplexed.

163
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,640
We have to see these things as your work,

164
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,520
and as good as possible.

165
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,400
Matt, are you saying that you are an individual?

166
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Jacqueline?

167
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,600
Yes.

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,760
Matt, how is it possible that you are a standard?

169
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,720
Don't you want to be a platform for everything?

170
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Jacqueline, this is a very good question.

171
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,640
And yes, I would like to see a platform for everything,

172
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,200
but as you can imagine,

173
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,640
it's very difficult to do it manually.

174
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,360
And it's very clear that we want to see this direction,

175
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
because I think it's a human element.

176
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,400
Today, we have humans that resonate with us

177
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,120
and contact us with creators,

178
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,160
and for that reason, they resonate with us.

179
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,720
But we want this to be a platform

180
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,000
that can be used as a platform for three private products.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,400
We want these to be analytic.

182
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,880
Matt, are you saying that you are an individual?

183
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,600
Jacqueline?

184
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,480
Yes.

185
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,760
I understand.

186
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,040
Matt?

187
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Okay.

188
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,840
I understand that you are someone who is creators like me,

189
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,640
and to all the people who are confused about your platform,

190
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
Jacqueline.

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
What we are trying to do is to have the most possible tools

192
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,720
to be able to be transparent

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,800
and consider all the points of view.

194
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,880
We want to ensure that we are not operating on a camera.

195
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,120
We don't want to have a process

196
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,200
where we consider different opinions

197
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,280
when we are creators.

198
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,440
This is my point about this,

199
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,120
but I am partially concerned with Jacqueline's report.

200
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,760
We want the concept of the spirit of the letter of the law.

201
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,200
The exception to the law,

202
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,240
but one of the exceptions exists,

203
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,880
and many of these can be necessary

204
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,800
that the law and the laws are in crisis,

205
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,000
so we can live with extraordinary circumstances

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,800
that were not thought about.

207
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
From this point of view,

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
not only do you understand and know that it is preferable

209
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,360
that the law is used by human beings.

210
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,600
For example, the biggest problem with YouTube

211
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,400
is that it is essentially this subjective choice.

212
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Since the copyright laws are proposed for both,

213
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,640
they don't have any context or use for them.

214
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,120
Although I don't think I have any experience in this area,

215
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,400
but I find that people who want to do things,

216
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,840
subjective and just,

217
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,240
are one of the biggest problems in the system.

218
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,480
There are people from all over the world,

219
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,880
and they are looking at everything, case by case.

220
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,560
If you look at this from a dialogical perspective,

221
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,000
you can completely understand the context

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
of the law and the law,

223
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
so the things that exist are good.

224
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
But that is not what they are saying.

225
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,280
I think it is subjective that they want to try something

226
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,840
that is much more tyrannical

227
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,760
than an automatically automated option.

228
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,800
And the comments from Jacqueline from my channel,

229
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,560
that the subjective system of Patreon

230
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
doesn't only try to try something in any form,

231
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,960
if not from each,

232
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
if it's an ideology.

233
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
Jacqueline.

234
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,920
Otherwise, this is the case by case.

235
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,080
Every creator has the opportunity to talk.

236
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,280
I want this to be completely clear.

237
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,240
Every time we talk about Algen,

238
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,680
this person has the opportunity to talk.

239
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,680
That was true when I was a child, for example,

240
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,880
but the time with the public opinion,

241
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,400
which expressed respect for the group

242
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,720
with which they were associated

243
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,480
and which we cancelled out,

244
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,440
had to come from the creator's side.

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,800
So, if you see what I'm saying,

246
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,680
I think there are a lot of people

247
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,760
who don't believe that this is going to happen.

248
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,240
Matt.

249
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,720
Okay, so it's a very subjective choice

250
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,960
if the reputability was sufficiently good.

251
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Jacqueline.

252
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,000
Basically, you can shoot different groups on Patreon,

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,760
but if a creator is there

254
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,800
or actively opposed to these groups,

255
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
then it's not going to be permitted on the platform.

256
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
Matt.

257
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm going to go, and I'm going to go.

258
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Decho has his photography on me.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,920
This is a form of a person who is pro-crypto

260
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,240
who can pro-crypto me for his association.

261
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,280
I'm going to go now, I'm going to go.

262
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,000
I think I'm going to go.

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
Jacqueline.

264
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,440
No, for some reason I can't.

265
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,480
The time is when my respect for the group

266
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,400
doesn't have anything to do with this.

267
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,920
But the time is not with the group

268
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,760
that they are associated with.

269
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,720
It's more about the group that they are associated with.

270
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,760
Matt.

271
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,640
Well, I'm going to go,

272
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,200
and I'm going to go on Patreon.

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,080
Why don't you do a similar session?

274
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,360
Jacqueline.

275
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
To the group, it's not the same

276
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,080
that I'm talking about on the other side.

277
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,160
Matt.

278
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,400
What is it that made you want to be on the other side

279
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,640
of this network?

280
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,560
Jacqueline.

281
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,520
I don't want to talk about specific things.

282
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,200
Really, Matt.

283
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,360
Why don't you send me a mail

284
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,880
that references a specific case?

285
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,520
The network is called Charla.

286
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,240
It's the one that I wrote.

287
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,080
In the New York Times article,

288
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,760
Patreon excluded anti-feminists for racist discourse,

289
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,240
indicating a result.

290
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,200
It is possible that,

291
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,960
given the political views of Patreon,

292
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,040
the company has been contacted

293
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440
with the interview and the question,

294
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,080
and they have made specific plans.

295
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,240
They have included in the world the material

296
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
that has led to politics

297
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,400
and has made a public discourse.

298
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,280
I would like to say that

299
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,440
we have been in the hands of the creators

300
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,400
and we have worked with them

301
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,360
in a way of one to one.

302
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,520
And yet, all the creators are reformers.

303
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,000
So, it's a very exciting process.

304
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,480
Sargon has not responded to the platform of Patreon.

305
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,520
Patreon has not seen its creators as clients.

306
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,680
They seem like children who are vigilant

307
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,800
and, when they cross the line,

308
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,240
uneducated.

309
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Or, in their own words,

310
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
they are made of the man.

311
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Even human beings with the same respect

312
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,560
participate involuntarily in the process of reform,

313
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,200
with the question of principles.

314
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
Patreon is a company of tyranos,

315
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
where the most important thing is to reduce,

316
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
especially in the news,

317
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,800
to admit that you are a victim

318
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,320
and to ask for your pardon.

319
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,160
That is not to create a negative relationship,

320
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,280
to create a relationship between your guests.

321
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,200
During all times,

322
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,760
it is the principle of the sake of Patreon's support,

323
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,640
but it is also that the heart is at the center of everything.

324
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,760
In the next episode, we are going to talk about what this is all about.

325
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,160
First, let's see how the time has passed,

326
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,680
because if you are a young person

327
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,760
at this event,

328
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,880
and you want to know what happens the next time,

329
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,280
we will see Jacqueline's career in LinkedIn,

330
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,920
the one that she has been working on.

331
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,240
My question would be,

332
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,240
what is the most that she is trying to solve?

333
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,680
And here is a time limit for you to consider.

334
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,960
The 30th of October 2008,

335
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
Patreon has been an event

336
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,560
based on the recent administration for workers.

337
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,360
Jacqueline has been at this conference

338
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
for a long time,

339
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,200
and during that time,

340
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,160
she has been working on the recent administration

341
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,200
of her colleagues at PayPal.

342
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,760
The 30th of April in Patreon

343
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,880
is much more than ideal.

344
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,600
The present of PayPal,

345
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
David Marcus,

346
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,240
has invited Patreon to show their support.

347
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,640
Another significant member of Patreon

348
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,200
is Thrive Capital,

349
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,080
which is also an important member of Thrive.

350
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,400
And, as a part of the group,

351
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,720
Joshua Kushner,

352
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,440
Raman of Jared Kushner,

353
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,040
Nueva de Nueva del Tramp,

354
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,720
is also the founder of Thrive Capital.

355
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
Despite the great separation of Tramp,

356
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,920
I have no idea what the Emperor told us

357
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,480
when he pushed us to do it.

358
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,640
It's a bargain.

359
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,280
The final result of Sleeping Giants

360
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,560
has also been attacked by Thrive

361
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,600
two months ago,

362
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,880
during the attack in Aqaba.

363
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,400
I don't know about the attention,

364
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,960
but Thrive has been so happy

365
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,400
to be able to support the subscription service

366
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
that Team Squirrel

367
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
has also invited a potential

368
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,840
for Sleeping Giants.

369
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,160
We are extremely happy when Thrive

370
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,000
has been able to,

371
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:53,000
be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be

373
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,160
to remove Sargon's financing.

374
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,840
It's possible that the Twitch account doesn't benefit from that.

375
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,960
But Team Squirrel and platform hate

376
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,760
don't know how to deal with connections as important as Senna's,

377
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,520
the one that makes things happen.

378
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,760
And you have to remember Jacqueline's admission

379
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,680
that Patreon doesn't monitor her service,

380
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,360
and that she has to report to her users.

381
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,800
The Twitch account can do everything it needs to do for Senna's team.

382
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,440
And in that moment,

383
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,080
all that Patreon needs is one that can be used against her.

384
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,920
And of course, Chazaben,

385
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,480
who wants to go there

386
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,320
to be able to make a reason.

387
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,200
All that's needed is an excuse to use it.

388
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,320
It's not a definitive pro,

389
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,520
but for me, at least, it's how it is.

390
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,520
If this is the project that Patreon is using as a game market,

391
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,000
it's going to be new.

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,040
The game market music is too.

393
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,800
Where the monumental market of a very corrupt game

394
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
exposes the corruption of the industry

395
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
and tracks different people

396
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,160
against different threats,

397
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,400
controlling narratives,

398
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,280
and removing people from incorrect politics.

399
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,760
I think this is a very pertinent description,

400
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,360
because, as I said earlier,

401
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,760
the part of our new queen and the team that we have,

402
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,120
at the end of the game, is much more evident.

403
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,520
And that's why Patreon can be a very big part of it.

404
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,000
Jacqueline said that the decision to remove her service with Patreon

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,160
is not a visa, it's a mattercard.

406
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,880
It can't simply be a real one.

407
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,120
The mattercard is used to do things like this.

408
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,480
David Horowitz said that his Freedom Foundation

409
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,680
should remove the services of visa and mattercard

410
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
from the SSPL.

411
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,520
He declared that it was only a group of people.

412
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,960
A visa that could communicate that it was not an involuntary one.

413
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,280
SubscribeStar was invited by all the paid processors.

414
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
PayPal was a pioneer, Stripe,

415
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,440
including Ambas, Visa, and Mattercard.

416
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,800
In the meantime, Mastercard recorded all the services in the 2010s.

417
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,760
Here are the questions.

418
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,960
The companies that are trying to convert in the new decade

419
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,560
are going to do this, and they're not going to select what is good and what is bad.

420
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,960
In the 2000s, at WikiLeaks, Visa and Mattercard also created their services,

421
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,760
similar to Megablot.

422
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,480
And, as I said, WikiLeaks was already being invented,

423
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,000
Mattercard was used to remove the services.

424
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,920
In the past, it was the point of expanding governmental corruption.

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,420
The

426
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,680
package that they had was removed from Patreon by Mastercard.

427
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,080
Not by PayPal, not by Visa, by Mattercard.

428
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,920
Not only for the possibility of continuing their work,

429
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,560
not for continuing their work with money, but for their services.

430
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,920
For this, Mastercard, specifically, is

431
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,760
maintaining the goal in its terms.

432
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,920
The commitment to move is what the business

433
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,000
of regular forms, consistent and consistent, in two motivations.

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,560
The importance of inclusion and the importance of data collection.

435
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
We can see that Mastercard is also the most important

436
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,040
motivation for the success of others.

437
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,620
In the 2000s, Mastercard started to

438
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,560
have a lot of relationships with mechanisms to present political events.

439
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,840
From their political and financial relations,

440
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,120
this process did not allow attention,

441
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
but it did make sense from what they said.

442
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,160
In the 2000s, Google took data from Mastercard

443
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,240
to show that their policies are online,

444
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,800
and they are offline.

445
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,440
This, of course, is not a surprise,

446
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,280
because big companies like Informatica and

447
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,400
Google have been associated with the data for many years.

448
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,360
But what does it have to do with Mastercard in all of this?

449
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,600
It has to be relevant,

450
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,960
because it is the declaration that there are political activities in Mastercard.

451
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,880
All political activities that Mastercard has seen in my head

452
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,360
are based on the interests of the company,

453
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,280
with complete and precise preferences of their official and exclusive services.

454
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,640
The same process is repeated in their work of conduct,

455
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,160
based on the fact that we are in the process

456
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,920
of making the forms responsible and ethical.

457
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,000
If Mastercard's post-oppression to PayPal,

458
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Payoneer, Stripe, or Patreon, sorry,

459
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,880
David Horowitz, Subscribestar, or Shihatwatch,

460
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,400
this declaration is clear,

461
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,360
which does not promote ideological ideas,

462
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,640
if not because they want to represent the interests of a company.

463
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,960
But it is even more obvious that there is a special relationship between PayPal and Mastercard.

464
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,840
Similarly, the special relationship between Patreon and PayPal,

465
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,640
which I shared in my video earlier,

466
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,880
can be found in the article on PayPal's target,

467
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,360
obviously on Mastercard,

468
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
on my article in 2016.

469
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,680
Paypal and Mastercard expanded their association,

470
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,320
to benefit consumers,

471
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,560
investors, and financial institutions.

472
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,880
We can now see a list of the names of the companies

473
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,800
that made an increase on the other,

474
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,160
like Robert Seibert,

475
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,760
Nitin Srivastava,

476
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
Liam Spence,

477
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,240
Monica Yasuja,

478
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,720
John Mwangi,

479
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,760
Jesse Tran,

480
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,920
Karen Pascoe,

481
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,080
Attula Baig,

482
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,360
Rasia Sultana,

483
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,760
Beth Kitchener,

484
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,840
Roger Griffith,

485
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,080
Luke Olbridge,

486
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,040
Diego Steinhandler,

487
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,200
Adrian Collard,

488
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,760
and Eduardo Riggi.

489
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,080
I don't know what to say,

490
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,520
but please do not contact these people.

491
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,040
This is only to demonstrate how PayPal and Mastercard

492
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,000
have one of the best methods in the world of the other.

493
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,640
But,

494
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,880
as we are talking about numbers,

495
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
there is an interesting one.

496
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
George Soros and Mastercard

497
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,160
are there to help immigrants and refugees.

498
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,920
If you know George Soros,

499
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,760
people immediately tell you that he is anti-semitic,

500
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,800
and that he is competitive.

501
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,320
So, he is going to do everything possible to not be bullied.

502
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,680
He is going to be the principal of the people.

503
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,280
Obviously, he is a racist.

504
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,320
But there are various factors that are involved.

505
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,400
Other groups of activists in social rights,

506
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
Hope Not Hate,

507
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,720
and financial support through Open Society,

508
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
and also in the form of just being part of the law

509
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,800
and being part of the law in Southern debate,

510
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,040
when the remover was in defense of massive immigration.

511
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,320
So, George Soros and Mastercard are together

512
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,560
with the time of the economic immigrants.

513
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,360
So, what are the details in this case?

514
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,800
Well, in this case,

515
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,800
the plans of Mastercard and George Soros are aligned,

516
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,960
and we have the motivation and the means to help them.

517
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,680
We have the numbers of people annually,

518
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,800
and since the beginning of 2015,

519
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,280
we have started to focus on the inclusion of finance.

520
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,640
This is a concept that we always have.

521
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,160
We are in the six relationships that we have,

522
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,320
with PayPal and some other interesting numbers,

523
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,280
which are not part of this video.

524
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,360
Visa and American Express, for example,

525
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,400
are not part of the concept.

526
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,360
The concept has been declared a political submission,

527
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
but the main part is its members

528
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,600
that are globalist and liberal.

529
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,400
And the actual president of the concept, Richard Gass,

530
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,120
is an article on the title that says

531
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,360
that there are so many liberal people in the world.

532
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,600
In the case of Daniel,

533
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,200
which is a population movement in democratic countries,

534
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,840
the cause of his global project.

535
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,960
But it is also possible that political decisions

536
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,840
represent the interests of Mastercard.

537
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,400
None of the people are the people in the company.

538
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,840
Instead of Mastercard as a corporation,

539
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,400
to finance the market in the first place

540
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
is a very big and obvious challenge.

541
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,680
But certainly not the biggest and most important one.

542
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,160
Many of these JWs and people who want to help

543
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,840
to buy online Mastercard

544
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,000
because of the group's financial aid.

545
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,520
But the difference between Patreon

546
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
is that it does not have an effect.

547
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,840
If anything, Mastercard is a role active in politics.

548
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,240
There is an enormous number of panel presentations

549
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,200
and foundation opportunities for Mastercard.

550
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,600
There are many social and intersectional issues.

551
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,360
But there are some that are repeated throughout all of them.

552
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,720
What I would like to share with you is digital identity.

553
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,600
Digital identity is a function of the two motivations

554
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,000
that we started, inclusion and data.

555
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,280
For me, I would like to show you some examples of Mastercard

556
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,760
based on two different things.

557
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,800
Before we move on,

558
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,400
let's see how this works in the digital identity concept.

559
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,920
The recent increase in Mastercard financial aid

560
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,920
has been the leader of infinite

561
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,800
to think about the relationship between political and data.

562
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,720
Some of the people who work on Amazon,

563
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,080
Mastercard and PayPal,

564
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,040
have also been a part of the articular relationship

565
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,960
with inclusivity and data.

566
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,400
The idea of Mastercard is that

567
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,080
the data is on the new petroleum tax.

568
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,480
The CEO, Ajay Banga,

569
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,000
said that he considered the data as a public bank

570
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
and not only as a commercial market.

571
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,920
Multiple people with all sorts of Mastercards,

572
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,960
including officials at FFS Inclusion,

573
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,080
representatives of the diversity of Inclusion

574
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,480
and other real-life cards,

575
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,960
have been invited by Solpreza and Inclusion.

576
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
In special, Inclusion Financier,

577
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
which is a part of the digital identity club.

578
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,160
In one of my first SJ Weekly

579
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,880
I discussed an article about Inclusion Financier.

580
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
To be sure,

581
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,360
basically what I said is that

582
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,240
the bank system considers it to be good

583
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,280
when more people are engaged in the financial system,

584
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,040
which is through an account or a credit account.

585
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,520
Of course, it is good,

586
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,120
because it signifies more clients,

587
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,720
but it also represents a form

588
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,960
for which people have to access

589
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,680
a private financial system

590
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,760
with modern global financial systems.

591
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,360
And what makes people in the system

592
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,160
is diversity and inclusion,

593
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,280
because the people who have not been engaged

594
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,640
are engaged in the digital world.

595
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,120
This is linked with the other initiatives of Mastercard,

596
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,480
such as the migration in Africa

597
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,400
during the Cinclos Fin of Inversion

598
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,880
and collapse of the region,

599
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,600
or the red red area of Mastercard,

600
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,120
which can achieve digital financial forms

601
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,240
in other sectors and in political conflicts.

602
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,440
I don't know what these things are,

603
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,800
but I think that by looking at the third world market

604
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
you can achieve this kind of form

605
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,200
in order to pass the situation,

606
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,600
which is more expensive than being able to finance it.

607
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,280
But there are no chances that Mastercard

608
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,960
is getting this out of the fund of its own existence.

609
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,760
Remember,

610
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,920
when Mastercard was the company that made me

611
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,640
I could have done political work with the fund

612
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,400
to increase its profits.

613
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,560
Mastercard wanted to achieve

614
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,080
the profits of millions of new clients.

615
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,880
In 2020, I was in the business of diversity and progress,

616
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,840
including finance.

617
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
And then I became the emperor of economic immigrants,

618
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,360
the dissolution of international jobs,

619
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,240
positions of the extreme care of the people

620
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,000
that enabled all the narratives of the ultra-right

621
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to be sold out of the book,

622
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,680
in its last two years.

623
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,640
From the fourth notice of Mastercard,

624
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,520
when new companies are increasingly more inclusive

625
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,480
and opportunities for everyone.

626
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,800
The integration of the 25th,

627
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,360
as four Refugia missions,

628
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,720
to new communities is a theme

629
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,480
that is the result of the whole world.

630
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,800
Ironically, the solution to Refugia,

631
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,040
which is being adopted by a new company,

632
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,240
is to increase the opportunity and opportunities for everyone.

633
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,760
Mastercard is globally developed

634
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,240
with the commitment of the United States

635
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,640
to increase the access to essential technologies

636
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,720
and products that advance financial education

637
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,640
and to provide financial services

638
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,120
to communities that are being sold out of the world.

639
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,040
So, to answer this question,

640
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,360
if this is the power of the great economic sector,

641
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,040
it is to find Mastercard.

642
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,960
And Mastercard is going to be the leader of inclusion,

643
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,760
when in reality,

644
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,360
everyone who wants to have access to a new market,

645
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,280
back to the market of progress.

646
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,400
I mean the people with the same values.

647
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,680
The people are meant to be a member of the industry

648
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,520
that is not able to reveal their numbers,

649
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,880
by obvious reasons.

650
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,800
We know what they have to say.

651
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,320
I mean, for example,

652
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,200
the security of the world,

653
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
the security standards of the industry

654
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
in the market of goods,

655
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,000
or PCE of this.

656
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,560
They are made by the market of goods,

657
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,720
by the same company,

658
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,280
without the commitment of the government

659
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,840
and without regulations.

660
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,440
Some states are referring to PCE of this,

661
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,280
but only in reference to the new market.

662
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,160
They don't want the company to comply with these standards,

663
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,960
but they feel that it is protected

664
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
by the legal responsibility

665
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,720
in a filtration case of this.

666
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,800
My guess is that it is a filtration.

667
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,760
Visa and Mastercard don't want to contract

668
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,320
a foreign PCE of PCE,

669
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,680
which decides to pay a lot.

670
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,920
What would happen if we didn't?

671
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,000
We wouldn't be able to get access to Red,

672
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,960
and we wouldn't be able to make a payment online.

673
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,880
There is a huge interest to be able to get access to Red

674
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,920
and to have the capital's flux.

675
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,120
The value of everything is the number of security.

676
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,360
Mastercard and Visa have complete control

677
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,120
of their payments, not being effective.

678
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,160
If you can get their interest in any form,

679
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,120
you can use PCE of PCE to get your money.

680
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,200
The other businesses depend on Visa and Mastercard

681
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
to help them process their payments.

682
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
This is a mafia.

683
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,600
It is not a free market.

684
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,000
It is a very big mafia

685
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
that Paypal and Stripe are trying to find

686
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,200
and subscribe to to protect the interest of Patreon.

687
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,360
This is a mafia of the companies of the market.

688
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,880
They have control over the financial structure of the world.

689
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,400
I believe that the social market is being infiltrated by Mastercard.

690
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,960
Mastercard is using its infrastructure

691
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,840
to block people who have political differences

692
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,280
from accessing the global market.

693
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,160
The PCE of PCE is the agreement you can use,

694
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,360
unilaterally, to get access to whatever you need

695
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,440
to have a financial presence online.

696
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,040
Remember that Jacqueline Hart has a reference to this

697
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,160
in her book with Matt Christiansen.

698
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,960
Processing payments depends on our ability

699
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,680
to access the rest of the payment,

700
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,520
and we have to be able to access it.

701
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,880
If we are able to supply it,

702
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,720
what do we need to access it?

703
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,960
Well, why don't we do that?

704
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,000
Here is a PDF of his internal job,

705
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
the Mastercard deal.

706
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,280
In his article about the hot watch,

707
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,040
David Horowitz, Mastercard localizes

708
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,560
both of them,

709
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,120
to their political affiliations.

710
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
But, between the Mastercard deal,

711
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,680
the political affiliations are not considered.

712
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,880
The consequences are

713
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,760
that the continued adults,

714
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,840
the pharmaceuticals,

715
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
tobacco dealers,

716
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,040
and the silver lockers,

717
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,440
are all considered altruistic,

718
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,160
but there is not a mention of political affiliations.

719
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,880
And, certainly, there are other political affiliations

720
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,760
that don't support the most sensitive.

721
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,240
Why would Mastercard consider

722
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,240
only one of them as altruistic?

723
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,800
In case I want to represent an altruistic,

724
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,280
I want to put my plans at the right place.

725
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,920
But, well,

726
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,400
how do we apply this in real life?

727
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,320
Because this is only going to appear on Twitter.

728
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,560
I know that Twitter is going to be a personal account,

729
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,840
as well as the president of Mastercard.

730
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,160
And, of course.

731
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,880
Innovation, diversity, inclusion, support.

732
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
And, Twitter.

733
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,640
If you want to talk about the global conference

734
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,760
of the people of Bocconi, it's there.

735
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,880
The account of Mastercard

736
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
is the one that I was supposed to respond to.

737
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,520
The private and public associates

738
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,080
were influenced by the economic crisis and innovation.

739
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,000
But, we have to be careful

740
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,560
to apply it to the real world and to the real world.

741
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,400
We need to know how to adapt to global standards

742
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,240
and to be able to produce local barriers

743
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,840
to the global innovation.

744
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
And in this event,

745
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360
in 2015, I want you to know what I'm talking about.

746
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,160
Great discussions on the competition.

747
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,320
But, more standards are more important.

748
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,360
We are talking about the country being the source.

749
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,400
If you want to enter the line for all,

750
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,720
the idea is the same.

751
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,640
Nationalized movements

752
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,720
that bring global plans to Mastercard

753
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,320
are considered local barriers to be crucial.

754
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,160
Mastercard has to be able to get to the real world

755
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,480
and make sure that it's not autonomous.

756
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,720
So, if these are the rules,

757
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,960
what is the plan at the workplace?

758
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,400
Let's talk about two questions.

759
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
What is a clear example of the person

760
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,600
who is talking about all of this time?

761
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,320
There is one inclusivity of two.

762
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,760
Another is financially, for example,

763
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,920
and digital.

764
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,960
The corporation can be used in social terms.

765
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,720
In Mastercard, we are considering a sustainable model

766
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
that allows us to do good things.

767
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,680
I don't understand that they also have

768
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,480
the right to say no

769
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,640
to the government of the country.

770
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,160
They also come together as a country

771
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,440
with the appropriate conditions

772
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,280
to make a relationship between

773
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,840
the marketplace of Mastercard.

774
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,680
By declaring that the sophisticated consumers

775
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,200
with the smartphone have been ineffective.

776
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,640
This has been so good for the economic market

777
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,200
that it has not been used for the global economic system,

778
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,280
that it has not been used financially.

779
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,440
And yes,

780
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,080
there has been some of this.

781
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,480
In the art of Markle,

782
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,160
Ant and Poco are very happy to see that

783
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,760
they have succeeded in doing so.

784
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,480
They are also very happy with the economic market

785
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,880
for which they have been financially funded.

786
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,200
Ant also thinks that the diversity of inclusion

787
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,240
should be increased in all the levels

788
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,840
of the operation of the company,

789
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,280
from the services and products,

790
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,240
to the essential properties of universities

791
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,960
for their employees.

792
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,080
And if you look at one of the things

793
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,080
that is the famous model of Mastercard's Mastercard,

794
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,440
which is now released,

795
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,120
Ant is more than willing to have a conversation with us

796
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,080
in respect to how the monetary contribution

797
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,040
of the companies has influenced the position

798
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,000
of an independent market.

799
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Every Mastercard project is about diversity of inclusion.

800
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,960
Every one of them says things like

801
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,840
they don't have any sense of having the internet

802
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,880
of all the things,

803
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,160
if they don't have the internet of all people,

804
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,800
they are talking about things and things.

805
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,480
Because, like Ant,

806
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,880
Mastercard doesn't have the power

807
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,480
to exclude anyone who wants to see

808
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,920
some of the things they are interested in.

809
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,560
Mastercard will have the potential

810
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,760
of people not being characterized

811
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,360
in the economic market of the majority.

812
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,400
So, Chigatwatch, Imilow and Horowitz

813
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,920
have to be excited.

814
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,240
Mastercard will be interested in the actual mafia

815
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,640
of technological companies,

816
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,480
so that Gab, Bitchute and Subscribestar

817
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,120
will have to be excited.

818
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,040
And remember,

819
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,120
after all,

820
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,880
the political act of Mastercard is

821
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,520
based only on the economic sector of the company.

822
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,560
All of this was decided.

823
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,960
It's easy to put tweets and articles like this

824
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,200
and to share them with you

825
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,240
if you want to see my content in one of your videos.

826
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,520
See the videos on YouTube

827
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,240
about those things that have been going on in the last years.

828
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,320
Well,

829
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
if that's all what's going on in this country,

830
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,960
then it's going to be voluntary.

831
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,280
Because if all of this is the truth,

832
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,560
you won't find the important part.

833
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,640
This is digital identity.

834
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,800
The function of inclusion and data,

835
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
of political inclusion and social inclusion

836
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,360
with financial inclusion,

837
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,640
and what is significant to Mastercard.

838
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,400
I won't talk about it with ideology.

839
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
But let me tell you what I say.

840
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,440
These are two tweets,

841
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,640
very different and very different.

842
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,160
One is about Mastercard being built on social rights,

843
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,240
and the other is about

844
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,520
putting an global identity on a national level.

845
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,080
What one of those means

846
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,560
is the digital identity concept.

847
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,600
Here I share with you a few.

848
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Mastercard, I believe that the European Union

849
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,840
needs a digital market.

850
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,760
And Mastercard, I believe that Refugia

851
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,640
needs a digital identity document.

852
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,240
What connects these two things?

853
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,000
Digital identity.

854
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,680
The digital identity is the enemy of inclusion.

855
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,440
Digital identity is digital identity for refugia.

856
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,640
Digital identity for refugia.

857
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
The real identity is the first in the year

858
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,280
since the equality of gender.

859
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,120
One in Africa is ineffective.

860
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,400
Without digital identity,

861
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,480
the demography has been destroyed.

862
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,960
Mastercard works to integrate refugia.

863
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,880
Efficiency is ineffective.

864
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,760
Financial inclusion blocks social progress

865
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,280
and economic potential.

866
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,800
Diversity can't be something that is real.

867
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,000
This is all digital identity.

868
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,320
Inclusion is data.

869
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,520
Political inclusion.

870
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,920
Social inclusion.

871
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,880
Financial inclusion is the same thing

872
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,680
for Mastercard as a company.

873
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
This is the reason why

874
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,400
the refugia in the global financial system

875
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,640
is treated with the same level of security

876
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,240
as social justice.

877
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,800
This is the reason why digital identity

878
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,160
is a combination of inclusive and data.

879
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,760
And that's why this is the strategy of Mastercard.

880
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
There are so many people

881
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,880
who are possible in the financial system.

882
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,240
If this means supporting initiatives in Africa

883
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,560
against philanthropy,

884
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,680
that's fine.

885
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,080
If this means pushing motions

886
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,120
against the limits of refugia

887
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,880
against social justice,

888
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,520
that's fine.

889
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,640
But with this global financial system

890
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,240
and the exponential growth of its users,

891
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,680
it's important to keep the value

892
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,360
of equity in the equation,

893
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,040
the progress of its growth in firms and countries.

894
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,840
It's important to keep digital.

895
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,360
The financial legacies are social.

896
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,600
Hashtag, an effective social association.

897
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
One way that finance

898
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,880
and digital identity are completely digitalized

899
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,240
is to use the protocol PES and DDS

900
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,200
to personalize with any other person

901
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,840
who is a pong.

902
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,280
Ah, digitality against those immigrants on Facebook?

903
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,840
Well, not only on Facebook,

904
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,000
you can use it on the phone

905
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,840
and you can't use PayPal.

906
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,800
But your Mastercard

907
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
will not be able to buy it.

908
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,160
Your bank will process the page of the tool killer

909
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,320
and your digital identity will be revoked.

910
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,080
This is the way to prove that Mastercard is working.

911
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,560
Let's see how this works.

912
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,920
You need to excel people in society.

913
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,240
And don't refer to people

914
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,920
who are restaurant owners.

915
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,880
Don't listen to people

916
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,840
who are eating your food for what they eat.

917
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,280
Because participants from the Twitch channels

918
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,040
have been considered toxic.

919
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,280
But don't be afraid.

920
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,120
You need to know that the art department

921
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,760
has a video tutorial template.

922
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,600
I was just trying to rent a room

923
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,000
in an apartment building

924
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,160
and this ad that someone put out,

925
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,880
they Googled me,

926
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
they saw my,

927
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm assuming they saw my Twitter or Facebook or something

928
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,840
and it said that I used to work at Fox.

929
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,140
And they sent me back an email saying,

930
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
like, you know, we're sorry,

931
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,440
but we have different political views on you.

932
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
We hate Fox.

933
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,920
Good luck in your search for housing.

934
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,480
And this was actually the second time

935
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
that it happened.

936
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,600
First time it happened actually yesterday.

937
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,160
I met companies from the market

938
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,920
who are using a free structure

939
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,960
to block the company from being free

940
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
and which is illegal to buy

941
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
in the United States.

942
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,800
And every time I went to one of these things,

943
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,840
there was one idea in the social media

944
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,760
the progressive one.

945
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
The inclusive one is that these companies

946
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,880
are active in the air,

947
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
in order to understand how their politics

948
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,640
are completely completely co-opted

949
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,720
by the people of Negocios

950
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,160
that are doing the art.

951
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,080
This mentality,

952
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,360
of which I have used to be the most

953
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,720
minimal power that can be used

954
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,400
by people innocent of political motives,

955
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,000
has been in my head in society

956
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,640
during the last few years.

957
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,120
That being in a restaurant

958
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,400
is a small part of a massive problem

959
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,480
in bringing the forms that are Negocios

960
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,080
and one with the other.

961
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,440
When the social media started

962
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,880
in the country,

963
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,640
a number of television companies

964
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,160
were only a small part of this campaign.

965
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,040
I'm sure you will know the next one.

966
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,360
It's guaranteed.

967
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,520
We're going to have a lobby

968
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,200
of more than one hundred people

969
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,400
in the market

970
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,560
and more than the other.

971
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,200
It's guaranteed.

972
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,480
That's going to be the next campaign.

973
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,360
If you want to make a very straight line

974
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,640
or a digital way,

975
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,840
with a set of titles,

976
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,680
you can make it

977
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,800
even more intelligible.

978
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,840
But you can't make it

979
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,120
because you simply want to create

980
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,160
another number of studios

981
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,600
and a new one.

982
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,160
This is a way to allow the other

983
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,680
in the world to be ineffective.

984
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,120
There is digital identity

985
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,760
and the reaction of the social media

986
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
is too much.

987
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,720
It's an effective way

988
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,560
to procreate value

989
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,320
against all financial systems.

990
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
You can't control the value

991
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,680
of value if it's physically

992
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,720
in support of you.

993
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,440
You can't control the value of value

994
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,000
if it's not in support of your physical value.

995
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
That's why, for example,

996
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,560
you have to trust all the levels.

997
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,960
There are projects that you have to

998
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,080
trigger your contract

999
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,040
for a positive deposit.

1000
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,240
But I don't know if you want

1001
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,560
to use digital value

1002
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,120
or any other way.

1003
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,600
And there are these two things.

1004
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,120
Legally, it's incredibly easy.

1005
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,520
At the same time, digital values

1006
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,240
are easy to falsify,

1007
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,480
making them much more insecure.

1008
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,600
This is the reason for the fact

1009
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,440
that being ineffective

1010
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,120
is the enemy of inclusion,

1011
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,320
because inclusion is required

1012
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,360
to be included in your control.

1013
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
It's the reason for the fact

1014
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,880
that you are so anonymous.

1015
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
It's the reason for the fact

1016
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,760
that you are an anonymous animal

1017
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,200
and it's the reason for the fact

1018
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,000
that in the year 2017,

1019
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,280
the curse of Mastercard

1020
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,720
started to happen.

1021
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,320
It's time to promote inclusivity

1022
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,440
to achieve the goals

1023
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,120
that are required in inclusivity.

1024
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,760
The priorities are inclusivity

1025
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,400
that makes confidence.

1026
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,760
We can't take the life

1027
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,320
of security.

1028
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,840
When you deliver a pet,

1029
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,600
what is permitted?

1030
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,760
Who is going to represent this pet

1031
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,840
for Mastercard?

1032
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,760
The dog.

1033
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,080
So that's why I was the dog.

1034
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,160
As if I was Alex Jones,

1035
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,280
I'm the dog.

1036
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,840
And I'm not content.

1037
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,000
I didn't think of myself

1038
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,920
as being a person

1039
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,080
that prepares to be competitive.

1040
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,360
But all the dogs are here

1041
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,520
for what they do.

1042
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
And if you're in all this

1043
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,680
you're intrigued with pneumonia,

1044
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,200
compare it to all the tweets,

1045
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,680
one of the others.

1046
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Mastercard.

1047
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,760
The corporations that can

1048
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,000
minimize you in their social socials.

1049
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,080
Patreon.

1050
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,000
Mastercard.

1051
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,280
We're not sure what we're talking about.

1052
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,640
This culture is so much

1053
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,520
about Sargon, Jack Ellingart

1054
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,440
and Patreon.

1055
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
And I don't think that some of the

1056
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,400
poppies in Mastercard

1057
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,560
are about the remotion of Sargon.

1058
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,720
I think we are.

1059
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,880
Patreon and Paypal

1060
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
are talking about the type of

1061
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,200
obedience that Mastercard

1062
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,280
is talking about.

1063
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
They are talking about the

1064
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,840
rights of Mastercards

1065
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,920
without receiving direct orders.

1066
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,520
For now,

1067
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
the evidence is concrete

1068
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
that other companies

1069
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
and credit targets

1070
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,640
don't have involucrades.

1071
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm a bit of an extraneous person.

1072
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,760
But, in this moment,

1073
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,040
Mastercard has demonstrated

1074
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,440
to be morally repugnant

1075
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,400
in the best way possible.

1076
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,720
Open the decisions

1077
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,280
and the lessons of the day.

1078
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,080
Look for the expression of expression

1079
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,320
or the most strict immigration.

1080
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,120
Criticize the social and feminist justice.

1081
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
Contribute in any form

1082
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,040
of political support,

1083
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,200
nationalized or popular.

1084
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,440
Because all of these things

1085
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,760
that offend Mastercard

1086
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,680
so much in ideology

1087
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,760
like Negocius

1088
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,880
will be the use of these gigantic structures

1089
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,480
to try to replace them.

1090
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,000
And we are on this.

1091
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,520
The only reason for what we know

1092
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,640
is that all of this

1093
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,440
is the same as in Gamergate.

1094
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,840
A significant and significant point

1095
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,600
connected to people more importantly

1096
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
is that they are a part of the project

1097
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
and how they will be interviewed

1098
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,040
in some cases.

1099
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,800
Patreon,

1100
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,640
yes,

1101
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,720
is so significant.

1102
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,280
But if you convert it into an internet

1103
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,600
through which we can see

1104
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,120
the mechanisms of the incredibly corrupt

1105
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,800
financial industry,

1106
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,000
you have all the experiences

1107
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,640
that the efforts of Jordan Peterson

1108
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,360
have created an alternative platform

1109
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,560
that is so much more productive.

1110
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,920
You have all the experiences

1111
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,560
that YouTube World is preparing

1112
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,400
to present to the Federal Commission

1113
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,960
so that they can start an investigation

1114
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,200
of Patreon and PayPal

1115
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,240
in one way or another.

1116
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,720
Can I do something

1117
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,320
that can actually make a difference here

1118
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,480
beyond the protest,

1119
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,840
beyond the speaking about it,

1120
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,120
beyond the explanation?

1121
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
And until somebody else picks up the mantle,

1122
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,200
I figure I'm in a unique position

1123
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,440
to actually do something here

1124
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,560
because I'm an attorney.

1125
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,520
Now I know that some people

1126
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,480
are trying to work

1127
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,840
on potential alternative platforms

1128
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,560
and alternative payment processing

1129
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,320
and I think that's great,

1130
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,880
but I think that we need to try to do our best

1131
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,360
to actually stop the practice.

1132
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,000
So I decided to file a complaint

1133
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,240
with the Federal Trade Commission

1134
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,160
against Patreon and PayPal

1135
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,360
for collusion.

1136
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,800
Now this is frankly a massive undertaking

1137
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,920
so I basically want to tell you my story,

1138
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,040
why I decided it and what I'm going to do

1139
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,320
and what it would take to actually succeed

1140
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,880
because frankly, I need your help on this.

1141
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,320
I have all the experiences that Jack Conte,

1142
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,840
CEO of Patreon,

1143
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,440
wants to make an appeal

1144
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,440
and to know the truth about all of us.

1145
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,160
Because frankly,

1146
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,920
Jack, your company is the arena.

1147
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,040
And if you're going to fund it,

1148
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,760
the best fund is to send the money

1149
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,560
and to open it in the next year,

1150
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,040
but I'm saying that you have to pay the bills.

1151
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,640
We have to pay the bills,

1152
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,160
if you're going to do that.

1153
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,520
But before that,

1154
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,400
the only reason why

1155
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,480
your financial platform is not functioning

1156
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,080
is because you can't find a bank

1157
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,800
to process your payments.

1158
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,440
It's possible that this is a very difficult problem

1159
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,480
from what we've imagined in principle.

1160
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,120
Many things that simply mean that

1161
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,960
Patreon has paid for Jack and Jack

1162
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,080
to buy our appropriate platform,

1163
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,400
or what it is.

1164
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,080
But I also think that we are in a situation

1165
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,680
where we have to pay the bills.

1166
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,360
More money can be made,

1167
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,680
but the more that my money is spent,

1168
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,840
it's better than what we're asking.

1169
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,920
At the same time,

1170
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,640
the next piece that we're going to talk about

1171
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,200
in the Internet of Patreon

1172
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,360
is the mechanism for which

1173
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,960
most of it is Hitler's transformation.

1174
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,200
The controversial one is extremist.

1175
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,120
Its provocateur is expanded and transformed.

1176
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,560
And the human being is inspired by terrorism

1177
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,080
or Nazi philosophy.

1178
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,040
Basically,

1179
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,480
the forms of these people

1180
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,000
transform into expression

1181
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,600
in ways to justify the sense of personalization.

1182
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,040
This, if said,

1183
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,560
is the reason why all of the media's

1184
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,120
communication methods

1185
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,200
have emphasized the capacity of Sargon

1186
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,560
and others to inspire act of violence.

1187
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,200
Don't commit act of violence to each other

1188
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,640
but to inspire others.

1189
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,880
This is the reason why the majority of media

1190
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,080
use terms like

1191
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,760
adjacent to the right

1192
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,040
or the right of the extreme.

1193
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,440
Because they guarantee that someone,

1194
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,520
in some way,

1195
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,320
will be in the mastercard

1196
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,360
or in the exterior of the sector

1197
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,240
and they will be able to utilize

1198
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,320
anti-terrorism methods

1199
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,680
such as the measures of security

1200
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,560
of the great informatics companies

1201
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,120
to make the most simple of the political decisions

1202
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,200
as if it were the catalogued

1203
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
discourse of the audience.

1204
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,040
Using the excuse of the inspiration.

1205
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,480
Because of Trump or Brexit,

1206
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,640
this is the signifier

1207
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,120
of the rise in the coming of the US

1208
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,280
to consolidate digital identity.

1209
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
And all of this, because of this,

1210
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,040
has been said a lot on the internet.

1211
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,520
There are several books about this video.

1212
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,480
There is a correction that no one

1213
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,720
has read online during the time of the war.

1214
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,200
There are also several books about

1215
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,360
all of the world,

1216
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,240
in all social rights.

1217
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,280
I'll tell you.

1218
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,040
Generally,

1219
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,840
there are no types of things.

1220
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,040
But it is well known

1221
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,680
in the Greek literature.

1222
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,360
If you have connections with a member

1223
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,800
of the intellectual rights race

1224
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,960
like Jordan Peterson or Derek Rubin,

1225
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,960
or even people with no politics

1226
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,840
like PewDiePie or Encea,

1227
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,720
you can download this video.

1228
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,800
You can also download the books.

1229
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,560
I'm not interested in receiving the credit.

1230
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,400
But it is important that we are not in the creative realm.

1231
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,200
And I don't think that this is a Patreon or PayPal.

1232
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,600
I would like to thank Monro and YouTube for their

1233
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,720
contributions to form a big part of this video.

1234
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,280
Simply by doing what I do,

1235
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,600
there is a version that you can watch.

1236
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,920
I don't want to be surprised,

1237
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,600
but I would like to mention on Twitter

1238
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,320
to make a free book for you.

1239
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,360
If you want to know about me

1240
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,240
and my projects,

1241
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,120
you can find a link to it in the description below.

1242
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,240
Today, Game Boomer Show.

1243
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
I talk regularly about these things.

1244
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,240
If you want to watch my tracks financially,

1245
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,000
well,

1246
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,280
this is a bit complicated, right?

1247
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,920
But I can make a few videos on PayPal.com

1248
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,240
via Short Photo Taco.

1249
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,320
Or maybe on Twitch,

1250
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,240
on Twitch.tv

1251
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,920
via Game Boomers.

1252
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,160
You have to check out my Patreon

1253
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,800
because it is only necessary.

1254
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,000
But I can't recommend it with a drink.

1255
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,520
And to do this,

1256
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,000
I will just put it in the description below.

1257
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,480
And...

1258
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,120
If you want me to not be able to

1259
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,240
make a big part of this video in time,

1260
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,240
and not simply to relish my videos with my friends,

1261
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,880
go to this Twitch page.

1262
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,760
I will continue all of the days of the week

1263
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,880
till the end.

1264
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,720
I hope to see you.
