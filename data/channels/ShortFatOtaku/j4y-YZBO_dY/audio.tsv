5960	12480	In my video about Team Squirrel, I told you that this information is important, so let's get to the second story.
12480	17800	First, when I told you that Team Squirrel was the public force because of the platform,
17800	23000	and immediately because they were involucred, and that Paypal and Stripe were going to make a Subscribestar,
23000	25600	I didn't include the capture of those pants.
25600	27200	So, let's look at some of these.
27200	28840	Look at this picture of this.
28840	32280	Well, when I told you that Team Squirrel was the public force because of the platform,
32280	34840	one of the people I invited to regularize their work,
34840	37720	was sexually abused by various members of the committee.
37720	40440	Team Squirrel had this three years ago,
40440	43760	only because the information was filtered by other people.
43760	47480	This was due to the lack of respect for the use of the platform.
47480	50680	During my time as the president of Team Squirrel,
50680	52160	I was also the director of the network.
52160	57160	A few years ago, I was on Twitter and frequently invited to talk to members of the committee.
57160	59640	Informally, I told them that I would not be able to invite them.
59640	62440	I was not sure that it would be encrypted by a member of the committee,
62440	65920	and that the members of the committee would be involved in the situation.
65920	68160	Finally, the Subscribestar was sent.
68160	69560	I was able to talk to these people,
69560	76800	and they could help me to ensure that this person was completely exiled from the Cambridge Center.
76800	79480	I was not exonerated, and they were fired.
79480	82040	I was scared that other people would be replaced.
82040	85000	And that was all possible, because of the use of the platform.
85000	90680	When I was young, I was scared that other people would not be able to have access to the status.
90680	94240	I could not name the person in question because of the use of the platform.
94240	98600	It was a problem that regularly existed in academic work.
98600	100480	I used to be able to do it.
100480	102200	I had no idea.
102200	105760	I could not do other things that would have helped me to make a future.
105760	108600	I was going to do it, but I was going to do it better.
108600	115480	How many people would say that when Milo and I would not be able to explain to them what had happened in Hollywood,
115480	118800	despite the lack of information about the members of the committee.
118800	121520	Some people attacked one of the subjects, which was Welton,
121520	125560	because he was my brother, and presented the same thing to me.
125560	127920	You know, I lived in Hollywood a while ago.
127920	130360	Did you? Did you go to one of his parties?
130360	135160	I went to other people who I won't name, of a similar stature in Hollywood.
135160	140680	I went to their boat parties and to their house parties and things, and some of the things I have seen have beggared belief.
140680	143320	Yeah? Can you give us like a...
143320	148200	Well, just, I can't, I don't want to be indiscreet about specific people.
148200	151040	Right, you don't have to do that. Just dance around the facts.
151040	154040	Yeah, dangerous, but I can tell you the truth without dropping anyone in it.
154040	157080	I mean, some of the boys there were very young.
157080	157680	Very young.
157680	158800	And this is really recently?
158800	161400	I don't remember, no, no, like, I don't know, eight years ago.
161400	162480	I don't remember...
162480	164080	Stactional limitations.
165080	171640	I don't remember whether I ever met Brian Singer or whether I even knew who he was then.
171640	176480	But I knew other people of similar stature, as I say, and there were some very young boys around at that time.
176480	178320	There was a lot of drugs, and a lot of...
178320	179280	Twinks.
179280	183400	A lot of twinks, taking drugs and having unsafe sex with older men, and some of these boys were very young.
183400	186880	But the most fascinating result is when people of my age want to progress,
186880	188720	and they are left with a lot of bad things.
188720	193400	And they have to ask if they are going to sacrifice themselves in the number of poor people,
193400	195600	or if they are going to be burdened by the virus,
195600	198800	because they are simply too important for the cause.
198800	203320	For those of you who are watching this last group, of those who are sleeping giants,
203320	206120	I'm sure you've seen it in a video on that.
206120	208520	But well, it's not sufficient, this is Rodolfo Rancida.
208520	211480	The Patreon page is still constant in my last video.
211480	214800	I wanted to share some important points between more and more people.
214800	220720	Many creators, like me, went to the platform where they were able to buy their own terms of service,
220720	224840	and the word of the company's name, to try to find a good way to do it.
224840	227480	But it seems that Patreon has entered a bit of a panic.
227480	229560	In the department, I'm sure of my confidence.
229560	235720	In the case of Jacqueline Hart, one of my stories has extended my view of the socialistic republic of Patreon,
235720	238800	and I think it's not only about you, it's about Matt Christensen.
238800	240680	One of my recapitulations.
240680	243320	Jacqueline Hart wanted to be a cooperative family.
243320	245280	She has experience in taxes and finances,
245280	248480	but she wanted to be a part of her time in conferences about women,
248480	251160	about diversity, and things like that.
251160	253120	The main thing is the audience.
253120	255560	One of them is Luana Vandonado,
255560	259360	from Patreon's Patreon page,
259360	264640	who told me directly about the topic and told me about all the information needed.
264640	267240	Our experience with each creator is individual,
267240	270960	and I'd like to talk about what I can do to help our audience.
270960	275320	More specifically, I'd like to thank the audience for their experience with Patreon and their support,
275320	277880	and what they've done in the work that they do.
277880	281080	Now, remember this message that I didn't do for Nade.
281080	283600	This Patreon is trying to secure their own stories,
283600	287960	and the description of it is for an exclusive discussion about the rules and the causes of one of them.
287960	292400	And I'm sure you'll be able to tell me that the idea of what depends is secure with you.
292400	294040	You can share it with others.
294040	297240	Well, this message that I gave on the phone at the end of December
297240	299480	between Matt Christiansen and Jacqueline Hart.
299480	301240	I'm going to leave the description on the table.
301240	303560	And if you want to see the video I'm going to share with you,
303560	305400	I'm going to share it with you.
305400	307920	It's very good news for the people of Mujar,
307920	311280	but I'd like to introduce what I believe are two integral points.
311280	313320	Matt and Jacqueline are good news in a principle
313320	314920	for the expression of expression,
314920	317320	and because people are going under the platform.
317320	320640	The one I'm going to tell you about is Jacqueline.
320640	322640	The problem is that Patreon is so bad,
322640	324840	and I believe that we can get to the first point
324840	327160	and there are other things that we need to consider.
327160	330920	First, our financial transition to the graduation class.
330920	332320	To be able to complete our transition,
332320	334520	we have created a community of graders
334520	337240	who are so much like us in the platform.
337240	339120	If we wanted to make some expressions,
339120	342040	which are some expressions of expression,
342040	344400	then it's only the graders that use Patreon
344400	346840	that don't have any problems with these decorative forms,
346840	349040	they are the ones who use the platform,
349040	350640	and our transition is very bad.
350640	354360	But, besides, as a platformer in Brazil,
354360	357480	processing pages is one of our nuclear values.
357480	360240	And we depend on the processing of pages
360240	361480	that have the appropriate rules
361480	364440	on what you are going to be processing, and what not.
364440	367960	Matt, I was thinking that this Patreon decision
367960	370280	would be something that the president wouldn't do.
370280	372280	Jacqueline, no.
372280	374760	This was entirely a decision by Patreon.
374760	378000	Matt, well, I'm not sure why you're passing the card
378000	379040	over there, Matt.
379040	382360	Jacqueline, no, I'm not passing the card over there.
382360	384600	We have some linear terms.
384600	387200	I'm trying to explain that, number one,
387200	389120	our transition is financed by the graders,
389120	393080	and that, obviously, some people don't want to be associated.
393080	395560	Matt, well, if it's a mission,
395560	399000	then the processing of pages is irrelevant.
399000	400200	It's a mission.
400200	401920	That's what I'm talking about.
401920	405520	Jacqueline, we're not using the card.
405520	407320	We don't have the rules.
407320	408600	That's what I'm saying.
408600	410640	There's a track on all of this.
410640	412120	There's also a contradiction.
412120	414280	For the fact that the decision to share the card
414280	416400	with you is completely a Patreon,
416400	417680	but by the way,
417680	419880	there are no visas and Mastercards,
419880	421920	and they are not what are the rules.
421920	423880	So we have three possibilities.
423880	426320	One, this Patreon decision
426320	428280	always has extreme forces,
428280	431520	with which a boycott of the social areas is justified.
431520	435720	Two, visa and Mastercard are forcing a Patreon on this,
435720	436720	and it's a bit of both
436720	439880	that companies have an interest in Sargon.
439880	443920	Or three, that a company has an ideological line,
443920	446160	and that it's a thing.
446160	447800	There's a demand for a ride,
447800	450600	and with what Patreon is doing internally,
450600	452760	I think it's a big problem.
452760	454160	We have a second point
454160	456680	that I want to share with the three Christians in my heart,
456680	459000	the inerrant success that Patreon has adopted
459000	460920	as part of their solutions.
460920	463960	Jacqueline, the second one is that we have a reason
463960	466680	that we are observing all of your work and determining
466680	469120	if this is something that is multiplexed.
469120	471640	We have to see these things as your work,
471640	473520	and as good as possible.
473520	477400	Matt, are you saying that you are an individual?
477400	478480	Jacqueline?
478480	479600	Yes.
479600	482760	Matt, how is it possible that you are a standard?
482760	485720	Don't you want to be a platform for everything?
485720	489160	Jacqueline, this is a very good question.
489160	492640	And yes, I would like to see a platform for everything,
492720	494200	but as you can imagine,
494200	496640	it's very difficult to do it manually.
496640	499360	And it's very clear that we want to see this direction,
499360	501120	because I think it's a human element.
501120	503400	Today, we have humans that resonate with us
503400	505120	and contact us with creators,
505120	507160	and for that reason, they resonate with us.
507160	509720	But we want this to be a platform
509720	513000	that can be used as a platform for three private products.
513000	516400	We want these to be analytic.
516400	520880	Matt, are you saying that you are an individual?
520880	521600	Jacqueline?
521600	522480	Yes.
522480	523760	I understand.
523760	525040	Matt?
525040	526240	Okay.
526240	528840	I understand that you are someone who is creators like me,
528840	532640	and to all the people who are confused about your platform,
532640	534240	Jacqueline.
534240	538160	What we are trying to do is to have the most possible tools
538160	539720	to be able to be transparent
539720	541800	and consider all the points of view.
541800	544880	We want to ensure that we are not operating on a camera.
544880	546120	We don't want to have a process
546120	548200	where we consider different opinions
548200	550280	when we are creators.
550280	551440	This is my point about this,
551440	555120	but I am partially concerned with Jacqueline's report.
555120	558760	We want the concept of the spirit of the letter of the law.
558760	560200	The exception to the law,
560200	562240	but one of the exceptions exists,
562240	563880	and many of these can be necessary
563880	566800	that the law and the laws are in crisis,
566800	569000	so we can live with extraordinary circumstances
569000	571800	that were not thought about.
571800	572800	From this point of view,
572800	575360	not only do you understand and know that it is preferable
575360	578360	that the law is used by human beings.
578360	580600	For example, the biggest problem with YouTube
580600	583400	is that it is essentially this subjective choice.
583400	586200	Since the copyright laws are proposed for both,
586200	589640	they don't have any context or use for them.
589640	593120	Although I don't think I have any experience in this area,
593120	595400	but I find that people who want to do things,
595400	596840	subjective and just,
596840	599240	are one of the biggest problems in the system.
599240	601480	There are people from all over the world,
601480	603880	and they are looking at everything, case by case.
603880	606560	If you look at this from a dialogical perspective,
606560	609000	you can completely understand the context
609000	610800	of the law and the law,
610800	613600	so the things that exist are good.
613600	615480	But that is not what they are saying.
615480	618280	I think it is subjective that they want to try something
618280	619840	that is much more tyrannical
619840	622760	than an automatically automated option.
622760	624800	And the comments from Jacqueline from my channel,
624800	626560	that the subjective system of Patreon
626560	628800	doesn't only try to try something in any form,
628800	629960	if not from each,
629960	631200	if it's an ideology.
631200	632160	Jacqueline.
632160	634920	Otherwise, this is the case by case.
634920	637080	Every creator has the opportunity to talk.
637080	639280	I want this to be completely clear.
639280	641240	Every time we talk about Algen,
641240	643680	this person has the opportunity to talk.
643680	646680	That was true when I was a child, for example,
646680	648880	but the time with the public opinion,
648880	650400	which expressed respect for the group
650400	651720	with which they were associated
651720	653480	and which we cancelled out,
653480	655440	had to come from the creator's side.
655440	657800	So, if you see what I'm saying,
657800	658680	I think there are a lot of people
658680	661760	who don't believe that this is going to happen.
661760	663240	Matt.
663280	665720	Okay, so it's a very subjective choice
665720	668960	if the reputability was sufficiently good.
668960	669880	Jacqueline.
669880	673000	Basically, you can shoot different groups on Patreon,
673000	674760	but if a creator is there
674760	676800	or actively opposed to these groups,
676800	679800	then it's not going to be permitted on the platform.
679800	681080	Matt.
681080	683720	I'm going to go, and I'm going to go.
683720	686000	Decho has his photography on me.
686000	688920	This is a form of a person who is pro-crypto
688920	691240	who can pro-crypto me for his association.
691240	693280	I'm going to go now, I'm going to go.
693280	695000	I think I'm going to go.
695000	695840	Jacqueline.
695840	697440	No, for some reason I can't.
697440	699480	The time is when my respect for the group
699480	701400	doesn't have anything to do with this.
701400	703920	But the time is not with the group
703920	704760	that they are associated with.
704760	706720	It's more about the group that they are associated with.
706720	707760	Matt.
707760	709640	Well, I'm going to go,
709640	711200	and I'm going to go on Patreon.
711200	714080	Why don't you do a similar session?
714080	715360	Jacqueline.
715360	716800	To the group, it's not the same
716800	720080	that I'm talking about on the other side.
720080	721160	Matt.
721160	723400	What is it that made you want to be on the other side
723400	725640	of this network?
725640	726560	Jacqueline.
726560	728520	I don't want to talk about specific things.
728520	731200	Really, Matt.
731200	732360	Why don't you send me a mail
732360	734880	that references a specific case?
734880	736520	The network is called Charla.
736520	738240	It's the one that I wrote.
738240	740080	In the New York Times article,
740080	742760	Patreon excluded anti-feminists for racist discourse,
742760	744240	indicating a result.
744240	745200	It is possible that,
745200	746960	given the political views of Patreon,
746960	748040	the company has been contacted
748040	749440	with the interview and the question,
749440	751080	and they have made specific plans.
751080	753240	They have included in the world the material
753240	754440	that has led to politics
754440	756400	and has made a public discourse.
756400	758280	I would like to say that
758280	759440	we have been in the hands of the creators
759440	760400	and we have worked with them
760400	762360	in a way of one to one.
762360	764520	And yet, all the creators are reformers.
764520	767000	So, it's a very exciting process.
767000	770480	Sargon has not responded to the platform of Patreon.
770480	773520	Patreon has not seen its creators as clients.
773520	775680	They seem like children who are vigilant
775680	777800	and, when they cross the line,
777800	779240	uneducated.
779240	781240	Or, in their own words,
781240	782440	they are made of the man.
782440	784440	Even human beings with the same respect
784440	787560	participate involuntarily in the process of reform,
787560	789200	with the question of principles.
789200	791440	Patreon is a company of tyranos,
791440	793360	where the most important thing is to reduce,
793360	794560	especially in the news,
794560	795800	to admit that you are a victim
795800	797320	and to ask for your pardon.
797320	799160	That is not to create a negative relationship,
799160	801280	to create a relationship between your guests.
801280	802200	During all times,
802200	804760	it is the principle of the sake of Patreon's support,
804760	807640	but it is also that the heart is at the center of everything.
807640	810760	In the next episode, we are going to talk about what this is all about.
810760	813160	First, let's see how the time has passed,
813160	814680	because if you are a young person
814680	815760	at this event,
815760	817880	and you want to know what happens the next time,
817880	820280	we will see Jacqueline's career in LinkedIn,
820280	821920	the one that she has been working on.
821920	823240	My question would be,
823240	826240	what is the most that she is trying to solve?
826240	828680	And here is a time limit for you to consider.
828680	830960	The 30th of October 2008,
830960	832200	Patreon has been an event
832200	834560	based on the recent administration for workers.
834560	836360	Jacqueline has been at this conference
836360	837360	for a long time,
837360	840200	and during that time,
840200	842160	she has been working on the recent administration
842160	844200	of her colleagues at PayPal.
844200	845760	The 30th of April in Patreon
845760	847880	is much more than ideal.
847880	849600	The present of PayPal,
849600	850840	David Marcus,
850840	853240	has invited Patreon to show their support.
853240	855640	Another significant member of Patreon
855640	857200	is Thrive Capital,
857200	860080	which is also an important member of Thrive.
860080	862400	And, as a part of the group,
862400	863720	Joshua Kushner,
863720	865440	Raman of Jared Kushner,
865440	867040	Nueva de Nueva del Tramp,
867040	869720	is also the founder of Thrive Capital.
869720	871360	Despite the great separation of Tramp,
871360	872920	I have no idea what the Emperor told us
872920	874480	when he pushed us to do it.
874480	875640	It's a bargain.
875640	877280	The final result of Sleeping Giants
877280	878560	has also been attacked by Thrive
878560	879600	two months ago,
879600	880880	during the attack in Aqaba.
880880	882400	I don't know about the attention,
882400	883960	but Thrive has been so happy
883960	886400	to be able to support the subscription service
886400	887600	that Team Squirrel
887600	888600	has also invited a potential
888600	889840	for Sleeping Giants.
889840	891160	We are extremely happy when Thrive
891160	893000	has been able to,
893000	923000	to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
923000	953000	be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
953000	955160	to remove Sargon's financing.
955160	957840	It's possible that the Twitch account doesn't benefit from that.
957840	959960	But Team Squirrel and platform hate
959960	963760	don't know how to deal with connections as important as Senna's,
963760	965520	the one that makes things happen.
965520	967760	And you have to remember Jacqueline's admission
967760	970680	that Patreon doesn't monitor her service,
970680	973360	and that she has to report to her users.
973360	976800	The Twitch account can do everything it needs to do for Senna's team.
976800	978440	And in that moment,
978440	982080	all that Patreon needs is one that can be used against her.
982080	983920	And of course, Chazaben,
983920	985480	who wants to go there
985480	987320	to be able to make a reason.
987320	990200	All that's needed is an excuse to use it.
990200	992320	It's not a definitive pro,
992320	995520	but for me, at least, it's how it is.
995520	998520	If this is the project that Patreon is using as a game market,
998520	1000000	it's going to be new.
1000000	1002040	The game market music is too.
1002040	1004800	Where the monumental market of a very corrupt game
1004800	1006720	exposes the corruption of the industry
1006720	1008720	and tracks different people
1008720	1010160	against different threats,
1010160	1011400	controlling narratives,
1011400	1014280	and removing people from incorrect politics.
1014280	1016760	I think this is a very pertinent description,
1016760	1018360	because, as I said earlier,
1018360	1021760	the part of our new queen and the team that we have,
1021760	1024120	at the end of the game, is much more evident.
1024120	1027520	And that's why Patreon can be a very big part of it.
1027520	1031000	Jacqueline said that the decision to remove her service with Patreon
1031000	1033160	is not a visa, it's a mattercard.
1033160	1035880	It can't simply be a real one.
1035880	1039120	The mattercard is used to do things like this.
1039120	1041480	David Horowitz said that his Freedom Foundation
1041480	1043680	should remove the services of visa and mattercard
1043680	1045680	from the SSPL.
1045680	1048520	He declared that it was only a group of people.
1048520	1051960	A visa that could communicate that it was not an involuntary one.
1051960	1055280	SubscribeStar was invited by all the paid processors.
1055280	1057600	PayPal was a pioneer, Stripe,
1057600	1060440	including Ambas, Visa, and Mattercard.
1060440	1063800	In the meantime, Mastercard recorded all the services in the 2010s.
1063800	1065760	Here are the questions.
1065760	1070960	The companies that are trying to convert in the new decade
1070960	1076560	are going to do this, and they're not going to select what is good and what is bad.
1076560	1080960	In the 2000s, at WikiLeaks, Visa and Mattercard also created their services,
1080960	1082760	similar to Megablot.
1082760	1086480	And, as I said, WikiLeaks was already being invented,
1086480	1089000	Mattercard was used to remove the services.
1089000	1093920	In the past, it was the point of expanding governmental corruption.
1094000	1094420	The
1094420	1097680	package that they had was removed from Patreon by Mastercard.
1097680	1101080	Not by PayPal, not by Visa, by Mattercard.
1101080	1103920	Not only for the possibility of continuing their work,
1103920	1107560	not for continuing their work with money, but for their services.
1107560	1109920	For this, Mastercard, specifically, is
1109920	1111760	maintaining the goal in its terms.
1111760	1113920	The commitment to move is what the business
1113920	1118000	of regular forms, consistent and consistent, in two motivations.
1118000	1121560	The importance of inclusion and the importance of data collection.
1121560	1123560	We can see that Mastercard is also the most important
1123560	1126040	motivation for the success of others.
1126040	1128620	In the 2000s, Mastercard started to
1128620	1132560	have a lot of relationships with mechanisms to present political events.
1132560	1134840	From their political and financial relations,
1134840	1137120	this process did not allow attention,
1137120	1139760	but it did make sense from what they said.
1139760	1143160	In the 2000s, Google took data from Mastercard
1143160	1145240	to show that their policies are online,
1145240	1147800	and they are offline.
1147800	1150440	This, of course, is not a surprise,
1150440	1152280	because big companies like Informatica and
1152280	1155400	Google have been associated with the data for many years.
1155400	1158360	But what does it have to do with Mastercard in all of this?
1158360	1159600	It has to be relevant,
1159600	1162960	because it is the declaration that there are political activities in Mastercard.
1162960	1165880	All political activities that Mastercard has seen in my head
1165880	1168360	are based on the interests of the company,
1168360	1172280	with complete and precise preferences of their official and exclusive services.
1172280	1174640	The same process is repeated in their work of conduct,
1174640	1177160	based on the fact that we are in the process
1177160	1179920	of making the forms responsible and ethical.
1179920	1182000	If Mastercard's post-oppression to PayPal,
1182000	1184640	Payoneer, Stripe, or Patreon, sorry,
1184640	1187880	David Horowitz, Subscribestar, or Shihatwatch,
1187880	1189400	this declaration is clear,
1189400	1191360	which does not promote ideological ideas,
1191360	1194640	if not because they want to represent the interests of a company.
1194640	1198960	But it is even more obvious that there is a special relationship between PayPal and Mastercard.
1198960	1201840	Similarly, the special relationship between Patreon and PayPal,
1201840	1203640	which I shared in my video earlier,
1203640	1205880	can be found in the article on PayPal's target,
1205880	1207360	obviously on Mastercard,
1207360	1209840	on my article in 2016.
1209840	1212680	Paypal and Mastercard expanded their association,
1212680	1214320	to benefit consumers,
1214320	1216560	investors, and financial institutions.
1216560	1218880	We can now see a list of the names of the companies
1218880	1220800	that made an increase on the other,
1220800	1222160	like Robert Seibert,
1222160	1223760	Nitin Srivastava,
1223760	1225080	Liam Spence,
1225080	1227240	Monica Yasuja,
1227240	1228720	John Mwangi,
1228720	1229760	Jesse Tran,
1229760	1230920	Karen Pascoe,
1230920	1232080	Attula Baig,
1232080	1233360	Rasia Sultana,
1233360	1234760	Beth Kitchener,
1234760	1235840	Roger Griffith,
1235840	1237080	Luke Olbridge,
1237080	1239040	Diego Steinhandler,
1239040	1240200	Adrian Collard,
1240200	1241760	and Eduardo Riggi.
1241760	1243080	I don't know what to say,
1243080	1245520	but please do not contact these people.
1245520	1248040	This is only to demonstrate how PayPal and Mastercard
1248040	1251000	have one of the best methods in the world of the other.
1251000	1251640	But,
1251640	1252880	as we are talking about numbers,
1252880	1254640	there is an interesting one.
1254640	1256880	George Soros and Mastercard
1256880	1260160	are there to help immigrants and refugees.
1260160	1261920	If you know George Soros,
1261920	1264760	people immediately tell you that he is anti-semitic,
1264760	1266800	and that he is competitive.
1266800	1270320	So, he is going to do everything possible to not be bullied.
1270320	1272680	He is going to be the principal of the people.
1272680	1274280	Obviously, he is a racist.
1274280	1276320	But there are various factors that are involved.
1276320	1278400	Other groups of activists in social rights,
1278400	1280000	Hope Not Hate,
1280000	1282720	and financial support through Open Society,
1282720	1284640	and also in the form of just being part of the law
1284640	1286800	and being part of the law in Southern debate,
1286800	1290040	when the remover was in defense of massive immigration.
1290040	1292320	So, George Soros and Mastercard are together
1292320	1294560	with the time of the economic immigrants.
1294560	1297360	So, what are the details in this case?
1297360	1298800	Well, in this case,
1298800	1301800	the plans of Mastercard and George Soros are aligned,
1301800	1304960	and we have the motivation and the means to help them.
1304960	1307680	We have the numbers of people annually,
1307680	1309800	and since the beginning of 2015,
1309800	1314280	we have started to focus on the inclusion of finance.
1314280	1316640	This is a concept that we always have.
1316640	1319160	We are in the six relationships that we have,
1319160	1322320	with PayPal and some other interesting numbers,
1322320	1324280	which are not part of this video.
1324280	1326360	Visa and American Express, for example,
1326360	1328400	are not part of the concept.
1328400	1331360	The concept has been declared a political submission,
1331360	1332520	but the main part is its members
1332520	1334600	that are globalist and liberal.
1334600	1337400	And the actual president of the concept, Richard Gass,
1337400	1339120	is an article on the title that says
1339120	1341360	that there are so many liberal people in the world.
1341360	1342600	In the case of Daniel,
1342600	1345200	which is a population movement in democratic countries,
1345200	1346840	the cause of his global project.
1346840	1348960	But it is also possible that political decisions
1348960	1350840	represent the interests of Mastercard.
1350840	1353400	None of the people are the people in the company.
1353440	1355840	Instead of Mastercard as a corporation,
1355840	1357400	to finance the market in the first place
1357400	1359400	is a very big and obvious challenge.
1359400	1362680	But certainly not the biggest and most important one.
1362680	1365160	Many of these JWs and people who want to help
1365160	1366840	to buy online Mastercard
1366840	1369000	because of the group's financial aid.
1369000	1371520	But the difference between Patreon
1371520	1373520	is that it does not have an effect.
1373520	1376840	If anything, Mastercard is a role active in politics.
1376840	1379240	There is an enormous number of panel presentations
1379240	1382200	and foundation opportunities for Mastercard.
1382200	1385600	There are many social and intersectional issues.
1385600	1388360	But there are some that are repeated throughout all of them.
1388360	1391720	What I would like to share with you is digital identity.
1391720	1394600	Digital identity is a function of the two motivations
1394600	1398000	that we started, inclusion and data.
1398000	1400280	For me, I would like to show you some examples of Mastercard
1400280	1402760	based on two different things.
1402760	1403800	Before we move on,
1403800	1407400	let's see how this works in the digital identity concept.
1407400	1410920	The recent increase in Mastercard financial aid
1410960	1412920	has been the leader of infinite
1412920	1415800	to think about the relationship between political and data.
1415800	1417720	Some of the people who work on Amazon,
1417720	1419080	Mastercard and PayPal,
1419080	1421040	have also been a part of the articular relationship
1421040	1422960	with inclusivity and data.
1422960	1424400	The idea of Mastercard is that
1424400	1429080	the data is on the new petroleum tax.
1429080	1431480	The CEO, Ajay Banga,
1431480	1434000	said that he considered the data as a public bank
1434000	1436320	and not only as a commercial market.
1436320	1438920	Multiple people with all sorts of Mastercards,
1438920	1440960	including officials at FFS Inclusion,
1440960	1443080	representatives of the diversity of Inclusion
1443080	1445480	and other real-life cards,
1445480	1448960	have been invited by Solpreza and Inclusion.
1448960	1450720	In special, Inclusion Financier,
1450720	1453440	which is a part of the digital identity club.
1453440	1455160	In one of my first SJ Weekly
1455160	1457880	I discussed an article about Inclusion Financier.
1457880	1459080	To be sure,
1459080	1460360	basically what I said is that
1460360	1463240	the bank system considers it to be good
1463240	1466280	when more people are engaged in the financial system,
1466280	1469040	which is through an account or a credit account.
1469040	1470520	Of course, it is good,
1470520	1472120	because it signifies more clients,
1472120	1473720	but it also represents a form
1473720	1474960	for which people have to access
1474960	1476680	a private financial system
1476680	1478760	with modern global financial systems.
1478760	1480360	And what makes people in the system
1480360	1483160	is diversity and inclusion,
1483160	1485280	because the people who have not been engaged
1485280	1487640	are engaged in the digital world.
1487640	1490120	This is linked with the other initiatives of Mastercard,
1490120	1491480	such as the migration in Africa
1491480	1493400	during the Cinclos Fin of Inversion
1493400	1494880	and collapse of the region,
1494880	1496600	or the red red area of Mastercard,
1496600	1499120	which can achieve digital financial forms
1499120	1502240	in other sectors and in political conflicts.
1502240	1504440	I don't know what these things are,
1504440	1506800	but I think that by looking at the third world market
1506800	1508320	you can achieve this kind of form
1508320	1510200	in order to pass the situation,
1510200	1513600	which is more expensive than being able to finance it.
1513600	1515280	But there are no chances that Mastercard
1515280	1518960	is getting this out of the fund of its own existence.
1518960	1519760	Remember,
1519760	1521920	when Mastercard was the company that made me
1521920	1523640	I could have done political work with the fund
1523640	1525400	to increase its profits.
1525400	1526560	Mastercard wanted to achieve
1526560	1529080	the profits of millions of new clients.
1529080	1531880	In 2020, I was in the business of diversity and progress,
1531880	1533840	including finance.
1533840	1536400	And then I became the emperor of economic immigrants,
1536400	1538360	the dissolution of international jobs,
1538360	1540240	positions of the extreme care of the people
1540240	1543000	that enabled all the narratives of the ultra-right
1543000	1545000	to be sold out of the book,
1545000	1546680	in its last two years.
1546680	1548640	From the fourth notice of Mastercard,
1548640	1551520	when new companies are increasingly more inclusive
1551520	1553480	and opportunities for everyone.
1553480	1554800	The integration of the 25th,
1554800	1556360	as four Refugia missions,
1556360	1557720	to new communities is a theme
1557720	1560480	that is the result of the whole world.
1560480	1562800	Ironically, the solution to Refugia,
1562800	1565040	which is being adopted by a new company,
1565040	1568240	is to increase the opportunity and opportunities for everyone.
1568240	1569760	Mastercard is globally developed
1569760	1571240	with the commitment of the United States
1571240	1573640	to increase the access to essential technologies
1573640	1575720	and products that advance financial education
1575720	1577640	and to provide financial services
1577640	1580120	to communities that are being sold out of the world.
1580120	1582040	So, to answer this question,
1582040	1584360	if this is the power of the great economic sector,
1584360	1586040	it is to find Mastercard.
1586040	1588960	And Mastercard is going to be the leader of inclusion,
1588960	1589760	when in reality,
1589760	1592360	everyone who wants to have access to a new market,
1592360	1595280	back to the market of progress.
1595280	1598400	I mean the people with the same values.
1598400	1600680	The people are meant to be a member of the industry
1600680	1602520	that is not able to reveal their numbers,
1602520	1603880	by obvious reasons.
1603880	1605800	We know what they have to say.
1605800	1607320	I mean, for example,
1607320	1609200	the security of the world,
1609200	1610960	the security standards of the industry
1610960	1612720	in the market of goods,
1612720	1615000	or PCE of this.
1615000	1616560	They are made by the market of goods,
1616560	1617720	by the same company,
1617720	1619280	without the commitment of the government
1619280	1620840	and without regulations.
1620840	1624440	Some states are referring to PCE of this,
1624440	1626280	but only in reference to the new market.
1626280	1629160	They don't want the company to comply with these standards,
1629160	1630960	but they feel that it is protected
1630960	1632400	by the legal responsibility
1632400	1634720	in a filtration case of this.
1634720	1636800	My guess is that it is a filtration.
1636800	1638760	Visa and Mastercard don't want to contract
1638760	1641320	a foreign PCE of PCE,
1641320	1643680	which decides to pay a lot.
1643680	1645920	What would happen if we didn't?
1645920	1648000	We wouldn't be able to get access to Red,
1648000	1650960	and we wouldn't be able to make a payment online.
1650960	1654880	There is a huge interest to be able to get access to Red
1654880	1656920	and to have the capital's flux.
1656920	1660120	The value of everything is the number of security.
1660120	1662360	Mastercard and Visa have complete control
1662360	1665120	of their payments, not being effective.
1665120	1668160	If you can get their interest in any form,
1668160	1672120	you can use PCE of PCE to get your money.
1672120	1675200	The other businesses depend on Visa and Mastercard
1675200	1677440	to help them process their payments.
1677440	1678880	This is a mafia.
1678880	1680600	It is not a free market.
1680600	1682000	It is a very big mafia
1682000	1684080	that Paypal and Stripe are trying to find
1684080	1687200	and subscribe to to protect the interest of Patreon.
1687200	1690360	This is a mafia of the companies of the market.
1690360	1693880	They have control over the financial structure of the world.
1693920	1697400	I believe that the social market is being infiltrated by Mastercard.
1697400	1699960	Mastercard is using its infrastructure
1699960	1702840	to block people who have political differences
1702840	1706280	from accessing the global market.
1706280	1709160	The PCE of PCE is the agreement you can use,
1709160	1712360	unilaterally, to get access to whatever you need
1712360	1714440	to have a financial presence online.
1714440	1717040	Remember that Jacqueline Hart has a reference to this
1717040	1719160	in her book with Matt Christiansen.
1719160	1720960	Processing payments depends on our ability
1720960	1722680	to access the rest of the payment,
1722680	1724520	and we have to be able to access it.
1724520	1725880	If we are able to supply it,
1725880	1727720	what do we need to access it?
1727720	1729960	Well, why don't we do that?
1729960	1732000	Here is a PDF of his internal job,
1732000	1733600	the Mastercard deal.
1733600	1735280	In his article about the hot watch,
1735280	1738040	David Horowitz, Mastercard localizes
1738040	1739560	both of them,
1739560	1742120	to their political affiliations.
1742120	1744120	But, between the Mastercard deal,
1744120	1747680	the political affiliations are not considered.
1747680	1748880	The consequences are
1748880	1750760	that the continued adults,
1750760	1751840	the pharmaceuticals,
1751840	1752840	tobacco dealers,
1752840	1754040	and the silver lockers,
1754040	1756440	are all considered altruistic,
1756440	1759160	but there is not a mention of political affiliations.
1759160	1762880	And, certainly, there are other political affiliations
1762880	1764760	that don't support the most sensitive.
1764760	1766240	Why would Mastercard consider
1766240	1769240	only one of them as altruistic?
1769240	1772800	In case I want to represent an altruistic,
1772800	1775280	I want to put my plans at the right place.
1775280	1776920	But, well,
1776920	1779400	how do we apply this in real life?
1779400	1782320	Because this is only going to appear on Twitter.
1782320	1784560	I know that Twitter is going to be a personal account,
1784560	1787840	as well as the president of Mastercard.
1787840	1789160	And, of course.
1789160	1792880	Innovation, diversity, inclusion, support.
1792880	1793960	And, Twitter.
1793960	1795640	If you want to talk about the global conference
1795640	1797760	of the people of Bocconi, it's there.
1797760	1798880	The account of Mastercard
1798880	1800680	is the one that I was supposed to respond to.
1800680	1802520	The private and public associates
1802520	1805080	were influenced by the economic crisis and innovation.
1805080	1806000	But, we have to be careful
1806000	1808560	to apply it to the real world and to the real world.
1808560	1811400	We need to know how to adapt to global standards
1811400	1813240	and to be able to produce local barriers
1813240	1814840	to the global innovation.
1814840	1815840	And in this event,
1815840	1819360	in 2015, I want you to know what I'm talking about.
1819360	1821160	Great discussions on the competition.
1821160	1823320	But, more standards are more important.
1823320	1825360	We are talking about the country being the source.
1825360	1827400	If you want to enter the line for all,
1827400	1828720	the idea is the same.
1828720	1830640	Nationalized movements
1830640	1832720	that bring global plans to Mastercard
1832720	1836320	are considered local barriers to be crucial.
1836320	1839160	Mastercard has to be able to get to the real world
1839160	1841480	and make sure that it's not autonomous.
1841480	1843720	So, if these are the rules,
1843720	1845960	what is the plan at the workplace?
1845960	1847400	Let's talk about two questions.
1847400	1849400	What is a clear example of the person
1849400	1851600	who is talking about all of this time?
1851600	1854320	There is one inclusivity of two.
1854320	1856760	Another is financially, for example,
1856760	1857920	and digital.
1857920	1860960	The corporation can be used in social terms.
1860960	1864720	In Mastercard, we are considering a sustainable model
1864720	1866880	that allows us to do good things.
1866880	1868680	I don't understand that they also have
1868680	1870480	the right to say no
1870480	1872640	to the government of the country.
1872640	1874160	They also come together as a country
1874160	1875440	with the appropriate conditions
1875440	1877280	to make a relationship between
1877280	1878840	the marketplace of Mastercard.
1878840	1880680	By declaring that the sophisticated consumers
1880680	1883200	with the smartphone have been ineffective.
1883200	1885640	This has been so good for the economic market
1885640	1888200	that it has not been used for the global economic system,
1888200	1891280	that it has not been used financially.
1891280	1892440	And yes,
1892440	1894080	there has been some of this.
1894080	1895480	In the art of Markle,
1895480	1897160	Ant and Poco are very happy to see that
1897160	1898760	they have succeeded in doing so.
1898760	1901480	They are also very happy with the economic market
1901480	1903880	for which they have been financially funded.
1903880	1906200	Ant also thinks that the diversity of inclusion
1906200	1908240	should be increased in all the levels
1908240	1909840	of the operation of the company,
1909840	1911280	from the services and products,
1911280	1913240	to the essential properties of universities
1913240	1914960	for their employees.
1914960	1916080	And if you look at one of the things
1916080	1919080	that is the famous model of Mastercard's Mastercard,
1919080	1920440	which is now released,
1920440	1923120	Ant is more than willing to have a conversation with us
1923120	1926080	in respect to how the monetary contribution
1926080	1928040	of the companies has influenced the position
1928040	1930000	of an independent market.
1930000	1933000	Every Mastercard project is about diversity of inclusion.
1933000	1934960	Every one of them says things like
1934960	1936840	they don't have any sense of having the internet
1936840	1937880	of all the things,
1937880	1940160	if they don't have the internet of all people,
1940160	1942800	they are talking about things and things.
1942800	1944480	Because, like Ant,
1944480	1945880	Mastercard doesn't have the power
1945880	1948480	to exclude anyone who wants to see
1948480	1951920	some of the things they are interested in.
1951920	1953560	Mastercard will have the potential
1953560	1954760	of people not being characterized
1954760	1957360	in the economic market of the majority.
1957360	1960400	So, Chigatwatch, Imilow and Horowitz
1960400	1961920	have to be excited.
1961920	1964240	Mastercard will be interested in the actual mafia
1964240	1965640	of technological companies,
1965640	1968480	so that Gab, Bitchute and Subscribestar
1968480	1970120	will have to be excited.
1970120	1971040	And remember,
1971040	1972120	after all,
1972120	1974880	the political act of Mastercard is
1974880	1978520	based only on the economic sector of the company.
1978520	1980560	All of this was decided.
1980560	1982960	It's easy to put tweets and articles like this
1982960	1984200	and to share them with you
1984200	1987240	if you want to see my content in one of your videos.
1987240	1988520	See the videos on YouTube
1988520	1991240	about those things that have been going on in the last years.
1991240	1992320	Well,
1992320	1994320	if that's all what's going on in this country,
1994320	1996960	then it's going to be voluntary.
1996960	1999280	Because if all of this is the truth,
1999280	2001560	you won't find the important part.
2001560	2003640	This is digital identity.
2003640	2005800	The function of inclusion and data,
2005800	2007800	of political inclusion and social inclusion
2007800	2009360	with financial inclusion,
2009360	2011640	and what is significant to Mastercard.
2011640	2014400	I won't talk about it with ideology.
2014400	2016400	But let me tell you what I say.
2016400	2017440	These are two tweets,
2017440	2019640	very different and very different.
2019640	2023160	One is about Mastercard being built on social rights,
2023160	2024240	and the other is about
2024240	2027520	putting an global identity on a national level.
2027520	2029080	What one of those means
2029080	2031560	is the digital identity concept.
2031560	2033600	Here I share with you a few.
2033600	2035600	Mastercard, I believe that the European Union
2035600	2037840	needs a digital market.
2037840	2039760	And Mastercard, I believe that Refugia
2039760	2042640	needs a digital identity document.
2042640	2044240	What connects these two things?
2044240	2046000	Digital identity.
2046000	2048680	The digital identity is the enemy of inclusion.
2048680	2051440	Digital identity is digital identity for refugia.
2051440	2053640	Digital identity for refugia.
2053640	2055640	The real identity is the first in the year
2055640	2057280	since the equality of gender.
2057280	2059120	One in Africa is ineffective.
2059120	2060400	Without digital identity,
2060400	2062480	the demography has been destroyed.
2062480	2064960	Mastercard works to integrate refugia.
2064960	2066880	Efficiency is ineffective.
2066880	2069760	Financial inclusion blocks social progress
2069760	2071280	and economic potential.
2071280	2074800	Diversity can't be something that is real.
2074800	2077000	This is all digital identity.
2077000	2079320	Inclusion is data.
2079320	2080520	Political inclusion.
2080520	2081920	Social inclusion.
2081920	2083880	Financial inclusion is the same thing
2083880	2085680	for Mastercard as a company.
2085680	2086680	This is the reason why
2086680	2090400	the refugia in the global financial system
2090400	2092640	is treated with the same level of security
2092640	2094240	as social justice.
2094240	2096800	This is the reason why digital identity
2096800	2100160	is a combination of inclusive and data.
2100160	2102760	And that's why this is the strategy of Mastercard.
2102760	2103760	There are so many people
2103760	2105880	who are possible in the financial system.
2105880	2108240	If this means supporting initiatives in Africa
2108240	2110560	against philanthropy,
2110560	2111680	that's fine.
2111680	2113080	If this means pushing motions
2113080	2116120	against the limits of refugia
2116120	2118880	against social justice,
2118880	2120520	that's fine.
2120520	2122640	But with this global financial system
2122640	2125240	and the exponential growth of its users,
2125240	2126680	it's important to keep the value
2126680	2128360	of equity in the equation,
2128360	2131040	the progress of its growth in firms and countries.
2131040	2132840	It's important to keep digital.
2132840	2135360	The financial legacies are social.
2135360	2137600	Hashtag, an effective social association.
2137600	2138880	One way that finance
2138880	2141880	and digital identity are completely digitalized
2141880	2144240	is to use the protocol PES and DDS
2144240	2146200	to personalize with any other person
2146200	2147840	who is a pong.
2147840	2151280	Ah, digitality against those immigrants on Facebook?
2151280	2152840	Well, not only on Facebook,
2152840	2154000	you can use it on the phone
2154000	2155840	and you can't use PayPal.
2155840	2156800	But your Mastercard
2156800	2158800	will not be able to buy it.
2158800	2161160	Your bank will process the page of the tool killer
2161160	2164320	and your digital identity will be revoked.
2164320	2168080	This is the way to prove that Mastercard is working.
2168080	2169560	Let's see how this works.
2169560	2171920	You need to excel people in society.
2171920	2173240	And don't refer to people
2173240	2174920	who are restaurant owners.
2174920	2175880	Don't listen to people
2175880	2177840	who are eating your food for what they eat.
2177840	2180280	Because participants from the Twitch channels
2180280	2182040	have been considered toxic.
2182040	2183280	But don't be afraid.
2183280	2185120	You need to know that the art department
2185120	2186760	has a video tutorial template.
2186760	2188600	I was just trying to rent a room
2188600	2190000	in an apartment building
2190000	2194160	and this ad that someone put out,
2194160	2195880	they Googled me,
2195880	2196720	they saw my,
2196720	2199760	I'm assuming they saw my Twitter or Facebook or something
2199760	2201840	and it said that I used to work at Fox.
2201840	2205140	And they sent me back an email saying,
2206880	2208400	like, you know, we're sorry,
2208400	2211440	but we have different political views on you.
2211440	2212880	We hate Fox.
2212880	2214920	Good luck in your search for housing.
2214920	2216480	And this was actually the second time
2216480	2217480	that it happened.
2217480	2219600	First time it happened actually yesterday.
2219600	2221160	I met companies from the market
2221160	2222920	who are using a free structure
2222920	2224960	to block the company from being free
2224960	2226160	and which is illegal to buy
2226160	2228160	in the United States.
2228160	2229800	And every time I went to one of these things,
2229800	2232840	there was one idea in the social media
2232840	2233760	the progressive one.
2233760	2235760	The inclusive one is that these companies
2235760	2236880	are active in the air,
2236880	2238880	in order to understand how their politics
2238880	2240640	are completely completely co-opted
2240640	2241720	by the people of Negocios
2241720	2243160	that are doing the art.
2243160	2244080	This mentality,
2244080	2245360	of which I have used to be the most
2245360	2246720	minimal power that can be used
2246720	2249400	by people innocent of political motives,
2249400	2251000	has been in my head in society
2251000	2252640	during the last few years.
2252640	2254120	That being in a restaurant
2254120	2256400	is a small part of a massive problem
2256400	2258480	in bringing the forms that are Negocios
2258480	2260080	and one with the other.
2260080	2261440	When the social media started
2261440	2261880	in the country,
2261880	2262640	a number of television companies
2263520	2266160	were only a small part of this campaign.
2266160	2268040	I'm sure you will know the next one.
2268040	2269360	It's guaranteed.
2269360	2270520	We're going to have a lobby
2270520	2272200	of more than one hundred people
2272200	2273400	in the market
2273400	2275560	and more than the other.
2275560	2277200	It's guaranteed.
2277200	2279480	That's going to be the next campaign.
2279480	2281360	If you want to make a very straight line
2281360	2282640	or a digital way,
2282640	2283840	with a set of titles,
2283840	2284680	you can make it
2284680	2286800	even more intelligible.
2286800	2287840	But you can't make it
2287840	2289120	because you simply want to create
2289120	2290160	another number of studios
2290160	2291600	and a new one.
2291680	2293160	This is a way to allow the other
2293160	2294680	in the world to be ineffective.
2294680	2296120	There is digital identity
2296120	2297760	and the reaction of the social media
2297760	2298760	is too much.
2298760	2299720	It's an effective way
2299720	2300560	to procreate value
2300560	2302320	against all financial systems.
2302320	2303360	You can't control the value
2303360	2304680	of value if it's physically
2304680	2305720	in support of you.
2305720	2307440	You can't control the value of value
2307440	2310000	if it's not in support of your physical value.
2310000	2311400	That's why, for example,
2311400	2313560	you have to trust all the levels.
2313560	2314960	There are projects that you have to
2314960	2316080	trigger your contract
2316080	2318040	for a positive deposit.
2318040	2319240	But I don't know if you want
2319240	2320560	to use digital value
2320560	2322120	or any other way.
2322120	2323600	And there are these two things.
2323600	2326120	Legally, it's incredibly easy.
2326120	2327520	At the same time, digital values
2327520	2329240	are easy to falsify,
2329240	2331480	making them much more insecure.
2331480	2332600	This is the reason for the fact
2332600	2333440	that being ineffective
2333440	2335120	is the enemy of inclusion,
2335120	2336320	because inclusion is required
2336320	2338360	to be included in your control.
2338360	2339360	It's the reason for the fact
2339360	2340880	that you are so anonymous.
2340880	2341880	It's the reason for the fact
2341880	2343760	that you are an anonymous animal
2343760	2345200	and it's the reason for the fact
2345200	2347000	that in the year 2017,
2347000	2348280	the curse of Mastercard
2348280	2349720	started to happen.
2349760	2351320	It's time to promote inclusivity
2351320	2352440	to achieve the goals
2352440	2354120	that are required in inclusivity.
2354120	2355760	The priorities are inclusivity
2355760	2357400	that makes confidence.
2357400	2358760	We can't take the life
2358760	2360320	of security.
2360320	2361840	When you deliver a pet,
2361840	2363600	what is permitted?
2363600	2365760	Who is going to represent this pet
2365760	2366840	for Mastercard?
2366840	2367760	The dog.
2367760	2369080	So that's why I was the dog.
2369080	2370160	As if I was Alex Jones,
2370160	2371280	I'm the dog.
2371280	2372840	And I'm not content.
2372840	2374000	I didn't think of myself
2374000	2374920	as being a person
2374920	2377080	that prepares to be competitive.
2377080	2378360	But all the dogs are here
2378360	2379520	for what they do.
2379520	2380520	And if you're in all this
2380520	2381680	you're intrigued with pneumonia,
2381680	2383200	compare it to all the tweets,
2383200	2384680	one of the others.
2384680	2385680	Mastercard.
2385680	2386760	The corporations that can
2386760	2389000	minimize you in their social socials.
2389000	2390080	Patreon.
2390080	2391000	Mastercard.
2391000	2393280	We're not sure what we're talking about.
2393280	2394640	This culture is so much
2394640	2396520	about Sargon, Jack Ellingart
2396520	2397440	and Patreon.
2397440	2398440	And I don't think that some of the
2398440	2399400	poppies in Mastercard
2399400	2401560	are about the remotion of Sargon.
2401560	2402720	I think we are.
2402720	2403880	Patreon and Paypal
2403880	2404880	are talking about the type of
2404880	2406200	obedience that Mastercard
2406200	2407280	is talking about.
2407280	2408280	They are talking about the
2408320	2409840	rights of Mastercards
2409840	2411920	without receiving direct orders.
2411920	2412520	For now,
2412520	2413520	the evidence is concrete
2413520	2414520	that other companies
2414520	2415520	and credit targets
2415520	2416640	don't have involucrades.
2416640	2418600	I'm a bit of an extraneous person.
2418600	2420760	But, in this moment,
2420760	2422040	Mastercard has demonstrated
2422040	2423440	to be morally repugnant
2423440	2425400	in the best way possible.
2425400	2426720	Open the decisions
2426720	2428280	and the lessons of the day.
2428280	2430080	Look for the expression of expression
2430080	2432320	or the most strict immigration.
2432320	2435120	Criticize the social and feminist justice.
2435120	2436640	Contribute in any form
2436640	2438040	of political support,
2438040	2440200	nationalized or popular.
2440200	2441440	Because all of these things
2441440	2442760	that offend Mastercard
2442760	2443680	so much in ideology
2443680	2444760	like Negocius
2444760	2446880	will be the use of these gigantic structures
2446880	2448480	to try to replace them.
2448480	2450000	And we are on this.
2450000	2451520	The only reason for what we know
2451520	2452640	is that all of this
2452640	2454440	is the same as in Gamergate.
2454440	2455840	A significant and significant point
2455840	2457600	connected to people more importantly
2457600	2459600	is that they are a part of the project
2459600	2460600	and how they will be interviewed
2460600	2462040	in some cases.
2462040	2462800	Patreon,
2462800	2463640	yes,
2463640	2465720	is so significant.
2465720	2467280	But if you convert it into an internet
2467280	2468600	through which we can see
2468600	2471120	the mechanisms of the incredibly corrupt
2471120	2472800	financial industry,
2472800	2474000	you have all the experiences
2474000	2475640	that the efforts of Jordan Peterson
2475640	2477360	have created an alternative platform
2477360	2478560	that is so much more productive.
2478560	2479920	You have all the experiences
2479920	2482560	that YouTube World is preparing
2482560	2485400	to present to the Federal Commission
2485400	2486960	so that they can start an investigation
2486960	2488200	of Patreon and PayPal
2488200	2490240	in one way or another.
2490240	2491720	Can I do something
2491720	2493320	that can actually make a difference here
2493320	2494480	beyond the protest,
2494520	2495840	beyond the speaking about it,
2495840	2497120	beyond the explanation?
2497120	2499120	And until somebody else picks up the mantle,
2499120	2501200	I figure I'm in a unique position
2501200	2502440	to actually do something here
2502440	2503560	because I'm an attorney.
2503560	2504520	Now I know that some people
2504520	2505480	are trying to work
2505480	2507840	on potential alternative platforms
2507840	2509560	and alternative payment processing
2509560	2511320	and I think that's great,
2511320	2513880	but I think that we need to try to do our best
2513880	2515360	to actually stop the practice.
2515360	2517000	So I decided to file a complaint
2517000	2518240	with the Federal Trade Commission
2518240	2520160	against Patreon and PayPal
2520160	2521360	for collusion.
2521360	2523800	Now this is frankly a massive undertaking
2523800	2525920	so I basically want to tell you my story,
2525920	2528040	why I decided it and what I'm going to do
2528040	2530320	and what it would take to actually succeed
2530320	2532880	because frankly, I need your help on this.
2532880	2535320	I have all the experiences that Jack Conte,
2535320	2536840	CEO of Patreon,
2536840	2538440	wants to make an appeal
2538440	2542440	and to know the truth about all of us.
2542440	2544160	Because frankly,
2544160	2546920	Jack, your company is the arena.
2546920	2548040	And if you're going to fund it,
2548040	2549760	the best fund is to send the money
2549760	2551560	and to open it in the next year,
2551560	2554040	but I'm saying that you have to pay the bills.
2554040	2555640	We have to pay the bills,
2555640	2557160	if you're going to do that.
2557160	2558520	But before that,
2558520	2559400	the only reason why
2559400	2562480	your financial platform is not functioning
2562480	2564080	is because you can't find a bank
2564080	2565800	to process your payments.
2565800	2569440	It's possible that this is a very difficult problem
2569440	2571480	from what we've imagined in principle.
2571480	2573120	Many things that simply mean that
2573120	2574960	Patreon has paid for Jack and Jack
2574960	2577080	to buy our appropriate platform,
2577080	2578400	or what it is.
2578400	2580080	But I also think that we are in a situation
2580080	2581680	where we have to pay the bills.
2581680	2583360	More money can be made,
2583360	2585680	but the more that my money is spent,
2585680	2587840	it's better than what we're asking.
2587840	2588920	At the same time,
2588920	2590640	the next piece that we're going to talk about
2590640	2592200	in the Internet of Patreon
2592200	2593360	is the mechanism for which
2593360	2594960	most of it is Hitler's transformation.
2594960	2597200	The controversial one is extremist.
2597200	2600120	Its provocateur is expanded and transformed.
2600120	2602560	And the human being is inspired by terrorism
2602560	2604080	or Nazi philosophy.
2604080	2605040	Basically,
2605040	2606480	the forms of these people
2606480	2608000	transform into expression
2608000	2611600	in ways to justify the sense of personalization.
2611600	2613040	This, if said,
2613040	2614560	is the reason why all of the media's
2614560	2616120	communication methods
2616120	2618200	have emphasized the capacity of Sargon
2618200	2620560	and others to inspire act of violence.
2620560	2623200	Don't commit act of violence to each other
2623200	2624640	but to inspire others.
2624640	2626880	This is the reason why the majority of media
2626880	2628080	use terms like
2628080	2629760	adjacent to the right
2629760	2632040	or the right of the extreme.
2632040	2633440	Because they guarantee that someone,
2633440	2634520	in some way,
2634520	2636320	will be in the mastercard
2636320	2639360	or in the exterior of the sector
2639360	2641240	and they will be able to utilize
2641240	2643320	anti-terrorism methods
2643320	2644680	such as the measures of security
2644680	2646560	of the great informatics companies
2646560	2649120	to make the most simple of the political decisions
2649120	2651200	as if it were the catalogued
2651200	2652640	discourse of the audience.
2652640	2655040	Using the excuse of the inspiration.
2655040	2657480	Because of Trump or Brexit,
2657480	2658640	this is the signifier
2658640	2661120	of the rise in the coming of the US
2661120	2663280	to consolidate digital identity.
2663280	2664720	And all of this, because of this,
2664720	2667040	has been said a lot on the internet.
2667040	2669520	There are several books about this video.
2669520	2671480	There is a correction that no one
2671480	2673720	has read online during the time of the war.
2673720	2675200	There are also several books about
2675200	2676360	all of the world,
2676360	2678240	in all social rights.
2678240	2679280	I'll tell you.
2679280	2680040	Generally,
2680040	2681840	there are no types of things.
2681840	2683040	But it is well known
2683040	2684680	in the Greek literature.
2684680	2686360	If you have connections with a member
2686360	2687800	of the intellectual rights race
2687800	2689960	like Jordan Peterson or Derek Rubin,
2689960	2691960	or even people with no politics
2691960	2693840	like PewDiePie or Encea,
2693840	2695720	you can download this video.
2695720	2697800	You can also download the books.
2697800	2699560	I'm not interested in receiving the credit.
2699560	2702400	But it is important that we are not in the creative realm.
2702400	2705200	And I don't think that this is a Patreon or PayPal.
2705200	2707600	I would like to thank Monro and YouTube for their
2707600	2710720	contributions to form a big part of this video.
2710720	2712280	Simply by doing what I do,
2712280	2714600	there is a version that you can watch.
2714600	2715920	I don't want to be surprised,
2715920	2717600	but I would like to mention on Twitter
2717600	2719320	to make a free book for you.
2719320	2720360	If you want to know about me
2720360	2721240	and my projects,
2721240	2724120	you can find a link to it in the description below.
2724120	2726240	Today, Game Boomer Show.
2726240	2728240	I talk regularly about these things.
2728240	2731240	If you want to watch my tracks financially,
2731240	2732000	well,
2732000	2734280	this is a bit complicated, right?
2734280	2737920	But I can make a few videos on PayPal.com
2737920	2740240	via Short Photo Taco.
2740240	2741320	Or maybe on Twitch,
2741320	2743240	on Twitch.tv
2743240	2744920	via Game Boomers.
2744920	2746160	You have to check out my Patreon
2746160	2748800	because it is only necessary.
2748800	2752000	But I can't recommend it with a drink.
2752000	2753520	And to do this,
2753520	2756000	I will just put it in the description below.
2756000	2757480	And...
2757480	2759120	If you want me to not be able to
2759120	2761240	make a big part of this video in time,
2761240	2764240	and not simply to relish my videos with my friends,
2764240	2765880	go to this Twitch page.
2765880	2767760	I will continue all of the days of the week
2767760	2768880	till the end.
2768880	2769720	I hope to see you.
