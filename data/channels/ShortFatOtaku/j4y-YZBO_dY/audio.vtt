Music

00:05.960 --> 00:12.480
In my video about Team Squirrel, I told you that this information is important, so let's get to the second story.

00:12.480 --> 00:17.800
First, when I told you that Team Squirrel was the public force because of the platform,

00:17.800 --> 00:23.000
and immediately because they were involucred, and that Paypal and Stripe were going to make a Subscribestar,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.600
I didn't include the capture of those pants.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.200
So, let's look at some of these.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.840
Look at this picture of this.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.280
Well, when I told you that Team Squirrel was the public force because of the platform,

00:32.280 --> 00:34.840
one of the people I invited to regularize their work,

00:34.840 --> 00:37.720
was sexually abused by various members of the committee.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.440
Team Squirrel had this three years ago,

00:40.440 --> 00:43.760
only because the information was filtered by other people.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.480
This was due to the lack of respect for the use of the platform.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.680
During my time as the president of Team Squirrel,

00:50.680 --> 00:52.160
I was also the director of the network.

00:52.160 --> 00:57.160
A few years ago, I was on Twitter and frequently invited to talk to members of the committee.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.640
Informally, I told them that I would not be able to invite them.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.440
I was not sure that it would be encrypted by a member of the committee,

01:02.440 --> 01:05.920
and that the members of the committee would be involved in the situation.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.160
Finally, the Subscribestar was sent.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.560
I was able to talk to these people,

01:09.560 --> 01:16.800
and they could help me to ensure that this person was completely exiled from the Cambridge Center.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.480
I was not exonerated, and they were fired.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.040
I was scared that other people would be replaced.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.000
And that was all possible, because of the use of the platform.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.680
When I was young, I was scared that other people would not be able to have access to the status.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.240
I could not name the person in question because of the use of the platform.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.600
It was a problem that regularly existed in academic work.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.480
I used to be able to do it.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.200
I had no idea.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.760
I could not do other things that would have helped me to make a future.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.600
I was going to do it, but I was going to do it better.

01:48.600 --> 01:55.480
How many people would say that when Milo and I would not be able to explain to them what had happened in Hollywood,

01:55.480 --> 01:58.800
despite the lack of information about the members of the committee.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.520
Some people attacked one of the subjects, which was Welton,

02:01.520 --> 02:05.560
because he was my brother, and presented the same thing to me.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.920
You know, I lived in Hollywood a while ago.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.360
Did you? Did you go to one of his parties?

02:10.360 --> 02:15.160
I went to other people who I won't name, of a similar stature in Hollywood.

02:15.160 --> 02:20.680
I went to their boat parties and to their house parties and things, and some of the things I have seen have beggared belief.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.320
Yeah? Can you give us like a...

02:23.320 --> 02:28.200
Well, just, I can't, I don't want to be indiscreet about specific people.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.040
Right, you don't have to do that. Just dance around the facts.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.040
Yeah, dangerous, but I can tell you the truth without dropping anyone in it.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.080
I mean, some of the boys there were very young.

02:37.080 --> 02:37.680
Very young.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.800
And this is really recently?

02:38.800 --> 02:41.400
I don't remember, no, no, like, I don't know, eight years ago.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.480
I don't remember...

02:42.480 --> 02:44.080
Stactional limitations.

02:45.080 --> 02:51.640
I don't remember whether I ever met Brian Singer or whether I even knew who he was then.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.480
But I knew other people of similar stature, as I say, and there were some very young boys around at that time.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.320
There was a lot of drugs, and a lot of...

02:58.320 --> 02:59.280
Twinks.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.400
A lot of twinks, taking drugs and having unsafe sex with older men, and some of these boys were very young.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.880
But the most fascinating result is when people of my age want to progress,

03:06.880 --> 03:08.720
and they are left with a lot of bad things.

03:08.720 --> 03:13.400
And they have to ask if they are going to sacrifice themselves in the number of poor people,

03:13.400 --> 03:15.600
or if they are going to be burdened by the virus,

03:15.600 --> 03:18.800
because they are simply too important for the cause.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.320
For those of you who are watching this last group, of those who are sleeping giants,

03:23.320 --> 03:26.120
I'm sure you've seen it in a video on that.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.520
But well, it's not sufficient, this is Rodolfo Rancida.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.480
The Patreon page is still constant in my last video.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.800
I wanted to share some important points between more and more people.

03:34.800 --> 03:40.720
Many creators, like me, went to the platform where they were able to buy their own terms of service,

03:40.720 --> 03:44.840
and the word of the company's name, to try to find a good way to do it.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.480
But it seems that Patreon has entered a bit of a panic.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.560
In the department, I'm sure of my confidence.

03:49.560 --> 03:55.720
In the case of Jacqueline Hart, one of my stories has extended my view of the socialistic republic of Patreon,

03:55.720 --> 03:58.800
and I think it's not only about you, it's about Matt Christensen.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.680
One of my recapitulations.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.320
Jacqueline Hart wanted to be a cooperative family.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.280
She has experience in taxes and finances,

04:05.280 --> 04:08.480
but she wanted to be a part of her time in conferences about women,

04:08.480 --> 04:11.160
about diversity, and things like that.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.120
The main thing is the audience.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.560
One of them is Luana Vandonado,

04:15.560 --> 04:19.360
from Patreon's Patreon page,

04:19.360 --> 04:24.640
who told me directly about the topic and told me about all the information needed.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.240
Our experience with each creator is individual,

04:27.240 --> 04:30.960
and I'd like to talk about what I can do to help our audience.

04:30.960 --> 04:35.320
More specifically, I'd like to thank the audience for their experience with Patreon and their support,

04:35.320 --> 04:37.880
and what they've done in the work that they do.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.080
Now, remember this message that I didn't do for Nade.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.600
This Patreon is trying to secure their own stories,

04:43.600 --> 04:47.960
and the description of it is for an exclusive discussion about the rules and the causes of one of them.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.400
And I'm sure you'll be able to tell me that the idea of what depends is secure with you.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.040
You can share it with others.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.240
Well, this message that I gave on the phone at the end of December

04:57.240 --> 04:59.480
between Matt Christiansen and Jacqueline Hart.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.240
I'm going to leave the description on the table.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.560
And if you want to see the video I'm going to share with you,

05:03.560 --> 05:05.400
I'm going to share it with you.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.920
It's very good news for the people of Mujar,

05:07.920 --> 05:11.280
but I'd like to introduce what I believe are two integral points.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.320
Matt and Jacqueline are good news in a principle

05:13.320 --> 05:14.920
for the expression of expression,

05:14.920 --> 05:17.320
and because people are going under the platform.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.640
The one I'm going to tell you about is Jacqueline.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.640
The problem is that Patreon is so bad,

05:22.640 --> 05:24.840
and I believe that we can get to the first point

05:24.840 --> 05:27.160
and there are other things that we need to consider.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.920
First, our financial transition to the graduation class.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.320
To be able to complete our transition,

05:32.320 --> 05:34.520
we have created a community of graders

05:34.520 --> 05:37.240
who are so much like us in the platform.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.120
If we wanted to make some expressions,

05:39.120 --> 05:42.040
which are some expressions of expression,

05:42.040 --> 05:44.400
then it's only the graders that use Patreon

05:44.400 --> 05:46.840
that don't have any problems with these decorative forms,

05:46.840 --> 05:49.040
they are the ones who use the platform,

05:49.040 --> 05:50.640
and our transition is very bad.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.360
But, besides, as a platformer in Brazil,

05:54.360 --> 05:57.480
processing pages is one of our nuclear values.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.240
And we depend on the processing of pages

06:00.240 --> 06:01.480
that have the appropriate rules

06:01.480 --> 06:04.440
on what you are going to be processing, and what not.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.960
Matt, I was thinking that this Patreon decision

06:07.960 --> 06:10.280
would be something that the president wouldn't do.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.280
Jacqueline, no.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.760
This was entirely a decision by Patreon.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.000
Matt, well, I'm not sure why you're passing the card

06:18.000 --> 06:19.040
over there, Matt.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.360
Jacqueline, no, I'm not passing the card over there.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.600
We have some linear terms.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.200
I'm trying to explain that, number one,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.120
our transition is financed by the graders,

06:29.120 --> 06:33.080
and that, obviously, some people don't want to be associated.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.560
Matt, well, if it's a mission,

06:35.560 --> 06:39.000
then the processing of pages is irrelevant.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.200
It's a mission.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.920
That's what I'm talking about.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.520
Jacqueline, we're not using the card.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.320
We don't have the rules.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.600
That's what I'm saying.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.640
There's a track on all of this.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.120
There's also a contradiction.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.280
For the fact that the decision to share the card

06:54.280 --> 06:56.400
with you is completely a Patreon,

06:56.400 --> 06:57.680
but by the way,

06:57.680 --> 06:59.880
there are no visas and Mastercards,

06:59.880 --> 07:01.920
and they are not what are the rules.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.880
So we have three possibilities.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.320
One, this Patreon decision

07:06.320 --> 07:08.280
always has extreme forces,

07:08.280 --> 07:11.520
with which a boycott of the social areas is justified.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.720
Two, visa and Mastercard are forcing a Patreon on this,

07:15.720 --> 07:16.720
and it's a bit of both

07:16.720 --> 07:19.880
that companies have an interest in Sargon.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.920
Or three, that a company has an ideological line,

07:23.920 --> 07:26.160
and that it's a thing.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.800
There's a demand for a ride,

07:27.800 --> 07:30.600
and with what Patreon is doing internally,

07:30.600 --> 07:32.760
I think it's a big problem.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.160
We have a second point

07:34.160 --> 07:36.680
that I want to share with the three Christians in my heart,

07:36.680 --> 07:39.000
the inerrant success that Patreon has adopted

07:39.000 --> 07:40.920
as part of their solutions.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.960
Jacqueline, the second one is that we have a reason

07:43.960 --> 07:46.680
that we are observing all of your work and determining

07:46.680 --> 07:49.120
if this is something that is multiplexed.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.640
We have to see these things as your work,

07:51.640 --> 07:53.520
and as good as possible.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.400
Matt, are you saying that you are an individual?

07:57.400 --> 07:58.480
Jacqueline?

07:58.480 --> 07:59.600
Yes.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.760
Matt, how is it possible that you are a standard?

08:02.760 --> 08:05.720
Don't you want to be a platform for everything?

08:05.720 --> 08:09.160
Jacqueline, this is a very good question.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.640
And yes, I would like to see a platform for everything,

08:12.720 --> 08:14.200
but as you can imagine,

08:14.200 --> 08:16.640
it's very difficult to do it manually.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.360
And it's very clear that we want to see this direction,

08:19.360 --> 08:21.120
because I think it's a human element.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.400
Today, we have humans that resonate with us

08:23.400 --> 08:25.120
and contact us with creators,

08:25.120 --> 08:27.160
and for that reason, they resonate with us.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.720
But we want this to be a platform

08:29.720 --> 08:33.000
that can be used as a platform for three private products.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.400
We want these to be analytic.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.880
Matt, are you saying that you are an individual?

08:40.880 --> 08:41.600
Jacqueline?

08:41.600 --> 08:42.480
Yes.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.760
I understand.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.040
Matt?

08:45.040 --> 08:46.240
Okay.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.840
I understand that you are someone who is creators like me,

08:48.840 --> 08:52.640
and to all the people who are confused about your platform,

08:52.640 --> 08:54.240
Jacqueline.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.160
What we are trying to do is to have the most possible tools

08:58.160 --> 08:59.720
to be able to be transparent

08:59.720 --> 09:01.800
and consider all the points of view.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.880
We want to ensure that we are not operating on a camera.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.120
We don't want to have a process

09:06.120 --> 09:08.200
where we consider different opinions

09:08.200 --> 09:10.280
when we are creators.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.440
This is my point about this,

09:11.440 --> 09:15.120
but I am partially concerned with Jacqueline's report.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.760
We want the concept of the spirit of the letter of the law.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.200
The exception to the law,

09:20.200 --> 09:22.240
but one of the exceptions exists,

09:22.240 --> 09:23.880
and many of these can be necessary

09:23.880 --> 09:26.800
that the law and the laws are in crisis,

09:26.800 --> 09:29.000
so we can live with extraordinary circumstances

09:29.000 --> 09:31.800
that were not thought about.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.800
From this point of view,

09:32.800 --> 09:35.360
not only do you understand and know that it is preferable

09:35.360 --> 09:38.360
that the law is used by human beings.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.600
For example, the biggest problem with YouTube

09:40.600 --> 09:43.400
is that it is essentially this subjective choice.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.200
Since the copyright laws are proposed for both,

09:46.200 --> 09:49.640
they don't have any context or use for them.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.120
Although I don't think I have any experience in this area,

09:53.120 --> 09:55.400
but I find that people who want to do things,

09:55.400 --> 09:56.840
subjective and just,

09:56.840 --> 09:59.240
are one of the biggest problems in the system.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.480
There are people from all over the world,

10:01.480 --> 10:03.880
and they are looking at everything, case by case.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.560
If you look at this from a dialogical perspective,

10:06.560 --> 10:09.000
you can completely understand the context

10:09.000 --> 10:10.800
of the law and the law,

10:10.800 --> 10:13.600
so the things that exist are good.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.480
But that is not what they are saying.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.280
I think it is subjective that they want to try something

10:18.280 --> 10:19.840
that is much more tyrannical

10:19.840 --> 10:22.760
than an automatically automated option.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.800
And the comments from Jacqueline from my channel,

10:24.800 --> 10:26.560
that the subjective system of Patreon

10:26.560 --> 10:28.800
doesn't only try to try something in any form,

10:28.800 --> 10:29.960
if not from each,

10:29.960 --> 10:31.200
if it's an ideology.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.160
Jacqueline.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.920
Otherwise, this is the case by case.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.080
Every creator has the opportunity to talk.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.280
I want this to be completely clear.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.240
Every time we talk about Algen,

10:41.240 --> 10:43.680
this person has the opportunity to talk.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.680
That was true when I was a child, for example,

10:46.680 --> 10:48.880
but the time with the public opinion,

10:48.880 --> 10:50.400
which expressed respect for the group

10:50.400 --> 10:51.720
with which they were associated

10:51.720 --> 10:53.480
and which we cancelled out,

10:53.480 --> 10:55.440
had to come from the creator's side.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.800
So, if you see what I'm saying,

10:57.800 --> 10:58.680
I think there are a lot of people

10:58.680 --> 11:01.760
who don't believe that this is going to happen.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.240
Matt.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.720
Okay, so it's a very subjective choice

11:05.720 --> 11:08.960
if the reputability was sufficiently good.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.880
Jacqueline.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.000
Basically, you can shoot different groups on Patreon,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.760
but if a creator is there

11:14.760 --> 11:16.800
or actively opposed to these groups,

11:16.800 --> 11:19.800
then it's not going to be permitted on the platform.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.080
Matt.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.720
I'm going to go, and I'm going to go.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.000
Decho has his photography on me.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.920
This is a form of a person who is pro-crypto

11:28.920 --> 11:31.240
who can pro-crypto me for his association.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.280
I'm going to go now, I'm going to go.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.000
I think I'm going to go.

11:35.000 --> 11:35.840
Jacqueline.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.440
No, for some reason I can't.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.480
The time is when my respect for the group

11:39.480 --> 11:41.400
doesn't have anything to do with this.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.920
But the time is not with the group

11:43.920 --> 11:44.760
that they are associated with.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.720
It's more about the group that they are associated with.

11:46.720 --> 11:47.760
Matt.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.640
Well, I'm going to go,

11:49.640 --> 11:51.200
and I'm going to go on Patreon.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.080
Why don't you do a similar session?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.360
Jacqueline.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.800
To the group, it's not the same

11:56.800 --> 12:00.080
that I'm talking about on the other side.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.160
Matt.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.400
What is it that made you want to be on the other side

12:03.400 --> 12:05.640
of this network?

12:05.640 --> 12:06.560
Jacqueline.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.520
I don't want to talk about specific things.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.200
Really, Matt.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.360
Why don't you send me a mail

12:12.360 --> 12:14.880
that references a specific case?

12:14.880 --> 12:16.520
The network is called Charla.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.240
It's the one that I wrote.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.080
In the New York Times article,

12:20.080 --> 12:22.760
Patreon excluded anti-feminists for racist discourse,

12:22.760 --> 12:24.240
indicating a result.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.200
It is possible that,

12:25.200 --> 12:26.960
given the political views of Patreon,

12:26.960 --> 12:28.040
the company has been contacted

12:28.040 --> 12:29.440
with the interview and the question,

12:29.440 --> 12:31.080
and they have made specific plans.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.240
They have included in the world the material

12:33.240 --> 12:34.440
that has led to politics

12:34.440 --> 12:36.400
and has made a public discourse.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.280
I would like to say that

12:38.280 --> 12:39.440
we have been in the hands of the creators

12:39.440 --> 12:40.400
and we have worked with them

12:40.400 --> 12:42.360
in a way of one to one.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.520
And yet, all the creators are reformers.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.000
So, it's a very exciting process.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.480
Sargon has not responded to the platform of Patreon.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.520
Patreon has not seen its creators as clients.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.680
They seem like children who are vigilant

12:55.680 --> 12:57.800
and, when they cross the line,

12:57.800 --> 12:59.240
uneducated.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.240
Or, in their own words,

13:01.240 --> 13:02.440
they are made of the man.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.440
Even human beings with the same respect

13:04.440 --> 13:07.560
participate involuntarily in the process of reform,

13:07.560 --> 13:09.200
with the question of principles.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.440
Patreon is a company of tyranos,

13:11.440 --> 13:13.360
where the most important thing is to reduce,

13:13.360 --> 13:14.560
especially in the news,

13:14.560 --> 13:15.800
to admit that you are a victim

13:15.800 --> 13:17.320
and to ask for your pardon.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.160
That is not to create a negative relationship,

13:19.160 --> 13:21.280
to create a relationship between your guests.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.200
During all times,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.760
it is the principle of the sake of Patreon's support,

13:24.760 --> 13:27.640
but it is also that the heart is at the center of everything.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.760
In the next episode, we are going to talk about what this is all about.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.160
First, let's see how the time has passed,

13:33.160 --> 13:34.680
because if you are a young person

13:34.680 --> 13:35.760
at this event,

13:35.760 --> 13:37.880
and you want to know what happens the next time,

13:37.880 --> 13:40.280
we will see Jacqueline's career in LinkedIn,

13:40.280 --> 13:41.920
the one that she has been working on.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.240
My question would be,

13:43.240 --> 13:46.240
what is the most that she is trying to solve?

13:46.240 --> 13:48.680
And here is a time limit for you to consider.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.960
The 30th of October 2008,

13:50.960 --> 13:52.200
Patreon has been an event

13:52.200 --> 13:54.560
based on the recent administration for workers.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.360
Jacqueline has been at this conference

13:56.360 --> 13:57.360
for a long time,

13:57.360 --> 14:00.200
and during that time,

14:00.200 --> 14:02.160
she has been working on the recent administration

14:02.160 --> 14:04.200
of her colleagues at PayPal.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.760
The 30th of April in Patreon

14:05.760 --> 14:07.880
is much more than ideal.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.600
The present of PayPal,

14:09.600 --> 14:10.840
David Marcus,

14:10.840 --> 14:13.240
has invited Patreon to show their support.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.640
Another significant member of Patreon

14:15.640 --> 14:17.200
is Thrive Capital,

14:17.200 --> 14:20.080
which is also an important member of Thrive.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.400
And, as a part of the group,

14:22.400 --> 14:23.720
Joshua Kushner,

14:23.720 --> 14:25.440
Raman of Jared Kushner,

14:25.440 --> 14:27.040
Nueva de Nueva del Tramp,

14:27.040 --> 14:29.720
is also the founder of Thrive Capital.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.360
Despite the great separation of Tramp,

14:31.360 --> 14:32.920
I have no idea what the Emperor told us

14:32.920 --> 14:34.480
when he pushed us to do it.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.640
It's a bargain.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.280
The final result of Sleeping Giants

14:37.280 --> 14:38.560
has also been attacked by Thrive

14:38.560 --> 14:39.600
two months ago,

14:39.600 --> 14:40.880
during the attack in Aqaba.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.400
I don't know about the attention,

14:42.400 --> 14:43.960
but Thrive has been so happy

14:43.960 --> 14:46.400
to be able to support the subscription service

14:46.400 --> 14:47.600
that Team Squirrel

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
has also invited a potential

14:48.600 --> 14:49.840
for Sleeping Giants.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.160
We are extremely happy when Thrive

14:51.160 --> 14:53.000
has been able to,

14:53.000 --> 15:23.000
to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to

15:23.000 --> 15:53.000
be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be

15:53.000 --> 15:55.160
to remove Sargon's financing.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.840
It's possible that the Twitch account doesn't benefit from that.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.960
But Team Squirrel and platform hate

15:59.960 --> 16:03.760
don't know how to deal with connections as important as Senna's,

16:03.760 --> 16:05.520
the one that makes things happen.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.760
And you have to remember Jacqueline's admission

16:07.760 --> 16:10.680
that Patreon doesn't monitor her service,

16:10.680 --> 16:13.360
and that she has to report to her users.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.800
The Twitch account can do everything it needs to do for Senna's team.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.440
And in that moment,

16:18.440 --> 16:22.080
all that Patreon needs is one that can be used against her.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.920
And of course, Chazaben,

16:23.920 --> 16:25.480
who wants to go there

16:25.480 --> 16:27.320
to be able to make a reason.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.200
All that's needed is an excuse to use it.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.320
It's not a definitive pro,

16:32.320 --> 16:35.520
but for me, at least, it's how it is.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.520
If this is the project that Patreon is using as a game market,

16:38.520 --> 16:40.000
it's going to be new.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.040
The game market music is too.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.800
Where the monumental market of a very corrupt game

16:44.800 --> 16:46.720
exposes the corruption of the industry

16:46.720 --> 16:48.720
and tracks different people

16:48.720 --> 16:50.160
against different threats,

16:50.160 --> 16:51.400
controlling narratives,

16:51.400 --> 16:54.280
and removing people from incorrect politics.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.760
I think this is a very pertinent description,

16:56.760 --> 16:58.360
because, as I said earlier,

16:58.360 --> 17:01.760
the part of our new queen and the team that we have,

17:01.760 --> 17:04.120
at the end of the game, is much more evident.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.520
And that's why Patreon can be a very big part of it.

17:07.520 --> 17:11.000
Jacqueline said that the decision to remove her service with Patreon

17:11.000 --> 17:13.160
is not a visa, it's a mattercard.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.880
It can't simply be a real one.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.120
The mattercard is used to do things like this.

17:19.120 --> 17:21.480
David Horowitz said that his Freedom Foundation

17:21.480 --> 17:23.680
should remove the services of visa and mattercard

17:23.680 --> 17:25.680
from the SSPL.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.520
He declared that it was only a group of people.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.960
A visa that could communicate that it was not an involuntary one.

17:31.960 --> 17:35.280
SubscribeStar was invited by all the paid processors.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.600
PayPal was a pioneer, Stripe,

17:37.600 --> 17:40.440
including Ambas, Visa, and Mattercard.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.800
In the meantime, Mastercard recorded all the services in the 2010s.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.760
Here are the questions.

17:45.760 --> 17:50.960
The companies that are trying to convert in the new decade

17:50.960 --> 17:56.560
are going to do this, and they're not going to select what is good and what is bad.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.960
In the 2000s, at WikiLeaks, Visa and Mattercard also created their services,

18:00.960 --> 18:02.760
similar to Megablot.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.480
And, as I said, WikiLeaks was already being invented,

18:06.480 --> 18:09.000
Mattercard was used to remove the services.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.920
In the past, it was the point of expanding governmental corruption.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.420
The

18:14.420 --> 18:17.680
package that they had was removed from Patreon by Mastercard.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.080
Not by PayPal, not by Visa, by Mattercard.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.920
Not only for the possibility of continuing their work,

18:23.920 --> 18:27.560
not for continuing their work with money, but for their services.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.920
For this, Mastercard, specifically, is

18:29.920 --> 18:31.760
maintaining the goal in its terms.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.920
The commitment to move is what the business

18:33.920 --> 18:38.000
of regular forms, consistent and consistent, in two motivations.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.560
The importance of inclusion and the importance of data collection.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.560
We can see that Mastercard is also the most important

18:43.560 --> 18:46.040
motivation for the success of others.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.620
In the 2000s, Mastercard started to

18:48.620 --> 18:52.560
have a lot of relationships with mechanisms to present political events.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.840
From their political and financial relations,

18:54.840 --> 18:57.120
this process did not allow attention,

18:57.120 --> 18:59.760
but it did make sense from what they said.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.160
In the 2000s, Google took data from Mastercard

19:03.160 --> 19:05.240
to show that their policies are online,

19:05.240 --> 19:07.800
and they are offline.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.440
This, of course, is not a surprise,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.280
because big companies like Informatica and

19:12.280 --> 19:15.400
Google have been associated with the data for many years.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.360
But what does it have to do with Mastercard in all of this?

19:18.360 --> 19:19.600
It has to be relevant,

19:19.600 --> 19:22.960
because it is the declaration that there are political activities in Mastercard.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.880
All political activities that Mastercard has seen in my head

19:25.880 --> 19:28.360
are based on the interests of the company,

19:28.360 --> 19:32.280
with complete and precise preferences of their official and exclusive services.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.640
The same process is repeated in their work of conduct,

19:34.640 --> 19:37.160
based on the fact that we are in the process

19:37.160 --> 19:39.920
of making the forms responsible and ethical.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.000
If Mastercard's post-oppression to PayPal,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.640
Payoneer, Stripe, or Patreon, sorry,

19:44.640 --> 19:47.880
David Horowitz, Subscribestar, or Shihatwatch,

19:47.880 --> 19:49.400
this declaration is clear,

19:49.400 --> 19:51.360
which does not promote ideological ideas,

19:51.360 --> 19:54.640
if not because they want to represent the interests of a company.

19:54.640 --> 19:58.960
But it is even more obvious that there is a special relationship between PayPal and Mastercard.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.840
Similarly, the special relationship between Patreon and PayPal,

20:01.840 --> 20:03.640
which I shared in my video earlier,

20:03.640 --> 20:05.880
can be found in the article on PayPal's target,

20:05.880 --> 20:07.360
obviously on Mastercard,

20:07.360 --> 20:09.840
on my article in 2016.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.680
Paypal and Mastercard expanded their association,

20:12.680 --> 20:14.320
to benefit consumers,

20:14.320 --> 20:16.560
investors, and financial institutions.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.880
We can now see a list of the names of the companies

20:18.880 --> 20:20.800
that made an increase on the other,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.160
like Robert Seibert,

20:22.160 --> 20:23.760
Nitin Srivastava,

20:23.760 --> 20:25.080
Liam Spence,

20:25.080 --> 20:27.240
Monica Yasuja,

20:27.240 --> 20:28.720
John Mwangi,

20:28.720 --> 20:29.760
Jesse Tran,

20:29.760 --> 20:30.920
Karen Pascoe,

20:30.920 --> 20:32.080
Attula Baig,

20:32.080 --> 20:33.360
Rasia Sultana,

20:33.360 --> 20:34.760
Beth Kitchener,

20:34.760 --> 20:35.840
Roger Griffith,

20:35.840 --> 20:37.080
Luke Olbridge,

20:37.080 --> 20:39.040
Diego Steinhandler,

20:39.040 --> 20:40.200
Adrian Collard,

20:40.200 --> 20:41.760
and Eduardo Riggi.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.080
I don't know what to say,

20:43.080 --> 20:45.520
but please do not contact these people.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.040
This is only to demonstrate how PayPal and Mastercard

20:48.040 --> 20:51.000
have one of the best methods in the world of the other.

20:51.000 --> 20:51.640
But,

20:51.640 --> 20:52.880
as we are talking about numbers,

20:52.880 --> 20:54.640
there is an interesting one.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.880
George Soros and Mastercard

20:56.880 --> 21:00.160
are there to help immigrants and refugees.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.920
If you know George Soros,

21:01.920 --> 21:04.760
people immediately tell you that he is anti-semitic,

21:04.760 --> 21:06.800
and that he is competitive.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.320
So, he is going to do everything possible to not be bullied.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.680
He is going to be the principal of the people.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.280
Obviously, he is a racist.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.320
But there are various factors that are involved.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.400
Other groups of activists in social rights,

21:18.400 --> 21:20.000
Hope Not Hate,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.720
and financial support through Open Society,

21:22.720 --> 21:24.640
and also in the form of just being part of the law

21:24.640 --> 21:26.800
and being part of the law in Southern debate,

21:26.800 --> 21:30.040
when the remover was in defense of massive immigration.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.320
So, George Soros and Mastercard are together

21:32.320 --> 21:34.560
with the time of the economic immigrants.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.360
So, what are the details in this case?

21:37.360 --> 21:38.800
Well, in this case,

21:38.800 --> 21:41.800
the plans of Mastercard and George Soros are aligned,

21:41.800 --> 21:44.960
and we have the motivation and the means to help them.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.680
We have the numbers of people annually,

21:47.680 --> 21:49.800
and since the beginning of 2015,

21:49.800 --> 21:54.280
we have started to focus on the inclusion of finance.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.640
This is a concept that we always have.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.160
We are in the six relationships that we have,

21:59.160 --> 22:02.320
with PayPal and some other interesting numbers,

22:02.320 --> 22:04.280
which are not part of this video.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.360
Visa and American Express, for example,

22:06.360 --> 22:08.400
are not part of the concept.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.360
The concept has been declared a political submission,

22:11.360 --> 22:12.520
but the main part is its members

22:12.520 --> 22:14.600
that are globalist and liberal.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.400
And the actual president of the concept, Richard Gass,

22:17.400 --> 22:19.120
is an article on the title that says

22:19.120 --> 22:21.360
that there are so many liberal people in the world.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.600
In the case of Daniel,

22:22.600 --> 22:25.200
which is a population movement in democratic countries,

22:25.200 --> 22:26.840
the cause of his global project.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.960
But it is also possible that political decisions

22:28.960 --> 22:30.840
represent the interests of Mastercard.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.400
None of the people are the people in the company.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.840
Instead of Mastercard as a corporation,

22:35.840 --> 22:37.400
to finance the market in the first place

22:37.400 --> 22:39.400
is a very big and obvious challenge.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.680
But certainly not the biggest and most important one.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.160
Many of these JWs and people who want to help

22:45.160 --> 22:46.840
to buy online Mastercard

22:46.840 --> 22:49.000
because of the group's financial aid.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.520
But the difference between Patreon

22:51.520 --> 22:53.520
is that it does not have an effect.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.840
If anything, Mastercard is a role active in politics.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.240
There is an enormous number of panel presentations

22:59.240 --> 23:02.200
and foundation opportunities for Mastercard.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.600
There are many social and intersectional issues.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.360
But there are some that are repeated throughout all of them.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.720
What I would like to share with you is digital identity.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.600
Digital identity is a function of the two motivations

23:14.600 --> 23:18.000
that we started, inclusion and data.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.280
For me, I would like to show you some examples of Mastercard

23:20.280 --> 23:22.760
based on two different things.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.800
Before we move on,

23:23.800 --> 23:27.400
let's see how this works in the digital identity concept.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.920
The recent increase in Mastercard financial aid

23:30.960 --> 23:32.920
has been the leader of infinite

23:32.920 --> 23:35.800
to think about the relationship between political and data.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.720
Some of the people who work on Amazon,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.080
Mastercard and PayPal,

23:39.080 --> 23:41.040
have also been a part of the articular relationship

23:41.040 --> 23:42.960
with inclusivity and data.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.400
The idea of Mastercard is that

23:44.400 --> 23:49.080
the data is on the new petroleum tax.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.480
The CEO, Ajay Banga,

23:51.480 --> 23:54.000
said that he considered the data as a public bank

23:54.000 --> 23:56.320
and not only as a commercial market.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.920
Multiple people with all sorts of Mastercards,

23:58.920 --> 24:00.960
including officials at FFS Inclusion,

24:00.960 --> 24:03.080
representatives of the diversity of Inclusion

24:03.080 --> 24:05.480
and other real-life cards,

24:05.480 --> 24:08.960
have been invited by Solpreza and Inclusion.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.720
In special, Inclusion Financier,

24:10.720 --> 24:13.440
which is a part of the digital identity club.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.160
In one of my first SJ Weekly

24:15.160 --> 24:17.880
I discussed an article about Inclusion Financier.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.080
To be sure,

24:19.080 --> 24:20.360
basically what I said is that

24:20.360 --> 24:23.240
the bank system considers it to be good

24:23.240 --> 24:26.280
when more people are engaged in the financial system,

24:26.280 --> 24:29.040
which is through an account or a credit account.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.520
Of course, it is good,

24:30.520 --> 24:32.120
because it signifies more clients,

24:32.120 --> 24:33.720
but it also represents a form

24:33.720 --> 24:34.960
for which people have to access

24:34.960 --> 24:36.680
a private financial system

24:36.680 --> 24:38.760
with modern global financial systems.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.360
And what makes people in the system

24:40.360 --> 24:43.160
is diversity and inclusion,

24:43.160 --> 24:45.280
because the people who have not been engaged

24:45.280 --> 24:47.640
are engaged in the digital world.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.120
This is linked with the other initiatives of Mastercard,

24:50.120 --> 24:51.480
such as the migration in Africa

24:51.480 --> 24:53.400
during the Cinclos Fin of Inversion

24:53.400 --> 24:54.880
and collapse of the region,

24:54.880 --> 24:56.600
or the red red area of Mastercard,

24:56.600 --> 24:59.120
which can achieve digital financial forms

24:59.120 --> 25:02.240
in other sectors and in political conflicts.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.440
I don't know what these things are,

25:04.440 --> 25:06.800
but I think that by looking at the third world market

25:06.800 --> 25:08.320
you can achieve this kind of form

25:08.320 --> 25:10.200
in order to pass the situation,

25:10.200 --> 25:13.600
which is more expensive than being able to finance it.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.280
But there are no chances that Mastercard

25:15.280 --> 25:18.960
is getting this out of the fund of its own existence.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.760
Remember,

25:19.760 --> 25:21.920
when Mastercard was the company that made me

25:21.920 --> 25:23.640
I could have done political work with the fund

25:23.640 --> 25:25.400
to increase its profits.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.560
Mastercard wanted to achieve

25:26.560 --> 25:29.080
the profits of millions of new clients.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.880
In 2020, I was in the business of diversity and progress,

25:31.880 --> 25:33.840
including finance.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.400
And then I became the emperor of economic immigrants,

25:36.400 --> 25:38.360
the dissolution of international jobs,

25:38.360 --> 25:40.240
positions of the extreme care of the people

25:40.240 --> 25:43.000
that enabled all the narratives of the ultra-right

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
to be sold out of the book,

25:45.000 --> 25:46.680
in its last two years.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.640
From the fourth notice of Mastercard,

25:48.640 --> 25:51.520
when new companies are increasingly more inclusive

25:51.520 --> 25:53.480
and opportunities for everyone.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.800
The integration of the 25th,

25:54.800 --> 25:56.360
as four Refugia missions,

25:56.360 --> 25:57.720
to new communities is a theme

25:57.720 --> 26:00.480
that is the result of the whole world.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.800
Ironically, the solution to Refugia,

26:02.800 --> 26:05.040
which is being adopted by a new company,

26:05.040 --> 26:08.240
is to increase the opportunity and opportunities for everyone.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.760
Mastercard is globally developed

26:09.760 --> 26:11.240
with the commitment of the United States

26:11.240 --> 26:13.640
to increase the access to essential technologies

26:13.640 --> 26:15.720
and products that advance financial education

26:15.720 --> 26:17.640
and to provide financial services

26:17.640 --> 26:20.120
to communities that are being sold out of the world.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.040
So, to answer this question,

26:22.040 --> 26:24.360
if this is the power of the great economic sector,

26:24.360 --> 26:26.040
it is to find Mastercard.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.960
And Mastercard is going to be the leader of inclusion,

26:28.960 --> 26:29.760
when in reality,

26:29.760 --> 26:32.360
everyone who wants to have access to a new market,

26:32.360 --> 26:35.280
back to the market of progress.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.400
I mean the people with the same values.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.680
The people are meant to be a member of the industry

26:40.680 --> 26:42.520
that is not able to reveal their numbers,

26:42.520 --> 26:43.880
by obvious reasons.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.800
We know what they have to say.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.320
I mean, for example,

26:47.320 --> 26:49.200
the security of the world,

26:49.200 --> 26:50.960
the security standards of the industry

26:50.960 --> 26:52.720
in the market of goods,

26:52.720 --> 26:55.000
or PCE of this.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.560
They are made by the market of goods,

26:56.560 --> 26:57.720
by the same company,

26:57.720 --> 26:59.280
without the commitment of the government

26:59.280 --> 27:00.840
and without regulations.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.440
Some states are referring to PCE of this,

27:04.440 --> 27:06.280
but only in reference to the new market.

27:06.280 --> 27:09.160
They don't want the company to comply with these standards,

27:09.160 --> 27:10.960
but they feel that it is protected

27:10.960 --> 27:12.400
by the legal responsibility

27:12.400 --> 27:14.720
in a filtration case of this.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.800
My guess is that it is a filtration.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.760
Visa and Mastercard don't want to contract

27:18.760 --> 27:21.320
a foreign PCE of PCE,

27:21.320 --> 27:23.680
which decides to pay a lot.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.920
What would happen if we didn't?

27:25.920 --> 27:28.000
We wouldn't be able to get access to Red,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.960
and we wouldn't be able to make a payment online.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.880
There is a huge interest to be able to get access to Red

27:34.880 --> 27:36.920
and to have the capital's flux.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.120
The value of everything is the number of security.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.360
Mastercard and Visa have complete control

27:42.360 --> 27:45.120
of their payments, not being effective.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.160
If you can get their interest in any form,

27:48.160 --> 27:52.120
you can use PCE of PCE to get your money.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.200
The other businesses depend on Visa and Mastercard

27:55.200 --> 27:57.440
to help them process their payments.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.880
This is a mafia.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.600
It is not a free market.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.000
It is a very big mafia

28:02.000 --> 28:04.080
that Paypal and Stripe are trying to find

28:04.080 --> 28:07.200
and subscribe to to protect the interest of Patreon.

28:07.200 --> 28:10.360
This is a mafia of the companies of the market.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.880
They have control over the financial structure of the world.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.400
I believe that the social market is being infiltrated by Mastercard.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.960
Mastercard is using its infrastructure

28:19.960 --> 28:22.840
to block people who have political differences

28:22.840 --> 28:26.280
from accessing the global market.

28:26.280 --> 28:29.160
The PCE of PCE is the agreement you can use,

28:29.160 --> 28:32.360
unilaterally, to get access to whatever you need

28:32.360 --> 28:34.440
to have a financial presence online.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.040
Remember that Jacqueline Hart has a reference to this

28:37.040 --> 28:39.160
in her book with Matt Christiansen.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.960
Processing payments depends on our ability

28:40.960 --> 28:42.680
to access the rest of the payment,

28:42.680 --> 28:44.520
and we have to be able to access it.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.880
If we are able to supply it,

28:45.880 --> 28:47.720
what do we need to access it?

28:47.720 --> 28:49.960
Well, why don't we do that?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.000
Here is a PDF of his internal job,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.600
the Mastercard deal.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.280
In his article about the hot watch,

28:55.280 --> 28:58.040
David Horowitz, Mastercard localizes

28:58.040 --> 28:59.560
both of them,

28:59.560 --> 29:02.120
to their political affiliations.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.120
But, between the Mastercard deal,

29:04.120 --> 29:07.680
the political affiliations are not considered.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.880
The consequences are

29:08.880 --> 29:10.760
that the continued adults,

29:10.760 --> 29:11.840
the pharmaceuticals,

29:11.840 --> 29:12.840
tobacco dealers,

29:12.840 --> 29:14.040
and the silver lockers,

29:14.040 --> 29:16.440
are all considered altruistic,

29:16.440 --> 29:19.160
but there is not a mention of political affiliations.

29:19.160 --> 29:22.880
And, certainly, there are other political affiliations

29:22.880 --> 29:24.760
that don't support the most sensitive.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.240
Why would Mastercard consider

29:26.240 --> 29:29.240
only one of them as altruistic?

29:29.240 --> 29:32.800
In case I want to represent an altruistic,

29:32.800 --> 29:35.280
I want to put my plans at the right place.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.920
But, well,

29:36.920 --> 29:39.400
how do we apply this in real life?

29:39.400 --> 29:42.320
Because this is only going to appear on Twitter.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.560
I know that Twitter is going to be a personal account,

29:44.560 --> 29:47.840
as well as the president of Mastercard.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.160
And, of course.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.880
Innovation, diversity, inclusion, support.

29:52.880 --> 29:53.960
And, Twitter.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.640
If you want to talk about the global conference

29:55.640 --> 29:57.760
of the people of Bocconi, it's there.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.880
The account of Mastercard

29:58.880 --> 30:00.680
is the one that I was supposed to respond to.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.520
The private and public associates

30:02.520 --> 30:05.080
were influenced by the economic crisis and innovation.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.000
But, we have to be careful

30:06.000 --> 30:08.560
to apply it to the real world and to the real world.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.400
We need to know how to adapt to global standards

30:11.400 --> 30:13.240
and to be able to produce local barriers

30:13.240 --> 30:14.840
to the global innovation.

30:14.840 --> 30:15.840
And in this event,

30:15.840 --> 30:19.360
in 2015, I want you to know what I'm talking about.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.160
Great discussions on the competition.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.320
But, more standards are more important.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.360
We are talking about the country being the source.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.400
If you want to enter the line for all,

30:27.400 --> 30:28.720
the idea is the same.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.640
Nationalized movements

30:30.640 --> 30:32.720
that bring global plans to Mastercard

30:32.720 --> 30:36.320
are considered local barriers to be crucial.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.160
Mastercard has to be able to get to the real world

30:39.160 --> 30:41.480
and make sure that it's not autonomous.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.720
So, if these are the rules,

30:43.720 --> 30:45.960
what is the plan at the workplace?

30:45.960 --> 30:47.400
Let's talk about two questions.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.400
What is a clear example of the person

30:49.400 --> 30:51.600
who is talking about all of this time?

30:51.600 --> 30:54.320
There is one inclusivity of two.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.760
Another is financially, for example,

30:56.760 --> 30:57.920
and digital.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.960
The corporation can be used in social terms.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.720
In Mastercard, we are considering a sustainable model

31:04.720 --> 31:06.880
that allows us to do good things.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.680
I don't understand that they also have

31:08.680 --> 31:10.480
the right to say no

31:10.480 --> 31:12.640
to the government of the country.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.160
They also come together as a country

31:14.160 --> 31:15.440
with the appropriate conditions

31:15.440 --> 31:17.280
to make a relationship between

31:17.280 --> 31:18.840
the marketplace of Mastercard.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.680
By declaring that the sophisticated consumers

31:20.680 --> 31:23.200
with the smartphone have been ineffective.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.640
This has been so good for the economic market

31:25.640 --> 31:28.200
that it has not been used for the global economic system,

31:28.200 --> 31:31.280
that it has not been used financially.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.440
And yes,

31:32.440 --> 31:34.080
there has been some of this.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.480
In the art of Markle,

31:35.480 --> 31:37.160
Ant and Poco are very happy to see that

31:37.160 --> 31:38.760
they have succeeded in doing so.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.480
They are also very happy with the economic market

31:41.480 --> 31:43.880
for which they have been financially funded.

31:43.880 --> 31:46.200
Ant also thinks that the diversity of inclusion

31:46.200 --> 31:48.240
should be increased in all the levels

31:48.240 --> 31:49.840
of the operation of the company,

31:49.840 --> 31:51.280
from the services and products,

31:51.280 --> 31:53.240
to the essential properties of universities

31:53.240 --> 31:54.960
for their employees.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.080
And if you look at one of the things

31:56.080 --> 31:59.080
that is the famous model of Mastercard's Mastercard,

31:59.080 --> 32:00.440
which is now released,

32:00.440 --> 32:03.120
Ant is more than willing to have a conversation with us

32:03.120 --> 32:06.080
in respect to how the monetary contribution

32:06.080 --> 32:08.040
of the companies has influenced the position

32:08.040 --> 32:10.000
of an independent market.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Every Mastercard project is about diversity of inclusion.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.960
Every one of them says things like

32:14.960 --> 32:16.840
they don't have any sense of having the internet

32:16.840 --> 32:17.880
of all the things,

32:17.880 --> 32:20.160
if they don't have the internet of all people,

32:20.160 --> 32:22.800
they are talking about things and things.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.480
Because, like Ant,

32:24.480 --> 32:25.880
Mastercard doesn't have the power

32:25.880 --> 32:28.480
to exclude anyone who wants to see

32:28.480 --> 32:31.920
some of the things they are interested in.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.560
Mastercard will have the potential

32:33.560 --> 32:34.760
of people not being characterized

32:34.760 --> 32:37.360
in the economic market of the majority.

32:37.360 --> 32:40.400
So, Chigatwatch, Imilow and Horowitz

32:40.400 --> 32:41.920
have to be excited.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.240
Mastercard will be interested in the actual mafia

32:44.240 --> 32:45.640
of technological companies,

32:45.640 --> 32:48.480
so that Gab, Bitchute and Subscribestar

32:48.480 --> 32:50.120
will have to be excited.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.040
And remember,

32:51.040 --> 32:52.120
after all,

32:52.120 --> 32:54.880
the political act of Mastercard is

32:54.880 --> 32:58.520
based only on the economic sector of the company.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.560
All of this was decided.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.960
It's easy to put tweets and articles like this

33:02.960 --> 33:04.200
and to share them with you

33:04.200 --> 33:07.240
if you want to see my content in one of your videos.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.520
See the videos on YouTube

33:08.520 --> 33:11.240
about those things that have been going on in the last years.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.320
Well,

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
if that's all what's going on in this country,

33:14.320 --> 33:16.960
then it's going to be voluntary.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.280
Because if all of this is the truth,

33:19.280 --> 33:21.560
you won't find the important part.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.640
This is digital identity.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.800
The function of inclusion and data,

33:25.800 --> 33:27.800
of political inclusion and social inclusion

33:27.800 --> 33:29.360
with financial inclusion,

33:29.360 --> 33:31.640
and what is significant to Mastercard.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.400
I won't talk about it with ideology.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.400
But let me tell you what I say.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.440
These are two tweets,

33:37.440 --> 33:39.640
very different and very different.

33:39.640 --> 33:43.160
One is about Mastercard being built on social rights,

33:43.160 --> 33:44.240
and the other is about

33:44.240 --> 33:47.520
putting an global identity on a national level.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.080
What one of those means

33:49.080 --> 33:51.560
is the digital identity concept.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.600
Here I share with you a few.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.600
Mastercard, I believe that the European Union

33:55.600 --> 33:57.840
needs a digital market.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.760
And Mastercard, I believe that Refugia

33:59.760 --> 34:02.640
needs a digital identity document.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.240
What connects these two things?

34:04.240 --> 34:06.000
Digital identity.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.680
The digital identity is the enemy of inclusion.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.440
Digital identity is digital identity for refugia.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.640
Digital identity for refugia.

34:13.640 --> 34:15.640
The real identity is the first in the year

34:15.640 --> 34:17.280
since the equality of gender.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.120
One in Africa is ineffective.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.400
Without digital identity,

34:20.400 --> 34:22.480
the demography has been destroyed.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.960
Mastercard works to integrate refugia.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.880
Efficiency is ineffective.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.760
Financial inclusion blocks social progress

34:29.760 --> 34:31.280
and economic potential.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.800
Diversity can't be something that is real.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.000
This is all digital identity.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.320
Inclusion is data.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.520
Political inclusion.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.920
Social inclusion.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.880
Financial inclusion is the same thing

34:43.880 --> 34:45.680
for Mastercard as a company.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.680
This is the reason why

34:46.680 --> 34:50.400
the refugia in the global financial system

34:50.400 --> 34:52.640
is treated with the same level of security

34:52.640 --> 34:54.240
as social justice.

34:54.240 --> 34:56.800
This is the reason why digital identity

34:56.800 --> 35:00.160
is a combination of inclusive and data.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.760
And that's why this is the strategy of Mastercard.

35:02.760 --> 35:03.760
There are so many people

35:03.760 --> 35:05.880
who are possible in the financial system.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.240
If this means supporting initiatives in Africa

35:08.240 --> 35:10.560
against philanthropy,

35:10.560 --> 35:11.680
that's fine.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.080
If this means pushing motions

35:13.080 --> 35:16.120
against the limits of refugia

35:16.120 --> 35:18.880
against social justice,

35:18.880 --> 35:20.520
that's fine.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.640
But with this global financial system

35:22.640 --> 35:25.240
and the exponential growth of its users,

35:25.240 --> 35:26.680
it's important to keep the value

35:26.680 --> 35:28.360
of equity in the equation,

35:28.360 --> 35:31.040
the progress of its growth in firms and countries.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.840
It's important to keep digital.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.360
The financial legacies are social.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.600
Hashtag, an effective social association.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.880
One way that finance

35:38.880 --> 35:41.880
and digital identity are completely digitalized

35:41.880 --> 35:44.240
is to use the protocol PES and DDS

35:44.240 --> 35:46.200
to personalize with any other person

35:46.200 --> 35:47.840
who is a pong.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.280
Ah, digitality against those immigrants on Facebook?

35:51.280 --> 35:52.840
Well, not only on Facebook,

35:52.840 --> 35:54.000
you can use it on the phone

35:54.000 --> 35:55.840
and you can't use PayPal.

35:55.840 --> 35:56.800
But your Mastercard

35:56.800 --> 35:58.800
will not be able to buy it.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.160
Your bank will process the page of the tool killer

36:01.160 --> 36:04.320
and your digital identity will be revoked.

36:04.320 --> 36:08.080
This is the way to prove that Mastercard is working.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.560
Let's see how this works.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.920
You need to excel people in society.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.240
And don't refer to people

36:13.240 --> 36:14.920
who are restaurant owners.

36:14.920 --> 36:15.880
Don't listen to people

36:15.880 --> 36:17.840
who are eating your food for what they eat.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.280
Because participants from the Twitch channels

36:20.280 --> 36:22.040
have been considered toxic.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.280
But don't be afraid.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.120
You need to know that the art department

36:25.120 --> 36:26.760
has a video tutorial template.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.600
I was just trying to rent a room

36:28.600 --> 36:30.000
in an apartment building

36:30.000 --> 36:34.160
and this ad that someone put out,

36:34.160 --> 36:35.880
they Googled me,

36:35.880 --> 36:36.720
they saw my,

36:36.720 --> 36:39.760
I'm assuming they saw my Twitter or Facebook or something

36:39.760 --> 36:41.840
and it said that I used to work at Fox.

36:41.840 --> 36:45.140
And they sent me back an email saying,

36:46.880 --> 36:48.400
like, you know, we're sorry,

36:48.400 --> 36:51.440
but we have different political views on you.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.880
We hate Fox.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.920
Good luck in your search for housing.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.480
And this was actually the second time

36:56.480 --> 36:57.480
that it happened.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.600
First time it happened actually yesterday.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.160
I met companies from the market

37:01.160 --> 37:02.920
who are using a free structure

37:02.920 --> 37:04.960
to block the company from being free

37:04.960 --> 37:06.160
and which is illegal to buy

37:06.160 --> 37:08.160
in the United States.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.800
And every time I went to one of these things,

37:09.800 --> 37:12.840
there was one idea in the social media

37:12.840 --> 37:13.760
the progressive one.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.760
The inclusive one is that these companies

37:15.760 --> 37:16.880
are active in the air,

37:16.880 --> 37:18.880
in order to understand how their politics

37:18.880 --> 37:20.640
are completely completely co-opted

37:20.640 --> 37:21.720
by the people of Negocios

37:21.720 --> 37:23.160
that are doing the art.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.080
This mentality,

37:24.080 --> 37:25.360
of which I have used to be the most

37:25.360 --> 37:26.720
minimal power that can be used

37:26.720 --> 37:29.400
by people innocent of political motives,

37:29.400 --> 37:31.000
has been in my head in society

37:31.000 --> 37:32.640
during the last few years.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.120
That being in a restaurant

37:34.120 --> 37:36.400
is a small part of a massive problem

37:36.400 --> 37:38.480
in bringing the forms that are Negocios

37:38.480 --> 37:40.080
and one with the other.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.440
When the social media started

37:41.440 --> 37:41.880
in the country,

37:41.880 --> 37:42.640
a number of television companies

37:43.520 --> 37:46.160
were only a small part of this campaign.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.040
I'm sure you will know the next one.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.360
It's guaranteed.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.520
We're going to have a lobby

37:50.520 --> 37:52.200
of more than one hundred people

37:52.200 --> 37:53.400
in the market

37:53.400 --> 37:55.560
and more than the other.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.200
It's guaranteed.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.480
That's going to be the next campaign.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.360
If you want to make a very straight line

38:01.360 --> 38:02.640
or a digital way,

38:02.640 --> 38:03.840
with a set of titles,

38:03.840 --> 38:04.680
you can make it

38:04.680 --> 38:06.800
even more intelligible.

38:06.800 --> 38:07.840
But you can't make it

38:07.840 --> 38:09.120
because you simply want to create

38:09.120 --> 38:10.160
another number of studios

38:10.160 --> 38:11.600
and a new one.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.160
This is a way to allow the other

38:13.160 --> 38:14.680
in the world to be ineffective.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.120
There is digital identity

38:16.120 --> 38:17.760
and the reaction of the social media

38:17.760 --> 38:18.760
is too much.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.720
It's an effective way

38:19.720 --> 38:20.560
to procreate value

38:20.560 --> 38:22.320
against all financial systems.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.360
You can't control the value

38:23.360 --> 38:24.680
of value if it's physically

38:24.680 --> 38:25.720
in support of you.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.440
You can't control the value of value

38:27.440 --> 38:30.000
if it's not in support of your physical value.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.400
That's why, for example,

38:31.400 --> 38:33.560
you have to trust all the levels.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.960
There are projects that you have to

38:34.960 --> 38:36.080
trigger your contract

38:36.080 --> 38:38.040
for a positive deposit.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.240
But I don't know if you want

38:39.240 --> 38:40.560
to use digital value

38:40.560 --> 38:42.120
or any other way.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.600
And there are these two things.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.120
Legally, it's incredibly easy.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.520
At the same time, digital values

38:47.520 --> 38:49.240
are easy to falsify,

38:49.240 --> 38:51.480
making them much more insecure.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.600
This is the reason for the fact

38:52.600 --> 38:53.440
that being ineffective

38:53.440 --> 38:55.120
is the enemy of inclusion,

38:55.120 --> 38:56.320
because inclusion is required

38:56.320 --> 38:58.360
to be included in your control.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.360
It's the reason for the fact

38:59.360 --> 39:00.880
that you are so anonymous.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.880
It's the reason for the fact

39:01.880 --> 39:03.760
that you are an anonymous animal

39:03.760 --> 39:05.200
and it's the reason for the fact

39:05.200 --> 39:07.000
that in the year 2017,

39:07.000 --> 39:08.280
the curse of Mastercard

39:08.280 --> 39:09.720
started to happen.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.320
It's time to promote inclusivity

39:11.320 --> 39:12.440
to achieve the goals

39:12.440 --> 39:14.120
that are required in inclusivity.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.760
The priorities are inclusivity

39:15.760 --> 39:17.400
that makes confidence.

39:17.400 --> 39:18.760
We can't take the life

39:18.760 --> 39:20.320
of security.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.840
When you deliver a pet,

39:21.840 --> 39:23.600
what is permitted?

39:23.600 --> 39:25.760
Who is going to represent this pet

39:25.760 --> 39:26.840
for Mastercard?

39:26.840 --> 39:27.760
The dog.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.080
So that's why I was the dog.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.160
As if I was Alex Jones,

39:30.160 --> 39:31.280
I'm the dog.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.840
And I'm not content.

39:32.840 --> 39:34.000
I didn't think of myself

39:34.000 --> 39:34.920
as being a person

39:34.920 --> 39:37.080
that prepares to be competitive.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.360
But all the dogs are here

39:38.360 --> 39:39.520
for what they do.

39:39.520 --> 39:40.520
And if you're in all this

39:40.520 --> 39:41.680
you're intrigued with pneumonia,

39:41.680 --> 39:43.200
compare it to all the tweets,

39:43.200 --> 39:44.680
one of the others.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.680
Mastercard.

39:45.680 --> 39:46.760
The corporations that can

39:46.760 --> 39:49.000
minimize you in their social socials.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.080
Patreon.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.000
Mastercard.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.280
We're not sure what we're talking about.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.640
This culture is so much

39:54.640 --> 39:56.520
about Sargon, Jack Ellingart

39:56.520 --> 39:57.440
and Patreon.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.440
And I don't think that some of the

39:58.440 --> 39:59.400
poppies in Mastercard

39:59.400 --> 40:01.560
are about the remotion of Sargon.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.720
I think we are.

40:02.720 --> 40:03.880
Patreon and Paypal

40:03.880 --> 40:04.880
are talking about the type of

40:04.880 --> 40:06.200
obedience that Mastercard

40:06.200 --> 40:07.280
is talking about.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.280
They are talking about the

40:08.320 --> 40:09.840
rights of Mastercards

40:09.840 --> 40:11.920
without receiving direct orders.

40:11.920 --> 40:12.520
For now,

40:12.520 --> 40:13.520
the evidence is concrete

40:13.520 --> 40:14.520
that other companies

40:14.520 --> 40:15.520
and credit targets

40:15.520 --> 40:16.640
don't have involucrades.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.600
I'm a bit of an extraneous person.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.760
But, in this moment,

40:20.760 --> 40:22.040
Mastercard has demonstrated

40:22.040 --> 40:23.440
to be morally repugnant

40:23.440 --> 40:25.400
in the best way possible.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.720
Open the decisions

40:26.720 --> 40:28.280
and the lessons of the day.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.080
Look for the expression of expression

40:30.080 --> 40:32.320
or the most strict immigration.

40:32.320 --> 40:35.120
Criticize the social and feminist justice.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.640
Contribute in any form

40:36.640 --> 40:38.040
of political support,

40:38.040 --> 40:40.200
nationalized or popular.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.440
Because all of these things

40:41.440 --> 40:42.760
that offend Mastercard

40:42.760 --> 40:43.680
so much in ideology

40:43.680 --> 40:44.760
like Negocius

40:44.760 --> 40:46.880
will be the use of these gigantic structures

40:46.880 --> 40:48.480
to try to replace them.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.000
And we are on this.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.520
The only reason for what we know

40:51.520 --> 40:52.640
is that all of this

40:52.640 --> 40:54.440
is the same as in Gamergate.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.840
A significant and significant point

40:55.840 --> 40:57.600
connected to people more importantly

40:57.600 --> 40:59.600
is that they are a part of the project

40:59.600 --> 41:00.600
and how they will be interviewed

41:00.600 --> 41:02.040
in some cases.

41:02.040 --> 41:02.800
Patreon,

41:02.800 --> 41:03.640
yes,

41:03.640 --> 41:05.720
is so significant.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.280
But if you convert it into an internet

41:07.280 --> 41:08.600
through which we can see

41:08.600 --> 41:11.120
the mechanisms of the incredibly corrupt

41:11.120 --> 41:12.800
financial industry,

41:12.800 --> 41:14.000
you have all the experiences

41:14.000 --> 41:15.640
that the efforts of Jordan Peterson

41:15.640 --> 41:17.360
have created an alternative platform

41:17.360 --> 41:18.560
that is so much more productive.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.920
You have all the experiences

41:19.920 --> 41:22.560
that YouTube World is preparing

41:22.560 --> 41:25.400
to present to the Federal Commission

41:25.400 --> 41:26.960
so that they can start an investigation

41:26.960 --> 41:28.200
of Patreon and PayPal

41:28.200 --> 41:30.240
in one way or another.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.720
Can I do something

41:31.720 --> 41:33.320
that can actually make a difference here

41:33.320 --> 41:34.480
beyond the protest,

41:34.520 --> 41:35.840
beyond the speaking about it,

41:35.840 --> 41:37.120
beyond the explanation?

41:37.120 --> 41:39.120
And until somebody else picks up the mantle,

41:39.120 --> 41:41.200
I figure I'm in a unique position

41:41.200 --> 41:42.440
to actually do something here

41:42.440 --> 41:43.560
because I'm an attorney.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.520
Now I know that some people

41:44.520 --> 41:45.480
are trying to work

41:45.480 --> 41:47.840
on potential alternative platforms

41:47.840 --> 41:49.560
and alternative payment processing

41:49.560 --> 41:51.320
and I think that's great,

41:51.320 --> 41:53.880
but I think that we need to try to do our best

41:53.880 --> 41:55.360
to actually stop the practice.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.000
So I decided to file a complaint

41:57.000 --> 41:58.240
with the Federal Trade Commission

41:58.240 --> 42:00.160
against Patreon and PayPal

42:00.160 --> 42:01.360
for collusion.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.800
Now this is frankly a massive undertaking

42:03.800 --> 42:05.920
so I basically want to tell you my story,

42:05.920 --> 42:08.040
why I decided it and what I'm going to do

42:08.040 --> 42:10.320
and what it would take to actually succeed

42:10.320 --> 42:12.880
because frankly, I need your help on this.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.320
I have all the experiences that Jack Conte,

42:15.320 --> 42:16.840
CEO of Patreon,

42:16.840 --> 42:18.440
wants to make an appeal

42:18.440 --> 42:22.440
and to know the truth about all of us.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.160
Because frankly,

42:24.160 --> 42:26.920
Jack, your company is the arena.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.040
And if you're going to fund it,

42:28.040 --> 42:29.760
the best fund is to send the money

42:29.760 --> 42:31.560
and to open it in the next year,

42:31.560 --> 42:34.040
but I'm saying that you have to pay the bills.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.640
We have to pay the bills,

42:35.640 --> 42:37.160
if you're going to do that.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.520
But before that,

42:38.520 --> 42:39.400
the only reason why

42:39.400 --> 42:42.480
your financial platform is not functioning

42:42.480 --> 42:44.080
is because you can't find a bank

42:44.080 --> 42:45.800
to process your payments.

42:45.800 --> 42:49.440
It's possible that this is a very difficult problem

42:49.440 --> 42:51.480
from what we've imagined in principle.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.120
Many things that simply mean that

42:53.120 --> 42:54.960
Patreon has paid for Jack and Jack

42:54.960 --> 42:57.080
to buy our appropriate platform,

42:57.080 --> 42:58.400
or what it is.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.080
But I also think that we are in a situation

43:00.080 --> 43:01.680
where we have to pay the bills.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.360
More money can be made,

43:03.360 --> 43:05.680
but the more that my money is spent,

43:05.680 --> 43:07.840
it's better than what we're asking.

43:07.840 --> 43:08.920
At the same time,

43:08.920 --> 43:10.640
the next piece that we're going to talk about

43:10.640 --> 43:12.200
in the Internet of Patreon

43:12.200 --> 43:13.360
is the mechanism for which

43:13.360 --> 43:14.960
most of it is Hitler's transformation.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.200
The controversial one is extremist.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.120
Its provocateur is expanded and transformed.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.560
And the human being is inspired by terrorism

43:22.560 --> 43:24.080
or Nazi philosophy.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.040
Basically,

43:25.040 --> 43:26.480
the forms of these people

43:26.480 --> 43:28.000
transform into expression

43:28.000 --> 43:31.600
in ways to justify the sense of personalization.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.040
This, if said,

43:33.040 --> 43:34.560
is the reason why all of the media's

43:34.560 --> 43:36.120
communication methods

43:36.120 --> 43:38.200
have emphasized the capacity of Sargon

43:38.200 --> 43:40.560
and others to inspire act of violence.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.200
Don't commit act of violence to each other

43:43.200 --> 43:44.640
but to inspire others.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.880
This is the reason why the majority of media

43:46.880 --> 43:48.080
use terms like

43:48.080 --> 43:49.760
adjacent to the right

43:49.760 --> 43:52.040
or the right of the extreme.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.440
Because they guarantee that someone,

43:53.440 --> 43:54.520
in some way,

43:54.520 --> 43:56.320
will be in the mastercard

43:56.320 --> 43:59.360
or in the exterior of the sector

43:59.360 --> 44:01.240
and they will be able to utilize

44:01.240 --> 44:03.320
anti-terrorism methods

44:03.320 --> 44:04.680
such as the measures of security

44:04.680 --> 44:06.560
of the great informatics companies

44:06.560 --> 44:09.120
to make the most simple of the political decisions

44:09.120 --> 44:11.200
as if it were the catalogued

44:11.200 --> 44:12.640
discourse of the audience.

44:12.640 --> 44:15.040
Using the excuse of the inspiration.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.480
Because of Trump or Brexit,

44:17.480 --> 44:18.640
this is the signifier

44:18.640 --> 44:21.120
of the rise in the coming of the US

44:21.120 --> 44:23.280
to consolidate digital identity.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.720
And all of this, because of this,

44:24.720 --> 44:27.040
has been said a lot on the internet.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.520
There are several books about this video.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.480
There is a correction that no one

44:31.480 --> 44:33.720
has read online during the time of the war.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.200
There are also several books about

44:35.200 --> 44:36.360
all of the world,

44:36.360 --> 44:38.240
in all social rights.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.280
I'll tell you.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.040
Generally,

44:40.040 --> 44:41.840
there are no types of things.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.040
But it is well known

44:43.040 --> 44:44.680
in the Greek literature.

44:44.680 --> 44:46.360
If you have connections with a member

44:46.360 --> 44:47.800
of the intellectual rights race

44:47.800 --> 44:49.960
like Jordan Peterson or Derek Rubin,

44:49.960 --> 44:51.960
or even people with no politics

44:51.960 --> 44:53.840
like PewDiePie or Encea,

44:53.840 --> 44:55.720
you can download this video.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.800
You can also download the books.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.560
I'm not interested in receiving the credit.

44:59.560 --> 45:02.400
But it is important that we are not in the creative realm.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.200
And I don't think that this is a Patreon or PayPal.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.600
I would like to thank Monro and YouTube for their

45:07.600 --> 45:10.720
contributions to form a big part of this video.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.280
Simply by doing what I do,

45:12.280 --> 45:14.600
there is a version that you can watch.

45:14.600 --> 45:15.920
I don't want to be surprised,

45:15.920 --> 45:17.600
but I would like to mention on Twitter

45:17.600 --> 45:19.320
to make a free book for you.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.360
If you want to know about me

45:20.360 --> 45:21.240
and my projects,

45:21.240 --> 45:24.120
you can find a link to it in the description below.

45:24.120 --> 45:26.240
Today, Game Boomer Show.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.240
I talk regularly about these things.

45:28.240 --> 45:31.240
If you want to watch my tracks financially,

45:31.240 --> 45:32.000
well,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.280
this is a bit complicated, right?

45:34.280 --> 45:37.920
But I can make a few videos on PayPal.com

45:37.920 --> 45:40.240
via Short Photo Taco.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.320
Or maybe on Twitch,

45:41.320 --> 45:43.240
on Twitch.tv

45:43.240 --> 45:44.920
via Game Boomers.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.160
You have to check out my Patreon

45:46.160 --> 45:48.800
because it is only necessary.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.000
But I can't recommend it with a drink.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.520
And to do this,

45:53.520 --> 45:56.000
I will just put it in the description below.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.480
And...

45:57.480 --> 45:59.120
If you want me to not be able to

45:59.120 --> 46:01.240
make a big part of this video in time,

46:01.240 --> 46:04.240
and not simply to relish my videos with my friends,

46:04.240 --> 46:05.880
go to this Twitch page.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.760
I will continue all of the days of the week

46:07.760 --> 46:08.880
till the end.

46:08.880 --> 46:09.720
I hope to see you.
