1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,760
So, I've been playing Elden Ring on the gaming channel with my editor and lackey Dave recently.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,880
Yeah, that thumbnail's a work of art, I know.

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,000
The comment section is right down there, tell me about it.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And you know what?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's actually a pretty good game.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,760
The combat is exactly the way that a Souls-like game should be, though to be honest, the summons

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,880
make things a bit too easy sometimes.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,160
The dungeons you can find throughout the game feel exactly like an area in Dark Souls.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,620
The bosses all have that same feel, the lore, it's all just great.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,160
The addition of an open world feels a bit disjointed, I'm not going to lie, but for

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,060
what it is, it's done very well.

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,300
Open worlds in games always feel empty, because, well, they are.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,240
The reason most open world games are set in a post-apocalypse is because it's an easy

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,440
excuse to not fill the world out with people and stuff to do.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,960
Don't get me wrong, games like Fallout or Breath of the Wild have stuff to discover

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,920
in their sandboxes, and those are great games, but generally open worlds, due to this emptiness,

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,060
make the player feel like they're actually the last person on Earth, running around a

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,960
depopulated landscape.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,160
Sometimes this fits the setting well, like with Fallout.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,060
Other times it goes against the conventions of the franchise, like Zelda.

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,320
But with Elden Ring, it's a perfect pairing.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,400
Souls games, lore-wise, always have this general idea that you're fucked.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,160
The entire world's fucked, and you've got to fix it.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,840
The land has fallen into decay, the civilization is crumbling, and the few friendly creatures

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,360
that are still left are just subsisting within its rotting corpse.

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,560
The only hope is that you can rejuvenate the whole thing.

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,800
It's not like Fallout, where the land might be fucked, but there's a lot of good healthy

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
people still running around.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,200
It's not like a zombie setting, where the people are fucked, but infrastructure is still

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,920
kind of intact, at least at the start.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,920
In Souls games, the story generally is that reality itself is fucked on some fundamental

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
level.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,560
Everyone and everything is cursed, including yourself, but you need to march on if there's

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,060
going to be any hope of fixing it.

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,120
The open world of Elden Ring perfectly compliments this feeling.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,520
The UI is sparse, no quest log, no mini-map, a compass of only limited usefulness.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,120
You're dropped into the world with a general idea of where to go, Stormveil Castle, and

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,400
the most direct route, while nearby, is guarded by a punishingly hard boss, Margit the Fel.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,520
If you're good at the game, you can beat him right out the gate, but the game expects you

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,740
to search the area.

41
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,040
There are bosses right out in the open, like that mounted golden knight guy or the dragon

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,500
you fight on horseback, that drop a lot of experience, as well as unique powerful items.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,760
There are also mini-dungeons to discover and explore, not marked on the map, containing

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,900
treasure and the opportunity to get stronger.

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,700
In other words, the game doesn't hold your hand.

46
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,460
It gives you a goal that you probably can't accomplish, a world full of things to discover

47
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,860
that will incrementally move you closer towards that goal, and then says, have at it.

48
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,220
That type of game design really helps hammer home the everything and everyone is fucked

49
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,180
feeling from this genre of game.

50
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,540
So is anybody surprised that the NPCs who make up Western game development raged at

51
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,700
Elden Ring's success, and at the gamers who enjoy it?

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,840
Here is a public conversation on Twitter between several developers.

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,340
One of them is an Ubisoft dev, another is a programmer, and the third one is from Guerrilla

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,460
Games, the people who made Horizon Zero Dawn.

55
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,660
The fact that Elden Ring scored a 97 on Metacritic is proof that reviewers don't give a flaming

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,280
poop about game user experience, nor PC graphics stability and performance apparently, nor

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,600
quest design really.

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,540
This exchange went viral because it showed just how out of touch these people are with

59
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,620
what gamers actually want.

60
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,100
Somebody made this mockup of what these people think a good user experience is, and this

61
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,060
looks exactly like the trash these people put out.

62
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,580
The screen is cluttered with shit, constant popups and alerts of nearby objectives or

63
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,100
quests, button prompts are everywhere, the character uselessly narrating to nobody, and

64
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,000
of course, microtransactions.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,220
This was the kind of thing we memed about on V over a decade ago.

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,540
No really, this was the meme.

67
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,100
The guy from Guerrilla ended up locking his account over the whole thing, because he really

68
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,420
showed his ass in this conversation, worse than when he made Alloy look like Nakato Avocado.

69
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,840
The original poster, meanwhile, also stated that the user experience is generally awful,

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,660
nothing feels intentional or playtested.

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,700
What an awful take.

72
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,860
Before joining Ubisoft, this guy actually worked on the UI for Battlefield 2042, a game

73
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,920
made by EA, and look at this hideous garbage.

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,580
Can you tell if these settings in the menu are on or off?

75
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,540
The color inverts when you move your cursor off the selection, so it seems like it should

76
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,940
have been on, but it's actually off when you move it away.

77
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,940
If you have to like, select it, and then move away and stare at it a bit, and then test

78
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,100
it in the game, you have failed at making your UI.

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,540
But this controversy rapidly expanded beyond Elden Ring, or its difficulty, or the quality

80
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,540
of its UI.

81
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,660
It very quickly became about hating Japanese games and Japanese game devs.

82
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,980
Not being able to equip armor from the inventory and having to go into the equipment tab is

83
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,500
its own level of hell.

84
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,320
All From Software games and IMO almost all Japanese games have a UI problem.

85
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
Could it be a difference in usability, mental model, across regions?

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,060
That last sentence is a woke way of saying Japanese people fundamentally think differently

87
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
from us.

88
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,720
And he doesn't want to sound like a racist so he says it like that.

89
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,580
This is the mother of all reasons why I just can't get myself to try most Japanese games.

90
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,540
You can instantly recognize the style and it puts me off.

91
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,840
Dark Souls revolutionized games, in the sense that instead of a story, now you can just

92
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,820
have some guy with a big sword named Myrmidon of loss, who gasps ZANDIBART FORGIVE ME when

93
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,280
he dies and then 20 YouTubers will make an hour long video about how deep your lore is.

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,640
In this anti-Japanese thing, it's not a new sentiment.

95
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,120
Here's Phil Fish in 2015 saying the same damn thing.

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,360
What do you think about recent Japanese games?

97
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
Is it what is about Japanese games that inspired us?

98
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Recent?

99
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Recent?

100
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
They suck.

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:42,400
You guys need to get with the times and make better interfaces and update your technology.

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
We're totally kicking your ass.

105
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,600
Hey Phil, what have you done since Fez?

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,480
You know that game that won Indie Game of the Year twice in two different years, completely

107
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,860
against the rules of the contest, and the second time it happened, it was because the

108
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,520
judges were also investors in your company?

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,520
And then when I made a video exposing it back in 2014, you sent me a cease and desist letter?

110
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,840
Yeah, that video is still up.

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Fuck you.

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
You're a has-been.

113
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,820
But frankly, this all just seems like anger that Western devs don't get the same love

114
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,080
as Japanese devs.

115
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Except they do.

116
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,440
There's many Western games with cult followings.

117
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,900
There's many Western games with blowout sales.

118
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,760
Ghost of Tsushima is literally the inverse of Dark Souls.

119
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,240
A Japanese game by a Western dev instead of a Western game by a Japanese dev.

120
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
And for all of its faults, it's loved.

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,480
Hollow Knight, one of my personal favorites, does the Dark Souls fallen world full of environmental

122
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,840
storytelling thing better than Dark Souls does.

123
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,080
And it's made by a Western indie studio.

124
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,440
The issue isn't Japanese versus Western.

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,180
The issue is letting your games setting, the environment, the style, breathe a little bit

126
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,200
rather than just doing this.

127
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
So how'd we get here?

128
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,620
Why is there such a drastic divide between these big-name developers and the people who

129
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,140
they make games for?

130
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,100
Well part of the reason I went over already in my G4 Frost Curin video.

131
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,320
These people don't like gamers because gamers are, frankly, very different from them.

132
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Gamers are edgier.

133
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,780
They enjoy edgier humor.

134
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,860
Game advertisements from the 90s and 2000s had no problem embracing that aspect of gaming

135
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,100
culture for example.

136
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,020
Downstream from this, gamers are very anti-censorship.

137
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,140
They didn't tolerate Jack Thompson censoring their games from the right and they don't

138
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,900
like these woke scolds censoring them from the left now.

139
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,740
The fact that things that were considered perfectly fine when I was a kid are now being

140
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,820
censored by a new generation of Puritans is a hint that we might be regressing as a society.

141
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,160
But more importantly is that gamers are competitive and competition flies directly in the face

142
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,540
of the everybody is equal, everybody gets a participation trophy, everybody is safe,

143
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,620
nobody is challenge mentality of the broader left right now.

144
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,780
And yes I'm not talking about liberals, I'm talking about progressives who coddle

145
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,620
and socialists who equalize.

146
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,780
The number of stories that people post on social media about how they were a young impressionable

147
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,560
gamer once and they were once part of the alt-right because of video games and now they

148
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,180
see their younger siblings or cousins playing games and smack talking in League of Legends

149
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,380
and getting too competitive to ever become leftoids has to be in the millions.

150
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,300
Every time one of these stories is put out there, usually in like a 30 tweet thread,

151
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,520
it gets tons of shares and likes from people who just want their biases confirmed.

152
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,040
That gamerism and leftism are mutually exclusive and that's that.

153
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
And you know what?

154
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,560
I've been thinking about this for a little bit and on some level that actually might

155
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,800
be correct.

156
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,200
It's true that a healthy competitive spirit and socialism are at odds with one another

157
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,360
on some fundamental level but it's more than that.

158
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
Here's an article from 2018, how video games are fueling the rise of the far right.

159
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,520
It's obviously a ridiculous title but I'm coming around to the idea that video games

160
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,420
absolutely fuel anti-leftism, not necessarily pro-rightism, just anti-leftism.

161
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,480
This guy, of course, links Trump and 4chan and gamergate and gamers together, claiming

162
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,060
that gamers and gamer culture recruits for the right.

163
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,140
But I do think that these things recruit for the not left.

164
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,440
And the not left isn't just the right, it's also the center and the politically unaligned.

165
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,180
These spaces are places that allow edgy humor, while the left is very padded corners about

166
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
comedy.

167
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,260
They foster competition, while the left favors equality.

168
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,340
And really gaming, actually playing a game at a high level of skill, generally favors

169
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,620
an intuitional mindset, while the left routinely ignores intuition and instead relies on pure

170
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
reason.

171
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,220
Right wing ideologies have been overrepresented and dominant throughout the history of video

172
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,220
games.

173
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,300
Although affected by context, video games have long focused on the expulsion of aliens,

174
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,420
space invaders to XCOM, fear of impure infection, half-life to the last of us, border control,

175
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,820
missile commander to Plants vs. Zombies, territory acquisition, command and conquer to Splatoon,

176
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,660
empire building, civilization to Tropico, princess recovery, Mario to Zelda, and the

177
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,340
restoration of natural harmony, Sonic to Farmville.

178
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,380
The issue is, this person is describing positive things about the right.

179
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,820
These are virtues.

180
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,940
Rescuing a person in distress, even if she's a girl, is good.

181
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,900
Border control and expulsion of invaders is good.

182
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,540
Restoration of natural harmony is good.

183
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,100
In fact, the left even agrees this stuff is good, from environmental activists to native

184
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,460
rights movements.

185
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,180
Video games put the user to work on an instinctual level, making the gamer feel impulsive agreement

186
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,540
with these ideologies.

187
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,260
Being Resident Evil is not equivalent to watching the movie, because the controller-wielding

188
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,900
gamer experiences the desires of the game as their own desires, not as the desires of

189
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
another.

190
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,980
The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan distinguished between drives and instincts.

191
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,740
While instincts come from within us, drives occur when political forces propel us in certain

192
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
directions.

193
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,500
In these terms, video games are drives masquerading as instincts, naturalizing right-wing ideologies

194
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,660
in a way that other media can't by offering its users the chance to experience them on

195
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
a personal level.

196
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,740
This is actually, post-modernism aside, a true passage.

197
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,180
This person is describing a whole section of the human condition that the left has abandoned.

198
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,260
What's actually going on here, is that video games are showing why these instincts, not

199
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,580
drives, fuck Lacan, have some merit.

200
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,220
They're letting players experience things in a simulated first-hand way, so that they

201
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,100
may better understand those things on a deeper level, rather than simply being told what

202
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
to think.

203
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,840
Again, it's intuitively knowing something through experience, rather than rationalistically

204
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,800
reading the theory of that thing.

205
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
And we know this is true.

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
That's what game feel is.

207
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,280
The idea that your mind and the controller kind of merge when you're playing a game,

208
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,800
and moving the character on the screen becomes as natural as walking around.

209
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
That's game feel.

210
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,560
That's a component of game feel, and it's an intuitional process, not a rational one.

211
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,880
And on some level, we know that this is all true, because we have a very public example

212
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,680
of a game that goes against intuition, and that is The Last of Us 2.

213
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,720
The game tries very, very hard to put forward this, both sides are equal, revenge is bad

214
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
story.

215
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,520
Everybody liked Ellie, because Ellie was a part of the first game.

216
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,160
She was what made the first game, in fact, her relationship with Joel.

217
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,520
Nobody wanted to cheer for Abby, nobody cared about Abby's side of the story.

218
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,560
But the game forced that on the player, and anybody who actually played that game, and

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,720
isn't just an establishment shill, will tell you, in different words, but they'll mean

220
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,040
the same thing, that playing as Abby, and doing things against Ellie's interest, felt

221
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,600
counter to their intuition.

222
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,920
In general, this article is actually kind of correct, but where the author writes things

223
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,220
as negatives, I think they're actually positives.

224
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,560
It's not that gaming is explicitly right-leaning, it's just explicitly not left-leaning, and

225
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,780
that there's more to politics than just right and left.

226
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,620
The effect he's appealing to here does exist, that doesn't mean that gaming is a pipeline

227
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,960
to white nationalism or whatever, it simply means that gamers are generally more immunized

228
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,760
than your average person, against socialist subversion.

229
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,160
So that explains the gamer side of the gamer-developer divide.

230
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
But what about the developer side?

231
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
How'd we get here?

232
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,080
Well, just look at the state of game dev.

233
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,840
There's sexual assault allegations at the wazoo, constant crunch and layoffs, attempts

234
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,000
to unionize that either go bust, or massively harm the company they're working for.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,960
The industry's got institutional problems, at least insofar as AAA is concerned.

236
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,260
Way more to cover in this video, but it's not just that.

237
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,480
Look at the people inside these institutions, look at how they treat what they've inherited.

238
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,440
Let me give you a rapid-fire of a bunch of shit, cause there's just too much of it to

239
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
go over.

240
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,600
Ubisoft's controversy about Assassin's Creed Odyssey in 2019, Wokes Gold's complained

241
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,320
that the player was forced into a heterosexual relationship, which made sense in the lore

242
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,200
of the game, because the past in Assassin's Creed, in this case Ancient Greece, is a simulation

243
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,540
by the Animus Machine, created by reading the DNA of a presently alive person, which

244
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,120
contains the genetic memory of their ancestors.

245
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,500
If the character in Odyssey was gay, they wouldn't have reproduced, and their genetic

246
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,280
memory wouldn't exist today.

247
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,860
Lore just doesn't matter though nowadays, and Ubisoft added gay relationships in a DLC,

248
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,920
with probably the dumbest of the Wokes Golds saying, this is an important first step towards

249
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,320
mitigating the damage.

250
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,820
The damage of a video game?

251
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,060
The damage to their stocks more like it.

252
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,360
Dead or Alive advertisement running on an Evo stream, also in 2019.

253
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,640
Dead or Alive 6 features female characters who were attractive, which Wokes Gold's found

254
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
to be problematic.

255
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,000
The ad itself contained two attractive Japanese women making jokes about jiggle physics in

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,480
video games, pointing to their own boobs.

257
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,780
Evo apologized and ended the stream early to quote, protect the integrity of their brand.

258
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,500
After the failure of Mass Effect Andromeda, the developers left EA to form their own indie

259
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,260
studio, also in 2019.

260
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,380
It's called Brass Lion Entertainment, and it's focused on creating original fictional

261
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,380
universes that center on black, brown, and other marginalized characters, cultures, and

262
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
stories.

263
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,500
Despite being funded and three years of development time, nothing has come out of Brass Lion Entertainment

264
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
yet.

265
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,460
Their website lists one unannounced action RPG and one other project, called Corner Wolves,

266
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,980
which was due to launch in 2021 as a narrative fictional PODCAST.

267
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,020
Not a game, but a podcast.

268
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,220
Well it's 2021 on their website, but it's 2020 on their Twitter.

269
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,660
It's still not out yet though, THQ Nordic hosted an AMA on 8chan at one point.

270
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,940
The GM of Microsoft Studios took the opportunity to publicly pressure THQ Nordic on Twitter.

271
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,740
A developer at DICE over on Reset Era instigated the brigading of that community towards THQ

272
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,740
Nordic.

273
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,060
Major video game publishers use social media to get their followers to perform witch hunts

274
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,300
against their competitors.

275
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,660
Diadelic Entertainment, the creator of the Deponia series, posted this with the hashtag

276
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,180
refugees welcome.

277
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
What the shit is this?

278
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,180
This is like a 10 year old simultaneously making EU migrant propaganda and foot fetish

279
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
pictures.

280
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,980
Mortal Kombat, a game series known for its ridiculous over the top amounts of violence,

281
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,760
saw the female characters in its latest entry, Mortal Kombat 11, purposefully desexualized

282
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,660
for woke reasons, despite all of the, you know, obvious violence.

283
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,940
Complaints on their Steam page and forms were immediately cracked down on.

284
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,420
Rivet from the new Ratchet and Clank game is apparently problematic because she has

285
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,500
the tiniest bit of a feminine looking figure, even though it's a fucking space rat furry

286
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,020
whatever, and the person who modelled her character has no problem telling you about

287
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,460
how the voices of trans people were ignored by higher ups when the game was being created.

288
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,700
Even though, look at her, there's nothing wrong with this.

289
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,900
In fact, people thought Rivet was trans before the game came out.

290
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,380
The issue is, the institution of game development is full of progressives.

291
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,780
People who cry over every little fucking thing, who take every moment to point out the tiniest

292
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,980
of microaggressions, and who absolutely hate the people who pay their bills, whether that's

293
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,500
their bosses or their customers.

294
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,540
The current Elden Ring thing is just the latest in a long tradition of game devs who don't

295
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,140
know how to make a good game, getting pissy because the market has spoken, and told them

296
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,180
that people like something other than what they make.

297
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,460
Maybe that's why they want to abolish the market so fucking badly.

298
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,820
But the truth is, they just suck.

299
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,940
There's no big deep mystery behind it, the stuff they make is hot garbage, and they can't

300
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
compete.

301
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,320
So they're going to use their platform to complain that people like other products more

302
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
than what they're making.

303
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,100
Remember that big shitstorm over Steam's unparalleled market share?

304
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,260
And how Randy Pitchfork made a big public virtue signal about Borderlands being a one-year

305
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,900
Epic Games Store exclusive because he wanted Steam to be taken down a peg or two?

306
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,020
Well the reason Steam got there in the first place, is because it just does everything

307
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,220
that people want it to do.

308
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,000
No bullshit, no fuss, and really, only a few problems.

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,140
Steam's competitors suck.

310
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,820
They ban people for the wrong opinions on or off platform, they support awful business

311
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,980
practices, they implement bad business practices themselves, and Prague support them not because

312
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,060
they want to demonopolize Steam, but because they envision themselves as wielding that

313
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,820
power in their favor.

314
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,660
And this Elden Ring situation is just like that.

315
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,860
Elden Ring does what gamers want it to do.

316
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,860
It's popular.

317
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,240
It's the big thing on social media right now.

318
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,620
And the game devs who view their job as not creating fun or interesting games, but instead

319
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,500
as directing the flow of culture, are livid that they're being eroded around.

320
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,480
Elden Ring is a game that explicitly does not hold your hand.

321
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
It's punishing.

322
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
It requires something of you to play it.

323
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,000
Not a lot, just that you familiarize yourself with its rules.

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,840
It won't tell you where to go or what to do.

325
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,600
It will ask you to engage your brain and figure it out the way that older games once did.

326
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,120
And it will also demand that you learn its combat rather than simply mashing the A button

327
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
to win.

328
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,120
It's not toxic gamer culture that you have to play by its rules.

329
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,280
It's called getting good.

330
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,840
And getting good is part of the fun.

331
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,160
Ultimately, it's just a good dose of escapism.

332
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,840
Prague's cry about how everything's political, there's no neutral consumption, there's

333
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
no escapism.

334
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,760
Frankly, that just means that they're the thing that people need to escape from in the

335
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
first place.

336
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,920
Alright guys, that's about it for me.

337
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,360
Hope you enjoyed the video.

338
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,440
Yes, trucker video's still coming, it's a big one, I'm working on it, don't worry.

339
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm streaming tonight on the gaming channel, that's Game Boomers.

340
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,120
You'll find us on Twitch and YouTube.

341
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
And you know what?

342
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,560
We're playing Elden Ring.

343
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
I'll see you there guys.

344
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,080
I love you.
