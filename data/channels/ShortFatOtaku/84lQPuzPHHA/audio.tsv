0	17760	So, I've been playing Elden Ring on the gaming channel with my editor and lackey Dave recently.
17760	19880	Yeah, that thumbnail's a work of art, I know.
19880	22000	The comment section is right down there, tell me about it.
22000	23000	And you know what?
23000	24000	It's actually a pretty good game.
24000	27760	The combat is exactly the way that a Souls-like game should be, though to be honest, the summons
27760	29880	make things a bit too easy sometimes.
29880	34160	The dungeons you can find throughout the game feel exactly like an area in Dark Souls.
34160	37620	The bosses all have that same feel, the lore, it's all just great.
37620	41160	The addition of an open world feels a bit disjointed, I'm not going to lie, but for
41160	43060	what it is, it's done very well.
43060	47300	Open worlds in games always feel empty, because, well, they are.
47300	51240	The reason most open world games are set in a post-apocalypse is because it's an easy
51240	54440	excuse to not fill the world out with people and stuff to do.
54440	57960	Don't get me wrong, games like Fallout or Breath of the Wild have stuff to discover
57960	62920	in their sandboxes, and those are great games, but generally open worlds, due to this emptiness,
62920	66060	make the player feel like they're actually the last person on Earth, running around a
66060	67960	depopulated landscape.
67960	70160	Sometimes this fits the setting well, like with Fallout.
70160	73060	Other times it goes against the conventions of the franchise, like Zelda.
73060	75320	But with Elden Ring, it's a perfect pairing.
75320	79400	Souls games, lore-wise, always have this general idea that you're fucked.
79400	81160	The entire world's fucked, and you've got to fix it.
81160	85840	The land has fallen into decay, the civilization is crumbling, and the few friendly creatures
85840	89360	that are still left are just subsisting within its rotting corpse.
89360	91560	The only hope is that you can rejuvenate the whole thing.
91560	94800	It's not like Fallout, where the land might be fucked, but there's a lot of good healthy
94800	95800	people still running around.
95800	99200	It's not like a zombie setting, where the people are fucked, but infrastructure is still
99200	100920	kind of intact, at least at the start.
100920	105920	In Souls games, the story generally is that reality itself is fucked on some fundamental
105920	106920	level.
106920	110560	Everyone and everything is cursed, including yourself, but you need to march on if there's
110560	112060	going to be any hope of fixing it.
112060	115120	The open world of Elden Ring perfectly compliments this feeling.
115120	119520	The UI is sparse, no quest log, no mini-map, a compass of only limited usefulness.
119520	123120	You're dropped into the world with a general idea of where to go, Stormveil Castle, and
123120	128400	the most direct route, while nearby, is guarded by a punishingly hard boss, Margit the Fel.
128400	131520	If you're good at the game, you can beat him right out the gate, but the game expects you
131520	132740	to search the area.
132740	137040	There are bosses right out in the open, like that mounted golden knight guy or the dragon
137040	141500	you fight on horseback, that drop a lot of experience, as well as unique powerful items.
141500	145760	There are also mini-dungeons to discover and explore, not marked on the map, containing
145760	147900	treasure and the opportunity to get stronger.
147900	149700	In other words, the game doesn't hold your hand.
149700	153460	It gives you a goal that you probably can't accomplish, a world full of things to discover
153460	157860	that will incrementally move you closer towards that goal, and then says, have at it.
157860	162220	That type of game design really helps hammer home the everything and everyone is fucked
162220	164180	feeling from this genre of game.
164180	169540	So is anybody surprised that the NPCs who make up Western game development raged at
169540	172700	Elden Ring's success, and at the gamers who enjoy it?
172700	175840	Here is a public conversation on Twitter between several developers.
175840	180340	One of them is an Ubisoft dev, another is a programmer, and the third one is from Guerrilla
180340	182460	Games, the people who made Horizon Zero Dawn.
182460	187660	The fact that Elden Ring scored a 97 on Metacritic is proof that reviewers don't give a flaming
187660	193280	poop about game user experience, nor PC graphics stability and performance apparently, nor
193280	194600	quest design really.
194600	198540	This exchange went viral because it showed just how out of touch these people are with
198540	200620	what gamers actually want.
200620	205100	Somebody made this mockup of what these people think a good user experience is, and this
205100	208060	looks exactly like the trash these people put out.
208060	212580	The screen is cluttered with shit, constant popups and alerts of nearby objectives or
212580	217100	quests, button prompts are everywhere, the character uselessly narrating to nobody, and
217100	219000	of course, microtransactions.
219000	222220	This was the kind of thing we memed about on V over a decade ago.
222220	223540	No really, this was the meme.
223540	227100	The guy from Guerrilla ended up locking his account over the whole thing, because he really
227100	231420	showed his ass in this conversation, worse than when he made Alloy look like Nakato Avocado.
231420	235840	The original poster, meanwhile, also stated that the user experience is generally awful,
235840	238660	nothing feels intentional or playtested.
238660	240700	What an awful take.
240700	246860	Before joining Ubisoft, this guy actually worked on the UI for Battlefield 2042, a game
246860	249920	made by EA, and look at this hideous garbage.
249920	252580	Can you tell if these settings in the menu are on or off?
252580	256540	The color inverts when you move your cursor off the selection, so it seems like it should
256540	258940	have been on, but it's actually off when you move it away.
258940	262940	If you have to like, select it, and then move away and stare at it a bit, and then test
262940	266100	it in the game, you have failed at making your UI.
266100	270540	But this controversy rapidly expanded beyond Elden Ring, or its difficulty, or the quality
270540	271540	of its UI.
271540	275660	It very quickly became about hating Japanese games and Japanese game devs.
275660	279980	Not being able to equip armor from the inventory and having to go into the equipment tab is
279980	281500	its own level of hell.
281500	286320	All From Software games and IMO almost all Japanese games have a UI problem.
286320	289440	Could it be a difference in usability, mental model, across regions?
289440	293060	That last sentence is a woke way of saying Japanese people fundamentally think differently
293060	294060	from us.
294060	295720	And he doesn't want to sound like a racist so he says it like that.
295720	300580	This is the mother of all reasons why I just can't get myself to try most Japanese games.
300580	303540	You can instantly recognize the style and it puts me off.
303540	306840	Dark Souls revolutionized games, in the sense that instead of a story, now you can just
306840	311820	have some guy with a big sword named Myrmidon of loss, who gasps ZANDIBART FORGIVE ME when
311820	316280	he dies and then 20 YouTubers will make an hour long video about how deep your lore is.
316280	318640	In this anti-Japanese thing, it's not a new sentiment.
318640	322120	Here's Phil Fish in 2015 saying the same damn thing.
322120	325360	What do you think about recent Japanese games?
325360	328320	Is it what is about Japanese games that inspired us?
328320	329320	Recent?
329320	330320	Recent?
330320	331320	I'm sorry.
331320	332320	They suck.
332320	333320	I'm sorry.
333320	342400	You guys need to get with the times and make better interfaces and update your technology.
342400	343840	We're totally kicking your ass.
343840	349600	Hey Phil, what have you done since Fez?
349600	353480	You know that game that won Indie Game of the Year twice in two different years, completely
353480	356860	against the rules of the contest, and the second time it happened, it was because the
356860	359520	judges were also investors in your company?
359520	364520	And then when I made a video exposing it back in 2014, you sent me a cease and desist letter?
364520	365840	Yeah, that video is still up.
365840	366840	Fuck you.
366840	367840	You're a has-been.
367840	370820	But frankly, this all just seems like anger that Western devs don't get the same love
370820	372080	as Japanese devs.
372080	373080	Except they do.
373320	375440	There's many Western games with cult followings.
375440	377900	There's many Western games with blowout sales.
377900	380760	Ghost of Tsushima is literally the inverse of Dark Souls.
380760	384240	A Japanese game by a Western dev instead of a Western game by a Japanese dev.
384240	386160	And for all of its faults, it's loved.
386160	390480	Hollow Knight, one of my personal favorites, does the Dark Souls fallen world full of environmental
390480	392840	storytelling thing better than Dark Souls does.
392840	395080	And it's made by a Western indie studio.
395080	397440	The issue isn't Japanese versus Western.
397440	402180	The issue is letting your games setting, the environment, the style, breathe a little bit
402180	404200	rather than just doing this.
404200	405240	So how'd we get here?
405240	408620	Why is there such a drastic divide between these big-name developers and the people who
408620	410140	they make games for?
410140	414100	Well part of the reason I went over already in my G4 Frost Curin video.
414100	418320	These people don't like gamers because gamers are, frankly, very different from them.
418320	419320	Gamers are edgier.
419320	420780	They enjoy edgier humor.
420780	424860	Game advertisements from the 90s and 2000s had no problem embracing that aspect of gaming
424860	426100	culture for example.
426100	429020	Downstream from this, gamers are very anti-censorship.
429020	432140	They didn't tolerate Jack Thompson censoring their games from the right and they don't
432140	434900	like these woke scolds censoring them from the left now.
434900	438740	The fact that things that were considered perfectly fine when I was a kid are now being
438740	443820	censored by a new generation of Puritans is a hint that we might be regressing as a society.
443820	448160	But more importantly is that gamers are competitive and competition flies directly in the face
448160	452540	of the everybody is equal, everybody gets a participation trophy, everybody is safe,
452540	455620	nobody is challenge mentality of the broader left right now.
455620	458780	And yes I'm not talking about liberals, I'm talking about progressives who coddle
458780	460620	and socialists who equalize.
460620	464780	The number of stories that people post on social media about how they were a young impressionable
464780	468560	gamer once and they were once part of the alt-right because of video games and now they
468560	473180	see their younger siblings or cousins playing games and smack talking in League of Legends
473180	477380	and getting too competitive to ever become leftoids has to be in the millions.
477380	481300	Every time one of these stories is put out there, usually in like a 30 tweet thread,
481300	485520	it gets tons of shares and likes from people who just want their biases confirmed.
485520	489040	That gamerism and leftism are mutually exclusive and that's that.
489040	490040	And you know what?
490040	492560	I've been thinking about this for a little bit and on some level that actually might
492560	493800	be correct.
493800	497200	It's true that a healthy competitive spirit and socialism are at odds with one another
497200	499360	on some fundamental level but it's more than that.
499360	503280	Here's an article from 2018, how video games are fueling the rise of the far right.
503280	506520	It's obviously a ridiculous title but I'm coming around to the idea that video games
506520	511420	absolutely fuel anti-leftism, not necessarily pro-rightism, just anti-leftism.
511420	515480	This guy, of course, links Trump and 4chan and gamergate and gamers together, claiming
515480	518060	that gamers and gamer culture recruits for the right.
518060	521140	But I do think that these things recruit for the not left.
521140	525440	And the not left isn't just the right, it's also the center and the politically unaligned.
525440	530180	These spaces are places that allow edgy humor, while the left is very padded corners about
530180	531180	comedy.
531180	533260	They foster competition, while the left favors equality.
533260	537340	And really gaming, actually playing a game at a high level of skill, generally favors
537340	542620	an intuitional mindset, while the left routinely ignores intuition and instead relies on pure
542620	543620	reason.
543620	546220	Right wing ideologies have been overrepresented and dominant throughout the history of video
546220	547220	games.
547220	551300	Although affected by context, video games have long focused on the expulsion of aliens,
551300	556420	space invaders to XCOM, fear of impure infection, half-life to the last of us, border control,
556420	560820	missile commander to Plants vs. Zombies, territory acquisition, command and conquer to Splatoon,
560820	564660	empire building, civilization to Tropico, princess recovery, Mario to Zelda, and the
564660	567340	restoration of natural harmony, Sonic to Farmville.
567340	571380	The issue is, this person is describing positive things about the right.
571380	572820	These are virtues.
572820	575940	Rescuing a person in distress, even if she's a girl, is good.
575940	578900	Border control and expulsion of invaders is good.
578900	580540	Restoration of natural harmony is good.
580540	585100	In fact, the left even agrees this stuff is good, from environmental activists to native
585100	586460	rights movements.
586460	591180	Video games put the user to work on an instinctual level, making the gamer feel impulsive agreement
591180	592540	with these ideologies.
592540	596260	Being Resident Evil is not equivalent to watching the movie, because the controller-wielding
596260	600900	gamer experiences the desires of the game as their own desires, not as the desires of
600900	601900	another.
601900	605980	The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan distinguished between drives and instincts.
605980	609740	While instincts come from within us, drives occur when political forces propel us in certain
609740	610740	directions.
610740	615500	In these terms, video games are drives masquerading as instincts, naturalizing right-wing ideologies
615500	619660	in a way that other media can't by offering its users the chance to experience them on
619660	620660	a personal level.
620660	623740	This is actually, post-modernism aside, a true passage.
623740	628180	This person is describing a whole section of the human condition that the left has abandoned.
628180	632260	What's actually going on here, is that video games are showing why these instincts, not
632260	634580	drives, fuck Lacan, have some merit.
634580	638220	They're letting players experience things in a simulated first-hand way, so that they
638220	642100	may better understand those things on a deeper level, rather than simply being told what
642100	643100	to think.
643100	646840	Again, it's intuitively knowing something through experience, rather than rationalistically
646840	648800	reading the theory of that thing.
648800	650000	And we know this is true.
650000	651680	That's what game feel is.
651680	656280	The idea that your mind and the controller kind of merge when you're playing a game,
656280	659800	and moving the character on the screen becomes as natural as walking around.
659800	660800	That's game feel.
660800	664560	That's a component of game feel, and it's an intuitional process, not a rational one.
664560	667880	And on some level, we know that this is all true, because we have a very public example
667880	671680	of a game that goes against intuition, and that is The Last of Us 2.
671680	677720	The game tries very, very hard to put forward this, both sides are equal, revenge is bad
677720	678720	story.
679640	682520	Everybody liked Ellie, because Ellie was a part of the first game.
682520	686160	She was what made the first game, in fact, her relationship with Joel.
686160	689520	Nobody wanted to cheer for Abby, nobody cared about Abby's side of the story.
689520	694560	But the game forced that on the player, and anybody who actually played that game, and
694560	698720	isn't just an establishment shill, will tell you, in different words, but they'll mean
698720	704040	the same thing, that playing as Abby, and doing things against Ellie's interest, felt
704040	705600	counter to their intuition.
705600	708920	In general, this article is actually kind of correct, but where the author writes things
708920	711220	as negatives, I think they're actually positives.
711220	715560	It's not that gaming is explicitly right-leaning, it's just explicitly not left-leaning, and
715560	717780	that there's more to politics than just right and left.
717780	721620	The effect he's appealing to here does exist, that doesn't mean that gaming is a pipeline
721620	725960	to white nationalism or whatever, it simply means that gamers are generally more immunized
725960	728760	than your average person, against socialist subversion.
728760	732160	So that explains the gamer side of the gamer-developer divide.
732160	733160	But what about the developer side?
733160	734160	How'd we get here?
734200	736080	Well, just look at the state of game dev.
736080	739840	There's sexual assault allegations at the wazoo, constant crunch and layoffs, attempts
739840	744000	to unionize that either go bust, or massively harm the company they're working for.
744000	747960	The industry's got institutional problems, at least insofar as AAA is concerned.
747960	750260	Way more to cover in this video, but it's not just that.
750260	754480	Look at the people inside these institutions, look at how they treat what they've inherited.
754480	757440	Let me give you a rapid-fire of a bunch of shit, cause there's just too much of it to
757440	758440	go over.
758440	761600	Ubisoft's controversy about Assassin's Creed Odyssey in 2019, Wokes Gold's complained
761600	765320	that the player was forced into a heterosexual relationship, which made sense in the lore
765320	770200	of the game, because the past in Assassin's Creed, in this case Ancient Greece, is a simulation
770200	774540	by the Animus Machine, created by reading the DNA of a presently alive person, which
774540	777120	contains the genetic memory of their ancestors.
777120	780500	If the character in Odyssey was gay, they wouldn't have reproduced, and their genetic
780500	782280	memory wouldn't exist today.
782280	786860	Lore just doesn't matter though nowadays, and Ubisoft added gay relationships in a DLC,
786860	790920	with probably the dumbest of the Wokes Golds saying, this is an important first step towards
790920	792320	mitigating the damage.
792320	793820	The damage of a video game?
793820	796060	The damage to their stocks more like it.
796060	799360	Dead or Alive advertisement running on an Evo stream, also in 2019.
799360	803640	Dead or Alive 6 features female characters who were attractive, which Wokes Gold's found
803640	804640	to be problematic.
804640	809000	The ad itself contained two attractive Japanese women making jokes about jiggle physics in
809000	811480	video games, pointing to their own boobs.
811480	816780	Evo apologized and ended the stream early to quote, protect the integrity of their brand.
816780	821500	After the failure of Mass Effect Andromeda, the developers left EA to form their own indie
821500	823260	studio, also in 2019.
823260	827380	It's called Brass Lion Entertainment, and it's focused on creating original fictional
827380	832380	universes that center on black, brown, and other marginalized characters, cultures, and
832380	833380	stories.
833380	837500	Despite being funded and three years of development time, nothing has come out of Brass Lion Entertainment
837500	838500	yet.
838500	843460	Their website lists one unannounced action RPG and one other project, called Corner Wolves,
843460	846980	which was due to launch in 2021 as a narrative fictional PODCAST.
846980	849020	Not a game, but a podcast.
849020	852220	Well it's 2021 on their website, but it's 2020 on their Twitter.
852220	856660	It's still not out yet though, THQ Nordic hosted an AMA on 8chan at one point.
856660	861940	The GM of Microsoft Studios took the opportunity to publicly pressure THQ Nordic on Twitter.
861940	867740	A developer at DICE over on Reset Era instigated the brigading of that community towards THQ
867740	868740	Nordic.
868740	873060	Major video game publishers use social media to get their followers to perform witch hunts
873060	874300	against their competitors.
874300	878660	Diadelic Entertainment, the creator of the Deponia series, posted this with the hashtag
878660	880180	refugees welcome.
880180	881180	What the shit is this?
881180	886180	This is like a 10 year old simultaneously making EU migrant propaganda and foot fetish
886180	887180	pictures.
887180	890980	Mortal Kombat, a game series known for its ridiculous over the top amounts of violence,
890980	895760	saw the female characters in its latest entry, Mortal Kombat 11, purposefully desexualized
895760	899660	for woke reasons, despite all of the, you know, obvious violence.
899660	903940	Complaints on their Steam page and forms were immediately cracked down on.
903940	907420	Rivet from the new Ratchet and Clank game is apparently problematic because she has
907420	911500	the tiniest bit of a feminine looking figure, even though it's a fucking space rat furry
911500	915020	whatever, and the person who modelled her character has no problem telling you about
915020	919460	how the voices of trans people were ignored by higher ups when the game was being created.
919460	921700	Even though, look at her, there's nothing wrong with this.
921700	924900	In fact, people thought Rivet was trans before the game came out.
924900	929380	The issue is, the institution of game development is full of progressives.
929380	933780	People who cry over every little fucking thing, who take every moment to point out the tiniest
933780	937980	of microaggressions, and who absolutely hate the people who pay their bills, whether that's
937980	939500	their bosses or their customers.
939500	943540	The current Elden Ring thing is just the latest in a long tradition of game devs who don't
943540	947140	know how to make a good game, getting pissy because the market has spoken, and told them
947140	949180	that people like something other than what they make.
949180	951460	Maybe that's why they want to abolish the market so fucking badly.
951460	952820	But the truth is, they just suck.
952820	956940	There's no big deep mystery behind it, the stuff they make is hot garbage, and they can't
956940	957940	compete.
957940	960320	So they're going to use their platform to complain that people like other products more
960320	961320	than what they're making.
961320	964100	Remember that big shitstorm over Steam's unparalleled market share?
964100	968260	And how Randy Pitchfork made a big public virtue signal about Borderlands being a one-year
968260	971900	Epic Games Store exclusive because he wanted Steam to be taken down a peg or two?
971900	976020	Well the reason Steam got there in the first place, is because it just does everything
976020	977220	that people want it to do.
977220	980000	No bullshit, no fuss, and really, only a few problems.
980000	981140	Steam's competitors suck.
981140	984820	They ban people for the wrong opinions on or off platform, they support awful business
984820	988980	practices, they implement bad business practices themselves, and Prague support them not because
988980	993060	they want to demonopolize Steam, but because they envision themselves as wielding that
993060	994820	power in their favor.
994820	997660	And this Elden Ring situation is just like that.
997660	999860	Elden Ring does what gamers want it to do.
999860	1000860	It's popular.
1000860	1002240	It's the big thing on social media right now.
1002240	1006620	And the game devs who view their job as not creating fun or interesting games, but instead
1006620	1010500	as directing the flow of culture, are livid that they're being eroded around.
1010500	1013480	Elden Ring is a game that explicitly does not hold your hand.
1013480	1014480	It's punishing.
1014480	1016240	It requires something of you to play it.
1016240	1019000	Not a lot, just that you familiarize yourself with its rules.
1019000	1020840	It won't tell you where to go or what to do.
1020840	1025600	It will ask you to engage your brain and figure it out the way that older games once did.
1025600	1029120	And it will also demand that you learn its combat rather than simply mashing the A button
1029120	1030120	to win.
1030120	1033120	It's not toxic gamer culture that you have to play by its rules.
1033120	1034280	It's called getting good.
1034280	1035840	And getting good is part of the fun.
1035840	1039160	Ultimately, it's just a good dose of escapism.
1039160	1042840	Prague's cry about how everything's political, there's no neutral consumption, there's
1042840	1043840	no escapism.
1043840	1047760	Frankly, that just means that they're the thing that people need to escape from in the
1047760	1048760	first place.
1048760	1051920	Alright guys, that's about it for me.
1051920	1053360	Hope you enjoyed the video.
1053360	1057440	Yes, trucker video's still coming, it's a big one, I'm working on it, don't worry.
1057440	1060360	I'm streaming tonight on the gaming channel, that's Game Boomers.
1060360	1062120	You'll find us on Twitch and YouTube.
1062120	1063120	And you know what?
1063120	1064560	We're playing Elden Ring.
1064560	1065560	I'll see you there guys.
1065560	1066080	I love you.
