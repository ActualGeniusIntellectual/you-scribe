00:00.000 --> 00:17.760
So, I've been playing Elden Ring on the gaming channel with my editor and lackey Dave recently.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.880
Yeah, that thumbnail's a work of art, I know.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.000
The comment section is right down there, tell me about it.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
And you know what?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
It's actually a pretty good game.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.760
The combat is exactly the way that a Souls-like game should be, though to be honest, the summons

00:27.760 --> 00:29.880
make things a bit too easy sometimes.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.160
The dungeons you can find throughout the game feel exactly like an area in Dark Souls.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.620
The bosses all have that same feel, the lore, it's all just great.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.160
The addition of an open world feels a bit disjointed, I'm not going to lie, but for

00:41.160 --> 00:43.060
what it is, it's done very well.

00:43.060 --> 00:47.300
Open worlds in games always feel empty, because, well, they are.

00:47.300 --> 00:51.240
The reason most open world games are set in a post-apocalypse is because it's an easy

00:51.240 --> 00:54.440
excuse to not fill the world out with people and stuff to do.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.960
Don't get me wrong, games like Fallout or Breath of the Wild have stuff to discover

00:57.960 --> 01:02.920
in their sandboxes, and those are great games, but generally open worlds, due to this emptiness,

01:02.920 --> 01:06.060
make the player feel like they're actually the last person on Earth, running around a

01:06.060 --> 01:07.960
depopulated landscape.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.160
Sometimes this fits the setting well, like with Fallout.

01:10.160 --> 01:13.060
Other times it goes against the conventions of the franchise, like Zelda.

01:13.060 --> 01:15.320
But with Elden Ring, it's a perfect pairing.

01:15.320 --> 01:19.400
Souls games, lore-wise, always have this general idea that you're fucked.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.160
The entire world's fucked, and you've got to fix it.

01:21.160 --> 01:25.840
The land has fallen into decay, the civilization is crumbling, and the few friendly creatures

01:25.840 --> 01:29.360
that are still left are just subsisting within its rotting corpse.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.560
The only hope is that you can rejuvenate the whole thing.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.800
It's not like Fallout, where the land might be fucked, but there's a lot of good healthy

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
people still running around.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.200
It's not like a zombie setting, where the people are fucked, but infrastructure is still

01:39.200 --> 01:40.920
kind of intact, at least at the start.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.920
In Souls games, the story generally is that reality itself is fucked on some fundamental

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
level.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.560
Everyone and everything is cursed, including yourself, but you need to march on if there's

01:50.560 --> 01:52.060
going to be any hope of fixing it.

01:52.060 --> 01:55.120
The open world of Elden Ring perfectly compliments this feeling.

01:55.120 --> 01:59.520
The UI is sparse, no quest log, no mini-map, a compass of only limited usefulness.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.120
You're dropped into the world with a general idea of where to go, Stormveil Castle, and

02:03.120 --> 02:08.400
the most direct route, while nearby, is guarded by a punishingly hard boss, Margit the Fel.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.520
If you're good at the game, you can beat him right out the gate, but the game expects you

02:11.520 --> 02:12.740
to search the area.

02:12.740 --> 02:17.040
There are bosses right out in the open, like that mounted golden knight guy or the dragon

02:17.040 --> 02:21.500
you fight on horseback, that drop a lot of experience, as well as unique powerful items.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.760
There are also mini-dungeons to discover and explore, not marked on the map, containing

02:25.760 --> 02:27.900
treasure and the opportunity to get stronger.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.700
In other words, the game doesn't hold your hand.

02:29.700 --> 02:33.460
It gives you a goal that you probably can't accomplish, a world full of things to discover

02:33.460 --> 02:37.860
that will incrementally move you closer towards that goal, and then says, have at it.

02:37.860 --> 02:42.220
That type of game design really helps hammer home the everything and everyone is fucked

02:42.220 --> 02:44.180
feeling from this genre of game.

02:44.180 --> 02:49.540
So is anybody surprised that the NPCs who make up Western game development raged at

02:49.540 --> 02:52.700
Elden Ring's success, and at the gamers who enjoy it?

02:52.700 --> 02:55.840
Here is a public conversation on Twitter between several developers.

02:55.840 --> 03:00.340
One of them is an Ubisoft dev, another is a programmer, and the third one is from Guerrilla

03:00.340 --> 03:02.460
Games, the people who made Horizon Zero Dawn.

03:02.460 --> 03:07.660
The fact that Elden Ring scored a 97 on Metacritic is proof that reviewers don't give a flaming

03:07.660 --> 03:13.280
poop about game user experience, nor PC graphics stability and performance apparently, nor

03:13.280 --> 03:14.600
quest design really.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.540
This exchange went viral because it showed just how out of touch these people are with

03:18.540 --> 03:20.620
what gamers actually want.

03:20.620 --> 03:25.100
Somebody made this mockup of what these people think a good user experience is, and this

03:25.100 --> 03:28.060
looks exactly like the trash these people put out.

03:28.060 --> 03:32.580
The screen is cluttered with shit, constant popups and alerts of nearby objectives or

03:32.580 --> 03:37.100
quests, button prompts are everywhere, the character uselessly narrating to nobody, and

03:37.100 --> 03:39.000
of course, microtransactions.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.220
This was the kind of thing we memed about on V over a decade ago.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.540
No really, this was the meme.

03:43.540 --> 03:47.100
The guy from Guerrilla ended up locking his account over the whole thing, because he really

03:47.100 --> 03:51.420
showed his ass in this conversation, worse than when he made Alloy look like Nakato Avocado.

03:51.420 --> 03:55.840
The original poster, meanwhile, also stated that the user experience is generally awful,

03:55.840 --> 03:58.660
nothing feels intentional or playtested.

03:58.660 --> 04:00.700
What an awful take.

04:00.700 --> 04:06.860
Before joining Ubisoft, this guy actually worked on the UI for Battlefield 2042, a game

04:06.860 --> 04:09.920
made by EA, and look at this hideous garbage.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.580
Can you tell if these settings in the menu are on or off?

04:12.580 --> 04:16.540
The color inverts when you move your cursor off the selection, so it seems like it should

04:16.540 --> 04:18.940
have been on, but it's actually off when you move it away.

04:18.940 --> 04:22.940
If you have to like, select it, and then move away and stare at it a bit, and then test

04:22.940 --> 04:26.100
it in the game, you have failed at making your UI.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.540
But this controversy rapidly expanded beyond Elden Ring, or its difficulty, or the quality

04:30.540 --> 04:31.540
of its UI.

04:31.540 --> 04:35.660
It very quickly became about hating Japanese games and Japanese game devs.

04:35.660 --> 04:39.980
Not being able to equip armor from the inventory and having to go into the equipment tab is

04:39.980 --> 04:41.500
its own level of hell.

04:41.500 --> 04:46.320
All From Software games and IMO almost all Japanese games have a UI problem.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.440
Could it be a difference in usability, mental model, across regions?

04:49.440 --> 04:53.060
That last sentence is a woke way of saying Japanese people fundamentally think differently

04:53.060 --> 04:54.060
from us.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.720
And he doesn't want to sound like a racist so he says it like that.

04:55.720 --> 05:00.580
This is the mother of all reasons why I just can't get myself to try most Japanese games.

05:00.580 --> 05:03.540
You can instantly recognize the style and it puts me off.

05:03.540 --> 05:06.840
Dark Souls revolutionized games, in the sense that instead of a story, now you can just

05:06.840 --> 05:11.820
have some guy with a big sword named Myrmidon of loss, who gasps ZANDIBART FORGIVE ME when

05:11.820 --> 05:16.280
he dies and then 20 YouTubers will make an hour long video about how deep your lore is.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.640
In this anti-Japanese thing, it's not a new sentiment.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.120
Here's Phil Fish in 2015 saying the same damn thing.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.360
What do you think about recent Japanese games?

05:25.360 --> 05:28.320
Is it what is about Japanese games that inspired us?

05:28.320 --> 05:29.320
Recent?

05:29.320 --> 05:30.320
Recent?

05:30.320 --> 05:31.320
I'm sorry.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.320
They suck.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.320
I'm sorry.

05:33.320 --> 05:42.400
You guys need to get with the times and make better interfaces and update your technology.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.840
We're totally kicking your ass.

05:43.840 --> 05:49.600
Hey Phil, what have you done since Fez?

05:49.600 --> 05:53.480
You know that game that won Indie Game of the Year twice in two different years, completely

05:53.480 --> 05:56.860
against the rules of the contest, and the second time it happened, it was because the

05:56.860 --> 05:59.520
judges were also investors in your company?

05:59.520 --> 06:04.520
And then when I made a video exposing it back in 2014, you sent me a cease and desist letter?

06:04.520 --> 06:05.840
Yeah, that video is still up.

06:05.840 --> 06:06.840
Fuck you.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.840
You're a has-been.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.820
But frankly, this all just seems like anger that Western devs don't get the same love

06:10.820 --> 06:12.080
as Japanese devs.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.080
Except they do.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.440
There's many Western games with cult followings.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.900
There's many Western games with blowout sales.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.760
Ghost of Tsushima is literally the inverse of Dark Souls.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.240
A Japanese game by a Western dev instead of a Western game by a Japanese dev.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.160
And for all of its faults, it's loved.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.480
Hollow Knight, one of my personal favorites, does the Dark Souls fallen world full of environmental

06:30.480 --> 06:32.840
storytelling thing better than Dark Souls does.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.080
And it's made by a Western indie studio.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.440
The issue isn't Japanese versus Western.

06:37.440 --> 06:42.180
The issue is letting your games setting, the environment, the style, breathe a little bit

06:42.180 --> 06:44.200
rather than just doing this.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.240
So how'd we get here?

06:45.240 --> 06:48.620
Why is there such a drastic divide between these big-name developers and the people who

06:48.620 --> 06:50.140
they make games for?

06:50.140 --> 06:54.100
Well part of the reason I went over already in my G4 Frost Curin video.

06:54.100 --> 06:58.320
These people don't like gamers because gamers are, frankly, very different from them.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
Gamers are edgier.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.780
They enjoy edgier humor.

07:00.780 --> 07:04.860
Game advertisements from the 90s and 2000s had no problem embracing that aspect of gaming

07:04.860 --> 07:06.100
culture for example.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.020
Downstream from this, gamers are very anti-censorship.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.140
They didn't tolerate Jack Thompson censoring their games from the right and they don't

07:12.140 --> 07:14.900
like these woke scolds censoring them from the left now.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.740
The fact that things that were considered perfectly fine when I was a kid are now being

07:18.740 --> 07:23.820
censored by a new generation of Puritans is a hint that we might be regressing as a society.

07:23.820 --> 07:28.160
But more importantly is that gamers are competitive and competition flies directly in the face

07:28.160 --> 07:32.540
of the everybody is equal, everybody gets a participation trophy, everybody is safe,

07:32.540 --> 07:35.620
nobody is challenge mentality of the broader left right now.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.780
And yes I'm not talking about liberals, I'm talking about progressives who coddle

07:38.780 --> 07:40.620
and socialists who equalize.

07:40.620 --> 07:44.780
The number of stories that people post on social media about how they were a young impressionable

07:44.780 --> 07:48.560
gamer once and they were once part of the alt-right because of video games and now they

07:48.560 --> 07:53.180
see their younger siblings or cousins playing games and smack talking in League of Legends

07:53.180 --> 07:57.380
and getting too competitive to ever become leftoids has to be in the millions.

07:57.380 --> 08:01.300
Every time one of these stories is put out there, usually in like a 30 tweet thread,

08:01.300 --> 08:05.520
it gets tons of shares and likes from people who just want their biases confirmed.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.040
That gamerism and leftism are mutually exclusive and that's that.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
And you know what?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.560
I've been thinking about this for a little bit and on some level that actually might

08:12.560 --> 08:13.800
be correct.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.200
It's true that a healthy competitive spirit and socialism are at odds with one another

08:17.200 --> 08:19.360
on some fundamental level but it's more than that.

08:19.360 --> 08:23.280
Here's an article from 2018, how video games are fueling the rise of the far right.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.520
It's obviously a ridiculous title but I'm coming around to the idea that video games

08:26.520 --> 08:31.420
absolutely fuel anti-leftism, not necessarily pro-rightism, just anti-leftism.

08:31.420 --> 08:35.480
This guy, of course, links Trump and 4chan and gamergate and gamers together, claiming

08:35.480 --> 08:38.060
that gamers and gamer culture recruits for the right.

08:38.060 --> 08:41.140
But I do think that these things recruit for the not left.

08:41.140 --> 08:45.440
And the not left isn't just the right, it's also the center and the politically unaligned.

08:45.440 --> 08:50.180
These spaces are places that allow edgy humor, while the left is very padded corners about

08:50.180 --> 08:51.180
comedy.

08:51.180 --> 08:53.260
They foster competition, while the left favors equality.

08:53.260 --> 08:57.340
And really gaming, actually playing a game at a high level of skill, generally favors

08:57.340 --> 09:02.620
an intuitional mindset, while the left routinely ignores intuition and instead relies on pure

09:02.620 --> 09:03.620
reason.

09:03.620 --> 09:06.220
Right wing ideologies have been overrepresented and dominant throughout the history of video

09:06.220 --> 09:07.220
games.

09:07.220 --> 09:11.300
Although affected by context, video games have long focused on the expulsion of aliens,

09:11.300 --> 09:16.420
space invaders to XCOM, fear of impure infection, half-life to the last of us, border control,

09:16.420 --> 09:20.820
missile commander to Plants vs. Zombies, territory acquisition, command and conquer to Splatoon,

09:20.820 --> 09:24.660
empire building, civilization to Tropico, princess recovery, Mario to Zelda, and the

09:24.660 --> 09:27.340
restoration of natural harmony, Sonic to Farmville.

09:27.340 --> 09:31.380
The issue is, this person is describing positive things about the right.

09:31.380 --> 09:32.820
These are virtues.

09:32.820 --> 09:35.940
Rescuing a person in distress, even if she's a girl, is good.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.900
Border control and expulsion of invaders is good.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.540
Restoration of natural harmony is good.

09:40.540 --> 09:45.100
In fact, the left even agrees this stuff is good, from environmental activists to native

09:45.100 --> 09:46.460
rights movements.

09:46.460 --> 09:51.180
Video games put the user to work on an instinctual level, making the gamer feel impulsive agreement

09:51.180 --> 09:52.540
with these ideologies.

09:52.540 --> 09:56.260
Being Resident Evil is not equivalent to watching the movie, because the controller-wielding

09:56.260 --> 10:00.900
gamer experiences the desires of the game as their own desires, not as the desires of

10:00.900 --> 10:01.900
another.

10:01.900 --> 10:05.980
The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan distinguished between drives and instincts.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.740
While instincts come from within us, drives occur when political forces propel us in certain

10:09.740 --> 10:10.740
directions.

10:10.740 --> 10:15.500
In these terms, video games are drives masquerading as instincts, naturalizing right-wing ideologies

10:15.500 --> 10:19.660
in a way that other media can't by offering its users the chance to experience them on

10:19.660 --> 10:20.660
a personal level.

10:20.660 --> 10:23.740
This is actually, post-modernism aside, a true passage.

10:23.740 --> 10:28.180
This person is describing a whole section of the human condition that the left has abandoned.

10:28.180 --> 10:32.260
What's actually going on here, is that video games are showing why these instincts, not

10:32.260 --> 10:34.580
drives, fuck Lacan, have some merit.

10:34.580 --> 10:38.220
They're letting players experience things in a simulated first-hand way, so that they

10:38.220 --> 10:42.100
may better understand those things on a deeper level, rather than simply being told what

10:42.100 --> 10:43.100
to think.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.840
Again, it's intuitively knowing something through experience, rather than rationalistically

10:46.840 --> 10:48.800
reading the theory of that thing.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.000
And we know this is true.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.680
That's what game feel is.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.280
The idea that your mind and the controller kind of merge when you're playing a game,

10:56.280 --> 10:59.800
and moving the character on the screen becomes as natural as walking around.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
That's game feel.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.560
That's a component of game feel, and it's an intuitional process, not a rational one.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.880
And on some level, we know that this is all true, because we have a very public example

11:07.880 --> 11:11.680
of a game that goes against intuition, and that is The Last of Us 2.

11:11.680 --> 11:17.720
The game tries very, very hard to put forward this, both sides are equal, revenge is bad

11:17.720 --> 11:18.720
story.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.520
Everybody liked Ellie, because Ellie was a part of the first game.

11:22.520 --> 11:26.160
She was what made the first game, in fact, her relationship with Joel.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.520
Nobody wanted to cheer for Abby, nobody cared about Abby's side of the story.

11:29.520 --> 11:34.560
But the game forced that on the player, and anybody who actually played that game, and

11:34.560 --> 11:38.720
isn't just an establishment shill, will tell you, in different words, but they'll mean

11:38.720 --> 11:44.040
the same thing, that playing as Abby, and doing things against Ellie's interest, felt

11:44.040 --> 11:45.600
counter to their intuition.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.920
In general, this article is actually kind of correct, but where the author writes things

11:48.920 --> 11:51.220
as negatives, I think they're actually positives.

11:51.220 --> 11:55.560
It's not that gaming is explicitly right-leaning, it's just explicitly not left-leaning, and

11:55.560 --> 11:57.780
that there's more to politics than just right and left.

11:57.780 --> 12:01.620
The effect he's appealing to here does exist, that doesn't mean that gaming is a pipeline

12:01.620 --> 12:05.960
to white nationalism or whatever, it simply means that gamers are generally more immunized

12:05.960 --> 12:08.760
than your average person, against socialist subversion.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.160
So that explains the gamer side of the gamer-developer divide.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.160
But what about the developer side?

12:13.160 --> 12:14.160
How'd we get here?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.080
Well, just look at the state of game dev.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.840
There's sexual assault allegations at the wazoo, constant crunch and layoffs, attempts

12:19.840 --> 12:24.000
to unionize that either go bust, or massively harm the company they're working for.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.960
The industry's got institutional problems, at least insofar as AAA is concerned.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.260
Way more to cover in this video, but it's not just that.

12:30.260 --> 12:34.480
Look at the people inside these institutions, look at how they treat what they've inherited.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.440
Let me give you a rapid-fire of a bunch of shit, cause there's just too much of it to

12:37.440 --> 12:38.440
go over.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.600
Ubisoft's controversy about Assassin's Creed Odyssey in 2019, Wokes Gold's complained

12:41.600 --> 12:45.320
that the player was forced into a heterosexual relationship, which made sense in the lore

12:45.320 --> 12:50.200
of the game, because the past in Assassin's Creed, in this case Ancient Greece, is a simulation

12:50.200 --> 12:54.540
by the Animus Machine, created by reading the DNA of a presently alive person, which

12:54.540 --> 12:57.120
contains the genetic memory of their ancestors.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.500
If the character in Odyssey was gay, they wouldn't have reproduced, and their genetic

13:00.500 --> 13:02.280
memory wouldn't exist today.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.860
Lore just doesn't matter though nowadays, and Ubisoft added gay relationships in a DLC,

13:06.860 --> 13:10.920
with probably the dumbest of the Wokes Golds saying, this is an important first step towards

13:10.920 --> 13:12.320
mitigating the damage.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.820
The damage of a video game?

13:13.820 --> 13:16.060
The damage to their stocks more like it.

13:16.060 --> 13:19.360
Dead or Alive advertisement running on an Evo stream, also in 2019.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.640
Dead or Alive 6 features female characters who were attractive, which Wokes Gold's found

13:23.640 --> 13:24.640
to be problematic.

13:24.640 --> 13:29.000
The ad itself contained two attractive Japanese women making jokes about jiggle physics in

13:29.000 --> 13:31.480
video games, pointing to their own boobs.

13:31.480 --> 13:36.780
Evo apologized and ended the stream early to quote, protect the integrity of their brand.

13:36.780 --> 13:41.500
After the failure of Mass Effect Andromeda, the developers left EA to form their own indie

13:41.500 --> 13:43.260
studio, also in 2019.

13:43.260 --> 13:47.380
It's called Brass Lion Entertainment, and it's focused on creating original fictional

13:47.380 --> 13:52.380
universes that center on black, brown, and other marginalized characters, cultures, and

13:52.380 --> 13:53.380
stories.

13:53.380 --> 13:57.500
Despite being funded and three years of development time, nothing has come out of Brass Lion Entertainment

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
yet.

13:58.500 --> 14:03.460
Their website lists one unannounced action RPG and one other project, called Corner Wolves,

14:03.460 --> 14:06.980
which was due to launch in 2021 as a narrative fictional PODCAST.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.020
Not a game, but a podcast.

14:09.020 --> 14:12.220
Well it's 2021 on their website, but it's 2020 on their Twitter.

14:12.220 --> 14:16.660
It's still not out yet though, THQ Nordic hosted an AMA on 8chan at one point.

14:16.660 --> 14:21.940
The GM of Microsoft Studios took the opportunity to publicly pressure THQ Nordic on Twitter.

14:21.940 --> 14:27.740
A developer at DICE over on Reset Era instigated the brigading of that community towards THQ

14:27.740 --> 14:28.740
Nordic.

14:28.740 --> 14:33.060
Major video game publishers use social media to get their followers to perform witch hunts

14:33.060 --> 14:34.300
against their competitors.

14:34.300 --> 14:38.660
Diadelic Entertainment, the creator of the Deponia series, posted this with the hashtag

14:38.660 --> 14:40.180
refugees welcome.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.180
What the shit is this?

14:41.180 --> 14:46.180
This is like a 10 year old simultaneously making EU migrant propaganda and foot fetish

14:46.180 --> 14:47.180
pictures.

14:47.180 --> 14:50.980
Mortal Kombat, a game series known for its ridiculous over the top amounts of violence,

14:50.980 --> 14:55.760
saw the female characters in its latest entry, Mortal Kombat 11, purposefully desexualized

14:55.760 --> 14:59.660
for woke reasons, despite all of the, you know, obvious violence.

14:59.660 --> 15:03.940
Complaints on their Steam page and forms were immediately cracked down on.

15:03.940 --> 15:07.420
Rivet from the new Ratchet and Clank game is apparently problematic because she has

15:07.420 --> 15:11.500
the tiniest bit of a feminine looking figure, even though it's a fucking space rat furry

15:11.500 --> 15:15.020
whatever, and the person who modelled her character has no problem telling you about

15:15.020 --> 15:19.460
how the voices of trans people were ignored by higher ups when the game was being created.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.700
Even though, look at her, there's nothing wrong with this.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.900
In fact, people thought Rivet was trans before the game came out.

15:24.900 --> 15:29.380
The issue is, the institution of game development is full of progressives.

15:29.380 --> 15:33.780
People who cry over every little fucking thing, who take every moment to point out the tiniest

15:33.780 --> 15:37.980
of microaggressions, and who absolutely hate the people who pay their bills, whether that's

15:37.980 --> 15:39.500
their bosses or their customers.

15:39.500 --> 15:43.540
The current Elden Ring thing is just the latest in a long tradition of game devs who don't

15:43.540 --> 15:47.140
know how to make a good game, getting pissy because the market has spoken, and told them

15:47.140 --> 15:49.180
that people like something other than what they make.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.460
Maybe that's why they want to abolish the market so fucking badly.

15:51.460 --> 15:52.820
But the truth is, they just suck.

15:52.820 --> 15:56.940
There's no big deep mystery behind it, the stuff they make is hot garbage, and they can't

15:56.940 --> 15:57.940
compete.

15:57.940 --> 16:00.320
So they're going to use their platform to complain that people like other products more

16:00.320 --> 16:01.320
than what they're making.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.100
Remember that big shitstorm over Steam's unparalleled market share?

16:04.100 --> 16:08.260
And how Randy Pitchfork made a big public virtue signal about Borderlands being a one-year

16:08.260 --> 16:11.900
Epic Games Store exclusive because he wanted Steam to be taken down a peg or two?

16:11.900 --> 16:16.020
Well the reason Steam got there in the first place, is because it just does everything

16:16.020 --> 16:17.220
that people want it to do.

16:17.220 --> 16:20.000
No bullshit, no fuss, and really, only a few problems.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.140
Steam's competitors suck.

16:21.140 --> 16:24.820
They ban people for the wrong opinions on or off platform, they support awful business

16:24.820 --> 16:28.980
practices, they implement bad business practices themselves, and Prague support them not because

16:28.980 --> 16:33.060
they want to demonopolize Steam, but because they envision themselves as wielding that

16:33.060 --> 16:34.820
power in their favor.

16:34.820 --> 16:37.660
And this Elden Ring situation is just like that.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.860
Elden Ring does what gamers want it to do.

16:39.860 --> 16:40.860
It's popular.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.240
It's the big thing on social media right now.

16:42.240 --> 16:46.620
And the game devs who view their job as not creating fun or interesting games, but instead

16:46.620 --> 16:50.500
as directing the flow of culture, are livid that they're being eroded around.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.480
Elden Ring is a game that explicitly does not hold your hand.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.480
It's punishing.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.240
It requires something of you to play it.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.000
Not a lot, just that you familiarize yourself with its rules.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.840
It won't tell you where to go or what to do.

17:00.840 --> 17:05.600
It will ask you to engage your brain and figure it out the way that older games once did.

17:05.600 --> 17:09.120
And it will also demand that you learn its combat rather than simply mashing the A button

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
to win.

17:10.120 --> 17:13.120
It's not toxic gamer culture that you have to play by its rules.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.280
It's called getting good.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.840
And getting good is part of the fun.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.160
Ultimately, it's just a good dose of escapism.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.840
Prague's cry about how everything's political, there's no neutral consumption, there's

17:22.840 --> 17:23.840
no escapism.

17:23.840 --> 17:27.760
Frankly, that just means that they're the thing that people need to escape from in the

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
first place.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.920
Alright guys, that's about it for me.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.360
Hope you enjoyed the video.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.440
Yes, trucker video's still coming, it's a big one, I'm working on it, don't worry.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.360
I'm streaming tonight on the gaming channel, that's Game Boomers.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.120
You'll find us on Twitch and YouTube.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.120
And you know what?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.560
We're playing Elden Ring.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.560
I'll see you there guys.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.080
I love you.
