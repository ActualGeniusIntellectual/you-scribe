00:00.000 --> 00:04.060
We all saw this coming, right? We all knew it was going to be a Bernie backstab.

00:04.060 --> 00:09.040
Sanders endorses Biden. Their staffs have, in recent days, met to discuss establishing

00:09.040 --> 00:15.300
task forces to bridge gaps between party factions. Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden on Monday

00:15.300 --> 00:19.260
during a surprise appearance on the former Vice President's live cast.

00:19.260 --> 00:23.340
Oh yeah, political candidates are streaming nowadays. It's kind of weird to think about.

00:23.340 --> 00:27.360
What's also funny to think about is that Biden gets approximately triple my views whenever

00:27.360 --> 00:32.660
I stream on SFO. Yeah, uh, I'm not a former VP. I'm not running for any kind of office.

00:32.660 --> 00:36.840
I'm literally just some loser on YouTube. I should not be getting anywhere close to

00:36.840 --> 00:42.320
Biden's numbers. I should not have been on the streams of larger YouTubers that completely

00:42.320 --> 00:48.140
dwarfed Biden's numbers. Meanwhile, whenever Trump streams his daily coronavirus updates,

00:48.140 --> 00:51.880
he gets around six figures. I guess we know where the actual interest is there.

00:51.880 --> 00:57.140
Today, I'm asking all Americans. I'm asking every Democrat. I'm asking every independent.

00:57.140 --> 01:01.000
I'm asking a lot of Republicans, not every Republican, obviously, to come together in

01:01.000 --> 01:05.760
this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse, to make sure that we defeat somebody

01:05.760 --> 01:09.360
who I believe is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country, Sanders

01:09.360 --> 01:10.360
told Biden.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.820
Are you sure that Trump is the most dangerous president? I mean, he's not the president

01:14.820 --> 01:19.400
that launched the nukes at Japan. He's not the president that presided over Korea or

01:19.400 --> 01:26.240
Vietnam or either of the Gulf Wars. Overall, Trump seems to be presiding over less death

01:26.240 --> 01:31.660
than, say, George Bush. And if this really was about Democratic partisanship, just hating

01:31.660 --> 01:35.620
on Republicans, surely you'd hate Bush more than Trump.

01:35.620 --> 01:44.380
This strange looking page is the Google cache of a tweet from Amy Siskind. It's cached because

01:44.380 --> 01:48.100
I think she deleted it very quickly as soon as she realized just how much of a terrible

01:48.100 --> 01:53.180
backlash she was getting. But check this out. Imagine if George Bush had told New York City

01:53.180 --> 01:58.160
you're on your own. These are our supplies after the planes hit the Twin Towers. This

01:58.160 --> 02:04.120
is what's happening now in every state. It might be a little bit hard to figure out what

02:04.120 --> 02:08.940
particular position this person is taking. At first glance, it sounds like an anti-Trump

02:08.940 --> 02:14.920
a Republican, but no, it's actually a Biden fan saying this. The Democrats have gone so

02:14.920 --> 02:20.960
insane that they're actually endorsing George Bush. It's kind of crazy. I mean, I recall

02:20.960 --> 02:24.300
the George Bush era. I think this is like the fourth video where I've told this story,

02:24.300 --> 02:29.660
now Jesus. But I recall the George Bush era where the Democrats' opposition to the war

02:29.660 --> 02:35.540
in Iraq was actually morally justified. They had the moral high ground in that conversation.

02:35.540 --> 02:39.980
Bush and the other neo-cons of the GOP, they basically all wanted to go play cowboy in

02:39.980 --> 02:45.340
the Middle East. And it was that monumental blunder costing hundreds of thousands of lives

02:45.340 --> 02:49.860
that basically set the Democrats up to win hard in 2008. But it's like everybody on the

02:49.860 --> 02:54.180
left has kind of forgotten that now. Maybe it's because neolibs like Obama, Hillary and

02:54.180 --> 02:59.120
Biden have more in common with George Bush style neo-cons than they all want to admit.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.680
But Bernie's gone and we all knew this would happen. I am not a fan of Bernie, but I do

03:03.680 --> 03:08.360
recognize that he's basically the head of the populist wing of the Democratic Party

03:08.360 --> 03:14.480
at this point. Biden represents the return to Obama era normalcy, the neolib, the institutional

03:14.480 --> 03:19.320
Democrat. Bernie, even though I think a lot of his policies are just factually in reality

03:19.320 --> 03:24.020
incorrect, they probably wouldn't work if actually implemented, he is at least the left's

03:24.020 --> 03:28.520
populist candidate. And you know what? Back in 2016, I actually kind of liked Bernie.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.680
I disagree with him now more than I disagreed with him then. But if I had to choose between

03:32.680 --> 03:36.440
Bernie and Hillary, I definitely would have chosen Bernie, which is why it was a massive

03:36.440 --> 03:40.220
disappointment to me when Bernie cucked out and endorsed Hillary. And here he is doing

03:40.220 --> 03:44.240
the same thing to Biden. We're going to take on the establishment. And then when I lose,

03:44.240 --> 03:49.200
I'm going to endorse the establishment, no refunds. Of course, Bernie's campaign website

03:49.200 --> 03:57.480
is still up. Donate button still here. Yeah, you can still donate. If you guys ever thought

03:57.480 --> 04:01.200
this was about anything other than paying for Bernie Sanders as fourth house, well,

04:01.200 --> 04:05.640
I've got a house you can buy for me too. I have lost pretty much all respect that I had

04:05.640 --> 04:13.680
for Bernie Sanders because it happened again. He was screwed in 2016. And rather than raining

04:13.680 --> 04:19.900
down righteous fury on the DNC and destroying it, which he could have done, and then maybe

04:19.900 --> 04:26.120
raising up some kind of new political platform and say 2020, he cucked out. He did the same

04:26.120 --> 04:33.920
thing here. If Bernie had a spine, he could say, no, fuck you. I will run as an independent.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.180
I will split the Democrat vote so hard that Trump wins with like a super majority. And

04:38.180 --> 04:43.200
I will keep doing this until the DNC smartens the fuck up. It would be massive a short term

04:43.200 --> 04:49.160
loss and long term gain. And that would be the most viable path long term for Bernie

04:49.160 --> 04:53.040
to impose whatever politics he wants on the nation. But maybe it's not about that. Maybe

04:53.040 --> 04:57.400
he really does just want to pay off his fourth house. Or maybe he wants to control the DNC,

04:57.400 --> 05:03.280
not destroy it. Maybe he legitimately thinks that Trump is so bad that the nation cannot

05:03.280 --> 05:08.400
survive four years of him, which is, by the way, what he believed in 2016. And here we

05:08.400 --> 05:13.520
are in 2020. America's not doing that bad. But listen, any Sanders fans out there, I

05:13.520 --> 05:18.200
want you to compare him with Trump on this issue. And just think about it for a minute.

05:18.200 --> 05:25.200
If back in 2016, Trump was in striking distance of reaching the nomination, but the GOP pulled

05:25.200 --> 05:30.720
some shady shit and just handed it to Jeb Bush. If that happened, do you think Trump

05:30.720 --> 05:35.200
would endorse Jeb? Do you think Trump would come out and give a full throated blowjob

05:35.200 --> 05:40.720
apology to the people that stabbed him in the back? Well, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.000
And I'm pretty sure that's also why he won in 2016. And I'm pretty sure that's why he's

05:45.000 --> 05:50.200
going to win in 2020. In fact, if Bernie were the nominee, I still don't think he'd be able

05:50.200 --> 05:55.560
to beat Trump. Bernie talks a lot about standing up to the establishment. But to actually do

05:55.560 --> 06:00.200
that, you have to stand up to them when it is politically inconvenient to do so when

06:00.200 --> 06:04.000
there's no money in it, when there's not even any chance of a larger victory, at least in

06:04.000 --> 06:09.640
the short term. But at the 11th hour, Bernie always backs down. This cartoon has been floating

06:09.640 --> 06:14.200
around for a little while now. It contrasts the difference between Biden and Bernie. And

06:14.200 --> 06:17.840
you can really tell the political persuasion of the people who comment on this cartoon.

06:17.840 --> 06:22.600
The ones who think that it makes Bernie look good are the ones who fundamentally value

06:22.600 --> 06:26.740
a revolution. And to be honest, they're also probably street punks who would spray graffiti.

06:26.740 --> 06:31.360
But nonetheless, they feel like they're political outsiders, that they have no space within

06:31.360 --> 06:36.080
regular discourse, so they have to resort to vandalizing things. They fundamentally

06:36.080 --> 06:39.880
want real change in the political system. They think this cartoon makes Bernie look

06:39.880 --> 06:44.280
good because Bernie's the rebel. Meanwhile, Biden is the man, the guy who's stopping the

06:44.280 --> 06:48.560
revolution, who's returning things to normal. Meanwhile, when Biden supporters view this

06:48.560 --> 06:54.000
cartoon, they view it as Biden doing a responsible job, cleaning up the mess left behind by some

06:54.000 --> 07:00.040
kids, stamping out radicalism within his own party, doing legitimate blue collar work rather

07:00.040 --> 07:03.960
than simply making a mess of the place. They'll view Biden here as somebody who's doing hard

07:03.960 --> 07:09.000
work while Bernie simply ineffectually complains. At the end of the day, though, I reject both

07:09.000 --> 07:14.800
of these points of view. To me, the real winner of this election will be the person who built

07:14.800 --> 07:16.440
the wall that they're both working on.
