0	4060	We all saw this coming, right? We all knew it was going to be a Bernie backstab.
4060	9040	Sanders endorses Biden. Their staffs have, in recent days, met to discuss establishing
9040	15300	task forces to bridge gaps between party factions. Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden on Monday
15300	19260	during a surprise appearance on the former Vice President's live cast.
19260	23340	Oh yeah, political candidates are streaming nowadays. It's kind of weird to think about.
23340	27360	What's also funny to think about is that Biden gets approximately triple my views whenever
27360	32660	I stream on SFO. Yeah, uh, I'm not a former VP. I'm not running for any kind of office.
32660	36840	I'm literally just some loser on YouTube. I should not be getting anywhere close to
36840	42320	Biden's numbers. I should not have been on the streams of larger YouTubers that completely
42320	48140	dwarfed Biden's numbers. Meanwhile, whenever Trump streams his daily coronavirus updates,
48140	51880	he gets around six figures. I guess we know where the actual interest is there.
51880	57140	Today, I'm asking all Americans. I'm asking every Democrat. I'm asking every independent.
57140	61000	I'm asking a lot of Republicans, not every Republican, obviously, to come together in
61000	65760	this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse, to make sure that we defeat somebody
65760	69360	who I believe is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country, Sanders
69360	70360	told Biden.
70360	74820	Are you sure that Trump is the most dangerous president? I mean, he's not the president
74820	79400	that launched the nukes at Japan. He's not the president that presided over Korea or
79400	86240	Vietnam or either of the Gulf Wars. Overall, Trump seems to be presiding over less death
86240	91660	than, say, George Bush. And if this really was about Democratic partisanship, just hating
91660	95620	on Republicans, surely you'd hate Bush more than Trump.
95620	104380	This strange looking page is the Google cache of a tweet from Amy Siskind. It's cached because
104380	108100	I think she deleted it very quickly as soon as she realized just how much of a terrible
108100	113180	backlash she was getting. But check this out. Imagine if George Bush had told New York City
113180	118160	you're on your own. These are our supplies after the planes hit the Twin Towers. This
118160	124120	is what's happening now in every state. It might be a little bit hard to figure out what
124120	128940	particular position this person is taking. At first glance, it sounds like an anti-Trump
128940	134920	a Republican, but no, it's actually a Biden fan saying this. The Democrats have gone so
134920	140960	insane that they're actually endorsing George Bush. It's kind of crazy. I mean, I recall
140960	144300	the George Bush era. I think this is like the fourth video where I've told this story,
144300	149660	now Jesus. But I recall the George Bush era where the Democrats' opposition to the war
149660	155540	in Iraq was actually morally justified. They had the moral high ground in that conversation.
155540	159980	Bush and the other neo-cons of the GOP, they basically all wanted to go play cowboy in
159980	165340	the Middle East. And it was that monumental blunder costing hundreds of thousands of lives
165340	169860	that basically set the Democrats up to win hard in 2008. But it's like everybody on the
169860	174180	left has kind of forgotten that now. Maybe it's because neolibs like Obama, Hillary and
174180	179120	Biden have more in common with George Bush style neo-cons than they all want to admit.
179120	183680	But Bernie's gone and we all knew this would happen. I am not a fan of Bernie, but I do
183680	188360	recognize that he's basically the head of the populist wing of the Democratic Party
188360	194480	at this point. Biden represents the return to Obama era normalcy, the neolib, the institutional
194480	199320	Democrat. Bernie, even though I think a lot of his policies are just factually in reality
199320	204020	incorrect, they probably wouldn't work if actually implemented, he is at least the left's
204020	208520	populist candidate. And you know what? Back in 2016, I actually kind of liked Bernie.
208520	212680	I disagree with him now more than I disagreed with him then. But if I had to choose between
212680	216440	Bernie and Hillary, I definitely would have chosen Bernie, which is why it was a massive
216440	220220	disappointment to me when Bernie cucked out and endorsed Hillary. And here he is doing
220220	224240	the same thing to Biden. We're going to take on the establishment. And then when I lose,
224240	229200	I'm going to endorse the establishment, no refunds. Of course, Bernie's campaign website
229200	237480	is still up. Donate button still here. Yeah, you can still donate. If you guys ever thought
237480	241200	this was about anything other than paying for Bernie Sanders as fourth house, well,
241200	245640	I've got a house you can buy for me too. I have lost pretty much all respect that I had
245640	253680	for Bernie Sanders because it happened again. He was screwed in 2016. And rather than raining
253680	259900	down righteous fury on the DNC and destroying it, which he could have done, and then maybe
259900	266120	raising up some kind of new political platform and say 2020, he cucked out. He did the same
266120	273920	thing here. If Bernie had a spine, he could say, no, fuck you. I will run as an independent.
273920	278180	I will split the Democrat vote so hard that Trump wins with like a super majority. And
278180	283200	I will keep doing this until the DNC smartens the fuck up. It would be massive a short term
283200	289160	loss and long term gain. And that would be the most viable path long term for Bernie
289160	293040	to impose whatever politics he wants on the nation. But maybe it's not about that. Maybe
293040	297400	he really does just want to pay off his fourth house. Or maybe he wants to control the DNC,
297400	303280	not destroy it. Maybe he legitimately thinks that Trump is so bad that the nation cannot
303280	308400	survive four years of him, which is, by the way, what he believed in 2016. And here we
308400	313520	are in 2020. America's not doing that bad. But listen, any Sanders fans out there, I
313520	318200	want you to compare him with Trump on this issue. And just think about it for a minute.
318200	325200	If back in 2016, Trump was in striking distance of reaching the nomination, but the GOP pulled
325200	330720	some shady shit and just handed it to Jeb Bush. If that happened, do you think Trump
330720	335200	would endorse Jeb? Do you think Trump would come out and give a full throated blowjob
335200	340720	apology to the people that stabbed him in the back? Well, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't.
340720	345000	And I'm pretty sure that's also why he won in 2016. And I'm pretty sure that's why he's
345000	350200	going to win in 2020. In fact, if Bernie were the nominee, I still don't think he'd be able
350200	355560	to beat Trump. Bernie talks a lot about standing up to the establishment. But to actually do
355560	360200	that, you have to stand up to them when it is politically inconvenient to do so when
360200	364000	there's no money in it, when there's not even any chance of a larger victory, at least in
364000	369640	the short term. But at the 11th hour, Bernie always backs down. This cartoon has been floating
369640	374200	around for a little while now. It contrasts the difference between Biden and Bernie. And
374200	377840	you can really tell the political persuasion of the people who comment on this cartoon.
377840	382600	The ones who think that it makes Bernie look good are the ones who fundamentally value
382600	386740	a revolution. And to be honest, they're also probably street punks who would spray graffiti.
386740	391360	But nonetheless, they feel like they're political outsiders, that they have no space within
391360	396080	regular discourse, so they have to resort to vandalizing things. They fundamentally
396080	399880	want real change in the political system. They think this cartoon makes Bernie look
399880	404280	good because Bernie's the rebel. Meanwhile, Biden is the man, the guy who's stopping the
404280	408560	revolution, who's returning things to normal. Meanwhile, when Biden supporters view this
408560	414000	cartoon, they view it as Biden doing a responsible job, cleaning up the mess left behind by some
414000	420040	kids, stamping out radicalism within his own party, doing legitimate blue collar work rather
420040	423960	than simply making a mess of the place. They'll view Biden here as somebody who's doing hard
423960	429000	work while Bernie simply ineffectually complains. At the end of the day, though, I reject both
429000	434800	of these points of view. To me, the real winner of this election will be the person who built
434800	436440	the wall that they're both working on.
