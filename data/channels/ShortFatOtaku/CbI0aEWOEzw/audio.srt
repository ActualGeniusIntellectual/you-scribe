1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
We all saw this coming, right? We all knew it was going to be a Bernie backstab.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,040
Sanders endorses Biden. Their staffs have, in recent days, met to discuss establishing

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,300
task forces to bridge gaps between party factions. Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden on Monday

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,260
during a surprise appearance on the former Vice President's live cast.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,340
Oh yeah, political candidates are streaming nowadays. It's kind of weird to think about.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,360
What's also funny to think about is that Biden gets approximately triple my views whenever

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,660
I stream on SFO. Yeah, uh, I'm not a former VP. I'm not running for any kind of office.

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm literally just some loser on YouTube. I should not be getting anywhere close to

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,320
Biden's numbers. I should not have been on the streams of larger YouTubers that completely

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,140
dwarfed Biden's numbers. Meanwhile, whenever Trump streams his daily coronavirus updates,

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,880
he gets around six figures. I guess we know where the actual interest is there.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,140
Today, I'm asking all Americans. I'm asking every Democrat. I'm asking every independent.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm asking a lot of Republicans, not every Republican, obviously, to come together in

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,760
this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse, to make sure that we defeat somebody

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,360
who I believe is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country, Sanders

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
told Biden.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,820
Are you sure that Trump is the most dangerous president? I mean, he's not the president

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,400
that launched the nukes at Japan. He's not the president that presided over Korea or

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Vietnam or either of the Gulf Wars. Overall, Trump seems to be presiding over less death

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,660
than, say, George Bush. And if this really was about Democratic partisanship, just hating

21
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,620
on Republicans, surely you'd hate Bush more than Trump.

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:44,380
This strange looking page is the Google cache of a tweet from Amy Siskind. It's cached because

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,100
I think she deleted it very quickly as soon as she realized just how much of a terrible

24
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,180
backlash she was getting. But check this out. Imagine if George Bush had told New York City

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,160
you're on your own. These are our supplies after the planes hit the Twin Towers. This

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,120
is what's happening now in every state. It might be a little bit hard to figure out what

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,940
particular position this person is taking. At first glance, it sounds like an anti-Trump

28
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,920
a Republican, but no, it's actually a Biden fan saying this. The Democrats have gone so

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,960
insane that they're actually endorsing George Bush. It's kind of crazy. I mean, I recall

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,300
the George Bush era. I think this is like the fourth video where I've told this story,

31
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,660
now Jesus. But I recall the George Bush era where the Democrats' opposition to the war

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,540
in Iraq was actually morally justified. They had the moral high ground in that conversation.

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,980
Bush and the other neo-cons of the GOP, they basically all wanted to go play cowboy in

34
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,340
the Middle East. And it was that monumental blunder costing hundreds of thousands of lives

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,860
that basically set the Democrats up to win hard in 2008. But it's like everybody on the

36
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,180
left has kind of forgotten that now. Maybe it's because neolibs like Obama, Hillary and

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,120
Biden have more in common with George Bush style neo-cons than they all want to admit.

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,680
But Bernie's gone and we all knew this would happen. I am not a fan of Bernie, but I do

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,360
recognize that he's basically the head of the populist wing of the Democratic Party

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,480
at this point. Biden represents the return to Obama era normalcy, the neolib, the institutional

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,320
Democrat. Bernie, even though I think a lot of his policies are just factually in reality

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,020
incorrect, they probably wouldn't work if actually implemented, he is at least the left's

43
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,520
populist candidate. And you know what? Back in 2016, I actually kind of liked Bernie.

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,680
I disagree with him now more than I disagreed with him then. But if I had to choose between

45
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,440
Bernie and Hillary, I definitely would have chosen Bernie, which is why it was a massive

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,220
disappointment to me when Bernie cucked out and endorsed Hillary. And here he is doing

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,240
the same thing to Biden. We're going to take on the establishment. And then when I lose,

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm going to endorse the establishment, no refunds. Of course, Bernie's campaign website

49
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,480
is still up. Donate button still here. Yeah, you can still donate. If you guys ever thought

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,200
this was about anything other than paying for Bernie Sanders as fourth house, well,

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,640
I've got a house you can buy for me too. I have lost pretty much all respect that I had

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:13,680
for Bernie Sanders because it happened again. He was screwed in 2016. And rather than raining

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,900
down righteous fury on the DNC and destroying it, which he could have done, and then maybe

54
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:26,120
raising up some kind of new political platform and say 2020, he cucked out. He did the same

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,920
thing here. If Bernie had a spine, he could say, no, fuck you. I will run as an independent.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,180
I will split the Democrat vote so hard that Trump wins with like a super majority. And

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,200
I will keep doing this until the DNC smartens the fuck up. It would be massive a short term

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,160
loss and long term gain. And that would be the most viable path long term for Bernie

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,040
to impose whatever politics he wants on the nation. But maybe it's not about that. Maybe

60
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,400
he really does just want to pay off his fourth house. Or maybe he wants to control the DNC,

61
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,280
not destroy it. Maybe he legitimately thinks that Trump is so bad that the nation cannot

62
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,400
survive four years of him, which is, by the way, what he believed in 2016. And here we

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,520
are in 2020. America's not doing that bad. But listen, any Sanders fans out there, I

64
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,200
want you to compare him with Trump on this issue. And just think about it for a minute.

65
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:25,200
If back in 2016, Trump was in striking distance of reaching the nomination, but the GOP pulled

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,720
some shady shit and just handed it to Jeb Bush. If that happened, do you think Trump

67
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,200
would endorse Jeb? Do you think Trump would come out and give a full throated blowjob

68
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,720
apology to the people that stabbed him in the back? Well, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't.

69
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,000
And I'm pretty sure that's also why he won in 2016. And I'm pretty sure that's why he's

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,200
going to win in 2020. In fact, if Bernie were the nominee, I still don't think he'd be able

71
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,560
to beat Trump. Bernie talks a lot about standing up to the establishment. But to actually do

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,200
that, you have to stand up to them when it is politically inconvenient to do so when

73
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,000
there's no money in it, when there's not even any chance of a larger victory, at least in

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,640
the short term. But at the 11th hour, Bernie always backs down. This cartoon has been floating

75
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,200
around for a little while now. It contrasts the difference between Biden and Bernie. And

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,840
you can really tell the political persuasion of the people who comment on this cartoon.

77
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,600
The ones who think that it makes Bernie look good are the ones who fundamentally value

78
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,740
a revolution. And to be honest, they're also probably street punks who would spray graffiti.

79
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,360
But nonetheless, they feel like they're political outsiders, that they have no space within

80
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,080
regular discourse, so they have to resort to vandalizing things. They fundamentally

81
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,880
want real change in the political system. They think this cartoon makes Bernie look

82
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,280
good because Bernie's the rebel. Meanwhile, Biden is the man, the guy who's stopping the

83
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,560
revolution, who's returning things to normal. Meanwhile, when Biden supporters view this

84
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,000
cartoon, they view it as Biden doing a responsible job, cleaning up the mess left behind by some

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,040
kids, stamping out radicalism within his own party, doing legitimate blue collar work rather

86
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,960
than simply making a mess of the place. They'll view Biden here as somebody who's doing hard

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,000
work while Bernie simply ineffectually complains. At the end of the day, though, I reject both

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,800
of these points of view. To me, the real winner of this election will be the person who built

89
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,440
the wall that they're both working on.
