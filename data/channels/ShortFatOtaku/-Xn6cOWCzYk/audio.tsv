0	4140	A couple of very strange happenings recently have gotten my noggin a joggin.
4140	8740	In the UK, shortly after Brexit finally went through, took you guys long enough, there
8740	12680	was that segment of the BBC show Horrible Histories where they basically talked about
12680	18520	how all of those things that are considered to be quintessentially British aren't actually
18520	20520	from the UK at all.
20520	25820	Your empire's built on fighting wars, that's how your income's swollen.
25820	31260	Your British things are from abroad and most are frankly stolen.
31260	32260	Whatever next.
32260	33780	Go on, Pray Tell.
33780	35940	Our British queen is foreign as well.
35940	38740	It's true, I am of foreign descent.
38740	39740	And your husband, Albert?
39740	40740	A German, gent.
40740	43900	At least I've got a British name.
43900	44900	Victoria's Latin.
44900	46900	That's a shame!
46900	52380	British things, British things, there are none we declare.
52380	60300	All our favourite British things seem to come from elsewhere.
60300	62860	Jesus they did the queen dirty in that video.
62860	65420	Look at this face, man.
65420	71840	Last week a very similar video was put out over in Scandinavia by a Scandinavian airline
71840	76340	talking about how there is nothing fundamentally Scandinavian.
76340	78340	What is truly Scandinavian?
78340	83340	Absolutely nothing.
83340	90620	There is no such thing.
90620	92780	Everything is copied.
92780	96540	Scandinavia was brought here.
96540	99940	Piece by piece.
99940	106140	By everyday people who found the best of our home away from home.
106140	109660	Remember, this is a video designed to sell you a product.
109660	111900	What kind of brainlet thought up this marketing pitch?
111900	114660	Hey guys, how do you get people to buy our airline tickets?
114660	118020	I don't know, maybe we should tell them that their national identity doesn't exist.
118020	119020	Brilliant!
119020	121400	They'll be so demoralized they'll all buy the next flight out!
121400	126580	Now this push of your own institutions demonizing the very people that they're supposed to be
126580	127580	serving.
127580	131260	This might be new for the Brits or for the Scandinavians, but it's something that Canada's
131260	133420	had to deal with for a little while now.
133420	138220	Back in 2015, Justin Trudeau gave one of his first post-election interviews with the New
138220	139360	York Times.
139360	140820	In the interview, Trudeau stated,
140820	144500	There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada.
144500	149220	There are shared values, openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be
149220	152500	there for each other, to search for equality and justice.
152500	155440	Those qualities are what make us the first post-national state.
155440	160080	It would seem to me that these qualities, they are the core identity, and they certainly
160080	162820	are a part of a Canadian nationalism.
162820	167660	But nonetheless, Trudeau has felt for a while now that Canada is the first post-national
167660	168660	state.
168660	170500	There is no Canada in a sense.
170500	174380	However, the shorthand, there is no Canada, does not actually literally mean there is
174380	175380	no Canada.
175380	178900	In much the same way that when the airline says there's nothing about Scandinavia that's
178900	180500	inherent, they don't mean that either.
180500	181980	And the same with the British example.
181980	186220	The more practical interpretation of what they're saying is that the definition of what
186220	192060	being a Canadian is, or being a Brit is, or whatever, can and should be widened to include
192060	193180	more people.
193180	195000	And there is some logic to that.
195000	198620	If you're going to have a nation where immigrants come in, and those immigrants are there to
198620	203040	become Canadians, or to become British, or to become Swedish, or Norwegian, or whatever
203040	207260	it happens to be, if they're there not only to live in their new home, but adopt the customs
207260	211440	of the place that they're arriving to, then yes, you can make an argument that the definition
211440	214880	of what a Canadian is should be expanded to include those people.
214880	219460	We're talking about the honest immigrants, the ones who see opportunity here, work through
219460	224260	the legal process, and understand that even though their children will be culturally more
224260	227700	like the nation they have come to live in, rather than the nation that they came from,
227700	229580	they're still going to have a better life.
229580	234140	When my grandparents moved from Italy to Canada, they understood that their family line, as
234140	238780	the generations continued on, would not be Italian anymore, but the family would continue
238780	239780	on.
239780	240780	That was the important part.
240780	241780	And it did.
241780	245860	And that is why, fundamentally, a lot of immigrants have been welcomed into the West with open
245860	250620	arms because, up until recently, that policy has actually kind of worked because they were
250620	251620	willing to integrate.
251620	256420	However, the very fact that they have something to integrate into means that there is a core
256420	260620	identity, there is a mainstream, there is a Canada, there is a Britain.
260620	266820	Both Sargon and ArchWarhammer have done variations of this idea, and both of them, in their videos,
266820	270060	talk about the things that their homelands have contributed to the world.
270060	271060	And you know what?
271060	272060	I can do the same.
272060	274440	Believe it or not, Canada has actually done quite a bit.
274440	278760	We invented keyframe animation, the IMAX movie theater, and the trackball.
278760	284120	We invented pablum, canola oil, the Macintosh Apple, peanut butter, instant mashed potatoes,
284120	289960	ginger ale, poutine, then a Nymo bar, butter tarts, probably why I'm so fat, the walkie
289960	295720	talkie, amplitude modulation, standard time, the atomic clock, the Blackberry, the pager,
295720	302520	the 56K modem, wheelchair accessible buses, the baggage check, hydrofoil boats, jetliners,
302520	308600	electric streetcars, the Canadarm, that one's a big deal, the snowmobile, the electric wheelchair,
308600	314120	the compound steam engine, the snowblower, the fog horn, the gas mask, the G suit, the
314120	321380	pipe mine, sonar, lacrosse, basketball, hockey, table hockey, the goalie mask, five pin bowling,
321380	327480	the instant replay on TV, the electron microscope, the Ebola vaccine, plexiglass, the garbage
327480	333440	bag, the caesar, the drink by the way, the cardiac pacemaker, the wonder bra, the alkaline
333440	336480	battery, the caulking gun, the egg carton.
336480	342080	The point is, like every other nation, Canada has invented its own share of stuff, and like
342080	348120	every other nation, Canada has either inherited or adopted other inventions from other nations.
348120	353640	This idea that there is nothing fundamentally Canadian or British or Scandinavian or French
353640	356840	or German or any other place, it's just nonsense.
356840	363640	If you go back into the 80s, the multicultural dream of the time was nations working together
363640	368160	peacefully, all bringing their own points of view and their ideas to the table to synthesize
368160	370960	something greater, something better for humanity.
370960	375200	There was a recognition that all nations at the table existed, that they were all fundamentally
375200	378480	different, but that they coexisted peacefully and that they were willing to work together
378480	382980	for everyone's benefit, but that doesn't seem to be what multiculturalism is anymore.
382980	388140	Now it just seems to be the erasure of those that I guess the radical left considers to
388140	389140	be oppressive.
389140	393020	In that Scandinavian video they mentioned, um, we're no different from our viking ancestors.
393020	395620	We're no better than our viking ancestors.
395620	400020	Well it seems like the modern Scandinavian is a cuck, he's definitely not capable of
400020	403860	raping and pillaging the way that vikings used to, and of course there's the added hilarity
403860	407180	of it coming from a black person, we was actually vikings.
407180	411100	But more importantly, if the criticism is that the Scandinavians have blood on their
411100	414740	hands historically, name me a people that doesn't.
414740	417740	Canada treated its native population terribly.
417740	421300	No one can deny that the vikings actually did rape and pillage.
421300	425420	And I'm sure the British, back when they were the world hegemon, did some pretty distasteful
425420	426420	things.
426420	428940	But are any of us that now?
428940	434800	You can't draw a moral equivalence between what, say, my ancestors used to do as a Canadian,
434800	439340	and what a person from the Middle East or Africa does right now.
439340	443660	Obviously not all people from those places are backwards and violent, in fact a lot of
443660	446620	them are probably fleeing backwards violence.
446620	451340	But this really feels like an erasure disguised as multiculturalism, and if you object they'll
451340	454200	simply throw the sins of your ancestors in your face.
454200	458060	Which by the way is a ploy to get you to accept the sins of the people coming in, who are
458060	459460	alive right now.
459460	463740	Yes, Canadians in the past did a pretty bad extermination job on the native peoples that
463740	464740	used to live here.
464740	470220	But that does not compare to jihadis that come into Canada now and want to see the destruction
470220	471740	of the nation that they're entering.
471740	474580	If only by virtue of the fact that they're doing it right now.
474580	478360	As soon as Trudeau won his second election, he announced a pilot project to bring mass
478360	479400	immigration to Canada.
479400	484540	The cities that he selected for mass immigration are primarily places that are semi-isolated.
484540	488940	They're further north than places like Toronto, they're colder, they're rougher industry-based
488940	489940	cities.
489940	494020	And, potentially unfortunately for me, my city is on the list.
494020	498200	Let's see what some people who live in this city of mine think about this.
498200	502240	And unfortunately, unlike in the UK where the working class north rose up against the
502240	505600	far left, it seems like the people here are quite happy to see it happen.
505600	506600	This is great.
506600	510120	In a lot of cases immigrants make better, more compassionate neighbours than we are.
510120	514180	A Syrian refugee owned restaurant downtown announced today they are feeding the homeless
514180	516980	and the less fortunate between Christmas and New Years.
516980	519440	I'm very much looking forward to more diversity up here.
519440	522660	And you know what, I know exactly what Syrian refugee family he's talking about.
522660	524660	I know the restaurant, I know the family.
524660	525820	And yeah, they're good people.
525820	531080	These were legitimate refugees who came to Canada because Syria was getting fucking destroyed.
531080	533480	And you know what, they're actually starting to integrate.
533480	535920	That would be the kind of immigrant I would be happy to have here.
535920	539360	In a couple of generations, they will likely just be Canadians.
539360	542700	Good, we're experiencing a pretty severe labour shortage.
542700	543980	We need some new blood.
543980	547840	So far my experiences with immigrants in Sudbury have been overwhelmingly positive.
547840	551160	That and the fact that my grandparents immigrated to Sudbury, which is probably true of a great
551160	552740	many Sudbrarians.
552740	554980	And to be honest, I immigrated here.
554980	557420	I mean I'm obviously Canadian, but I moved to this city.
557420	558700	This is not my home city.
558700	561360	And Sudbury is definitely a city of immigrants.
561360	564180	It started as a mining town and it had to bring workers in from the outside.
564180	566780	But here's the problem with the whole labour shortage thing.
566780	569860	That means that companies need to start paying more for labour.
569860	573100	It is in fact good for the worker since wages go up.
573100	574620	But the price of labour is high.
574620	576700	Do you know what mass immigration does?
576700	578880	It drives wages down.
578880	582580	If you're experiencing a pretty severe labour shortage, now is the time for you to make
582580	583580	your money.
583580	586940	Now is not the time to flood the city with a whole bunch of migrants who will work for
586940	587940	pennies on the dollar.
587940	589660	Then of course you get this person.
589660	590660	Good.
590660	591660	Get some much needed diversity.
591660	593980	What do you mean much needed?
593980	596740	Are the native Canadians here not good enough for you to hang out with?
596740	600180	Sudbury is already a pretty big hodgepodge between the English speaking community, the
600180	602800	French speaking community, and the Aboriginal community.
602800	604640	Is that not diverse enough for you?
604640	609820	Or does diversity mean London style acid attacks and machetes being swung around downtown?
609820	613060	Was it a crisis or a tragedy when waves of Italian immigrants came here?
613060	614060	Or Finns?
614060	615060	Or Ukrainians?
615060	616060	No.
616060	617060	I agree it wasn't.
617060	618060	Because they integrated.
618060	619160	Because they integrated.
619160	621760	They brought their expertise, they brought their work ethic, they brought their unique
621760	625020	culture and they became Canadians.
625020	629580	Islamic immigration is not the same as Italian or Finn or Ukrainian.
629580	633820	Canada is bringing in immigrants from places that don't like the West.
633820	634820	They don't like Canada.
634820	635820	They don't like the States.
635820	636820	They don't like the UK.
636820	640160	And yeah, you know what, there are certainly going to be some immigrants like that Syrian
640160	642920	family that I know who came here to escape the oppression.
642920	645400	But how many terrorist cells do you think are coming in along with?
645400	647140	Or hell, forget about the terrorist cells.
647140	650580	How many people do you think are coming here to eventually agitate for Sharia law?
650580	653560	And the reason that people here just aren't objecting the way they would in the UK or
653560	657280	in the States is because of this idea that Canada is post-national.
657280	659800	That there is no essential Canadianness.
659800	663780	We are geographically and in some ways culturally very similar to America.
663780	667860	But in other ways we're very much like continental Europe and I think it's to our detriment.
667860	671860	To wrap a bow on this whole topic, we need to talk about the Laurentian Consensus.
671860	676980	The Laurentian Consensus is basically the idea that most of Canada's political power
676980	681860	is centered on cities that are along the St. Lawrence River and ever since the initial
681860	685780	colonization by the British and the French, these locations have been the political heartland
685780	686780	of Canada.
686780	690020	However, in the past 50 years, things have began to wildly shift.
690020	694300	The oil discoveries in Alberta and Newfoundland have drastically changed the politics of those
694300	695300	locations.
695300	699220	Asian immigration into British Columbia, a far more integrative form of immigration than
699220	704780	say Islamic immigration into Toronto, has made the western provinces more Pacific oriented,
704780	707540	turning them away fundamentally from the Laurentian Consensus.
707540	712460	As early as 2011, political analysts have noticed that the Laurentian Consensus has
712460	715500	been basically losing its clout within a united Canada.
715500	719900	Trudeau himself comes from this class of people within Canadian society and as he governs
719900	722620	Canada he does so with an Ontario-centric focus.
722620	727340	I don't know if you guys have heard, but Canada is kind of on fire right now.
727340	731060	Trudeau's mismanagement of the Alberta oil sands is coming into full view, British Columbia
731060	734940	politics are simply alien to him, and the Maritimes have felt like they've been hung
734940	737160	out to dry for the past 15 years.
737160	741020	Let me read you this passage from this article, and if you're a Brit or you're an American,
741020	744060	let me know if the person being described sounds familiar to you.
744060	748860	Historically, the Laurentian elite were Upper Canadian Anglo-Protestants and Quebecois patricians,
748860	752540	and their descendants still dominate the upper strata of politics, the bureaucracy,
752540	756460	crown corporations and agencies, academia, and the media.
756460	761020	Private sector membership tends towards legacy industries, often dominated by multi-generational
761020	762020	families.
762020	765820	The media, particularly the CBC, project the consensus across the country.
765820	770140	The Laurentian elite members have remarkable mobility among the upper levels of Canada's
770140	771980	government, business, and the bureaucracy.
771980	776860	Today's Laurentian elite is also arguably our franchise of the mobile, transnational
776860	778540	professional class.
778540	780980	The Anywheres, as discussed in Stephen Harper's book.
780980	786980	They are, according to Harper, urban and university-educated professionals who have become genuinely globally
786980	789680	oriented in their careers and personal lives.
789680	795100	As Anywheres, the Laurentians largely reflect the universal, broadly leftist monoculture.
795100	798500	Their personal ethos is typically secular and socially progressive.
798500	804140	Today, this includes much of the postmodern canon, intersectionality, quantifying privilege,
804140	806980	and the seemingly incessant signaling of virtue.
806980	811540	Economically, they range from socialist to corporatist, businessmen who actively seek
811540	815020	advantage from deals with the government, while typically promoting the social progressive
815020	816020	agenda.
816020	818340	If you're a Brit, maybe that sounds like the London bubble.
818340	822500	If you're an American, maybe it's Silicon Valley, Hollywood, or New York.
822500	823700	Canada has it too.
823700	827980	And these people would definitely be the type to say that there is no Canadian-ness.
827980	830220	That my country has no core identity.
830220	831660	That there's nothing special about it.
831660	834700	That there's nothing uniquely British or uniquely Scandinavian.
834700	836580	There's an advertisement, it's about 20 years old now.
836580	839420	You can find it on YouTube, but it definitely looks like a video that's 20 years old.
839420	841800	It was for the Canadian brand of beer.
841800	844100	For those of you who don't know, it's literally just called Canadian.
844100	845540	It's a great Canadian export.
845540	846980	I guess we make good beer.
846980	851100	And it was a Canadian person talking about all the things that he loves about Canada.
851100	853500	And that was the pitch as to why you should buy this beer.
853500	856480	Can you imagine this advertisement being made nowadays?
856480	861220	In an era where somebody who wears the Union Jack as a suit gets thrown out of a bar in
861220	862220	the UK.
862220	864760	An era of open borders activism.
864760	867300	And where any immigration policy makes you a racist.
867300	870900	When a German politician waves a German flag and Angela Merkel decides to steal it from
870900	872120	him and shake her head.
872120	876660	When a very simple, very positive slogan, Make America Great Again, is considered the
876660	877920	height of offense.
877920	882140	The 20th century was a lesson in the dangers of blind nationalism.
882140	886680	I can understand why some people might react to those horrors by trying to push the idea
886680	888340	that there is no nation at all.
888340	891180	But these people are what I like to call idiots.
891180	894980	There can be a nationalism that is welcoming to all those who wish to adopt the nation's
894980	896200	core values.
896200	900760	There can be a nationalism that is not mindlessly prideful, but is instead grateful for what
900760	901860	they have inherited.
901860	906580	And means not only to iterate on it, but to synthesize it with like-minded individuals.
906580	911880	There can be a Canadian nationalism that doesn't simply hate everything non-Canadian, but views
911880	916380	the Americans, the British, the French, and any other nation that adopts the core values
916380	920100	of individual freedom and human rights as old friends.
920140	924380	Competing with them, yes, but fundamentally in the spirit of cooperation.
924380	929060	Competition designed not to destroy your opponent, but to see what heights both you and they
929060	930060	could reach.
930060	933020	To me, that would be something fundamentally Canadian.
933020	935060	That would be part of our core identity.
935060	938940	No amount of radical leftist post-nationalism screeching will take that away.
938940	943220	And I have a feeling that as long as they continue to screech, they're going to keep
943220	944740	losing arguments.
944740	947260	And more importantly, they're going to keep losing elections.
