00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
A couple of very strange happenings recently have gotten my noggin a joggin.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,740
In the UK, shortly after Brexit finally went through, took you guys long enough, there

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,680
was that segment of the BBC show Horrible Histories where they basically talked about

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,520
how all of those things that are considered to be quintessentially British aren't actually

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,520
from the UK at all.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,820
Your empire's built on fighting wars, that's how your income's swollen.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,260
Your British things are from abroad and most are frankly stolen.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,260
Whatever next.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,780
Go on, Pray Tell.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,940
Our British queen is foreign as well.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,740
It's true, I am of foreign descent.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,740
And your husband, Albert?

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,740
A German, gent.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,900
At least I've got a British name.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,900
Victoria's Latin.

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
That's a shame!

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,380
British things, British things, there are none we declare.

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:01:00,300
All our favourite British things seem to come from elsewhere.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,860
Jesus they did the queen dirty in that video.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,420
Look at this face, man.

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,840
Last week a very similar video was put out over in Scandinavia by a Scandinavian airline

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,340
talking about how there is nothing fundamentally Scandinavian.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,340
What is truly Scandinavian?

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,340
Absolutely nothing.

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,620
There is no such thing.

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,780
Everything is copied.

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,540
Scandinavia was brought here.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,940
Piece by piece.

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,140
By everyday people who found the best of our home away from home.

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,660
Remember, this is a video designed to sell you a product.

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,900
What kind of brainlet thought up this marketing pitch?

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,660
Hey guys, how do you get people to buy our airline tickets?

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,020
I don't know, maybe we should tell them that their national identity doesn't exist.

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,020
Brilliant!

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,400
They'll be so demoralized they'll all buy the next flight out!

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,580
Now this push of your own institutions demonizing the very people that they're supposed to be

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,580
serving.

38
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,260
This might be new for the Brits or for the Scandinavians, but it's something that Canada's

39
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,420
had to deal with for a little while now.

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,220
Back in 2015, Justin Trudeau gave one of his first post-election interviews with the New

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,360
York Times.

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,820
In the interview, Trudeau stated,

43
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,500
There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada.

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,220
There are shared values, openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,500
there for each other, to search for equality and justice.

46
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,440
Those qualities are what make us the first post-national state.

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,080
It would seem to me that these qualities, they are the core identity, and they certainly

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,820
are a part of a Canadian nationalism.

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,660
But nonetheless, Trudeau has felt for a while now that Canada is the first post-national

50
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
state.

51
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,500
There is no Canada in a sense.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,380
However, the shorthand, there is no Canada, does not actually literally mean there is

53
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,380
no Canada.

54
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,900
In much the same way that when the airline says there's nothing about Scandinavia that's

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,500
inherent, they don't mean that either.

56
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,980
And the same with the British example.

57
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,220
The more practical interpretation of what they're saying is that the definition of what

58
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,060
being a Canadian is, or being a Brit is, or whatever, can and should be widened to include

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,180
more people.

60
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,000
And there is some logic to that.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,620
If you're going to have a nation where immigrants come in, and those immigrants are there to

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,040
become Canadians, or to become British, or to become Swedish, or Norwegian, or whatever

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,260
it happens to be, if they're there not only to live in their new home, but adopt the customs

64
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,440
of the place that they're arriving to, then yes, you can make an argument that the definition

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,880
of what a Canadian is should be expanded to include those people.

66
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,460
We're talking about the honest immigrants, the ones who see opportunity here, work through

67
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,260
the legal process, and understand that even though their children will be culturally more

68
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,700
like the nation they have come to live in, rather than the nation that they came from,

69
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,580
they're still going to have a better life.

70
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,140
When my grandparents moved from Italy to Canada, they understood that their family line, as

71
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,780
the generations continued on, would not be Italian anymore, but the family would continue

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
on.

73
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
That was the important part.

74
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
And it did.

75
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,860
And that is why, fundamentally, a lot of immigrants have been welcomed into the West with open

76
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,620
arms because, up until recently, that policy has actually kind of worked because they were

77
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,620
willing to integrate.

78
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,420
However, the very fact that they have something to integrate into means that there is a core

79
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,620
identity, there is a mainstream, there is a Canada, there is a Britain.

80
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,820
Both Sargon and ArchWarhammer have done variations of this idea, and both of them, in their videos,

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,060
talk about the things that their homelands have contributed to the world.

82
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
And you know what?

83
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,060
I can do the same.

84
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,440
Believe it or not, Canada has actually done quite a bit.

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,760
We invented keyframe animation, the IMAX movie theater, and the trackball.

86
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,120
We invented pablum, canola oil, the Macintosh Apple, peanut butter, instant mashed potatoes,

87
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,960
ginger ale, poutine, then a Nymo bar, butter tarts, probably why I'm so fat, the walkie

88
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,720
talkie, amplitude modulation, standard time, the atomic clock, the Blackberry, the pager,

89
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,520
the 56K modem, wheelchair accessible buses, the baggage check, hydrofoil boats, jetliners,

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,600
electric streetcars, the Canadarm, that one's a big deal, the snowmobile, the electric wheelchair,

91
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,120
the compound steam engine, the snowblower, the fog horn, the gas mask, the G suit, the

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,380
pipe mine, sonar, lacrosse, basketball, hockey, table hockey, the goalie mask, five pin bowling,

93
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,480
the instant replay on TV, the electron microscope, the Ebola vaccine, plexiglass, the garbage

94
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,440
bag, the caesar, the drink by the way, the cardiac pacemaker, the wonder bra, the alkaline

95
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,480
battery, the caulking gun, the egg carton.

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,080
The point is, like every other nation, Canada has invented its own share of stuff, and like

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,120
every other nation, Canada has either inherited or adopted other inventions from other nations.

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,640
This idea that there is nothing fundamentally Canadian or British or Scandinavian or French

99
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,840
or German or any other place, it's just nonsense.

100
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,640
If you go back into the 80s, the multicultural dream of the time was nations working together

101
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,160
peacefully, all bringing their own points of view and their ideas to the table to synthesize

102
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,960
something greater, something better for humanity.

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,200
There was a recognition that all nations at the table existed, that they were all fundamentally

104
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,480
different, but that they coexisted peacefully and that they were willing to work together

105
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,980
for everyone's benefit, but that doesn't seem to be what multiculturalism is anymore.

106
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,140
Now it just seems to be the erasure of those that I guess the radical left considers to

107
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
be oppressive.

108
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,020
In that Scandinavian video they mentioned, um, we're no different from our viking ancestors.

109
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,620
We're no better than our viking ancestors.

110
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,020
Well it seems like the modern Scandinavian is a cuck, he's definitely not capable of

111
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,860
raping and pillaging the way that vikings used to, and of course there's the added hilarity

112
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,180
of it coming from a black person, we was actually vikings.

113
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,100
But more importantly, if the criticism is that the Scandinavians have blood on their

114
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,740
hands historically, name me a people that doesn't.

115
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Canada treated its native population terribly.

116
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,300
No one can deny that the vikings actually did rape and pillage.

117
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,420
And I'm sure the British, back when they were the world hegemon, did some pretty distasteful

118
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,420
things.

119
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,940
But are any of us that now?

120
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,800
You can't draw a moral equivalence between what, say, my ancestors used to do as a Canadian,

121
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,340
and what a person from the Middle East or Africa does right now.

122
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,660
Obviously not all people from those places are backwards and violent, in fact a lot of

123
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,620
them are probably fleeing backwards violence.

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,340
But this really feels like an erasure disguised as multiculturalism, and if you object they'll

125
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,200
simply throw the sins of your ancestors in your face.

126
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,060
Which by the way is a ploy to get you to accept the sins of the people coming in, who are

127
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,460
alive right now.

128
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,740
Yes, Canadians in the past did a pretty bad extermination job on the native peoples that

129
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
used to live here.

130
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,220
But that does not compare to jihadis that come into Canada now and want to see the destruction

131
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,740
of the nation that they're entering.

132
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,580
If only by virtue of the fact that they're doing it right now.

133
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,360
As soon as Trudeau won his second election, he announced a pilot project to bring mass

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,400
immigration to Canada.

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,540
The cities that he selected for mass immigration are primarily places that are semi-isolated.

136
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,940
They're further north than places like Toronto, they're colder, they're rougher industry-based

137
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
cities.

138
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,020
And, potentially unfortunately for me, my city is on the list.

139
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,200
Let's see what some people who live in this city of mine think about this.

140
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,240
And unfortunately, unlike in the UK where the working class north rose up against the

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,600
far left, it seems like the people here are quite happy to see it happen.

142
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
This is great.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,120
In a lot of cases immigrants make better, more compassionate neighbours than we are.

144
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,180
A Syrian refugee owned restaurant downtown announced today they are feeding the homeless

145
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,980
and the less fortunate between Christmas and New Years.

146
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm very much looking forward to more diversity up here.

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,660
And you know what, I know exactly what Syrian refugee family he's talking about.

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
I know the restaurant, I know the family.

149
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,820
And yeah, they're good people.

150
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,080
These were legitimate refugees who came to Canada because Syria was getting fucking destroyed.

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,480
And you know what, they're actually starting to integrate.

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,920
That would be the kind of immigrant I would be happy to have here.

153
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
In a couple of generations, they will likely just be Canadians.

154
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,700
Good, we're experiencing a pretty severe labour shortage.

155
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,980
We need some new blood.

156
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,840
So far my experiences with immigrants in Sudbury have been overwhelmingly positive.

157
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,160
That and the fact that my grandparents immigrated to Sudbury, which is probably true of a great

158
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,740
many Sudbrarians.

159
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,980
And to be honest, I immigrated here.

160
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,420
I mean I'm obviously Canadian, but I moved to this city.

161
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,700
This is not my home city.

162
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,360
And Sudbury is definitely a city of immigrants.

163
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,180
It started as a mining town and it had to bring workers in from the outside.

164
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,780
But here's the problem with the whole labour shortage thing.

165
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,860
That means that companies need to start paying more for labour.

166
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,100
It is in fact good for the worker since wages go up.

167
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,620
But the price of labour is high.

168
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,700
Do you know what mass immigration does?

169
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,880
It drives wages down.

170
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,580
If you're experiencing a pretty severe labour shortage, now is the time for you to make

171
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
your money.

172
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,940
Now is not the time to flood the city with a whole bunch of migrants who will work for

173
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
pennies on the dollar.

174
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,660
Then of course you get this person.

175
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
Good.

176
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,660
Get some much needed diversity.

177
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,980
What do you mean much needed?

178
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,740
Are the native Canadians here not good enough for you to hang out with?

179
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,180
Sudbury is already a pretty big hodgepodge between the English speaking community, the

180
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,800
French speaking community, and the Aboriginal community.

181
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
Is that not diverse enough for you?

182
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,820
Or does diversity mean London style acid attacks and machetes being swung around downtown?

183
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,060
Was it a crisis or a tragedy when waves of Italian immigrants came here?

184
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
Or Finns?

185
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
Or Ukrainians?

186
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
No.

187
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
I agree it wasn't.

188
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
Because they integrated.

189
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,160
Because they integrated.

190
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,760
They brought their expertise, they brought their work ethic, they brought their unique

191
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,020
culture and they became Canadians.

192
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,580
Islamic immigration is not the same as Italian or Finn or Ukrainian.

193
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,820
Canada is bringing in immigrants from places that don't like the West.

194
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
They don't like Canada.

195
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
They don't like the States.

196
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
They don't like the UK.

197
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,160
And yeah, you know what, there are certainly going to be some immigrants like that Syrian

198
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,920
family that I know who came here to escape the oppression.

199
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,400
But how many terrorist cells do you think are coming in along with?

200
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,140
Or hell, forget about the terrorist cells.

201
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,580
How many people do you think are coming here to eventually agitate for Sharia law?

202
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,560
And the reason that people here just aren't objecting the way they would in the UK or

203
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,280
in the States is because of this idea that Canada is post-national.

204
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,800
That there is no essential Canadianness.

205
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,780
We are geographically and in some ways culturally very similar to America.

206
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,860
But in other ways we're very much like continental Europe and I think it's to our detriment.

207
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,860
To wrap a bow on this whole topic, we need to talk about the Laurentian Consensus.

208
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,980
The Laurentian Consensus is basically the idea that most of Canada's political power

209
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,860
is centered on cities that are along the St. Lawrence River and ever since the initial

210
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,780
colonization by the British and the French, these locations have been the political heartland

211
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
of Canada.

212
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,020
However, in the past 50 years, things have began to wildly shift.

213
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,300
The oil discoveries in Alberta and Newfoundland have drastically changed the politics of those

214
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
locations.

215
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,220
Asian immigration into British Columbia, a far more integrative form of immigration than

216
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,780
say Islamic immigration into Toronto, has made the western provinces more Pacific oriented,

217
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,540
turning them away fundamentally from the Laurentian Consensus.

218
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,460
As early as 2011, political analysts have noticed that the Laurentian Consensus has

219
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,500
been basically losing its clout within a united Canada.

220
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,900
Trudeau himself comes from this class of people within Canadian society and as he governs

221
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,620
Canada he does so with an Ontario-centric focus.

222
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,340
I don't know if you guys have heard, but Canada is kind of on fire right now.

223
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,060
Trudeau's mismanagement of the Alberta oil sands is coming into full view, British Columbia

224
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,940
politics are simply alien to him, and the Maritimes have felt like they've been hung

225
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,160
out to dry for the past 15 years.

226
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,020
Let me read you this passage from this article, and if you're a Brit or you're an American,

227
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,060
let me know if the person being described sounds familiar to you.

228
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,860
Historically, the Laurentian elite were Upper Canadian Anglo-Protestants and Quebecois patricians,

229
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,540
and their descendants still dominate the upper strata of politics, the bureaucracy,

230
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,460
crown corporations and agencies, academia, and the media.

231
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,020
Private sector membership tends towards legacy industries, often dominated by multi-generational

232
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
families.

233
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,820
The media, particularly the CBC, project the consensus across the country.

234
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,140
The Laurentian elite members have remarkable mobility among the upper levels of Canada's

235
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,980
government, business, and the bureaucracy.

236
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,860
Today's Laurentian elite is also arguably our franchise of the mobile, transnational

237
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,540
professional class.

238
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,980
The Anywheres, as discussed in Stephen Harper's book.

239
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,980
They are, according to Harper, urban and university-educated professionals who have become genuinely globally

240
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,680
oriented in their careers and personal lives.

241
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,100
As Anywheres, the Laurentians largely reflect the universal, broadly leftist monoculture.

242
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,500
Their personal ethos is typically secular and socially progressive.

243
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,140
Today, this includes much of the postmodern canon, intersectionality, quantifying privilege,

244
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,980
and the seemingly incessant signaling of virtue.

245
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,540
Economically, they range from socialist to corporatist, businessmen who actively seek

246
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,020
advantage from deals with the government, while typically promoting the social progressive

247
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
agenda.

248
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,340
If you're a Brit, maybe that sounds like the London bubble.

249
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,500
If you're an American, maybe it's Silicon Valley, Hollywood, or New York.

250
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
Canada has it too.

251
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,980
And these people would definitely be the type to say that there is no Canadian-ness.

252
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,220
That my country has no core identity.

253
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,660
That there's nothing special about it.

254
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,700
That there's nothing uniquely British or uniquely Scandinavian.

255
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,580
There's an advertisement, it's about 20 years old now.

256
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,420
You can find it on YouTube, but it definitely looks like a video that's 20 years old.

257
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,800
It was for the Canadian brand of beer.

258
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,100
For those of you who don't know, it's literally just called Canadian.

259
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,540
It's a great Canadian export.

260
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,980
I guess we make good beer.

261
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,100
And it was a Canadian person talking about all the things that he loves about Canada.

262
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,500
And that was the pitch as to why you should buy this beer.

263
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,480
Can you imagine this advertisement being made nowadays?

264
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,220
In an era where somebody who wears the Union Jack as a suit gets thrown out of a bar in

265
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
the UK.

266
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,760
An era of open borders activism.

267
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,300
And where any immigration policy makes you a racist.

268
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,900
When a German politician waves a German flag and Angela Merkel decides to steal it from

269
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,120
him and shake her head.

270
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,660
When a very simple, very positive slogan, Make America Great Again, is considered the

271
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,920
height of offense.

272
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,140
The 20th century was a lesson in the dangers of blind nationalism.

273
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,680
I can understand why some people might react to those horrors by trying to push the idea

274
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,340
that there is no nation at all.

275
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,180
But these people are what I like to call idiots.

276
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,980
There can be a nationalism that is welcoming to all those who wish to adopt the nation's

277
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,200
core values.

278
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,760
There can be a nationalism that is not mindlessly prideful, but is instead grateful for what

279
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,860
they have inherited.

280
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,580
And means not only to iterate on it, but to synthesize it with like-minded individuals.

281
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,880
There can be a Canadian nationalism that doesn't simply hate everything non-Canadian, but views

282
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,380
the Americans, the British, the French, and any other nation that adopts the core values

283
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,100
of individual freedom and human rights as old friends.

284
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,380
Competing with them, yes, but fundamentally in the spirit of cooperation.

285
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,060
Competition designed not to destroy your opponent, but to see what heights both you and they

286
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
could reach.

287
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,020
To me, that would be something fundamentally Canadian.

288
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,060
That would be part of our core identity.

289
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,940
No amount of radical leftist post-nationalism screeching will take that away.

290
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,220
And I have a feeling that as long as they continue to screech, they're going to keep

291
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,740
losing arguments.

292
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,260
And more importantly, they're going to keep losing elections.
