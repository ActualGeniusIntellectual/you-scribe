00:00.000 --> 00:04.140
A couple of very strange happenings recently have gotten my noggin a joggin.

00:04.140 --> 00:08.740
In the UK, shortly after Brexit finally went through, took you guys long enough, there

00:08.740 --> 00:12.680
was that segment of the BBC show Horrible Histories where they basically talked about

00:12.680 --> 00:18.520
how all of those things that are considered to be quintessentially British aren't actually

00:18.520 --> 00:20.520
from the UK at all.

00:20.520 --> 00:25.820
Your empire's built on fighting wars, that's how your income's swollen.

00:25.820 --> 00:31.260
Your British things are from abroad and most are frankly stolen.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.260
Whatever next.

00:32.260 --> 00:33.780
Go on, Pray Tell.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.940
Our British queen is foreign as well.

00:35.940 --> 00:38.740
It's true, I am of foreign descent.

00:38.740 --> 00:39.740
And your husband, Albert?

00:39.740 --> 00:40.740
A German, gent.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.900
At least I've got a British name.

00:43.900 --> 00:44.900
Victoria's Latin.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.900
That's a shame!

00:46.900 --> 00:52.380
British things, British things, there are none we declare.

00:52.380 --> 01:00.300
All our favourite British things seem to come from elsewhere.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.860
Jesus they did the queen dirty in that video.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.420
Look at this face, man.

01:05.420 --> 01:11.840
Last week a very similar video was put out over in Scandinavia by a Scandinavian airline

01:11.840 --> 01:16.340
talking about how there is nothing fundamentally Scandinavian.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.340
What is truly Scandinavian?

01:18.340 --> 01:23.340
Absolutely nothing.

01:23.340 --> 01:30.620
There is no such thing.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.780
Everything is copied.

01:32.780 --> 01:36.540
Scandinavia was brought here.

01:36.540 --> 01:39.940
Piece by piece.

01:39.940 --> 01:46.140
By everyday people who found the best of our home away from home.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.660
Remember, this is a video designed to sell you a product.

01:49.660 --> 01:51.900
What kind of brainlet thought up this marketing pitch?

01:51.900 --> 01:54.660
Hey guys, how do you get people to buy our airline tickets?

01:54.660 --> 01:58.020
I don't know, maybe we should tell them that their national identity doesn't exist.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.020
Brilliant!

01:59.020 --> 02:01.400
They'll be so demoralized they'll all buy the next flight out!

02:01.400 --> 02:06.580
Now this push of your own institutions demonizing the very people that they're supposed to be

02:06.580 --> 02:07.580
serving.

02:07.580 --> 02:11.260
This might be new for the Brits or for the Scandinavians, but it's something that Canada's

02:11.260 --> 02:13.420
had to deal with for a little while now.

02:13.420 --> 02:18.220
Back in 2015, Justin Trudeau gave one of his first post-election interviews with the New

02:18.220 --> 02:19.360
York Times.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.820
In the interview, Trudeau stated,

02:20.820 --> 02:24.500
There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada.

02:24.500 --> 02:29.220
There are shared values, openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be

02:29.220 --> 02:32.500
there for each other, to search for equality and justice.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.440
Those qualities are what make us the first post-national state.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.080
It would seem to me that these qualities, they are the core identity, and they certainly

02:40.080 --> 02:42.820
are a part of a Canadian nationalism.

02:42.820 --> 02:47.660
But nonetheless, Trudeau has felt for a while now that Canada is the first post-national

02:47.660 --> 02:48.660
state.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.500
There is no Canada in a sense.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.380
However, the shorthand, there is no Canada, does not actually literally mean there is

02:54.380 --> 02:55.380
no Canada.

02:55.380 --> 02:58.900
In much the same way that when the airline says there's nothing about Scandinavia that's

02:58.900 --> 03:00.500
inherent, they don't mean that either.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.980
And the same with the British example.

03:01.980 --> 03:06.220
The more practical interpretation of what they're saying is that the definition of what

03:06.220 --> 03:12.060
being a Canadian is, or being a Brit is, or whatever, can and should be widened to include

03:12.060 --> 03:13.180
more people.

03:13.180 --> 03:15.000
And there is some logic to that.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.620
If you're going to have a nation where immigrants come in, and those immigrants are there to

03:18.620 --> 03:23.040
become Canadians, or to become British, or to become Swedish, or Norwegian, or whatever

03:23.040 --> 03:27.260
it happens to be, if they're there not only to live in their new home, but adopt the customs

03:27.260 --> 03:31.440
of the place that they're arriving to, then yes, you can make an argument that the definition

03:31.440 --> 03:34.880
of what a Canadian is should be expanded to include those people.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.460
We're talking about the honest immigrants, the ones who see opportunity here, work through

03:39.460 --> 03:44.260
the legal process, and understand that even though their children will be culturally more

03:44.260 --> 03:47.700
like the nation they have come to live in, rather than the nation that they came from,

03:47.700 --> 03:49.580
they're still going to have a better life.

03:49.580 --> 03:54.140
When my grandparents moved from Italy to Canada, they understood that their family line, as

03:54.140 --> 03:58.780
the generations continued on, would not be Italian anymore, but the family would continue

03:58.780 --> 03:59.780
on.

03:59.780 --> 04:00.780
That was the important part.

04:00.780 --> 04:01.780
And it did.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.860
And that is why, fundamentally, a lot of immigrants have been welcomed into the West with open

04:05.860 --> 04:10.620
arms because, up until recently, that policy has actually kind of worked because they were

04:10.620 --> 04:11.620
willing to integrate.

04:11.620 --> 04:16.420
However, the very fact that they have something to integrate into means that there is a core

04:16.420 --> 04:20.620
identity, there is a mainstream, there is a Canada, there is a Britain.

04:20.620 --> 04:26.820
Both Sargon and ArchWarhammer have done variations of this idea, and both of them, in their videos,

04:26.820 --> 04:30.060
talk about the things that their homelands have contributed to the world.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.060
And you know what?

04:31.060 --> 04:32.060
I can do the same.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.440
Believe it or not, Canada has actually done quite a bit.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.760
We invented keyframe animation, the IMAX movie theater, and the trackball.

04:38.760 --> 04:44.120
We invented pablum, canola oil, the Macintosh Apple, peanut butter, instant mashed potatoes,

04:44.120 --> 04:49.960
ginger ale, poutine, then a Nymo bar, butter tarts, probably why I'm so fat, the walkie

04:49.960 --> 04:55.720
talkie, amplitude modulation, standard time, the atomic clock, the Blackberry, the pager,

04:55.720 --> 05:02.520
the 56K modem, wheelchair accessible buses, the baggage check, hydrofoil boats, jetliners,

05:02.520 --> 05:08.600
electric streetcars, the Canadarm, that one's a big deal, the snowmobile, the electric wheelchair,

05:08.600 --> 05:14.120
the compound steam engine, the snowblower, the fog horn, the gas mask, the G suit, the

05:14.120 --> 05:21.380
pipe mine, sonar, lacrosse, basketball, hockey, table hockey, the goalie mask, five pin bowling,

05:21.380 --> 05:27.480
the instant replay on TV, the electron microscope, the Ebola vaccine, plexiglass, the garbage

05:27.480 --> 05:33.440
bag, the caesar, the drink by the way, the cardiac pacemaker, the wonder bra, the alkaline

05:33.440 --> 05:36.480
battery, the caulking gun, the egg carton.

05:36.480 --> 05:42.080
The point is, like every other nation, Canada has invented its own share of stuff, and like

05:42.080 --> 05:48.120
every other nation, Canada has either inherited or adopted other inventions from other nations.

05:48.120 --> 05:53.640
This idea that there is nothing fundamentally Canadian or British or Scandinavian or French

05:53.640 --> 05:56.840
or German or any other place, it's just nonsense.

05:56.840 --> 06:03.640
If you go back into the 80s, the multicultural dream of the time was nations working together

06:03.640 --> 06:08.160
peacefully, all bringing their own points of view and their ideas to the table to synthesize

06:08.160 --> 06:10.960
something greater, something better for humanity.

06:10.960 --> 06:15.200
There was a recognition that all nations at the table existed, that they were all fundamentally

06:15.200 --> 06:18.480
different, but that they coexisted peacefully and that they were willing to work together

06:18.480 --> 06:22.980
for everyone's benefit, but that doesn't seem to be what multiculturalism is anymore.

06:22.980 --> 06:28.140
Now it just seems to be the erasure of those that I guess the radical left considers to

06:28.140 --> 06:29.140
be oppressive.

06:29.140 --> 06:33.020
In that Scandinavian video they mentioned, um, we're no different from our viking ancestors.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.620
We're no better than our viking ancestors.

06:35.620 --> 06:40.020
Well it seems like the modern Scandinavian is a cuck, he's definitely not capable of

06:40.020 --> 06:43.860
raping and pillaging the way that vikings used to, and of course there's the added hilarity

06:43.860 --> 06:47.180
of it coming from a black person, we was actually vikings.

06:47.180 --> 06:51.100
But more importantly, if the criticism is that the Scandinavians have blood on their

06:51.100 --> 06:54.740
hands historically, name me a people that doesn't.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.740
Canada treated its native population terribly.

06:57.740 --> 07:01.300
No one can deny that the vikings actually did rape and pillage.

07:01.300 --> 07:05.420
And I'm sure the British, back when they were the world hegemon, did some pretty distasteful

07:05.420 --> 07:06.420
things.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.940
But are any of us that now?

07:08.940 --> 07:14.800
You can't draw a moral equivalence between what, say, my ancestors used to do as a Canadian,

07:14.800 --> 07:19.340
and what a person from the Middle East or Africa does right now.

07:19.340 --> 07:23.660
Obviously not all people from those places are backwards and violent, in fact a lot of

07:23.660 --> 07:26.620
them are probably fleeing backwards violence.

07:26.620 --> 07:31.340
But this really feels like an erasure disguised as multiculturalism, and if you object they'll

07:31.340 --> 07:34.200
simply throw the sins of your ancestors in your face.

07:34.200 --> 07:38.060
Which by the way is a ploy to get you to accept the sins of the people coming in, who are

07:38.060 --> 07:39.460
alive right now.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.740
Yes, Canadians in the past did a pretty bad extermination job on the native peoples that

07:43.740 --> 07:44.740
used to live here.

07:44.740 --> 07:50.220
But that does not compare to jihadis that come into Canada now and want to see the destruction

07:50.220 --> 07:51.740
of the nation that they're entering.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.580
If only by virtue of the fact that they're doing it right now.

07:54.580 --> 07:58.360
As soon as Trudeau won his second election, he announced a pilot project to bring mass

07:58.360 --> 07:59.400
immigration to Canada.

07:59.400 --> 08:04.540
The cities that he selected for mass immigration are primarily places that are semi-isolated.

08:04.540 --> 08:08.940
They're further north than places like Toronto, they're colder, they're rougher industry-based

08:08.940 --> 08:09.940
cities.

08:09.940 --> 08:14.020
And, potentially unfortunately for me, my city is on the list.

08:14.020 --> 08:18.200
Let's see what some people who live in this city of mine think about this.

08:18.200 --> 08:22.240
And unfortunately, unlike in the UK where the working class north rose up against the

08:22.240 --> 08:25.600
far left, it seems like the people here are quite happy to see it happen.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
This is great.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.120
In a lot of cases immigrants make better, more compassionate neighbours than we are.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.180
A Syrian refugee owned restaurant downtown announced today they are feeding the homeless

08:34.180 --> 08:36.980
and the less fortunate between Christmas and New Years.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.440
I'm very much looking forward to more diversity up here.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.660
And you know what, I know exactly what Syrian refugee family he's talking about.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.660
I know the restaurant, I know the family.

08:44.660 --> 08:45.820
And yeah, they're good people.

08:45.820 --> 08:51.080
These were legitimate refugees who came to Canada because Syria was getting fucking destroyed.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.480
And you know what, they're actually starting to integrate.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.920
That would be the kind of immigrant I would be happy to have here.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.360
In a couple of generations, they will likely just be Canadians.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.700
Good, we're experiencing a pretty severe labour shortage.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.980
We need some new blood.

09:03.980 --> 09:07.840
So far my experiences with immigrants in Sudbury have been overwhelmingly positive.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.160
That and the fact that my grandparents immigrated to Sudbury, which is probably true of a great

09:11.160 --> 09:12.740
many Sudbrarians.

09:12.740 --> 09:14.980
And to be honest, I immigrated here.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.420
I mean I'm obviously Canadian, but I moved to this city.

09:17.420 --> 09:18.700
This is not my home city.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.360
And Sudbury is definitely a city of immigrants.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.180
It started as a mining town and it had to bring workers in from the outside.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.780
But here's the problem with the whole labour shortage thing.

09:26.780 --> 09:29.860
That means that companies need to start paying more for labour.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.100
It is in fact good for the worker since wages go up.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.620
But the price of labour is high.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.700
Do you know what mass immigration does?

09:36.700 --> 09:38.880
It drives wages down.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.580
If you're experiencing a pretty severe labour shortage, now is the time for you to make

09:42.580 --> 09:43.580
your money.

09:43.580 --> 09:46.940
Now is not the time to flood the city with a whole bunch of migrants who will work for

09:46.940 --> 09:47.940
pennies on the dollar.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.660
Then of course you get this person.

09:49.660 --> 09:50.660
Good.

09:50.660 --> 09:51.660
Get some much needed diversity.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.980
What do you mean much needed?

09:53.980 --> 09:56.740
Are the native Canadians here not good enough for you to hang out with?

09:56.740 --> 10:00.180
Sudbury is already a pretty big hodgepodge between the English speaking community, the

10:00.180 --> 10:02.800
French speaking community, and the Aboriginal community.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.640
Is that not diverse enough for you?

10:04.640 --> 10:09.820
Or does diversity mean London style acid attacks and machetes being swung around downtown?

10:09.820 --> 10:13.060
Was it a crisis or a tragedy when waves of Italian immigrants came here?

10:13.060 --> 10:14.060
Or Finns?

10:14.060 --> 10:15.060
Or Ukrainians?

10:15.060 --> 10:16.060
No.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.060
I agree it wasn't.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.060
Because they integrated.

10:18.060 --> 10:19.160
Because they integrated.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.760
They brought their expertise, they brought their work ethic, they brought their unique

10:21.760 --> 10:25.020
culture and they became Canadians.

10:25.020 --> 10:29.580
Islamic immigration is not the same as Italian or Finn or Ukrainian.

10:29.580 --> 10:33.820
Canada is bringing in immigrants from places that don't like the West.

10:33.820 --> 10:34.820
They don't like Canada.

10:34.820 --> 10:35.820
They don't like the States.

10:35.820 --> 10:36.820
They don't like the UK.

10:36.820 --> 10:40.160
And yeah, you know what, there are certainly going to be some immigrants like that Syrian

10:40.160 --> 10:42.920
family that I know who came here to escape the oppression.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.400
But how many terrorist cells do you think are coming in along with?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.140
Or hell, forget about the terrorist cells.

10:47.140 --> 10:50.580
How many people do you think are coming here to eventually agitate for Sharia law?

10:50.580 --> 10:53.560
And the reason that people here just aren't objecting the way they would in the UK or

10:53.560 --> 10:57.280
in the States is because of this idea that Canada is post-national.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.800
That there is no essential Canadianness.

10:59.800 --> 11:03.780
We are geographically and in some ways culturally very similar to America.

11:03.780 --> 11:07.860
But in other ways we're very much like continental Europe and I think it's to our detriment.

11:07.860 --> 11:11.860
To wrap a bow on this whole topic, we need to talk about the Laurentian Consensus.

11:11.860 --> 11:16.980
The Laurentian Consensus is basically the idea that most of Canada's political power

11:16.980 --> 11:21.860
is centered on cities that are along the St. Lawrence River and ever since the initial

11:21.860 --> 11:25.780
colonization by the British and the French, these locations have been the political heartland

11:25.780 --> 11:26.780
of Canada.

11:26.780 --> 11:30.020
However, in the past 50 years, things have began to wildly shift.

11:30.020 --> 11:34.300
The oil discoveries in Alberta and Newfoundland have drastically changed the politics of those

11:34.300 --> 11:35.300
locations.

11:35.300 --> 11:39.220
Asian immigration into British Columbia, a far more integrative form of immigration than

11:39.220 --> 11:44.780
say Islamic immigration into Toronto, has made the western provinces more Pacific oriented,

11:44.780 --> 11:47.540
turning them away fundamentally from the Laurentian Consensus.

11:47.540 --> 11:52.460
As early as 2011, political analysts have noticed that the Laurentian Consensus has

11:52.460 --> 11:55.500
been basically losing its clout within a united Canada.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.900
Trudeau himself comes from this class of people within Canadian society and as he governs

11:59.900 --> 12:02.620
Canada he does so with an Ontario-centric focus.

12:02.620 --> 12:07.340
I don't know if you guys have heard, but Canada is kind of on fire right now.

12:07.340 --> 12:11.060
Trudeau's mismanagement of the Alberta oil sands is coming into full view, British Columbia

12:11.060 --> 12:14.940
politics are simply alien to him, and the Maritimes have felt like they've been hung

12:14.940 --> 12:17.160
out to dry for the past 15 years.

12:17.160 --> 12:21.020
Let me read you this passage from this article, and if you're a Brit or you're an American,

12:21.020 --> 12:24.060
let me know if the person being described sounds familiar to you.

12:24.060 --> 12:28.860
Historically, the Laurentian elite were Upper Canadian Anglo-Protestants and Quebecois patricians,

12:28.860 --> 12:32.540
and their descendants still dominate the upper strata of politics, the bureaucracy,

12:32.540 --> 12:36.460
crown corporations and agencies, academia, and the media.

12:36.460 --> 12:41.020
Private sector membership tends towards legacy industries, often dominated by multi-generational

12:41.020 --> 12:42.020
families.

12:42.020 --> 12:45.820
The media, particularly the CBC, project the consensus across the country.

12:45.820 --> 12:50.140
The Laurentian elite members have remarkable mobility among the upper levels of Canada's

12:50.140 --> 12:51.980
government, business, and the bureaucracy.

12:51.980 --> 12:56.860
Today's Laurentian elite is also arguably our franchise of the mobile, transnational

12:56.860 --> 12:58.540
professional class.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.980
The Anywheres, as discussed in Stephen Harper's book.

13:00.980 --> 13:06.980
They are, according to Harper, urban and university-educated professionals who have become genuinely globally

13:06.980 --> 13:09.680
oriented in their careers and personal lives.

13:09.680 --> 13:15.100
As Anywheres, the Laurentians largely reflect the universal, broadly leftist monoculture.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.500
Their personal ethos is typically secular and socially progressive.

13:18.500 --> 13:24.140
Today, this includes much of the postmodern canon, intersectionality, quantifying privilege,

13:24.140 --> 13:26.980
and the seemingly incessant signaling of virtue.

13:26.980 --> 13:31.540
Economically, they range from socialist to corporatist, businessmen who actively seek

13:31.540 --> 13:35.020
advantage from deals with the government, while typically promoting the social progressive

13:35.020 --> 13:36.020
agenda.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.340
If you're a Brit, maybe that sounds like the London bubble.

13:38.340 --> 13:42.500
If you're an American, maybe it's Silicon Valley, Hollywood, or New York.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.700
Canada has it too.

13:43.700 --> 13:47.980
And these people would definitely be the type to say that there is no Canadian-ness.

13:47.980 --> 13:50.220
That my country has no core identity.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.660
That there's nothing special about it.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.700
That there's nothing uniquely British or uniquely Scandinavian.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.580
There's an advertisement, it's about 20 years old now.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.420
You can find it on YouTube, but it definitely looks like a video that's 20 years old.

13:59.420 --> 14:01.800
It was for the Canadian brand of beer.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.100
For those of you who don't know, it's literally just called Canadian.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.540
It's a great Canadian export.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.980
I guess we make good beer.

14:06.980 --> 14:11.100
And it was a Canadian person talking about all the things that he loves about Canada.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.500
And that was the pitch as to why you should buy this beer.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.480
Can you imagine this advertisement being made nowadays?

14:16.480 --> 14:21.220
In an era where somebody who wears the Union Jack as a suit gets thrown out of a bar in

14:21.220 --> 14:22.220
the UK.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.760
An era of open borders activism.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.300
And where any immigration policy makes you a racist.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.900
When a German politician waves a German flag and Angela Merkel decides to steal it from

14:30.900 --> 14:32.120
him and shake her head.

14:32.120 --> 14:36.660
When a very simple, very positive slogan, Make America Great Again, is considered the

14:36.660 --> 14:37.920
height of offense.

14:37.920 --> 14:42.140
The 20th century was a lesson in the dangers of blind nationalism.

14:42.140 --> 14:46.680
I can understand why some people might react to those horrors by trying to push the idea

14:46.680 --> 14:48.340
that there is no nation at all.

14:48.340 --> 14:51.180
But these people are what I like to call idiots.

14:51.180 --> 14:54.980
There can be a nationalism that is welcoming to all those who wish to adopt the nation's

14:54.980 --> 14:56.200
core values.

14:56.200 --> 15:00.760
There can be a nationalism that is not mindlessly prideful, but is instead grateful for what

15:00.760 --> 15:01.860
they have inherited.

15:01.860 --> 15:06.580
And means not only to iterate on it, but to synthesize it with like-minded individuals.

15:06.580 --> 15:11.880
There can be a Canadian nationalism that doesn't simply hate everything non-Canadian, but views

15:11.880 --> 15:16.380
the Americans, the British, the French, and any other nation that adopts the core values

15:16.380 --> 15:20.100
of individual freedom and human rights as old friends.

15:20.140 --> 15:24.380
Competing with them, yes, but fundamentally in the spirit of cooperation.

15:24.380 --> 15:29.060
Competition designed not to destroy your opponent, but to see what heights both you and they

15:29.060 --> 15:30.060
could reach.

15:30.060 --> 15:33.020
To me, that would be something fundamentally Canadian.

15:33.020 --> 15:35.060
That would be part of our core identity.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.940
No amount of radical leftist post-nationalism screeching will take that away.

15:38.940 --> 15:43.220
And I have a feeling that as long as they continue to screech, they're going to keep

15:43.220 --> 15:44.740
losing arguments.

15:44.740 --> 15:47.260
And more importantly, they're going to keep losing elections.
