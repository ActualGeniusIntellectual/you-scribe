0	10180	Good evening my friends. Well it's evening for me, it's gonna be morning for you when you see this.
10180	14220	I'm gonna be gone this weekend so I'm trying to record something quick just so there's something
14220	19980	for Sunday. I know Sunday is usually the weekly sip which is my weekly streaming show every Sunday
19980	24380	morning but this week I can't do it. I'm hoping that I can get this recorded and then it can be
24380	28560	edited and put out in time for at least some kind of content to come out on Sunday because I know
28620	32340	that it's been a little bit sparse recently but nonetheless I'm gonna be gone this weekend so no
32340	36860	weekly sip instead you get this video that I am basically recording last minute before I leave
36860	41100	for the weekend. In fact I might not even be back in time for the Warhammer tabletop campaign
41100	45960	happening over on Archer's channel. Hopefully I am but hey don't tell him okay? But because I am
45960	50280	a little bit time strapped I want to go over something that's kind of funny and goofy and I
50280	55020	think we can have a good laugh at. This was put up on the website of the University of Virginia live
55080	60960	and leftist twitch political live streaming and Hassan Piker. So what's happening here is
60960	69920	somebody's I think master's thesis is literally an analysis of the online left and how it relates
69920	77460	to how it relates to twitch. This has to be the most parasocial fucking thing I've seen in a while
77460	83600	I ain't making this up you can go and find this and here it is live and leftist Department of
83620	87680	Media Studies University of Virginia May 2022. You know hey good for him I never finished my
87680	94760	thesis so acknowledgments my parents advisor all the normal stuff that you see in a thesis my
94760	99740	classmates who have hopefully ignored me speaking at length about weird shit oh my god imagine like
99740	103500	you're in class and you're just trying to get through your get through school get through your
103500	108080	degrees you can get on with your life and this guy is just like ranting beside you in the lecture
108080	113780	hall about Hassan's latest antics my god University must be more insufferable than it was when I was
113780	120820	there to Hassan and chat for inspiring this paper has L I hope he sees this dude thanks to anyone
120820	125100	else who reads this hope you get something out of it I'm gonna get a lot out of it but I don't know
125100	131180	about anybody else leftist political live streaming has become an increasingly visible subset of
131180	137180	twitch.tv content and internet live streaming content generally with Hassan Hassan Abby
137180	142820	piker the most prominent among content creators in this new genre this thesis aims to understand
142820	147380	how leftist political live streaming fits into a historical lineage of partisan political
147380	152420	broadcasting from talk radio to present-day structures labor and generates income and how
152420	156920	its programming engages its audience through its use of technological affordances collective
156920	161200	effect and an integrated materialist analysis in the first chapter I traced the lineage of
161200	165240	twitches political streams I synthesized previous literature beginning with right-wing talk radio
165240	169940	stars like Russia Limbaugh on through television political media liberal infotainment online
169940	175040	gaming and online radicalism with this context I situate piker and other leftist political live
175040	179120	streamers in historical context outlining the cultural and technical affordances they draw
179120	183320	from legacy media in the second chapter I take a political economic approach of political live
183360	187720	streaming drawing on the statements of streamers public facing company policy and trade blogs I
187720	193160	first break down the way that both streamer and audience labor our audience labor are configured
193160	197200	on the platform building from that I analyze how twitch operates as a payment processor handling
197200	201340	and incentivizing transactions between audiences and content creators and finally I discuss how
201340	205700	twitch is able to exert political power over its users by gatekeeping their income producing a
205700	209240	chilling effect which affects political streamers coverage in the third chapter I described the
209240	213320	experience of a twitch streamer combining auto ethnography the walkthrough method and
213320	217640	computational text analysis I described the programming of the streams content itself in
217640	222240	its phenomenological and effective dimensions I use this description to show how political
222240	226400	discourse is shaped and received by sides of the streams communicative circuit if you ever needed
226400	232320	a fucking reason to think that academia has become entirely superfluous at least insofar as the arts
232320	238200	is concerned here you go here it is all right Jesus Christ oh my god there's so much garbage
238360	243440	here maybe we shouldn't go through all 61 pages of it but that's okay I have a few choice snippets
243440	247440	we can talk about what's interesting to me is that this thesis drops in the context of a son
247440	252600	recently doing a a pretty high-profile internet about his life in his career and how he got a job
252600	256840	at TYT because of his uncle chenk Uygur and how he ended up you know going on his own and becoming
256840	262800	a streamer and Hassan gives his his story but Hassan leaves out what actually made it all work
262800	268320	and that was destiny years ago Hassan was a destiny orbiter destiny platformed Hassan which
268320	274160	is what basically gave him the boost in an audience to get him going at the start Hassan
274160	278400	used to pile around with with destiny's friends and destiny's community and now that Hassan's made
278400	282440	he basically abandoned destiny and now he kind of hates destiny vosh did the same thing other
282440	287400	streamers have apparently done the same thing as well the the destiny bump seems to be a real thing
287400	290840	in the online streaming space at least for politics and the number of people who have
290880	295760	turned around after they've basically got big bigger than destiny and then backstabbed him
295760	300920	that list also seems to be growing and in that interview that Hassan gave to the mainstream
300920	306200	media he completely leaves out destiny's influence in fact he says that he was the first person to
306200	311560	merge politics and gaming and streams when it was in fact destiny the entire thing is basically this
311560	317160	weird rewriting of history and that's the thing about the process of legitimization as soon as one
317160	320720	organization whether that be a school or a government or a media organization or whatever
320720	326800	says something that is false is true and other legitimate organizations can point at that citation
326800	332080	and say look it's obviously the case right and so that lie can propagate and become legitimized
332080	337880	which is basically what happens in this thesis for example destiny is only mentioned twice in
337880	343720	this thesis once in passing and the second time in the conclusion where it reads while
343720	348280	piker may have frequently used his bullhorn thus far to advocate for anti-imperialism
348280	354520	anti-capitalism and marginalized voices others are already pivoting to other targets vosh who
354520	359840	has shown up throughout this thesis has regularly used his position to demonize decolonial advocates
359840	364920	on his live stream and the self-proclaimed neoliberal streamer destiny has made it a goal
364920	371160	to harass anyone to his left these sort of reactionary tendencies are supported through
371160	377800	the constant push for engagement and the drama that ensues is itself a lucrative market so this
377800	386600	seems to be an incorrect statement as far as I can tell because I do watch some destiny I do check in
386600	391680	on vosh every once in a while I don't really watch us on piker but basically I like to keep my thumb
391680	396920	on the pulse of a lot of these people even though I'm not in their communities and from what I can
396920	402920	tell I don't think destiny has made it a golden harass anyone to his left I think people on the
402920	410000	left are taking it that way mainly because destiny is very good at de-radicalizing people from far
410000	416040	left positions and in fact this thesis does outright ignore that destiny was the first
416040	421000	person to come in and mix politics and gaming on Twitch and then also start doing debates from the
421000	426080	left and then also start bumping up other streamers and helping platform them and helping them become
426280	431520	streamers in their own right like like vosh and asan this thesis ignores all of that while the
431520	436240	cause for leftist twitches rise in popularity can only be speculated on no we know what it is you're
436240	440040	just not saying it the growth of political audiences on the platform has continued along
440040	444600	with the growth of the platform beyond eSports and the growth of the popularity of live streaming
444600	449600	more broadly as with the coincidence of rush limbaugh's ascendance to talk radio stardom in
449600	454760	which the wider American political context in this formal novelty aligned perfectly for popular
454760	460520	success twitches lefties and asan piker especially seemed to have stumbled into success more than
460520	467200	initially seeking it out this this is actually describing destiny and then these other people
467200	473440	were bumped by him that's the actual truth here oh hey look at the bottom here at least this paper
473440	478360	still points out that YouTube doesn't actually have an alt-right pipeline the way that Xander
478360	482840	Hall thought it did you know that pipeline video of mine that I made that got Xander Hall's panties
482840	487620	in a bunch he did a reaction to it and then I went on Adam and Sitch on their weekly Sunday
487620	492600	show to to basically react to the reaction and Xander Hall was supposed to pop in but he he never
492600	496720	did that was some ridiculous drama that happened surrounding me too it was it was fucking stupid
496720	501760	what's really interesting though are some of these citations used in this thesis and no I don't mean
501760	508960	Karl Marx's 1978 work a contribution to the critique of political economy you might have
508960	513760	gotten the century wrong on that one dude I'm talking more about how this thesis just seems
513760	519280	to be a description of twitch drama like like check this out several other streamers were then
519280	523800	banned for discussing the controversy this is the the cracker thing where twitch banned use of the
523800	528640	word cracker as a slur including the white libertarian socialist vosh who had send the
528640	533400	who had said the n-word on stream previously piker had attributed the event's origin to a brigade of
533400	538680	white right-wing naysayers who put themselves into a frenzy and also fellow streamer vosh for example
538920	545600	takes neoliberal stances which uphold colonialist global capitalist and or reactionary paradigms
545600	550880	and he's able to persuade his audience by exerting his power as the arbiter of the stream a lot of
550880	555440	these comments specifically about vosh but also many other streamers in this thesis rely on this
555440	563880	quotation Samson 2022 and what he's referring to is this YouTube video Noah Sampson 2022 solving
563880	571280	the debate bro problem and here is that video by Noah Sampson this video is intended to document
571280	575120	the many problems that debate streamers are creating for the online left and the built-in
575120	580840	white supremacy which allows this to happen Noah Sampson's a fucking idiot whoa whoa whoa the cow
580840	586860	gee Jesus Howard Noah Sampson who said that he liked me in a video and then later posted like a
586860	591480	minute-long retraction in the following video I have no problem black craters getting really big
591480	603200	however FD signifier is a dump okay okay so this video is kind of a meme video on the left right
603200	610000	now and something that kraut actually predicted years ago would be that there would be a complete
610000	618920	and total collapse of lefty tube of the online leftist space after Trump left office and that
618920	626320	has happened you've got the more video sas lefty tubers like contra points like h bomber guy like
626320	633280	Lindsay Ellis and these people you know as bad as they can be sometimes they absolutely hate the
633280	638320	the lefty twitch politics crowd at the bread tubers and the reason seems to be as far as I
638320	644160	can tell is because the twitch politics crowd there are a bunch of dunning kruger dumbfucks
644160	651320	who rely on charisma and debates to make arguments rather than any kind of actual foundation in in
651320	657040	fact meanwhile the video essayists even though they are you know often wrong as well they can
657040	662160	at least pull out a book and read it and give you a theory and like outline something they're not
662160	667240	simply shooting from the hip all the time and right now in the far left internet space there
667240	674800	is a huge civil war happening between react bro streamers and the video essayists and then there's
674800	680440	also the ongoing civil war which I talked about and in previous videos I think a year or two ago
680440	685160	at this point between the socialists and the progressives where the progressives view socialists
685160	690560	as being racist and class reductionist for not taking into account other intersectional issues
690560	695760	the socialists view the progressives and the intersectionals as basically just being rad
695800	701040	libs who aren't really part of the left and that these localist issues regarding race or sex or
701040	706480	or culture are distracting from the socialist revolution and so there's this tension on the
706480	710400	left between these two groups that just they just don't fit together and they're constantly bashing
710400	715520	against each other and they're basically ripping the left apart at this point the whole vosh
715520	721560	contra points drama recently or the vosh cat black drama recently and now the Noah Sampson
721560	727720	video these are all just individual data points along this larger trend of the left basically
727720	733040	fracturing and on some level you know I don't care I'm not part of the left and whatever it
733040	737440	is kind of funny to watch but that's the extent of of my attachment to it but some people are
737440	742800	taking this very very very seriously because the same thing happened to the right on YouTube back
742800	748360	in like 2017 2018 where internet blood sports destroyed the whole fucking thing and now it's
748360	753120	happening to the left and I guess this fucking guy thought it was so goddamn important that he
753120	758880	had to write his master's thesis on it I'm here mostly just to laugh at it because it is kind of
758880	763800	ridiculous but let's just check out the conclusion real quick here despite its challenges live
763800	767720	streaming uniquely benefits the socialist position the leftist materialist analysis
767720	772200	it requires its practitioners to navigate liveness and all its sincerity and intimacy
772200	776400	Jesus how can you say so much without saying anything at all necessarily the arrangement
776400	779680	and dominant culture of live streaming hold streamers accountable to their audiences on
779680	784040	some level with direct methods of recourse or critique available when suspicion arises via
784040	788760	the chat this kind of pushback is common in political live streams with users asking questions
788760	793320	in both good and bad faith and getting responded to appropriately here's how I know that you're a
793320	798680	son simp because this is not what he uses his chat for if you criticize him he just bans you
798680	804960	right-wing and more esoteric ideologies are not equipped for liveness because they simply cannot
804960	812040	respond to the collective bullshit calling of a live co-constitutive audience capitalism and
812040	816760	rightism cannot explain away the contradictions of their own relations sufficiently because the
816760	822480	contradictions of material life there's that marks 1978 again under capitalism say otherwise
822480	827760	this to me explains why right-wing content flourished on YouTube and in other static
827760	833080	edited forms but is yet to really make its way to live stream beyond the fringes it cannot explain
833120	838080	itself without debate speak and editing meanwhile live streaming rewards the sincere those who can
838080	842160	take critique and either adapt or view or explain in sufficient terms it's failing I think it's
842160	846080	actually much more simple than that I think it's because these platforms ban right-wing people head
846080	851160	over to cozy TV you see the 5,000 viewers that Nick Fuentes has I don't like Nick Fuentes but
851160	856520	he's clearly on the far right and he clearly has a big audience and he streams all the fucking time
856520	862880	this person is literally seeing that all of the right-wing debate bros who can actually debate
862880	867720	because this fucking analysis that right-wing and more esoteric ideologies are not equipped
867720	872760	for liveness that's just like immense stupidity because all the actual right-wing debaters they've
872760	877880	been banned and every time a socialist actually has to debate a liberal who is knowledgeable about
877880	884520	socialism on socialism the socialist constantly fucking loses because socialism itself is this
884520	889200	incoherent mess of an ideology that can't ever actually happen it can't ever actually be held
889200	893560	together like I've watched destiny debate people I've watched Sargon debate people I've watched
893560	898680	econoboi debate people all like debate socialist I mean I've watched like a bunch of people who
898680	903720	are who are liberals and who are conservatives debate socialists and as long as the liberal or
903720	908480	conservative is knowledgeable about socialism the socialist loses every time because socialism is a
908480	914280	losing ideology this thesis unironically reads like a super Hassan simp who has never actually
914280	919920	noticed that when you ban non leftists they don't simply disappear from the internet they go to
919920	924120	other platforms and their audience continues to grow there anyway it's time for me to take off
924120	929200	hopefully this gets edited and put up on Sunday as I intend and I will see you guys next time
929200	931760	have a good one I love you
