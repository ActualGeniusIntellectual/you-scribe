00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180
Good evening my friends. Well it's evening for me, it's gonna be morning for you when you see this.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,220
I'm gonna be gone this weekend so I'm trying to record something quick just so there's something

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,980
for Sunday. I know Sunday is usually the weekly sip which is my weekly streaming show every Sunday

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,380
morning but this week I can't do it. I'm hoping that I can get this recorded and then it can be

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,560
edited and put out in time for at least some kind of content to come out on Sunday because I know

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,340
that it's been a little bit sparse recently but nonetheless I'm gonna be gone this weekend so no

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,860
weekly sip instead you get this video that I am basically recording last minute before I leave

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,100
for the weekend. In fact I might not even be back in time for the Warhammer tabletop campaign

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,960
happening over on Archer's channel. Hopefully I am but hey don't tell him okay? But because I am

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,280
a little bit time strapped I want to go over something that's kind of funny and goofy and I

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,020
think we can have a good laugh at. This was put up on the website of the University of Virginia live

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,960
and leftist twitch political live streaming and Hassan Piker. So what's happening here is

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:09,920
somebody's I think master's thesis is literally an analysis of the online left and how it relates

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,460
to how it relates to twitch. This has to be the most parasocial fucking thing I've seen in a while

15
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,600
I ain't making this up you can go and find this and here it is live and leftist Department of

16
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,680
Media Studies University of Virginia May 2022. You know hey good for him I never finished my

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,760
thesis so acknowledgments my parents advisor all the normal stuff that you see in a thesis my

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,740
classmates who have hopefully ignored me speaking at length about weird shit oh my god imagine like

19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,500
you're in class and you're just trying to get through your get through school get through your

20
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,080
degrees you can get on with your life and this guy is just like ranting beside you in the lecture

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,780
hall about Hassan's latest antics my god University must be more insufferable than it was when I was

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,820
there to Hassan and chat for inspiring this paper has L I hope he sees this dude thanks to anyone

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,100
else who reads this hope you get something out of it I'm gonna get a lot out of it but I don't know

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,180
about anybody else leftist political live streaming has become an increasingly visible subset of

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,180
twitch.tv content and internet live streaming content generally with Hassan Hassan Abby

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,820
piker the most prominent among content creators in this new genre this thesis aims to understand

27
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,380
how leftist political live streaming fits into a historical lineage of partisan political

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,420
broadcasting from talk radio to present-day structures labor and generates income and how

29
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,920
its programming engages its audience through its use of technological affordances collective

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,200
effect and an integrated materialist analysis in the first chapter I traced the lineage of

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,240
twitches political streams I synthesized previous literature beginning with right-wing talk radio

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,940
stars like Russia Limbaugh on through television political media liberal infotainment online

33
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,040
gaming and online radicalism with this context I situate piker and other leftist political live

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,120
streamers in historical context outlining the cultural and technical affordances they draw

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,320
from legacy media in the second chapter I take a political economic approach of political live

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,720
streaming drawing on the statements of streamers public facing company policy and trade blogs I

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,160
first break down the way that both streamer and audience labor our audience labor are configured

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,200
on the platform building from that I analyze how twitch operates as a payment processor handling

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,340
and incentivizing transactions between audiences and content creators and finally I discuss how

40
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,700
twitch is able to exert political power over its users by gatekeeping their income producing a

41
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,240
chilling effect which affects political streamers coverage in the third chapter I described the

42
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,320
experience of a twitch streamer combining auto ethnography the walkthrough method and

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,640
computational text analysis I described the programming of the streams content itself in

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,240
its phenomenological and effective dimensions I use this description to show how political

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,400
discourse is shaped and received by sides of the streams communicative circuit if you ever needed

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,320
a fucking reason to think that academia has become entirely superfluous at least insofar as the arts

47
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,200
is concerned here you go here it is all right Jesus Christ oh my god there's so much garbage

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,440
here maybe we shouldn't go through all 61 pages of it but that's okay I have a few choice snippets

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,440
we can talk about what's interesting to me is that this thesis drops in the context of a son

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,600
recently doing a a pretty high-profile internet about his life in his career and how he got a job

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,840
at TYT because of his uncle chenk Uygur and how he ended up you know going on his own and becoming

52
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,800
a streamer and Hassan gives his his story but Hassan leaves out what actually made it all work

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,320
and that was destiny years ago Hassan was a destiny orbiter destiny platformed Hassan which

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,160
is what basically gave him the boost in an audience to get him going at the start Hassan

55
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
used to pile around with with destiny's friends and destiny's community and now that Hassan's made

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,440
he basically abandoned destiny and now he kind of hates destiny vosh did the same thing other

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,400
streamers have apparently done the same thing as well the the destiny bump seems to be a real thing

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,840
in the online streaming space at least for politics and the number of people who have

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,760
turned around after they've basically got big bigger than destiny and then backstabbed him

60
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,920
that list also seems to be growing and in that interview that Hassan gave to the mainstream

61
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,200
media he completely leaves out destiny's influence in fact he says that he was the first person to

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,560
merge politics and gaming and streams when it was in fact destiny the entire thing is basically this

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,160
weird rewriting of history and that's the thing about the process of legitimization as soon as one

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,720
organization whether that be a school or a government or a media organization or whatever

65
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,800
says something that is false is true and other legitimate organizations can point at that citation

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,080
and say look it's obviously the case right and so that lie can propagate and become legitimized

67
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,880
which is basically what happens in this thesis for example destiny is only mentioned twice in

68
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,720
this thesis once in passing and the second time in the conclusion where it reads while

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,280
piker may have frequently used his bullhorn thus far to advocate for anti-imperialism

70
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,520
anti-capitalism and marginalized voices others are already pivoting to other targets vosh who

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,840
has shown up throughout this thesis has regularly used his position to demonize decolonial advocates

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,920
on his live stream and the self-proclaimed neoliberal streamer destiny has made it a goal

73
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,160
to harass anyone to his left these sort of reactionary tendencies are supported through

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,800
the constant push for engagement and the drama that ensues is itself a lucrative market so this

75
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:26,600
seems to be an incorrect statement as far as I can tell because I do watch some destiny I do check in

76
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,680
on vosh every once in a while I don't really watch us on piker but basically I like to keep my thumb

77
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,920
on the pulse of a lot of these people even though I'm not in their communities and from what I can

78
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,920
tell I don't think destiny has made it a golden harass anyone to his left I think people on the

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:50,000
left are taking it that way mainly because destiny is very good at de-radicalizing people from far

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,040
left positions and in fact this thesis does outright ignore that destiny was the first

81
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,000
person to come in and mix politics and gaming on Twitch and then also start doing debates from the

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,080
left and then also start bumping up other streamers and helping platform them and helping them become

83
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,520
streamers in their own right like like vosh and asan this thesis ignores all of that while the

84
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,240
cause for leftist twitches rise in popularity can only be speculated on no we know what it is you're

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,040
just not saying it the growth of political audiences on the platform has continued along

86
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,600
with the growth of the platform beyond eSports and the growth of the popularity of live streaming

87
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,600
more broadly as with the coincidence of rush limbaugh's ascendance to talk radio stardom in

88
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,760
which the wider American political context in this formal novelty aligned perfectly for popular

89
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,520
success twitches lefties and asan piker especially seemed to have stumbled into success more than

90
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,200
initially seeking it out this this is actually describing destiny and then these other people

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,440
were bumped by him that's the actual truth here oh hey look at the bottom here at least this paper

92
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,360
still points out that YouTube doesn't actually have an alt-right pipeline the way that Xander

93
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,840
Hall thought it did you know that pipeline video of mine that I made that got Xander Hall's panties

94
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,620
in a bunch he did a reaction to it and then I went on Adam and Sitch on their weekly Sunday

95
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,600
show to to basically react to the reaction and Xander Hall was supposed to pop in but he he never

96
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,720
did that was some ridiculous drama that happened surrounding me too it was it was fucking stupid

97
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,760
what's really interesting though are some of these citations used in this thesis and no I don't mean

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,960
Karl Marx's 1978 work a contribution to the critique of political economy you might have

99
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,760
gotten the century wrong on that one dude I'm talking more about how this thesis just seems

100
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,280
to be a description of twitch drama like like check this out several other streamers were then

101
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,800
banned for discussing the controversy this is the the cracker thing where twitch banned use of the

102
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,640
word cracker as a slur including the white libertarian socialist vosh who had send the

103
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,400
who had said the n-word on stream previously piker had attributed the event's origin to a brigade of

104
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,680
white right-wing naysayers who put themselves into a frenzy and also fellow streamer vosh for example

105
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,600
takes neoliberal stances which uphold colonialist global capitalist and or reactionary paradigms

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,880
and he's able to persuade his audience by exerting his power as the arbiter of the stream a lot of

107
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,440
these comments specifically about vosh but also many other streamers in this thesis rely on this

108
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:23,880
quotation Samson 2022 and what he's referring to is this YouTube video Noah Sampson 2022 solving

109
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,280
the debate bro problem and here is that video by Noah Sampson this video is intended to document

110
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,120
the many problems that debate streamers are creating for the online left and the built-in

111
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,840
white supremacy which allows this to happen Noah Sampson's a fucking idiot whoa whoa whoa the cow

112
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,860
gee Jesus Howard Noah Sampson who said that he liked me in a video and then later posted like a

113
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,480
minute-long retraction in the following video I have no problem black craters getting really big

114
00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:03,200
however FD signifier is a dump okay okay so this video is kind of a meme video on the left right

115
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,000
now and something that kraut actually predicted years ago would be that there would be a complete

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,920
and total collapse of lefty tube of the online leftist space after Trump left office and that

117
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,320
has happened you've got the more video sas lefty tubers like contra points like h bomber guy like

118
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,280
Lindsay Ellis and these people you know as bad as they can be sometimes they absolutely hate the

119
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,320
the lefty twitch politics crowd at the bread tubers and the reason seems to be as far as I

120
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,160
can tell is because the twitch politics crowd there are a bunch of dunning kruger dumbfucks

121
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,320
who rely on charisma and debates to make arguments rather than any kind of actual foundation in in

122
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,040
fact meanwhile the video essayists even though they are you know often wrong as well they can

123
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,160
at least pull out a book and read it and give you a theory and like outline something they're not

124
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,240
simply shooting from the hip all the time and right now in the far left internet space there

125
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:14,800
is a huge civil war happening between react bro streamers and the video essayists and then there's

126
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,440
also the ongoing civil war which I talked about and in previous videos I think a year or two ago

127
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,160
at this point between the socialists and the progressives where the progressives view socialists

128
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,560
as being racist and class reductionist for not taking into account other intersectional issues

129
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,760
the socialists view the progressives and the intersectionals as basically just being rad

130
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,040
libs who aren't really part of the left and that these localist issues regarding race or sex or

131
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,480
or culture are distracting from the socialist revolution and so there's this tension on the

132
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,400
left between these two groups that just they just don't fit together and they're constantly bashing

133
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,520
against each other and they're basically ripping the left apart at this point the whole vosh

134
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,560
contra points drama recently or the vosh cat black drama recently and now the Noah Sampson

135
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,720
video these are all just individual data points along this larger trend of the left basically

136
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,040
fracturing and on some level you know I don't care I'm not part of the left and whatever it

137
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,440
is kind of funny to watch but that's the extent of of my attachment to it but some people are

138
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,800
taking this very very very seriously because the same thing happened to the right on YouTube back

139
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,360
in like 2017 2018 where internet blood sports destroyed the whole fucking thing and now it's

140
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,120
happening to the left and I guess this fucking guy thought it was so goddamn important that he

141
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,880
had to write his master's thesis on it I'm here mostly just to laugh at it because it is kind of

142
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,800
ridiculous but let's just check out the conclusion real quick here despite its challenges live

143
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,720
streaming uniquely benefits the socialist position the leftist materialist analysis

144
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,200
it requires its practitioners to navigate liveness and all its sincerity and intimacy

145
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,400
Jesus how can you say so much without saying anything at all necessarily the arrangement

146
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,680
and dominant culture of live streaming hold streamers accountable to their audiences on

147
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,040
some level with direct methods of recourse or critique available when suspicion arises via

148
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,760
the chat this kind of pushback is common in political live streams with users asking questions

149
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,320
in both good and bad faith and getting responded to appropriately here's how I know that you're a

150
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,680
son simp because this is not what he uses his chat for if you criticize him he just bans you

151
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,960
right-wing and more esoteric ideologies are not equipped for liveness because they simply cannot

152
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:32,040
respond to the collective bullshit calling of a live co-constitutive audience capitalism and

153
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,760
rightism cannot explain away the contradictions of their own relations sufficiently because the

154
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,480
contradictions of material life there's that marks 1978 again under capitalism say otherwise

155
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,760
this to me explains why right-wing content flourished on YouTube and in other static

156
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,080
edited forms but is yet to really make its way to live stream beyond the fringes it cannot explain

157
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,080
itself without debate speak and editing meanwhile live streaming rewards the sincere those who can

158
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,160
take critique and either adapt or view or explain in sufficient terms it's failing I think it's

159
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,080
actually much more simple than that I think it's because these platforms ban right-wing people head

160
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,160
over to cozy TV you see the 5,000 viewers that Nick Fuentes has I don't like Nick Fuentes but

161
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,520
he's clearly on the far right and he clearly has a big audience and he streams all the fucking time

162
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,880
this person is literally seeing that all of the right-wing debate bros who can actually debate

163
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,720
because this fucking analysis that right-wing and more esoteric ideologies are not equipped

164
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,760
for liveness that's just like immense stupidity because all the actual right-wing debaters they've

165
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,880
been banned and every time a socialist actually has to debate a liberal who is knowledgeable about

166
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,520
socialism on socialism the socialist constantly fucking loses because socialism itself is this

167
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,200
incoherent mess of an ideology that can't ever actually happen it can't ever actually be held

168
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,560
together like I've watched destiny debate people I've watched Sargon debate people I've watched

169
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,680
econoboi debate people all like debate socialist I mean I've watched like a bunch of people who

170
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,720
are who are liberals and who are conservatives debate socialists and as long as the liberal or

171
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,480
conservative is knowledgeable about socialism the socialist loses every time because socialism is a

172
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,280
losing ideology this thesis unironically reads like a super Hassan simp who has never actually

173
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,920
noticed that when you ban non leftists they don't simply disappear from the internet they go to

174
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,120
other platforms and their audience continues to grow there anyway it's time for me to take off

175
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,200
hopefully this gets edited and put up on Sunday as I intend and I will see you guys next time

176
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,760
have a good one I love you
