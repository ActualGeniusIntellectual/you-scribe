00:00.000 --> 00:10.180
Good evening my friends. Well it's evening for me, it's gonna be morning for you when you see this.

00:10.180 --> 00:14.220
I'm gonna be gone this weekend so I'm trying to record something quick just so there's something

00:14.220 --> 00:19.980
for Sunday. I know Sunday is usually the weekly sip which is my weekly streaming show every Sunday

00:19.980 --> 00:24.380
morning but this week I can't do it. I'm hoping that I can get this recorded and then it can be

00:24.380 --> 00:28.560
edited and put out in time for at least some kind of content to come out on Sunday because I know

00:28.620 --> 00:32.340
that it's been a little bit sparse recently but nonetheless I'm gonna be gone this weekend so no

00:32.340 --> 00:36.860
weekly sip instead you get this video that I am basically recording last minute before I leave

00:36.860 --> 00:41.100
for the weekend. In fact I might not even be back in time for the Warhammer tabletop campaign

00:41.100 --> 00:45.960
happening over on Archer's channel. Hopefully I am but hey don't tell him okay? But because I am

00:45.960 --> 00:50.280
a little bit time strapped I want to go over something that's kind of funny and goofy and I

00:50.280 --> 00:55.020
think we can have a good laugh at. This was put up on the website of the University of Virginia live

00:55.080 --> 01:00.960
and leftist twitch political live streaming and Hassan Piker. So what's happening here is

01:00.960 --> 01:09.920
somebody's I think master's thesis is literally an analysis of the online left and how it relates

01:09.920 --> 01:17.460
to how it relates to twitch. This has to be the most parasocial fucking thing I've seen in a while

01:17.460 --> 01:23.600
I ain't making this up you can go and find this and here it is live and leftist Department of

01:23.620 --> 01:27.680
Media Studies University of Virginia May 2022. You know hey good for him I never finished my

01:27.680 --> 01:34.760
thesis so acknowledgments my parents advisor all the normal stuff that you see in a thesis my

01:34.760 --> 01:39.740
classmates who have hopefully ignored me speaking at length about weird shit oh my god imagine like

01:39.740 --> 01:43.500
you're in class and you're just trying to get through your get through school get through your

01:43.500 --> 01:48.080
degrees you can get on with your life and this guy is just like ranting beside you in the lecture

01:48.080 --> 01:53.780
hall about Hassan's latest antics my god University must be more insufferable than it was when I was

01:53.780 --> 02:00.820
there to Hassan and chat for inspiring this paper has L I hope he sees this dude thanks to anyone

02:00.820 --> 02:05.100
else who reads this hope you get something out of it I'm gonna get a lot out of it but I don't know

02:05.100 --> 02:11.180
about anybody else leftist political live streaming has become an increasingly visible subset of

02:11.180 --> 02:17.180
twitch.tv content and internet live streaming content generally with Hassan Hassan Abby

02:17.180 --> 02:22.820
piker the most prominent among content creators in this new genre this thesis aims to understand

02:22.820 --> 02:27.380
how leftist political live streaming fits into a historical lineage of partisan political

02:27.380 --> 02:32.420
broadcasting from talk radio to present-day structures labor and generates income and how

02:32.420 --> 02:36.920
its programming engages its audience through its use of technological affordances collective

02:36.920 --> 02:41.200
effect and an integrated materialist analysis in the first chapter I traced the lineage of

02:41.200 --> 02:45.240
twitches political streams I synthesized previous literature beginning with right-wing talk radio

02:45.240 --> 02:49.940
stars like Russia Limbaugh on through television political media liberal infotainment online

02:49.940 --> 02:55.040
gaming and online radicalism with this context I situate piker and other leftist political live

02:55.040 --> 02:59.120
streamers in historical context outlining the cultural and technical affordances they draw

02:59.120 --> 03:03.320
from legacy media in the second chapter I take a political economic approach of political live

03:03.360 --> 03:07.720
streaming drawing on the statements of streamers public facing company policy and trade blogs I

03:07.720 --> 03:13.160
first break down the way that both streamer and audience labor our audience labor are configured

03:13.160 --> 03:17.200
on the platform building from that I analyze how twitch operates as a payment processor handling

03:17.200 --> 03:21.340
and incentivizing transactions between audiences and content creators and finally I discuss how

03:21.340 --> 03:25.700
twitch is able to exert political power over its users by gatekeeping their income producing a

03:25.700 --> 03:29.240
chilling effect which affects political streamers coverage in the third chapter I described the

03:29.240 --> 03:33.320
experience of a twitch streamer combining auto ethnography the walkthrough method and

03:33.320 --> 03:37.640
computational text analysis I described the programming of the streams content itself in

03:37.640 --> 03:42.240
its phenomenological and effective dimensions I use this description to show how political

03:42.240 --> 03:46.400
discourse is shaped and received by sides of the streams communicative circuit if you ever needed

03:46.400 --> 03:52.320
a fucking reason to think that academia has become entirely superfluous at least insofar as the arts

03:52.320 --> 03:58.200
is concerned here you go here it is all right Jesus Christ oh my god there's so much garbage

03:58.360 --> 04:03.440
here maybe we shouldn't go through all 61 pages of it but that's okay I have a few choice snippets

04:03.440 --> 04:07.440
we can talk about what's interesting to me is that this thesis drops in the context of a son

04:07.440 --> 04:12.600
recently doing a a pretty high-profile internet about his life in his career and how he got a job

04:12.600 --> 04:16.840
at TYT because of his uncle chenk Uygur and how he ended up you know going on his own and becoming

04:16.840 --> 04:22.800
a streamer and Hassan gives his his story but Hassan leaves out what actually made it all work

04:22.800 --> 04:28.320
and that was destiny years ago Hassan was a destiny orbiter destiny platformed Hassan which

04:28.320 --> 04:34.160
is what basically gave him the boost in an audience to get him going at the start Hassan

04:34.160 --> 04:38.400
used to pile around with with destiny's friends and destiny's community and now that Hassan's made

04:38.400 --> 04:42.440
he basically abandoned destiny and now he kind of hates destiny vosh did the same thing other

04:42.440 --> 04:47.400
streamers have apparently done the same thing as well the the destiny bump seems to be a real thing

04:47.400 --> 04:50.840
in the online streaming space at least for politics and the number of people who have

04:50.880 --> 04:55.760
turned around after they've basically got big bigger than destiny and then backstabbed him

04:55.760 --> 05:00.920
that list also seems to be growing and in that interview that Hassan gave to the mainstream

05:00.920 --> 05:06.200
media he completely leaves out destiny's influence in fact he says that he was the first person to

05:06.200 --> 05:11.560
merge politics and gaming and streams when it was in fact destiny the entire thing is basically this

05:11.560 --> 05:17.160
weird rewriting of history and that's the thing about the process of legitimization as soon as one

05:17.160 --> 05:20.720
organization whether that be a school or a government or a media organization or whatever

05:20.720 --> 05:26.800
says something that is false is true and other legitimate organizations can point at that citation

05:26.800 --> 05:32.080
and say look it's obviously the case right and so that lie can propagate and become legitimized

05:32.080 --> 05:37.880
which is basically what happens in this thesis for example destiny is only mentioned twice in

05:37.880 --> 05:43.720
this thesis once in passing and the second time in the conclusion where it reads while

05:43.720 --> 05:48.280
piker may have frequently used his bullhorn thus far to advocate for anti-imperialism

05:48.280 --> 05:54.520
anti-capitalism and marginalized voices others are already pivoting to other targets vosh who

05:54.520 --> 05:59.840
has shown up throughout this thesis has regularly used his position to demonize decolonial advocates

05:59.840 --> 06:04.920
on his live stream and the self-proclaimed neoliberal streamer destiny has made it a goal

06:04.920 --> 06:11.160
to harass anyone to his left these sort of reactionary tendencies are supported through

06:11.160 --> 06:17.800
the constant push for engagement and the drama that ensues is itself a lucrative market so this

06:17.800 --> 06:26.600
seems to be an incorrect statement as far as I can tell because I do watch some destiny I do check in

06:26.600 --> 06:31.680
on vosh every once in a while I don't really watch us on piker but basically I like to keep my thumb

06:31.680 --> 06:36.920
on the pulse of a lot of these people even though I'm not in their communities and from what I can

06:36.920 --> 06:42.920
tell I don't think destiny has made it a golden harass anyone to his left I think people on the

06:42.920 --> 06:50.000
left are taking it that way mainly because destiny is very good at de-radicalizing people from far

06:50.000 --> 06:56.040
left positions and in fact this thesis does outright ignore that destiny was the first

06:56.040 --> 07:01.000
person to come in and mix politics and gaming on Twitch and then also start doing debates from the

07:01.000 --> 07:06.080
left and then also start bumping up other streamers and helping platform them and helping them become

07:06.280 --> 07:11.520
streamers in their own right like like vosh and asan this thesis ignores all of that while the

07:11.520 --> 07:16.240
cause for leftist twitches rise in popularity can only be speculated on no we know what it is you're

07:16.240 --> 07:20.040
just not saying it the growth of political audiences on the platform has continued along

07:20.040 --> 07:24.600
with the growth of the platform beyond eSports and the growth of the popularity of live streaming

07:24.600 --> 07:29.600
more broadly as with the coincidence of rush limbaugh's ascendance to talk radio stardom in

07:29.600 --> 07:34.760
which the wider American political context in this formal novelty aligned perfectly for popular

07:34.760 --> 07:40.520
success twitches lefties and asan piker especially seemed to have stumbled into success more than

07:40.520 --> 07:47.200
initially seeking it out this this is actually describing destiny and then these other people

07:47.200 --> 07:53.440
were bumped by him that's the actual truth here oh hey look at the bottom here at least this paper

07:53.440 --> 07:58.360
still points out that YouTube doesn't actually have an alt-right pipeline the way that Xander

07:58.360 --> 08:02.840
Hall thought it did you know that pipeline video of mine that I made that got Xander Hall's panties

08:02.840 --> 08:07.620
in a bunch he did a reaction to it and then I went on Adam and Sitch on their weekly Sunday

08:07.620 --> 08:12.600
show to to basically react to the reaction and Xander Hall was supposed to pop in but he he never

08:12.600 --> 08:16.720
did that was some ridiculous drama that happened surrounding me too it was it was fucking stupid

08:16.720 --> 08:21.760
what's really interesting though are some of these citations used in this thesis and no I don't mean

08:21.760 --> 08:28.960
Karl Marx's 1978 work a contribution to the critique of political economy you might have

08:28.960 --> 08:33.760
gotten the century wrong on that one dude I'm talking more about how this thesis just seems

08:33.760 --> 08:39.280
to be a description of twitch drama like like check this out several other streamers were then

08:39.280 --> 08:43.800
banned for discussing the controversy this is the the cracker thing where twitch banned use of the

08:43.800 --> 08:48.640
word cracker as a slur including the white libertarian socialist vosh who had send the

08:48.640 --> 08:53.400
who had said the n-word on stream previously piker had attributed the event's origin to a brigade of

08:53.400 --> 08:58.680
white right-wing naysayers who put themselves into a frenzy and also fellow streamer vosh for example

08:58.920 --> 09:05.600
takes neoliberal stances which uphold colonialist global capitalist and or reactionary paradigms

09:05.600 --> 09:10.880
and he's able to persuade his audience by exerting his power as the arbiter of the stream a lot of

09:10.880 --> 09:15.440
these comments specifically about vosh but also many other streamers in this thesis rely on this

09:15.440 --> 09:23.880
quotation Samson 2022 and what he's referring to is this YouTube video Noah Sampson 2022 solving

09:23.880 --> 09:31.280
the debate bro problem and here is that video by Noah Sampson this video is intended to document

09:31.280 --> 09:35.120
the many problems that debate streamers are creating for the online left and the built-in

09:35.120 --> 09:40.840
white supremacy which allows this to happen Noah Sampson's a fucking idiot whoa whoa whoa the cow

09:40.840 --> 09:46.860
gee Jesus Howard Noah Sampson who said that he liked me in a video and then later posted like a

09:46.860 --> 09:51.480
minute-long retraction in the following video I have no problem black craters getting really big

09:51.480 --> 10:03.200
however FD signifier is a dump okay okay so this video is kind of a meme video on the left right

10:03.200 --> 10:10.000
now and something that kraut actually predicted years ago would be that there would be a complete

10:10.000 --> 10:18.920
and total collapse of lefty tube of the online leftist space after Trump left office and that

10:18.920 --> 10:26.320
has happened you've got the more video sas lefty tubers like contra points like h bomber guy like

10:26.320 --> 10:33.280
Lindsay Ellis and these people you know as bad as they can be sometimes they absolutely hate the

10:33.280 --> 10:38.320
the lefty twitch politics crowd at the bread tubers and the reason seems to be as far as I

10:38.320 --> 10:44.160
can tell is because the twitch politics crowd there are a bunch of dunning kruger dumbfucks

10:44.160 --> 10:51.320
who rely on charisma and debates to make arguments rather than any kind of actual foundation in in

10:51.320 --> 10:57.040
fact meanwhile the video essayists even though they are you know often wrong as well they can

10:57.040 --> 11:02.160
at least pull out a book and read it and give you a theory and like outline something they're not

11:02.160 --> 11:07.240
simply shooting from the hip all the time and right now in the far left internet space there

11:07.240 --> 11:14.800
is a huge civil war happening between react bro streamers and the video essayists and then there's

11:14.800 --> 11:20.440
also the ongoing civil war which I talked about and in previous videos I think a year or two ago

11:20.440 --> 11:25.160
at this point between the socialists and the progressives where the progressives view socialists

11:25.160 --> 11:30.560
as being racist and class reductionist for not taking into account other intersectional issues

11:30.560 --> 11:35.760
the socialists view the progressives and the intersectionals as basically just being rad

11:35.800 --> 11:41.040
libs who aren't really part of the left and that these localist issues regarding race or sex or

11:41.040 --> 11:46.480
or culture are distracting from the socialist revolution and so there's this tension on the

11:46.480 --> 11:50.400
left between these two groups that just they just don't fit together and they're constantly bashing

11:50.400 --> 11:55.520
against each other and they're basically ripping the left apart at this point the whole vosh

11:55.520 --> 12:01.560
contra points drama recently or the vosh cat black drama recently and now the Noah Sampson

12:01.560 --> 12:07.720
video these are all just individual data points along this larger trend of the left basically

12:07.720 --> 12:13.040
fracturing and on some level you know I don't care I'm not part of the left and whatever it

12:13.040 --> 12:17.440
is kind of funny to watch but that's the extent of of my attachment to it but some people are

12:17.440 --> 12:22.800
taking this very very very seriously because the same thing happened to the right on YouTube back

12:22.800 --> 12:28.360
in like 2017 2018 where internet blood sports destroyed the whole fucking thing and now it's

12:28.360 --> 12:33.120
happening to the left and I guess this fucking guy thought it was so goddamn important that he

12:33.120 --> 12:38.880
had to write his master's thesis on it I'm here mostly just to laugh at it because it is kind of

12:38.880 --> 12:43.800
ridiculous but let's just check out the conclusion real quick here despite its challenges live

12:43.800 --> 12:47.720
streaming uniquely benefits the socialist position the leftist materialist analysis

12:47.720 --> 12:52.200
it requires its practitioners to navigate liveness and all its sincerity and intimacy

12:52.200 --> 12:56.400
Jesus how can you say so much without saying anything at all necessarily the arrangement

12:56.400 --> 12:59.680
and dominant culture of live streaming hold streamers accountable to their audiences on

12:59.680 --> 13:04.040
some level with direct methods of recourse or critique available when suspicion arises via

13:04.040 --> 13:08.760
the chat this kind of pushback is common in political live streams with users asking questions

13:08.760 --> 13:13.320
in both good and bad faith and getting responded to appropriately here's how I know that you're a

13:13.320 --> 13:18.680
son simp because this is not what he uses his chat for if you criticize him he just bans you

13:18.680 --> 13:24.960
right-wing and more esoteric ideologies are not equipped for liveness because they simply cannot

13:24.960 --> 13:32.040
respond to the collective bullshit calling of a live co-constitutive audience capitalism and

13:32.040 --> 13:36.760
rightism cannot explain away the contradictions of their own relations sufficiently because the

13:36.760 --> 13:42.480
contradictions of material life there's that marks 1978 again under capitalism say otherwise

13:42.480 --> 13:47.760
this to me explains why right-wing content flourished on YouTube and in other static

13:47.760 --> 13:53.080
edited forms but is yet to really make its way to live stream beyond the fringes it cannot explain

13:53.120 --> 13:58.080
itself without debate speak and editing meanwhile live streaming rewards the sincere those who can

13:58.080 --> 14:02.160
take critique and either adapt or view or explain in sufficient terms it's failing I think it's

14:02.160 --> 14:06.080
actually much more simple than that I think it's because these platforms ban right-wing people head

14:06.080 --> 14:11.160
over to cozy TV you see the 5,000 viewers that Nick Fuentes has I don't like Nick Fuentes but

14:11.160 --> 14:16.520
he's clearly on the far right and he clearly has a big audience and he streams all the fucking time

14:16.520 --> 14:22.880
this person is literally seeing that all of the right-wing debate bros who can actually debate

14:22.880 --> 14:27.720
because this fucking analysis that right-wing and more esoteric ideologies are not equipped

14:27.720 --> 14:32.760
for liveness that's just like immense stupidity because all the actual right-wing debaters they've

14:32.760 --> 14:37.880
been banned and every time a socialist actually has to debate a liberal who is knowledgeable about

14:37.880 --> 14:44.520
socialism on socialism the socialist constantly fucking loses because socialism itself is this

14:44.520 --> 14:49.200
incoherent mess of an ideology that can't ever actually happen it can't ever actually be held

14:49.200 --> 14:53.560
together like I've watched destiny debate people I've watched Sargon debate people I've watched

14:53.560 --> 14:58.680
econoboi debate people all like debate socialist I mean I've watched like a bunch of people who

14:58.680 --> 15:03.720
are who are liberals and who are conservatives debate socialists and as long as the liberal or

15:03.720 --> 15:08.480
conservative is knowledgeable about socialism the socialist loses every time because socialism is a

15:08.480 --> 15:14.280
losing ideology this thesis unironically reads like a super Hassan simp who has never actually

15:14.280 --> 15:19.920
noticed that when you ban non leftists they don't simply disappear from the internet they go to

15:19.920 --> 15:24.120
other platforms and their audience continues to grow there anyway it's time for me to take off

15:24.120 --> 15:29.200
hopefully this gets edited and put up on Sunday as I intend and I will see you guys next time

15:29.200 --> 15:31.760
have a good one I love you
