0	8640	There's this Twitter account that I follow called Antifa Watch.
8640	11720	They do pretty much what their name suggests, and I noticed yesterday that they put this
11720	12720	tweet out.
12720	16000	There was some sort of hostage situation, and one person is dead at the home of the
16000	20980	black supremacist communist organization known as the Black Hammer in Fayetteville, Georgia.
20980	25440	The attached images are of a Facebook stream by Gazi Kodzo titled Still Outside with the
25440	27840	Feds, and a post saying, they killed my son.
27840	31500	The news article linked, however, said that the man who was found dead at the location
31500	35900	was not killed by the police, as Kodzo's post suggested, but instead was self-inflicted.
35900	39100	Before we get into the details of this specific event, though, we've got to talk about that
39100	43160	black supremacist communist organization, the Black Hammer, and its leader, Gazi Kodzo.
43160	46880	I think I might have spoken about these guys before, maybe in the context of CHAZ.
46880	49720	They weren't a part of CHAZ, but they've also tried to set up similar communes several
49720	50720	times over the years.
50720	52440	In any case, let's go back to the beginning.
52440	57000	Gazi Kodzo's legal name is Augustus Claudius Romaine Jr., and despite the Black Hammer
57000	61640	only being formed in 2019, this guy's been around for a long time under the YouTube name
61640	62640	Smile Tone.
62640	66920	The Smile Tone YouTube channel has been rebranded to fit the current Black Hammer project, but
66920	70980	if you scroll back far enough, there's content from as early as 2014 dealing with racial
70980	72480	and social justice.
72480	76840	It's very bedroom feminist type stuff that was popular during that era of YouTube.
76840	80620	Everything from before his activism, however, has been scrubbed off the internet, but remember,
80620	81620	the internet never forgets.
81620	82620	Hey, y'all.
82620	83620	It's me, Smile Tone.
83620	89220	And today, we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about
89220	92340	Steve Jobs, and I'm going to tell you why I hate him.
92340	96220	Reason number one is he's a modern day Wizard of Oz, okay?
96220	101140	He promises you guys that he has all the answers and all the best technology, but behind all
101140	104700	that smoke and mirrors, he's nothing but an idiot selling to idiots.
104700	108300	Yeah, before getting into politics, this guy tried to basically do whatever he could to
108300	112700	get YouTube fame, including talking about tech or video games or whatever else, as well
112780	116380	as crossovers with other normie-type YouTubers to try and grow his audience.
116380	117380	Hey, guys.
117380	118380	What's up?
118380	121380	We're the Wing Girls, as you know, and we've got a special guest today.
121380	123380	It's Smile Tone.
123380	124380	Hey, y'all.
124380	126380	Isn't he cute?
126380	129740	Man, you can just see in his eyes as he's doing this.
129740	130980	This would be the one that goes viral.
130980	132380	This would be the one that makes me famous.
132380	136620	It should come as no surprise to anybody that his pre-activist employment also included
136620	138140	things like modeling and television.
138140	142580	She was like, you know what, I really want you to still work with me because the reality
143460	147460	show had like, it aired and it had like a couple episodes, but then it like got canceled.
147460	150180	And then she was like, I really want you to stay here, whatever.
150180	151620	So I started working with her.
151620	156020	I started getting connections, whatever, being a modeling agent, but bitch, I was a fab modeling
156020	157020	agent.
157020	158020	I was a bitch.
158020	161420	Yep, that's him with Jussie Smollett, probably where he got the idea to be a professional
161420	162420	race grifter.
162420	166420	And yes, he's basically a carbon copy of Chris Tucker in Fifth Element.
166420	169420	All night long.
169420	171420	All night long.
172260	177260	Like my parents and family always said I can become a comedian.
177260	182260	So I was like, let a girl tell a joke, let a girl tell a joke or two, bitch.
182260	183980	I don't think this is an act.
183980	186180	He's always been like this as far back as I can search.
186180	191020	Back in 2016, Sargon did an hour long deep dive into Ghazi Kodzo's early activist days
191020	194420	after that normie YouTuber period, but before the Black Hammer stuff.
194420	197980	It's still up on Sargon's original channel, not the Lotus Eaters channel, but original
197980	198980	Sargon.
198980	201220	And if you want to pause this video and watch it before coming back, you can, it's certainly
201220	202020	worth it.
202020	205380	I'll just give you the TLDR of this period of Kodzo's life because yeah, it's an hour
205380	206540	worth of stuff.
206540	210860	During this period of his life, Ghazi Kodzo is a black separatist, revolutionary communist,
210860	213560	and member of the African People's Socialist Party.
213560	217340	His previous attempts at getting big on the internet had gone bust, but the racial stuff
217340	220660	seemed to get a few more clicks, so he stuck with it in a desperate attempt to try and
220660	224140	fill the hole in his soul that he blamed all white people for creating.
224140	227980	All of his old, non-racial activist content has been purged off the internet.
227980	231860	The Smiletone's name is, at this point, Dead and Buried, and his YouTube channel is filled
231860	235660	with such amazing insights as, is being gay anti-pro-black?
235660	240100	First and foremost, y'all know I don't go by gay, I go by same gender loving.
240100	244300	If you don't understand why, go look at my video, I'm not gay.
244300	245660	Let's talk about Latinos.
245660	250100	Colonialism pits colonized people against each other, right?
250100	253420	Divide and conquer is the Europeans' rule, right?
253420	257940	Divide and conquer is the Neanderthal's, Tom's, like, main rule.
257940	259540	I don't trust Caitlyn Jenner.
259540	263460	My ancestors are telling me not to trust this cave Becky, Caitlyn Jenner.
263460	268940	Sorry girl, but by the political views that I've gotten from you from your interviews,
268940	273540	you are giving me very Ann Cauldron tease right now, girl, and it's quite threatening
273540	275900	and triggering, okay?
275900	277940	These interracial relationships are out of control.
277940	282420	You'd be dipping into this blue cheese dressing, you know, blue cheese dressing because there's
282420	286580	skin complexion, the white with the blue veins, blue cheese dressing, you'd be dipping
286580	295260	into that, and then when, you know, Ms. Elizabeth Samantha Roodebaker decides to kick your black
295260	300740	behind out her house, you go running to who?
300740	302420	Your black mama.
302420	304620	And um, I probably can't say this one.
304620	305780	I'm gonna get yeeted off YouTube.
305780	308540	Talking about, well, if black people didn't listen to that kind of music, and if black
308540	310260	people talk this way, black people walk this way.
310260	316580	Like I keep telling y'all, Martin Luther King was educated, articulate, dressed white,
316580	321220	talked white, and praised the white god as much as he possibly could, as much as his
321220	326020	knees would allow him to, he would pray to that white god, and they still killed him.
326020	332780	So what makes you think that they give a damn about how much you respect yourself?
332780	337100	I've covered black separatists and supremacists and other components of BLM before on this
337100	341340	channel, but I gotta say, never somebody who was so blatantly unhinged.
341340	345220	As I kept skimming through his newer videos, I noticed his rhetoric became more and more
345220	349620	extreme as time went on, until finally, he left the African People's Socialist Party
349620	351340	to do his own thing.
351340	352340	Black Power, y'all.
352340	357540	According to y'all, it's me, Gazi Cudzel, and my comrade for life.
357540	361740	The uh, Black Power, y'all.
361740	367340	So we came today, this afternoon, on this beautiful Wednesday, to let y'all know that
367340	371860	Gazi and I left that other organization.
371860	383660	Yeah, we did, you guys, oh my gosh, it was so crazy, first and foremost, I'm a free bitch!
383660	389200	His initial goal was to raise $10,000 on GoFundMe, under the name Black Power Project, to build
389200	391960	a black-focused community center in Atlanta, Georgia.
391960	395720	At this point in Cudzel's story, at the same time as his rhetoric is radicalizing
395720	399900	into more overtly black fascist territory, it also becomes harder to ignore that he's
399900	404200	no longer doing out-of-the-bedroom type stuff, and instead is delivering his sermons on the
404200	407180	grounds of what appear to be a pretty nice looking place.
407180	411060	Around this time, he finally started up the Black Hammer organization, and began soliciting
411060	412880	donations to help with the struggle.
412880	417380	Now, there is at least one video showing them donating some food or doing some kind of charity,
417380	421780	so who knows, maybe they actually did do, at one point, some decent work, fair enough.
421780	429260	But watching this video, I can't help but notice how cucked the white comrades look.
429260	432020	Do you feel like a proud white ally of black supremacy?
432020	433720	Cause you sound like one, buddy.
433720	437400	Black Hammer first really hit the spotlight, when they announced the creation of Hammer
437400	438400	City.
438400	441860	On their website, they describe a project called Hammer Cities, building cities of all
441860	446580	people of color to be free, no discrimination of nationality, gender, age, mental or physical
446580	451460	differences, jobs, housing, food, healthcare, no cops, no rent, no coronavirus, and no white
451460	456040	people, returning the land to indigenous people, building Hammer Cities all over the world.
456040	460680	This project's already raised over $100,000, and in 2020, the Black Hammers recorded a
460680	464700	video of themselves washing their bodies in a stream on the property that would eventually
464700	474280	become the first Hammer City.
474280	478000	The Black Hammer Times, a reputable outlet I'm sure, announced that the Black Hammer
478000	482500	liberated over 200 acres to build their city, boy, doesn't this look like a place you
482500	485500	want to live?
485500	493880	Well, it turns out that Hammer City ain't happening, shocking news I know, because the
493880	496880	purchase of the 200 acres of desert and shrub land fell through.
496880	500720	That didn't stop them from trying though, as local sheriffs had to respond to a trespass
500720	505480	complaint where, after rejecting the offer to buy the land, Black Hammer remained there
505480	508860	anyway, camping on the property until dispersed by police.
508860	512480	It's also probably important to point out that during the Hammer City occupation, they
512480	517780	had a campfire where they burned Anne Frank's diary because she was quote, a white colonizer.
517780	520840	What the fuck was she colonizing, the gap under the floorboards?
520840	524660	Like most other black supremacist and black separatist organizations, the Black Hammer
524660	529920	and Kodzo himself are extremely anti-semitic, viewing Jews as simultaneously a capitalist
529920	533720	internationalist oppressor class like the Nazis did, but unlike the Nazis, they also
533720	535800	view the Jews as white Europeans.
535800	540660	To groups like this, any historic injustices, either real or imagined, carried out by Jewish
540660	556820	individuals or groups, are all white people's fault.
556820	560920	After the failure of Hammer City, word began to spread from the people who were leaving
560920	563360	the Black Hammer about what actually happened there.
563360	567500	They had no food and only stream water to drink, which turned out to not be all that
567500	568500	drinkable.
568500	572900	Several Black Hammer members became sick after attempting to burn mugwort for warmth, getting
572900	576700	poisoned by the smoke instead, and when they finally retreated from the site, the landowner
576700	581040	found a half-completed bridge, a handful of screws that were scattered across a road,
581040	584380	presumably dropped accidentally, and shell casings from target practice.
584380	587900	There was never any city, and to this date, who knows where the money went.
587900	591900	Upon returning to Atlanta, Kodzo became more deranged after the failure of Hammer City
591900	592960	to materialize.
592960	597020	He began to implement communist struggle sessions where individual members were singled out
597020	600460	for public self-degradation regarding how they caused Hammer City to fail.
600460	604500	Kodzo began experimenting with microdosing drugs, both himself and other individuals
604500	608040	living at the compound, which was really just his rather large house in the suburbs.
608040	611960	Black Hammer members were pressured into dipping into their savings and donating their plasma
611960	613100	for the struggle.
613100	617700	The group quietly fell apart during 2021 after all of the media and internet attention had
617700	621860	moved on, and one former member told the Daily Beast she wasn't allowed to leave the group
621860	624060	and had to pull a knife in order to force her way out.
624060	627700	At this point, just looking at it from the outside, the Black Hammer sounds like a cult.
627700	631340	In fact, I did that video on Yvette Filarca like five years ago, and she did this exact
631340	632340	same stuff too.
632340	635780	All of these Antifa or Commie or Anarchist or whatever groups, they seem to follow the
635780	636780	same pattern.
636780	639660	They entice young people to abandon their families and invite them to come live free
639660	643500	of charge at these revolutionary locations, which turn out to be houses owned by the cult
643500	646200	leader, where they are then put to work and prevented from leaving.
646200	649160	As Black Hammer continued to deteriorate, Kodzo shifted focus.
649160	653220	He began recruiting homeless people to replenish his ranks, with a special focus on homeless
653220	654580	teenaged young men.
683220	706120	Black
706120	711740	Hammer Times reports the event as such, Rest in Power Minister of Defense AP, in a targeted
711740	716040	attack by the Fayetteville Police Department, Swat and the FBI on the headquarters of the
716040	720400	Atlanta chapter of the Black Hammer Party, Black Hammer's Minister of Defense, AP, was
720400	721540	shot and killed.
721540	726000	One of the most luminous, bright, charismatic, real, humble, and inspired young people in
726000	729080	Atlanta and in the world, AP was killed by the colonial state.
729080	730300	He was 18 years old.
730300	732440	And today, they publish their tell-all!
732440	737140	On the morning of Tuesday, July 19th, 2022, the Fayetteville Police Department, Swat,
737140	740020	and the FBI ambushed the Atlanta headquarters of the Black Hammer Party.
740020	742600	By the end of the day, one Hammer was shot and killed by the police.
742600	746140	His name is AP, our party's Minister of Defense, and he was 19 years old.
746140	748140	Come on guys, at least get the age right.
748140	751420	That morning, the Hammers were descended upon by the Fayetteville Police Department and
751420	754080	Swat, who over loudspeakers, told everyone to come outside.
754080	758640	One comrade was out walking the dog and got tackled by police.
758640	761060	Everyone came outside of the house except the Minister of Defense, AP.
761060	763740	The Hammers called to him, tried to get him to come out, but police said they'd go in
763740	765000	and sweep the house.
765000	768500	This ambush came from a call from someone from the streets that was being sheltered
768500	772500	in the house, and was starting the work of housing, feeding, and clothing the homeless.
772500	776260	When he realized he wasn't down with the mission of serving our poor black and brown
776260	780020	people during a worldwide food shortage, record unemployment, and more, he was asked to leave
780020	784060	the house, since it's a home for homeless revolutionary leaders and comrades.
784060	785280	He became belligerent.
785280	789020	It was then that he made a phone call, putting the lives of homeless men and women in danger.
789020	794620	By AP, they're referring to Amante T. Ammons, who had killed himself within Kodzo's house.
794620	798160	What actually went down was, something like a dozen Black Hammer members were living with
798200	801160	Kodzo when the police received a 911 call from the location.
801160	805960	A whisper across the line told the dispatcher that they had been kidnapped and to send police.
805960	809140	The police told everyone to come out, and then discovered Ammon's body.
809140	812300	We still don't know if it was Ammons who made the call, or if he truly did kill himself,
812300	815280	but we do know that it wasn't the cops who shot him, because the cops didn't actually
815280	816280	go into the house.
816280	818900	A bomb robot did, and the robot discovered the body.
818900	821680	During this standoff, Kodzo reaffirmed what we all already knew.
821680	824960	At the end of the day, there's still breath in my body.
824960	827760	I still run an amazing revolutionary party.
827760	830120	Our community is effing with us.
830120	835120	And now, all these news channels are going to want to interview us, and we are going
835120	839120	to get to communicate about all the great work that we are doing here.
839120	845200	So this is great at the end of the day.
845200	847800	This is a great moment.
847800	848800	Right comrade?
848800	849800	This is a great moment.
849800	858080	A moment where our voices will be amplified, and our mission and cause will be informed.
858080	859480	This is about fame for him.
859480	860480	His recognition.
860480	861480	His standing.
861480	864640	He delusionally believed this was going to be the springboard to his next time in the
864640	865640	spotlight.
865640	868320	Instead, he was charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, false imprisonment, kidnapping,
868320	871280	aggravated assault, gang activity, and aggravated sodomy.
871280	874980	Another Black Hammer member, Xavier Hakim Rashin, was hit with the same charges, minus
874980	875980	the sodomy.
875980	879720	It seems to be the case, based on the knowledge available right now, that Kodzo was butt-fucking
880640	881640	the young homeless men he was recruiting.
881640	884120	Though, nowadays, Kodzo is 36 years old.
884120	887220	And man, those drugs are making him look like a hard 36.
887220	891920	His social media posts show him spending Black Hammer's donation money on leisure trips
891920	894080	with his three adopted sons.
894080	896680	These are three homeless black youth that Kodzo has taken in.
896680	899040	He calls them his sons, but he uses them for sex.
899040	902760	One is 16, one is 18, that's the one who shot himself, and one is 21.
902760	906960	Kodzo has no problem flaunting the fact that he has expanded his cult with young boy toys.
907200	913200	You know, this young kid was sleeping on the bench at that train station, and I woke him up.
913200	918200	And I said, you know, get up, and wake up, and I was like, do you want to come home with us or whatever?
918200	921200	And he just saw this strange gay man, and he was like, no.
921200	925100	Which he's supposed to do, you know, stranger danger, stranger danger, stranger danger.
925100	926200	And so, there you have it.
926200	931320	The brief rise and fall of Augustus Claudius Romaine Jr., aka Gazzy Kodzo, and his revolutionary
931320	934560	black separatist, communist, neo-fascist cult, the Black Hammer.
934560	936640	It didn't have to be this way, you know?
936640	938040	You could have just remained Smile Tone.
938040	940680	He didn't need to get into socialism, and then try to build a commune, and then end
940680	943720	up running a cult out of a crack shack where he fucked teenage boys.
943720	947920	He was a sissy, foppish gay guy as Smile Tone, sure, but there was some personality there.
947920	949820	His content was positive, it was cheery.
949820	952880	He clearly had inroads into where he wanted to go in show business.
952880	955120	He didn't have to degenerate into whatever the fuck this is.
955120	959880	It's me, Gazzy, the commander in chief of the Black Hammer organization.
959880	960880	Land back!
960880	961880	Land back!
961880	962880	Land back!
962880	963880	Land back!
964560	968120	Probably the funniest bit of all is that he took the group's name from the 1967 book
968120	972040	The Black Hammer, which describes the intersection of the Soviet agenda with the civil rights
972040	973560	movement of the 20th century.
973560	976280	Presumably, he didn't actually read the book, because it's written from the white
976280	979600	nationalist perspective, deriding the civil rights movement as communist subversion.
979600	982180	Or maybe he thought he was reclaiming the idea, who knows?
982180	985920	The point is, Kodzo's going to pound you in the ass prison for a long, long time, and
985920	988160	this will likely be the last we see of the Black Hammer.
988160	992600	Usually, these various revolutionary cells that want to overthrow liberal democracy don't
992600	996160	make it this easy to criticize them, but hey, I don't mind having my work cut out
996160	997160	from you sometimes.
997160	1000960	I will say though, don't fall into the trap of believing that these people aren't leftists
1000960	1003780	or are somehow unique among the various antifa cells.
1003780	1008300	They might be speedrunning the pipeline of confused college kid to socialist activist
1008300	1013980	to black bloc revolutionary to neo-fascist land back racial supremacist cultist rapists,
1013980	1017360	but this is a natural progression that people within these spheres go down.
1017360	1021280	It usually takes them decades, not years, but still, this is the endpoint for every
1021280	1024680	antifa goon who doesn't get pulled out and deradicalized.
1024680	1029320	Either they end up being charismatic grifter leaders and sex pests, hunting for fame and
1029320	1032240	fortune, or they become the victims of those people.
1032240	1037920	So if ever there's an asshole around you, you can deal with him accordingly with this
1037920	1038920	knife, alright?
1038920	1039920	Land back!
1039920	1040920	Land back!
1040920	1041920	Land back!
1041920	1042920	Land back!
1042920	1043920	Land back!
1043920	1044920	Land back!
1044920	1045920	Land back!
1045920	1046920	Woo!
1046920	1047920	It feels good to win, don't it?
1047920	1049920	It feels good to be number one.
1049920	1050920	Land back!
1050920	1051560	Land back!
