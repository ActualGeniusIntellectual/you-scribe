1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
There's this Twitter account that I follow called Antifa Watch.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,720
They do pretty much what their name suggests, and I noticed yesterday that they put this

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
tweet out.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,000
There was some sort of hostage situation, and one person is dead at the home of the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,980
black supremacist communist organization known as the Black Hammer in Fayetteville, Georgia.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,440
The attached images are of a Facebook stream by Gazi Kodzo titled Still Outside with the

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,840
Feds, and a post saying, they killed my son.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,500
The news article linked, however, said that the man who was found dead at the location

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,900
was not killed by the police, as Kodzo's post suggested, but instead was self-inflicted.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,100
Before we get into the details of this specific event, though, we've got to talk about that

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,160
black supremacist communist organization, the Black Hammer, and its leader, Gazi Kodzo.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,880
I think I might have spoken about these guys before, maybe in the context of CHAZ.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,720
They weren't a part of CHAZ, but they've also tried to set up similar communes several

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
times over the years.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,440
In any case, let's go back to the beginning.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,000
Gazi Kodzo's legal name is Augustus Claudius Romaine Jr., and despite the Black Hammer

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,640
only being formed in 2019, this guy's been around for a long time under the YouTube name

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Smile Tone.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,920
The Smile Tone YouTube channel has been rebranded to fit the current Black Hammer project, but

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,980
if you scroll back far enough, there's content from as early as 2014 dealing with racial

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,480
and social justice.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,840
It's very bedroom feminist type stuff that was popular during that era of YouTube.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,620
Everything from before his activism, however, has been scrubbed off the internet, but remember,

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,620
the internet never forgets.

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,620
Hey, y'all.

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,620
It's me, Smile Tone.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,220
And today, we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,340
Steve Jobs, and I'm going to tell you why I hate him.

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,220
Reason number one is he's a modern day Wizard of Oz, okay?

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,140
He promises you guys that he has all the answers and all the best technology, but behind all

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,700
that smoke and mirrors, he's nothing but an idiot selling to idiots.

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,300
Yeah, before getting into politics, this guy tried to basically do whatever he could to

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,700
get YouTube fame, including talking about tech or video games or whatever else, as well

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,380
as crossovers with other normie-type YouTubers to try and grow his audience.

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,380
Hey, guys.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,380
What's up?

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,380
We're the Wing Girls, as you know, and we've got a special guest today.

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,380
It's Smile Tone.

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,380
Hey, y'all.

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,380
Isn't he cute?

41
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,740
Man, you can just see in his eyes as he's doing this.

42
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,980
This would be the one that goes viral.

43
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,380
This would be the one that makes me famous.

44
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,620
It should come as no surprise to anybody that his pre-activist employment also included

45
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,140
things like modeling and television.

46
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,580
She was like, you know what, I really want you to still work with me because the reality

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,460
show had like, it aired and it had like a couple episodes, but then it like got canceled.

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,180
And then she was like, I really want you to stay here, whatever.

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,620
So I started working with her.

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,020
I started getting connections, whatever, being a modeling agent, but bitch, I was a fab modeling

51
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
agent.

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
I was a bitch.

53
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,420
Yep, that's him with Jussie Smollett, probably where he got the idea to be a professional

54
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,420
race grifter.

55
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,420
And yes, he's basically a carbon copy of Chris Tucker in Fifth Element.

56
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,420
All night long.

57
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,420
All night long.

58
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Like my parents and family always said I can become a comedian.

59
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,260
So I was like, let a girl tell a joke, let a girl tell a joke or two, bitch.

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,980
I don't think this is an act.

61
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,180
He's always been like this as far back as I can search.

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,020
Back in 2016, Sargon did an hour long deep dive into Ghazi Kodzo's early activist days

63
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,420
after that normie YouTuber period, but before the Black Hammer stuff.

64
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,980
It's still up on Sargon's original channel, not the Lotus Eaters channel, but original

65
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,980
Sargon.

66
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,220
And if you want to pause this video and watch it before coming back, you can, it's certainly

67
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,020
worth it.

68
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,380
I'll just give you the TLDR of this period of Kodzo's life because yeah, it's an hour

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,540
worth of stuff.

70
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,860
During this period of his life, Ghazi Kodzo is a black separatist, revolutionary communist,

71
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,560
and member of the African People's Socialist Party.

72
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,340
His previous attempts at getting big on the internet had gone bust, but the racial stuff

73
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,660
seemed to get a few more clicks, so he stuck with it in a desperate attempt to try and

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,140
fill the hole in his soul that he blamed all white people for creating.

75
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,980
All of his old, non-racial activist content has been purged off the internet.

76
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,860
The Smiletone's name is, at this point, Dead and Buried, and his YouTube channel is filled

77
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,660
with such amazing insights as, is being gay anti-pro-black?

78
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,100
First and foremost, y'all know I don't go by gay, I go by same gender loving.

79
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,300
If you don't understand why, go look at my video, I'm not gay.

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,660
Let's talk about Latinos.

81
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,100
Colonialism pits colonized people against each other, right?

82
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,420
Divide and conquer is the Europeans' rule, right?

83
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,940
Divide and conquer is the Neanderthal's, Tom's, like, main rule.

84
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,540
I don't trust Caitlyn Jenner.

85
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,460
My ancestors are telling me not to trust this cave Becky, Caitlyn Jenner.

86
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,940
Sorry girl, but by the political views that I've gotten from you from your interviews,

87
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,540
you are giving me very Ann Cauldron tease right now, girl, and it's quite threatening

88
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,900
and triggering, okay?

89
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,940
These interracial relationships are out of control.

90
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,420
You'd be dipping into this blue cheese dressing, you know, blue cheese dressing because there's

91
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,580
skin complexion, the white with the blue veins, blue cheese dressing, you'd be dipping

92
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:55,260
into that, and then when, you know, Ms. Elizabeth Samantha Roodebaker decides to kick your black

93
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,740
behind out her house, you go running to who?

94
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,420
Your black mama.

95
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,620
And um, I probably can't say this one.

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,780
I'm gonna get yeeted off YouTube.

97
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,540
Talking about, well, if black people didn't listen to that kind of music, and if black

98
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,260
people talk this way, black people walk this way.

99
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,580
Like I keep telling y'all, Martin Luther King was educated, articulate, dressed white,

100
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,220
talked white, and praised the white god as much as he possibly could, as much as his

101
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,020
knees would allow him to, he would pray to that white god, and they still killed him.

102
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:32,780
So what makes you think that they give a damn about how much you respect yourself?

103
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,100
I've covered black separatists and supremacists and other components of BLM before on this

104
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,340
channel, but I gotta say, never somebody who was so blatantly unhinged.

105
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,220
As I kept skimming through his newer videos, I noticed his rhetoric became more and more

106
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,620
extreme as time went on, until finally, he left the African People's Socialist Party

107
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,340
to do his own thing.

108
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,340
Black Power, y'all.

109
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,540
According to y'all, it's me, Gazi Cudzel, and my comrade for life.

110
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,740
The uh, Black Power, y'all.

111
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,340
So we came today, this afternoon, on this beautiful Wednesday, to let y'all know that

112
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,860
Gazi and I left that other organization.

113
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:23,660
Yeah, we did, you guys, oh my gosh, it was so crazy, first and foremost, I'm a free bitch!

114
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,200
His initial goal was to raise $10,000 on GoFundMe, under the name Black Power Project, to build

115
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,960
a black-focused community center in Atlanta, Georgia.

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,720
At this point in Cudzel's story, at the same time as his rhetoric is radicalizing

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,900
into more overtly black fascist territory, it also becomes harder to ignore that he's

118
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,200
no longer doing out-of-the-bedroom type stuff, and instead is delivering his sermons on the

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,180
grounds of what appear to be a pretty nice looking place.

120
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,060
Around this time, he finally started up the Black Hammer organization, and began soliciting

121
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,880
donations to help with the struggle.

122
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,380
Now, there is at least one video showing them donating some food or doing some kind of charity,

123
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,780
so who knows, maybe they actually did do, at one point, some decent work, fair enough.

124
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:09,260
But watching this video, I can't help but notice how cucked the white comrades look.

125
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,020
Do you feel like a proud white ally of black supremacy?

126
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,720
Cause you sound like one, buddy.

127
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,400
Black Hammer first really hit the spotlight, when they announced the creation of Hammer

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
City.

129
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,860
On their website, they describe a project called Hammer Cities, building cities of all

130
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,580
people of color to be free, no discrimination of nationality, gender, age, mental or physical

131
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,460
differences, jobs, housing, food, healthcare, no cops, no rent, no coronavirus, and no white

132
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,040
people, returning the land to indigenous people, building Hammer Cities all over the world.

133
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,680
This project's already raised over $100,000, and in 2020, the Black Hammers recorded a

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,700
video of themselves washing their bodies in a stream on the property that would eventually

135
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:54,280
become the first Hammer City.

136
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,000
The Black Hammer Times, a reputable outlet I'm sure, announced that the Black Hammer

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,500
liberated over 200 acres to build their city, boy, doesn't this look like a place you

138
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
want to live?

139
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:13,880
Well, it turns out that Hammer City ain't happening, shocking news I know, because the

140
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,880
purchase of the 200 acres of desert and shrub land fell through.

141
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,720
That didn't stop them from trying though, as local sheriffs had to respond to a trespass

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,480
complaint where, after rejecting the offer to buy the land, Black Hammer remained there

143
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,860
anyway, camping on the property until dispersed by police.

144
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,480
It's also probably important to point out that during the Hammer City occupation, they

145
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,780
had a campfire where they burned Anne Frank's diary because she was quote, a white colonizer.

146
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,840
What the fuck was she colonizing, the gap under the floorboards?

147
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,660
Like most other black supremacist and black separatist organizations, the Black Hammer

148
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,920
and Kodzo himself are extremely anti-semitic, viewing Jews as simultaneously a capitalist

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,720
internationalist oppressor class like the Nazis did, but unlike the Nazis, they also

150
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,800
view the Jews as white Europeans.

151
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,660
To groups like this, any historic injustices, either real or imagined, carried out by Jewish

152
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:16,820
individuals or groups, are all white people's fault.

153
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,920
After the failure of Hammer City, word began to spread from the people who were leaving

154
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,360
the Black Hammer about what actually happened there.

155
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,500
They had no food and only stream water to drink, which turned out to not be all that

156
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
drinkable.

157
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,900
Several Black Hammer members became sick after attempting to burn mugwort for warmth, getting

158
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,700
poisoned by the smoke instead, and when they finally retreated from the site, the landowner

159
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,040
found a half-completed bridge, a handful of screws that were scattered across a road,

160
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,380
presumably dropped accidentally, and shell casings from target practice.

161
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,900
There was never any city, and to this date, who knows where the money went.

162
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Upon returning to Atlanta, Kodzo became more deranged after the failure of Hammer City

163
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,960
to materialize.

164
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,020
He began to implement communist struggle sessions where individual members were singled out

165
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,460
for public self-degradation regarding how they caused Hammer City to fail.

166
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,500
Kodzo began experimenting with microdosing drugs, both himself and other individuals

167
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,040
living at the compound, which was really just his rather large house in the suburbs.

168
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,960
Black Hammer members were pressured into dipping into their savings and donating their plasma

169
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,100
for the struggle.

170
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,700
The group quietly fell apart during 2021 after all of the media and internet attention had

171
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,860
moved on, and one former member told the Daily Beast she wasn't allowed to leave the group

172
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,060
and had to pull a knife in order to force her way out.

173
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,700
At this point, just looking at it from the outside, the Black Hammer sounds like a cult.

174
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,340
In fact, I did that video on Yvette Filarca like five years ago, and she did this exact

175
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
same stuff too.

176
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,780
All of these Antifa or Commie or Anarchist or whatever groups, they seem to follow the

177
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
same pattern.

178
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,660
They entice young people to abandon their families and invite them to come live free

179
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,500
of charge at these revolutionary locations, which turn out to be houses owned by the cult

180
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200
leader, where they are then put to work and prevented from leaving.

181
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,160
As Black Hammer continued to deteriorate, Kodzo shifted focus.

182
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,220
He began recruiting homeless people to replenish his ranks, with a special focus on homeless

183
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,580
teenaged young men.

184
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:46,120
Black

185
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,740
Hammer Times reports the event as such, Rest in Power Minister of Defense AP, in a targeted

186
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,040
attack by the Fayetteville Police Department, Swat and the FBI on the headquarters of the

187
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,400
Atlanta chapter of the Black Hammer Party, Black Hammer's Minister of Defense, AP, was

188
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,540
shot and killed.

189
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,000
One of the most luminous, bright, charismatic, real, humble, and inspired young people in

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,080
Atlanta and in the world, AP was killed by the colonial state.

191
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,300
He was 18 years old.

192
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,440
And today, they publish their tell-all!

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,140
On the morning of Tuesday, July 19th, 2022, the Fayetteville Police Department, Swat,

194
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,020
and the FBI ambushed the Atlanta headquarters of the Black Hammer Party.

195
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,600
By the end of the day, one Hammer was shot and killed by the police.

196
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,140
His name is AP, our party's Minister of Defense, and he was 19 years old.

197
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,140
Come on guys, at least get the age right.

198
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,420
That morning, the Hammers were descended upon by the Fayetteville Police Department and

199
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,080
Swat, who over loudspeakers, told everyone to come outside.

200
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,640
One comrade was out walking the dog and got tackled by police.

201
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,060
Everyone came outside of the house except the Minister of Defense, AP.

202
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,740
The Hammers called to him, tried to get him to come out, but police said they'd go in

203
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,000
and sweep the house.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,500
This ambush came from a call from someone from the streets that was being sheltered

205
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
in the house, and was starting the work of housing, feeding, and clothing the homeless.

206
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,260
When he realized he wasn't down with the mission of serving our poor black and brown

207
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,020
people during a worldwide food shortage, record unemployment, and more, he was asked to leave

208
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,060
the house, since it's a home for homeless revolutionary leaders and comrades.

209
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,280
He became belligerent.

210
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,020
It was then that he made a phone call, putting the lives of homeless men and women in danger.

211
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,620
By AP, they're referring to Amante T. Ammons, who had killed himself within Kodzo's house.

212
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,160
What actually went down was, something like a dozen Black Hammer members were living with

213
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,160
Kodzo when the police received a 911 call from the location.

214
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,960
A whisper across the line told the dispatcher that they had been kidnapped and to send police.

215
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,140
The police told everyone to come out, and then discovered Ammon's body.

216
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,300
We still don't know if it was Ammons who made the call, or if he truly did kill himself,

217
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,280
but we do know that it wasn't the cops who shot him, because the cops didn't actually

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
go into the house.

219
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,900
A bomb robot did, and the robot discovered the body.

220
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,680
During this standoff, Kodzo reaffirmed what we all already knew.

221
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,960
At the end of the day, there's still breath in my body.

222
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,760
I still run an amazing revolutionary party.

223
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,120
Our community is effing with us.

224
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,120
And now, all these news channels are going to want to interview us, and we are going

225
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
to get to communicate about all the great work that we are doing here.

226
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,200
So this is great at the end of the day.

227
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,800
This is a great moment.

228
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Right comrade?

229
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
This is a great moment.

230
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:18,080
A moment where our voices will be amplified, and our mission and cause will be informed.

231
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
This is about fame for him.

232
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
His recognition.

233
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
His standing.

234
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,640
He delusionally believed this was going to be the springboard to his next time in the

235
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
spotlight.

236
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,320
Instead, he was charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, false imprisonment, kidnapping,

237
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,280
aggravated assault, gang activity, and aggravated sodomy.

238
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,980
Another Black Hammer member, Xavier Hakim Rashin, was hit with the same charges, minus

239
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
the sodomy.

240
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,720
It seems to be the case, based on the knowledge available right now, that Kodzo was butt-fucking

241
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
the young homeless men he was recruiting.

242
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,120
Though, nowadays, Kodzo is 36 years old.

243
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,220
And man, those drugs are making him look like a hard 36.

244
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,920
His social media posts show him spending Black Hammer's donation money on leisure trips

245
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,080
with his three adopted sons.

246
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,680
These are three homeless black youth that Kodzo has taken in.

247
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,040
He calls them his sons, but he uses them for sex.

248
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,760
One is 16, one is 18, that's the one who shot himself, and one is 21.

249
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,960
Kodzo has no problem flaunting the fact that he has expanded his cult with young boy toys.

250
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,200
You know, this young kid was sleeping on the bench at that train station, and I woke him up.

251
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,200
And I said, you know, get up, and wake up, and I was like, do you want to come home with us or whatever?

252
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
And he just saw this strange gay man, and he was like, no.

253
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,100
Which he's supposed to do, you know, stranger danger, stranger danger, stranger danger.

254
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,200
And so, there you have it.

255
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,320
The brief rise and fall of Augustus Claudius Romaine Jr., aka Gazzy Kodzo, and his revolutionary

256
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,560
black separatist, communist, neo-fascist cult, the Black Hammer.

257
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,640
It didn't have to be this way, you know?

258
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,040
You could have just remained Smile Tone.

259
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,680
He didn't need to get into socialism, and then try to build a commune, and then end

260
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,720
up running a cult out of a crack shack where he fucked teenage boys.

261
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,920
He was a sissy, foppish gay guy as Smile Tone, sure, but there was some personality there.

262
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,820
His content was positive, it was cheery.

263
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,880
He clearly had inroads into where he wanted to go in show business.

264
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
He didn't have to degenerate into whatever the fuck this is.

265
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,880
It's me, Gazzy, the commander in chief of the Black Hammer organization.

266
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Land back!

267
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Land back!

268
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Land back!

269
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Land back!

270
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,120
Probably the funniest bit of all is that he took the group's name from the 1967 book

271
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,040
The Black Hammer, which describes the intersection of the Soviet agenda with the civil rights

272
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,560
movement of the 20th century.

273
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,280
Presumably, he didn't actually read the book, because it's written from the white

274
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,600
nationalist perspective, deriding the civil rights movement as communist subversion.

275
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,180
Or maybe he thought he was reclaiming the idea, who knows?

276
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,920
The point is, Kodzo's going to pound you in the ass prison for a long, long time, and

277
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
this will likely be the last we see of the Black Hammer.

278
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,600
Usually, these various revolutionary cells that want to overthrow liberal democracy don't

279
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,160
make it this easy to criticize them, but hey, I don't mind having my work cut out

280
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
from you sometimes.

281
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,960
I will say though, don't fall into the trap of believing that these people aren't leftists

282
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,780
or are somehow unique among the various antifa cells.

283
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,300
They might be speedrunning the pipeline of confused college kid to socialist activist

284
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,980
to black bloc revolutionary to neo-fascist land back racial supremacist cultist rapists,

285
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,360
but this is a natural progression that people within these spheres go down.

286
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,280
It usually takes them decades, not years, but still, this is the endpoint for every

287
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,680
antifa goon who doesn't get pulled out and deradicalized.

288
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,320
Either they end up being charismatic grifter leaders and sex pests, hunting for fame and

289
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,240
fortune, or they become the victims of those people.

290
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,920
So if ever there's an asshole around you, you can deal with him accordingly with this

291
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
knife, alright?

292
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Land back!

293
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Land back!

294
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Land back!

295
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Land back!

296
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Land back!

297
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Land back!

298
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Land back!

299
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Woo!

300
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
It feels good to win, don't it?

301
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
It feels good to be number one.

302
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Land back!

303
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,560
Land back!
