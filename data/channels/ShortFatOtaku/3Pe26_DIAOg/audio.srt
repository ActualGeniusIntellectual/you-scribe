1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome to the final episode everyone. No Lilith today, unfortunately. She got called in to work. She's not here. I kind of envy her. She doesn't have to watch The Last of Us.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What does she really call in to work? Like, we have to ask ourselves.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's not Rings of Power.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah, it's not that bad. As you said last time, Arch, this was The Good Show.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, this is as good as modern entertainment is likely to get.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You see how he's trying to twist you, Arch. He's trying to say, oh, it's The Good Show. But he's leaving out the context.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Compared to Velma or She-Hulk.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Lilith still appears on my channel in the TUBcast and we'll get her in for something else down the road, I'm sure.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She's spared the finale. And, okay, it's really strange that the finale is episode 9.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You know what I mean? I've seen seasons be 8 episodes, 10 episodes, 12 episodes, not 9 episodes.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, it's kind of a weird spot to end it.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Considering this feels like it needs more.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like, 12 episodes would help.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, if this show had 3 more episodes, they could have done their 2 flashback bits just fine and filled out the rest of the actual content of the show and everyone would have been happy.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But this show feels like it wasted too much time and now it's rushing to the end.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's true.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Also, Arch, I was reading the comments on your channel since, for those of you who only watch my channel, Arch and Kibz go do a podcast about this after we do the React video.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was reading comments on your channel, Arch, and some people were saying that all the big YouTube channels that cover this sort of thing, like Nerdronic and guys like that, they all gave this show up 2 or 3 episodes in.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm made of sterner stuff than soft, genteel persons like this.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's true. We've endured lots of really bad shows.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Joking aside, this isn't that bad. It's bland. Sure, it's mediocre. Yeah, it's not that interesting.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But this ain't no Obi-Wan Kenobi. This doesn't hurt. There's no Wellma where I watch the episodes and I'm in pain.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's just a long series of insults.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It hurts. It physically hurts to be there. It's like, oh, I think I want to die.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, those other channels that they did watch all of Kenobi and they did they did watch Velma, they did watch whatever it was. Right.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But also a lot of them skipped Andor. Andor too was just very mediocre. Yeah.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So I think I think they're there. Those guys are just focusing on the the really bad shows because they know like so.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But it's not necessarily so bad. It's good. It's more like so bad. It's content. Meanwhile, The Last of Us isn't so bad as content.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's just it's just kind of there, you know, doing it primarily for the clicks.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I mean, we're all doing it for the clicks. But once you've started a series.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, you got to finish. You got to finish. I actually completely agree with you on that.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If I if I wasn't like that, I probably would have given this one up, too, because it's not it's just not that interesting.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's not it's not even like it's not bad on a technical level. It's it's it's woke, but it's not ridiculously so.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's not it hasn't spun off into absurdity yet. It's just kind of there, you know.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Just meh. We're going to start it right now. Let's go for the finale.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is new, I think. TV show. You are not going to take another fucking deviation right now.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Surely. Yeah, this doesn't look familiar at all.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You don't remember a pregnant woman running through a forest. Nope.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's like here's another filler episode. You know, it seems like a bad idea to get pregnant in the apocalypse.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It does. Yeah. You might want to keep it down.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I know that's going to be a goddamn impossible. Yeah.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You know, childbirth, it's a three on the pain scale, not like stubbing your toe or anything.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, for God's sake. That's Ellie's night.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, is this Ellie's mother or something? Is the reason why she's immune because the zombie bit mommy just as she was being popped out?

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If so, this is completely new and this is made up bullshit.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yep. Because the implication was it was just like a random genetic defect or not defect, you know, mutation that made her immune.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, that just kind of sort of happened, I guess. She got lucky. I didn't even notice.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That was quick and easy. Wow. Childbirth really is a two out of 10 on the pain scale.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, and she has been. Oh, God, no, please don't tell me this is some gay record.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yep, it is because now that will be fed into the baby via the little umbilical cord.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, my God. And she used the same knife that she just stabbed the clicker with or whatever.

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's a brain dead move. Oh, to be fair, what else did you have? She was going to chew it off.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean, let's wipe it off on the fabric, you know, maybe. Well, maybe.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So you now have like a day or two to find someone to take this baby, because if you don't get that baby somewhere else.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're going to eat it. Also, how on God is good greed? This is the one of them.

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
OK, let's hear it for a second. Oh, no, that is a retcon.

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a retcon. Wow.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Pause there for a second. I just want to. OK, hold on.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All right. What's up, Arch? I just wanted to see if that zombie was even ever near her thighs to bite her.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yep, because this is something this show does constantly. Like people are suddenly they look down and they're like,

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, my God, I'm wounded. When the zombie was never even close to it. There's never a scene where it's like,

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
yeah, because they do the jump cuts and it's like, look, we cut so much. Oh, I can't believe it got so fast.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's like, yeah, you're so you're so bad at visual storytelling, you don't even show it.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, it kind of bent off in the general direction of her thigh for a second.

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Not anywhere close enough to bite her on the thigh, but at least they kind of pretended.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They put the vague effort forward. Yes, there was an effort made better than the previous one.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
All right. That was five minutes of the crucial super densely packed last episode wasted on a retcon origin story.

69
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Great. Good. That does nothing to the actual story whatsoever, because this information is literally not important.

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Good job. Utterly irrelevant. Let's go.

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just to retcon a few things here. It's like you've already convinced me that she has these powers.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I frankly don't care or need to know where she got them from. Well, it doesn't matter.

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's not the point of the story. It's a waste of time. I just hate it.

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The show uses time so poorly. I guess they're just relying on the fact that we've got two seasons, I guess.

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yep. Oh, that's right. They're going to just drag it out. Well, the second season is the second game, though.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What? Really? They've already confirmed that. Yeah. That's horrific.

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah. They've already confirmed. I do not want to watch the second season, Dev. They've already confirmed the second season is the second game.

78
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I looked it up in terms of the game's storyline.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:11,000
After the cannibal cultists, they have the final confrontation with the fireflies and then they go back to Tommy's commune for the finale.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So we're at the end of the game already. Yeah, I know we're I know this is like the end.

81
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But it was like I was like wondering, like, OK, they got on the season, but they I thought they said they weren't going to do that because, you know, nobody would like that.

82
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then I forget that Neil Druckmann is the executive producer.

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes. Oh, it all makes sense because he hates women. And the girl who wrote this, he hates his guts.

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So he needs to completely destroy everything she made. I keep forgetting that. Listen, I keep forgetting that.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Cibs, you can't make Neil Druckmann sound that based.

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Neil Druckmann hates women. I don't know if I'm willing to give him that W, Kyle.

87
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Sorry, but like the reason why he's doing what he's doing is because he hates the writer of the show so much or the game.

88
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, God, no. So this is going to be them who is going to find the baby and they're going to kill the mother just this before she bites her thigh.

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is so stupid. This retcon is so dumb. It makes no sense.

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's the Firefly leader, right? This never happens. This is all new.

91
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This is made up bullshit. Help me.

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like this, this is not necessarily a TV show.

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's the unnecessary desire to tether everything together.

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Star Wars had this problem, too, where it's like every every little side character in the background of every stupid shot is like some important thing.

95
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So everything has to be connected because that's just shitty writing.

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So is the story going to be that that the Firefly guys took Ellie and gave her to Fedra and then took her back?

97
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But only randomly because she she ran away with her girlfriend that one night.

98
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, but her mother was a Firefly, I guess. I guess this is all new.

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's why they took her in. And that's why they put her to give her to Fedra of all people.

100
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She needs to be fed.

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And I'm basically a mushroom. Yeah.

102
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I got it before I was bit.

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Before. You liar.

104
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't want you to give her this.

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't just put it. The baby is going to actually hit the spring and just knife itself.

106
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
All you know, it's just a very valuable is that we've known each other.

107
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Do they get is that the original voice actors right there?

108
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh, yeah, Kelly.

109
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This wreck on stupid crap right now.

110
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, it sounds like Ellie.

111
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
OK, I appreciate the idea of wanting to get the characters in as a little bit of a tribute to patrol homage thing.

112
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But the reckoning is pointless. Why don't you just make the prize the original rules?

113
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, she's obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, this was originally going to be a movie.

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I looked up on the Internet. This is going to be a movie based better.

115
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Please, please, please.

116
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This is going to be a movie.

117
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And the reason that it's the project switched was because a bunch of the actresses they wanted for Ellie all age out of the role,

118
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:00,000
they were trying to make it. Cover her ears.

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She's a baby.

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Now, look, the fireflies are based in good now.

121
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ten minutes of wasted time with the climax.

122
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So you know, Druckmann can justify his retcons.

123
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That was stupid and a waste of our time. This is the last time you guys will see that forehead.

124
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll think, fuck, it's so big. Yeah, her performance grew on me.

125
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But her forehead didn't. No, it grew on it.

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Where else would you hear me?

127
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, what I found this in there.

128
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
B for Roni, Chef Boyardee.

129
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That transition looked like what was going on was she was thinking back to the time she was one day old.

130
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Have you ever played this? Getting close.

131
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And again, we've completely skipped the nursing him back to health thing.

132
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That never happened. It's just, God, that was supposed to be a bonding event.

133
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's spring now.

134
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It would have been a good character growing moment for Ellie, too.

135
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It would show all the things she'd learned from Joel.

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But no, she'd stabbed him in the stomach twice with them penicillin, and then he killed the town.

137
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait, even after they bonded, Joel wasn't like this chummy with her.

138
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's almost like he's sucking up to her.

139
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That'd be great. He's thanking her for saving his bacon, I guess.

140
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sure Neil Druckmann had some words to say.

141
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's tainted. It's basically a pedo show now. I'm sad.

142
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
They both seem off now.

143
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Their character interactions feel wrong.

144
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Come on, I'll give you a boost.

145
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry, Joel. I'm distracted by memories of my mother, who I totally remember.

146
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's what this flashback is about. I'm going to talk about my mom.

147
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, fine.

148
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Just you kind of seem extra quiet today, so...

149
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

150
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Extra quiet? Oh, yes, because she's usually so very demure.

151
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, she's very chatty, actually.

152
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Show.

153
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I guess the show forgot her character for a bit there.

154
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think they forgot a lot of things the more they get into this.

155
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Whoa.

156
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Damn it, Ellie!

157
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay, I guess she got retarded, too.

158
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm glad you see this!

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ellie!

160
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Up here!

161
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Ellie!

162
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Come on!

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Jesus.

164
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What is wrong with the writing? Holy shit.

165
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Ellie!

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is a post-apocalyptic situation.

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're running through a building you've never been in, all excited around corners and rooms you've never seen before.

168
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Just out of curiosity, this isn't reminiscent of the game, is it?

169
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No.

170
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, I have a sneaking suspicion this is them running out of game and trying to right-throw themselves.

171
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No, I think this scene was unique, though, wasn't it?

172
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes, the zoo animals. Okay.

173
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, they skipped the actual entry into the city. They made that all different, but then there's the zoo animals part.

174
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will.

175
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, I do remember this thing. The giraffe. I don't know why I said thing.

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What are you doing?

177
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's all right.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Come here, hurry up. Come on.

179
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The writer wanted to reference Jurassic Park, okay? The brachiosaur scene.

180
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Na na na na na.

181
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Na na na. Yeah.

182
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
John Williams makes good music.

183
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now, the way into the city was through, like, a flooded bypass tunnel that had a bunch of clickers in it.

184
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But they just skipped all the exits.

185
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, it's video gaming.

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah.

187
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That might be fun to watch.

188
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Wouldn't want that.

189
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We need to see a birthing scene that didn't matter.

190
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All right, almost 20 minutes of this final super important episode finale.

191
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

192
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The only things that have happened is a retcon and a giraffe being fed.

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Also, Kibs, listen, I've seen your thumbnails on your channel. I know that pregnancy is your fetish, buddy.

194
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's true.

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's false. That was a meme.

196
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That wasn't a meme. I know the person. He liked it.

197
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What?

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He requested it. I know the guy who drew it.

199
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So?

200
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Is it everything you hoped for?

201
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What?

202
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, I requested it because it's a meme.

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
See? Your narrative falls apart. That's all it is.

204
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't worry, Kyle. I don't judge you for having a preggo fetish.

205
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The fuck?

206
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Look, I don't know exactly where this hospital is.

207
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, we'll find it.

208
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Sure. It's just...

209
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Maybe there's nothing bad out there, but so far there's always been something bad out there.

210
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We're still here, though.

211
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I know.

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But remarkably few zombies.

213
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It can't be for nothing.

214
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It will be, though. That's the plot twist.

215
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This is what we in the biz refer to as the establishing death flag scene.

216
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
After we're done, we'll totally go and do cool things.

217
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You'll not have a golf club hit your head, Joel. What?

218
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What golf club? Nothing.

219
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So, there's a YouTube channel called Fee that did a short little video describing why Tommy's city, Jacksonville I think it was, was not actually communism.

220
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And it's more like how the Amish lived.

221
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah. It was a good video.

222
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It was a good video, yeah. But basically, it lacks the coercive elements because everyone voluntarily comes together.

223
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And people can leave whenever they want.

224
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But that's what true communism is.

225
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's true. That isn't communism.

226
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So the show lied. The show's been trying to make things into communism.

227
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That is the communist's view of communism.

228
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Except they don't let you leave and they kill your entire family.

229
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, what's funny though is that in the game they didn't call it communism.

230
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It was just a collectively owned city because you had to because it was the apocalypse.

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because they needed to survive.

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But this is the current year and there's politics to be had.

233
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, narratives to be said.

234
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Wow, it's Chaz.

235
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh my god, I forgot what that was.

236
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's a blast from the past.

237
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yep.

238
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think that's new too.

239
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They keep making stuff up, don't they?

240
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I wasn't scared either. I was ready.

241
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, this is all new.

242
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So I decided to put a gun to the side of my head and shoot upwards.

243
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay. Joe, you're a tard.

244
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I think they're breaking his character in front of us.

245
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah, they're undermining him because he needs to be weaker.

246
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I still don't know why.

247
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They've broken him in body because of his panic attack, now they break him in spirit because he gave up.

248
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know why you're telling me all this.

249
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yep.

250
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I reckon you do.

251
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't think Sarah was brought up again between these two after that one scene.

252
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's why that one scene in the bedroom was so important.

253
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yep, because this devalues it too.

254
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The Last of Us confirms Joel's attempt at suicide, so it was not mentioned explicitly in the game as far as I can see.

255
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Also, I don't care if you flinch, if you've got a gun to your head, you can flinch as much as you want.

256
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That 800 meters per second bullet ain't gonna fucking care, bruh.

257
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I flinched a little, but the bullet caught up.

258
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In fact, the flinching was because of the bullet.

259
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So, I know we were talking through it, but he just said that Ellie is basically the replacement Sarah, and obviously Ellie is the replacement Sarah, but he never said it in the game.

260
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Shitty puns.

261
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Is this something you don't say?

262
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They expect you to think for yourself.

263
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
No, the game had a better writer.

264
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Uh-huh.

265
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's topical.

266
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's one. Moon rocks taste better than Earth rocks. Why?

267
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Because they're meteor...

268
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, that's terrible. That's a...

269
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's a zero out of ten.

270
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
These are pretty good, by the way.

271
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, but that other scene was, like, peeing on me.

272
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Some man.

273
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That was a three out of ten.

274
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Uh-oh.

275
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yep, I know. I've been watching them do that.

276
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Help me!

277
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Wow. That was the dumbest way this could have happened.

278
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Remember, he needs to fail. He cannot be successful or competent. He cannot be the one who brings her there in the end.

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, if this next part is like the game, he's about to be extremely competent.

280
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We'll see about that.

281
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But according to the retcon, he murdered some innocent people.

282
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You got here pretty hard.

283
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh, there she is.

284
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Five men. His only job was to protect him. He has still almost got killed.

285
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How'd she do it?

286
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It was all her.

287
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
She felt like hell to get here.

288
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
She's being prepped for surgery.

289
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But you said she wasn't hurt.

290
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Our doctor...

291
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
He thinks that the cordyceps anelli has grown with her since birth.

292
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Why is she in surgery?

293
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It produces a kind of chemical messenger. It makes normal cordyceps think that she's cordyceps. It's why she's immune.

294
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He's going to remove it from her, multiply the cells in the lab...

295
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's stupid.

296
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Because if that was the case, the zombies wouldn't attack her either.

297
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yep.

298
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He thinks it could be a cure, Joel.

299
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This is bullshit.

300
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, it sounds like an inoculation, not a cure, but still.

301
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Cordyceps grows inside the brain.

302
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It does.

303
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And if you kill the only person that has this...

304
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
There is no one else.

305
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We didn't tell her. We can cause her any fear. There won't be any pain.

306
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, you take me to her. You take me to her right now!

307
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's for the greater good, Joel.

308
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You don't understand.

309
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I do.

310
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I was there when she was born, Joel.

311
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No, you fucking weren't. God damn it.

312
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I was the black woman hero. You weren't, Joel.

313
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They're trying to make her seem not monstrous when she was pretty monstrous in the end.

314
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yep, because she's black and they have to do that to make him look bad because he's a white man.

315
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I know.

316
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:34,000
In the original story, you could find a log where they had done this on several other immune people before, and it didn't work, and they were just grasping at straws.

317
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It fails every time, because it doesn't do anything.

318
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, but Marlene was basically just like, no, it's going to work this time. We have to do it again.

319
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yep, that's why the last was part two, basically. They tried to paint it the other way, like, no, no, it would have worked. This time it's different.

320
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
He tries anything.

321
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Last time wasn't really communism, guys.

322
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Also, he's not even getting paid.

323
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No, she's going to hit the desk.

324
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Isn't that another retcon? Because I thought he got two options in the game.

325
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah.

326
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
To get paid or to leave.

327
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh, she's crying because she's the real victim.

328
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Marlene is a villain, by the way.

329
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I think in the game, basically, they had killed the others, and they didn't get enough data to recreate it, but they were almost there, and they just needed Ellie's brain to finally finish the vaccine.

330
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Well, that's what they claimed. They probably said that about the last children they killed, too.

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Thirty minutes. We are almost out of time in this episode, and nothing has happened.

332
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh, wow, Jesus.

333
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
They've wasted so much time.

334
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They're going to have to rush through this fucking rescue awfully quick, or just end it on a...

335
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Ugh, not just stop it on a cliffhanger. That would be the worst thing.

336
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You know, I'm pretty sure she heard those gunshots.

337
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yep.

338
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Help her!

339
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Joel's a monster.

340
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Ammo.

341
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
They were innocent people, what do you see?

342
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
They just wanted to kill children for fun.

343
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Well, the way it was set up in the game is basically like, at this point, Joel's destroyed multiple cities in defense of Ellie, and now he's going to destroy the cure in defense of Ellie.

344
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Also, I want to point out, he grabbed a magazine from what appeared to be an AR-15 or M-16. I bet you he's going to reload that M-14 with that.

345
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yep, they're going out of their way to make him look super fucked up and evil.

346
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Well, that's actually pretty close to the... Yeah, there it is, Archie.

347
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yep, yep, he's... beautiful.

348
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
God dammit.

349
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So, that's actually kind of the point of the game, though, Kip, is that by the end of the game, Joel was just doing blatantly immoral things in defense of Ellie. So that tracks.

350
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
He'll kill them.

351
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh great, another M-16 AR-15 to reload my M-14 with, yeah. They both start with M, don't they?

352
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is... they've somehow managed to make the sequence super lame with the music.

353
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's like...

354
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
He's so evil, guys.

355
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The thing is, right now they're just telling...

356
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Right now they're just telling...

357
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's like, this should not be a sad violin music. This should be a fucking rock moment.

358
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He is killing the bad people. These are not the heroes of this story.

359
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, we've already established that the fireflies aren't good.

360
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The show fucks up its final act, wonderful.

361
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Run out of M-14 mags from the M-16 after he was a pistol in the boss fight.

362
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's hitting all the beats of this sequence in the game, but it's messed with the story too much to make it feel the same.

363
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Because the point was that, like, you might actually be convinced that the fireflies have a shot.

364
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Marlene's pretty delusional, and she's not a great person, but they're trying, you know?

365
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
They tried too hard to make Marlene likeable in this, to make this work.

366
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because it had to be like an evil versus evil scenario.

367
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Not to mention, they haven't even talked anything about a cure now, or they're closed or anything.

368
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
They've just said, oh, we're going to cut up in our head because, you know, we figure this might work.

369
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Like, we have a theory that the cordycept might be living in her head.

370
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We've got a theory that it might cause her to be immune. Okay.

371
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I won't let you take her.

372
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yep, that was a pretty bad move, doc.

373
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Cover her arm. Fast.

374
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Turn around.

375
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Now remember, just because they're nurses doesn't mean they're innocent. Bang bang.

376
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Actually, I think he did kill them in the game.

377
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Like, Joel just single-handedly whipped up the fireflies. He killed all of them. There were no more left.

378
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Pen to the doctor because he's the hero.

379
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Nope. Ask the doctors.

380
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Well, I think they panned to the doctor because the doctor was a friend of Abby in the second game, which is, like, this event is why Abby goes after him for revenge.

381
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's Abby's father.

382
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You're going to do something different with Abby. One of the nurses is going to be her or something.

383
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh, okay.

384
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean, you should have shot them too. There's no reason why they couldn't grab a gun and go after you, and you'd be pretty helpless carrying Ellie around.

385
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah, considering these people were willing to murder children, you can't really trust them.

386
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So, that entire grand show down there lasted for about four minutes.

387
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And it was super lame.

388
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't know, I don't have it yet.

389
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Can't keep herself from a boss fight.

390
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I think she'd want to do what's right.

391
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What's right?

392
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm sure she's the hero now.

393
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You've killed everyone.

394
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The doctor's fucking gone.

395
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No, you can't. Like, your brain surgeon is dead surgeon.

396
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No.

397
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Bang.

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Bang.

399
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What? No, shoot her.

400
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This is going to be more to the game, because she doesn't know what happened.

401
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The doctors, they couldn't make any of it work.

402
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
She puts down her gun so that she can be extra reasonable, and there comes the shot.

403
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They've stopped looking for a cure.

404
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Wow, he got his hand out real quick.

405
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay, that was not how he was holding that gun, but okay.

406
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
No.

407
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Because he would have held that hid underneath her robe and then fired it through the robe.

408
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh, we've got to make her look even more villainous.

409
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah, because she's wounded.

410
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Put my gun down, how could you do this?

411
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Pedro, no care.

412
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Pedro, put your gun down.

413
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Sure.

414
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
He's justified.

415
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Wow, they botched that whole sequence.

416
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That was pretty bad.

417
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So much was done wrong.

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The look of it was correct, completely, but everything was done wrong.

419
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Because now Ellie can learn the horrible secret.

420
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, Joel killed all those people.

421
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, there was totally a cure.

422
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, Joel, why are you Joel, bad person, Joel?

423
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah, I mean, the final shot of the game is Ellie asking Joel, did you actually kill everyone?

424
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And Joel says no, and then the game ends.

425
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I want to point out a slight plot hole here introduced by the whole retcon at the beginning.

426
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Black Chick knows why Ellie's immune now.

427
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
We can manage that.

428
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
She knows that her mother was bitten while pregnant.

429
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So all they would have to do is literally get pregnant women and infect them with the cordyceps and voila.

430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yep.

431
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They have the cure.

432
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
They could make as many babies as they wanted to with this.

433
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah, like if you wanted to be really brutal about it, you could just infect every single woman who gets pregnant.

434
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And then you have a generation of people who are probably the right one.

435
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
They're pretty fucked up.

436
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Like, OK, yeah, there would be some work to be done here, like on the timing, et cetera.

437
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But this is absolutely something they could do.

438
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Like they have the way to at the very least make more people that they can dissect for a proper cure.

439
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So they have the means to do this.

440
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
They don't need Ellie.

441
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I'm not saying that you're not girly.

442
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah, that's true.

443
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Absolutely.

444
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
They've had this.

445
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
How old is Ellie?

446
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Fourteen.

447
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
They've had this knowledge for fourteen years.

448
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Hold on a second.

449
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
They didn't know that she was immune, I guess, before she got bitten.

450
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

451
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I think you would have made her laugh.

452
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But still, they have this knowledge.

453
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's not like Blackjack forgot about how she was born.

454
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
They could have just been like, oh, Ellie is immune.

455
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We could recreate this somewhere else in a different Firefly base.

456
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah, hold on, why is she immune?

457
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh, that's right, her mother said that she totally cut the cord before she was bit.

458
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Come.

459
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Dot's not connecting your beep, beep, beep.

460
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
She just forgot, I guess.

461
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That's okay.

462
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
They just sort of forgot about that whole armada.

463
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah, it wasn't a very traumatizing event or anything.

464
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Killing her best friend for life.

465
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Promising to take care of her daughter.

466
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh, this is the...

467
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
When I got bit in the mall, I wasn't on my own.

468
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It was actually my lesbian friend.

469
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Here we go.

470
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies is true.

471
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I swear.

472
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Okay.

473
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And end.

474
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, God.

475
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, that was a waste of my fucking time.

476
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I mean, so they had the sets, again, looking just like the game.

477
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The very well-known moments and lines.

478
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The shots were blocked the same way.

479
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The lines were the same. They were delivered the same.

480
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Even though it's by different actors, they delivered the lines the same way.

481
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But they messed up so much of the underpinning of the story that it just completely fell apart.

482
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It just lost all meaning.

483
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It just means nothing.

484
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
All the sacrifice, all the things that Joel did have been devalued or changed to fit the sequel.

485
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So that they can continue to milk this setting.

486
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Even though it was just like a one-shot story to begin with.

487
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Because everything has to be a franchise.

488
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We've got to keep milking it.

489
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Can't just leave it be.

490
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The original purpose of the game basically was, as you play through, you notice that Joel does more and more violent and...

491
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
violent, immoral things in the service of keeping Ellie safe.

492
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And then by the end, he's completely willing to just kill all of the Fireflies and completely destroy their movement.

493
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Even though the game makes it clear that it's not 100%, but there's a decent chance that this might work.

494
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And that Ellie... The show didn't make this clear.

495
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The game makes it clear that Ellie wants to do it, even if it kills her.

496
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The game makes it very clear that she's willing to die, but Joel's not willing to let her go.

497
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So Joel kills them all, he lies to her about it, and that sets up the conflict of the second game.

498
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
At least part of the conflict of the second game between Joel and Ellie.

499
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But the point is to watch Joel not go crazy, but turn evil as he tries to defend this girl.

500
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And they've undermined that entire plot.

501
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
They've undermined it consistently throughout the whole season.

502
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know. I just... This show... Bad.

503
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah, it went from... Before we were saying, this is a mediocre show.

504
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah, in the beginning it was like, half-decent.

505
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And then like, this ending was just like, oh man.

506
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Before we started this recording today, we talked about bad shows and how they just leave an awful taste in your mouth.

507
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
This show has reached that point too, where it's like, yeah, it just feels like Halo, feels like the rest of them.

508
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Feels just like a complete disservice to the entire setting and story.

509
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah, if you knew what The Last of Us Part 1 was supposed to be about, the first game,

510
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
once you get to this point, once you get to the finale of this season, it's all come apart.

511
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And it is just as bad as those bad shows, because they ruined everything in the end.

512
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I guess it wasn't actually the good show after all, Arch.

513
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
We were deceived, Arch did it.

514
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
For me, this was never particularly interesting. It's a zombie show without the zombies. I'm like, okay.

515
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I wanted to see the zombies. I don't care about these stupid humans and their fucking lives, frankly.

516
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And the two humans I did care about barely got any fucking screen time.

517
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And in the end, when they're supposed to be the grand finale for the two humans I did kind of care about,

518
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
they spent, let me check here, they spent 13 minutes of the 43 minute episode waffling about

519
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
until Joel goes all fucking postal for less than four minutes, two minutes action sequence.

520
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And then that's it. The thing is done. It's over. We're on to second season now.

521
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And I hated the Fireflies too, because that scene, I was sitting there and I was debating,

522
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
should I say it? Should I be like, oh, she puts down the gun and he shoots her?

523
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But I'm like, nah, nah, that would be too fucking stupid.

524
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That would be too goddamn cringe and dumb. And there we are.

525
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Because suddenly the Fireflies are the good guys and they're not the good guys.

526
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Listen to what they're saying. They have no idea if this will work.

527
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
They have a wild theory that the mushroom in her head is totally protecting her from the other mushrooms,

528
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
even though the other mushrooms attack her on sight.

529
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
They have no evidence of this. They haven't drawn her blood.

530
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
They haven't tested her biology. They haven't done lab tests on this or anything.

531
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
They're like, well, her mushroom in her head, like make chemicals that scares the other mushrooms.

532
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So we're just going to pop her open like a pumpkin and see what happens.

533
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And if she dies, well, she dies.

534
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That is not a good thing to do. And then she's like, we could save them all, Joel.

535
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But her dad like, no, Joel is in the writing because Joel has something to protect.

536
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
They have a ludicrous fucking theory. They have no basis for believing any of this shit.

537
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yep. They've just been chopping up kids with little to no results.

538
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And again, because they added in that retcon, we now know that they know why she's immune.

539
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yep. Yep. So they had no reason to have her.

540
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It was far more complicated to get her to do that than to literally capture some women, forcibly impregnate them, then infect them, and then kill them, and then basically take the babies at the right time.

541
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Their whole organization, they put two and two together here and be like, okay, Ellie, so we've got a goddamn hospital here. We've got electricity.

542
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We can run some tests on you. You can analyze your blood. Probably maybe even do like head scans or something. I don't know how much shit they have.

543
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But she should be the baseline test patient so that they can recreate whatever is happening in her.

544
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Busting her head open first over, well, we do kind of think her mushroom special.

545
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah. Yeah. That's also not how any of this shit works ever.

546
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Like just chopping somebody up instantly on the board is like, okay, you take the one person you have that is immune to this thing. You just killed them.

547
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And you figured out nothing. And you've done that before. You admitted that you've done that before and it failed before.

548
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then you've not only done it once, but you've done it multiple times. Here's the rare opportunity presented yet again with like the eight other times with another person who so happens to be immune.

549
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Maybe we should try a different tactic. No, put on a table, chop them up. Oh, good. They died again. Like nothing happened.

550
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:58,000
At least in the games, they had done this several times before. They'd built up a database. They had a reasonable indication that what they were doing were correct.

551
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Because, you know, that's that's trial and error. You do it, you test a thing and it didn't work. Okay, try again. Like they had a basis here.

552
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That entire thing is like, well, you know, probably we chop up children and like nothing happens, but we just keep doing it.

553
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It's also bad. And again, the way they should. This is Hollywood 101, where they're beating you over the head, like sympathize to these people.

554
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
God damn you filthy viewer. You're stupid enough to be affected by a sad violin, right?

555
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Look at Joel's executing the poor fat guy who just wanted to kill a child. I just want to kill a kid.

556
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
We've done it like several times before. I'm totally a good guy, too.

557
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Marlene's like, yeah, we've killed children. You know, we're going to keep doing it until we find a cure. It's like, OK.

558
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't really buy it. I don't really buy it. Like it's too forced. It's too it's too much like they're trying to get you to sympathize with these characters that are clearly wrong.

559
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Every bit of shred of evidence they've suggested has already proven to me that it doesn't work.

560
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
If you've killed multiple people to try to figure out how this, you know, cure thing works or inoculation and it's failed every single time.

561
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You can't convince me that just keep chopping up more people is going to magically a failure is going to turn from, you know, to a success.

562
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's like trying to change, you know, something that physically can't be changed. It's not the right it's not the right method.

563
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So, Arch, are you going to I mean, The Last of Us is on Steam. You can play the you can play it now and see how good the actual game was.

564
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Hold on. Yeah. Thank you for suggesting that I hurt myself. Very nice of you. Very friendly.

565
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
One thing is, Dev, is The Last of Us remake going to follow the retcons to try to facilitate, too?

566
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Oh, it probably will. You know what? Because they had to like change a few things to make part two and they're going to like retcon once they do the remake of part one.

567
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yep. Because that's a remake. They're not actually just going to give you The Last of Us on PC.

568
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
They're going to give you The Last of Us part one, which means that the thing is when The Last of Us came out and I own the original Last of Us copy.

569
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
This doesn't say part one on it. No, it says The Last of Us.

570
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's a one time video game with a one time story. It's a one shot product. That's it.

571
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's not a trilogy. It's not anything. It's just a pretend little thing. And it's like, nope, they got to milk it. They got to make it Last of Us part two.

572
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Well, here's the thing. Yeah, The Last of Us came out in the PS3 and then on the PS4 it came out, it got remastered.

573
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So it was still the same game. And then you had, now it's being rereleased, remade as Last of Us part one to make it fit with the new lore.

574
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You know what, they've ruined the whole thing. It's all fucking, you know what, here. I'm just going to message Lilith real quick.

575
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Hey, Lilith, you're actually in luck that you couldn't make it tonight. This was awful. Lucky her. Lucky her.

576
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah. I think, for each reference Dev, I think I've been called into work, even though I'm not employed anywhere.

577
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But, you know, I must go.

578
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Hey, I came back in real quick. I just thought of something.

579
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah, nothing. This whole fucking recording doesn't matter. I'm going to lock Dev out of here. Damn!

580
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I just thought of something big. All right?

581
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay, better be fucking big.

582
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I had to share this.

583
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
All right, fair enough.

584
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The whole Ellie's mother was bit while pregnant thing. It doesn't just ruin this episode. It doesn't just ruin Marlene's motivation. It ruins the entire trip.

585
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Because think about it, like Marlene...

586
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh my God, Dev, come here. I'm going to strangle you. We've already established this.

587
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Think back to the first episode though, okay? Marlene's bleeding out of her side and she's like, this is our only hope, dude.

588
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Joel, I don't trust you, but you gotta, you gotta take Ellie. What do you mean? What do you mean? The whole show is meaningless.

589
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yes. Correct.

590
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Oh my God.

591
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I thought we were already on the same page.

592
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I was talking with Naomi about it and I realized, oh my God, this is more than just this episode. It's everything.

593
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah.

594
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The whole show has been ruined.

595
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
All I think I've just realized is Dev never listens to me when I talk.

596
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sorry.

597
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I think that's because I told you that and you agreed with me.

598
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
All right. I'm sorry guys. Have fun, okay?

599
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Okay. I'll fucking never forgive. I'll never forgive this.
