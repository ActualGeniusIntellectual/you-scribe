0	15000	Welcome to the final episode everyone. No Lilith today, unfortunately. She got called in to work. She's not here. I kind of envy her. She doesn't have to watch The Last of Us.
15000	21000	What does she really call in to work? Like, we have to ask ourselves.
21000	25000	It's not Rings of Power.
25000	29000	Yeah, it's not that bad. As you said last time, Arch, this was The Good Show.
29000	33000	Yes, this is as good as modern entertainment is likely to get.
33000	40000	You see how he's trying to twist you, Arch. He's trying to say, oh, it's The Good Show. But he's leaving out the context.
40000	43000	Compared to Velma or She-Hulk.
43000	48000	Lilith still appears on my channel in the TUBcast and we'll get her in for something else down the road, I'm sure.
48000	56000	She's spared the finale. And, okay, it's really strange that the finale is episode 9.
56000	63000	You know what I mean? I've seen seasons be 8 episodes, 10 episodes, 12 episodes, not 9 episodes.
63000	66000	Yeah, it's kind of a weird spot to end it.
66000	69000	Considering this feels like it needs more.
69000	70000	Yes.
70000	72000	Like, 12 episodes would help.
72000	85000	Yeah, if this show had 3 more episodes, they could have done their 2 flashback bits just fine and filled out the rest of the actual content of the show and everyone would have been happy.
85000	90000	But this show feels like it wasted too much time and now it's rushing to the end.
90000	94000	That's true.
94000	108000	Also, Arch, I was reading the comments on your channel since, for those of you who only watch my channel, Arch and Kibz go do a podcast about this after we do the React video.
108000	120000	I was reading comments on your channel, Arch, and some people were saying that all the big YouTube channels that cover this sort of thing, like Nerdronic and guys like that, they all gave this show up 2 or 3 episodes in.
120000	125000	I'm made of sterner stuff than soft, genteel persons like this.
125000	130000	That's true. We've endured lots of really bad shows.
131000	139000	Joking aside, this isn't that bad. It's bland. Sure, it's mediocre. Yeah, it's not that interesting.
139000	149000	But this ain't no Obi-Wan Kenobi. This doesn't hurt. There's no Wellma where I watch the episodes and I'm in pain.
149000	153000	It's just a long series of insults.
153000	159000	It hurts. It physically hurts to be there. It's like, oh, I think I want to die.
159000	165000	Well, those other channels that they did watch all of Kenobi and they did they did watch Velma, they did watch whatever it was. Right.
165000	170000	But also a lot of them skipped Andor. Andor too was just very mediocre. Yeah.
170000	178000	So I think I think they're there. Those guys are just focusing on the the really bad shows because they know like so.
178000	186000	But it's not necessarily so bad. It's good. It's more like so bad. It's content. Meanwhile, The Last of Us isn't so bad as content.
186000	190000	It's just it's just kind of there, you know, doing it primarily for the clicks.
190000	195000	And I mean, we're all doing it for the clicks. But once you've started a series.
195000	199000	Yeah, you got to finish. You got to finish. I actually completely agree with you on that.
199000	204000	If I if I wasn't like that, I probably would have given this one up, too, because it's not it's just not that interesting.
204000	212000	It's not it's not even like it's not bad on a technical level. It's it's it's woke, but it's not ridiculously so.
212000	217000	It's not it hasn't spun off into absurdity yet. It's just kind of there, you know.
217000	222000	Just meh. We're going to start it right now. Let's go for the finale.
222000	231000	This is new, I think. TV show. You are not going to take another fucking deviation right now.
231000	236000	Surely. Yeah, this doesn't look familiar at all.
236000	242000	You don't remember a pregnant woman running through a forest. Nope.
242000	250000	It's like here's another filler episode. You know, it seems like a bad idea to get pregnant in the apocalypse.
250000	257000	It does. Yeah. You might want to keep it down.
257000	261000	I know that's going to be a goddamn impossible. Yeah.
261000	268000	You know, childbirth, it's a three on the pain scale, not like stubbing your toe or anything.
268000	273000	Oh, for God's sake. That's Ellie's night.
273000	282000	Now, is this Ellie's mother or something? Is the reason why she's immune because the zombie bit mommy just as she was being popped out?
282000	286000	If so, this is completely new and this is made up bullshit.
286000	300000	Yep. Because the implication was it was just like a random genetic defect or not defect, you know, mutation that made her immune.
300000	305000	Oh, that just kind of sort of happened, I guess. She got lucky. I didn't even notice.
305000	313000	That was quick and easy. Wow. Childbirth really is a two out of 10 on the pain scale.
313000	317000	Oh, and she has been. Oh, God, no, please don't tell me this is some gay record.
317000	323000	Yep, it is because now that will be fed into the baby via the little umbilical cord.
323000	328000	Oh, my God. And she used the same knife that she just stabbed the clicker with or whatever.
328000	333000	That's a brain dead move. Oh, to be fair, what else did you have? She was going to chew it off.
333000	339000	I mean, let's wipe it off on the fabric, you know, maybe. Well, maybe.
339000	348000	So you now have like a day or two to find someone to take this baby, because if you don't get that baby somewhere else.
348000	353000	You're going to eat it. Also, how on God is good greed? This is the one of them.
353000	358000	OK, let's hear it for a second. Oh, no, that is a retcon.
358000	362000	It's a retcon. Wow.
362000	366000	Pause there for a second. I just want to. OK, hold on.
366000	377000	All right. What's up, Arch? I just wanted to see if that zombie was even ever near her thighs to bite her.
377000	383000	Yep, because this is something this show does constantly. Like people are suddenly they look down and they're like,
383000	388000	Oh, my God, I'm wounded. When the zombie was never even close to it. There's never a scene where it's like,
388000	393000	yeah, because they do the jump cuts and it's like, look, we cut so much. Oh, I can't believe it got so fast.
393000	399000	It's like, yeah, you're so you're so bad at visual storytelling, you don't even show it.
399000	404000	Well, it kind of bent off in the general direction of her thigh for a second.
404000	409000	Not anywhere close enough to bite her on the thigh, but at least they kind of pretended.
409000	415000	They put the vague effort forward. Yes, there was an effort made better than the previous one.
415000	424000	All right. That was five minutes of the crucial super densely packed last episode wasted on a retcon origin story.
424000	430000	Great. Good. That does nothing to the actual story whatsoever, because this information is literally not important.
430000	434000	Good job. Utterly irrelevant. Let's go.
434000	440000	Just to retcon a few things here. It's like you've already convinced me that she has these powers.
440000	445000	I frankly don't care or need to know where she got them from. Well, it doesn't matter.
445000	450000	It's not the point of the story. It's a waste of time. I just hate it.
450000	458000	The show uses time so poorly. I guess they're just relying on the fact that we've got two seasons, I guess.
458000	464000	Yep. Oh, that's right. They're going to just drag it out. Well, the second season is the second game, though.
464000	468000	What? Really? They've already confirmed that. Yeah. That's horrific.
468000	475000	Yeah. They've already confirmed. I do not want to watch the second season, Dev. They've already confirmed the second season is the second game.
475000	480000	And I looked it up in terms of the game's storyline.
480000	491000	After the cannibal cultists, they have the final confrontation with the fireflies and then they go back to Tommy's commune for the finale.
491000	496000	So we're at the end of the game already. Yeah, I know we're I know this is like the end.
496000	503000	But it was like I was like wondering, like, OK, they got on the season, but they I thought they said they weren't going to do that because, you know, nobody would like that.
503000	506000	Then I forget that Neil Druckmann is the executive producer.
506000	513000	Yes. Oh, it all makes sense because he hates women. And the girl who wrote this, he hates his guts.
513000	519000	So he needs to completely destroy everything she made. I keep forgetting that. Listen, I keep forgetting that.
519000	522000	Cibs, you can't make Neil Druckmann sound that based.
522000	528000	Neil Druckmann hates women. I don't know if I'm willing to give him that W, Kyle.
528000	533000	Sorry, but like the reason why he's doing what he's doing is because he hates the writer of the show so much or the game.
533000	542000	Oh, God, no. So this is going to be them who is going to find the baby and they're going to kill the mother just this before she bites her thigh.
542000	546000	This is so stupid. This retcon is so dumb. It makes no sense.
546000	550000	That's the Firefly leader, right? This never happens. This is all new.
550000	553000	This is made up bullshit. Help me.
553000	559000	Like this, this is not necessarily a TV show.
559000	562000	It's the unnecessary desire to tether everything together.
562000	569000	Star Wars had this problem, too, where it's like every every little side character in the background of every stupid shot is like some important thing.
569000	573000	So everything has to be connected because that's just shitty writing.
573000	582000	So is the story going to be that that the Firefly guys took Ellie and gave her to Fedra and then took her back?
582000	591000	But only randomly because she she ran away with her girlfriend that one night.
591000	596000	Oh, but her mother was a Firefly, I guess. I guess this is all new.
596000	602000	That's why they took her in. And that's why they put her to give her to Fedra of all people.
602000	606000	She needs to be fed.
606000	614000	And I'm basically a mushroom. Yeah.
614000	620000	I got it before I was bit.
620000	623000	Before. You liar.
623000	627000	I don't want you to give her this.
627000	634000	Don't just put it. The baby is going to actually hit the spring and just knife itself.
634000	640000	All you know, it's just a very valuable is that we've known each other.
640000	644000	Do they get is that the original voice actors right there?
644000	649000	Oh, yeah, Kelly.
649000	653000	This wreck on stupid crap right now.
653000	660000	Yeah, it sounds like Ellie.
660000	666000	OK, I appreciate the idea of wanting to get the characters in as a little bit of a tribute to patrol homage thing.
666000	671000	But the reckoning is pointless. Why don't you just make the prize the original rules?
671000	678000	Well, she's obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, this was originally going to be a movie.
678000	685000	I looked up on the Internet. This is going to be a movie based better.
685000	693000	Please, please, please.
693000	696000	This is going to be a movie.
696000	705000	And the reason that it's the project switched was because a bunch of the actresses they wanted for Ellie all age out of the role,
705000	720000	they were trying to make it. Cover her ears.
720000	728000	She's a baby.
728000	733000	Now, look, the fireflies are based in good now.
733000	738000	Ten minutes of wasted time with the climax.
738000	747000	So you know, Druckmann can justify his retcons.
747000	753000	That was stupid and a waste of our time. This is the last time you guys will see that forehead.
753000	760000	I'll think, fuck, it's so big. Yeah, her performance grew on me.
760000	765000	But her forehead didn't. No, it grew on it.
765000	768000	Where else would you hear me?
768000	773000	No, what I found this in there.
773000	775000	B for Roni, Chef Boyardee.
775000	781000	That transition looked like what was going on was she was thinking back to the time she was one day old.
781000	784000	Have you ever played this? Getting close.
784000	789000	And again, we've completely skipped the nursing him back to health thing.
789000	795000	That never happened. It's just, God, that was supposed to be a bonding event.
795000	797000	It's spring now.
797000	800000	It would have been a good character growing moment for Ellie, too.
800000	804000	It would show all the things she'd learned from Joel.
804000	810000	But no, she'd stabbed him in the stomach twice with them penicillin, and then he killed the town.
810000	818000	Wait, even after they bonded, Joel wasn't like this chummy with her.
818000	823000	It's almost like he's sucking up to her.
823000	829000	That'd be great. He's thanking her for saving his bacon, I guess.
829000	834000	I'm sure Neil Druckmann had some words to say.
834000	841000	It's tainted. It's basically a pedo show now. I'm sad.
841000	844000	They both seem off now.
845000	847000	Their character interactions feel wrong.
847000	849000	Come on, I'll give you a boost.
853000	859000	I'm sorry, Joel. I'm distracted by memories of my mother, who I totally remember.
859000	864000	That's what this flashback is about. I'm going to talk about my mom.
864000	866000	Yeah, fine.
866000	869000	Just you kind of seem extra quiet today, so...
869000	871000	Oh, I'm sorry.
871000	876000	Extra quiet? Oh, yes, because she's usually so very demure.
880000	883000	Yeah, she's very chatty, actually.
883000	885000	Show.
885000	888000	I guess the show forgot her character for a bit there.
888000	892000	I think they forgot a lot of things the more they get into this.
893000	895000	Whoa.
896000	898000	Damn it, Ellie!
898000	902000	Okay, I guess she got retarded, too.
902000	904000	I'm glad you see this!
904000	906000	Ellie!
906000	908000	Up here!
908000	909000	Ellie!
909000	910000	Come on!
910000	912000	Jesus.
912000	916000	What is wrong with the writing? Holy shit.
916000	918000	Ellie!
918000	920000	This is a post-apocalyptic situation.
920000	926000	You're running through a building you've never been in, all excited around corners and rooms you've never seen before.
927000	932000	Just out of curiosity, this isn't reminiscent of the game, is it?
932000	933000	No.
933000	938000	Yeah, I have a sneaking suspicion this is them running out of game and trying to right-throw themselves.
938000	941000	No, I think this scene was unique, though, wasn't it?
941000	943000	Yes, the zoo animals. Okay.
943000	949000	Yeah, they skipped the actual entry into the city. They made that all different, but then there's the zoo animals part.
949000	951000	I will.
951000	955000	Yeah, I do remember this thing. The giraffe. I don't know why I said thing.
955000	957000	What are you doing?
957000	959000	It's all right.
959000	961000	Come here, hurry up. Come on.
961000	966000	The writer wanted to reference Jurassic Park, okay? The brachiosaur scene.
967000	970000	Na na na na na.
970000	972000	Na na na. Yeah.
972000	975000	John Williams makes good music.
975000	982000	Now, the way into the city was through, like, a flooded bypass tunnel that had a bunch of clickers in it.
983000	985000	But they just skipped all the exits.
985000	987000	Yeah, it's video gaming.
987000	988000	Yeah.
988000	990000	That might be fun to watch.
990000	992000	Wouldn't want that.
992000	995000	We need to see a birthing scene that didn't matter.
996000	1004000	All right, almost 20 minutes of this final super important episode finale.
1004000	1005000	Yeah.
1005000	1010000	The only things that have happened is a retcon and a giraffe being fed.
1012000	1018000	Also, Kibs, listen, I've seen your thumbnails on your channel. I know that pregnancy is your fetish, buddy.
1018000	1020000	That's true.
1020000	1022000	That's false. That was a meme.
1022000	1025000	That wasn't a meme. I know the person. He liked it.
1026000	1027000	What?
1027000	1029000	He requested it. I know the guy who drew it.
1029000	1030000	So?
1031000	1032000	Is it everything you hoped for?
1032000	1033000	What?
1033000	1035000	Yeah, I requested it because it's a meme.
1038000	1041000	See? Your narrative falls apart. That's all it is.
1042000	1045000	Don't worry, Kyle. I don't judge you for having a preggo fetish.
1045000	1046000	The fuck?
1048000	1050000	Look, I don't know exactly where this hospital is.
1050000	1051000	Yeah, we'll find it.
1052000	1054000	Sure. It's just...
1058000	1062000	Maybe there's nothing bad out there, but so far there's always been something bad out there.
1063000	1064000	We're still here, though.
1064000	1065000	I know.
1066000	1068000	But remarkably few zombies.
1069000	1070000	It can't be for nothing.
1075000	1077000	It will be, though. That's the plot twist.
1077000	1083000	This is what we in the biz refer to as the establishing death flag scene.
1084000	1087000	After we're done, we'll totally go and do cool things.
1088000	1091000	You'll not have a golf club hit your head, Joel. What?
1093000	1095000	What golf club? Nothing.
1096000	1106000	So, there's a YouTube channel called Fee that did a short little video describing why Tommy's city, Jacksonville I think it was, was not actually communism.
1107000	1109000	And it's more like how the Amish lived.
1110000	1111000	Yeah. It was a good video.
1112000	1121000	It was a good video, yeah. But basically, it lacks the coercive elements because everyone voluntarily comes together.
1122000	1123000	And people can leave whenever they want.
1124000	1126000	But that's what true communism is.
1127000	1128000	That's true. That isn't communism.
1129000	1132000	So the show lied. The show's been trying to make things into communism.
1133000	1136000	That is the communist's view of communism.
1137000	1140000	Except they don't let you leave and they kill your entire family.
1141000	1144000	Well, what's funny though is that in the game they didn't call it communism.
1145000	1150000	It was just a collectively owned city because you had to because it was the apocalypse.
1151000	1152000	Because they needed to survive.
1153000	1156000	But this is the current year and there's politics to be had.
1157000	1158000	Yeah, narratives to be said.
1163000	1164000	Wow, it's Chaz.
1167000	1169000	Oh my god, I forgot what that was.
1170000	1172000	That's a blast from the past.
1182000	1183000	Yep.
1185000	1186000	I think that's new too.
1188000	1189000	They keep making stuff up, don't they?
1198000	1200000	I wasn't scared either. I was ready.
1201000	1202000	Yeah, this is all new.
1203000	1207000	So I decided to put a gun to the side of my head and shoot upwards.
1209000	1211000	Okay. Joe, you're a tard.
1212000	1215000	I think they're breaking his character in front of us.
1216000	1221000	Yeah, they're undermining him because he needs to be weaker.
1222000	1223000	I still don't know why.
1223000	1228000	They've broken him in body because of his panic attack, now they break him in spirit because he gave up.
1229000	1231000	I don't know why you're telling me all this.
1232000	1233000	Yep.
1234000	1235000	I reckon you do.
1236000	1239000	I don't think Sarah was brought up again between these two after that one scene.
1240000	1242000	That's why that one scene in the bedroom was so important.
1243000	1246000	Yep, because this devalues it too.
1247000	1254000	The Last of Us confirms Joel's attempt at suicide, so it was not mentioned explicitly in the game as far as I can see.
1255000	1260000	Also, I don't care if you flinch, if you've got a gun to your head, you can flinch as much as you want.
1261000	1263000	That 800 meters per second bullet ain't gonna fucking care, bruh.
1264000	1266000	I flinched a little, but the bullet caught up.
1268000	1270000	In fact, the flinching was because of the bullet.
1271000	1282000	So, I know we were talking through it, but he just said that Ellie is basically the replacement Sarah, and obviously Ellie is the replacement Sarah, but he never said it in the game.
1283000	1284000	Shitty puns.
1285000	1286000	Is this something you don't say?
1287000	1288000	They expect you to think for yourself.
1290000	1291000	No, the game had a better writer.
1296000	1297000	Uh-huh.
1298000	1299000	That's topical.
1300000	1303000	That's one. Moon rocks taste better than Earth rocks. Why?
1304000	1305000	Because they're meteor...
1306000	1307000	Oh, that's terrible. That's a...
1308000	1309000	That's a zero out of ten.
1310000	1311000	These are pretty good, by the way.
1313000	1315000	Yeah, but that other scene was, like, peeing on me.
1316000	1317000	Some man.
1318000	1319000	That was a three out of ten.
1320000	1321000	Uh-oh.
1322000	1323000	Yep, I know. I've been watching them do that.
1324000	1325000	Help me!
1329000	1331000	Wow. That was the dumbest way this could have happened.
1332000	1339000	Remember, he needs to fail. He cannot be successful or competent. He cannot be the one who brings her there in the end.
1340000	1345000	Well, if this next part is like the game, he's about to be extremely competent.
1347000	1348000	We'll see about that.
1349000	1351000	But according to the retcon, he murdered some innocent people.
1351000	1352000	You got here pretty hard.
1353000	1354000	Oh, there she is.
1355000	1357000	Five men. His only job was to protect him. He has still almost got killed.
1358000	1359000	How'd she do it?
1361000	1362000	It was all her.
1363000	1364000	She felt like hell to get here.
1365000	1366000	She's being prepped for surgery.
1369000	1370000	But you said she wasn't hurt.
1373000	1374000	Our doctor...
1375000	1377000	He thinks that the cordyceps anelli has grown with her since birth.
1378000	1379000	Why is she in surgery?
1379000	1385000	It produces a kind of chemical messenger. It makes normal cordyceps think that she's cordyceps. It's why she's immune.
1386000	1389000	He's going to remove it from her, multiply the cells in the lab...
1390000	1391000	That's stupid.
1392000	1394000	Because if that was the case, the zombies wouldn't attack her either.
1395000	1396000	Yep.
1397000	1398000	He thinks it could be a cure, Joel.
1399000	1400000	This is bullshit.
1401000	1404000	Well, it sounds like an inoculation, not a cure, but still.
1406000	1408000	Cordyceps grows inside the brain.
1409000	1413000	It does.
1417000	1419000	And if you kill the only person that has this...
1420000	1421000	There is no one else.
1422000	1424000	We didn't tell her. We can cause her any fear. There won't be any pain.
1425000	1427000	No, you take me to her. You take me to her right now!
1435000	1436000	It's for the greater good, Joel.
1437000	1438000	You don't understand.
1440000	1442000	I do.
1443000	1445000	I was there when she was born, Joel.
1446000	1448000	No, you fucking weren't. God damn it.
1449000	1453000	I was the black woman hero. You weren't, Joel.
1454000	1458000	They're trying to make her seem not monstrous when she was pretty monstrous in the end.
1459000	1462000	Yep, because she's black and they have to do that to make him look bad because he's a white man.
1463000	1464000	I know.
1464000	1474000	In the original story, you could find a log where they had done this on several other immune people before, and it didn't work, and they were just grasping at straws.
1475000	1478000	It fails every time, because it doesn't do anything.
1479000	1482000	Yeah, but Marlene was basically just like, no, it's going to work this time. We have to do it again.
1483000	1489000	Yep, that's why the last was part two, basically. They tried to paint it the other way, like, no, no, it would have worked. This time it's different.
1490000	1491000	He tries anything.
1491000	1494000	Last time wasn't really communism, guys.
1495000	1497000	Also, he's not even getting paid.
1498000	1500000	No, she's going to hit the desk.
1501000	1504000	Isn't that another retcon? Because I thought he got two options in the game.
1505000	1506000	Yeah.
1507000	1509000	To get paid or to leave.
1510000	1512000	Oh, she's crying because she's the real victim.
1517000	1519000	Marlene is a villain, by the way.
1519000	1531000	I think in the game, basically, they had killed the others, and they didn't get enough data to recreate it, but they were almost there, and they just needed Ellie's brain to finally finish the vaccine.
1532000	1535000	Well, that's what they claimed. They probably said that about the last children they killed, too.
1536000	1544000	Thirty minutes. We are almost out of time in this episode, and nothing has happened.
1545000	1547000	Oh, wow, Jesus.
1548000	1550000	They've wasted so much time.
1551000	1555000	They're going to have to rush through this fucking rescue awfully quick, or just end it on a...
1556000	1560000	Ugh, not just stop it on a cliffhanger. That would be the worst thing.
1566000	1568000	You know, I'm pretty sure she heard those gunshots.
1569000	1570000	Yep.
1570000	1571000	Help her!
1576000	1577000	Joel's a monster.
1577000	1578000	Ammo.
1578000	1580000	They were innocent people, what do you see?
1580000	1582000	They just wanted to kill children for fun.
1583000	1594000	Well, the way it was set up in the game is basically like, at this point, Joel's destroyed multiple cities in defense of Ellie, and now he's going to destroy the cure in defense of Ellie.
1595000	1603000	Also, I want to point out, he grabbed a magazine from what appeared to be an AR-15 or M-16. I bet you he's going to reload that M-14 with that.
1605000	1609000	Yep, they're going out of their way to make him look super fucked up and evil.
1611000	1614000	Well, that's actually pretty close to the... Yeah, there it is, Archie.
1614000	1616000	Yep, yep, he's... beautiful.
1616000	1617000	God dammit.
1617000	1630000	So, that's actually kind of the point of the game, though, Kip, is that by the end of the game, Joel was just doing blatantly immoral things in defense of Ellie. So that tracks.
1637000	1638000	He'll kill them.
1639000	1647000	Oh great, another M-16 AR-15 to reload my M-14 with, yeah. They both start with M, don't they?
1648000	1652000	This is... they've somehow managed to make the sequence super lame with the music.
1655000	1656000	It's like...
1656000	1657000	He's so evil, guys.
1657000	1659000	The thing is, right now they're just telling...
1659000	1660000	Right now they're just telling...
1666000	1672000	It's like, this should not be a sad violin music. This should be a fucking rock moment.
1675000	1679000	He is killing the bad people. These are not the heroes of this story.
1680000	1682000	Yeah, we've already established that the fireflies aren't good.
1682000	1685000	The show fucks up its final act, wonderful.
1686000	1694000	Run out of M-14 mags from the M-16 after he was a pistol in the boss fight.
1695000	1702000	It's hitting all the beats of this sequence in the game, but it's messed with the story too much to make it feel the same.
1703000	1707000	Because the point was that, like, you might actually be convinced that the fireflies have a shot.
1707000	1712000	Marlene's pretty delusional, and she's not a great person, but they're trying, you know?
1713000	1717000	They tried too hard to make Marlene likeable in this, to make this work.
1718000	1720000	Because it had to be like an evil versus evil scenario.
1721000	1725000	Not to mention, they haven't even talked anything about a cure now, or they're closed or anything.
1726000	1730000	They've just said, oh, we're going to cut up in our head because, you know, we figure this might work.
1731000	1733000	Like, we have a theory that the cordycept might be living in her head.
1733000	1737000	We've got a theory that it might cause her to be immune. Okay.
1738000	1739000	I won't let you take her.
1743000	1745000	Yep, that was a pretty bad move, doc.
1749000	1751000	Cover her arm. Fast.
1756000	1757000	Turn around.
1758000	1764000	Now remember, just because they're nurses doesn't mean they're innocent. Bang bang.
1767000	1769000	Actually, I think he did kill them in the game.
1770000	1774000	Like, Joel just single-handedly whipped up the fireflies. He killed all of them. There were no more left.
1776000	1778000	Pen to the doctor because he's the hero.
1779000	1780000	Nope. Ask the doctors.
1780000	1788000	Well, I think they panned to the doctor because the doctor was a friend of Abby in the second game, which is, like, this event is why Abby goes after him for revenge.
1790000	1791000	It's Abby's father.
1792000	1795000	You're going to do something different with Abby. One of the nurses is going to be her or something.
1796000	1797000	Oh, okay.
1798000	1804000	I mean, you should have shot them too. There's no reason why they couldn't grab a gun and go after you, and you'd be pretty helpless carrying Ellie around.
1804000	1809000	Yeah, considering these people were willing to murder children, you can't really trust them.
1810000	1814000	So, that entire grand show down there lasted for about four minutes.
1815000	1816000	And it was super lame.
1820000	1821000	I don't know, I don't have it yet.
1826000	1828000	Can't keep herself from a boss fight.
1829000	1831000	I think she'd want to do what's right.
1832000	1833000	What's right?
1839000	1840000	I'm sure she's the hero now.
1844000	1845000	You've killed everyone.
1847000	1848000	The doctor's fucking gone.
1851000	1854000	No, you can't. Like, your brain surgeon is dead surgeon.
1855000	1856000	No.
1857000	1858000	Bang.
1861000	1862000	Bang.
1865000	1866000	What? No, shoot her.
1872000	1875000	This is going to be more to the game, because she doesn't know what happened.
1876000	1878000	The doctors, they couldn't make any of it work.
1882000	1886000	She puts down her gun so that she can be extra reasonable, and there comes the shot.
1887000	1888000	They've stopped looking for a cure.
1892000	1893000	Wow, he got his hand out real quick.
1894000	1897000	Okay, that was not how he was holding that gun, but okay.
1898000	1899000	No.
1900000	1904000	Because he would have held that hid underneath her robe and then fired it through the robe.
1907000	1909000	Oh, we've got to make her look even more villainous.
1910000	1911000	Yeah, because she's wounded.
1913000	1915000	Put my gun down, how could you do this?
1917000	1918000	Pedro, no care.
1921000	1923000	Pedro, put your gun down.
1925000	1926000	Sure.
1927000	1928000	He's justified.
1929000	1932000	Wow, they botched that whole sequence.
1933000	1934000	That was pretty bad.
1935000	1936000	So much was done wrong.
1937000	1940000	The look of it was correct, completely, but everything was done wrong.
1948000	1950000	Because now Ellie can learn the horrible secret.
1951000	1952000	Oh, Joel killed all those people.
1953000	1954000	Oh, there was totally a cure.
1955000	1956000	Oh, Joel, why are you Joel, bad person, Joel?
1957000	1966000	Yeah, I mean, the final shot of the game is Ellie asking Joel, did you actually kill everyone?
1967000	1968000	And Joel says no, and then the game ends.
1969000	1975000	I want to point out a slight plot hole here introduced by the whole retcon at the beginning.
1976000	1979000	Black Chick knows why Ellie's immune now.
1979000	1980000	We can manage that.
1981000	1984000	She knows that her mother was bitten while pregnant.
1985000	1993000	So all they would have to do is literally get pregnant women and infect them with the cordyceps and voila.
1994000	1995000	Yep.
1996000	1997000	They have the cure.
1998000	2001000	They could make as many babies as they wanted to with this.
2001000	2008000	Yeah, like if you wanted to be really brutal about it, you could just infect every single woman who gets pregnant.
2009000	2011000	And then you have a generation of people who are probably the right one.
2012000	2013000	They're pretty fucked up.
2014000	2018000	Like, OK, yeah, there would be some work to be done here, like on the timing, et cetera.
2019000	2020000	But this is absolutely something they could do.
2021000	2026000	Like they have the way to at the very least make more people that they can dissect for a proper cure.
2026000	2029000	So they have the means to do this.
2030000	2031000	They don't need Ellie.
2032000	2033000	And I'm not saying that you're not girly.
2034000	2035000	Yeah, that's true.
2036000	2037000	Absolutely.
2038000	2039000	They've had this.
2040000	2041000	How old is Ellie?
2042000	2043000	Fourteen.
2044000	2047000	They've had this knowledge for fourteen years.
2050000	2051000	Hold on a second.
2052000	2054000	They didn't know that she was immune, I guess, before she got bitten.
2054000	2055000	Yeah, I guess, yeah.
2056000	2057000	I think you would have made her laugh.
2058000	2060000	But still, they have this knowledge.
2061000	2064000	It's not like Blackjack forgot about how she was born.
2065000	2068000	They could have just been like, oh, Ellie is immune.
2069000	2071000	We could recreate this somewhere else in a different Firefly base.
2072000	2073000	Yeah, hold on, why is she immune?
2074000	2078000	Oh, that's right, her mother said that she totally cut the cord before she was bit.
2079000	2080000	Come.
2081000	2083000	Dot's not connecting your beep, beep, beep.
2084000	2085000	She just forgot, I guess.
2086000	2087000	That's okay.
2088000	2089000	They just sort of forgot about that whole armada.
2090000	2091000	Yeah, it wasn't a very traumatizing event or anything.
2092000	2093000	Killing her best friend for life.
2094000	2096000	Promising to take care of her daughter.
2097000	2098000	Oh, this is the...
2099000	2100000	When I got bit in the mall, I wasn't on my own.
2101000	2103000	It was actually my lesbian friend.
2104000	2105000	Here we go.
2106000	2108000	Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies is true.
2114000	2115000	I swear.
2130000	2131000	Okay.
2134000	2135000	And end.
2138000	2139000	Oh, God.
2140000	2142000	Well, that was a waste of my fucking time.
2144000	2149000	I mean, so they had the sets, again, looking just like the game.
2150000	2152000	The very well-known moments and lines.
2153000	2154000	The shots were blocked the same way.
2155000	2156000	The lines were the same. They were delivered the same.
2157000	2159000	Even though it's by different actors, they delivered the lines the same way.
2160000	2166000	But they messed up so much of the underpinning of the story that it just completely fell apart.
2167000	2169000	It just lost all meaning.
2170000	2171000	It just means nothing.
2171000	2177000	All the sacrifice, all the things that Joel did have been devalued or changed to fit the sequel.
2178000	2180000	So that they can continue to milk this setting.
2181000	2183000	Even though it was just like a one-shot story to begin with.
2184000	2185000	Because everything has to be a franchise.
2186000	2187000	We've got to keep milking it.
2188000	2189000	Can't just leave it be.
2190000	2199000	The original purpose of the game basically was, as you play through, you notice that Joel does more and more violent and...
2200000	2205000	violent, immoral things in the service of keeping Ellie safe.
2206000	2212000	And then by the end, he's completely willing to just kill all of the Fireflies and completely destroy their movement.
2213000	2219000	Even though the game makes it clear that it's not 100%, but there's a decent chance that this might work.
2220000	2222000	And that Ellie... The show didn't make this clear.
2223000	2225000	The game makes it clear that Ellie wants to do it, even if it kills her.
2225000	2230000	The game makes it very clear that she's willing to die, but Joel's not willing to let her go.
2231000	2236000	So Joel kills them all, he lies to her about it, and that sets up the conflict of the second game.
2237000	2238000	At least part of the conflict of the second game between Joel and Ellie.
2239000	2248000	But the point is to watch Joel not go crazy, but turn evil as he tries to defend this girl.
2249000	2251000	And they've undermined that entire plot.
2252000	2254000	They've undermined it consistently throughout the whole season.
2255000	2258000	I don't know. I just... This show... Bad.
2259000	2263000	Yeah, it went from... Before we were saying, this is a mediocre show.
2264000	2265000	Yeah, in the beginning it was like, half-decent.
2266000	2269000	And then like, this ending was just like, oh man.
2270000	2275000	Before we started this recording today, we talked about bad shows and how they just leave an awful taste in your mouth.
2276000	2281000	This show has reached that point too, where it's like, yeah, it just feels like Halo, feels like the rest of them.
2281000	2285000	Feels just like a complete disservice to the entire setting and story.
2286000	2291000	Yeah, if you knew what The Last of Us Part 1 was supposed to be about, the first game,
2292000	2297000	once you get to this point, once you get to the finale of this season, it's all come apart.
2298000	2300000	And it is just as bad as those bad shows, because they ruined everything in the end.
2301000	2304000	I guess it wasn't actually the good show after all, Arch.
2305000	2306000	We were deceived, Arch did it.
2306000	2311000	For me, this was never particularly interesting. It's a zombie show without the zombies. I'm like, okay.
2312000	2317000	I wanted to see the zombies. I don't care about these stupid humans and their fucking lives, frankly.
2318000	2321000	And the two humans I did care about barely got any fucking screen time.
2322000	2326000	And in the end, when they're supposed to be the grand finale for the two humans I did kind of care about,
2326000	2335000	they spent, let me check here, they spent 13 minutes of the 43 minute episode waffling about
2336000	2342000	until Joel goes all fucking postal for less than four minutes, two minutes action sequence.
2343000	2348000	And then that's it. The thing is done. It's over. We're on to second season now.
2349000	2354000	And I hated the Fireflies too, because that scene, I was sitting there and I was debating,
2354000	2358000	should I say it? Should I be like, oh, she puts down the gun and he shoots her?
2359000	2361000	But I'm like, nah, nah, that would be too fucking stupid.
2362000	2365000	That would be too goddamn cringe and dumb. And there we are.
2366000	2369000	Because suddenly the Fireflies are the good guys and they're not the good guys.
2370000	2373000	Listen to what they're saying. They have no idea if this will work.
2374000	2379000	They have a wild theory that the mushroom in her head is totally protecting her from the other mushrooms,
2380000	2382000	even though the other mushrooms attack her on sight.
2382000	2385000	They have no evidence of this. They haven't drawn her blood.
2386000	2389000	They haven't tested her biology. They haven't done lab tests on this or anything.
2390000	2395000	They're like, well, her mushroom in her head, like make chemicals that scares the other mushrooms.
2396000	2400000	So we're just going to pop her open like a pumpkin and see what happens.
2401000	2402000	And if she dies, well, she dies.
2403000	2408000	That is not a good thing to do. And then she's like, we could save them all, Joel.
2408000	2412000	But her dad like, no, Joel is in the writing because Joel has something to protect.
2413000	2418000	They have a ludicrous fucking theory. They have no basis for believing any of this shit.
2419000	2422000	Yep. They've just been chopping up kids with little to no results.
2423000	2428000	And again, because they added in that retcon, we now know that they know why she's immune.
2429000	2431000	Yep. Yep. So they had no reason to have her.
2431000	2442000	It was far more complicated to get her to do that than to literally capture some women, forcibly impregnate them, then infect them, and then kill them, and then basically take the babies at the right time.
2443000	2452000	Their whole organization, they put two and two together here and be like, okay, Ellie, so we've got a goddamn hospital here. We've got electricity.
2453000	2458000	We can run some tests on you. You can analyze your blood. Probably maybe even do like head scans or something. I don't know how much shit they have.
2458000	2465000	But she should be the baseline test patient so that they can recreate whatever is happening in her.
2466000	2471000	Busting her head open first over, well, we do kind of think her mushroom special.
2472000	2477000	Yeah. Yeah. That's also not how any of this shit works ever.
2478000	2484000	Like just chopping somebody up instantly on the board is like, okay, you take the one person you have that is immune to this thing. You just killed them.
2484000	2490000	And you figured out nothing. And you've done that before. You admitted that you've done that before and it failed before.
2491000	2499000	And then you've not only done it once, but you've done it multiple times. Here's the rare opportunity presented yet again with like the eight other times with another person who so happens to be immune.
2500000	2507000	Maybe we should try a different tactic. No, put on a table, chop them up. Oh, good. They died again. Like nothing happened.
2508000	2518000	At least in the games, they had done this several times before. They'd built up a database. They had a reasonable indication that what they were doing were correct.
2519000	2525000	Because, you know, that's that's trial and error. You do it, you test a thing and it didn't work. Okay, try again. Like they had a basis here.
2526000	2534000	That entire thing is like, well, you know, probably we chop up children and like nothing happens, but we just keep doing it.
2537000	2547000	It's also bad. And again, the way they should. This is Hollywood 101, where they're beating you over the head, like sympathize to these people.
2548000	2552000	God damn you filthy viewer. You're stupid enough to be affected by a sad violin, right?
2552000	2560000	Look at Joel's executing the poor fat guy who just wanted to kill a child. I just want to kill a kid.
2561000	2565000	We've done it like several times before. I'm totally a good guy, too.
2566000	2571000	Marlene's like, yeah, we've killed children. You know, we're going to keep doing it until we find a cure. It's like, OK.
2572000	2581000	I don't really buy it. I don't really buy it. Like it's too forced. It's too it's too much like they're trying to get you to sympathize with these characters that are clearly wrong.
2582000	2586000	Every bit of shred of evidence they've suggested has already proven to me that it doesn't work.
2587000	2594000	If you've killed multiple people to try to figure out how this, you know, cure thing works or inoculation and it's failed every single time.
2595000	2603000	You can't convince me that just keep chopping up more people is going to magically a failure is going to turn from, you know, to a success.
2604000	2609000	It's like trying to change, you know, something that physically can't be changed. It's not the right it's not the right method.
2609000	2616000	So, Arch, are you going to I mean, The Last of Us is on Steam. You can play the you can play it now and see how good the actual game was.
2617000	2622000	Hold on. Yeah. Thank you for suggesting that I hurt myself. Very nice of you. Very friendly.
2623000	2628000	One thing is, Dev, is The Last of Us remake going to follow the retcons to try to facilitate, too?
2629000	2635000	Oh, it probably will. You know what? Because they had to like change a few things to make part two and they're going to like retcon once they do the remake of part one.
2636000	2641000	Yep. Because that's a remake. They're not actually just going to give you The Last of Us on PC.
2642000	2648000	They're going to give you The Last of Us part one, which means that the thing is when The Last of Us came out and I own the original Last of Us copy.
2649000	2652000	This doesn't say part one on it. No, it says The Last of Us.
2653000	2659000	It's a one time video game with a one time story. It's a one shot product. That's it.
2659000	2668000	It's not a trilogy. It's not anything. It's just a pretend little thing. And it's like, nope, they got to milk it. They got to make it Last of Us part two.
2669000	2675000	Well, here's the thing. Yeah, The Last of Us came out in the PS3 and then on the PS4 it came out, it got remastered.
2676000	2683000	So it was still the same game. And then you had, now it's being rereleased, remade as Last of Us part one to make it fit with the new lore.
2683000	2688000	You know what, they've ruined the whole thing. It's all fucking, you know what, here. I'm just going to message Lilith real quick.
2689000	2706000	Hey, Lilith, you're actually in luck that you couldn't make it tonight. This was awful. Lucky her. Lucky her.
2706000	2713000	Yeah. I think, for each reference Dev, I think I've been called into work, even though I'm not employed anywhere.
2714000	2716000	But, you know, I must go.
2721000	2724000	Hey, I came back in real quick. I just thought of something.
2725000	2730000	Yeah, nothing. This whole fucking recording doesn't matter. I'm going to lock Dev out of here. Damn!
2731000	2732000	I just thought of something big. All right?
2733000	2734000	Okay, better be fucking big.
2734000	2736000	Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I had to share this.
2737000	2738000	All right, fair enough.
2739000	2750000	The whole Ellie's mother was bit while pregnant thing. It doesn't just ruin this episode. It doesn't just ruin Marlene's motivation. It ruins the entire trip.
2751000	2752000	Because think about it, like Marlene...
2753000	2755000	Oh my God, Dev, come here. I'm going to strangle you. We've already established this.
2755000	2761000	Think back to the first episode though, okay? Marlene's bleeding out of her side and she's like, this is our only hope, dude.
2762000	2769000	Joel, I don't trust you, but you gotta, you gotta take Ellie. What do you mean? What do you mean? The whole show is meaningless.
2770000	2771000	Yes. Correct.
2772000	2773000	Oh my God.
2774000	2775000	I thought we were already on the same page.
2776000	2779000	I was talking with Naomi about it and I realized, oh my God, this is more than just this episode. It's everything.
2780000	2781000	Yeah.
2782000	2783000	The whole show has been ruined.
2783000	2786000	All I think I've just realized is Dev never listens to me when I talk.
2787000	2788000	I'm sorry.
2789000	2791000	I think that's because I told you that and you agreed with me.
2794000	2796000	All right. I'm sorry guys. Have fun, okay?
2797000	2799000	Okay. I'll fucking never forgive. I'll never forgive this.
