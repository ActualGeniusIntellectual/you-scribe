00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Welcome to the final episode everyone. No Lilith today, unfortunately. She got called in to work. She's not here. I kind of envy her. She doesn't have to watch The Last of Us.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
What does she really call in to work? Like, we have to ask ourselves.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
It's not Rings of Power.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Yeah, it's not that bad. As you said last time, Arch, this was The Good Show.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Yes, this is as good as modern entertainment is likely to get.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
You see how he's trying to twist you, Arch. He's trying to say, oh, it's The Good Show. But he's leaving out the context.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Compared to Velma or She-Hulk.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Lilith still appears on my channel in the TUBcast and we'll get her in for something else down the road, I'm sure.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
She's spared the finale. And, okay, it's really strange that the finale is episode 9.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
You know what I mean? I've seen seasons be 8 episodes, 10 episodes, 12 episodes, not 9 episodes.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, it's kind of a weird spot to end it.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Considering this feels like it needs more.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Like, 12 episodes would help.

01:12.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, if this show had 3 more episodes, they could have done their 2 flashback bits just fine and filled out the rest of the actual content of the show and everyone would have been happy.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
But this show feels like it wasted too much time and now it's rushing to the end.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
That's true.

01:34.000 --> 01:48.000
Also, Arch, I was reading the comments on your channel since, for those of you who only watch my channel, Arch and Kibz go do a podcast about this after we do the React video.

01:48.000 --> 02:00.000
I was reading comments on your channel, Arch, and some people were saying that all the big YouTube channels that cover this sort of thing, like Nerdronic and guys like that, they all gave this show up 2 or 3 episodes in.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm made of sterner stuff than soft, genteel persons like this.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
That's true. We've endured lots of really bad shows.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
Joking aside, this isn't that bad. It's bland. Sure, it's mediocre. Yeah, it's not that interesting.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
But this ain't no Obi-Wan Kenobi. This doesn't hurt. There's no Wellma where I watch the episodes and I'm in pain.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
It's just a long series of insults.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
It hurts. It physically hurts to be there. It's like, oh, I think I want to die.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, those other channels that they did watch all of Kenobi and they did they did watch Velma, they did watch whatever it was. Right.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
But also a lot of them skipped Andor. Andor too was just very mediocre. Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
So I think I think they're there. Those guys are just focusing on the the really bad shows because they know like so.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
But it's not necessarily so bad. It's good. It's more like so bad. It's content. Meanwhile, The Last of Us isn't so bad as content.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
It's just it's just kind of there, you know, doing it primarily for the clicks.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
And I mean, we're all doing it for the clicks. But once you've started a series.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah, you got to finish. You got to finish. I actually completely agree with you on that.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
If I if I wasn't like that, I probably would have given this one up, too, because it's not it's just not that interesting.

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
It's not it's not even like it's not bad on a technical level. It's it's it's woke, but it's not ridiculously so.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
It's not it hasn't spun off into absurdity yet. It's just kind of there, you know.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Just meh. We're going to start it right now. Let's go for the finale.

03:42.000 --> 03:51.000
This is new, I think. TV show. You are not going to take another fucking deviation right now.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Surely. Yeah, this doesn't look familiar at all.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
You don't remember a pregnant woman running through a forest. Nope.

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
It's like here's another filler episode. You know, it seems like a bad idea to get pregnant in the apocalypse.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
It does. Yeah. You might want to keep it down.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
I know that's going to be a goddamn impossible. Yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
You know, childbirth, it's a three on the pain scale, not like stubbing your toe or anything.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Oh, for God's sake. That's Ellie's night.

04:33.000 --> 04:42.000
Now, is this Ellie's mother or something? Is the reason why she's immune because the zombie bit mommy just as she was being popped out?

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
If so, this is completely new and this is made up bullshit.

04:46.000 --> 05:00.000
Yep. Because the implication was it was just like a random genetic defect or not defect, you know, mutation that made her immune.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh, that just kind of sort of happened, I guess. She got lucky. I didn't even notice.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
That was quick and easy. Wow. Childbirth really is a two out of 10 on the pain scale.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh, and she has been. Oh, God, no, please don't tell me this is some gay record.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
Yep, it is because now that will be fed into the baby via the little umbilical cord.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Oh, my God. And she used the same knife that she just stabbed the clicker with or whatever.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
That's a brain dead move. Oh, to be fair, what else did you have? She was going to chew it off.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
I mean, let's wipe it off on the fabric, you know, maybe. Well, maybe.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
So you now have like a day or two to find someone to take this baby, because if you don't get that baby somewhere else.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
You're going to eat it. Also, how on God is good greed? This is the one of them.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
OK, let's hear it for a second. Oh, no, that is a retcon.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
It's a retcon. Wow.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Pause there for a second. I just want to. OK, hold on.

06:06.000 --> 06:17.000
All right. What's up, Arch? I just wanted to see if that zombie was even ever near her thighs to bite her.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
Yep, because this is something this show does constantly. Like people are suddenly they look down and they're like,

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, my God, I'm wounded. When the zombie was never even close to it. There's never a scene where it's like,

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
yeah, because they do the jump cuts and it's like, look, we cut so much. Oh, I can't believe it got so fast.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
It's like, yeah, you're so you're so bad at visual storytelling, you don't even show it.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, it kind of bent off in the general direction of her thigh for a second.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Not anywhere close enough to bite her on the thigh, but at least they kind of pretended.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
They put the vague effort forward. Yes, there was an effort made better than the previous one.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
All right. That was five minutes of the crucial super densely packed last episode wasted on a retcon origin story.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
Great. Good. That does nothing to the actual story whatsoever, because this information is literally not important.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Good job. Utterly irrelevant. Let's go.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Just to retcon a few things here. It's like you've already convinced me that she has these powers.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
I frankly don't care or need to know where she got them from. Well, it doesn't matter.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
It's not the point of the story. It's a waste of time. I just hate it.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.000
The show uses time so poorly. I guess they're just relying on the fact that we've got two seasons, I guess.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
Yep. Oh, that's right. They're going to just drag it out. Well, the second season is the second game, though.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
What? Really? They've already confirmed that. Yeah. That's horrific.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah. They've already confirmed. I do not want to watch the second season, Dev. They've already confirmed the second season is the second game.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
And I looked it up in terms of the game's storyline.

08:00.000 --> 08:11.000
After the cannibal cultists, they have the final confrontation with the fireflies and then they go back to Tommy's commune for the finale.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
So we're at the end of the game already. Yeah, I know we're I know this is like the end.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
But it was like I was like wondering, like, OK, they got on the season, but they I thought they said they weren't going to do that because, you know, nobody would like that.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Then I forget that Neil Druckmann is the executive producer.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
Yes. Oh, it all makes sense because he hates women. And the girl who wrote this, he hates his guts.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
So he needs to completely destroy everything she made. I keep forgetting that. Listen, I keep forgetting that.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Cibs, you can't make Neil Druckmann sound that based.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
Neil Druckmann hates women. I don't know if I'm willing to give him that W, Kyle.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Sorry, but like the reason why he's doing what he's doing is because he hates the writer of the show so much or the game.

08:53.000 --> 09:02.000
Oh, God, no. So this is going to be them who is going to find the baby and they're going to kill the mother just this before she bites her thigh.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
This is so stupid. This retcon is so dumb. It makes no sense.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
That's the Firefly leader, right? This never happens. This is all new.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
This is made up bullshit. Help me.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
Like this, this is not necessarily a TV show.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
It's the unnecessary desire to tether everything together.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
Star Wars had this problem, too, where it's like every every little side character in the background of every stupid shot is like some important thing.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
So everything has to be connected because that's just shitty writing.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
So is the story going to be that that the Firefly guys took Ellie and gave her to Fedra and then took her back?

09:42.000 --> 09:51.000
But only randomly because she she ran away with her girlfriend that one night.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Oh, but her mother was a Firefly, I guess. I guess this is all new.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
That's why they took her in. And that's why they put her to give her to Fedra of all people.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
She needs to be fed.

10:06.000 --> 10:14.000
And I'm basically a mushroom. Yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
I got it before I was bit.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Before. You liar.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
I don't want you to give her this.

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
Don't just put it. The baby is going to actually hit the spring and just knife itself.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
All you know, it's just a very valuable is that we've known each other.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Do they get is that the original voice actors right there?

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh, yeah, Kelly.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
This wreck on stupid crap right now.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, it sounds like Ellie.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
OK, I appreciate the idea of wanting to get the characters in as a little bit of a tribute to patrol homage thing.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
But the reckoning is pointless. Why don't you just make the prize the original rules?

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, she's obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, this was originally going to be a movie.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
I looked up on the Internet. This is going to be a movie based better.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
Please, please, please.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
This is going to be a movie.

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
And the reason that it's the project switched was because a bunch of the actresses they wanted for Ellie all age out of the role,

11:45.000 --> 12:00.000
they were trying to make it. Cover her ears.

12:00.000 --> 12:08.000
She's a baby.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
Now, look, the fireflies are based in good now.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Ten minutes of wasted time with the climax.

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
So you know, Druckmann can justify his retcons.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
That was stupid and a waste of our time. This is the last time you guys will see that forehead.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
I'll think, fuck, it's so big. Yeah, her performance grew on me.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
But her forehead didn't. No, it grew on it.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Where else would you hear me?

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
No, what I found this in there.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
B for Roni, Chef Boyardee.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
That transition looked like what was going on was she was thinking back to the time she was one day old.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Have you ever played this? Getting close.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
And again, we've completely skipped the nursing him back to health thing.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
That never happened. It's just, God, that was supposed to be a bonding event.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It's spring now.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
It would have been a good character growing moment for Ellie, too.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
It would show all the things she'd learned from Joel.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
But no, she'd stabbed him in the stomach twice with them penicillin, and then he killed the town.

13:30.000 --> 13:38.000
Wait, even after they bonded, Joel wasn't like this chummy with her.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
It's almost like he's sucking up to her.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
That'd be great. He's thanking her for saving his bacon, I guess.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
I'm sure Neil Druckmann had some words to say.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
It's tainted. It's basically a pedo show now. I'm sad.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
They both seem off now.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Their character interactions feel wrong.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Come on, I'll give you a boost.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
I'm sorry, Joel. I'm distracted by memories of my mother, who I totally remember.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
That's what this flashback is about. I'm going to talk about my mom.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah, fine.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Just you kind of seem extra quiet today, so...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
Extra quiet? Oh, yes, because she's usually so very demure.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah, she's very chatty, actually.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Show.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I guess the show forgot her character for a bit there.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
I think they forgot a lot of things the more they get into this.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Whoa.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Damn it, Ellie!

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
Okay, I guess she got retarded, too.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm glad you see this!

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Ellie!

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Up here!

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Ellie!

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Come on!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Jesus.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
What is wrong with the writing? Holy shit.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Ellie!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
This is a post-apocalyptic situation.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
You're running through a building you've never been in, all excited around corners and rooms you've never seen before.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
Just out of curiosity, this isn't reminiscent of the game, is it?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
No.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah, I have a sneaking suspicion this is them running out of game and trying to right-throw themselves.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
No, I think this scene was unique, though, wasn't it?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Yes, the zoo animals. Okay.

15:43.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, they skipped the actual entry into the city. They made that all different, but then there's the zoo animals part.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I will.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah, I do remember this thing. The giraffe. I don't know why I said thing.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
What are you doing?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It's all right.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Come here, hurry up. Come on.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
The writer wanted to reference Jurassic Park, okay? The brachiosaur scene.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Na na na na na.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Na na na. Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
John Williams makes good music.

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
Now, the way into the city was through, like, a flooded bypass tunnel that had a bunch of clickers in it.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But they just skipped all the exits.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, it's video gaming.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
That might be fun to watch.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Wouldn't want that.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
We need to see a birthing scene that didn't matter.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
All right, almost 20 minutes of this final super important episode finale.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
The only things that have happened is a retcon and a giraffe being fed.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
Also, Kibs, listen, I've seen your thumbnails on your channel. I know that pregnancy is your fetish, buddy.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
That's true.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
That's false. That was a meme.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
That wasn't a meme. I know the person. He liked it.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
What?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
He requested it. I know the guy who drew it.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
So?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Is it everything you hoped for?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
What?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah, I requested it because it's a meme.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
See? Your narrative falls apart. That's all it is.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Don't worry, Kyle. I don't judge you for having a preggo fetish.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
The fuck?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Look, I don't know exactly where this hospital is.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah, we'll find it.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Sure. It's just...

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Maybe there's nothing bad out there, but so far there's always been something bad out there.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
We're still here, though.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
I know.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
But remarkably few zombies.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
It can't be for nothing.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
It will be, though. That's the plot twist.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
This is what we in the biz refer to as the establishing death flag scene.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
After we're done, we'll totally go and do cool things.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
You'll not have a golf club hit your head, Joel. What?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
What golf club? Nothing.

18:16.000 --> 18:26.000
So, there's a YouTube channel called Fee that did a short little video describing why Tommy's city, Jacksonville I think it was, was not actually communism.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
And it's more like how the Amish lived.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah. It was a good video.

18:32.000 --> 18:41.000
It was a good video, yeah. But basically, it lacks the coercive elements because everyone voluntarily comes together.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
And people can leave whenever they want.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
But that's what true communism is.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
That's true. That isn't communism.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
So the show lied. The show's been trying to make things into communism.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
That is the communist's view of communism.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Except they don't let you leave and they kill your entire family.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Well, what's funny though is that in the game they didn't call it communism.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
It was just a collectively owned city because you had to because it was the apocalypse.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Because they needed to survive.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
But this is the current year and there's politics to be had.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah, narratives to be said.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Wow, it's Chaz.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Oh my god, I forgot what that was.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
That's a blast from the past.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yep.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
I think that's new too.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
They keep making stuff up, don't they?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I wasn't scared either. I was ready.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah, this is all new.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
So I decided to put a gun to the side of my head and shoot upwards.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Okay. Joe, you're a tard.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
I think they're breaking his character in front of us.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah, they're undermining him because he needs to be weaker.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I still don't know why.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
They've broken him in body because of his panic attack, now they break him in spirit because he gave up.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I don't know why you're telling me all this.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yep.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I reckon you do.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I don't think Sarah was brought up again between these two after that one scene.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That's why that one scene in the bedroom was so important.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Yep, because this devalues it too.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
The Last of Us confirms Joel's attempt at suicide, so it was not mentioned explicitly in the game as far as I can see.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Also, I don't care if you flinch, if you've got a gun to your head, you can flinch as much as you want.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That 800 meters per second bullet ain't gonna fucking care, bruh.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I flinched a little, but the bullet caught up.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
In fact, the flinching was because of the bullet.

21:11.000 --> 21:22.000
So, I know we were talking through it, but he just said that Ellie is basically the replacement Sarah, and obviously Ellie is the replacement Sarah, but he never said it in the game.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Shitty puns.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Is this something you don't say?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
They expect you to think for yourself.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
No, the game had a better writer.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Uh-huh.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
That's topical.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
That's one. Moon rocks taste better than Earth rocks. Why?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Because they're meteor...

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Oh, that's terrible. That's a...

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
That's a zero out of ten.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
These are pretty good, by the way.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, but that other scene was, like, peeing on me.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Some man.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
That was a three out of ten.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Uh-oh.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Yep, I know. I've been watching them do that.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Help me!

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Wow. That was the dumbest way this could have happened.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
Remember, he needs to fail. He cannot be successful or competent. He cannot be the one who brings her there in the end.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Well, if this next part is like the game, he's about to be extremely competent.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
We'll see about that.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
But according to the retcon, he murdered some innocent people.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
You got here pretty hard.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Oh, there she is.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Five men. His only job was to protect him. He has still almost got killed.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
How'd she do it?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
It was all her.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
She felt like hell to get here.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
She's being prepped for surgery.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
But you said she wasn't hurt.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Our doctor...

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
He thinks that the cordyceps anelli has grown with her since birth.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Why is she in surgery?

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
It produces a kind of chemical messenger. It makes normal cordyceps think that she's cordyceps. It's why she's immune.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
He's going to remove it from her, multiply the cells in the lab...

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
That's stupid.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Because if that was the case, the zombies wouldn't attack her either.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yep.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
He thinks it could be a cure, Joel.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
This is bullshit.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Well, it sounds like an inoculation, not a cure, but still.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Cordyceps grows inside the brain.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
It does.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And if you kill the only person that has this...

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
There is no one else.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
We didn't tell her. We can cause her any fear. There won't be any pain.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
No, you take me to her. You take me to her right now!

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
It's for the greater good, Joel.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
You don't understand.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I do.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I was there when she was born, Joel.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
No, you fucking weren't. God damn it.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
I was the black woman hero. You weren't, Joel.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
They're trying to make her seem not monstrous when she was pretty monstrous in the end.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Yep, because she's black and they have to do that to make him look bad because he's a white man.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I know.

24:24.000 --> 24:34.000
In the original story, you could find a log where they had done this on several other immune people before, and it didn't work, and they were just grasping at straws.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
It fails every time, because it doesn't do anything.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Yeah, but Marlene was basically just like, no, it's going to work this time. We have to do it again.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
Yep, that's why the last was part two, basically. They tried to paint it the other way, like, no, no, it would have worked. This time it's different.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
He tries anything.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Last time wasn't really communism, guys.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Also, he's not even getting paid.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
No, she's going to hit the desk.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Isn't that another retcon? Because I thought he got two options in the game.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
To get paid or to leave.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Oh, she's crying because she's the real victim.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Marlene is a villain, by the way.

25:19.000 --> 25:31.000
I think in the game, basically, they had killed the others, and they didn't get enough data to recreate it, but they were almost there, and they just needed Ellie's brain to finally finish the vaccine.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Well, that's what they claimed. They probably said that about the last children they killed, too.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
Thirty minutes. We are almost out of time in this episode, and nothing has happened.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Oh, wow, Jesus.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
They've wasted so much time.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
They're going to have to rush through this fucking rescue awfully quick, or just end it on a...

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
Ugh, not just stop it on a cliffhanger. That would be the worst thing.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
You know, I'm pretty sure she heard those gunshots.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Yep.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Help her!

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Joel's a monster.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Ammo.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
They were innocent people, what do you see?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
They just wanted to kill children for fun.

26:23.000 --> 26:34.000
Well, the way it was set up in the game is basically like, at this point, Joel's destroyed multiple cities in defense of Ellie, and now he's going to destroy the cure in defense of Ellie.

26:35.000 --> 26:43.000
Also, I want to point out, he grabbed a magazine from what appeared to be an AR-15 or M-16. I bet you he's going to reload that M-14 with that.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Yep, they're going out of their way to make him look super fucked up and evil.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Well, that's actually pretty close to the... Yeah, there it is, Archie.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Yep, yep, he's... beautiful.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
God dammit.

26:57.000 --> 27:10.000
So, that's actually kind of the point of the game, though, Kip, is that by the end of the game, Joel was just doing blatantly immoral things in defense of Ellie. So that tracks.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
He'll kill them.

27:19.000 --> 27:27.000
Oh great, another M-16 AR-15 to reload my M-14 with, yeah. They both start with M, don't they?

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
This is... they've somehow managed to make the sequence super lame with the music.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It's like...

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
He's so evil, guys.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
The thing is, right now they're just telling...

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Right now they're just telling...

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
It's like, this should not be a sad violin music. This should be a fucking rock moment.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
He is killing the bad people. These are not the heroes of this story.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, we've already established that the fireflies aren't good.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
The show fucks up its final act, wonderful.

28:06.000 --> 28:14.000
Run out of M-14 mags from the M-16 after he was a pistol in the boss fight.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
It's hitting all the beats of this sequence in the game, but it's messed with the story too much to make it feel the same.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Because the point was that, like, you might actually be convinced that the fireflies have a shot.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
Marlene's pretty delusional, and she's not a great person, but they're trying, you know?

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
They tried too hard to make Marlene likeable in this, to make this work.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Because it had to be like an evil versus evil scenario.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Not to mention, they haven't even talked anything about a cure now, or they're closed or anything.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
They've just said, oh, we're going to cut up in our head because, you know, we figure this might work.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Like, we have a theory that the cordycept might be living in her head.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
We've got a theory that it might cause her to be immune. Okay.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I won't let you take her.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Yep, that was a pretty bad move, doc.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Cover her arm. Fast.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Turn around.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
Now remember, just because they're nurses doesn't mean they're innocent. Bang bang.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Actually, I think he did kill them in the game.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
Like, Joel just single-handedly whipped up the fireflies. He killed all of them. There were no more left.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Pen to the doctor because he's the hero.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Nope. Ask the doctors.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
Well, I think they panned to the doctor because the doctor was a friend of Abby in the second game, which is, like, this event is why Abby goes after him for revenge.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
It's Abby's father.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
You're going to do something different with Abby. One of the nurses is going to be her or something.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Oh, okay.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
I mean, you should have shot them too. There's no reason why they couldn't grab a gun and go after you, and you'd be pretty helpless carrying Ellie around.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
Yeah, considering these people were willing to murder children, you can't really trust them.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
So, that entire grand show down there lasted for about four minutes.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
And it was super lame.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
I don't know, I don't have it yet.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Can't keep herself from a boss fight.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I think she'd want to do what's right.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
What's right?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm sure she's the hero now.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
You've killed everyone.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
The doctor's fucking gone.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
No, you can't. Like, your brain surgeon is dead surgeon.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
No.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Bang.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Bang.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
What? No, shoot her.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
This is going to be more to the game, because she doesn't know what happened.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
The doctors, they couldn't make any of it work.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
She puts down her gun so that she can be extra reasonable, and there comes the shot.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
They've stopped looking for a cure.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Wow, he got his hand out real quick.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Okay, that was not how he was holding that gun, but okay.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
No.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
Because he would have held that hid underneath her robe and then fired it through the robe.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Oh, we've got to make her look even more villainous.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, because she's wounded.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Put my gun down, how could you do this?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Pedro, no care.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Pedro, put your gun down.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Sure.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
He's justified.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Wow, they botched that whole sequence.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
That was pretty bad.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
So much was done wrong.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
The look of it was correct, completely, but everything was done wrong.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Because now Ellie can learn the horrible secret.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Oh, Joel killed all those people.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Oh, there was totally a cure.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Oh, Joel, why are you Joel, bad person, Joel?

32:37.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah, I mean, the final shot of the game is Ellie asking Joel, did you actually kill everyone?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
And Joel says no, and then the game ends.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
I want to point out a slight plot hole here introduced by the whole retcon at the beginning.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Black Chick knows why Ellie's immune now.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
We can manage that.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
She knows that her mother was bitten while pregnant.

33:05.000 --> 33:13.000
So all they would have to do is literally get pregnant women and infect them with the cordyceps and voila.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Yep.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
They have the cure.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
They could make as many babies as they wanted to with this.

33:21.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah, like if you wanted to be really brutal about it, you could just infect every single woman who gets pregnant.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
And then you have a generation of people who are probably the right one.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
They're pretty fucked up.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Like, OK, yeah, there would be some work to be done here, like on the timing, et cetera.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
But this is absolutely something they could do.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Like they have the way to at the very least make more people that they can dissect for a proper cure.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
So they have the means to do this.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
They don't need Ellie.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
And I'm not saying that you're not girly.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Yeah, that's true.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Absolutely.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
They've had this.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
How old is Ellie?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Fourteen.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
They've had this knowledge for fourteen years.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Hold on a second.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
They didn't know that she was immune, I guess, before she got bitten.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
I think you would have made her laugh.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
But still, they have this knowledge.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
It's not like Blackjack forgot about how she was born.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
They could have just been like, oh, Ellie is immune.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
We could recreate this somewhere else in a different Firefly base.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Yeah, hold on, why is she immune?

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
Oh, that's right, her mother said that she totally cut the cord before she was bit.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Come.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Dot's not connecting your beep, beep, beep.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
She just forgot, I guess.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
That's okay.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
They just sort of forgot about that whole armada.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Yeah, it wasn't a very traumatizing event or anything.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Killing her best friend for life.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Promising to take care of her daughter.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Oh, this is the...

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
When I got bit in the mall, I wasn't on my own.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
It was actually my lesbian friend.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Here we go.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies is true.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I swear.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Okay.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
And end.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Oh, God.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Well, that was a waste of my fucking time.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
I mean, so they had the sets, again, looking just like the game.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
The very well-known moments and lines.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
The shots were blocked the same way.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
The lines were the same. They were delivered the same.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Even though it's by different actors, they delivered the lines the same way.

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
But they messed up so much of the underpinning of the story that it just completely fell apart.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
It just lost all meaning.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
It just means nothing.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
All the sacrifice, all the things that Joel did have been devalued or changed to fit the sequel.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
So that they can continue to milk this setting.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Even though it was just like a one-shot story to begin with.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Because everything has to be a franchise.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
We've got to keep milking it.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Can't just leave it be.

36:30.000 --> 36:39.000
The original purpose of the game basically was, as you play through, you notice that Joel does more and more violent and...

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
violent, immoral things in the service of keeping Ellie safe.

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
And then by the end, he's completely willing to just kill all of the Fireflies and completely destroy their movement.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
Even though the game makes it clear that it's not 100%, but there's a decent chance that this might work.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
And that Ellie... The show didn't make this clear.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
The game makes it clear that Ellie wants to do it, even if it kills her.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
The game makes it very clear that she's willing to die, but Joel's not willing to let her go.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
So Joel kills them all, he lies to her about it, and that sets up the conflict of the second game.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
At least part of the conflict of the second game between Joel and Ellie.

37:19.000 --> 37:28.000
But the point is to watch Joel not go crazy, but turn evil as he tries to defend this girl.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And they've undermined that entire plot.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
They've undermined it consistently throughout the whole season.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I don't know. I just... This show... Bad.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Yeah, it went from... Before we were saying, this is a mediocre show.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Yeah, in the beginning it was like, half-decent.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
And then like, this ending was just like, oh man.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
Before we started this recording today, we talked about bad shows and how they just leave an awful taste in your mouth.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
This show has reached that point too, where it's like, yeah, it just feels like Halo, feels like the rest of them.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
Feels just like a complete disservice to the entire setting and story.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah, if you knew what The Last of Us Part 1 was supposed to be about, the first game,

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
once you get to this point, once you get to the finale of this season, it's all come apart.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
And it is just as bad as those bad shows, because they ruined everything in the end.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
I guess it wasn't actually the good show after all, Arch.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
We were deceived, Arch did it.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
For me, this was never particularly interesting. It's a zombie show without the zombies. I'm like, okay.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
I wanted to see the zombies. I don't care about these stupid humans and their fucking lives, frankly.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
And the two humans I did care about barely got any fucking screen time.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
And in the end, when they're supposed to be the grand finale for the two humans I did kind of care about,

38:46.000 --> 38:55.000
they spent, let me check here, they spent 13 minutes of the 43 minute episode waffling about

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
until Joel goes all fucking postal for less than four minutes, two minutes action sequence.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
And then that's it. The thing is done. It's over. We're on to second season now.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
And I hated the Fireflies too, because that scene, I was sitting there and I was debating,

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
should I say it? Should I be like, oh, she puts down the gun and he shoots her?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
But I'm like, nah, nah, that would be too fucking stupid.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
That would be too goddamn cringe and dumb. And there we are.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
Because suddenly the Fireflies are the good guys and they're not the good guys.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Listen to what they're saying. They have no idea if this will work.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
They have a wild theory that the mushroom in her head is totally protecting her from the other mushrooms,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
even though the other mushrooms attack her on sight.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
They have no evidence of this. They haven't drawn her blood.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
They haven't tested her biology. They haven't done lab tests on this or anything.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
They're like, well, her mushroom in her head, like make chemicals that scares the other mushrooms.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
So we're just going to pop her open like a pumpkin and see what happens.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
And if she dies, well, she dies.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
That is not a good thing to do. And then she's like, we could save them all, Joel.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
But her dad like, no, Joel is in the writing because Joel has something to protect.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
They have a ludicrous fucking theory. They have no basis for believing any of this shit.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Yep. They've just been chopping up kids with little to no results.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
And again, because they added in that retcon, we now know that they know why she's immune.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Yep. Yep. So they had no reason to have her.

40:31.000 --> 40:42.000
It was far more complicated to get her to do that than to literally capture some women, forcibly impregnate them, then infect them, and then kill them, and then basically take the babies at the right time.

40:43.000 --> 40:52.000
Their whole organization, they put two and two together here and be like, okay, Ellie, so we've got a goddamn hospital here. We've got electricity.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
We can run some tests on you. You can analyze your blood. Probably maybe even do like head scans or something. I don't know how much shit they have.

40:58.000 --> 41:05.000
But she should be the baseline test patient so that they can recreate whatever is happening in her.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
Busting her head open first over, well, we do kind of think her mushroom special.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah. Yeah. That's also not how any of this shit works ever.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
Like just chopping somebody up instantly on the board is like, okay, you take the one person you have that is immune to this thing. You just killed them.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
And you figured out nothing. And you've done that before. You admitted that you've done that before and it failed before.

41:31.000 --> 41:39.000
And then you've not only done it once, but you've done it multiple times. Here's the rare opportunity presented yet again with like the eight other times with another person who so happens to be immune.

41:40.000 --> 41:47.000
Maybe we should try a different tactic. No, put on a table, chop them up. Oh, good. They died again. Like nothing happened.

41:48.000 --> 41:58.000
At least in the games, they had done this several times before. They'd built up a database. They had a reasonable indication that what they were doing were correct.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
Because, you know, that's that's trial and error. You do it, you test a thing and it didn't work. Okay, try again. Like they had a basis here.

42:06.000 --> 42:14.000
That entire thing is like, well, you know, probably we chop up children and like nothing happens, but we just keep doing it.

42:17.000 --> 42:27.000
It's also bad. And again, the way they should. This is Hollywood 101, where they're beating you over the head, like sympathize to these people.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
God damn you filthy viewer. You're stupid enough to be affected by a sad violin, right?

42:32.000 --> 42:40.000
Look at Joel's executing the poor fat guy who just wanted to kill a child. I just want to kill a kid.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
We've done it like several times before. I'm totally a good guy, too.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
Marlene's like, yeah, we've killed children. You know, we're going to keep doing it until we find a cure. It's like, OK.

42:52.000 --> 43:01.000
I don't really buy it. I don't really buy it. Like it's too forced. It's too it's too much like they're trying to get you to sympathize with these characters that are clearly wrong.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Every bit of shred of evidence they've suggested has already proven to me that it doesn't work.

43:07.000 --> 43:14.000
If you've killed multiple people to try to figure out how this, you know, cure thing works or inoculation and it's failed every single time.

43:15.000 --> 43:23.000
You can't convince me that just keep chopping up more people is going to magically a failure is going to turn from, you know, to a success.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
It's like trying to change, you know, something that physically can't be changed. It's not the right it's not the right method.

43:29.000 --> 43:36.000
So, Arch, are you going to I mean, The Last of Us is on Steam. You can play the you can play it now and see how good the actual game was.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
Hold on. Yeah. Thank you for suggesting that I hurt myself. Very nice of you. Very friendly.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
One thing is, Dev, is The Last of Us remake going to follow the retcons to try to facilitate, too?

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
Oh, it probably will. You know what? Because they had to like change a few things to make part two and they're going to like retcon once they do the remake of part one.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
Yep. Because that's a remake. They're not actually just going to give you The Last of Us on PC.

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
They're going to give you The Last of Us part one, which means that the thing is when The Last of Us came out and I own the original Last of Us copy.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
This doesn't say part one on it. No, it says The Last of Us.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
It's a one time video game with a one time story. It's a one shot product. That's it.

44:19.000 --> 44:28.000
It's not a trilogy. It's not anything. It's just a pretend little thing. And it's like, nope, they got to milk it. They got to make it Last of Us part two.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
Well, here's the thing. Yeah, The Last of Us came out in the PS3 and then on the PS4 it came out, it got remastered.

44:36.000 --> 44:43.000
So it was still the same game. And then you had, now it's being rereleased, remade as Last of Us part one to make it fit with the new lore.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
You know what, they've ruined the whole thing. It's all fucking, you know what, here. I'm just going to message Lilith real quick.

44:49.000 --> 45:06.000
Hey, Lilith, you're actually in luck that you couldn't make it tonight. This was awful. Lucky her. Lucky her.

45:06.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah. I think, for each reference Dev, I think I've been called into work, even though I'm not employed anywhere.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
But, you know, I must go.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Hey, I came back in real quick. I just thought of something.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
Yeah, nothing. This whole fucking recording doesn't matter. I'm going to lock Dev out of here. Damn!

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
I just thought of something big. All right?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Okay, better be fucking big.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I had to share this.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
All right, fair enough.

45:39.000 --> 45:50.000
The whole Ellie's mother was bit while pregnant thing. It doesn't just ruin this episode. It doesn't just ruin Marlene's motivation. It ruins the entire trip.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Because think about it, like Marlene...

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Oh my God, Dev, come here. I'm going to strangle you. We've already established this.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
Think back to the first episode though, okay? Marlene's bleeding out of her side and she's like, this is our only hope, dude.

46:02.000 --> 46:09.000
Joel, I don't trust you, but you gotta, you gotta take Ellie. What do you mean? What do you mean? The whole show is meaningless.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Yes. Correct.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Oh my God.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
I thought we were already on the same page.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I was talking with Naomi about it and I realized, oh my God, this is more than just this episode. It's everything.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
The whole show has been ruined.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
All I think I've just realized is Dev never listens to me when I talk.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
I'm sorry.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I think that's because I told you that and you agreed with me.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
All right. I'm sorry guys. Have fun, okay?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Okay. I'll fucking never forgive. I'll never forgive this.
