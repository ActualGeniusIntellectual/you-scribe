0	6240	So, I realized I forgot a few important issues in making the original anti-social media video,
6240	18180	so I figured I'd just do a quick epilogue to bring a couple more things up.
18180	23580	Because I'm a 32 year old boomer, I don't actually use Instagram or really understand
23580	24580	its subculture.
24580	25980	Here's basically what I know about it.
25980	29420	It's a social media network where you post pictures and people can comment on them.
29420	30520	That's about it.
30520	34720	It differs from Facebook in that it's centered around pictures specifically, while Facebook
34720	39120	is more of a general grab bag at whatever life stuff its users want to share.
39120	44000	But since Instagram is based out of the same 300 square mile area of Southern California
44000	47500	that all the other social media networks are, it's safe to say that it wallows in the
47500	52260	same subculture, suffers the same ethical problems, and attempts to export the same
52260	54140	values out to the rest of the world.
54140	58840	The most blatant example of conservative censorship on Instagram that I can personally find is
58840	61700	documented in this article on the Daily Wire.
61700	66980	Instagram censors conservative columnists for saying planned parenthood kills more blacks
66980	68800	than the KKK.
68800	72760	Conservative columnist Ryan Baumberger, a black man who was adopted after being conceived
72760	77520	in rape, dared to speak the truth about Planned Parenthood and abortion in general.
77520	81060	It kills more black people than the KKK ever did.
81060	82800	For that, Instagram censored him.
82800	86900	Now this article is going to open up an entire can of worms that I'd rather really avoid.
86900	90480	I did a video on abortion already if you want to go back and watch that, but for the
90480	93340	here and now I can kind of see his point of view.
93340	97780	If you believe that abortion is murder and that fetuses are full human beings, then it
97780	101720	makes sense to believe that abortion clinics routinely carry out murder, certainly on a
101720	106440	scale greater than the KKK, especially since the KKK has always been on the fringes of
106440	107820	American politics.
107820	111860	This is not what I personally believe regarding abortion, but it's not like Baumberger came
111860	113980	to his conclusion irrationally.
113980	141940	And here's the meme in question.
141940	146880	Regardless of how you feel about abortion, should this image have been censored off Instagram?
146880	149140	The numbers it cites are accurate.
149140	151080	You may disagree with the framing of the data.
151080	154940	You may think that aborted fetuses don't count as murders, but that's a different discussion.
154940	156340	Those numbers are accurate.
156340	158840	And either way, should it have been censored?
158840	165380	If Instagram were considered to be a child-centered network, then maybe, but that's not the case.
165380	169260	Instagram already has a way to place what it calls sensitive content behind a blurry
169260	173540	filter so that if people want to see it, they have to opt in by tapping on the content
173540	174540	itself.
174540	179820	Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom stated in a blog post that while these posts don't violate
179820	184220	our guidelines, someone in the community has reported them and our review team has confirmed
184220	185220	that they're sensitive.
185220	186880	And that's honestly fine by me.
186880	187920	It's not censorship.
187920	189020	The posts are still visible.
189020	190800	You just have to click them to see them.
190800	195320	Let's check Instagram's guidelines to see if there's a line clearly drawn between sensitive
195320	198380	content and completely banned content.
198380	201940	There are only photos and videos that you've taken or have the right to share.
201940	202940	That seems fair.
202940	206540	Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.
206540	210780	The heading for this section sounds like it might be bad, but it's entirely based around
210780	211780	nudity.
211780	214500	The diversity mentioned seems to be diversity of age.
214500	216740	Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.
216740	222220	Again, it's not a helpful header because the content of the rule only mentions spam.
222220	223220	Follow the law.
223220	224220	Fine.
224220	225960	Respect other members of the Instagram community.
225960	230320	This is where the part on harassment and hate speech comes in, but Bomberger's meme didn't
230320	231680	feature any of that.
231680	235440	Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.
235440	240640	I can only assume that Instagram model subculture has created the unfortunate side effect of
240640	243120	anorexia promotion groups on the platform.
243120	246100	Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.
246100	247680	This pertains to violence.
247680	251440	Don't post violent images even if they're from a newsworthy event.
251440	255020	Bomberger's anti-abortion meme doesn't violate any of these rules.
255020	256220	So why was it removed?
256220	258960	Why wasn't it just placed behind a sensitive content wall?
258960	262020	Is it because the people at Instagram disagree with his political stance?
262020	266540	However, there is a silver lining when it comes to Instagram, and it involves SJWs shooting
266540	267900	themselves in the foot.
267900	271440	Remember in the last video when I said that the measures that the lefty CEOs of social
271440	276020	media companies implement often end up hurting the rank-and-file SJWs on their side?
276020	278560	Well, here's a great example of that from Vice.
278560	282740	Users accuse Instagram of censoring hashtags about sex work and women.
282740	288220	Instagram is reportedly hiding posts from some users under hashtags like women, strippers,
288220	293180	female strippers, and sex workers rights day, while hashtags like man and male strippers
293180	294380	remain uncensored.
294380	298460	Under the censored hashtags, the space where photos usually appear is replaced by text
298460	302880	that reads, top posts from this hashtag are currently hidden because the community has
302880	306380	reported some content that may not meet Instagram's community deadlines.
306380	307980	Oh really?
307980	309860	Not so happy about censorship now, are you?
309860	314100	I mean, you are all just perpetuating the male gaze or whatever other bullshit theoretical
314100	318300	framework you use to justify censorship, so this is exactly what you wanted to happen.
318300	321940	The truth is, the style of social justice that currently has its grip on the social
321940	325860	media companies, as well as other segments of the political and cultural left, is an
325860	328380	anti-sex prudish stripe.
328380	333020	They're puritan in nature, believing that excessive displays of female sexuality only
333020	336940	exist to serve the male gaze, and are ultimately oppressive in nature towards women.
336940	341660	They've got more in common with conservative Christians or Islamists than the sex-positive,
341660	346300	pro-sex worker, personal liberation feminists that have been affected by their policies.
346300	352060	The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act make websites
352060	356660	liable for what users say and do on their platforms, causing platforms to preemptively
356660	362060	shutter or censor forms or entire sites where sex trafficking could feasibly happen, including
362060	364020	the Craigslist personal page.
364020	367960	Even before the passing of these bills, sex workers overwhelmingly warned that they would
367960	369380	do more harm than good.
369380	374380	And now, sex workers are reporting the devastating effects, like being forced to return to dangerous
374380	375380	pimps.
375380	376940	You did it, social justice.
376940	381340	You drove those problematic women, oppressing other women with their bodies in their sex
381340	384900	work, back underground where they can no longer be seen.
384900	388740	Social Justice in Action I actually have little to no personal experience
388740	392100	with Instagram in comparison to the other tech companies, so there's not really much
392100	393100	more I can say.
393180	396700	I just haven't been keeping my thumb on the pulse of this one, unfortunately.
396700	401660	But I bet there's a lot more SJW BS out there, as far as Instagram is concerned.
409660	411260	Apple Apple was one of the companies that kicked
411260	415580	Alex Jones off its platform without due cause, the event that kicked this whole thing off.
415580	420180	Despite Facebook and Apple not always seeing eye-to-eye, it was Apple's move that motivated
420180	421600	Mark Zuckerberg to act.
421600	426120	As reported in the New York Times article, Facebook banned Infowars, now what?
426120	430560	Late Sunday, Apple, which has often tried to stake out moral high ground on contentious
430560	434060	debates, removed Infowars podcasts from iTunes.
434060	437820	After seeing the news, Mark Zuckerberg sent a note to his team confirming his own decision.
437820	441860	The strikes against Infowars and Mr. Jones would count individually, and the pages would
441860	442860	come down.
442860	445620	The announcement arrived at 3 AM Pacific Time.
445620	449000	But like I said, Facebook and Apple do not always see eye-to-eye.
449000	453280	While Facebook lost nearly everybody's personal information to Cambridge Analytica,
453280	456240	Apple is significantly more stringent with its privacy policies.
456240	461040	Apple's CEO Tim Cook even took a pot shot at Zuckerberg, stating on MSNBC that if it
461040	463520	were him, he wouldn't have let things get so bad.
468960	472000	Look at this guy's face, that's a shit-eating grain if you ever saw one.
472000	475960	Apple's stricter stance on privacy has even led them to clash with the US government.
475960	480180	An iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters was recovered by the FBI, and Apple
480180	484280	refused to assist the FBI in decrypting it, citing privacy concerns.
484280	488700	This actually kicked off a legal battle between the FBI and Apple, with the government requesting
488700	493960	Apple supply them with a back door to the phone, using a 1977 ruling on the All Writs
493960	495280	Act as a precedent.
495280	499720	The bit of law in question allowed the government to compel technical assistance from private
499720	502160	phone companies in accessing call records.
502200	505920	Apple's counterargument is that while a phone company may compile call records in
505920	510120	the normal course of its business, Apple did not regularly unlock people's phones as
510120	513960	a normal course of its business, and forcing Apple's software engineers to create new
513960	518920	code to do the job would be considered a violation of the First Amendment as compelled speech,
518920	524560	since programming code was ruled to be free speech in Bernstein vs. United States in 1996.
524560	530360	So we can all rest easy, knowing that even in the face of overwhelming government pressure,
530360	534520	Apple will not bend, and won't give up all of our private info.
534520	538480	Apple iCloud data in China now stored by state-owned company.
538480	543000	Apple officially moves its Chinese iCloud operations and encryption keys to China.
543000	547800	Oh, so when it's the American government asking for one person's data, fuck you we
547800	548800	take a stand.
548800	552200	But when it's the Chinese government asking for everyone's data?
552200	556480	Of course, they're trustworthy, give them the cloud data, give them the encryption keys,
556480	557480	give them everything.
557480	561000	So China's decided to purge 25,000 apps from the Apple Store?
561000	563560	It's okay, they didn't need their free speech, don't worry about it.
563560	567320	Of course, we all know why Apple bends over backward for the Chinese government.
567320	571160	Apple makes all their shit in China, marks it up, and sells it in the West.
571160	575840	Everybody knows that Apple stuff is overpriced garbage that appeals to rich city hipsters,
575840	580200	and that the regular Chinese working person suffers greatly to make it for those rich
580200	581520	city hipsters.
581520	585160	Labor and health violations rampant at Apple supplier in China.
585160	589480	An investigation by China Labor Watch has discovered violations related to occupational
589480	592040	health and safety, pollution, and work schedules.
592040	597520	An episode of toxic gas poisoning also occurred at the catcher factory in May 2017.
597520	602260	Workers interviewed revealed toxic gas sent 90 people to the hospital with five needing
602260	603600	intensive care.
603600	607760	Apple conducted its own internal investigation after the violations were reported and found
607760	608760	no abuses.
608760	609960	Well, of course you didn't.
609960	613860	It's not like these companies have had to install nets in order to prevent the deaths
613860	617340	of people who jump off their buildings hoping to commit suicide.
617340	619460	Apple's a fucking saint of a company, for sure.
619460	621060	I know, I'm getting off track here.
621060	624140	I've got no love for companies that exploit the labor of the third world.
624140	629060	But when they turn around, try to upsell us their garbage, and then chastise and rebuke
629060	632460	us with some sort of a moral argument, they can fuck right off.
632460	634740	They don't have a goddamn leg to stand on.
634740	638660	Fuck Silicon Valley, it's run by a bunch of social justice hypocrites who will virtue
638660	640940	signal one thing and then do the complete opposite.
