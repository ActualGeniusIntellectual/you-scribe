00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
So, I realized I forgot a few important issues in making the original anti-social media video,

00:06.240 --> 00:18.180
so I figured I'd just do a quick epilogue to bring a couple more things up.

00:18.180 --> 00:23.580
Because I'm a 32 year old boomer, I don't actually use Instagram or really understand

00:23.580 --> 00:24.580
its subculture.

00:24.580 --> 00:25.980
Here's basically what I know about it.

00:25.980 --> 00:29.420
It's a social media network where you post pictures and people can comment on them.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.520
That's about it.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.720
It differs from Facebook in that it's centered around pictures specifically, while Facebook

00:34.720 --> 00:39.120
is more of a general grab bag at whatever life stuff its users want to share.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.000
But since Instagram is based out of the same 300 square mile area of Southern California

00:44.000 --> 00:47.500
that all the other social media networks are, it's safe to say that it wallows in the

00:47.500 --> 00:52.260
same subculture, suffers the same ethical problems, and attempts to export the same

00:52.260 --> 00:54.140
values out to the rest of the world.

00:54.140 --> 00:58.840
The most blatant example of conservative censorship on Instagram that I can personally find is

00:58.840 --> 01:01.700
documented in this article on the Daily Wire.

01:01.700 --> 01:06.980
Instagram censors conservative columnists for saying planned parenthood kills more blacks

01:06.980 --> 01:08.800
than the KKK.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.760
Conservative columnist Ryan Baumberger, a black man who was adopted after being conceived

01:12.760 --> 01:17.520
in rape, dared to speak the truth about Planned Parenthood and abortion in general.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.060
It kills more black people than the KKK ever did.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.800
For that, Instagram censored him.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.900
Now this article is going to open up an entire can of worms that I'd rather really avoid.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.480
I did a video on abortion already if you want to go back and watch that, but for the

01:30.480 --> 01:33.340
here and now I can kind of see his point of view.

01:33.340 --> 01:37.780
If you believe that abortion is murder and that fetuses are full human beings, then it

01:37.780 --> 01:41.720
makes sense to believe that abortion clinics routinely carry out murder, certainly on a

01:41.720 --> 01:46.440
scale greater than the KKK, especially since the KKK has always been on the fringes of

01:46.440 --> 01:47.820
American politics.

01:47.820 --> 01:51.860
This is not what I personally believe regarding abortion, but it's not like Baumberger came

01:51.860 --> 01:53.980
to his conclusion irrationally.

01:53.980 --> 02:21.940
And here's the meme in question.

02:21.940 --> 02:26.880
Regardless of how you feel about abortion, should this image have been censored off Instagram?

02:26.880 --> 02:29.140
The numbers it cites are accurate.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.080
You may disagree with the framing of the data.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.940
You may think that aborted fetuses don't count as murders, but that's a different discussion.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.340
Those numbers are accurate.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.840
And either way, should it have been censored?

02:38.840 --> 02:45.380
If Instagram were considered to be a child-centered network, then maybe, but that's not the case.

02:45.380 --> 02:49.260
Instagram already has a way to place what it calls sensitive content behind a blurry

02:49.260 --> 02:53.540
filter so that if people want to see it, they have to opt in by tapping on the content

02:53.540 --> 02:54.540
itself.

02:54.540 --> 02:59.820
Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom stated in a blog post that while these posts don't violate

02:59.820 --> 03:04.220
our guidelines, someone in the community has reported them and our review team has confirmed

03:04.220 --> 03:05.220
that they're sensitive.

03:05.220 --> 03:06.880
And that's honestly fine by me.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.920
It's not censorship.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.020
The posts are still visible.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.800
You just have to click them to see them.

03:10.800 --> 03:15.320
Let's check Instagram's guidelines to see if there's a line clearly drawn between sensitive

03:15.320 --> 03:18.380
content and completely banned content.

03:18.380 --> 03:21.940
There are only photos and videos that you've taken or have the right to share.

03:21.940 --> 03:22.940
That seems fair.

03:22.940 --> 03:26.540
Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.780
The heading for this section sounds like it might be bad, but it's entirely based around

03:30.780 --> 03:31.780
nudity.

03:31.780 --> 03:34.500
The diversity mentioned seems to be diversity of age.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.740
Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.

03:36.740 --> 03:42.220
Again, it's not a helpful header because the content of the rule only mentions spam.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.220
Follow the law.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.220
Fine.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.960
Respect other members of the Instagram community.

03:45.960 --> 03:50.320
This is where the part on harassment and hate speech comes in, but Bomberger's meme didn't

03:50.320 --> 03:51.680
feature any of that.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.440
Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.640
I can only assume that Instagram model subculture has created the unfortunate side effect of

04:00.640 --> 04:03.120
anorexia promotion groups on the platform.

04:03.120 --> 04:06.100
Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.680
This pertains to violence.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.440
Don't post violent images even if they're from a newsworthy event.

04:11.440 --> 04:15.020
Bomberger's anti-abortion meme doesn't violate any of these rules.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.220
So why was it removed?

04:16.220 --> 04:18.960
Why wasn't it just placed behind a sensitive content wall?

04:18.960 --> 04:22.020
Is it because the people at Instagram disagree with his political stance?

04:22.020 --> 04:26.540
However, there is a silver lining when it comes to Instagram, and it involves SJWs shooting

04:26.540 --> 04:27.900
themselves in the foot.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.440
Remember in the last video when I said that the measures that the lefty CEOs of social

04:31.440 --> 04:36.020
media companies implement often end up hurting the rank-and-file SJWs on their side?

04:36.020 --> 04:38.560
Well, here's a great example of that from Vice.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.740
Users accuse Instagram of censoring hashtags about sex work and women.

04:42.740 --> 04:48.220
Instagram is reportedly hiding posts from some users under hashtags like women, strippers,

04:48.220 --> 04:53.180
female strippers, and sex workers rights day, while hashtags like man and male strippers

04:53.180 --> 04:54.380
remain uncensored.

04:54.380 --> 04:58.460
Under the censored hashtags, the space where photos usually appear is replaced by text

04:58.460 --> 05:02.880
that reads, top posts from this hashtag are currently hidden because the community has

05:02.880 --> 05:06.380
reported some content that may not meet Instagram's community deadlines.

05:06.380 --> 05:07.980
Oh really?

05:07.980 --> 05:09.860
Not so happy about censorship now, are you?

05:09.860 --> 05:14.100
I mean, you are all just perpetuating the male gaze or whatever other bullshit theoretical

05:14.100 --> 05:18.300
framework you use to justify censorship, so this is exactly what you wanted to happen.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.940
The truth is, the style of social justice that currently has its grip on the social

05:21.940 --> 05:25.860
media companies, as well as other segments of the political and cultural left, is an

05:25.860 --> 05:28.380
anti-sex prudish stripe.

05:28.380 --> 05:33.020
They're puritan in nature, believing that excessive displays of female sexuality only

05:33.020 --> 05:36.940
exist to serve the male gaze, and are ultimately oppressive in nature towards women.

05:36.940 --> 05:41.660
They've got more in common with conservative Christians or Islamists than the sex-positive,

05:41.660 --> 05:46.300
pro-sex worker, personal liberation feminists that have been affected by their policies.

05:46.300 --> 05:52.060
The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act make websites

05:52.060 --> 05:56.660
liable for what users say and do on their platforms, causing platforms to preemptively

05:56.660 --> 06:02.060
shutter or censor forms or entire sites where sex trafficking could feasibly happen, including

06:02.060 --> 06:04.020
the Craigslist personal page.

06:04.020 --> 06:07.960
Even before the passing of these bills, sex workers overwhelmingly warned that they would

06:07.960 --> 06:09.380
do more harm than good.

06:09.380 --> 06:14.380
And now, sex workers are reporting the devastating effects, like being forced to return to dangerous

06:14.380 --> 06:15.380
pimps.

06:15.380 --> 06:16.940
You did it, social justice.

06:16.940 --> 06:21.340
You drove those problematic women, oppressing other women with their bodies in their sex

06:21.340 --> 06:24.900
work, back underground where they can no longer be seen.

06:24.900 --> 06:28.740
Social Justice in Action I actually have little to no personal experience

06:28.740 --> 06:32.100
with Instagram in comparison to the other tech companies, so there's not really much

06:32.100 --> 06:33.100
more I can say.

06:33.180 --> 06:36.700
I just haven't been keeping my thumb on the pulse of this one, unfortunately.

06:36.700 --> 06:41.660
But I bet there's a lot more SJW BS out there, as far as Instagram is concerned.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.260
Apple Apple was one of the companies that kicked

06:51.260 --> 06:55.580
Alex Jones off its platform without due cause, the event that kicked this whole thing off.

06:55.580 --> 07:00.180
Despite Facebook and Apple not always seeing eye-to-eye, it was Apple's move that motivated

07:00.180 --> 07:01.600
Mark Zuckerberg to act.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.120
As reported in the New York Times article, Facebook banned Infowars, now what?

07:06.120 --> 07:10.560
Late Sunday, Apple, which has often tried to stake out moral high ground on contentious

07:10.560 --> 07:14.060
debates, removed Infowars podcasts from iTunes.

07:14.060 --> 07:17.820
After seeing the news, Mark Zuckerberg sent a note to his team confirming his own decision.

07:17.820 --> 07:21.860
The strikes against Infowars and Mr. Jones would count individually, and the pages would

07:21.860 --> 07:22.860
come down.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.620
The announcement arrived at 3 AM Pacific Time.

07:25.620 --> 07:29.000
But like I said, Facebook and Apple do not always see eye-to-eye.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.280
While Facebook lost nearly everybody's personal information to Cambridge Analytica,

07:33.280 --> 07:36.240
Apple is significantly more stringent with its privacy policies.

07:36.240 --> 07:41.040
Apple's CEO Tim Cook even took a pot shot at Zuckerberg, stating on MSNBC that if it

07:41.040 --> 07:43.520
were him, he wouldn't have let things get so bad.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.000
Look at this guy's face, that's a shit-eating grain if you ever saw one.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.960
Apple's stricter stance on privacy has even led them to clash with the US government.

07:55.960 --> 08:00.180
An iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters was recovered by the FBI, and Apple

08:00.180 --> 08:04.280
refused to assist the FBI in decrypting it, citing privacy concerns.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.700
This actually kicked off a legal battle between the FBI and Apple, with the government requesting

08:08.700 --> 08:13.960
Apple supply them with a back door to the phone, using a 1977 ruling on the All Writs

08:13.960 --> 08:15.280
Act as a precedent.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.720
The bit of law in question allowed the government to compel technical assistance from private

08:19.720 --> 08:22.160
phone companies in accessing call records.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.920
Apple's counterargument is that while a phone company may compile call records in

08:25.920 --> 08:30.120
the normal course of its business, Apple did not regularly unlock people's phones as

08:30.120 --> 08:33.960
a normal course of its business, and forcing Apple's software engineers to create new

08:33.960 --> 08:38.920
code to do the job would be considered a violation of the First Amendment as compelled speech,

08:38.920 --> 08:44.560
since programming code was ruled to be free speech in Bernstein vs. United States in 1996.

08:44.560 --> 08:50.360
So we can all rest easy, knowing that even in the face of overwhelming government pressure,

08:50.360 --> 08:54.520
Apple will not bend, and won't give up all of our private info.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.480
Apple iCloud data in China now stored by state-owned company.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.000
Apple officially moves its Chinese iCloud operations and encryption keys to China.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.800
Oh, so when it's the American government asking for one person's data, fuck you we

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
take a stand.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.200
But when it's the Chinese government asking for everyone's data?

09:12.200 --> 09:16.480
Of course, they're trustworthy, give them the cloud data, give them the encryption keys,

09:16.480 --> 09:17.480
give them everything.

09:17.480 --> 09:21.000
So China's decided to purge 25,000 apps from the Apple Store?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.560
It's okay, they didn't need their free speech, don't worry about it.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.320
Of course, we all know why Apple bends over backward for the Chinese government.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.160
Apple makes all their shit in China, marks it up, and sells it in the West.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.840
Everybody knows that Apple stuff is overpriced garbage that appeals to rich city hipsters,

09:35.840 --> 09:40.200
and that the regular Chinese working person suffers greatly to make it for those rich

09:40.200 --> 09:41.520
city hipsters.

09:41.520 --> 09:45.160
Labor and health violations rampant at Apple supplier in China.

09:45.160 --> 09:49.480
An investigation by China Labor Watch has discovered violations related to occupational

09:49.480 --> 09:52.040
health and safety, pollution, and work schedules.

09:52.040 --> 09:57.520
An episode of toxic gas poisoning also occurred at the catcher factory in May 2017.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.260
Workers interviewed revealed toxic gas sent 90 people to the hospital with five needing

10:02.260 --> 10:03.600
intensive care.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.760
Apple conducted its own internal investigation after the violations were reported and found

10:07.760 --> 10:08.760
no abuses.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.960
Well, of course you didn't.

10:09.960 --> 10:13.860
It's not like these companies have had to install nets in order to prevent the deaths

10:13.860 --> 10:17.340
of people who jump off their buildings hoping to commit suicide.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.460
Apple's a fucking saint of a company, for sure.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.060
I know, I'm getting off track here.

10:21.060 --> 10:24.140
I've got no love for companies that exploit the labor of the third world.

10:24.140 --> 10:29.060
But when they turn around, try to upsell us their garbage, and then chastise and rebuke

10:29.060 --> 10:32.460
us with some sort of a moral argument, they can fuck right off.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.740
They don't have a goddamn leg to stand on.

10:34.740 --> 10:38.660
Fuck Silicon Valley, it's run by a bunch of social justice hypocrites who will virtue

10:38.660 --> 10:40.940
signal one thing and then do the complete opposite.
