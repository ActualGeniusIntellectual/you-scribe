1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
So, I realized I forgot a few important issues in making the original anti-social media video,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:18,180
so I figured I'd just do a quick epilogue to bring a couple more things up.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,580
Because I'm a 32 year old boomer, I don't actually use Instagram or really understand

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,580
its subculture.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,980
Here's basically what I know about it.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,420
It's a social media network where you post pictures and people can comment on them.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,520
That's about it.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,720
It differs from Facebook in that it's centered around pictures specifically, while Facebook

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,120
is more of a general grab bag at whatever life stuff its users want to share.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,000
But since Instagram is based out of the same 300 square mile area of Southern California

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
that all the other social media networks are, it's safe to say that it wallows in the

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,260
same subculture, suffers the same ethical problems, and attempts to export the same

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,140
values out to the rest of the world.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,840
The most blatant example of conservative censorship on Instagram that I can personally find is

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,700
documented in this article on the Daily Wire.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,980
Instagram censors conservative columnists for saying planned parenthood kills more blacks

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,800
than the KKK.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,760
Conservative columnist Ryan Baumberger, a black man who was adopted after being conceived

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,520
in rape, dared to speak the truth about Planned Parenthood and abortion in general.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,060
It kills more black people than the KKK ever did.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,800
For that, Instagram censored him.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,900
Now this article is going to open up an entire can of worms that I'd rather really avoid.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,480
I did a video on abortion already if you want to go back and watch that, but for the

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,340
here and now I can kind of see his point of view.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,780
If you believe that abortion is murder and that fetuses are full human beings, then it

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,720
makes sense to believe that abortion clinics routinely carry out murder, certainly on a

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,440
scale greater than the KKK, especially since the KKK has always been on the fringes of

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,820
American politics.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,860
This is not what I personally believe regarding abortion, but it's not like Baumberger came

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,980
to his conclusion irrationally.

31
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:21,940
And here's the meme in question.

32
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,880
Regardless of how you feel about abortion, should this image have been censored off Instagram?

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,140
The numbers it cites are accurate.

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,080
You may disagree with the framing of the data.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,940
You may think that aborted fetuses don't count as murders, but that's a different discussion.

36
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,340
Those numbers are accurate.

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,840
And either way, should it have been censored?

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,380
If Instagram were considered to be a child-centered network, then maybe, but that's not the case.

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,260
Instagram already has a way to place what it calls sensitive content behind a blurry

40
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,540
filter so that if people want to see it, they have to opt in by tapping on the content

41
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,540
itself.

42
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,820
Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom stated in a blog post that while these posts don't violate

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,220
our guidelines, someone in the community has reported them and our review team has confirmed

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
that they're sensitive.

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,880
And that's honestly fine by me.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
It's not censorship.

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,020
The posts are still visible.

48
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,800
You just have to click them to see them.

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,320
Let's check Instagram's guidelines to see if there's a line clearly drawn between sensitive

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,380
content and completely banned content.

51
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,940
There are only photos and videos that you've taken or have the right to share.

52
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
That seems fair.

53
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,540
Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,780
The heading for this section sounds like it might be bad, but it's entirely based around

55
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
nudity.

56
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,500
The diversity mentioned seems to be diversity of age.

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,740
Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.

58
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,220
Again, it's not a helpful header because the content of the rule only mentions spam.

59
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,220
Follow the law.

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,220
Fine.

61
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,960
Respect other members of the Instagram community.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,320
This is where the part on harassment and hate speech comes in, but Bomberger's meme didn't

63
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,680
feature any of that.

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,440
Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,640
I can only assume that Instagram model subculture has created the unfortunate side effect of

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
anorexia promotion groups on the platform.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,100
Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.

68
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,680
This pertains to violence.

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,440
Don't post violent images even if they're from a newsworthy event.

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,020
Bomberger's anti-abortion meme doesn't violate any of these rules.

71
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,220
So why was it removed?

72
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,960
Why wasn't it just placed behind a sensitive content wall?

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,020
Is it because the people at Instagram disagree with his political stance?

74
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,540
However, there is a silver lining when it comes to Instagram, and it involves SJWs shooting

75
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,900
themselves in the foot.

76
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,440
Remember in the last video when I said that the measures that the lefty CEOs of social

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,020
media companies implement often end up hurting the rank-and-file SJWs on their side?

78
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,560
Well, here's a great example of that from Vice.

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,740
Users accuse Instagram of censoring hashtags about sex work and women.

80
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,220
Instagram is reportedly hiding posts from some users under hashtags like women, strippers,

81
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,180
female strippers, and sex workers rights day, while hashtags like man and male strippers

82
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,380
remain uncensored.

83
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,460
Under the censored hashtags, the space where photos usually appear is replaced by text

84
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,880
that reads, top posts from this hashtag are currently hidden because the community has

85
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,380
reported some content that may not meet Instagram's community deadlines.

86
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,980
Oh really?

87
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,860
Not so happy about censorship now, are you?

88
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,100
I mean, you are all just perpetuating the male gaze or whatever other bullshit theoretical

89
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,300
framework you use to justify censorship, so this is exactly what you wanted to happen.

90
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,940
The truth is, the style of social justice that currently has its grip on the social

91
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,860
media companies, as well as other segments of the political and cultural left, is an

92
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,380
anti-sex prudish stripe.

93
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,020
They're puritan in nature, believing that excessive displays of female sexuality only

94
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,940
exist to serve the male gaze, and are ultimately oppressive in nature towards women.

95
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,660
They've got more in common with conservative Christians or Islamists than the sex-positive,

96
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,300
pro-sex worker, personal liberation feminists that have been affected by their policies.

97
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,060
The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act make websites

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,660
liable for what users say and do on their platforms, causing platforms to preemptively

99
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,060
shutter or censor forms or entire sites where sex trafficking could feasibly happen, including

100
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,020
the Craigslist personal page.

101
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,960
Even before the passing of these bills, sex workers overwhelmingly warned that they would

102
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,380
do more harm than good.

103
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,380
And now, sex workers are reporting the devastating effects, like being forced to return to dangerous

104
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
pimps.

105
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,940
You did it, social justice.

106
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,340
You drove those problematic women, oppressing other women with their bodies in their sex

107
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,900
work, back underground where they can no longer be seen.

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,740
Social Justice in Action I actually have little to no personal experience

109
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,100
with Instagram in comparison to the other tech companies, so there's not really much

110
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
more I can say.

111
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,700
I just haven't been keeping my thumb on the pulse of this one, unfortunately.

112
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,660
But I bet there's a lot more SJW BS out there, as far as Instagram is concerned.

113
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,260
Apple Apple was one of the companies that kicked

114
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,580
Alex Jones off its platform without due cause, the event that kicked this whole thing off.

115
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,180
Despite Facebook and Apple not always seeing eye-to-eye, it was Apple's move that motivated

116
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,600
Mark Zuckerberg to act.

117
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,120
As reported in the New York Times article, Facebook banned Infowars, now what?

118
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,560
Late Sunday, Apple, which has often tried to stake out moral high ground on contentious

119
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,060
debates, removed Infowars podcasts from iTunes.

120
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,820
After seeing the news, Mark Zuckerberg sent a note to his team confirming his own decision.

121
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,860
The strikes against Infowars and Mr. Jones would count individually, and the pages would

122
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
come down.

123
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,620
The announcement arrived at 3 AM Pacific Time.

124
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,000
But like I said, Facebook and Apple do not always see eye-to-eye.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,280
While Facebook lost nearly everybody's personal information to Cambridge Analytica,

126
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Apple is significantly more stringent with its privacy policies.

127
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Apple's CEO Tim Cook even took a pot shot at Zuckerberg, stating on MSNBC that if it

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,520
were him, he wouldn't have let things get so bad.

129
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
Look at this guy's face, that's a shit-eating grain if you ever saw one.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,960
Apple's stricter stance on privacy has even led them to clash with the US government.

131
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,180
An iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters was recovered by the FBI, and Apple

132
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,280
refused to assist the FBI in decrypting it, citing privacy concerns.

133
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,700
This actually kicked off a legal battle between the FBI and Apple, with the government requesting

134
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,960
Apple supply them with a back door to the phone, using a 1977 ruling on the All Writs

135
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
Act as a precedent.

136
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,720
The bit of law in question allowed the government to compel technical assistance from private

137
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,160
phone companies in accessing call records.

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,920
Apple's counterargument is that while a phone company may compile call records in

139
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,120
the normal course of its business, Apple did not regularly unlock people's phones as

140
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,960
a normal course of its business, and forcing Apple's software engineers to create new

141
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,920
code to do the job would be considered a violation of the First Amendment as compelled speech,

142
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,560
since programming code was ruled to be free speech in Bernstein vs. United States in 1996.

143
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,360
So we can all rest easy, knowing that even in the face of overwhelming government pressure,

144
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,520
Apple will not bend, and won't give up all of our private info.

145
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Apple iCloud data in China now stored by state-owned company.

146
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,000
Apple officially moves its Chinese iCloud operations and encryption keys to China.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Oh, so when it's the American government asking for one person's data, fuck you we

148
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
take a stand.

149
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,200
But when it's the Chinese government asking for everyone's data?

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,480
Of course, they're trustworthy, give them the cloud data, give them the encryption keys,

151
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
give them everything.

152
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,000
So China's decided to purge 25,000 apps from the Apple Store?

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,560
It's okay, they didn't need their free speech, don't worry about it.

154
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,320
Of course, we all know why Apple bends over backward for the Chinese government.

155
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,160
Apple makes all their shit in China, marks it up, and sells it in the West.

156
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,840
Everybody knows that Apple stuff is overpriced garbage that appeals to rich city hipsters,

157
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,200
and that the regular Chinese working person suffers greatly to make it for those rich

158
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,520
city hipsters.

159
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,160
Labor and health violations rampant at Apple supplier in China.

160
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,480
An investigation by China Labor Watch has discovered violations related to occupational

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,040
health and safety, pollution, and work schedules.

162
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,520
An episode of toxic gas poisoning also occurred at the catcher factory in May 2017.

163
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,260
Workers interviewed revealed toxic gas sent 90 people to the hospital with five needing

164
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,600
intensive care.

165
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,760
Apple conducted its own internal investigation after the violations were reported and found

166
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
no abuses.

167
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,960
Well, of course you didn't.

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,860
It's not like these companies have had to install nets in order to prevent the deaths

169
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,340
of people who jump off their buildings hoping to commit suicide.

170
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,460
Apple's a fucking saint of a company, for sure.

171
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,060
I know, I'm getting off track here.

172
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,140
I've got no love for companies that exploit the labor of the third world.

173
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,060
But when they turn around, try to upsell us their garbage, and then chastise and rebuke

174
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,460
us with some sort of a moral argument, they can fuck right off.

175
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,740
They don't have a goddamn leg to stand on.

176
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,660
Fuck Silicon Valley, it's run by a bunch of social justice hypocrites who will virtue

177
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,940
signal one thing and then do the complete opposite.
