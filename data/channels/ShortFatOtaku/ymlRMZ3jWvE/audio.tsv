0	3420	Hey guys, I was gone for a day because I was having new internet installed, but in the
3420	7320	interim I have since signed up to Parler!
7320	11340	That's right, that app that is currently going viral as a Twitter alternative.
11340	16680	Who knows how good it is, I'll dig into its depths a little bit later, but for now I have
16680	21860	reviewed or reserved my username and I'll be using it at least a little bit.
21860	28260	So I'm at parler.com slash profile slash short fat otaku.
28260	31540	I figure if you just search for short fat otaku it should probably come up.
31540	37980	Wait, hold on, I didn't type this, this isn't my first message, my first message was hi.
37980	40940	Did it automatically tweet this or I guess Parler it for me?
40940	44580	Okay well anyway, let's send that.
44580	49580	Yep, I come up as the only user under the name of short fat otaku, so if you use Parler,
49580	54580	if you're getting on the twigzit as they're calling it, you can find me there and hopefully
54580	56620	I'll see you over there.
56620	58100	Check you out later, I love you.
