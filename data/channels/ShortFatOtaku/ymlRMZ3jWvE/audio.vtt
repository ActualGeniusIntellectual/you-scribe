Hey guys, I was gone for a day because I was having new internet installed, but in the

00:03.420 --> 00:07.320
interim I have since signed up to Parler!

00:07.320 --> 00:11.340
That's right, that app that is currently going viral as a Twitter alternative.

00:11.340 --> 00:16.680
Who knows how good it is, I'll dig into its depths a little bit later, but for now I have

00:16.680 --> 00:21.860
reviewed or reserved my username and I'll be using it at least a little bit.

00:21.860 --> 00:28.260
So I'm at parler.com slash profile slash short fat otaku.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.540
I figure if you just search for short fat otaku it should probably come up.

00:31.540 --> 00:37.980
Wait, hold on, I didn't type this, this isn't my first message, my first message was hi.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.940
Did it automatically tweet this or I guess Parler it for me?

00:40.940 --> 00:44.580
Okay well anyway, let's send that.

00:44.580 --> 00:49.580
Yep, I come up as the only user under the name of short fat otaku, so if you use Parler,

00:49.580 --> 00:54.580
if you're getting on the twigzit as they're calling it, you can find me there and hopefully

00:54.580 --> 00:56.620
I'll see you over there.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.100
Check you out later, I love you.
