Hey guys, I was gone for a day because I was having new internet installed, but in the

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,320
interim I have since signed up to Parler!

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,340
That's right, that app that is currently going viral as a Twitter alternative.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,680
Who knows how good it is, I'll dig into its depths a little bit later, but for now I have

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,860
reviewed or reserved my username and I'll be using it at least a little bit.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:28,260
So I'm at parler.com slash profile slash short fat otaku.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,540
I figure if you just search for short fat otaku it should probably come up.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,980
Wait, hold on, I didn't type this, this isn't my first message, my first message was hi.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,940
Did it automatically tweet this or I guess Parler it for me?

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,580
Okay well anyway, let's send that.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,580
Yep, I come up as the only user under the name of short fat otaku, so if you use Parler,

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,580
if you're getting on the twigzit as they're calling it, you can find me there and hopefully

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,620
I'll see you over there.

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,100
Check you out later, I love you.
