00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly number 14 for the 23rd of September 2018.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,100
I almost forgot to do this one.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,520
I've been spending the whole day house cleaning.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,020
I've cleaned the recording studio, I've cleaned the office, I've cleaned the bedrooms, I've

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,720
cleaned the bathrooms, the kitchen, the living room, the porch, everything, pretty much everything

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,160
now, without my girlfriend.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,480
And honestly, it sounds kind of weird to say, but it feels good to have it all clean.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,680
It feels good to like sit down in a clean house.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:40,160
So I've decided to take a break with a delicious sweet green tea and look over some bullshit

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
with you guys.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,160
Here, just listen to this.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Oh yeah baby.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:53,260
Mmm, that's good stuff.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,520
So today we have, from USA Today, Donald Trump broke the presidency.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,760
It's time to get rid of the job altogether.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,260
So now we're at the point where the media is advocating for the dissolution of democracy

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,460
because they still can't get their way.

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,980
Donald Trump is proof that the US presidency is broken and democracy is in peril.

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,100
It's time to amend the constitution and abolish the presidency.

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,540
Why?

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:28,060
I mean, you might even be able to make a decent political argument as to why the US constitution

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,660
should be amended and the presidency should be replaced with like a prime ministership

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,300
maybe or a different style of democratic government, something different.

24
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,840
You could have that conversation, but this is quite literally just abolish the presidency

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,720
because we keep losing and we can't compete.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,100
Abolish the POTUS.

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,180
We've seen it.

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,860
The belligerent typo-ridden tweets, the fawning press conferences with autocrats and overlords,

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,100
the self-described Nazis on parade praising an American president's name.

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,940
We've seen it with our own eyes.

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,060
There is a bloated authoritarian lounging in his bathrobe in a 200 year old mansion

32
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,620
that used to symbolize the principal republic of the world.

33
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,380
Yeah, that's all true, at least on some level.

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,540
And what makes it more interesting is that despite all of those flaws that you're attributing

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,700
to Trump, you still couldn't beat him at the polls.

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,060
Your preferred candidate was considered to be worse by the American people.

37
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,820
This is a man who openly conspired to cheat with the help of a hostile foreign nation

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
in a federal election.

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,580
Yeah, they're talking about Russia here and really the left has loved Russia up until

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,640
recently.

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,300
On election night, he came in second place, yet due to a scab of slavery in the constitution,

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,320
the electoral college, this usurper has the full power of the most powerful- I can't-

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,120
okay, I can't fucking keep going.

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,360
The electoral college is not a scab of slavery, the electoral college is in place to ensure

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,400
that densely populated cities with their monoform culture don't get to rule over the entire

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,120
nation, including the hinterlands of it.

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,160
Because people in the city have no idea how people in the country live, and vice versa.

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,440
So they can't simply be trusted to make decisions for the good of both.

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,780
I mean, right now you have these elitist leftists who live in San Francisco and LA and New York

50
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,780
City who think that they know best for everyone on the planet, and the truth is they don't.

51
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,220
But they think that their ideas are how society should be set up, not knowing that if it were

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,420
actually that way, it would completely destroy everyone not living in their coastal elite

53
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,740
urban centers.

54
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:54,540
And because they don't know that, they simply can't be trusted with a direct majority, which

55
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,140
is why the electoral college exists.

56
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,840
Here let me couch it in SJW rhetoric.

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,400
The electoral college exists to provide some level of privilege to an oppressed class of

58
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,440
people, the people who can't afford to live anywhere but the fucking sticks.

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,600
This usurper has the full power of the most powerful military in history, command of the

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,760
treasury, the absolute power to pardon and he can unilaterally annihilate millions of

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,480
people with his command to deploy nuclear weapons.

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,320
He's made refugees begging us for mercy into orphans hoping it will deter other asylum

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,280
seekers, because he can.

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,740
He's now poised to put a man on the supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, who believes in supreme

65
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,100
leaders, if they're republican that is.

66
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:43,400
This may be the most ridiculously skewed paragraph I have ever read on a mainstream media outlet.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,720
It's pretty incredible.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,640
Russia attacked our country.

69
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,960
The target was Hillary Clinton and liberal democracy, and they hit their mark.

70
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,040
Now I'm no expert on the subject, but as far as I know, Russian involvement in the American

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,760
election basically amounted to uncovering Hillary Clinton's emails and showing the truth

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,480
to the American population about all the terrible shit she had done, and in that case we actually

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:19,560
owe the Russians a debt of gratitude.

74
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,200
If you're stunned that President Donald Trump is still in office because he's so horrible

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,700
and so unpopular and so obviously corrupt, you are not alone.

76
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,760
The overwhelming majority agrees with you.

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,360
Only about 25% of eligible voters voted for President grab him by the pussy, yet the majority

78
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,080
was apparently powerless to stop him.

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
Well if you feel that way, impeach him.

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,100
Here's what you do.

81
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,000
The 2018 elections are coming up.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,600
If you felt this way maybe a year ago, you should have fielded candidates who one, were

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,080
willing to impeach Donald Trump, two, had other qualities to them that would make them

84
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,520
electable by their various constituents, and then once they got into office in 2018,

85
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
impeach Donald Trump.

86
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,860
That's how you do it.

87
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,840
If you actually think that you are part of the overwhelming majority, then surely you

88
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,600
could have rustled all this up, but you haven't.

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,640
All you've been doing since 2016, hell, since Brexit, is throwing a long unending tantrum.

90
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,580
But of course, she talks about impeachment right here.

91
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,880
Impeachment won't remove Trump from office.

92
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,080
The remedy in our constitution for a treasonous turncoat who got into the White House in our

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
technicality is impeachment.

94
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,480
But guess what?

95
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,160
Impeachment has never gotten rid of a bad president in this country.

96
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Not ever.

97
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,780
Bill Clinton finished his term after being impeached.

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,640
The threat of impeachment got Nixon to step down, but impeachment as a whole has failed.

99
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,200
It's never lived up to its promise.

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,700
Well that's the problem isn't it?

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,320
Because Bill Clinton wasn't a treasonous turncoat.

102
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,920
He lied about an affair he had.

103
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,200
That's basically it, and you're not going to get someone kicked out of the White House

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,240
for having an affair.

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,400
If Trump is as bad as you say, and you are the majority the way that you say you are,

106
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,200
you should be able to impeach him, and that should lead to him getting kicked out of the

107
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
White House.

108
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,080
However, he's not, and you can't.

109
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,640
Abolish presidency to save democracy.

110
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,280
We can make that happen.

111
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,040
My fear isn't Trump.

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,160
It's that the next autocrat is most likely smarter and savvier than Trump.

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,320
Every partisan from every niche of American politics should be alarmed.

114
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,240
We have a branch of government that stinks so bad it's wafted over the entire nation

115
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,960
and its outer territories.

116
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,480
The entire world sees it.

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,520
We're in trouble.

118
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,240
The presidency is broken.

119
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,920
Our little democratic experiment is in peril.

120
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,000
To be honest, it would be worse under Hillary.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,120
And it would be worse under Hillary.

122
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,500
Trump is, he's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.

123
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,720
He's actually probably not that good of a president, but he is the president that the

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,700
United States needed at this point in time.

125
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,160
And all of this whining because you lost.

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
I mean, let's be honest here.

127
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,020
This article would not have been written if Hillary won the presidency, even though she

128
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,920
would have been objectively worse than Trump.

129
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,360
We can amend our constitution to save the republic, abolish the presidency, power to

130
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,640
the people, power to the Congress, make the co-equal branches of government more equal.

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,500
Give us a council of boring bureaucrats who will do their jobs, serve the people and leave

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,240
after their term ends.

133
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Well, frankly, that is what Congress should be.

134
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,240
And as I recall, Trump ran on making Congress have term limits.

135
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,960
Now, who knows if he'll ever actually get that done.

136
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,240
In fact, he probably won't get that done.

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,920
Maybe he'll get it done on a second term because by then he really won't give a shit.

138
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,520
Just like Obama didn't give a shit on a second term.

139
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:51,360
But your complaint here seems to be that Congress doesn't have term limits.

140
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,680
And Trump, well, Trump agrees with you on that one.

141
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,080
Considering that the author of this article sounds like a fucking snowflake, let's move

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,760
on to the next one titled Don't Call Us Snowflakes, It Damages Our Mental Health, Say Young People.

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,240
This is quite the image.

144
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,080
This is an incredible image.

145
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,560
Being called a snowflake is damaging to mental health, young people say.

146
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,220
Figures show, which figures are we talking about here, that the majority of young people

147
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,000
think the term is unfair and even more think it could have a negative effect on its own.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,120
Well, maybe you shouldn't be fucking snowflakes then.

149
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Holy fuck.

150
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Okay.

151
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
Can you imagine if this were flipped on its head?

152
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,280
Imagine if a bunch of young conservatives or alt-right people came out and said, don't

153
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,360
call us Nazis.

154
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,680
It's damaging to our mental health.

155
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,080
Whether or not they were actually Nazis, let's just put that aside for a minute.

156
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,280
They're just saying, don't call us Nazis.

157
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,720
They would be universally shat on by everyone.

158
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,120
The honest truth is, not only can you not choose your pronoun, well, I mean, you can

159
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
to an extent.

160
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
You can be polite about it.

161
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,600
Like if you're a trans person who gets misgendered, you can politely ask that somebody call you

162
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,240
by a different set of pronouns.

163
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,520
If they don't listen to you, they're being a dick, but it's their choice, right?

164
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,440
But not only can you not choose your pronoun really, you can't choose your adjective.

165
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,280
And this snowflake business is kind of an extension of the choosing your pronouns stuff

166
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:28,600
because basically what it boils down to is people saying, hey, I get to control what

167
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,640
you say about me because what you say about me might be damaging to me.

168
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,440
So if you misgender me, I should have some kind of power over you to make you stop doing

169
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
that.

170
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,320
And if you can do it for pronouns, why can't you do it for adjectives?

171
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,040
It's the same logic, right?

172
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Don't call me a snowflake.

173
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,720
It makes me feel bad.

174
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,120
It's damaging me.

175
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,280
So therefore you must be controlled.

176
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,660
Then we can take it further.

177
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,960
Don't call me an idiot.

178
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,360
Don't call me stupid.

179
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,600
Don't call me dumb.

180
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
Don't call me slow.

181
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,960
Don't call me anything that I don't want you to call me.

182
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,560
That's the end result of this political correctness bullshit is this snowflake stupidity here.

183
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,600
The snowflake generation is a disparaging term now commonly used to refer to young people

184
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,400
who are perceived to be oversensitive and intolerant of disagreement.

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,080
Well that's because they are.

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,000
They can't tolerate any kind of disagreement.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,120
Whenever there's a speaker at a university they don't like, they'll pull the fire alarm.

188
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,040
They'll attack people wearing black masks over disagreements.

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,240
It's ridiculous bullshit.

190
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,560
Research by insurance firm Aviva found that 72% of 16 to 24 year olds think the term is

191
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,000
unfairly applied, while 74% think it could have a negative effect on young people's mental

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
health.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,760
Well of course they're pulling this card because it's how they've controlled the conversation

194
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
so far.

195
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,320
If you're somebody who is willing to use violence to accomplish your political objectives, and

196
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,440
then somebody calls you violent knowing that to be perceived to be violent by the public

197
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,480
at large is a negative thing, they're now going to want to control your speech and say

198
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
don't call me violent.

199
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
Even though you objectively are violent, that person is going to say don't call me violent

200
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,320
because it looks bad.

201
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
And that's what this is.

202
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
It's not quite the same thing.

203
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,560
We're talking about snowflakes, not violence, but it's a related idea.

204
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,040
These people know that they are intolerant of debates.

205
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,320
These people know that they're intolerant of different types of ideas.

206
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,160
They do it in the name of battling oppression or whatever.

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,680
And they know that the public perception of them is that they're basically sissies.

208
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Is that they can't handle anything outside of their bubble.

209
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,200
So they're called snowflakes and they don't like that.

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,280
The figures also show that young people are more likely to have experienced stress, anxiety

211
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,080
and depression in the last year.

212
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,440
Get off Tumblr.

213
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,240
I'm sure some of this is real.

214
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,400
Some people have some terrible situations they're going through.

215
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,720
But you live in the most privileged society in the most privileged time on earth.

216
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,160
Get off Tumblr.

217
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,000
Recognize the opportunities you have laid out in front of you.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
And get to work.

219
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,640
That's why you have stress, you have anxiety and you're depressed.

220
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,960
The phrase which originated in America has particularly come to refer to universities

221
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,480
and students who use trigger warnings to alert readers or listeners to potentially

222
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,600
distressing material and safe spaces which are meant to be free of certain opinions or

223
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
ideas.

224
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
You said it right there.

225
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,920
The safe space is meant to be free of opinions and ideas.

226
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,160
Now what is it that a snowflake was described as?

227
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,400
Let me just find it up here.

228
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,320
Snowflake generation perceived to be oversensitive and intolerant of disagreement.

229
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,280
What is a safe space for snowflakes?

230
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh, a place where there's no contrary opinions and ideas.

231
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Maybe in that place there will be no disagreement.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,560
It is also used to imply that young people are less resilient than older generations

233
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
and quicker to take offense.

234
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
Well, that is generally true, isn't it?

235
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,680
I mean, young people have had a lot less experience with the world.

236
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,960
It's not just in terms of being resilient or quicker to take offense, it's also in

237
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:21,640
terms of, you know, physical strength, experience, capability of dealing with loss, emotional

238
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,120
maturity, physical maturity, job experience, wisdom, like there's a whole bunch of things

239
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,780
that age brings with it, man.

240
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,720
And that's just how it is, I mean, maybe you feel discriminated against by time, but

241
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,400
good luck winning that battle.

242
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,480
It is thought to originate with U.S. author Chuck Pahalanuck's 1996 book Fight Club,

243
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,960
which contains the line, you are not special, you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.

244
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,280
And he's, he's right.

245
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,360
I mean, being special, there's, there's, I don't know, that's been another video idea

246
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,160
that I've been rattling around in my head is snowflakes and being special because there's

247
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:06,320
more to it than just you are not special because in as many ways as you're not special, you

248
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
are also special.

249
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,400
However, it's important to recognize which ways you're special, which ways you're not,

250
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,080
and not simply assume things are the way that you want them to be.

251
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
It's a very complicated topic.

252
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Maybe I'll talk about it some other time, but let's move on to the guardians, the myth

253
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,120
of freedom.

254
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,240
Governments and corporations will soon know you better than you know yourself.

255
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,160
belief in the idea of free will has become dangerous.

256
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,280
We are now at the point where humanity needs to be stripped of free will according to the

257
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,380
far left.

258
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,560
Should scholars serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony?

259
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,920
Yes.

260
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,800
Okay.

261
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:02,360
You you're already starting the article with, I think the worst thing I've, I've read in

262
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
a long fucking time.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,300
They should serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony.

265
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,880
How is that even a question?

266
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,480
Should you expose a fiction even if that fiction sustains the social order?

267
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,320
In writing my latest book, 21 lessons for the 21st century, I had to struggle with this

268
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,520
dilemma with regard to liberalism.

269
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,000
On the one hand, I believe that the liberal story is flawed, that it does not tell the

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,160
truth about humanity, and that in order to survive and flourish in the 21st century,

271
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,760
we need to go beyond it.

272
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,880
Well, the problem is, one, I don't know what type of liberal this person is talking about.

273
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,720
Oftentimes when people say liberal nowadays, they mean left, and liberalism is not an idea

274
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,860
that is specifically tied to the left.

275
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,080
The left's progressive wings and Marxist wings are very anti-liberal, right?

276
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,600
However, if we're talking about liberalism, actual liberalism, you know, valuing free

277
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,920
will, which apparently this author does not, but valuing free will, valuing choice, valuing

278
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,880
equality of opportunity, valuing an open market, you know?

279
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,680
With a social safety net, yes, but an open market, these things are liberalism.

280
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:25,360
And if she's talking about this type of liberalism, there's no going beyond that.

281
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,560
That is basically the political apex, in my opinion, that humanity is ever going to reach.

282
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,800
I mean, maybe not, maybe we'll find something different that's more amazing, but belief

283
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:43,680
in the supremacy of the individual is why we had the industrial revolution, why we had

284
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,080
the computer revolution, why we had any form of human rights movements, why we have a reasonable

285
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,640
amount of environmentalism in society, why we have any of the things that make our society

286
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,700
the greatest society to ever exist.

287
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,280
That's because of liberalism, that's because of the value of the individual.

288
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,860
This person doesn't fucking understand what they're talking about.

289
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,600
What's more, liberalism is now attacked by religious and nationalist fanatics who believe

290
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,980
in nostalgic fantasies that are far more dangerous and harmful.

291
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,580
Now that describes Islam, but because this is the Guardian, I have to assume they're

292
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,900
not talking about Islam.

293
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,800
liberalism's great advantage over other ideologies is that it is flexible and undogmatic.

294
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,300
It can sustain criticism better than any other social order.

295
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,700
Indeed, it is the only social order that allows people to question even its own foundations.

296
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,780
Liberalism has already survived three big crises, the first world war, the fascist challenge

297
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,020
in the 1930s, and the communist challenge in the 1950s to 70s.

298
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,940
If you think liberalism is in trouble now, just remember how much worse things were in

299
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,700
1918, 1938, or 1968.

300
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,420
See, so far this person seems to basically be on the money, but then we kinda get into

301
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,760
some weird territory here.

302
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,060
Liberalism is founded on the belief in human liberty.

303
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,540
Unlike rats and monkeys, human beings are supposed to have free will.

304
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,760
This is what makes human feelings and human choices the ultimate moral and political authority

305
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,420
in the world.

306
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,500
Liberalism tells us that the voter knows best, that the customer is always right, and that

307
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,580
we should think for ourselves and follow our hearts.

308
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,220
Unfortunately, free will isn't a scientific reality.

309
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,340
It is a myth inherited from Christian theology.

310
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,540
Theologians developed the idea of free will to explain why God is right to punish sinners

311
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,460
for their bad choices and reward saints for their good choices.

312
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,940
If our choices aren't made freely, why should God punish or reward us for them?

313
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,100
According to theologians, it is reasonable for God to do so because our choices reflect

314
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,500
the free will of our eternal souls, which are independent of all physical and biological

315
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
constraints.

316
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,260
This myth has little to do with what science now teaches us about homo sapiens and other

317
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
animals.

318
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,460
Humans certainly have a will, but it isn't free.

319
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,820
You cannot decide what desires you have.

320
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,140
You don't decide to be introverted or extroverted, easygoing or anxious, gay or straight.

321
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,780
Humans make choices, but they are never independent choices.

322
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,780
If every choice depends on a lot of biological, social, and personal conditions that you cannot

323
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,860
determine for yourself, I can choose what to eat, whom to marry, and whom to vote for,

324
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,820
but these choices are determined in part by my genes, my biochemistry, my gender, my

325
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,340
family background, my national culture, etc.

326
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,780
I didn't choose which genes or family to have.

327
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,040
The problem with this point of view is that it's conflating circumstances with choices

328
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,700
and they're not the same thing.

329
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,140
What's a good example?

330
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,420
Boogie is a good example.

331
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:45,100
Boogie was like a 600 pound goliath of a man, like grotesquely fat, okay?

332
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,060
But he has made the choice to make some lifestyle changes, and there was definitely some surgery

333
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,960
along with that, but he made choices.

334
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,100
In fact, the choice to get the surgery was a choice too, and as a result of those choices,

335
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
he's losing weight.

336
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,500
He's significantly thinner than he was before.

337
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,900
Circumstances are not choices, and they can influence choices, but people always have

338
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,260
the ability to choose beyond their circumstances.

339
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,500
A fat person who has been fat their whole life, who chooses beyond their circumstances

340
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,320
to become thin, that's free will.

341
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,600
An alcoholic who has been drinking for 20 years, who makes the choice to stop, that's

342
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
free will.

343
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,660
It's not easy, no one's saying that it's easy, but the choice is still there.

344
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,300
This is not an abstract theory.

345
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,500
You can witness this easily.

346
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,900
Just observe the next thought that pops up in your mind.

347
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,040
Where did it come from?

348
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,120
Did you freely choose to think it?

349
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Obviously not.

350
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,960
If you carefully observe your own mind, you come to realize that you have little control

351
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,880
of what's going on there, and that you are not choosing freely what to think, what to

352
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,380
feel, and what to want.

353
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,380
That's partially true.

354
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,960
However, that does not disprove free will, does it?

355
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,920
I mean, yeah, there's obviously some kind of unconscious part of your mind that you

356
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,840
do not have any kind of free will over.

357
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,280
You're going to get stray thoughts, you're going to get dreams, you're going to get all

358
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,880
these situations, and yet you can still choose what you do with them.

359
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,520
You can get some kind of thought in your mind, you can choose to ignore it, you can choose

360
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,300
to act on it, you can choose to ruminate on it but not actually perform any action.

361
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,640
You can do a lot of things.

362
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,760
Just because there are some uncontrollable parts of yourself doesn't mean that you are,

363
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,480
on the whole, uncontrollable.

364
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,540
There's a lot of thought experiments in this article, it's probably actually worth reading,

365
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,460
but let's get down to the end of it here.

366
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,920
If humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don't reflect our free

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,540
will, what should the point of politics be?

368
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,780
That's actually a very good question.

369
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:57,300
However, I'm not sure that those ifs that you started with, those presuppositions, are

370
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
actually true.

371
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,500
But I think there's a far worse problem here than even just politics.

372
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:10,380
If free will really is gone, let's say that it just turns out that undeniably, unrefutably,

373
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,240
there is zero free will.

374
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,500
Not all free will, not partial free will and partial uncontrollability.

375
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Zero free will.

376
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,940
If that's the case, how can we morally hold anyone responsible for anything?

377
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,680
How can you say that a murderer is responsible for the murders that he committed if there's

378
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,240
no free will?

379
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,880
Even if we get to a point where there's no free will, it might be beneficial just to

380
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,720
keep the illusion of it around, just because society would completely break down without

381
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
it.

382
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,520
And maybe that's the point of this article.

383
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,920
In any case, it's good to be back making these again regularly.

384
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,960
Hopefully you will see a new video from me, a new full video in fact, coming up this week.

385
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,340
And if you do want to see more of me, you can always drop by my Twitch channel, twitch.tv

386
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,800
slash shortfatotaku, I usually stream there five nights a week.

387
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I'll see you there, hopefully.

388
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,840
I love you guys.
