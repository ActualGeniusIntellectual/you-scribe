00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly number 14 for the 23rd of September 2018.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.100
I almost forgot to do this one.

00:09.100 --> 00:12.520
I've been spending the whole day house cleaning.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.020
I've cleaned the recording studio, I've cleaned the office, I've cleaned the bedrooms, I've

00:16.020 --> 00:22.720
cleaned the bathrooms, the kitchen, the living room, the porch, everything, pretty much everything

00:22.720 --> 00:25.160
now, without my girlfriend.

00:25.160 --> 00:30.480
And honestly, it sounds kind of weird to say, but it feels good to have it all clean.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.680
It feels good to like sit down in a clean house.

00:32.680 --> 00:40.160
So I've decided to take a break with a delicious sweet green tea and look over some bullshit

00:40.160 --> 00:41.160
with you guys.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.160
Here, just listen to this.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.160
Oh yeah baby.

00:45.160 --> 00:53.260
Mmm, that's good stuff.

00:53.260 --> 00:58.520
So today we have, from USA Today, Donald Trump broke the presidency.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.760
It's time to get rid of the job altogether.

01:01.760 --> 01:07.260
So now we're at the point where the media is advocating for the dissolution of democracy

01:07.260 --> 01:09.460
because they still can't get their way.

01:09.460 --> 01:14.980
Donald Trump is proof that the US presidency is broken and democracy is in peril.

01:14.980 --> 01:19.100
It's time to amend the constitution and abolish the presidency.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.540
Why?

01:20.540 --> 01:28.060
I mean, you might even be able to make a decent political argument as to why the US constitution

01:28.060 --> 01:31.660
should be amended and the presidency should be replaced with like a prime ministership

01:31.660 --> 01:35.300
maybe or a different style of democratic government, something different.

01:35.300 --> 01:39.840
You could have that conversation, but this is quite literally just abolish the presidency

01:39.840 --> 01:43.720
because we keep losing and we can't compete.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.100
Abolish the POTUS.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.180
We've seen it.

01:46.180 --> 01:51.860
The belligerent typo-ridden tweets, the fawning press conferences with autocrats and overlords,

01:51.860 --> 01:57.100
the self-described Nazis on parade praising an American president's name.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.940
We've seen it with our own eyes.

01:58.940 --> 02:04.060
There is a bloated authoritarian lounging in his bathrobe in a 200 year old mansion

02:04.060 --> 02:06.620
that used to symbolize the principal republic of the world.

02:06.620 --> 02:10.380
Yeah, that's all true, at least on some level.

02:10.380 --> 02:15.540
And what makes it more interesting is that despite all of those flaws that you're attributing

02:15.540 --> 02:20.700
to Trump, you still couldn't beat him at the polls.

02:20.700 --> 02:26.060
Your preferred candidate was considered to be worse by the American people.

02:26.060 --> 02:30.820
This is a man who openly conspired to cheat with the help of a hostile foreign nation

02:30.820 --> 02:31.820
in a federal election.

02:31.820 --> 02:37.580
Yeah, they're talking about Russia here and really the left has loved Russia up until

02:37.580 --> 02:39.640
recently.

02:39.640 --> 02:46.300
On election night, he came in second place, yet due to a scab of slavery in the constitution,

02:46.300 --> 02:52.320
the electoral college, this usurper has the full power of the most powerful- I can't-

02:52.320 --> 02:56.120
okay, I can't fucking keep going.

02:56.120 --> 03:01.360
The electoral college is not a scab of slavery, the electoral college is in place to ensure

03:01.360 --> 03:08.400
that densely populated cities with their monoform culture don't get to rule over the entire

03:08.400 --> 03:12.120
nation, including the hinterlands of it.

03:12.120 --> 03:17.160
Because people in the city have no idea how people in the country live, and vice versa.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.440
So they can't simply be trusted to make decisions for the good of both.

03:22.440 --> 03:28.780
I mean, right now you have these elitist leftists who live in San Francisco and LA and New York

03:28.780 --> 03:34.780
City who think that they know best for everyone on the planet, and the truth is they don't.

03:34.820 --> 03:40.220
But they think that their ideas are how society should be set up, not knowing that if it were

03:40.220 --> 03:46.420
actually that way, it would completely destroy everyone not living in their coastal elite

03:46.420 --> 03:47.740
urban centers.

03:47.740 --> 03:54.540
And because they don't know that, they simply can't be trusted with a direct majority, which

03:54.540 --> 03:57.140
is why the electoral college exists.

03:57.140 --> 03:59.840
Here let me couch it in SJW rhetoric.

03:59.840 --> 04:06.400
The electoral college exists to provide some level of privilege to an oppressed class of

04:06.400 --> 04:10.440
people, the people who can't afford to live anywhere but the fucking sticks.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.600
This usurper has the full power of the most powerful military in history, command of the

04:14.600 --> 04:18.760
treasury, the absolute power to pardon and he can unilaterally annihilate millions of

04:18.760 --> 04:22.480
people with his command to deploy nuclear weapons.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.320
He's made refugees begging us for mercy into orphans hoping it will deter other asylum

04:26.320 --> 04:28.280
seekers, because he can.

04:28.280 --> 04:33.740
He's now poised to put a man on the supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, who believes in supreme

04:33.740 --> 04:36.100
leaders, if they're republican that is.

04:36.100 --> 04:43.400
This may be the most ridiculously skewed paragraph I have ever read on a mainstream media outlet.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.720
It's pretty incredible.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.640
Russia attacked our country.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.960
The target was Hillary Clinton and liberal democracy, and they hit their mark.

04:50.960 --> 04:56.040
Now I'm no expert on the subject, but as far as I know, Russian involvement in the American

04:56.040 --> 05:02.760
election basically amounted to uncovering Hillary Clinton's emails and showing the truth

05:02.760 --> 05:08.480
to the American population about all the terrible shit she had done, and in that case we actually

05:08.480 --> 05:19.560
owe the Russians a debt of gratitude.

05:19.560 --> 05:23.200
If you're stunned that President Donald Trump is still in office because he's so horrible

05:23.200 --> 05:26.700
and so unpopular and so obviously corrupt, you are not alone.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.760
The overwhelming majority agrees with you.

05:28.760 --> 05:34.360
Only about 25% of eligible voters voted for President grab him by the pussy, yet the majority

05:34.360 --> 05:36.080
was apparently powerless to stop him.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.320
Well if you feel that way, impeach him.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.100
Here's what you do.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.000
The 2018 elections are coming up.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.600
If you felt this way maybe a year ago, you should have fielded candidates who one, were

05:48.600 --> 05:53.080
willing to impeach Donald Trump, two, had other qualities to them that would make them

05:53.080 --> 05:59.520
electable by their various constituents, and then once they got into office in 2018,

05:59.520 --> 06:00.520
impeach Donald Trump.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.860
That's how you do it.

06:01.860 --> 06:06.840
If you actually think that you are part of the overwhelming majority, then surely you

06:06.840 --> 06:09.600
could have rustled all this up, but you haven't.

06:09.600 --> 06:16.640
All you've been doing since 2016, hell, since Brexit, is throwing a long unending tantrum.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.580
But of course, she talks about impeachment right here.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.880
Impeachment won't remove Trump from office.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.080
The remedy in our constitution for a treasonous turncoat who got into the White House in our

06:25.080 --> 06:26.880
technicality is impeachment.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.480
But guess what?

06:28.480 --> 06:31.160
Impeachment has never gotten rid of a bad president in this country.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.160
Not ever.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.780
Bill Clinton finished his term after being impeached.

06:34.780 --> 06:39.640
The threat of impeachment got Nixon to step down, but impeachment as a whole has failed.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.200
It's never lived up to its promise.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.700
Well that's the problem isn't it?

06:42.700 --> 06:47.320
Because Bill Clinton wasn't a treasonous turncoat.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.920
He lied about an affair he had.

06:50.920 --> 06:55.200
That's basically it, and you're not going to get someone kicked out of the White House

06:55.200 --> 06:57.240
for having an affair.

06:57.240 --> 07:03.400
If Trump is as bad as you say, and you are the majority the way that you say you are,

07:03.400 --> 07:07.200
you should be able to impeach him, and that should lead to him getting kicked out of the

07:07.200 --> 07:08.480
White House.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.080
However, he's not, and you can't.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.640
Abolish presidency to save democracy.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.280
We can make that happen.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.040
My fear isn't Trump.

07:18.040 --> 07:23.160
It's that the next autocrat is most likely smarter and savvier than Trump.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.320
Every partisan from every niche of American politics should be alarmed.

07:26.320 --> 07:31.240
We have a branch of government that stinks so bad it's wafted over the entire nation

07:31.240 --> 07:32.960
and its outer territories.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.480
The entire world sees it.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.520
We're in trouble.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.240
The presidency is broken.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.920
Our little democratic experiment is in peril.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.000
To be honest, it would be worse under Hillary.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.120
And it would be worse under Hillary.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.500
Trump is, he's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.720
He's actually probably not that good of a president, but he is the president that the

07:54.720 --> 07:57.700
United States needed at this point in time.

07:57.700 --> 08:00.160
And all of this whining because you lost.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.920
I mean, let's be honest here.

08:01.920 --> 08:06.020
This article would not have been written if Hillary won the presidency, even though she

08:06.020 --> 08:09.920
would have been objectively worse than Trump.

08:09.920 --> 08:14.360
We can amend our constitution to save the republic, abolish the presidency, power to

08:14.360 --> 08:19.640
the people, power to the Congress, make the co-equal branches of government more equal.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.500
Give us a council of boring bureaucrats who will do their jobs, serve the people and leave

08:23.500 --> 08:25.240
after their term ends.

08:25.240 --> 08:28.720
Well, frankly, that is what Congress should be.

08:28.720 --> 08:33.240
And as I recall, Trump ran on making Congress have term limits.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.960
Now, who knows if he'll ever actually get that done.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.240
In fact, he probably won't get that done.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.920
Maybe he'll get it done on a second term because by then he really won't give a shit.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.520
Just like Obama didn't give a shit on a second term.

08:44.520 --> 08:51.360
But your complaint here seems to be that Congress doesn't have term limits.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.680
And Trump, well, Trump agrees with you on that one.

08:54.680 --> 08:59.080
Considering that the author of this article sounds like a fucking snowflake, let's move

08:59.080 --> 09:05.760
on to the next one titled Don't Call Us Snowflakes, It Damages Our Mental Health, Say Young People.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.240
This is quite the image.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.080
This is an incredible image.

09:09.080 --> 09:13.560
Being called a snowflake is damaging to mental health, young people say.

09:13.560 --> 09:18.220
Figures show, which figures are we talking about here, that the majority of young people

09:18.220 --> 09:23.000
think the term is unfair and even more think it could have a negative effect on its own.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.120
Well, maybe you shouldn't be fucking snowflakes then.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.120
Holy fuck.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.120
Okay.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.680
Can you imagine if this were flipped on its head?

09:30.680 --> 09:36.280
Imagine if a bunch of young conservatives or alt-right people came out and said, don't

09:36.280 --> 09:38.360
call us Nazis.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.680
It's damaging to our mental health.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.080
Whether or not they were actually Nazis, let's just put that aside for a minute.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.280
They're just saying, don't call us Nazis.

09:48.280 --> 09:53.720
They would be universally shat on by everyone.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.120
The honest truth is, not only can you not choose your pronoun, well, I mean, you can

09:58.120 --> 09:59.120
to an extent.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
You can be polite about it.

10:00.120 --> 10:05.600
Like if you're a trans person who gets misgendered, you can politely ask that somebody call you

10:05.600 --> 10:07.240
by a different set of pronouns.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.520
If they don't listen to you, they're being a dick, but it's their choice, right?

10:12.520 --> 10:17.440
But not only can you not choose your pronoun really, you can't choose your adjective.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.280
And this snowflake business is kind of an extension of the choosing your pronouns stuff

10:21.280 --> 10:28.600
because basically what it boils down to is people saying, hey, I get to control what

10:28.600 --> 10:34.640
you say about me because what you say about me might be damaging to me.

10:34.640 --> 10:39.440
So if you misgender me, I should have some kind of power over you to make you stop doing

10:39.440 --> 10:40.440
that.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.320
And if you can do it for pronouns, why can't you do it for adjectives?

10:43.320 --> 10:45.040
It's the same logic, right?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.040
Don't call me a snowflake.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.720
It makes me feel bad.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.120
It's damaging me.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.280
So therefore you must be controlled.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.660
Then we can take it further.

10:53.660 --> 10:54.960
Don't call me an idiot.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.360
Don't call me stupid.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.600
Don't call me dumb.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.120
Don't call me slow.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.960
Don't call me anything that I don't want you to call me.

11:01.960 --> 11:08.560
That's the end result of this political correctness bullshit is this snowflake stupidity here.

11:08.560 --> 11:13.600
The snowflake generation is a disparaging term now commonly used to refer to young people

11:13.600 --> 11:17.400
who are perceived to be oversensitive and intolerant of disagreement.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.080
Well that's because they are.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.000
They can't tolerate any kind of disagreement.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.120
Whenever there's a speaker at a university they don't like, they'll pull the fire alarm.

11:28.120 --> 11:32.040
They'll attack people wearing black masks over disagreements.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.240
It's ridiculous bullshit.

11:34.240 --> 11:40.560
Research by insurance firm Aviva found that 72% of 16 to 24 year olds think the term is

11:40.560 --> 11:46.000
unfairly applied, while 74% think it could have a negative effect on young people's mental

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
health.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.760
Well of course they're pulling this card because it's how they've controlled the conversation

11:49.760 --> 11:50.880
so far.

11:50.880 --> 11:55.320
If you're somebody who is willing to use violence to accomplish your political objectives, and

11:55.320 --> 12:01.440
then somebody calls you violent knowing that to be perceived to be violent by the public

12:01.440 --> 12:06.480
at large is a negative thing, they're now going to want to control your speech and say

12:06.480 --> 12:08.320
don't call me violent.

12:08.320 --> 12:13.040
Even though you objectively are violent, that person is going to say don't call me violent

12:13.040 --> 12:14.320
because it looks bad.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.320
And that's what this is.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.640
It's not quite the same thing.

12:16.640 --> 12:21.560
We're talking about snowflakes, not violence, but it's a related idea.

12:21.560 --> 12:26.040
These people know that they are intolerant of debates.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.320
These people know that they're intolerant of different types of ideas.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.160
They do it in the name of battling oppression or whatever.

12:33.160 --> 12:38.680
And they know that the public perception of them is that they're basically sissies.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.680
Is that they can't handle anything outside of their bubble.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.200
So they're called snowflakes and they don't like that.

12:44.200 --> 12:48.280
The figures also show that young people are more likely to have experienced stress, anxiety

12:48.280 --> 12:50.080
and depression in the last year.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.440
Get off Tumblr.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.240
I'm sure some of this is real.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.400
Some people have some terrible situations they're going through.

12:56.400 --> 13:03.720
But you live in the most privileged society in the most privileged time on earth.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.160
Get off Tumblr.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.000
Recognize the opportunities you have laid out in front of you.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.800
And get to work.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.640
That's why you have stress, you have anxiety and you're depressed.

13:13.640 --> 13:17.960
The phrase which originated in America has particularly come to refer to universities

13:17.960 --> 13:22.480
and students who use trigger warnings to alert readers or listeners to potentially

13:22.480 --> 13:27.600
distressing material and safe spaces which are meant to be free of certain opinions or

13:27.600 --> 13:29.040
ideas.

13:29.040 --> 13:32.160
You said it right there.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.920
The safe space is meant to be free of opinions and ideas.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.160
Now what is it that a snowflake was described as?

13:39.160 --> 13:43.400
Let me just find it up here.

13:43.400 --> 13:49.320
Snowflake generation perceived to be oversensitive and intolerant of disagreement.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.280
What is a safe space for snowflakes?

13:51.280 --> 13:55.500
Oh, a place where there's no contrary opinions and ideas.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.000
Maybe in that place there will be no disagreement.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.560
It is also used to imply that young people are less resilient than older generations

14:03.560 --> 14:04.560
and quicker to take offense.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.360
Well, that is generally true, isn't it?

14:06.360 --> 14:09.680
I mean, young people have had a lot less experience with the world.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.960
It's not just in terms of being resilient or quicker to take offense, it's also in

14:12.960 --> 14:21.640
terms of, you know, physical strength, experience, capability of dealing with loss, emotional

14:21.640 --> 14:27.120
maturity, physical maturity, job experience, wisdom, like there's a whole bunch of things

14:27.120 --> 14:28.780
that age brings with it, man.

14:28.780 --> 14:33.720
And that's just how it is, I mean, maybe you feel discriminated against by time, but

14:33.720 --> 14:35.400
good luck winning that battle.

14:35.400 --> 14:41.480
It is thought to originate with U.S. author Chuck Pahalanuck's 1996 book Fight Club,

14:41.480 --> 14:47.960
which contains the line, you are not special, you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.280
And he's, he's right.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.360
I mean, being special, there's, there's, I don't know, that's been another video idea

14:54.360 --> 14:59.160
that I've been rattling around in my head is snowflakes and being special because there's

14:59.160 --> 15:06.320
more to it than just you are not special because in as many ways as you're not special, you

15:06.320 --> 15:08.000
are also special.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.400
However, it's important to recognize which ways you're special, which ways you're not,

15:13.400 --> 15:17.080
and not simply assume things are the way that you want them to be.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.080
It's a very complicated topic.

15:18.080 --> 15:23.080
Maybe I'll talk about it some other time, but let's move on to the guardians, the myth

15:23.080 --> 15:28.120
of freedom.

15:28.120 --> 15:33.240
Governments and corporations will soon know you better than you know yourself.

15:33.240 --> 15:38.160
belief in the idea of free will has become dangerous.

15:38.160 --> 15:44.280
We are now at the point where humanity needs to be stripped of free will according to the

15:44.280 --> 15:45.380
far left.

15:45.380 --> 15:50.560
Should scholars serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony?

15:50.560 --> 15:52.920
Yes.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.800
Okay.

15:55.800 --> 16:02.360
You you're already starting the article with, I think the worst thing I've, I've read in

16:02.360 --> 16:04.000
a long fucking time.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Yes.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.300
They should serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.880
How is that even a question?

16:11.880 --> 16:16.480
Should you expose a fiction even if that fiction sustains the social order?

16:16.480 --> 16:21.320
In writing my latest book, 21 lessons for the 21st century, I had to struggle with this

16:21.320 --> 16:23.520
dilemma with regard to liberalism.

16:23.520 --> 16:28.000
On the one hand, I believe that the liberal story is flawed, that it does not tell the

16:28.000 --> 16:32.160
truth about humanity, and that in order to survive and flourish in the 21st century,

16:32.160 --> 16:33.760
we need to go beyond it.

16:33.760 --> 16:40.880
Well, the problem is, one, I don't know what type of liberal this person is talking about.

16:40.880 --> 16:46.720
Oftentimes when people say liberal nowadays, they mean left, and liberalism is not an idea

16:46.720 --> 16:49.860
that is specifically tied to the left.

16:49.860 --> 16:55.080
The left's progressive wings and Marxist wings are very anti-liberal, right?

16:55.080 --> 17:01.600
However, if we're talking about liberalism, actual liberalism, you know, valuing free

17:01.600 --> 17:07.920
will, which apparently this author does not, but valuing free will, valuing choice, valuing

17:07.920 --> 17:12.880
equality of opportunity, valuing an open market, you know?

17:12.880 --> 17:17.680
With a social safety net, yes, but an open market, these things are liberalism.

17:17.680 --> 17:25.360
And if she's talking about this type of liberalism, there's no going beyond that.

17:25.360 --> 17:30.560
That is basically the political apex, in my opinion, that humanity is ever going to reach.

17:30.560 --> 17:36.800
I mean, maybe not, maybe we'll find something different that's more amazing, but belief

17:36.800 --> 17:43.680
in the supremacy of the individual is why we had the industrial revolution, why we had

17:43.680 --> 17:50.080
the computer revolution, why we had any form of human rights movements, why we have a reasonable

17:50.080 --> 17:56.640
amount of environmentalism in society, why we have any of the things that make our society

17:56.640 --> 17:59.700
the greatest society to ever exist.

17:59.700 --> 18:05.280
That's because of liberalism, that's because of the value of the individual.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.860
This person doesn't fucking understand what they're talking about.

18:07.860 --> 18:13.600
What's more, liberalism is now attacked by religious and nationalist fanatics who believe

18:13.600 --> 18:17.980
in nostalgic fantasies that are far more dangerous and harmful.

18:17.980 --> 18:22.580
Now that describes Islam, but because this is the Guardian, I have to assume they're

18:22.580 --> 18:24.900
not talking about Islam.

18:24.900 --> 18:29.800
liberalism's great advantage over other ideologies is that it is flexible and undogmatic.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.300
It can sustain criticism better than any other social order.

18:33.300 --> 18:39.700
Indeed, it is the only social order that allows people to question even its own foundations.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.780
Liberalism has already survived three big crises, the first world war, the fascist challenge

18:43.780 --> 18:48.020
in the 1930s, and the communist challenge in the 1950s to 70s.

18:48.020 --> 18:51.940
If you think liberalism is in trouble now, just remember how much worse things were in

18:51.940 --> 18:54.700
1918, 1938, or 1968.

18:54.700 --> 18:59.420
See, so far this person seems to basically be on the money, but then we kinda get into

18:59.420 --> 19:01.760
some weird territory here.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.060
Liberalism is founded on the belief in human liberty.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.540
Unlike rats and monkeys, human beings are supposed to have free will.

19:07.540 --> 19:11.760
This is what makes human feelings and human choices the ultimate moral and political authority

19:11.760 --> 19:13.420
in the world.

19:13.420 --> 19:17.500
Liberalism tells us that the voter knows best, that the customer is always right, and that

19:17.500 --> 19:20.580
we should think for ourselves and follow our hearts.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.220
Unfortunately, free will isn't a scientific reality.

19:23.220 --> 19:27.340
It is a myth inherited from Christian theology.

19:27.340 --> 19:31.540
Theologians developed the idea of free will to explain why God is right to punish sinners

19:31.540 --> 19:35.460
for their bad choices and reward saints for their good choices.

19:35.460 --> 19:39.940
If our choices aren't made freely, why should God punish or reward us for them?

19:39.940 --> 19:44.100
According to theologians, it is reasonable for God to do so because our choices reflect

19:44.100 --> 19:48.500
the free will of our eternal souls, which are independent of all physical and biological

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
constraints.

19:49.500 --> 19:54.260
This myth has little to do with what science now teaches us about homo sapiens and other

19:54.260 --> 19:55.260
animals.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.460
Humans certainly have a will, but it isn't free.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.820
You cannot decide what desires you have.

19:59.820 --> 20:05.140
You don't decide to be introverted or extroverted, easygoing or anxious, gay or straight.

20:05.140 --> 20:08.780
Humans make choices, but they are never independent choices.

20:08.780 --> 20:12.780
If every choice depends on a lot of biological, social, and personal conditions that you cannot

20:12.780 --> 20:17.860
determine for yourself, I can choose what to eat, whom to marry, and whom to vote for,

20:17.860 --> 20:21.820
but these choices are determined in part by my genes, my biochemistry, my gender, my

20:21.820 --> 20:24.340
family background, my national culture, etc.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.780
I didn't choose which genes or family to have.

20:26.780 --> 20:32.040
The problem with this point of view is that it's conflating circumstances with choices

20:32.040 --> 20:33.700
and they're not the same thing.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.140
What's a good example?

20:35.140 --> 20:36.420
Boogie is a good example.

20:36.420 --> 20:45.100
Boogie was like a 600 pound goliath of a man, like grotesquely fat, okay?

20:45.100 --> 20:51.060
But he has made the choice to make some lifestyle changes, and there was definitely some surgery

20:51.060 --> 20:54.960
along with that, but he made choices.

20:54.960 --> 21:00.100
In fact, the choice to get the surgery was a choice too, and as a result of those choices,

21:00.100 --> 21:01.100
he's losing weight.

21:01.100 --> 21:05.500
He's significantly thinner than he was before.

21:05.500 --> 21:10.900
Circumstances are not choices, and they can influence choices, but people always have

21:10.900 --> 21:15.260
the ability to choose beyond their circumstances.

21:15.260 --> 21:20.500
A fat person who has been fat their whole life, who chooses beyond their circumstances

21:20.500 --> 21:23.320
to become thin, that's free will.

21:23.320 --> 21:28.600
An alcoholic who has been drinking for 20 years, who makes the choice to stop, that's

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
free will.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.660
It's not easy, no one's saying that it's easy, but the choice is still there.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.300
This is not an abstract theory.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.500
You can witness this easily.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.900
Just observe the next thought that pops up in your mind.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.040
Where did it come from?

21:40.040 --> 21:42.120
Did you freely choose to think it?

21:42.120 --> 21:43.120
Obviously not.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.960
If you carefully observe your own mind, you come to realize that you have little control

21:46.960 --> 21:50.880
of what's going on there, and that you are not choosing freely what to think, what to

21:50.880 --> 21:53.380
feel, and what to want.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.380
That's partially true.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.960
However, that does not disprove free will, does it?

21:57.960 --> 22:02.920
I mean, yeah, there's obviously some kind of unconscious part of your mind that you

22:02.920 --> 22:05.840
do not have any kind of free will over.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.280
You're going to get stray thoughts, you're going to get dreams, you're going to get all

22:09.280 --> 22:13.880
these situations, and yet you can still choose what you do with them.

22:13.880 --> 22:18.520
You can get some kind of thought in your mind, you can choose to ignore it, you can choose

22:18.520 --> 22:23.300
to act on it, you can choose to ruminate on it but not actually perform any action.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.640
You can do a lot of things.

22:25.640 --> 22:31.760
Just because there are some uncontrollable parts of yourself doesn't mean that you are,

22:31.760 --> 22:34.480
on the whole, uncontrollable.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.540
There's a lot of thought experiments in this article, it's probably actually worth reading,

22:37.540 --> 22:39.460
but let's get down to the end of it here.

22:39.460 --> 22:43.920
If humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don't reflect our free

22:43.920 --> 22:48.540
will, what should the point of politics be?

22:48.540 --> 22:50.780
That's actually a very good question.

22:50.780 --> 22:57.300
However, I'm not sure that those ifs that you started with, those presuppositions, are

22:57.300 --> 22:58.300
actually true.

22:58.300 --> 23:03.500
But I think there's a far worse problem here than even just politics.

23:03.500 --> 23:10.380
If free will really is gone, let's say that it just turns out that undeniably, unrefutably,

23:10.380 --> 23:12.240
there is zero free will.

23:12.240 --> 23:17.500
Not all free will, not partial free will and partial uncontrollability.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
Zero free will.

23:18.500 --> 23:23.940
If that's the case, how can we morally hold anyone responsible for anything?

23:23.940 --> 23:29.680
How can you say that a murderer is responsible for the murders that he committed if there's

23:29.680 --> 23:33.240
no free will?

23:33.240 --> 23:36.880
Even if we get to a point where there's no free will, it might be beneficial just to

23:36.880 --> 23:42.720
keep the illusion of it around, just because society would completely break down without

23:42.720 --> 23:43.720
it.

23:43.720 --> 23:46.520
And maybe that's the point of this article.

23:46.520 --> 23:50.920
In any case, it's good to be back making these again regularly.

23:50.920 --> 23:56.960
Hopefully you will see a new video from me, a new full video in fact, coming up this week.

23:56.960 --> 24:03.340
And if you do want to see more of me, you can always drop by my Twitch channel, twitch.tv

24:03.340 --> 24:06.800
slash shortfatotaku, I usually stream there five nights a week.

24:06.800 --> 24:07.800
I'll see you there, hopefully.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.840
I love you guys.
