0	7400	Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly number 14 for the 23rd of September 2018.
7400	9100	I almost forgot to do this one.
9100	12520	I've been spending the whole day house cleaning.
12520	16020	I've cleaned the recording studio, I've cleaned the office, I've cleaned the bedrooms, I've
16020	22720	cleaned the bathrooms, the kitchen, the living room, the porch, everything, pretty much everything
22720	25160	now, without my girlfriend.
25160	30480	And honestly, it sounds kind of weird to say, but it feels good to have it all clean.
30480	32680	It feels good to like sit down in a clean house.
32680	40160	So I've decided to take a break with a delicious sweet green tea and look over some bullshit
40160	41160	with you guys.
41160	42160	Here, just listen to this.
42160	45160	Oh yeah baby.
45160	53260	Mmm, that's good stuff.
53260	58520	So today we have, from USA Today, Donald Trump broke the presidency.
58520	61760	It's time to get rid of the job altogether.
61760	67260	So now we're at the point where the media is advocating for the dissolution of democracy
67260	69460	because they still can't get their way.
69460	74980	Donald Trump is proof that the US presidency is broken and democracy is in peril.
74980	79100	It's time to amend the constitution and abolish the presidency.
79100	80540	Why?
80540	88060	I mean, you might even be able to make a decent political argument as to why the US constitution
88060	91660	should be amended and the presidency should be replaced with like a prime ministership
91660	95300	maybe or a different style of democratic government, something different.
95300	99840	You could have that conversation, but this is quite literally just abolish the presidency
99840	103720	because we keep losing and we can't compete.
103720	105100	Abolish the POTUS.
105100	106180	We've seen it.
106180	111860	The belligerent typo-ridden tweets, the fawning press conferences with autocrats and overlords,
111860	117100	the self-described Nazis on parade praising an American president's name.
117100	118940	We've seen it with our own eyes.
118940	124060	There is a bloated authoritarian lounging in his bathrobe in a 200 year old mansion
124060	126620	that used to symbolize the principal republic of the world.
126620	130380	Yeah, that's all true, at least on some level.
130380	135540	And what makes it more interesting is that despite all of those flaws that you're attributing
135540	140700	to Trump, you still couldn't beat him at the polls.
140700	146060	Your preferred candidate was considered to be worse by the American people.
146060	150820	This is a man who openly conspired to cheat with the help of a hostile foreign nation
150820	151820	in a federal election.
151820	157580	Yeah, they're talking about Russia here and really the left has loved Russia up until
157580	159640	recently.
159640	166300	On election night, he came in second place, yet due to a scab of slavery in the constitution,
166300	172320	the electoral college, this usurper has the full power of the most powerful- I can't-
172320	176120	okay, I can't fucking keep going.
176120	181360	The electoral college is not a scab of slavery, the electoral college is in place to ensure
181360	188400	that densely populated cities with their monoform culture don't get to rule over the entire
188400	192120	nation, including the hinterlands of it.
192120	197160	Because people in the city have no idea how people in the country live, and vice versa.
197160	202440	So they can't simply be trusted to make decisions for the good of both.
202440	208780	I mean, right now you have these elitist leftists who live in San Francisco and LA and New York
208780	214780	City who think that they know best for everyone on the planet, and the truth is they don't.
214820	220220	But they think that their ideas are how society should be set up, not knowing that if it were
220220	226420	actually that way, it would completely destroy everyone not living in their coastal elite
226420	227740	urban centers.
227740	234540	And because they don't know that, they simply can't be trusted with a direct majority, which
234540	237140	is why the electoral college exists.
237140	239840	Here let me couch it in SJW rhetoric.
239840	246400	The electoral college exists to provide some level of privilege to an oppressed class of
246400	250440	people, the people who can't afford to live anywhere but the fucking sticks.
250440	254600	This usurper has the full power of the most powerful military in history, command of the
254600	258760	treasury, the absolute power to pardon and he can unilaterally annihilate millions of
258760	262480	people with his command to deploy nuclear weapons.
262480	266320	He's made refugees begging us for mercy into orphans hoping it will deter other asylum
266320	268280	seekers, because he can.
268280	273740	He's now poised to put a man on the supreme court, Brett Kavanaugh, who believes in supreme
273740	276100	leaders, if they're republican that is.
276100	283400	This may be the most ridiculously skewed paragraph I have ever read on a mainstream media outlet.
283400	284720	It's pretty incredible.
284720	286640	Russia attacked our country.
286640	290960	The target was Hillary Clinton and liberal democracy, and they hit their mark.
290960	296040	Now I'm no expert on the subject, but as far as I know, Russian involvement in the American
296040	302760	election basically amounted to uncovering Hillary Clinton's emails and showing the truth
302760	308480	to the American population about all the terrible shit she had done, and in that case we actually
308480	319560	owe the Russians a debt of gratitude.
319560	323200	If you're stunned that President Donald Trump is still in office because he's so horrible
323200	326700	and so unpopular and so obviously corrupt, you are not alone.
326700	328760	The overwhelming majority agrees with you.
328760	334360	Only about 25% of eligible voters voted for President grab him by the pussy, yet the majority
334360	336080	was apparently powerless to stop him.
336080	338320	Well if you feel that way, impeach him.
338320	340100	Here's what you do.
340100	342000	The 2018 elections are coming up.
342000	348600	If you felt this way maybe a year ago, you should have fielded candidates who one, were
348600	353080	willing to impeach Donald Trump, two, had other qualities to them that would make them
353080	359520	electable by their various constituents, and then once they got into office in 2018,
359520	360520	impeach Donald Trump.
360520	361860	That's how you do it.
361860	366840	If you actually think that you are part of the overwhelming majority, then surely you
366840	369600	could have rustled all this up, but you haven't.
369600	376640	All you've been doing since 2016, hell, since Brexit, is throwing a long unending tantrum.
376640	379580	But of course, she talks about impeachment right here.
379580	381880	Impeachment won't remove Trump from office.
381880	385080	The remedy in our constitution for a treasonous turncoat who got into the White House in our
385080	386880	technicality is impeachment.
386880	388480	But guess what?
388480	391160	Impeachment has never gotten rid of a bad president in this country.
391160	392160	Not ever.
392160	394780	Bill Clinton finished his term after being impeached.
394780	399640	The threat of impeachment got Nixon to step down, but impeachment as a whole has failed.
399640	401200	It's never lived up to its promise.
401200	402700	Well that's the problem isn't it?
402700	407320	Because Bill Clinton wasn't a treasonous turncoat.
407320	410920	He lied about an affair he had.
410920	415200	That's basically it, and you're not going to get someone kicked out of the White House
415200	417240	for having an affair.
417240	423400	If Trump is as bad as you say, and you are the majority the way that you say you are,
423400	427200	you should be able to impeach him, and that should lead to him getting kicked out of the
427200	428480	White House.
428480	432080	However, he's not, and you can't.
432080	434640	Abolish presidency to save democracy.
434640	436280	We can make that happen.
436280	438040	My fear isn't Trump.
438040	443160	It's that the next autocrat is most likely smarter and savvier than Trump.
443160	446320	Every partisan from every niche of American politics should be alarmed.
446320	451240	We have a branch of government that stinks so bad it's wafted over the entire nation
451240	452960	and its outer territories.
452960	454480	The entire world sees it.
454480	455520	We're in trouble.
455520	457240	The presidency is broken.
457240	460920	Our little democratic experiment is in peril.
460920	464000	To be honest, it would be worse under Hillary.
464000	466120	And it would be worse under Hillary.
466120	469500	Trump is, he's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.
469500	474720	He's actually probably not that good of a president, but he is the president that the
474720	477700	United States needed at this point in time.
477700	480160	And all of this whining because you lost.
480160	481920	I mean, let's be honest here.
481920	486020	This article would not have been written if Hillary won the presidency, even though she
486020	489920	would have been objectively worse than Trump.
489920	494360	We can amend our constitution to save the republic, abolish the presidency, power to
494360	499640	the people, power to the Congress, make the co-equal branches of government more equal.
499640	503500	Give us a council of boring bureaucrats who will do their jobs, serve the people and leave
503500	505240	after their term ends.
505240	508720	Well, frankly, that is what Congress should be.
508720	513240	And as I recall, Trump ran on making Congress have term limits.
513240	515960	Now, who knows if he'll ever actually get that done.
515960	518240	In fact, he probably won't get that done.
518240	521920	Maybe he'll get it done on a second term because by then he really won't give a shit.
521920	524520	Just like Obama didn't give a shit on a second term.
524520	531360	But your complaint here seems to be that Congress doesn't have term limits.
531360	534680	And Trump, well, Trump agrees with you on that one.
534680	539080	Considering that the author of this article sounds like a fucking snowflake, let's move
539080	545760	on to the next one titled Don't Call Us Snowflakes, It Damages Our Mental Health, Say Young People.
545760	547240	This is quite the image.
547240	549080	This is an incredible image.
549080	553560	Being called a snowflake is damaging to mental health, young people say.
553560	558220	Figures show, which figures are we talking about here, that the majority of young people
558220	563000	think the term is unfair and even more think it could have a negative effect on its own.
563000	567120	Well, maybe you shouldn't be fucking snowflakes then.
567120	568120	Holy fuck.
568120	569120	Okay.
569120	570680	Can you imagine if this were flipped on its head?
570680	576280	Imagine if a bunch of young conservatives or alt-right people came out and said, don't
576280	578360	call us Nazis.
578360	580680	It's damaging to our mental health.
580680	584080	Whether or not they were actually Nazis, let's just put that aside for a minute.
584080	588280	They're just saying, don't call us Nazis.
588280	593720	They would be universally shat on by everyone.
593720	598120	The honest truth is, not only can you not choose your pronoun, well, I mean, you can
598120	599120	to an extent.
599120	600120	You can be polite about it.
600120	605600	Like if you're a trans person who gets misgendered, you can politely ask that somebody call you
605600	607240	by a different set of pronouns.
607840	612520	If they don't listen to you, they're being a dick, but it's their choice, right?
612520	617440	But not only can you not choose your pronoun really, you can't choose your adjective.
617440	621280	And this snowflake business is kind of an extension of the choosing your pronouns stuff
621280	628600	because basically what it boils down to is people saying, hey, I get to control what
628600	634640	you say about me because what you say about me might be damaging to me.
634640	639440	So if you misgender me, I should have some kind of power over you to make you stop doing
639440	640440	that.
640440	643320	And if you can do it for pronouns, why can't you do it for adjectives?
643320	645040	It's the same logic, right?
645040	646040	Don't call me a snowflake.
646040	647720	It makes me feel bad.
647720	649120	It's damaging me.
649120	652280	So therefore you must be controlled.
652280	653660	Then we can take it further.
653660	654960	Don't call me an idiot.
654960	656360	Don't call me stupid.
656360	657600	Don't call me dumb.
657600	659120	Don't call me slow.
659120	661960	Don't call me anything that I don't want you to call me.
661960	668560	That's the end result of this political correctness bullshit is this snowflake stupidity here.
668560	673600	The snowflake generation is a disparaging term now commonly used to refer to young people
673600	677400	who are perceived to be oversensitive and intolerant of disagreement.
677400	680080	Well that's because they are.
680080	683000	They can't tolerate any kind of disagreement.
683000	688120	Whenever there's a speaker at a university they don't like, they'll pull the fire alarm.
688120	692040	They'll attack people wearing black masks over disagreements.
692040	694240	It's ridiculous bullshit.
694240	700560	Research by insurance firm Aviva found that 72% of 16 to 24 year olds think the term is
700560	706000	unfairly applied, while 74% think it could have a negative effect on young people's mental
706000	707000	health.
707000	709760	Well of course they're pulling this card because it's how they've controlled the conversation
709760	710880	so far.
710880	715320	If you're somebody who is willing to use violence to accomplish your political objectives, and
715320	721440	then somebody calls you violent knowing that to be perceived to be violent by the public
721440	726480	at large is a negative thing, they're now going to want to control your speech and say
726480	728320	don't call me violent.
728320	733040	Even though you objectively are violent, that person is going to say don't call me violent
733040	734320	because it looks bad.
734320	735320	And that's what this is.
735320	736640	It's not quite the same thing.
736640	741560	We're talking about snowflakes, not violence, but it's a related idea.
741560	746040	These people know that they are intolerant of debates.
746040	749320	These people know that they're intolerant of different types of ideas.
749320	753160	They do it in the name of battling oppression or whatever.
753160	758680	And they know that the public perception of them is that they're basically sissies.
758680	761680	Is that they can't handle anything outside of their bubble.
761680	764200	So they're called snowflakes and they don't like that.
764200	768280	The figures also show that young people are more likely to have experienced stress, anxiety
768280	770080	and depression in the last year.
770080	771440	Get off Tumblr.
771440	773240	I'm sure some of this is real.
773240	776400	Some people have some terrible situations they're going through.
776400	783720	But you live in the most privileged society in the most privileged time on earth.
783720	785160	Get off Tumblr.
785160	788000	Recognize the opportunities you have laid out in front of you.
788000	789800	And get to work.
789800	793640	That's why you have stress, you have anxiety and you're depressed.
793640	797960	The phrase which originated in America has particularly come to refer to universities
797960	802480	and students who use trigger warnings to alert readers or listeners to potentially
802480	807600	distressing material and safe spaces which are meant to be free of certain opinions or
807600	809040	ideas.
809040	812160	You said it right there.
812160	815920	The safe space is meant to be free of opinions and ideas.
815920	819160	Now what is it that a snowflake was described as?
819160	823400	Let me just find it up here.
823400	829320	Snowflake generation perceived to be oversensitive and intolerant of disagreement.
829320	831280	What is a safe space for snowflakes?
831280	835500	Oh, a place where there's no contrary opinions and ideas.
835500	838000	Maybe in that place there will be no disagreement.
838000	843560	It is also used to imply that young people are less resilient than older generations
843560	844560	and quicker to take offense.
844560	846360	Well, that is generally true, isn't it?
846360	849680	I mean, young people have had a lot less experience with the world.
849680	852960	It's not just in terms of being resilient or quicker to take offense, it's also in
852960	861640	terms of, you know, physical strength, experience, capability of dealing with loss, emotional
861640	867120	maturity, physical maturity, job experience, wisdom, like there's a whole bunch of things
867120	868780	that age brings with it, man.
868780	873720	And that's just how it is, I mean, maybe you feel discriminated against by time, but
873720	875400	good luck winning that battle.
875400	881480	It is thought to originate with U.S. author Chuck Pahalanuck's 1996 book Fight Club,
881480	887960	which contains the line, you are not special, you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.
887960	890280	And he's, he's right.
890280	894360	I mean, being special, there's, there's, I don't know, that's been another video idea
894360	899160	that I've been rattling around in my head is snowflakes and being special because there's
899160	906320	more to it than just you are not special because in as many ways as you're not special, you
906320	908000	are also special.
908000	913400	However, it's important to recognize which ways you're special, which ways you're not,
913400	917080	and not simply assume things are the way that you want them to be.
917080	918080	It's a very complicated topic.
918080	923080	Maybe I'll talk about it some other time, but let's move on to the guardians, the myth
923080	928120	of freedom.
928120	933240	Governments and corporations will soon know you better than you know yourself.
933240	938160	belief in the idea of free will has become dangerous.
938160	944280	We are now at the point where humanity needs to be stripped of free will according to the
944280	945380	far left.
945380	950560	Should scholars serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony?
950560	952920	Yes.
952920	955800	Okay.
955800	962360	You you're already starting the article with, I think the worst thing I've, I've read in
962360	964000	a long fucking time.
964000	965000	Yes.
965000	970300	They should serve the truth, even at the cost of social harmony.
970300	971880	How is that even a question?
971880	976480	Should you expose a fiction even if that fiction sustains the social order?
976480	981320	In writing my latest book, 21 lessons for the 21st century, I had to struggle with this
981320	983520	dilemma with regard to liberalism.
983520	988000	On the one hand, I believe that the liberal story is flawed, that it does not tell the
988000	992160	truth about humanity, and that in order to survive and flourish in the 21st century,
992160	993760	we need to go beyond it.
993760	1000880	Well, the problem is, one, I don't know what type of liberal this person is talking about.
1000880	1006720	Oftentimes when people say liberal nowadays, they mean left, and liberalism is not an idea
1006720	1009860	that is specifically tied to the left.
1009860	1015080	The left's progressive wings and Marxist wings are very anti-liberal, right?
1015080	1021600	However, if we're talking about liberalism, actual liberalism, you know, valuing free
1021600	1027920	will, which apparently this author does not, but valuing free will, valuing choice, valuing
1027920	1032880	equality of opportunity, valuing an open market, you know?
1032880	1037680	With a social safety net, yes, but an open market, these things are liberalism.
1037680	1045360	And if she's talking about this type of liberalism, there's no going beyond that.
1045360	1050560	That is basically the political apex, in my opinion, that humanity is ever going to reach.
1050560	1056800	I mean, maybe not, maybe we'll find something different that's more amazing, but belief
1056800	1063680	in the supremacy of the individual is why we had the industrial revolution, why we had
1063680	1070080	the computer revolution, why we had any form of human rights movements, why we have a reasonable
1070080	1076640	amount of environmentalism in society, why we have any of the things that make our society
1076640	1079700	the greatest society to ever exist.
1079700	1085280	That's because of liberalism, that's because of the value of the individual.
1085280	1087860	This person doesn't fucking understand what they're talking about.
1087860	1093600	What's more, liberalism is now attacked by religious and nationalist fanatics who believe
1093600	1097980	in nostalgic fantasies that are far more dangerous and harmful.
1097980	1102580	Now that describes Islam, but because this is the Guardian, I have to assume they're
1102580	1104900	not talking about Islam.
1104900	1109800	liberalism's great advantage over other ideologies is that it is flexible and undogmatic.
1109800	1113300	It can sustain criticism better than any other social order.
1113300	1119700	Indeed, it is the only social order that allows people to question even its own foundations.
1119700	1123780	Liberalism has already survived three big crises, the first world war, the fascist challenge
1123780	1128020	in the 1930s, and the communist challenge in the 1950s to 70s.
1128020	1131940	If you think liberalism is in trouble now, just remember how much worse things were in
1131940	1134700	1918, 1938, or 1968.
1134700	1139420	See, so far this person seems to basically be on the money, but then we kinda get into
1139420	1141760	some weird territory here.
1141760	1144060	Liberalism is founded on the belief in human liberty.
1144060	1147540	Unlike rats and monkeys, human beings are supposed to have free will.
1147540	1151760	This is what makes human feelings and human choices the ultimate moral and political authority
1151760	1153420	in the world.
1153420	1157500	Liberalism tells us that the voter knows best, that the customer is always right, and that
1157500	1160580	we should think for ourselves and follow our hearts.
1160620	1163220	Unfortunately, free will isn't a scientific reality.
1163220	1167340	It is a myth inherited from Christian theology.
1167340	1171540	Theologians developed the idea of free will to explain why God is right to punish sinners
1171540	1175460	for their bad choices and reward saints for their good choices.
1175460	1179940	If our choices aren't made freely, why should God punish or reward us for them?
1179940	1184100	According to theologians, it is reasonable for God to do so because our choices reflect
1184100	1188500	the free will of our eternal souls, which are independent of all physical and biological
1188500	1189500	constraints.
1189500	1194260	This myth has little to do with what science now teaches us about homo sapiens and other
1194260	1195260	animals.
1195260	1197460	Humans certainly have a will, but it isn't free.
1197460	1199820	You cannot decide what desires you have.
1199820	1205140	You don't decide to be introverted or extroverted, easygoing or anxious, gay or straight.
1205140	1208780	Humans make choices, but they are never independent choices.
1208780	1212780	If every choice depends on a lot of biological, social, and personal conditions that you cannot
1212780	1217860	determine for yourself, I can choose what to eat, whom to marry, and whom to vote for,
1217860	1221820	but these choices are determined in part by my genes, my biochemistry, my gender, my
1221820	1224340	family background, my national culture, etc.
1224340	1226780	I didn't choose which genes or family to have.
1226780	1232040	The problem with this point of view is that it's conflating circumstances with choices
1232040	1233700	and they're not the same thing.
1233700	1235140	What's a good example?
1235140	1236420	Boogie is a good example.
1236420	1245100	Boogie was like a 600 pound goliath of a man, like grotesquely fat, okay?
1245100	1251060	But he has made the choice to make some lifestyle changes, and there was definitely some surgery
1251060	1254960	along with that, but he made choices.
1254960	1260100	In fact, the choice to get the surgery was a choice too, and as a result of those choices,
1260100	1261100	he's losing weight.
1261100	1265500	He's significantly thinner than he was before.
1265500	1270900	Circumstances are not choices, and they can influence choices, but people always have
1270900	1275260	the ability to choose beyond their circumstances.
1275260	1280500	A fat person who has been fat their whole life, who chooses beyond their circumstances
1280500	1283320	to become thin, that's free will.
1283320	1288600	An alcoholic who has been drinking for 20 years, who makes the choice to stop, that's
1288600	1289600	free will.
1289600	1293660	It's not easy, no one's saying that it's easy, but the choice is still there.
1293660	1295300	This is not an abstract theory.
1295300	1296500	You can witness this easily.
1296500	1298900	Just observe the next thought that pops up in your mind.
1298900	1300040	Where did it come from?
1300040	1302120	Did you freely choose to think it?
1302120	1303120	Obviously not.
1303120	1306960	If you carefully observe your own mind, you come to realize that you have little control
1306960	1310880	of what's going on there, and that you are not choosing freely what to think, what to
1310880	1313380	feel, and what to want.
1313380	1314380	That's partially true.
1314380	1317960	However, that does not disprove free will, does it?
1317960	1322920	I mean, yeah, there's obviously some kind of unconscious part of your mind that you
1322920	1325840	do not have any kind of free will over.
1325840	1329280	You're going to get stray thoughts, you're going to get dreams, you're going to get all
1329280	1333880	these situations, and yet you can still choose what you do with them.
1333880	1338520	You can get some kind of thought in your mind, you can choose to ignore it, you can choose
1338520	1343300	to act on it, you can choose to ruminate on it but not actually perform any action.
1343300	1345640	You can do a lot of things.
1345640	1351760	Just because there are some uncontrollable parts of yourself doesn't mean that you are,
1351760	1354480	on the whole, uncontrollable.
1354480	1357540	There's a lot of thought experiments in this article, it's probably actually worth reading,
1357540	1359460	but let's get down to the end of it here.
1359460	1363920	If humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don't reflect our free
1363920	1368540	will, what should the point of politics be?
1368540	1370780	That's actually a very good question.
1370780	1377300	However, I'm not sure that those ifs that you started with, those presuppositions, are
1377300	1378300	actually true.
1378300	1383500	But I think there's a far worse problem here than even just politics.
1383500	1390380	If free will really is gone, let's say that it just turns out that undeniably, unrefutably,
1390380	1392240	there is zero free will.
1392240	1397500	Not all free will, not partial free will and partial uncontrollability.
1397500	1398500	Zero free will.
1398500	1403940	If that's the case, how can we morally hold anyone responsible for anything?
1403940	1409680	How can you say that a murderer is responsible for the murders that he committed if there's
1409680	1413240	no free will?
1413240	1416880	Even if we get to a point where there's no free will, it might be beneficial just to
1416880	1422720	keep the illusion of it around, just because society would completely break down without
1422720	1423720	it.
1423720	1426520	And maybe that's the point of this article.
1426520	1430920	In any case, it's good to be back making these again regularly.
1430920	1436960	Hopefully you will see a new video from me, a new full video in fact, coming up this week.
1436960	1443340	And if you do want to see more of me, you can always drop by my Twitch channel, twitch.tv
1443340	1446800	slash shortfatotaku, I usually stream there five nights a week.
1446800	1447800	I'll see you there, hopefully.
1447800	1448840	I love you guys.
