00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
Heya buddies, here's a quick update from Dev, the vacation's over, I posted that debate

00:04.280 --> 00:08.140
yesterday which was quite fun, and me and the gang streamed some Secret of Mana last

00:08.140 --> 00:09.140
night.

00:09.140 --> 00:13.260
I was driving up and down the halls in this scooter, in my shitty Darth Vader costume,

00:13.260 --> 00:17.940
and I was saying in the most like, in the most let's say disabled voice that I could

00:17.940 --> 00:21.420
muster, it's like, wook, I am your father.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.860
That's more of a speech impediment.

00:23.860 --> 00:29.060
And I was just like, and everyone was like laughing at me driving around, and the teachers

00:29.120 --> 00:34.120
were like, who the fuck is on the scooter, I had the mask on, right, and I was just like,

00:34.120 --> 00:44.000
wook, wook, I am your father, and I got, I'm sorry I missed that, I got like a full day

00:44.000 --> 00:45.300
of detention for that.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.760
I've always wanted to play that game three player ever since I was a babby dev.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.980
I know I said yesterday I was going to stream some River City Girls 2 tonight, but sometimes

00:52.980 --> 00:54.520
life just throws you a curveball.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.720
I'm aiming to do the weekly sip tomorrow morning, and me, Lilith, Arch, and Cibs are gonna start

00:58.720 --> 01:04.600
up a second Watch Party series, this time of that god-awful looking upcoming HBO show,

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
The Last of Us.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.280
So look forward to that video on Monday.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.620
I've got more news for you though.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.160
The week off paid off.

01:10.160 --> 01:13.760
YouTube told me my channel is in the clear regarding being squeaky clean, and so the

01:13.760 --> 01:16.320
silver play button is on the way, which is great news.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.040
I'll make sure to do a 100k sub video once I get it, like a year and a half late.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.880
I don't think I'll ever be more late than that for anything.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.880
But to get my channel squeaky clean, I did have to take some videos down, including the

01:26.880 --> 01:29.340
divisive Yes I'm a Centrist video.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.940
That one got flagged for something or other.

01:30.940 --> 01:34.680
A few slack-jawed yokels were making fun of the fact that I took it down, thinking I was

01:34.680 --> 01:37.600
cowardly and backing out due to the backlash or something.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.700
In fact, that brings us to the last thing I want to update you on.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.560
If you were subbed to the Devonitize channel, you probably noticed, last summer, when like

01:44.560 --> 01:47.100
50 videos were dumped onto it all at once.

01:47.100 --> 01:51.240
A few people began to scream in comments about how their feeds were getting raped, and you

01:51.240 --> 01:52.240
know, fair enough.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.160
Devonitize is a channel not run by me personally, but I do know the person who operates it,

01:57.160 --> 02:01.600
and it serves as a repository for all my videos that are limited or demonetized or age restricted

02:01.600 --> 02:02.600
or whatever.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.280
So, a lot of the videos that I had to recently take down, including the Centrist one, will

02:06.280 --> 02:09.520
be coming up over there, but this time, only one video at a time.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.640
In much the same vein, the Dev and Friends channel, which is one that I actually run,

02:13.640 --> 02:17.740
over there, a lot of the old dumping with scrumps, old interviews and debates, old tub

02:17.740 --> 02:22.300
cast episodes, they're all being uploaded over there, again, one a day, starting tomorrow.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.440
I have a specific vision of what SFO should be that I want to try and work towards.

02:26.440 --> 02:31.340
The goal being a daily video of some type, with streams and other things being a bonus,

02:31.340 --> 02:35.080
while the side channels each serve a purpose that doesn't quite fit in with the main one.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.580
A lot of this stuff is still a little while off, but another project that I set into motion

02:38.580 --> 02:42.700
during my week off, was to work towards an SFO Arcade Clips channel.

02:42.700 --> 02:46.380
There's been a number of people who have told me that they would watch my gaming content,

02:46.380 --> 02:50.660
but they just don't have time to watch hours upon hours of stream vods, or tune in every

02:50.660 --> 02:51.660
single night.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.960
So, I'm going to look into bringing somebody on to cut streams up into best of moments,

02:55.960 --> 02:58.700
but that's not going to be coming until February at least.

02:58.700 --> 03:02.980
One last bit of news, I'm finally going to be relaunching the Minecraft servers soon,

03:02.980 --> 03:06.240
this time with some mods and a fresh map, to see if we can bring it back to life.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.780
But there's also been a lot of interest in a Team Fortress 2 server, so that's in the

03:09.780 --> 03:10.780
cards too.

03:10.780 --> 03:14.060
I'm going to try to do this stuff before February, before the clips channel.

03:14.060 --> 03:17.100
That's everything coming up, I'll probably repeat all this in the weekly sip tomorrow,

03:17.100 --> 03:19.420
but if you don't watch that, that's what's going on with me.

03:19.420 --> 03:23.060
Thanks for all the support guys, all the tips that I get through twitch subs and memberships

03:23.060 --> 03:24.700
and subscribestar and whatever else.

03:24.700 --> 03:28.700
Make sure to get yourself in the SFO discord, because we're finally doing movie nights again,

03:28.700 --> 03:30.900
even if some people complain about my movie choice.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.980
And yeah, everything seems to be going pretty well.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.460
I'm excited for what's coming down the pipe.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.500
I'll see you guys later, I love you.
