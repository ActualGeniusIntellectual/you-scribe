00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Heya buddies, here's a quick update from Dev, the vacation's over, I posted that debate

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,140
yesterday which was quite fun, and me and the gang streamed some Secret of Mana last

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,140
night.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,260
I was driving up and down the halls in this scooter, in my shitty Darth Vader costume,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,940
and I was saying in the most like, in the most let's say disabled voice that I could

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,420
muster, it's like, wook, I am your father.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,860
That's more of a speech impediment.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,060
And I was just like, and everyone was like laughing at me driving around, and the teachers

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,120
were like, who the fuck is on the scooter, I had the mask on, right, and I was just like,

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:44,000
wook, wook, I am your father, and I got, I'm sorry I missed that, I got like a full day

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,300
of detention for that.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,760
I've always wanted to play that game three player ever since I was a babby dev.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,980
I know I said yesterday I was going to stream some River City Girls 2 tonight, but sometimes

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,520
life just throws you a curveball.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm aiming to do the weekly sip tomorrow morning, and me, Lilith, Arch, and Cibs are gonna start

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,600
up a second Watch Party series, this time of that god-awful looking upcoming HBO show,

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
The Last of Us.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
So look forward to that video on Monday.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,620
I've got more news for you though.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,160
The week off paid off.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,760
YouTube told me my channel is in the clear regarding being squeaky clean, and so the

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,320
silver play button is on the way, which is great news.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,040
I'll make sure to do a 100k sub video once I get it, like a year and a half late.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,880
I don't think I'll ever be more late than that for anything.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
But to get my channel squeaky clean, I did have to take some videos down, including the

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,340
divisive Yes I'm a Centrist video.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,940
That one got flagged for something or other.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,680
A few slack-jawed yokels were making fun of the fact that I took it down, thinking I was

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,600
cowardly and backing out due to the backlash or something.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,700
In fact, that brings us to the last thing I want to update you on.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,560
If you were subbed to the Devonitize channel, you probably noticed, last summer, when like

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,100
50 videos were dumped onto it all at once.

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,240
A few people began to scream in comments about how their feeds were getting raped, and you

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
know, fair enough.

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,160
Devonitize is a channel not run by me personally, but I do know the person who operates it,

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,600
and it serves as a repository for all my videos that are limited or demonetized or age restricted

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
or whatever.

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,280
So, a lot of the videos that I had to recently take down, including the Centrist one, will

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,520
be coming up over there, but this time, only one video at a time.

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,640
In much the same vein, the Dev and Friends channel, which is one that I actually run,

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,740
over there, a lot of the old dumping with scrumps, old interviews and debates, old tub

42
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,300
cast episodes, they're all being uploaded over there, again, one a day, starting tomorrow.

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,440
I have a specific vision of what SFO should be that I want to try and work towards.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,340
The goal being a daily video of some type, with streams and other things being a bonus,

45
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,080
while the side channels each serve a purpose that doesn't quite fit in with the main one.

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,580
A lot of this stuff is still a little while off, but another project that I set into motion

47
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,700
during my week off, was to work towards an SFO Arcade Clips channel.

48
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,380
There's been a number of people who have told me that they would watch my gaming content,

49
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,660
but they just don't have time to watch hours upon hours of stream vods, or tune in every

50
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,660
single night.

51
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,960
So, I'm going to look into bringing somebody on to cut streams up into best of moments,

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,700
but that's not going to be coming until February at least.

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,980
One last bit of news, I'm finally going to be relaunching the Minecraft servers soon,

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,240
this time with some mods and a fresh map, to see if we can bring it back to life.

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,780
But there's also been a lot of interest in a Team Fortress 2 server, so that's in the

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
cards too.

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,060
I'm going to try to do this stuff before February, before the clips channel.

58
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,100
That's everything coming up, I'll probably repeat all this in the weekly sip tomorrow,

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,420
but if you don't watch that, that's what's going on with me.

60
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,060
Thanks for all the support guys, all the tips that I get through twitch subs and memberships

61
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,700
and subscribestar and whatever else.

62
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Make sure to get yourself in the SFO discord, because we're finally doing movie nights again,

63
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,900
even if some people complain about my movie choice.

64
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,980
And yeah, everything seems to be going pretty well.

65
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,460
I'm excited for what's coming down the pipe.

66
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,500
I'll see you guys later, I love you.
