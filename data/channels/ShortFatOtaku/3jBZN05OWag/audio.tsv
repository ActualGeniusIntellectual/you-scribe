0	4280	Heya buddies, here's a quick update from Dev, the vacation's over, I posted that debate
4280	8140	yesterday which was quite fun, and me and the gang streamed some Secret of Mana last
8140	9140	night.
9140	13260	I was driving up and down the halls in this scooter, in my shitty Darth Vader costume,
13260	17940	and I was saying in the most like, in the most let's say disabled voice that I could
17940	21420	muster, it's like, wook, I am your father.
21420	23860	That's more of a speech impediment.
23860	29060	And I was just like, and everyone was like laughing at me driving around, and the teachers
29120	34120	were like, who the fuck is on the scooter, I had the mask on, right, and I was just like,
34120	44000	wook, wook, I am your father, and I got, I'm sorry I missed that, I got like a full day
44000	45300	of detention for that.
45300	48760	I've always wanted to play that game three player ever since I was a babby dev.
48760	52980	I know I said yesterday I was going to stream some River City Girls 2 tonight, but sometimes
52980	54520	life just throws you a curveball.
54520	58720	I'm aiming to do the weekly sip tomorrow morning, and me, Lilith, Arch, and Cibs are gonna start
58720	64600	up a second Watch Party series, this time of that god-awful looking upcoming HBO show,
64600	65600	The Last of Us.
65600	67280	So look forward to that video on Monday.
67280	68620	I've got more news for you though.
68620	70160	The week off paid off.
70160	73760	YouTube told me my channel is in the clear regarding being squeaky clean, and so the
73760	76320	silver play button is on the way, which is great news.
76320	80040	I'll make sure to do a 100k sub video once I get it, like a year and a half late.
80040	82880	I don't think I'll ever be more late than that for anything.
82880	86880	But to get my channel squeaky clean, I did have to take some videos down, including the
86880	89340	divisive Yes I'm a Centrist video.
89340	90940	That one got flagged for something or other.
90940	94680	A few slack-jawed yokels were making fun of the fact that I took it down, thinking I was
94680	97600	cowardly and backing out due to the backlash or something.
97600	100700	In fact, that brings us to the last thing I want to update you on.
100700	104560	If you were subbed to the Devonitize channel, you probably noticed, last summer, when like
104560	107100	50 videos were dumped onto it all at once.
107100	111240	A few people began to scream in comments about how their feeds were getting raped, and you
111240	112240	know, fair enough.
112240	117160	Devonitize is a channel not run by me personally, but I do know the person who operates it,
117160	121600	and it serves as a repository for all my videos that are limited or demonetized or age restricted
121600	122600	or whatever.
122600	126280	So, a lot of the videos that I had to recently take down, including the Centrist one, will
126280	129520	be coming up over there, but this time, only one video at a time.
129520	133640	In much the same vein, the Dev and Friends channel, which is one that I actually run,
133640	137740	over there, a lot of the old dumping with scrumps, old interviews and debates, old tub
137740	142300	cast episodes, they're all being uploaded over there, again, one a day, starting tomorrow.
142300	146440	I have a specific vision of what SFO should be that I want to try and work towards.
146440	151340	The goal being a daily video of some type, with streams and other things being a bonus,
151340	155080	while the side channels each serve a purpose that doesn't quite fit in with the main one.
155080	158580	A lot of this stuff is still a little while off, but another project that I set into motion
158580	162700	during my week off, was to work towards an SFO Arcade Clips channel.
162700	166380	There's been a number of people who have told me that they would watch my gaming content,
166380	170660	but they just don't have time to watch hours upon hours of stream vods, or tune in every
170660	171660	single night.
171660	175960	So, I'm going to look into bringing somebody on to cut streams up into best of moments,
175960	178700	but that's not going to be coming until February at least.
178700	182980	One last bit of news, I'm finally going to be relaunching the Minecraft servers soon,
182980	186240	this time with some mods and a fresh map, to see if we can bring it back to life.
186240	189780	But there's also been a lot of interest in a Team Fortress 2 server, so that's in the
189780	190780	cards too.
190780	194060	I'm going to try to do this stuff before February, before the clips channel.
194060	197100	That's everything coming up, I'll probably repeat all this in the weekly sip tomorrow,
197100	199420	but if you don't watch that, that's what's going on with me.
199420	203060	Thanks for all the support guys, all the tips that I get through twitch subs and memberships
203060	204700	and subscribestar and whatever else.
204700	208700	Make sure to get yourself in the SFO discord, because we're finally doing movie nights again,
208700	210900	even if some people complain about my movie choice.
210900	212980	And yeah, everything seems to be going pretty well.
212980	214460	I'm excited for what's coming down the pipe.
214460	216500	I'll see you guys later, I love you.
