{"text": " The hot new term of the day is a radicalization. Just in case you couldn't tell, that's a combination of traditional and radicalization. Subsequently, to be radicalized is basically to be radicalized towards the idea of a traditional life. This is generally used in reference to tradwives. A tradwife is a specific type of wojack variant where it shows a young female wojack wearing like a blue a blue dress and she has you know long blonde hair. She's very traditional in how she looks and generally the memes revolve around her wanting to do traditional things and have a traditional life. And she's almost always contrasted in the memes with either a a soy boy male feminist or a promiscuous woman. And some of the criticism coming from the social justice warriors regarding the uh the chad yes meme and the tradwife meme as they're as they're often paired together um is actually legitimate. For example you know she she is wearing a style of clothing that is you know quite outdated meanwhile he's simply wearing a hoodie. He's not nearly as traditional at least in how he looks as she is and you can make the argument that well there's probably some kind of imbalance there that needs to be addressed. A lot of the alt-right people who want tradwives they're probably jacking it five times to trap porn every single day. But nonetheless that doesn't make the desire for a traditional style wife or to live a traditional style life um invalid. That's a perfectly reasonable thing to want for yourself and it's also a perfectly reasonable thing to not want that if that happens to be you. There are definitely people who find traditional family values you know happy and and fulfilling and wholesome and they do really want to have kids and they basically want to cultivate this this specific type of life. And then there are people who aren't cut out for that. There are people for whom the family structure might seem oppressive because they were actually abused by their parents or something. There are people who feel like they don't want to have children because that's just not their life path. But just because someone wants something that is traditional doesn't mean that they're evil. And in fact we've got this article from the BBC called why I submit to my husband like it's 1959. And the twitter intro to this article is is quite interesting. We'll introduce you to a tradwife a young woman who has chosen to be a traditional wife staying at home to take care of the household chores while her husband works and she is fine with submitting to her husband as he makes the key decisions in their lives. And the actual story itself is literally just like a look into the life of somebody who lives like this and it's not all that interesting because I think we all know how people like this live at least on some level. But the blowback that this got was incredible. Who needs youtube rabbit holes when you have the BBC broadcasting literal white supremacist propaganda? You know you know race isn't really a factor in terms of the story behind that article. And you really have to wonder what kind of headspace you're in when you think that like your mother making you breakfast before she brings you to school or your mother making you dinner after you come home or that the woman doing any kind of domestic work at all that that's white supremacy. I've heard the argument that it's anti-feminist now for for at least 20 years but white supremacy? What happens to all of those various families who um who are made up of non-white women who do this? What about all those muslim families where women are forced to do this? Are they white supremacist Becca? Of course keep in mind this person here Becca Lewis she was the one who who wrote Alternative Influence broadcasting the reactionary right on youtube. That ridiculous report a couple of years ago that basically branded anybody who talks to alt-right figures as alt-right themselves. Like Ben Shapiro the notorious white supremacist Jew or Joe Rogan or Sargon or or any of these other people that are all just alt-right according to this person. However Becca did feel a need to explain her position. For those in my comments who don't seem to know so-called tradwives are white supremacist women who devote themselves to domestic duties in the service of perpetuating the white race. It is a dog whistle meant to sound less white supremacist than it is. Again what happens when a bunch of non-white women do this? I didn't know that if you take like two brown people and then they have a kid but at the same time the woman is doing household chores the kid comes out white. I guess race really is a social construct but we really have reached that point of madness where a woman who stays at home and you know vacuums or brings out the garbage or or cooks or cleans or whatever that's white supremacy now. Any form of traditionalism especially if a woman's doing it is white supremacy it's it's Nazism it's the alt-right. Tradwives the new trend for submissive women has a dark heart in history. A certain kind of housewife has found social media and is airing the details of their fight with feminism but maybe they should tone it down a notch. Oh really? So you crazies can post the most ridiculous bullshit on twitter the most radicalized insane propaganda calling for the deaths of your political opponents calling for violent revolution against capitalism and the putting down of counter-revolutionary elements within society but when a woman says she wants to stay at home and make a cake or something now you've gone too far on the internet. Holy shit. Rather awkwardly for the British tradwives who like to suggest their movement is just about dressing in a Kath Kidston and letting their husband choose where they're going on holiday in the U.S. and elsewhere it is very much part of the alt-right movement. It is especially popular among white supremacists who are extremely down with the message that white women should submit to their husband and focus on making as many white babies as possible. British tradwives insist this has nothing to do with them. Some even said this type of housewife was promoted by the third reich and it's like really? I didn't even know that. Yeah and Stalin and the communists also promoted the the births of the working class as well. This is not something unique to fucking Hitler and Nazism. You know that Hitler was a vegetarian right and he liked dogs? Are we suddenly going to ban vegetables and butcher all dogs in the street? Is that where we're going with this? It is not a Nazi thing to promote healthy families. It's a civilization surviving thing. Oh hey Mike Struckberry. How long until your girl cheats on you? What are you doing laundering the tradwife thing? It's almost entirely associated with far-right groups and activists. I like how it's laundering now. If someone you dislike has a little thing, even if that thing is literally the family unit, to promote that in any kind of positive light, even if there's actual positivity to be found there, is laundering it. The whole tradwife thing was only a reality for a narrow middle-class group. The vast majority of women worked, the work just wasn't valued. There's actually some some point to this. I do know that back when the 1950s style housewife was was in full swing there were a lot of poor women who just couldn't afford to do that. There wasn't enough money floating around in the household so they had to get jobs too. But this is where the feminists got it wrong. Staying at home and caring for the house and raising a family, that was a privilege. It was not an oppression. Women were not oppressed when they did that. Well maybe some of them were. I'm sure there were cases where some women just weren't cut out for that sort of thing and didn't want to do it and they were forced into it. But most women, it was a luxury to not have to work outside the home. Because working outside the home, unless you're like doing something exceptional, it sucks. And that whole the work just wasn't valued thing. Well one, when poor women worked outside the house they got paid. So it was obviously valued at something. And two, there has been this other movement going around for a few years now where women who are housewives say that they should be paid these certain wages for doing all of these these various household chores for the man. And it's like well that is what your your work would be valued if you were getting paid. Fair enough because you know work work done domestically it's still real work and it still has value. But the reason that you're not paid is because the man is not your boss and he's not hiring you. You're working together as a team. Nobody pays me when I do my own dishes and nor do I expect it to be paid. It's what you do to have a life. And that isn't the only problem with the whole trad wife thing. There are some other ones. I have an article out next month on the increasing expectations of financial independence on divorce. Anyone who thinks being a trad wife sounds good, it's not quite as good if you get divorced 15 years down the line and have a limited earning capacity. I agree if you're basically going to be completely submitting to somebody else and therefore you you you lose years of your life in the job market and then then you're you're behind in your experience you're behind in your training you're behind in your schooling sometimes. And then the relationship falls apart. You are in a terrible situation and I don't know maybe depending on who you are and what your relationship is you shouldn't be putting all your eggs in that basket. But at the same time this trad wife thing it is obviously for people who are already stable. Like if you're not in a stable relationship already doing this thinking it's going to get better you know it might actually just make your situation worse. But again that doesn't make trad wife itself invalid for people to desire. But no it's it's all just white supremacy. It's all just trans hating gender criticalism. It's all just something that should be in the past. It's all just impeding the advancement of women. If this is your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it. But the trad wife movement is clearly linked to far-right ideologies born in 2016 to help white supremacists with their lack of women. Yeah the thing is when you get like incel types who actually experience a lack of women in their lives a traditional woman won't help them. Because a traditional woman will want but also require a traditional man to to upkeep the relationship. And incels you know for for better or worse don't seem to be able to perform those functions. Because those functions include things that incels generally don't have like the ability to not be bitter all the time about your current life situation. The ability to constantly self-improve in the face of hardship. Incels might be crying about the lack of traditional women but the very act of going on subreddits and crying about it is not something that a traditional man would do. But here's the really interesting part about this whole situation. If this is your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it. Maybe for some people it is a kink or a fetish. Maybe for some people it is it is like a non-sexual thing and they just want to to have that life. Either way this sentence implies that regardless of whatever pressures social justice is putting on the situation if you truly want this then you should be able to do it. And that seems reasonable to me. But then you get things like this. I said I wanted to be a wife and a mum. The teacher laughed at me. Tradwife is a growing movement of women who promote ultra-traditional gender roles. She says it's feminist as she's choosing what she wants to do. This sentence is almost written as if it's not feminist but this person is falsely claiming as if it is. And that does seem to be the position of radical feminism right now. This is an older article but it still checks out. No feminism is not about choice written in 2015 but still relevant today regarding how feminists view the situation. Feminism is back in fashion. As the push to claim the f-word has intensified public figures corporations and much of the mainstream media have propelled a largely unchallenging version of feminism into the popular consciousness. It is a feminism that never mentions women's liberation instead opting for a celebration of choice. First of all the choice arguments are fundamentally flawed because they assume a level of unmitigated freedom for women that simply doesn't exist. But the choices are shaped and constrained by the unequal conditions in which we live. It would only make sense to uncritically celebrate choice in a post-patriarchal world. Well that just sounds like everyone alive. Yes we all make choices but we all have constraints on us. Like you always have to eat. You always have to sleep. There are certain things that you have to do to stay alive. Just because your choices are bounded by those realities doesn't mean that you don't have the choice. You are literally arguing against the nature of existence. Second the idea that more choices automatically equate to more freedom is a falsehood. That is literally what freedom is is the freedom to choose to pick what you want to do with your life and your time and your energy. Yes women can now work or stay at home if they have children for example but this choice is fairly hollow when child rearing continues to be constructed as women's work. There is insufficient state support for child care and childless women are decried as selfish. What you're talking about are social pressures and it is very common for people who truly want something unorthodox to have to fight against social pressures. That is in fact part of what makes the victory of achieving that thing so much more enjoyable. What you are asking for is the ability to do something different without the cost of doing something different. Third the focus on women's choices as the be-all and end-all of feminism has resulted in a perverse kind of victim blaming and a distraction from the real problems women still face. If you're not happy with the way things are don't blame misogyny and sexism, the pay gap, entrenched gender roles, women's lack of representation, or an epidemic of violence. Blame yourself you made the wrong choice. This is the thing though sometimes you did. The pay gap. Why do women go into fields that pay less? Entrenched gender roles. Why do women desire them sometimes? Women's lack of representation on boards or in parliament. Why don't women do the same things that men do to get into these positions? Sometimes it is the case that you should blame yourself because sometimes it is the case that you made the wrong choice. It is not the patriarchy when you make a mistake but no the radical feminists of today have largely abandoned the idea of personal choice and it is all about power politics. It's all about doing what is non-traditional to fight the patriarchy and women who actually try a traditional life they are traitors to the movement. Even though they want that and they've actively chosen it and they're not being forced. Sorry feminism is not about choice. Liberal feminism asks nothing of women and delivers nothing in return. But that is kind of the point because the liberals only ask to be left alone to have the freedom to pursue what makes them happy and fulfilled. But a radical movement can't simply leave people alone it has to radicalize them. It has to take whatever beliefs they may hold, reinforce the ones that fit the radicalization and purge the ones that don't. Why saying it's my choice doesn't always make it a feminist choice? All choices are not feminist. Many a times we think having a choice and deciding something is enough to make it feminist but the truth is far from this. I would go so far as to say that radical feminism was never about women's choice. It was always about women's radicalization. That's what makes it radical. And when those articles are the propaganda here is the mindset that it produces. If you are a housewife or a stay-at-home mom you have no right to call yourself a feminist. You have literally surrendered yourself to the patriarchy. Don't speak up for us when you're enslaved to a man. Real feminists don't welcome you. Y'all are fake feminists. Real feminists work. Real feminists don't get married. Real feminists don't give their life to any man. Y'all disgust me. If you don't think this person's been radicalized I don't know what to tell you. But that's why the term is radicalization. If it's all just power politics. If you can't be still on a moving train then if you're not being radicalized towards radical feminism then you are being radicalized towards traditional life and patriarchy and the total submission of all women. To the radical feminists there is no choice in feminism. There is only supporting the movement as a good proper revolutionary or living your life as a white supremacist regardless of your race I guess. But the truth is in the choice. I'm not going to sit here and and say that all women if they simply chose to be trad wives would be happy. I don't think so. I think a lot of them would. However I do think that there are just some people who aren't cut out for traditional gender roles and that's fine. If it turns out that you are actually one of those one in a million people if for some reason you actually don't want kids and it would not be good for you to have them or if it turns out that you're actually just 100% gay or if it turns out that you'd rather not be tied down and you want to travel most of your life and not really live in any single city for more for more than a year or something. If it turns out that you just have a different idea of what your life should be then you should have the freedom to pursue that. And in the same vein if you have a traditional idea of what your life should be then you should have the freedom to pursue that. And I think deep down if we if we think about it if we meditate on it and if we're honest with ourselves we all know what kind of life we want we all know what parts of traditionalism we want to incorporate into our future and what parts we want to maybe let go or or de-emphasize a little bit and it's gonna be different for every person. I'm willing to bet that if most of those militant political lesbians sit down and have the strength to be honest with themselves they'll realize that you know maybe they're not actually lesbians. In the same vein I think a lot of people who really desire a hardcore traditional life if they sit down and meditate on a little bit and they have the fortitude to be honest with themselves they'll probably realize that you know there are some things about modern life that are you know a little bit better than how it was a few hundred years ago. And maybe we shouldn't be so quick to completely expel the modern lifestyle simply because it's new. I probably sound like a broken record at this point but again the answer is individualism. The answer is personal freedom. Figure out what you want in your life and go and do it. And don't let anybody tell you that you're a counter-revolutionary element or that you're a white supremacist because you're you're acting traditionally. And in the same vein don't let anybody tell you that you're a degenerate because you do something that is a bit offbeat. Be honest with yourself and pursue whatever it is that will bring your life meaning. And don't let anyone tell you you should do anything else simply because of some political position.
