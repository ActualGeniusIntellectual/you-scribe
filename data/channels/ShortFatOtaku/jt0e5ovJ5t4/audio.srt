1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
The hot new term of the day is a radicalization.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,480
Just in case you couldn't tell, that's a combination of traditional and

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
radicalization. Subsequently, to be radicalized is

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,960
basically to be radicalized towards the idea of a traditional life.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,080
This is generally used in reference to tradwives.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,720
A tradwife is a specific type of wojack variant where it shows

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,040
a young female wojack wearing like a blue a blue dress and she has you know

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,760
long blonde hair. She's very traditional in how she looks

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
and generally the memes revolve around her wanting to do traditional things and

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,800
have a traditional life. And she's almost always contrasted in

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,440
the memes with either a a soy boy male feminist

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,200
or a promiscuous woman. And some of the criticism coming from the social justice

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,440
warriors regarding the uh the chad yes meme and the tradwife

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,760
meme as they're as they're often paired together

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,160
um is actually legitimate. For example you know she she is wearing a style of

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
clothing that is you know quite outdated

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,240
meanwhile he's simply wearing a hoodie. He's not nearly as traditional at least

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,360
in how he looks as she is and you can make the argument that

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
well there's probably some kind of imbalance there that needs to be

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,480
addressed. A lot of the alt-right people who want

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,720
tradwives they're probably jacking it five times to trap porn every single day.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,720
But nonetheless that doesn't make the desire for a traditional style wife or

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,400
to live a traditional style life um invalid. That's a perfectly reasonable

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
thing to want for yourself and it's also a perfectly reasonable

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,760
thing to not want that if that happens to be you.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,040
There are definitely people who find traditional family values you know happy

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,800
and and fulfilling and wholesome and they do really want to have kids and

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,080
they basically want to cultivate this this specific type of life. And then

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,960
there are people who aren't cut out for that. There are people for whom

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,680
the family structure might seem oppressive because they were actually

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
abused by their parents or something. There are people who feel like they

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
don't want to have children because that's just not their life path. But just

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
because someone wants something that is traditional

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,400
doesn't mean that they're evil. And in fact we've got this article from the

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,960
BBC called why I submit to my husband like it's 1959.

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,720
And the twitter intro to this article is is quite interesting. We'll introduce you

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,280
to a tradwife a young woman who has chosen to be a

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,240
traditional wife staying at home to take care of the household chores while her

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,960
husband works and she is fine with submitting to her

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,840
husband as he makes the key decisions in their lives.

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,880
And the actual story itself is literally just like

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,400
a look into the life of somebody who lives like this and it's not all that

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
interesting because I think we all know how people like this live at least on

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,160
some level. But the blowback that this got was

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,440
incredible. Who needs youtube rabbit holes when you

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,440
have the BBC broadcasting literal white supremacist

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,920
propaganda? You know you know race isn't really a

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
factor in terms of the story behind that article.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
And you really have to wonder what kind of headspace you're in when you think

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
that like your mother making you breakfast before

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
she brings you to school or your mother making you dinner after you come home

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
or that the woman doing any kind of domestic work at all

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
that that's white supremacy. I've heard the argument that it's anti-feminist now

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,240
for for at least 20 years but white supremacy? What happens to all

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,920
of those various families who um who are made up of non-white women who

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
do this? What about all those muslim families where women are forced to do

57
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,680
this? Are they white supremacist Becca?

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,200
Of course keep in mind this person here Becca Lewis she was the one who

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,960
who wrote Alternative Influence broadcasting the reactionary right on

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,440
youtube. That ridiculous report a couple of years

61
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,680
ago that basically branded anybody who talks to alt-right figures as

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,680
alt-right themselves. Like Ben Shapiro the notorious white supremacist

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
Jew or Joe Rogan or Sargon or or any of these other people

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,800
that are all just alt-right according to this person. However Becca did feel a

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,240
need to explain her position. For those in my comments who don't seem

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,720
to know so-called tradwives are white supremacist women who devote themselves

67
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,160
to domestic duties in the service of perpetuating the

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,280
white race. It is a dog whistle meant to sound less

69
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
white supremacist than it is. Again what happens when a bunch of

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
non-white women do this? I didn't know that if you take like two

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
brown people and then they have a kid but at the same time the

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
woman is doing household chores the kid comes out white. I guess race

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
really is a social construct but we really have reached that point of

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,400
madness where a woman who stays at home and you

75
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
know vacuums or brings out the garbage or or cooks or

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
cleans or whatever that's white supremacy now.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
Any form of traditionalism especially if a woman's doing it

78
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,480
is white supremacy it's it's Nazism it's the alt-right.

79
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,280
Tradwives the new trend for submissive women has a dark heart in history.

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
A certain kind of housewife has found social media and is airing the details

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,560
of their fight with feminism but maybe they should tone it down a

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,400
notch. Oh really? So you crazies can post the most ridiculous

83
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,480
bullshit on twitter the most radicalized insane propaganda

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
calling for the deaths of your political opponents

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,080
calling for violent revolution against capitalism and the putting down of

86
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
counter-revolutionary elements within society but when a woman says

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,640
she wants to stay at home and make a cake or something

88
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,560
now you've gone too far on the internet. Holy shit.

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,080
Rather awkwardly for the British tradwives who like to suggest their

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
movement is just about dressing in a Kath Kidston

91
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
and letting their husband choose where they're going on holiday in the U.S.

92
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,440
and elsewhere it is very much part of the alt-right movement.

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,360
It is especially popular among white supremacists who are extremely down with

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,320
the message that white women should submit to their husband and focus on

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,560
making as many white babies as possible. British tradwives insist this has

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
nothing to do with them. Some even said this type of housewife

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
was promoted by the third reich and it's like really? I didn't even know

98
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,040
that. Yeah and Stalin and the communists also promoted

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,480
the the births of the working class as well. This is

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,000
not something unique to fucking Hitler and Nazism.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
You know that Hitler was a vegetarian right and he liked dogs?

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,040
Are we suddenly going to ban vegetables and butcher all dogs in the street?

103
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,280
Is that where we're going with this? It is not a Nazi thing to promote healthy

104
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,200
families. It's a civilization surviving thing. Oh

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,160
hey Mike Struckberry. How long until your girl cheats on you?

106
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,840
What are you doing laundering the tradwife thing? It's almost entirely

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,880
associated with far-right groups and activists. I like

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,160
how it's laundering now. If someone you dislike has a little

109
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,440
thing, even if that thing is literally the family unit,

110
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,120
to promote that in any kind of positive light, even if there's actual

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
positivity to be found there, is laundering it. The whole tradwife

112
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,760
thing was only a reality for a narrow middle-class group.

113
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,040
The vast majority of women worked, the work just wasn't valued.

114
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,680
There's actually some some point to this. I do know that back when the 1950s style

115
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,440
housewife was was in full swing there were a lot of poor women who just

116
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,080
couldn't afford to do that. There wasn't enough money floating

117
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
around in the household so they had to get jobs too. But this is where the

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
feminists got it wrong. Staying at home and caring for the house

119
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,840
and raising a family, that was a privilege. It was not an

120
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
oppression. Women were not oppressed when they did that. Well maybe some of them

121
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
were. I'm sure there were cases where some women just

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,160
weren't cut out for that sort of thing and didn't want to do it and they were

123
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
forced into it. But most women, it was a luxury

124
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,600
to not have to work outside the home. Because working outside the home, unless

125
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,640
you're like doing something exceptional, it sucks.

126
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,680
And that whole the work just wasn't valued thing. Well

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
one, when poor women worked outside the house they got paid. So it was obviously

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,920
valued at something. And two, there has been this other

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,400
movement going around for a few years now

130
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
where women who are housewives say that they should be paid these certain wages

131
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
for doing all of these these various household chores for the man.

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,680
And it's like well that is what your your work would be valued if you were

133
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
getting paid. Fair enough because you know work work

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
done domestically it's still real work and it still has value.

135
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,800
But the reason that you're not paid is because the man is not your boss and

136
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
he's not hiring you. You're working together as a team.

137
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,560
Nobody pays me when I do my own dishes and nor do I expect it to be paid. It's

138
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,520
what you do to have a life. And that isn't the only problem with the

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
whole trad wife thing. There are some other ones.

140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,960
I have an article out next month on the increasing expectations of financial

141
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,160
independence on divorce. Anyone who thinks being a trad wife

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400
sounds good, it's not quite as good if you get divorced 15 years down the line

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,760
and have a limited earning capacity. I agree if you're basically going to be

144
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,080
completely submitting to somebody else and therefore you you you lose years of

145
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,400
your life in the job market and then then you're

146
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
you're behind in your experience you're behind in your training you're behind

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
in your schooling sometimes. And then the relationship falls apart.

148
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
You are in a terrible situation and I don't know maybe depending on who you

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,720
are and what your relationship is you shouldn't be putting all your eggs in

150
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,880
that basket. But at the same time this trad wife thing it is obviously for

151
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,480
people who are already stable. Like if you're not in a stable

152
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,840
relationship already doing this thinking it's going to get

153
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,640
better you know it might actually just make your situation worse.

154
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,120
But again that doesn't make trad wife itself invalid for people to desire.

155
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,400
But no it's it's all just white supremacy. It's all just

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,720
trans hating gender criticalism. It's all just something that should be in the

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
past. It's all just impeding the advancement of women.

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
If this is your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it.

159
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,480
But the trad wife movement is clearly linked to far-right ideologies born in

160
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
2016 to help white supremacists with their

161
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
lack of women. Yeah the thing is when you get like incel types who

162
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,760
actually experience a lack of women in their lives

163
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
a traditional woman won't help them. Because a traditional woman will want

164
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,840
but also require a traditional man to to upkeep the relationship.

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,840
And incels you know for for better or worse don't seem to be able

166
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,000
to perform those functions. Because those functions include things that incels

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
generally don't have like the ability to not be bitter all the

168
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,800
time about your current life situation. The ability to constantly self-improve in

169
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
the face of hardship. Incels might be crying about the lack of

170
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
traditional women but the very act of going on subreddits and crying about it

171
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
is not something that a traditional man would do.

172
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,760
But here's the really interesting part about this whole situation. If this is

173
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,600
your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it. Maybe for

174
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
some people it is a kink or a fetish. Maybe for some people it is it is like a

175
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,920
non-sexual thing and they just want to to have that life. Either way

176
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,200
this sentence implies that regardless of whatever pressures

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,440
social justice is putting on the situation

178
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,000
if you truly want this then you should be able to do it. And that seems

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
reasonable to me. But then you get things like this.

180
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,000
I said I wanted to be a wife and a mum. The teacher laughed at me.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Tradwife is a growing movement of women who promote ultra-traditional gender

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,640
roles. She says it's feminist as she's choosing

183
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,800
what she wants to do. This sentence is almost written as if

184
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,120
it's not feminist but this person is falsely claiming as if it is.

185
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,960
And that does seem to be the position of radical feminism right now. This is an

186
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,760
older article but it still checks out. No feminism is not about choice written

187
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
in 2015 but still relevant today regarding how feminists view the

188
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
situation. Feminism is back in fashion. As the push

189
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
to claim the f-word has intensified public figures corporations and much of

190
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,520
the mainstream media have propelled a largely unchallenging version of

191
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,680
feminism into the popular consciousness. It is a feminism that never mentions

192
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,880
women's liberation instead opting for a celebration of

193
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
choice. First of all the choice arguments are

194
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
fundamentally flawed because they assume a level of unmitigated freedom for women

195
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
that simply doesn't exist. But the choices are shaped and

196
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
constrained by the unequal conditions in which we live.

197
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
It would only make sense to uncritically celebrate choice in a post-patriarchal

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,960
world. Well that just sounds like everyone

199
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,160
alive. Yes we all make choices but we all have

200
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,400
constraints on us. Like you always have to eat.

201
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,680
You always have to sleep. There are certain things that you have to do to

202
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,520
stay alive. Just because your choices are bounded by

203
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,400
those realities doesn't mean that you don't have the

204
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,600
choice. You are literally arguing against the nature of existence.

205
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,520
Second the idea that more choices automatically equate to more freedom is

206
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,040
a falsehood. That is literally what freedom is is the

207
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,920
freedom to choose to pick what you want to do with your

208
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,840
life and your time and your energy. Yes women can now work or stay at home

209
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,440
if they have children for example but this choice is fairly hollow when

210
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
child rearing continues to be constructed as women's work.

211
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,920
There is insufficient state support for child care and childless women are

212
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,880
decried as selfish. What you're talking about are

213
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,760
social pressures and it is very common for people who

214
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
truly want something unorthodox to have to fight against social

215
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,320
pressures. That is in fact part of what makes the victory of

216
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,800
achieving that thing so much more enjoyable. What you are asking for

217
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,320
is the ability to do something different

218
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,000
without the cost of doing something different. Third the focus on women's

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,280
choices as the be-all and end-all of feminism

220
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,080
has resulted in a perverse kind of victim blaming

221
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,200
and a distraction from the real problems women still face.

222
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,040
If you're not happy with the way things are don't blame misogyny and sexism, the

223
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,000
pay gap, entrenched gender roles, women's lack of

224
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,080
representation, or an epidemic of violence.

225
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,520
Blame yourself you made the wrong choice. This is the thing though sometimes you

226
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,080
did. The pay gap. Why do women go into fields

227
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,840
that pay less? Entrenched gender roles. Why do women

228
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,840
desire them sometimes? Women's lack of representation on boards

229
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,800
or in parliament. Why don't women do the same things that

230
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
men do to get into these positions? Sometimes it is the case that you should

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
blame yourself because sometimes it is the case that you made the wrong choice.

232
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
It is not the patriarchy when you make a mistake but no the radical feminists of

233
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,920
today have largely abandoned the idea of personal choice and it is all about

234
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
power politics. It's all about doing what is

235
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
non-traditional to fight the patriarchy and women who actually try a traditional

236
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
life they are traitors to the movement. Even

237
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,000
though they want that and they've actively chosen it and they're not

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,280
being forced. Sorry feminism is not about choice.

239
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,040
Liberal feminism asks nothing of women and delivers nothing in return.

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,400
But that is kind of the point because the liberals only ask to be left alone

241
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,000
to have the freedom to pursue what makes them happy and fulfilled. But a radical

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,880
movement can't simply leave people alone it has to

243
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,680
radicalize them. It has to take whatever beliefs they may hold,

244
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,360
reinforce the ones that fit the radicalization and purge the ones that

245
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
don't. Why saying it's my choice doesn't always

246
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,760
make it a feminist choice? All choices are not feminist. Many a

247
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,640
times we think having a choice and deciding something is enough to make it

248
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,560
feminist but the truth is far from this. I would go so far as to say that radical

249
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,920
feminism was never about women's choice. It was

250
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,880
always about women's radicalization. That's what makes it radical.

251
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
And when those articles are the propaganda here is the mindset that it

252
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,960
produces. If you are a housewife or a stay-at-home mom

253
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,960
you have no right to call yourself a feminist. You have literally surrendered

254
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,120
yourself to the patriarchy. Don't speak up for us when you're enslaved to a man.

255
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,560
Real feminists don't welcome you. Y'all are fake feminists.

256
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
Real feminists work. Real feminists don't get married.

257
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,440
Real feminists don't give their life to any man. Y'all disgust me.

258
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
If you don't think this person's been radicalized I don't know what to tell

259
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
you. But that's why the term is

260
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,120
radicalization. If it's all just power politics. If you can't be still on a

261
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,080
moving train then if you're not being radicalized

262
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,640
towards radical feminism then you are being radicalized towards

263
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,840
traditional life and patriarchy and the total submission

264
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,120
of all women. To the radical feminists there is no choice in feminism. There is

265
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
only supporting the movement as a good proper revolutionary

266
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,000
or living your life as a white supremacist regardless of your race I

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,520
guess. But the truth is in the choice. I'm not

268
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,760
going to sit here and and say that all women if they simply chose to be

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
trad wives would be happy. I don't think so. I think a lot of them

270
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,120
would. However I do think that there are just some people who aren't cut out for

271
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
traditional gender roles and that's fine. If it turns out that you are actually

272
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,080
one of those one in a million people if for some reason you actually don't

273
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,160
want kids and it would not be good for you to have them

274
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,080
or if it turns out that you're actually just 100% gay or if it turns out that

275
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,320
you'd rather not be tied down and you want to

276
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
travel most of your life and not really live in any single city for more for

277
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,960
more than a year or something. If it turns out that you just have a

278
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,840
different idea of what your life should be then you

279
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,240
should have the freedom to pursue that. And in the same vein if you have a

280
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
traditional idea of what your life should be

281
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
then you should have the freedom to pursue that. And I think

282
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,200
deep down if we if we think about it if we meditate on it and if we're honest

283
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,560
with ourselves we all know what kind of life we want

284
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,040
we all know what parts of traditionalism we want to incorporate into our future

285
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,440
and what parts we want to maybe let go or or de-emphasize a little bit

286
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,400
and it's gonna be different for every person. I'm willing to bet that if most

287
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,720
of those militant political lesbians sit down

288
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,880
and have the strength to be honest with themselves they'll realize that

289
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,560
you know maybe they're not actually lesbians. In the same vein I think a lot

290
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,840
of people who really desire a hardcore traditional life

291
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,120
if they sit down and meditate on a little bit and they have the fortitude

292
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
to be honest with themselves they'll probably realize that you know

293
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
there are some things about modern life that are

294
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,040
you know a little bit better than how it was a few hundred years ago. And maybe we

295
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
shouldn't be so quick to completely expel

296
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,560
the modern lifestyle simply because it's new. I probably sound like a broken

297
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,640
record at this point but again the answer is individualism. The answer

298
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,080
is personal freedom. Figure out what you want in your life and

299
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,600
go and do it. And don't let anybody tell you that you're a counter-revolutionary

300
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,840
element or that you're a white supremacist because

301
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,800
you're you're acting traditionally. And in the same vein don't let anybody tell

302
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,240
you that you're a degenerate because you do something that is a bit offbeat.

303
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,920
Be honest with yourself and pursue whatever it is that will bring your life

304
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,000
meaning. And don't let anyone tell you you should

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,240
do anything else simply because of some political position. It's all bullshit.
