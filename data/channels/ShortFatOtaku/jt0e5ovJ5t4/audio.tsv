0	3040	The hot new term of the day is a radicalization.
3040	6480	Just in case you couldn't tell, that's a combination of traditional and
6480	10880	radicalization. Subsequently, to be radicalized is
10880	14960	basically to be radicalized towards the idea of a traditional life.
14960	18080	This is generally used in reference to tradwives.
18080	22720	A tradwife is a specific type of wojack variant where it shows
22720	27040	a young female wojack wearing like a blue a blue dress and she has you know
27040	29760	long blonde hair. She's very traditional in how she looks
29760	33760	and generally the memes revolve around her wanting to do traditional things and
33760	36800	have a traditional life. And she's almost always contrasted in
36800	41440	the memes with either a a soy boy male feminist
41440	45200	or a promiscuous woman. And some of the criticism coming from the social justice
45200	49440	warriors regarding the uh the chad yes meme and the tradwife
49440	51760	meme as they're as they're often paired together
51760	56160	um is actually legitimate. For example you know she she is wearing a style of
56160	58480	clothing that is you know quite outdated
58480	62240	meanwhile he's simply wearing a hoodie. He's not nearly as traditional at least
62240	65360	in how he looks as she is and you can make the argument that
65360	68240	well there's probably some kind of imbalance there that needs to be
68240	70480	addressed. A lot of the alt-right people who want
70480	74720	tradwives they're probably jacking it five times to trap porn every single day.
74720	78720	But nonetheless that doesn't make the desire for a traditional style wife or
78720	82400	to live a traditional style life um invalid. That's a perfectly reasonable
82400	85200	thing to want for yourself and it's also a perfectly reasonable
85200	87760	thing to not want that if that happens to be you.
87760	91040	There are definitely people who find traditional family values you know happy
91040	94800	and and fulfilling and wholesome and they do really want to have kids and
94800	98080	they basically want to cultivate this this specific type of life. And then
98080	100960	there are people who aren't cut out for that. There are people for whom
100960	103680	the family structure might seem oppressive because they were actually
103680	106320	abused by their parents or something. There are people who feel like they
106320	109040	don't want to have children because that's just not their life path. But just
109040	111280	because someone wants something that is traditional
111280	114400	doesn't mean that they're evil. And in fact we've got this article from the
114400	118960	BBC called why I submit to my husband like it's 1959.
118960	122720	And the twitter intro to this article is is quite interesting. We'll introduce you
122720	125280	to a tradwife a young woman who has chosen to be a
125280	128240	traditional wife staying at home to take care of the household chores while her
128240	130960	husband works and she is fine with submitting to her
130960	133840	husband as he makes the key decisions in their lives.
133840	136880	And the actual story itself is literally just like
136880	140400	a look into the life of somebody who lives like this and it's not all that
140400	143120	interesting because I think we all know how people like this live at least on
143120	146160	some level. But the blowback that this got was
146160	149440	incredible. Who needs youtube rabbit holes when you
149440	153440	have the BBC broadcasting literal white supremacist
153440	157920	propaganda? You know you know race isn't really a
157920	160560	factor in terms of the story behind that article.
160560	164000	And you really have to wonder what kind of headspace you're in when you think
164000	167280	that like your mother making you breakfast before
167280	170560	she brings you to school or your mother making you dinner after you come home
170560	173680	or that the woman doing any kind of domestic work at all
173680	177680	that that's white supremacy. I've heard the argument that it's anti-feminist now
177680	182240	for for at least 20 years but white supremacy? What happens to all
182240	185920	of those various families who um who are made up of non-white women who
185920	189760	do this? What about all those muslim families where women are forced to do
189760	193680	this? Are they white supremacist Becca?
193680	197200	Of course keep in mind this person here Becca Lewis she was the one who
197200	200960	who wrote Alternative Influence broadcasting the reactionary right on
200960	203440	youtube. That ridiculous report a couple of years
203440	207680	ago that basically branded anybody who talks to alt-right figures as
207680	211680	alt-right themselves. Like Ben Shapiro the notorious white supremacist
211680	215440	Jew or Joe Rogan or Sargon or or any of these other people
215440	218800	that are all just alt-right according to this person. However Becca did feel a
218800	222240	need to explain her position. For those in my comments who don't seem
222240	226720	to know so-called tradwives are white supremacist women who devote themselves
226800	230160	to domestic duties in the service of perpetuating the
230160	233280	white race. It is a dog whistle meant to sound less
233280	237040	white supremacist than it is. Again what happens when a bunch of
237040	240080	non-white women do this? I didn't know that if you take like two
240080	243360	brown people and then they have a kid but at the same time the
243360	247280	woman is doing household chores the kid comes out white. I guess race
247280	250640	really is a social construct but we really have reached that point of
250640	254400	madness where a woman who stays at home and you
254400	257680	know vacuums or brings out the garbage or or cooks or
257680	260160	cleans or whatever that's white supremacy now.
260160	263280	Any form of traditionalism especially if a woman's doing it
263280	266480	is white supremacy it's it's Nazism it's the alt-right.
266480	271280	Tradwives the new trend for submissive women has a dark heart in history.
271280	275280	A certain kind of housewife has found social media and is airing the details
275280	278560	of their fight with feminism but maybe they should tone it down a
278560	282400	notch. Oh really? So you crazies can post the most ridiculous
282400	286480	bullshit on twitter the most radicalized insane propaganda
286480	288480	calling for the deaths of your political opponents
288480	292080	calling for violent revolution against capitalism and the putting down of
292080	295440	counter-revolutionary elements within society but when a woman says
295440	298640	she wants to stay at home and make a cake or something
298640	302560	now you've gone too far on the internet. Holy shit.
302560	306080	Rather awkwardly for the British tradwives who like to suggest their
306080	308960	movement is just about dressing in a Kath Kidston
308960	312320	and letting their husband choose where they're going on holiday in the U.S.
312320	315440	and elsewhere it is very much part of the alt-right movement.
315440	319360	It is especially popular among white supremacists who are extremely down with
319360	322320	the message that white women should submit to their husband and focus on
322320	326560	making as many white babies as possible. British tradwives insist this has
326560	330400	nothing to do with them. Some even said this type of housewife
330400	334080	was promoted by the third reich and it's like really? I didn't even know
334080	337040	that. Yeah and Stalin and the communists also promoted
337040	340480	the the births of the working class as well. This is
340480	344000	not something unique to fucking Hitler and Nazism.
344000	347680	You know that Hitler was a vegetarian right and he liked dogs?
347680	351040	Are we suddenly going to ban vegetables and butcher all dogs in the street?
351040	355280	Is that where we're going with this? It is not a Nazi thing to promote healthy
355280	359200	families. It's a civilization surviving thing. Oh
359200	362160	hey Mike Struckberry. How long until your girl cheats on you?
362160	365840	What are you doing laundering the tradwife thing? It's almost entirely
365840	368880	associated with far-right groups and activists. I like
368960	372160	how it's laundering now. If someone you dislike has a little
372160	375440	thing, even if that thing is literally the family unit,
375440	379120	to promote that in any kind of positive light, even if there's actual
379120	382800	positivity to be found there, is laundering it. The whole tradwife
382800	385760	thing was only a reality for a narrow middle-class group.
385760	389040	The vast majority of women worked, the work just wasn't valued.
389040	393680	There's actually some some point to this. I do know that back when the 1950s style
393680	397440	housewife was was in full swing there were a lot of poor women who just
397440	400080	couldn't afford to do that. There wasn't enough money floating
400080	402400	around in the household so they had to get jobs too. But this is where the
402400	406560	feminists got it wrong. Staying at home and caring for the house
406560	409840	and raising a family, that was a privilege. It was not an
409840	412720	oppression. Women were not oppressed when they did that. Well maybe some of them
412720	415520	were. I'm sure there were cases where some women just
415520	418160	weren't cut out for that sort of thing and didn't want to do it and they were
418160	422400	forced into it. But most women, it was a luxury
422400	425600	to not have to work outside the home. Because working outside the home, unless
425600	428640	you're like doing something exceptional, it sucks.
428640	431680	And that whole the work just wasn't valued thing. Well
431680	435680	one, when poor women worked outside the house they got paid. So it was obviously
435680	437920	valued at something. And two, there has been this other
437920	440400	movement going around for a few years now
440400	444400	where women who are housewives say that they should be paid these certain wages
444400	448160	for doing all of these these various household chores for the man.
448160	451680	And it's like well that is what your your work would be valued if you were
451680	454160	getting paid. Fair enough because you know work work
454160	457280	done domestically it's still real work and it still has value.
457280	460800	But the reason that you're not paid is because the man is not your boss and
460800	462800	he's not hiring you. You're working together as a team.
462800	466560	Nobody pays me when I do my own dishes and nor do I expect it to be paid. It's
466560	469520	what you do to have a life. And that isn't the only problem with the
469520	471520	whole trad wife thing. There are some other ones.
471520	474960	I have an article out next month on the increasing expectations of financial
474960	478160	independence on divorce. Anyone who thinks being a trad wife
478160	482400	sounds good, it's not quite as good if you get divorced 15 years down the line
482400	485760	and have a limited earning capacity. I agree if you're basically going to be
485760	490080	completely submitting to somebody else and therefore you you you lose years of
490080	492400	your life in the job market and then then you're
492400	494800	you're behind in your experience you're behind in your training you're behind
494800	498160	in your schooling sometimes. And then the relationship falls apart.
498160	501680	You are in a terrible situation and I don't know maybe depending on who you
501680	504720	are and what your relationship is you shouldn't be putting all your eggs in
504720	508880	that basket. But at the same time this trad wife thing it is obviously for
508880	512480	people who are already stable. Like if you're not in a stable
512480	515840	relationship already doing this thinking it's going to get
515840	518640	better you know it might actually just make your situation worse.
518640	523120	But again that doesn't make trad wife itself invalid for people to desire.
523120	526400	But no it's it's all just white supremacy. It's all just
526400	530720	trans hating gender criticalism. It's all just something that should be in the
530720	533360	past. It's all just impeding the advancement of women.
533360	536640	If this is your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it.
536640	540480	But the trad wife movement is clearly linked to far-right ideologies born in
540480	543200	2016 to help white supremacists with their
543200	547040	lack of women. Yeah the thing is when you get like incel types who
547040	549760	actually experience a lack of women in their lives
549760	553200	a traditional woman won't help them. Because a traditional woman will want
553200	557840	but also require a traditional man to to upkeep the relationship.
557840	561840	And incels you know for for better or worse don't seem to be able
561840	566000	to perform those functions. Because those functions include things that incels
566000	568720	generally don't have like the ability to not be bitter all the
568720	572800	time about your current life situation. The ability to constantly self-improve in
572800	575360	the face of hardship. Incels might be crying about the lack of
575360	578640	traditional women but the very act of going on subreddits and crying about it
578640	580560	is not something that a traditional man would do.
580560	583760	But here's the really interesting part about this whole situation. If this is
583760	587600	your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it. Maybe for
587600	591120	some people it is a kink or a fetish. Maybe for some people it is it is like a
591120	595920	non-sexual thing and they just want to to have that life. Either way
595920	599200	this sentence implies that regardless of whatever pressures
599200	601440	social justice is putting on the situation
601440	604000	if you truly want this then you should be able to do it. And that seems
604000	606720	reasonable to me. But then you get things like this.
606720	610000	I said I wanted to be a wife and a mum. The teacher laughed at me.
610000	614000	Tradwife is a growing movement of women who promote ultra-traditional gender
614000	616640	roles. She says it's feminist as she's choosing
616640	620800	what she wants to do. This sentence is almost written as if
620800	625120	it's not feminist but this person is falsely claiming as if it is.
625120	628960	And that does seem to be the position of radical feminism right now. This is an
628960	633760	older article but it still checks out. No feminism is not about choice written
633760	636880	in 2015 but still relevant today regarding how feminists view the
636880	640560	situation. Feminism is back in fashion. As the push
640560	644320	to claim the f-word has intensified public figures corporations and much of
644320	647520	the mainstream media have propelled a largely unchallenging version of
647520	651680	feminism into the popular consciousness. It is a feminism that never mentions
651680	654880	women's liberation instead opting for a celebration of
654880	657040	choice. First of all the choice arguments are
657040	661040	fundamentally flawed because they assume a level of unmitigated freedom for women
661040	663440	that simply doesn't exist. But the choices are shaped and
663440	666480	constrained by the unequal conditions in which we live.
666480	670480	It would only make sense to uncritically celebrate choice in a post-patriarchal
670480	672960	world. Well that just sounds like everyone
672960	676160	alive. Yes we all make choices but we all have
676160	678400	constraints on us. Like you always have to eat.
678400	681680	You always have to sleep. There are certain things that you have to do to
681680	685520	stay alive. Just because your choices are bounded by
685520	688400	those realities doesn't mean that you don't have the
688400	691600	choice. You are literally arguing against the nature of existence.
691600	695520	Second the idea that more choices automatically equate to more freedom is
695520	699040	a falsehood. That is literally what freedom is is the
699040	701920	freedom to choose to pick what you want to do with your
701920	705840	life and your time and your energy. Yes women can now work or stay at home
705840	709440	if they have children for example but this choice is fairly hollow when
709440	712240	child rearing continues to be constructed as women's work.
712240	715920	There is insufficient state support for child care and childless women are
715920	718880	decried as selfish. What you're talking about are
718880	721760	social pressures and it is very common for people who
721760	725200	truly want something unorthodox to have to fight against social
725200	728320	pressures. That is in fact part of what makes the victory of
728320	732800	achieving that thing so much more enjoyable. What you are asking for
732800	736320	is the ability to do something different
736320	740000	without the cost of doing something different. Third the focus on women's
740000	743280	choices as the be-all and end-all of feminism
743280	746080	has resulted in a perverse kind of victim blaming
746080	749200	and a distraction from the real problems women still face.
749200	753040	If you're not happy with the way things are don't blame misogyny and sexism, the
753040	756000	pay gap, entrenched gender roles, women's lack of
756000	758080	representation, or an epidemic of violence.
758080	761520	Blame yourself you made the wrong choice. This is the thing though sometimes you
761520	764080	did. The pay gap. Why do women go into fields
764080	767840	that pay less? Entrenched gender roles. Why do women
767840	771840	desire them sometimes? Women's lack of representation on boards
771840	774800	or in parliament. Why don't women do the same things that
774800	778000	men do to get into these positions? Sometimes it is the case that you should
778000	781600	blame yourself because sometimes it is the case that you made the wrong choice.
781600	785440	It is not the patriarchy when you make a mistake but no the radical feminists of
785440	789920	today have largely abandoned the idea of personal choice and it is all about
789920	792320	power politics. It's all about doing what is
792320	796320	non-traditional to fight the patriarchy and women who actually try a traditional
796320	799120	life they are traitors to the movement. Even
799120	802000	though they want that and they've actively chosen it and they're not
802000	805280	being forced. Sorry feminism is not about choice.
805280	809040	Liberal feminism asks nothing of women and delivers nothing in return.
809040	812400	But that is kind of the point because the liberals only ask to be left alone
812400	816000	to have the freedom to pursue what makes them happy and fulfilled. But a radical
816000	818880	movement can't simply leave people alone it has to
818880	821680	radicalize them. It has to take whatever beliefs they may hold,
821680	825360	reinforce the ones that fit the radicalization and purge the ones that
825360	827920	don't. Why saying it's my choice doesn't always
827920	831760	make it a feminist choice? All choices are not feminist. Many a
831760	834640	times we think having a choice and deciding something is enough to make it
834640	838560	feminist but the truth is far from this. I would go so far as to say that radical
838560	841920	feminism was never about women's choice. It was
841920	844880	always about women's radicalization. That's what makes it radical.
844880	847760	And when those articles are the propaganda here is the mindset that it
847760	850960	produces. If you are a housewife or a stay-at-home mom
850960	854960	you have no right to call yourself a feminist. You have literally surrendered
854960	859120	yourself to the patriarchy. Don't speak up for us when you're enslaved to a man.
859120	862560	Real feminists don't welcome you. Y'all are fake feminists.
862560	865920	Real feminists work. Real feminists don't get married.
865920	869440	Real feminists don't give their life to any man. Y'all disgust me.
869440	872800	If you don't think this person's been radicalized I don't know what to tell
872800	874800	you. But that's why the term is
874800	879120	radicalization. If it's all just power politics. If you can't be still on a
879120	882080	moving train then if you're not being radicalized
882080	886640	towards radical feminism then you are being radicalized towards
886640	889840	traditional life and patriarchy and the total submission
889840	895120	of all women. To the radical feminists there is no choice in feminism. There is
895120	898320	only supporting the movement as a good proper revolutionary
898320	902000	or living your life as a white supremacist regardless of your race I
902000	905520	guess. But the truth is in the choice. I'm not
905520	909760	going to sit here and and say that all women if they simply chose to be
909760	912480	trad wives would be happy. I don't think so. I think a lot of them
912480	917120	would. However I do think that there are just some people who aren't cut out for
917120	920480	traditional gender roles and that's fine. If it turns out that you are actually
920480	924080	one of those one in a million people if for some reason you actually don't
924080	926160	want kids and it would not be good for you to have them
926160	930080	or if it turns out that you're actually just 100% gay or if it turns out that
930080	932320	you'd rather not be tied down and you want to
932320	935600	travel most of your life and not really live in any single city for more for
935600	938960	more than a year or something. If it turns out that you just have a
938960	941840	different idea of what your life should be then you
941840	946240	should have the freedom to pursue that. And in the same vein if you have a
946240	948320	traditional idea of what your life should be
948320	951680	then you should have the freedom to pursue that. And I think
951680	957200	deep down if we if we think about it if we meditate on it and if we're honest
957200	960560	with ourselves we all know what kind of life we want
960560	965040	we all know what parts of traditionalism we want to incorporate into our future
965040	969440	and what parts we want to maybe let go or or de-emphasize a little bit
969440	972400	and it's gonna be different for every person. I'm willing to bet that if most
972400	976720	of those militant political lesbians sit down
976720	980880	and have the strength to be honest with themselves they'll realize that
980880	984560	you know maybe they're not actually lesbians. In the same vein I think a lot
984560	987840	of people who really desire a hardcore traditional life
987840	991120	if they sit down and meditate on a little bit and they have the fortitude
991120	994320	to be honest with themselves they'll probably realize that you know
994320	996560	there are some things about modern life that are
996560	1001040	you know a little bit better than how it was a few hundred years ago. And maybe we
1001040	1003120	shouldn't be so quick to completely expel
1003120	1006560	the modern lifestyle simply because it's new. I probably sound like a broken
1006560	1010640	record at this point but again the answer is individualism. The answer
1010640	1014080	is personal freedom. Figure out what you want in your life and
1014080	1017600	go and do it. And don't let anybody tell you that you're a counter-revolutionary
1017600	1019840	element or that you're a white supremacist because
1019840	1022800	you're you're acting traditionally. And in the same vein don't let anybody tell
1022800	1026240	you that you're a degenerate because you do something that is a bit offbeat.
1026240	1029920	Be honest with yourself and pursue whatever it is that will bring your life
1029920	1032000	meaning. And don't let anyone tell you you should
1032000	1038240	do anything else simply because of some political position. It's all bullshit.
