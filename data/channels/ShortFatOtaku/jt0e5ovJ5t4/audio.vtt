00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
The hot new term of the day is a radicalization.

00:03.040 --> 00:06.480
Just in case you couldn't tell, that's a combination of traditional and

00:06.480 --> 00:10.880
radicalization. Subsequently, to be radicalized is

00:10.880 --> 00:14.960
basically to be radicalized towards the idea of a traditional life.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.080
This is generally used in reference to tradwives.

00:18.080 --> 00:22.720
A tradwife is a specific type of wojack variant where it shows

00:22.720 --> 00:27.040
a young female wojack wearing like a blue a blue dress and she has you know

00:27.040 --> 00:29.760
long blonde hair. She's very traditional in how she looks

00:29.760 --> 00:33.760
and generally the memes revolve around her wanting to do traditional things and

00:33.760 --> 00:36.800
have a traditional life. And she's almost always contrasted in

00:36.800 --> 00:41.440
the memes with either a a soy boy male feminist

00:41.440 --> 00:45.200
or a promiscuous woman. And some of the criticism coming from the social justice

00:45.200 --> 00:49.440
warriors regarding the uh the chad yes meme and the tradwife

00:49.440 --> 00:51.760
meme as they're as they're often paired together

00:51.760 --> 00:56.160
um is actually legitimate. For example you know she she is wearing a style of

00:56.160 --> 00:58.480
clothing that is you know quite outdated

00:58.480 --> 01:02.240
meanwhile he's simply wearing a hoodie. He's not nearly as traditional at least

01:02.240 --> 01:05.360
in how he looks as she is and you can make the argument that

01:05.360 --> 01:08.240
well there's probably some kind of imbalance there that needs to be

01:08.240 --> 01:10.480
addressed. A lot of the alt-right people who want

01:10.480 --> 01:14.720
tradwives they're probably jacking it five times to trap porn every single day.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.720
But nonetheless that doesn't make the desire for a traditional style wife or

01:18.720 --> 01:22.400
to live a traditional style life um invalid. That's a perfectly reasonable

01:22.400 --> 01:25.200
thing to want for yourself and it's also a perfectly reasonable

01:25.200 --> 01:27.760
thing to not want that if that happens to be you.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.040
There are definitely people who find traditional family values you know happy

01:31.040 --> 01:34.800
and and fulfilling and wholesome and they do really want to have kids and

01:34.800 --> 01:38.080
they basically want to cultivate this this specific type of life. And then

01:38.080 --> 01:40.960
there are people who aren't cut out for that. There are people for whom

01:40.960 --> 01:43.680
the family structure might seem oppressive because they were actually

01:43.680 --> 01:46.320
abused by their parents or something. There are people who feel like they

01:46.320 --> 01:49.040
don't want to have children because that's just not their life path. But just

01:49.040 --> 01:51.280
because someone wants something that is traditional

01:51.280 --> 01:54.400
doesn't mean that they're evil. And in fact we've got this article from the

01:54.400 --> 01:58.960
BBC called why I submit to my husband like it's 1959.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.720
And the twitter intro to this article is is quite interesting. We'll introduce you

02:02.720 --> 02:05.280
to a tradwife a young woman who has chosen to be a

02:05.280 --> 02:08.240
traditional wife staying at home to take care of the household chores while her

02:08.240 --> 02:10.960
husband works and she is fine with submitting to her

02:10.960 --> 02:13.840
husband as he makes the key decisions in their lives.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.880
And the actual story itself is literally just like

02:16.880 --> 02:20.400
a look into the life of somebody who lives like this and it's not all that

02:20.400 --> 02:23.120
interesting because I think we all know how people like this live at least on

02:23.120 --> 02:26.160
some level. But the blowback that this got was

02:26.160 --> 02:29.440
incredible. Who needs youtube rabbit holes when you

02:29.440 --> 02:33.440
have the BBC broadcasting literal white supremacist

02:33.440 --> 02:37.920
propaganda? You know you know race isn't really a

02:37.920 --> 02:40.560
factor in terms of the story behind that article.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.000
And you really have to wonder what kind of headspace you're in when you think

02:44.000 --> 02:47.280
that like your mother making you breakfast before

02:47.280 --> 02:50.560
she brings you to school or your mother making you dinner after you come home

02:50.560 --> 02:53.680
or that the woman doing any kind of domestic work at all

02:53.680 --> 02:57.680
that that's white supremacy. I've heard the argument that it's anti-feminist now

02:57.680 --> 03:02.240
for for at least 20 years but white supremacy? What happens to all

03:02.240 --> 03:05.920
of those various families who um who are made up of non-white women who

03:05.920 --> 03:09.760
do this? What about all those muslim families where women are forced to do

03:09.760 --> 03:13.680
this? Are they white supremacist Becca?

03:13.680 --> 03:17.200
Of course keep in mind this person here Becca Lewis she was the one who

03:17.200 --> 03:20.960
who wrote Alternative Influence broadcasting the reactionary right on

03:20.960 --> 03:23.440
youtube. That ridiculous report a couple of years

03:23.440 --> 03:27.680
ago that basically branded anybody who talks to alt-right figures as

03:27.680 --> 03:31.680
alt-right themselves. Like Ben Shapiro the notorious white supremacist

03:31.680 --> 03:35.440
Jew or Joe Rogan or Sargon or or any of these other people

03:35.440 --> 03:38.800
that are all just alt-right according to this person. However Becca did feel a

03:38.800 --> 03:42.240
need to explain her position. For those in my comments who don't seem

03:42.240 --> 03:46.720
to know so-called tradwives are white supremacist women who devote themselves

03:46.800 --> 03:50.160
to domestic duties in the service of perpetuating the

03:50.160 --> 03:53.280
white race. It is a dog whistle meant to sound less

03:53.280 --> 03:57.040
white supremacist than it is. Again what happens when a bunch of

03:57.040 --> 04:00.080
non-white women do this? I didn't know that if you take like two

04:00.080 --> 04:03.360
brown people and then they have a kid but at the same time the

04:03.360 --> 04:07.280
woman is doing household chores the kid comes out white. I guess race

04:07.280 --> 04:10.640
really is a social construct but we really have reached that point of

04:10.640 --> 04:14.400
madness where a woman who stays at home and you

04:14.400 --> 04:17.680
know vacuums or brings out the garbage or or cooks or

04:17.680 --> 04:20.160
cleans or whatever that's white supremacy now.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.280
Any form of traditionalism especially if a woman's doing it

04:23.280 --> 04:26.480
is white supremacy it's it's Nazism it's the alt-right.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.280
Tradwives the new trend for submissive women has a dark heart in history.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.280
A certain kind of housewife has found social media and is airing the details

04:35.280 --> 04:38.560
of their fight with feminism but maybe they should tone it down a

04:38.560 --> 04:42.400
notch. Oh really? So you crazies can post the most ridiculous

04:42.400 --> 04:46.480
bullshit on twitter the most radicalized insane propaganda

04:46.480 --> 04:48.480
calling for the deaths of your political opponents

04:48.480 --> 04:52.080
calling for violent revolution against capitalism and the putting down of

04:52.080 --> 04:55.440
counter-revolutionary elements within society but when a woman says

04:55.440 --> 04:58.640
she wants to stay at home and make a cake or something

04:58.640 --> 05:02.560
now you've gone too far on the internet. Holy shit.

05:02.560 --> 05:06.080
Rather awkwardly for the British tradwives who like to suggest their

05:06.080 --> 05:08.960
movement is just about dressing in a Kath Kidston

05:08.960 --> 05:12.320
and letting their husband choose where they're going on holiday in the U.S.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.440
and elsewhere it is very much part of the alt-right movement.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.360
It is especially popular among white supremacists who are extremely down with

05:19.360 --> 05:22.320
the message that white women should submit to their husband and focus on

05:22.320 --> 05:26.560
making as many white babies as possible. British tradwives insist this has

05:26.560 --> 05:30.400
nothing to do with them. Some even said this type of housewife

05:30.400 --> 05:34.080
was promoted by the third reich and it's like really? I didn't even know

05:34.080 --> 05:37.040
that. Yeah and Stalin and the communists also promoted

05:37.040 --> 05:40.480
the the births of the working class as well. This is

05:40.480 --> 05:44.000
not something unique to fucking Hitler and Nazism.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.680
You know that Hitler was a vegetarian right and he liked dogs?

05:47.680 --> 05:51.040
Are we suddenly going to ban vegetables and butcher all dogs in the street?

05:51.040 --> 05:55.280
Is that where we're going with this? It is not a Nazi thing to promote healthy

05:55.280 --> 05:59.200
families. It's a civilization surviving thing. Oh

05:59.200 --> 06:02.160
hey Mike Struckberry. How long until your girl cheats on you?

06:02.160 --> 06:05.840
What are you doing laundering the tradwife thing? It's almost entirely

06:05.840 --> 06:08.880
associated with far-right groups and activists. I like

06:08.960 --> 06:12.160
how it's laundering now. If someone you dislike has a little

06:12.160 --> 06:15.440
thing, even if that thing is literally the family unit,

06:15.440 --> 06:19.120
to promote that in any kind of positive light, even if there's actual

06:19.120 --> 06:22.800
positivity to be found there, is laundering it. The whole tradwife

06:22.800 --> 06:25.760
thing was only a reality for a narrow middle-class group.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.040
The vast majority of women worked, the work just wasn't valued.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.680
There's actually some some point to this. I do know that back when the 1950s style

06:33.680 --> 06:37.440
housewife was was in full swing there were a lot of poor women who just

06:37.440 --> 06:40.080
couldn't afford to do that. There wasn't enough money floating

06:40.080 --> 06:42.400
around in the household so they had to get jobs too. But this is where the

06:42.400 --> 06:46.560
feminists got it wrong. Staying at home and caring for the house

06:46.560 --> 06:49.840
and raising a family, that was a privilege. It was not an

06:49.840 --> 06:52.720
oppression. Women were not oppressed when they did that. Well maybe some of them

06:52.720 --> 06:55.520
were. I'm sure there were cases where some women just

06:55.520 --> 06:58.160
weren't cut out for that sort of thing and didn't want to do it and they were

06:58.160 --> 07:02.400
forced into it. But most women, it was a luxury

07:02.400 --> 07:05.600
to not have to work outside the home. Because working outside the home, unless

07:05.600 --> 07:08.640
you're like doing something exceptional, it sucks.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.680
And that whole the work just wasn't valued thing. Well

07:11.680 --> 07:15.680
one, when poor women worked outside the house they got paid. So it was obviously

07:15.680 --> 07:17.920
valued at something. And two, there has been this other

07:17.920 --> 07:20.400
movement going around for a few years now

07:20.400 --> 07:24.400
where women who are housewives say that they should be paid these certain wages

07:24.400 --> 07:28.160
for doing all of these these various household chores for the man.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.680
And it's like well that is what your your work would be valued if you were

07:31.680 --> 07:34.160
getting paid. Fair enough because you know work work

07:34.160 --> 07:37.280
done domestically it's still real work and it still has value.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.800
But the reason that you're not paid is because the man is not your boss and

07:40.800 --> 07:42.800
he's not hiring you. You're working together as a team.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.560
Nobody pays me when I do my own dishes and nor do I expect it to be paid. It's

07:46.560 --> 07:49.520
what you do to have a life. And that isn't the only problem with the

07:49.520 --> 07:51.520
whole trad wife thing. There are some other ones.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.960
I have an article out next month on the increasing expectations of financial

07:54.960 --> 07:58.160
independence on divorce. Anyone who thinks being a trad wife

07:58.160 --> 08:02.400
sounds good, it's not quite as good if you get divorced 15 years down the line

08:02.400 --> 08:05.760
and have a limited earning capacity. I agree if you're basically going to be

08:05.760 --> 08:10.080
completely submitting to somebody else and therefore you you you lose years of

08:10.080 --> 08:12.400
your life in the job market and then then you're

08:12.400 --> 08:14.800
you're behind in your experience you're behind in your training you're behind

08:14.800 --> 08:18.160
in your schooling sometimes. And then the relationship falls apart.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.680
You are in a terrible situation and I don't know maybe depending on who you

08:21.680 --> 08:24.720
are and what your relationship is you shouldn't be putting all your eggs in

08:24.720 --> 08:28.880
that basket. But at the same time this trad wife thing it is obviously for

08:28.880 --> 08:32.480
people who are already stable. Like if you're not in a stable

08:32.480 --> 08:35.840
relationship already doing this thinking it's going to get

08:35.840 --> 08:38.640
better you know it might actually just make your situation worse.

08:38.640 --> 08:43.120
But again that doesn't make trad wife itself invalid for people to desire.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.400
But no it's it's all just white supremacy. It's all just

08:46.400 --> 08:50.720
trans hating gender criticalism. It's all just something that should be in the

08:50.720 --> 08:53.360
past. It's all just impeding the advancement of women.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.640
If this is your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.480
But the trad wife movement is clearly linked to far-right ideologies born in

09:00.480 --> 09:03.200
2016 to help white supremacists with their

09:03.200 --> 09:07.040
lack of women. Yeah the thing is when you get like incel types who

09:07.040 --> 09:09.760
actually experience a lack of women in their lives

09:09.760 --> 09:13.200
a traditional woman won't help them. Because a traditional woman will want

09:13.200 --> 09:17.840
but also require a traditional man to to upkeep the relationship.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.840
And incels you know for for better or worse don't seem to be able

09:21.840 --> 09:26.000
to perform those functions. Because those functions include things that incels

09:26.000 --> 09:28.720
generally don't have like the ability to not be bitter all the

09:28.720 --> 09:32.800
time about your current life situation. The ability to constantly self-improve in

09:32.800 --> 09:35.360
the face of hardship. Incels might be crying about the lack of

09:35.360 --> 09:38.640
traditional women but the very act of going on subreddits and crying about it

09:38.640 --> 09:40.560
is not something that a traditional man would do.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.760
But here's the really interesting part about this whole situation. If this is

09:43.760 --> 09:47.600
your fetish or kink or lifestyle then go for it. Maybe for

09:47.600 --> 09:51.120
some people it is a kink or a fetish. Maybe for some people it is it is like a

09:51.120 --> 09:55.920
non-sexual thing and they just want to to have that life. Either way

09:55.920 --> 09:59.200
this sentence implies that regardless of whatever pressures

09:59.200 --> 10:01.440
social justice is putting on the situation

10:01.440 --> 10:04.000
if you truly want this then you should be able to do it. And that seems

10:04.000 --> 10:06.720
reasonable to me. But then you get things like this.

10:06.720 --> 10:10.000
I said I wanted to be a wife and a mum. The teacher laughed at me.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Tradwife is a growing movement of women who promote ultra-traditional gender

10:14.000 --> 10:16.640
roles. She says it's feminist as she's choosing

10:16.640 --> 10:20.800
what she wants to do. This sentence is almost written as if

10:20.800 --> 10:25.120
it's not feminist but this person is falsely claiming as if it is.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.960
And that does seem to be the position of radical feminism right now. This is an

10:28.960 --> 10:33.760
older article but it still checks out. No feminism is not about choice written

10:33.760 --> 10:36.880
in 2015 but still relevant today regarding how feminists view the

10:36.880 --> 10:40.560
situation. Feminism is back in fashion. As the push

10:40.560 --> 10:44.320
to claim the f-word has intensified public figures corporations and much of

10:44.320 --> 10:47.520
the mainstream media have propelled a largely unchallenging version of

10:47.520 --> 10:51.680
feminism into the popular consciousness. It is a feminism that never mentions

10:51.680 --> 10:54.880
women's liberation instead opting for a celebration of

10:54.880 --> 10:57.040
choice. First of all the choice arguments are

10:57.040 --> 11:01.040
fundamentally flawed because they assume a level of unmitigated freedom for women

11:01.040 --> 11:03.440
that simply doesn't exist. But the choices are shaped and

11:03.440 --> 11:06.480
constrained by the unequal conditions in which we live.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.480
It would only make sense to uncritically celebrate choice in a post-patriarchal

11:10.480 --> 11:12.960
world. Well that just sounds like everyone

11:12.960 --> 11:16.160
alive. Yes we all make choices but we all have

11:16.160 --> 11:18.400
constraints on us. Like you always have to eat.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.680
You always have to sleep. There are certain things that you have to do to

11:21.680 --> 11:25.520
stay alive. Just because your choices are bounded by

11:25.520 --> 11:28.400
those realities doesn't mean that you don't have the

11:28.400 --> 11:31.600
choice. You are literally arguing against the nature of existence.

11:31.600 --> 11:35.520
Second the idea that more choices automatically equate to more freedom is

11:35.520 --> 11:39.040
a falsehood. That is literally what freedom is is the

11:39.040 --> 11:41.920
freedom to choose to pick what you want to do with your

11:41.920 --> 11:45.840
life and your time and your energy. Yes women can now work or stay at home

11:45.840 --> 11:49.440
if they have children for example but this choice is fairly hollow when

11:49.440 --> 11:52.240
child rearing continues to be constructed as women's work.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.920
There is insufficient state support for child care and childless women are

11:55.920 --> 11:58.880
decried as selfish. What you're talking about are

11:58.880 --> 12:01.760
social pressures and it is very common for people who

12:01.760 --> 12:05.200
truly want something unorthodox to have to fight against social

12:05.200 --> 12:08.320
pressures. That is in fact part of what makes the victory of

12:08.320 --> 12:12.800
achieving that thing so much more enjoyable. What you are asking for

12:12.800 --> 12:16.320
is the ability to do something different

12:16.320 --> 12:20.000
without the cost of doing something different. Third the focus on women's

12:20.000 --> 12:23.280
choices as the be-all and end-all of feminism

12:23.280 --> 12:26.080
has resulted in a perverse kind of victim blaming

12:26.080 --> 12:29.200
and a distraction from the real problems women still face.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.040
If you're not happy with the way things are don't blame misogyny and sexism, the

12:33.040 --> 12:36.000
pay gap, entrenched gender roles, women's lack of

12:36.000 --> 12:38.080
representation, or an epidemic of violence.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.520
Blame yourself you made the wrong choice. This is the thing though sometimes you

12:41.520 --> 12:44.080
did. The pay gap. Why do women go into fields

12:44.080 --> 12:47.840
that pay less? Entrenched gender roles. Why do women

12:47.840 --> 12:51.840
desire them sometimes? Women's lack of representation on boards

12:51.840 --> 12:54.800
or in parliament. Why don't women do the same things that

12:54.800 --> 12:58.000
men do to get into these positions? Sometimes it is the case that you should

12:58.000 --> 13:01.600
blame yourself because sometimes it is the case that you made the wrong choice.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.440
It is not the patriarchy when you make a mistake but no the radical feminists of

13:05.440 --> 13:09.920
today have largely abandoned the idea of personal choice and it is all about

13:09.920 --> 13:12.320
power politics. It's all about doing what is

13:12.320 --> 13:16.320
non-traditional to fight the patriarchy and women who actually try a traditional

13:16.320 --> 13:19.120
life they are traitors to the movement. Even

13:19.120 --> 13:22.000
though they want that and they've actively chosen it and they're not

13:22.000 --> 13:25.280
being forced. Sorry feminism is not about choice.

13:25.280 --> 13:29.040
Liberal feminism asks nothing of women and delivers nothing in return.

13:29.040 --> 13:32.400
But that is kind of the point because the liberals only ask to be left alone

13:32.400 --> 13:36.000
to have the freedom to pursue what makes them happy and fulfilled. But a radical

13:36.000 --> 13:38.880
movement can't simply leave people alone it has to

13:38.880 --> 13:41.680
radicalize them. It has to take whatever beliefs they may hold,

13:41.680 --> 13:45.360
reinforce the ones that fit the radicalization and purge the ones that

13:45.360 --> 13:47.920
don't. Why saying it's my choice doesn't always

13:47.920 --> 13:51.760
make it a feminist choice? All choices are not feminist. Many a

13:51.760 --> 13:54.640
times we think having a choice and deciding something is enough to make it

13:54.640 --> 13:58.560
feminist but the truth is far from this. I would go so far as to say that radical

13:58.560 --> 14:01.920
feminism was never about women's choice. It was

14:01.920 --> 14:04.880
always about women's radicalization. That's what makes it radical.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.760
And when those articles are the propaganda here is the mindset that it

14:07.760 --> 14:10.960
produces. If you are a housewife or a stay-at-home mom

14:10.960 --> 14:14.960
you have no right to call yourself a feminist. You have literally surrendered

14:14.960 --> 14:19.120
yourself to the patriarchy. Don't speak up for us when you're enslaved to a man.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.560
Real feminists don't welcome you. Y'all are fake feminists.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.920
Real feminists work. Real feminists don't get married.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.440
Real feminists don't give their life to any man. Y'all disgust me.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.800
If you don't think this person's been radicalized I don't know what to tell

14:32.800 --> 14:34.800
you. But that's why the term is

14:34.800 --> 14:39.120
radicalization. If it's all just power politics. If you can't be still on a

14:39.120 --> 14:42.080
moving train then if you're not being radicalized

14:42.080 --> 14:46.640
towards radical feminism then you are being radicalized towards

14:46.640 --> 14:49.840
traditional life and patriarchy and the total submission

14:49.840 --> 14:55.120
of all women. To the radical feminists there is no choice in feminism. There is

14:55.120 --> 14:58.320
only supporting the movement as a good proper revolutionary

14:58.320 --> 15:02.000
or living your life as a white supremacist regardless of your race I

15:02.000 --> 15:05.520
guess. But the truth is in the choice. I'm not

15:05.520 --> 15:09.760
going to sit here and and say that all women if they simply chose to be

15:09.760 --> 15:12.480
trad wives would be happy. I don't think so. I think a lot of them

15:12.480 --> 15:17.120
would. However I do think that there are just some people who aren't cut out for

15:17.120 --> 15:20.480
traditional gender roles and that's fine. If it turns out that you are actually

15:20.480 --> 15:24.080
one of those one in a million people if for some reason you actually don't

15:24.080 --> 15:26.160
want kids and it would not be good for you to have them

15:26.160 --> 15:30.080
or if it turns out that you're actually just 100% gay or if it turns out that

15:30.080 --> 15:32.320
you'd rather not be tied down and you want to

15:32.320 --> 15:35.600
travel most of your life and not really live in any single city for more for

15:35.600 --> 15:38.960
more than a year or something. If it turns out that you just have a

15:38.960 --> 15:41.840
different idea of what your life should be then you

15:41.840 --> 15:46.240
should have the freedom to pursue that. And in the same vein if you have a

15:46.240 --> 15:48.320
traditional idea of what your life should be

15:48.320 --> 15:51.680
then you should have the freedom to pursue that. And I think

15:51.680 --> 15:57.200
deep down if we if we think about it if we meditate on it and if we're honest

15:57.200 --> 16:00.560
with ourselves we all know what kind of life we want

16:00.560 --> 16:05.040
we all know what parts of traditionalism we want to incorporate into our future

16:05.040 --> 16:09.440
and what parts we want to maybe let go or or de-emphasize a little bit

16:09.440 --> 16:12.400
and it's gonna be different for every person. I'm willing to bet that if most

16:12.400 --> 16:16.720
of those militant political lesbians sit down

16:16.720 --> 16:20.880
and have the strength to be honest with themselves they'll realize that

16:20.880 --> 16:24.560
you know maybe they're not actually lesbians. In the same vein I think a lot

16:24.560 --> 16:27.840
of people who really desire a hardcore traditional life

16:27.840 --> 16:31.120
if they sit down and meditate on a little bit and they have the fortitude

16:31.120 --> 16:34.320
to be honest with themselves they'll probably realize that you know

16:34.320 --> 16:36.560
there are some things about modern life that are

16:36.560 --> 16:41.040
you know a little bit better than how it was a few hundred years ago. And maybe we

16:41.040 --> 16:43.120
shouldn't be so quick to completely expel

16:43.120 --> 16:46.560
the modern lifestyle simply because it's new. I probably sound like a broken

16:46.560 --> 16:50.640
record at this point but again the answer is individualism. The answer

16:50.640 --> 16:54.080
is personal freedom. Figure out what you want in your life and

16:54.080 --> 16:57.600
go and do it. And don't let anybody tell you that you're a counter-revolutionary

16:57.600 --> 16:59.840
element or that you're a white supremacist because

16:59.840 --> 17:02.800
you're you're acting traditionally. And in the same vein don't let anybody tell

17:02.800 --> 17:06.240
you that you're a degenerate because you do something that is a bit offbeat.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.920
Be honest with yourself and pursue whatever it is that will bring your life

17:09.920 --> 17:12.000
meaning. And don't let anyone tell you you should

17:12.000 --> 17:18.240
do anything else simply because of some political position. It's all bullshit.
