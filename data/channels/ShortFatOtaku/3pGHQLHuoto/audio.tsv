0	16280	Well, I had intended this to be a dumping with Scrump, but when I sat down to record
16280	19560	it my internet went out, so I guess I'll just have to do it live.
19560	21960	And by live I mean the opposite of live.
21960	23000	Sorry, Scrump.
23000	27360	But speaking of claiming to do something live, but actually not, let's talk about Bully
27360	28360	Hunters.
28360	45880	Oh boy, this sounds like a show I want to watch.
45880	47800	This sounds like a channel I want to follow.
47800	72880	Tell me more.
72880	76700	While our casual gamers are playing, they may experience harassment.
76700	78880	When that happens, we'll be alerted.
78880	81020	They'll also call on a Bully Hunter.
81020	86900	A Bully Hunter will jump into their game and take on harassment head on.
86900	89380	They'll hunt down and take out the perpetrator.
89380	91100	You heard that correctly.
91100	95340	Bully Hunters will get these harassers where it hurts them the most, by beating bullies
95340	95780	at their own game.
95780	110260	This is a type of harassment that over 21 million female gamers have experienced.
110260	113700	It was at this moment when we saw that it was not just trash talking.
113700	115480	It was straight up harassment.
115480	119460	So that's when the Rose Thorn, our casual gamer, decided to call on one of our Bully
119460	120460	Hunters.
120460	124380	What the Rose Thorn did in this case was use our new tool on her mobile device.
124380	127020	It says our Bully Hunter has just entered the game.
127020	130300	See, Bully Hunter 77 has joined the game.
130300	134680	Now our victim, the Rose Thorn, and our Bully Hunter can communicate with one another.
134680	137420	Now you see there, the tool connected these two.
137420	139180	A victim with a Bully Hunter.
139180	144460	Okay, so now Bully Hunter 77 knows the name of the harasser and she is ready to take action.
144460	149100	Now we are going to switch over to Bully Hunter 77's screen to watch the hunt.
149100	152040	And it looks like she's going to use her knife, folks, and there it is.
152040	153460	Just pause right there.
153460	155780	Let's back up and see that again.
155780	160660	A brilliant knife move.
160660	161660	Very difficult.
161660	162660	And look right there.
162660	167220	See, in the lower left hand corner, let's pause that and zoom into that.
167220	171020	Our Bully Hunter left the calling card message to the harasser.
171020	172460	Harassment is not a game.
172460	178960	Bully Hunters dot org.
178960	180060	So let me get this straight.
180060	184380	You've gathered together a bunch of female gamers who are just casually playing CSGO,
184380	187820	having a good time, and waiting for a dude on the other end to shit talk them.
187820	191980	Once this happens, one of your Bully Hunter pro gamers will join the game, kill them in
191980	196160	the game, and then leave a message in the chat saying, harassment is not bullying.
196160	197160	Bully Hunters dot org.
197160	202100	Okay, okay, before we get into just how pants on head retarded this idea is, let's take
202100	204460	a look at the pure logistical problems involved.
204460	208100	One, there's already block and report buttons in CSGO.
208100	210860	If you don't want to hear an asshole in the game, you don't have to.
210860	215420	Two, CSGO is a team based shooter, meaning you're only able to hear the voice chat
215420	217100	of people on your own team.
217100	220680	If an enemy is angry with you, you can't hear his voice taunts.
220680	224840	If a teammate is yelling at you over voice chat, and you call a Bully Hunter in, this
224840	229620	Hunter would have to join the opposing team in order to hunt your harassing teammate down,
229620	232580	making it very likely they'd kill you in the crossfire.
232580	236900	Three, this won't work if a CSGO match is already full, or if you're playing the game
236900	237900	in competitive.
237900	241340	Because new people won't be allowed to join the match in either of those scenarios.
241340	245460	Four, getting other people to fight a bully for you not only would make the bully more
245460	248500	likely to continue targeting you, it's also some weak ass shit.
248500	252220	Why not get better at the game and kill them yourself, rather than calling your big brother
252220	253220	over?
253220	256100	If you actually use this tool, you deserve to be shit on at that point.
256100	259740	Five, how well do you think your service is actually going to function when the internet
259740	264280	clues into what you're doing and clogs the Bully Hunter request queue up with bullshit?
264280	268460	Or alternatively, fills the Bully Hunter application queue up with fake applicants.
268460	273160	Or even worse, when one of these fake applicants manages to slip in, become a Hunter, and trolls
273160	274160	the entire service.
274160	277560	But you know, there was something odd about the actual show itself, wasn't there?
277560	280880	I don't know, it didn't seem quite right, like everything was staged instead of being
280880	281880	a live production.
281880	293040	They'd show the casual gamers playing, say something like cut to her feed, and it would
293040	294880	be a completely different location on the map.
294880	300000	And then when that one casual player, TheRoseThorns, called in BullyHunter77, it all moved a bit
300000	301240	too smoothly, didn't it?
301240	305400	I guess that's to be expected, since it turns out that they were the same fucking person.
305400	309520	The history logs of TheRoseThorns' steen account shows that it's also recently gone by the
309520	313700	name of BullyHunter77, as well as BullyHunters89 and 3.
313700	314880	It was all a fake.
314880	317560	But despite that, there were still some pretty serious claims made.
317560	345520	Three
345520	347360	million women harassed in gaming.
347360	348360	It's no laughing matter.
348360	351000	Let's look into these statistics a bit more to see if we can get into the real deal.
351000	355520	PlatinumParagon, a researcher and PhD student, published a blog post breaking down the numbers
355520	357740	presented during the BullyHunters broadcast.
357740	361040	Around 3 million women have stopped playing games altogether because of harassment.
361040	366220	The source for this is a 2012 survey of 874 participants, extrapolated to every single
366220	368040	console owning women in America.
368040	371720	This means that what was previously around 3 million women have stopped playing games
371720	376400	altogether because of harassment is actually 84 women stopped playing one online game because
376400	377400	of harassment.
377400	381800	While I deeply feel for these women, this is a false, dishonest, and huge stretch in
381800	386740	the data in what has been uncovered to be a marketing campaign for SteelSeries headsets.
386740	389920	False mental health statistics are being pushed to sell you gamer gear.
389920	391760	To this I have three things to say.
391760	392760	1.
392760	393760	You are right.
393760	397480	874 participants is a decent participant pool to extrapolate from.
397480	398480	2.
398480	400140	The extrapolation was made incorrectly for hyperbole.
400140	404920	What was women quitting one game became women being pushed out of games entirely, with the
404920	409320	use of have stopped playing games altogether from ZombieUnicorn, the host.
409320	410320	3.
410320	413900	The worst crime is that the extrapolation as a whole was done incorrectly.
413900	416940	Extrapolation is a good thing because things like random sampling allow us to make inferences
416940	421040	about patterns of illness and behavior without sampling the entire population, but when we
421040	425780	extrapolate we make very very very clear that we are extrapolating, otherwise we are quite
425780	427840	simply lying and reporting fake data.
427840	430780	The extrapolation was applied only to American women who own a console.
430780	435220	This is a methodological flaw as not only are female PC gamers left out, but it is arguably
435220	438820	easier to harass somebody on a PC due to the increased likelihood of having a keyboard
438820	439820	at your fingertips.
439820	443260	And I would just like to personally add to this, the entire Bully Hunter premise revolves
443260	447740	around PC gaming, from the Bully Hunter site, to Steam integration, to CSGO.
447740	450780	I think we should take a look at this 2012 study for ourselves.
450780	454020	Maybe a closer look at the raw data will shed some light in this situation.
454020	458480	Well it turns out that it's actually a student project, written and researched by Emily Matthew.
458480	462560	This wasn't a peer reviewed university funded piece of academic literature, this was a class
462560	465600	project later published on pricecharting.com.
465600	470240	Emily Matthew actually posted the results of her project over on reddit at r slash girl
470240	472440	gamers, and replied to some criticism there as well.
472440	475500	I've never done a survey like this before, so that's something that I'll have to consider
475500	476500	in the future.
476500	479760	Well shit, this seems like a real professional piece of work, doesn't it?
479760	483040	Certainly something the Bully Hunters should use as a cornerstone of their entire operation,
483040	484040	right?
484040	487160	Imagine handing in a bullshit high school essay or something, and then realizing five
487160	491040	years later, some marketing company found it and turned into the basis for an online
491040	492040	train wreck.
492040	493240	Oh, and Emily?
493240	497100	If you've been trying and failing for the past 12 years to get that Bachelors of English,
497100	500240	like it says on your resume, maybe you should look at doing something else with your life.
500240	505280	I mean, in that time span, I attended school, took a break from school, worked a real job
505280	510260	for a little while, went back to school, completed a degree, and worked most of my way through
510260	511400	a second one.
511400	512400	Just saying.
512400	516680	In any case, in trying to find the source for these statistics, PlatinumParagon actually
516680	519520	ran into a wall, the show's host, ZombieUnicorn.
519520	523160	I searched for such a study during my lunch break and could not find even a crumb of such
523160	524160	a study.
524160	526320	Desperate to find out more, I politely asked for a citation.
526320	529020	She refused, telling me to watch the stream for the source.
529020	532180	I genuinely did not have time to watch the stream for one source, so I recalled that
532180	533480	she had rehearsed for the event.
533480	536520	If she rehearsed, she would know the name of the psychologist speaking about the data.
536520	539680	Once again, I politely asked for anyone I could contact to discuss a large scale and
539680	540680	amazing study.
540680	542120	I was told to watch the VOD.
542120	543920	Well that does seem a bit shady, doesn't it?
544160	547840	I mean, the other show's host, Tien Tran, has completely locked down her online profile,
547840	550280	and she was a virtual unknown before the Bully Hunters.
550280	552360	So fat chance of her finding out what her deal is.
552360	554680	But ZombieUnicorn has been all over the internet for years.
554680	557680	I'm sure she has a long history of standing up to bullying and harassment, right?
557680	576440	Oh wait, she has the exact opposite of that.
576440	580800	Now, I'm not somebody who sees any issue with in-game smack talk or use of the word
580800	584240	faggot or anything like that, but if you're going to claim to stand up for bullies arm
584240	588040	and arm with oppressed female gamers, maybe you shouldn't have a history of, time and
588040	590440	time again, being a bully yourself.
590440	591600	Like this.
591600	592600	Or this.
592600	593900	Or this.
593900	594900	Or this.
594900	596080	Or this.
596080	597320	Or this.
597320	598320	Or this.
598320	599320	Or this.
599320	600320	Or this.
600320	604440	Alright, in the interest of being impartial, let's let ZombieUnicorn herself have her
604440	605720	say on the event.
605720	607440	It's only right she be allowed to speak.
607440	610560	Hold on, gotta cover up that free SteelSeries headset first.
610560	612200	Okay go ahead, you've got the floor.
612200	619400	It's based on real stuff that has happened and real examples of harassment.
619400	623720	So it's not completely- Yes, I'm sure it all really happened.
623720	626960	I mean, the show was presented as a live, currently occurring event.
626960	631000	I know you had a script and it was all fake, but in the script, it talked about how you
631000	632640	were presenting it as live.
632640	634880	The word live was in the script.
634880	640840	The statistics are real, they're just based on a smaller pool and they applied the percentages
640840	644120	to the overall population of female gamers.
644120	649040	So they're based on real statistics, but it's an extrapolation.
649040	653000	And if you check my Twitter, I have the link to the studies and the sources for all the-
653000	655760	Yes, absolutely top quality statistics there.
655760	658400	Nothing like a school project to give you the best of the best.
658400	664060	The thing about griefing is that, what that original tool thing would have been was they
664060	671340	join the game, play the game normally, and kill them once, and then say harassment's
671340	672340	not a game, and leave.
672340	677020	And nothing about that is inherently harassing or abusive or griefing, it's just playing
677020	678020	the game normally.
678020	681420	This sounds like something that any normal person would love to do, absolutely.
681420	685260	You know, I've got to work that 9 to 5, but I've got a few free hours out of my busy day,
685260	686260	what should I do?
686260	690140	Oh I know, I'll sign up to be a bully hunter and be on call, for free, to join other people's
690140	694380	games that I'm not invested in, kill somebody, promote a brand, and then bail out.
694380	702020	That's how I want to spend my evenings.
702020	705860	So hold on here for a minute, if the Bully Hunters tool was never intended to actually
705860	709060	stick around, on the one hand the upside is that I wouldn't actually be spending that
709060	710260	much of my free time.
710260	712620	But really, what was the point of all this?
712620	717340	You guys spent all this money, time, energy, production value on Bully Hunters, and for
717340	718340	what?
718540	719540	Was it intended to last?
719540	720540	Was it for the show?
720540	724140	Because honestly, the two thirds of it that I cut out was them interviewing exceptionally
724140	726620	boring talking heads spouting pop psychology.
726620	727700	So why was this all made?
727700	729460	Oh yeah, SteelSeries.
729460	730460	That was it.
730460	731700	Selling gamer junk.
731700	736740	And according to our pal Zombie here, SteelSeries was front and center in organizing Bully Hunters.
736740	739820	One of the representatives from SteelSeries was involved as a consultant.
739820	747100	They were part of the meetings and the brainstorming, and that person is also the same person that
747100	749820	connected me with FCB and this campaign.
749820	754980	So the fact that they're saying that they had nothing to do with picking the talent,
754980	757260	that's not accurate.
757260	764020	And at the same time, they did have something to do with the discussion of how this event
764020	765180	campaign would go.
765180	770420	An archived listing on MediaPost also shows an advertising agency called FCB Chicago enlisting
770420	774200	SteelSeries, the National Coalition for Women, and the Diverse Gaming Coalition to be part
774200	775200	of Bully Hunters.
775200	777600	That's not what you'll hear from SteelSeries themselves.
777600	779400	Apparently it was all the Bully Hunters fault.
779400	782560	Same with VertiGear, they put up a similar statement distancing themselves from the whole
782560	783560	thing.
783560	786180	I mean, it's not like the source code of the Bully Hunters website directly references
786180	788720	SteelSeries' involvement as a corporate sponsor, right?
788720	789960	So what's the truth here?
789960	793520	Honestly it seems like everyone is just playing a game of hot potato, slowly realizing that
793520	797240	they're all a bunch of retards who tossed a lot of money into a flaming dumpster fire
797240	800120	and they're all racing to not be the last one holding the bag.
800120	804200	SteelSeries even believes its brand was so damaged by the Bully Hunters, they're considering
804200	805200	legal action.
805200	809080	I actually understand that point of view because, I mean, I know I'm never gonna support that
809080	812840	company again, after they decided to plaster their name all over a tool that downloads
812840	816720	a bunch of data not only from your Steam account, but also your Facebook if you're logged
816720	817760	in when you use it.
817760	821960	Or how the charity they planned to give the proceeds to was Time's Up Now, an activist
821960	824180	group that advocates for women in Hollywood.
824180	825400	Great job SteelSeries.
825400	829240	Take my money, take my private info, and give that shit right to Harvey Weinstein.
829240	830240	Un-fucking-believable.
830240	832280	I have noticed something odd though.
832280	835840	All these older pictures and videos of Zombie Unicorn, they don't even seem to be the same
835840	836840	person.
836840	840120	I mean, this one girl here looks like she's about 90 pounds, while the host of Bully Hunters
840120	842240	looks like she might need to unbutton that blazer.
842240	845240	Let's dig a little bit more and see if we can confirm these two to be the same person.
845240	847560	Oh shit, she did a Playboy shoot back in the day.
847560	850960	A shoot that's only recently been deleted now that the spotlight's on her.
850960	854960	This feels kinda like a Zoe Quinn situation, doesn't it, where a young spunky gamer girl
854960	858780	does a bit of porn on the side before she hits that fucking wall of mid-thirties depression.
858780	862860	You know, Zombie, it's not inevitable that you get out of shape as you get older, despite
862860	865960	what your girlfriends tell you at the ice cream cat lady meetup.
865960	869380	Just watch what you eat and hit the gym, and you can look just like your 20-year-old self
869380	870380	again.
870380	874380	Oh, I forgot, the gym's full of those misogynist males who just don't understand a woman's
874380	875380	struggle.
875380	876380	Well, how about this?
876380	878240	I've got some corporate sponsors here in the wings.
878240	880540	Let's set up, say, Gym Hunters.
880540	885100	We'll go into gyms and act as fake spotters who drop weights on the dude bros who ruin
885100	888740	your feminine lifting experience for simply doing what is normal while at the gym.
888740	892800	I know it sounds like a stupid idea for a reality show, in fact, it might even be career
892800	894840	ending for anybody who decides to take it up.
894840	896180	That's right up your alley, isn't it?
896180	900080	Who knows, with any luck, maybe you'll even be able to make enough money to fund all those
900080	904140	lawsuits you're going to be faced with for filing false DMCAs against the entire fucking
904140	905140	internet.
905140	908460	Listen, if you didn't want people to make videos about your retarded shit, you shouldn't
908460	910440	have been a part of the retarded shit.
910440	914060	So the Bully Hunters stream ended with them checking the Twitch chatroom for feedback,
914060	918740	and afterward abruptly cutting the show early, presumably because the entire thing was swastikas
918740	921460	and ascii dicks and criparian copypasta.
921460	924980	And even though it's been just a few days, the Bully Hunters are already dead.
924980	928800	The website for the app was still running for a little while during the firestorm, albeit
928800	932580	without the corporate sponsor logos at the bottom, but as of this recording it's just
932580	933580	gone.
933580	936080	It's too bad, you know, I was really looking forward to being a Bully Hunter myself, even
936080	937580	though I was rejected from the site.
937580	941220	I guess my Steam account didn't have enough playthroughs of Life is Strange on file or
941220	942220	something.
942220	944020	But in the end we all knew it was going to end like this.
944020	948620	These morons painted a huge target on themselves, no really it was in their fucking logo, and
948620	952060	it really seems like a few stupid venture capitalists thought they could milk gamers
952060	955820	for a quick easy buck by putting together the flimsiest of causes parroted by the most
955820	959100	bit-part actors and low-rent Twitch streamers they could find.
959100	963460	For anybody who came out of this looking bad, from products to personalities, you've only
963460	986620	got yourselves to blame.
