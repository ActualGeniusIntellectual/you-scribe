1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Well, I had intended this to be a dumping with Scrump, but when I sat down to record

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,560
it my internet went out, so I guess I'll just have to do it live.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,960
And by live I mean the opposite of live.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,000
Sorry, Scrump.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,360
But speaking of claiming to do something live, but actually not, let's talk about Bully

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
Hunters.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:45,880
Oh boy, this sounds like a show I want to watch.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,800
This sounds like a channel I want to follow.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:01:12,880
Tell me more.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,700
While our casual gamers are playing, they may experience harassment.

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,880
When that happens, we'll be alerted.

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,020
They'll also call on a Bully Hunter.

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,900
A Bully Hunter will jump into their game and take on harassment head on.

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,380
They'll hunt down and take out the perpetrator.

15
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,100
You heard that correctly.

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,340
Bully Hunters will get these harassers where it hurts them the most, by beating bullies

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,780
at their own game.

18
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:50,260
This is a type of harassment that over 21 million female gamers have experienced.

19
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,700
It was at this moment when we saw that it was not just trash talking.

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,480
It was straight up harassment.

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,460
So that's when the Rose Thorn, our casual gamer, decided to call on one of our Bully

22
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,460
Hunters.

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,380
What the Rose Thorn did in this case was use our new tool on her mobile device.

24
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,020
It says our Bully Hunter has just entered the game.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,300
See, Bully Hunter 77 has joined the game.

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,680
Now our victim, the Rose Thorn, and our Bully Hunter can communicate with one another.

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,420
Now you see there, the tool connected these two.

28
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,180
A victim with a Bully Hunter.

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,460
Okay, so now Bully Hunter 77 knows the name of the harasser and she is ready to take action.

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,100
Now we are going to switch over to Bully Hunter 77's screen to watch the hunt.

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,040
And it looks like she's going to use her knife, folks, and there it is.

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,460
Just pause right there.

33
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,780
Let's back up and see that again.

34
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,660
A brilliant knife move.

35
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Very difficult.

36
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,660
And look right there.

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,220
See, in the lower left hand corner, let's pause that and zoom into that.

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,020
Our Bully Hunter left the calling card message to the harasser.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,460
Harassment is not a game.

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,960
Bully Hunters dot org.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,060
So let me get this straight.

42
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,380
You've gathered together a bunch of female gamers who are just casually playing CSGO,

43
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,820
having a good time, and waiting for a dude on the other end to shit talk them.

44
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,980
Once this happens, one of your Bully Hunter pro gamers will join the game, kill them in

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,160
the game, and then leave a message in the chat saying, harassment is not bullying.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Bully Hunters dot org.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,100
Okay, okay, before we get into just how pants on head retarded this idea is, let's take

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,460
a look at the pure logistical problems involved.

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,100
One, there's already block and report buttons in CSGO.

50
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,860
If you don't want to hear an asshole in the game, you don't have to.

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,420
Two, CSGO is a team based shooter, meaning you're only able to hear the voice chat

52
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,100
of people on your own team.

53
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,680
If an enemy is angry with you, you can't hear his voice taunts.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,840
If a teammate is yelling at you over voice chat, and you call a Bully Hunter in, this

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,620
Hunter would have to join the opposing team in order to hunt your harassing teammate down,

56
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,580
making it very likely they'd kill you in the crossfire.

57
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,900
Three, this won't work if a CSGO match is already full, or if you're playing the game

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
in competitive.

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,340
Because new people won't be allowed to join the match in either of those scenarios.

60
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,460
Four, getting other people to fight a bully for you not only would make the bully more

61
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,500
likely to continue targeting you, it's also some weak ass shit.

62
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,220
Why not get better at the game and kill them yourself, rather than calling your big brother

63
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
over?

64
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,100
If you actually use this tool, you deserve to be shit on at that point.

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,740
Five, how well do you think your service is actually going to function when the internet

66
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,280
clues into what you're doing and clogs the Bully Hunter request queue up with bullshit?

67
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,460
Or alternatively, fills the Bully Hunter application queue up with fake applicants.

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,160
Or even worse, when one of these fake applicants manages to slip in, become a Hunter, and trolls

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
the entire service.

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,560
But you know, there was something odd about the actual show itself, wasn't there?

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,880
I don't know, it didn't seem quite right, like everything was staged instead of being

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
a live production.

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:53,040
They'd show the casual gamers playing, say something like cut to her feed, and it would

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
be a completely different location on the map.

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,000
And then when that one casual player, TheRoseThorns, called in BullyHunter77, it all moved a bit

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
too smoothly, didn't it?

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,400
I guess that's to be expected, since it turns out that they were the same fucking person.

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,520
The history logs of TheRoseThorns' steen account shows that it's also recently gone by the

79
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,700
name of BullyHunter77, as well as BullyHunters89 and 3.

80
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,880
It was all a fake.

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,560
But despite that, there were still some pretty serious claims made.

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:45,520
Three

83
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
million women harassed in gaming.

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
It's no laughing matter.

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's look into these statistics a bit more to see if we can get into the real deal.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,520
PlatinumParagon, a researcher and PhD student, published a blog post breaking down the numbers

87
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,740
presented during the BullyHunters broadcast.

88
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,040
Around 3 million women have stopped playing games altogether because of harassment.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,220
The source for this is a 2012 survey of 874 participants, extrapolated to every single

90
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,040
console owning women in America.

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,720
This means that what was previously around 3 million women have stopped playing games

92
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,400
altogether because of harassment is actually 84 women stopped playing one online game because

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
of harassment.

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,800
While I deeply feel for these women, this is a false, dishonest, and huge stretch in

95
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,740
the data in what has been uncovered to be a marketing campaign for SteelSeries headsets.

96
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,920
False mental health statistics are being pushed to sell you gamer gear.

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
To this I have three things to say.

98
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
1.

99
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
You are right.

100
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,480
874 participants is a decent participant pool to extrapolate from.

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
2.

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,140
The extrapolation was made incorrectly for hyperbole.

103
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,920
What was women quitting one game became women being pushed out of games entirely, with the

104
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,320
use of have stopped playing games altogether from ZombieUnicorn, the host.

105
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
3.

106
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,900
The worst crime is that the extrapolation as a whole was done incorrectly.

107
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,940
Extrapolation is a good thing because things like random sampling allow us to make inferences

108
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,040
about patterns of illness and behavior without sampling the entire population, but when we

109
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,780
extrapolate we make very very very clear that we are extrapolating, otherwise we are quite

110
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,840
simply lying and reporting fake data.

111
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,780
The extrapolation was applied only to American women who own a console.

112
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,220
This is a methodological flaw as not only are female PC gamers left out, but it is arguably

113
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,820
easier to harass somebody on a PC due to the increased likelihood of having a keyboard

114
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,820
at your fingertips.

115
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,260
And I would just like to personally add to this, the entire Bully Hunter premise revolves

116
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,740
around PC gaming, from the Bully Hunter site, to Steam integration, to CSGO.

117
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,780
I think we should take a look at this 2012 study for ourselves.

118
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,020
Maybe a closer look at the raw data will shed some light in this situation.

119
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,480
Well it turns out that it's actually a student project, written and researched by Emily Matthew.

120
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,560
This wasn't a peer reviewed university funded piece of academic literature, this was a class

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,600
project later published on pricecharting.com.

122
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,240
Emily Matthew actually posted the results of her project over on reddit at r slash girl

123
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,440
gamers, and replied to some criticism there as well.

124
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,500
I've never done a survey like this before, so that's something that I'll have to consider

125
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
in the future.

126
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,760
Well shit, this seems like a real professional piece of work, doesn't it?

127
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,040
Certainly something the Bully Hunters should use as a cornerstone of their entire operation,

128
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
right?

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,160
Imagine handing in a bullshit high school essay or something, and then realizing five

130
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,040
years later, some marketing company found it and turned into the basis for an online

131
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
train wreck.

132
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
Oh, and Emily?

133
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,100
If you've been trying and failing for the past 12 years to get that Bachelors of English,

134
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,240
like it says on your resume, maybe you should look at doing something else with your life.

135
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
I mean, in that time span, I attended school, took a break from school, worked a real job

136
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,260
for a little while, went back to school, completed a degree, and worked most of my way through

137
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,400
a second one.

138
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Just saying.

139
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,680
In any case, in trying to find the source for these statistics, PlatinumParagon actually

140
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,520
ran into a wall, the show's host, ZombieUnicorn.

141
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,160
I searched for such a study during my lunch break and could not find even a crumb of such

142
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
a study.

143
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,320
Desperate to find out more, I politely asked for a citation.

144
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,020
She refused, telling me to watch the stream for the source.

145
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,180
I genuinely did not have time to watch the stream for one source, so I recalled that

146
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,480
she had rehearsed for the event.

147
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,520
If she rehearsed, she would know the name of the psychologist speaking about the data.

148
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,680
Once again, I politely asked for anyone I could contact to discuss a large scale and

149
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
amazing study.

150
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,120
I was told to watch the VOD.

151
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,920
Well that does seem a bit shady, doesn't it?

152
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,840
I mean, the other show's host, Tien Tran, has completely locked down her online profile,

153
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,280
and she was a virtual unknown before the Bully Hunters.

154
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,360
So fat chance of her finding out what her deal is.

155
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,680
But ZombieUnicorn has been all over the internet for years.

156
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,680
I'm sure she has a long history of standing up to bullying and harassment, right?

157
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:36,440
Oh wait, she has the exact opposite of that.

158
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,800
Now, I'm not somebody who sees any issue with in-game smack talk or use of the word

159
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
faggot or anything like that, but if you're going to claim to stand up for bullies arm

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,040
and arm with oppressed female gamers, maybe you shouldn't have a history of, time and

161
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,440
time again, being a bully yourself.

162
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,600
Like this.

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Or this.

164
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,900
Or this.

165
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Or this.

166
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,080
Or this.

167
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,320
Or this.

168
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Or this.

169
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Or this.

170
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Or this.

171
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,440
Alright, in the interest of being impartial, let's let ZombieUnicorn herself have her

172
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,720
say on the event.

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
It's only right she be allowed to speak.

174
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
Hold on, gotta cover up that free SteelSeries headset first.

175
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,200
Okay go ahead, you've got the floor.

176
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,400
It's based on real stuff that has happened and real examples of harassment.

177
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,720
So it's not completely- Yes, I'm sure it all really happened.

178
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,960
I mean, the show was presented as a live, currently occurring event.

179
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,000
I know you had a script and it was all fake, but in the script, it talked about how you

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,640
were presenting it as live.

181
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
The word live was in the script.

182
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,840
The statistics are real, they're just based on a smaller pool and they applied the percentages

183
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,120
to the overall population of female gamers.

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,040
So they're based on real statistics, but it's an extrapolation.

185
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,000
And if you check my Twitter, I have the link to the studies and the sources for all the-

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,760
Yes, absolutely top quality statistics there.

187
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,400
Nothing like a school project to give you the best of the best.

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,060
The thing about griefing is that, what that original tool thing would have been was they

189
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:11,340
join the game, play the game normally, and kill them once, and then say harassment's

190
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
not a game, and leave.

191
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,020
And nothing about that is inherently harassing or abusive or griefing, it's just playing

192
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
the game normally.

193
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,420
This sounds like something that any normal person would love to do, absolutely.

194
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,260
You know, I've got to work that 9 to 5, but I've got a few free hours out of my busy day,

195
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
what should I do?

196
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,140
Oh I know, I'll sign up to be a bully hunter and be on call, for free, to join other people's

197
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,380
games that I'm not invested in, kill somebody, promote a brand, and then bail out.

198
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:42,020
That's how I want to spend my evenings.

199
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,860
So hold on here for a minute, if the Bully Hunters tool was never intended to actually

200
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,060
stick around, on the one hand the upside is that I wouldn't actually be spending that

201
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,260
much of my free time.

202
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,620
But really, what was the point of all this?

203
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,340
You guys spent all this money, time, energy, production value on Bully Hunters, and for

204
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
what?

205
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
Was it intended to last?

206
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Was it for the show?

207
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,140
Because honestly, the two thirds of it that I cut out was them interviewing exceptionally

208
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,620
boring talking heads spouting pop psychology.

209
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,700
So why was this all made?

210
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,460
Oh yeah, SteelSeries.

211
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
That was it.

212
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,700
Selling gamer junk.

213
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,740
And according to our pal Zombie here, SteelSeries was front and center in organizing Bully Hunters.

214
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,820
One of the representatives from SteelSeries was involved as a consultant.

215
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,100
They were part of the meetings and the brainstorming, and that person is also the same person that

216
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,820
connected me with FCB and this campaign.

217
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,980
So the fact that they're saying that they had nothing to do with picking the talent,

218
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,260
that's not accurate.

219
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:44,020
And at the same time, they did have something to do with the discussion of how this event

220
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,180
campaign would go.

221
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,420
An archived listing on MediaPost also shows an advertising agency called FCB Chicago enlisting

222
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,200
SteelSeries, the National Coalition for Women, and the Diverse Gaming Coalition to be part

223
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
of Bully Hunters.

224
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
That's not what you'll hear from SteelSeries themselves.

225
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,400
Apparently it was all the Bully Hunters fault.

226
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,560
Same with VertiGear, they put up a similar statement distancing themselves from the whole

227
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
thing.

228
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,180
I mean, it's not like the source code of the Bully Hunters website directly references

229
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,720
SteelSeries' involvement as a corporate sponsor, right?

230
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
So what's the truth here?

231
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,520
Honestly it seems like everyone is just playing a game of hot potato, slowly realizing that

232
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,240
they're all a bunch of retards who tossed a lot of money into a flaming dumpster fire

233
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,120
and they're all racing to not be the last one holding the bag.

234
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,200
SteelSeries even believes its brand was so damaged by the Bully Hunters, they're considering

235
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
legal action.

236
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,080
I actually understand that point of view because, I mean, I know I'm never gonna support that

237
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,840
company again, after they decided to plaster their name all over a tool that downloads

238
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,720
a bunch of data not only from your Steam account, but also your Facebook if you're logged

239
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
in when you use it.

240
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,960
Or how the charity they planned to give the proceeds to was Time's Up Now, an activist

241
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,180
group that advocates for women in Hollywood.

242
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,400
Great job SteelSeries.

243
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,240
Take my money, take my private info, and give that shit right to Harvey Weinstein.

244
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Un-fucking-believable.

245
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,280
I have noticed something odd though.

246
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,840
All these older pictures and videos of Zombie Unicorn, they don't even seem to be the same

247
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
person.

248
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,120
I mean, this one girl here looks like she's about 90 pounds, while the host of Bully Hunters

249
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,240
looks like she might need to unbutton that blazer.

250
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's dig a little bit more and see if we can confirm these two to be the same person.

251
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh shit, she did a Playboy shoot back in the day.

252
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,960
A shoot that's only recently been deleted now that the spotlight's on her.

253
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,960
This feels kinda like a Zoe Quinn situation, doesn't it, where a young spunky gamer girl

254
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,780
does a bit of porn on the side before she hits that fucking wall of mid-thirties depression.

255
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,860
You know, Zombie, it's not inevitable that you get out of shape as you get older, despite

256
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,960
what your girlfriends tell you at the ice cream cat lady meetup.

257
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,380
Just watch what you eat and hit the gym, and you can look just like your 20-year-old self

258
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
again.

259
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,380
Oh, I forgot, the gym's full of those misogynist males who just don't understand a woman's

260
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,380
struggle.

261
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Well, how about this?

262
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,240
I've got some corporate sponsors here in the wings.

263
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,540
Let's set up, say, Gym Hunters.

264
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,100
We'll go into gyms and act as fake spotters who drop weights on the dude bros who ruin

265
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,740
your feminine lifting experience for simply doing what is normal while at the gym.

266
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,800
I know it sounds like a stupid idea for a reality show, in fact, it might even be career

267
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,840
ending for anybody who decides to take it up.

268
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,180
That's right up your alley, isn't it?

269
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,080
Who knows, with any luck, maybe you'll even be able to make enough money to fund all those

270
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,140
lawsuits you're going to be faced with for filing false DMCAs against the entire fucking

271
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
internet.

272
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,460
Listen, if you didn't want people to make videos about your retarded shit, you shouldn't

273
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,440
have been a part of the retarded shit.

274
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,060
So the Bully Hunters stream ended with them checking the Twitch chatroom for feedback,

275
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,740
and afterward abruptly cutting the show early, presumably because the entire thing was swastikas

276
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,460
and ascii dicks and criparian copypasta.

277
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,980
And even though it's been just a few days, the Bully Hunters are already dead.

278
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,800
The website for the app was still running for a little while during the firestorm, albeit

279
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,580
without the corporate sponsor logos at the bottom, but as of this recording it's just

280
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
gone.

281
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,080
It's too bad, you know, I was really looking forward to being a Bully Hunter myself, even

282
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,580
though I was rejected from the site.

283
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,220
I guess my Steam account didn't have enough playthroughs of Life is Strange on file or

284
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
something.

285
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,020
But in the end we all knew it was going to end like this.

286
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,620
These morons painted a huge target on themselves, no really it was in their fucking logo, and

287
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,060
it really seems like a few stupid venture capitalists thought they could milk gamers

288
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,820
for a quick easy buck by putting together the flimsiest of causes parroted by the most

289
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,100
bit-part actors and low-rent Twitch streamers they could find.

290
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,460
For anybody who came out of this looking bad, from products to personalities, you've only

291
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:26,620
got yourselves to blame.
