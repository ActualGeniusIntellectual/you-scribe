00:00.000 --> 00:16.280
Well, I had intended this to be a dumping with Scrump, but when I sat down to record

00:16.280 --> 00:19.560
it my internet went out, so I guess I'll just have to do it live.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.960
And by live I mean the opposite of live.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.000
Sorry, Scrump.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.360
But speaking of claiming to do something live, but actually not, let's talk about Bully

00:27.360 --> 00:28.360
Hunters.

00:28.360 --> 00:45.880
Oh boy, this sounds like a show I want to watch.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.800
This sounds like a channel I want to follow.

00:47.800 --> 01:12.880
Tell me more.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.700
While our casual gamers are playing, they may experience harassment.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.880
When that happens, we'll be alerted.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.020
They'll also call on a Bully Hunter.

01:21.020 --> 01:26.900
A Bully Hunter will jump into their game and take on harassment head on.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.380
They'll hunt down and take out the perpetrator.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.100
You heard that correctly.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.340
Bully Hunters will get these harassers where it hurts them the most, by beating bullies

01:35.340 --> 01:35.780
at their own game.

01:35.780 --> 01:50.260
This is a type of harassment that over 21 million female gamers have experienced.

01:50.260 --> 01:53.700
It was at this moment when we saw that it was not just trash talking.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.480
It was straight up harassment.

01:55.480 --> 01:59.460
So that's when the Rose Thorn, our casual gamer, decided to call on one of our Bully

01:59.460 --> 02:00.460
Hunters.

02:00.460 --> 02:04.380
What the Rose Thorn did in this case was use our new tool on her mobile device.

02:04.380 --> 02:07.020
It says our Bully Hunter has just entered the game.

02:07.020 --> 02:10.300
See, Bully Hunter 77 has joined the game.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.680
Now our victim, the Rose Thorn, and our Bully Hunter can communicate with one another.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.420
Now you see there, the tool connected these two.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.180
A victim with a Bully Hunter.

02:19.180 --> 02:24.460
Okay, so now Bully Hunter 77 knows the name of the harasser and she is ready to take action.

02:24.460 --> 02:29.100
Now we are going to switch over to Bully Hunter 77's screen to watch the hunt.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.040
And it looks like she's going to use her knife, folks, and there it is.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.460
Just pause right there.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.780
Let's back up and see that again.

02:35.780 --> 02:40.660
A brilliant knife move.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.660
Very difficult.

02:41.660 --> 02:42.660
And look right there.

02:42.660 --> 02:47.220
See, in the lower left hand corner, let's pause that and zoom into that.

02:47.220 --> 02:51.020
Our Bully Hunter left the calling card message to the harasser.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.460
Harassment is not a game.

02:52.460 --> 02:58.960
Bully Hunters dot org.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.060
So let me get this straight.

03:00.060 --> 03:04.380
You've gathered together a bunch of female gamers who are just casually playing CSGO,

03:04.380 --> 03:07.820
having a good time, and waiting for a dude on the other end to shit talk them.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.980
Once this happens, one of your Bully Hunter pro gamers will join the game, kill them in

03:11.980 --> 03:16.160
the game, and then leave a message in the chat saying, harassment is not bullying.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
Bully Hunters dot org.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.100
Okay, okay, before we get into just how pants on head retarded this idea is, let's take

03:22.100 --> 03:24.460
a look at the pure logistical problems involved.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.100
One, there's already block and report buttons in CSGO.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.860
If you don't want to hear an asshole in the game, you don't have to.

03:30.860 --> 03:35.420
Two, CSGO is a team based shooter, meaning you're only able to hear the voice chat

03:35.420 --> 03:37.100
of people on your own team.

03:37.100 --> 03:40.680
If an enemy is angry with you, you can't hear his voice taunts.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.840
If a teammate is yelling at you over voice chat, and you call a Bully Hunter in, this

03:44.840 --> 03:49.620
Hunter would have to join the opposing team in order to hunt your harassing teammate down,

03:49.620 --> 03:52.580
making it very likely they'd kill you in the crossfire.

03:52.580 --> 03:56.900
Three, this won't work if a CSGO match is already full, or if you're playing the game

03:56.900 --> 03:57.900
in competitive.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.340
Because new people won't be allowed to join the match in either of those scenarios.

04:01.340 --> 04:05.460
Four, getting other people to fight a bully for you not only would make the bully more

04:05.460 --> 04:08.500
likely to continue targeting you, it's also some weak ass shit.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.220
Why not get better at the game and kill them yourself, rather than calling your big brother

04:12.220 --> 04:13.220
over?

04:13.220 --> 04:16.100
If you actually use this tool, you deserve to be shit on at that point.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.740
Five, how well do you think your service is actually going to function when the internet

04:19.740 --> 04:24.280
clues into what you're doing and clogs the Bully Hunter request queue up with bullshit?

04:24.280 --> 04:28.460
Or alternatively, fills the Bully Hunter application queue up with fake applicants.

04:28.460 --> 04:33.160
Or even worse, when one of these fake applicants manages to slip in, become a Hunter, and trolls

04:33.160 --> 04:34.160
the entire service.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.560
But you know, there was something odd about the actual show itself, wasn't there?

04:37.560 --> 04:40.880
I don't know, it didn't seem quite right, like everything was staged instead of being

04:40.880 --> 04:41.880
a live production.

04:41.880 --> 04:53.040
They'd show the casual gamers playing, say something like cut to her feed, and it would

04:53.040 --> 04:54.880
be a completely different location on the map.

04:54.880 --> 05:00.000
And then when that one casual player, TheRoseThorns, called in BullyHunter77, it all moved a bit

05:00.000 --> 05:01.240
too smoothly, didn't it?

05:01.240 --> 05:05.400
I guess that's to be expected, since it turns out that they were the same fucking person.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.520
The history logs of TheRoseThorns' steen account shows that it's also recently gone by the

05:09.520 --> 05:13.700
name of BullyHunter77, as well as BullyHunters89 and 3.

05:13.700 --> 05:14.880
It was all a fake.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.560
But despite that, there were still some pretty serious claims made.

05:17.560 --> 05:45.520
Three

05:45.520 --> 05:47.360
million women harassed in gaming.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.360
It's no laughing matter.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.000
Let's look into these statistics a bit more to see if we can get into the real deal.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.520
PlatinumParagon, a researcher and PhD student, published a blog post breaking down the numbers

05:55.520 --> 05:57.740
presented during the BullyHunters broadcast.

05:57.740 --> 06:01.040
Around 3 million women have stopped playing games altogether because of harassment.

06:01.040 --> 06:06.220
The source for this is a 2012 survey of 874 participants, extrapolated to every single

06:06.220 --> 06:08.040
console owning women in America.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.720
This means that what was previously around 3 million women have stopped playing games

06:11.720 --> 06:16.400
altogether because of harassment is actually 84 women stopped playing one online game because

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
of harassment.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.800
While I deeply feel for these women, this is a false, dishonest, and huge stretch in

06:21.800 --> 06:26.740
the data in what has been uncovered to be a marketing campaign for SteelSeries headsets.

06:26.740 --> 06:29.920
False mental health statistics are being pushed to sell you gamer gear.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.760
To this I have three things to say.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.760
1.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.760
You are right.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.480
874 participants is a decent participant pool to extrapolate from.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
2.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.140
The extrapolation was made incorrectly for hyperbole.

06:40.140 --> 06:44.920
What was women quitting one game became women being pushed out of games entirely, with the

06:44.920 --> 06:49.320
use of have stopped playing games altogether from ZombieUnicorn, the host.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.320
3.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.900
The worst crime is that the extrapolation as a whole was done incorrectly.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.940
Extrapolation is a good thing because things like random sampling allow us to make inferences

06:56.940 --> 07:01.040
about patterns of illness and behavior without sampling the entire population, but when we

07:01.040 --> 07:05.780
extrapolate we make very very very clear that we are extrapolating, otherwise we are quite

07:05.780 --> 07:07.840
simply lying and reporting fake data.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.780
The extrapolation was applied only to American women who own a console.

07:10.780 --> 07:15.220
This is a methodological flaw as not only are female PC gamers left out, but it is arguably

07:15.220 --> 07:18.820
easier to harass somebody on a PC due to the increased likelihood of having a keyboard

07:18.820 --> 07:19.820
at your fingertips.

07:19.820 --> 07:23.260
And I would just like to personally add to this, the entire Bully Hunter premise revolves

07:23.260 --> 07:27.740
around PC gaming, from the Bully Hunter site, to Steam integration, to CSGO.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.780
I think we should take a look at this 2012 study for ourselves.

07:30.780 --> 07:34.020
Maybe a closer look at the raw data will shed some light in this situation.

07:34.020 --> 07:38.480
Well it turns out that it's actually a student project, written and researched by Emily Matthew.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.560
This wasn't a peer reviewed university funded piece of academic literature, this was a class

07:42.560 --> 07:45.600
project later published on pricecharting.com.

07:45.600 --> 07:50.240
Emily Matthew actually posted the results of her project over on reddit at r slash girl

07:50.240 --> 07:52.440
gamers, and replied to some criticism there as well.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.500
I've never done a survey like this before, so that's something that I'll have to consider

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
in the future.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.760
Well shit, this seems like a real professional piece of work, doesn't it?

07:59.760 --> 08:03.040
Certainly something the Bully Hunters should use as a cornerstone of their entire operation,

08:03.040 --> 08:04.040
right?

08:04.040 --> 08:07.160
Imagine handing in a bullshit high school essay or something, and then realizing five

08:07.160 --> 08:11.040
years later, some marketing company found it and turned into the basis for an online

08:11.040 --> 08:12.040
train wreck.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.240
Oh, and Emily?

08:13.240 --> 08:17.100
If you've been trying and failing for the past 12 years to get that Bachelors of English,

08:17.100 --> 08:20.240
like it says on your resume, maybe you should look at doing something else with your life.

08:20.240 --> 08:25.280
I mean, in that time span, I attended school, took a break from school, worked a real job

08:25.280 --> 08:30.260
for a little while, went back to school, completed a degree, and worked most of my way through

08:30.260 --> 08:31.400
a second one.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.400
Just saying.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.680
In any case, in trying to find the source for these statistics, PlatinumParagon actually

08:36.680 --> 08:39.520
ran into a wall, the show's host, ZombieUnicorn.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.160
I searched for such a study during my lunch break and could not find even a crumb of such

08:43.160 --> 08:44.160
a study.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.320
Desperate to find out more, I politely asked for a citation.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.020
She refused, telling me to watch the stream for the source.

08:49.020 --> 08:52.180
I genuinely did not have time to watch the stream for one source, so I recalled that

08:52.180 --> 08:53.480
she had rehearsed for the event.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.520
If she rehearsed, she would know the name of the psychologist speaking about the data.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.680
Once again, I politely asked for anyone I could contact to discuss a large scale and

08:59.680 --> 09:00.680
amazing study.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.120
I was told to watch the VOD.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.920
Well that does seem a bit shady, doesn't it?

09:04.160 --> 09:07.840
I mean, the other show's host, Tien Tran, has completely locked down her online profile,

09:07.840 --> 09:10.280
and she was a virtual unknown before the Bully Hunters.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.360
So fat chance of her finding out what her deal is.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.680
But ZombieUnicorn has been all over the internet for years.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.680
I'm sure she has a long history of standing up to bullying and harassment, right?

09:17.680 --> 09:36.440
Oh wait, she has the exact opposite of that.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.800
Now, I'm not somebody who sees any issue with in-game smack talk or use of the word

09:40.800 --> 09:44.240
faggot or anything like that, but if you're going to claim to stand up for bullies arm

09:44.240 --> 09:48.040
and arm with oppressed female gamers, maybe you shouldn't have a history of, time and

09:48.040 --> 09:50.440
time again, being a bully yourself.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.600
Like this.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
Or this.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.900
Or this.

09:53.900 --> 09:54.900
Or this.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.080
Or this.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.320
Or this.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.320
Or this.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.320
Or this.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.320
Or this.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.440
Alright, in the interest of being impartial, let's let ZombieUnicorn herself have her

10:04.440 --> 10:05.720
say on the event.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.440
It's only right she be allowed to speak.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.560
Hold on, gotta cover up that free SteelSeries headset first.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.200
Okay go ahead, you've got the floor.

10:12.200 --> 10:19.400
It's based on real stuff that has happened and real examples of harassment.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.720
So it's not completely- Yes, I'm sure it all really happened.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.960
I mean, the show was presented as a live, currently occurring event.

10:26.960 --> 10:31.000
I know you had a script and it was all fake, but in the script, it talked about how you

10:31.000 --> 10:32.640
were presenting it as live.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.880
The word live was in the script.

10:34.880 --> 10:40.840
The statistics are real, they're just based on a smaller pool and they applied the percentages

10:40.840 --> 10:44.120
to the overall population of female gamers.

10:44.120 --> 10:49.040
So they're based on real statistics, but it's an extrapolation.

10:49.040 --> 10:53.000
And if you check my Twitter, I have the link to the studies and the sources for all the-

10:53.000 --> 10:55.760
Yes, absolutely top quality statistics there.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.400
Nothing like a school project to give you the best of the best.

10:58.400 --> 11:04.060
The thing about griefing is that, what that original tool thing would have been was they

11:04.060 --> 11:11.340
join the game, play the game normally, and kill them once, and then say harassment's

11:11.340 --> 11:12.340
not a game, and leave.

11:12.340 --> 11:17.020
And nothing about that is inherently harassing or abusive or griefing, it's just playing

11:17.020 --> 11:18.020
the game normally.

11:18.020 --> 11:21.420
This sounds like something that any normal person would love to do, absolutely.

11:21.420 --> 11:25.260
You know, I've got to work that 9 to 5, but I've got a few free hours out of my busy day,

11:25.260 --> 11:26.260
what should I do?

11:26.260 --> 11:30.140
Oh I know, I'll sign up to be a bully hunter and be on call, for free, to join other people's

11:30.140 --> 11:34.380
games that I'm not invested in, kill somebody, promote a brand, and then bail out.

11:34.380 --> 11:42.020
That's how I want to spend my evenings.

11:42.020 --> 11:45.860
So hold on here for a minute, if the Bully Hunters tool was never intended to actually

11:45.860 --> 11:49.060
stick around, on the one hand the upside is that I wouldn't actually be spending that

11:49.060 --> 11:50.260
much of my free time.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.620
But really, what was the point of all this?

11:52.620 --> 11:57.340
You guys spent all this money, time, energy, production value on Bully Hunters, and for

11:57.340 --> 11:58.340
what?

11:58.540 --> 11:59.540
Was it intended to last?

11:59.540 --> 12:00.540
Was it for the show?

12:00.540 --> 12:04.140
Because honestly, the two thirds of it that I cut out was them interviewing exceptionally

12:04.140 --> 12:06.620
boring talking heads spouting pop psychology.

12:06.620 --> 12:07.700
So why was this all made?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.460
Oh yeah, SteelSeries.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.460
That was it.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.700
Selling gamer junk.

12:11.700 --> 12:16.740
And according to our pal Zombie here, SteelSeries was front and center in organizing Bully Hunters.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.820
One of the representatives from SteelSeries was involved as a consultant.

12:19.820 --> 12:27.100
They were part of the meetings and the brainstorming, and that person is also the same person that

12:27.100 --> 12:29.820
connected me with FCB and this campaign.

12:29.820 --> 12:34.980
So the fact that they're saying that they had nothing to do with picking the talent,

12:34.980 --> 12:37.260
that's not accurate.

12:37.260 --> 12:44.020
And at the same time, they did have something to do with the discussion of how this event

12:44.020 --> 12:45.180
campaign would go.

12:45.180 --> 12:50.420
An archived listing on MediaPost also shows an advertising agency called FCB Chicago enlisting

12:50.420 --> 12:54.200
SteelSeries, the National Coalition for Women, and the Diverse Gaming Coalition to be part

12:54.200 --> 12:55.200
of Bully Hunters.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.600
That's not what you'll hear from SteelSeries themselves.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.400
Apparently it was all the Bully Hunters fault.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.560
Same with VertiGear, they put up a similar statement distancing themselves from the whole

13:02.560 --> 13:03.560
thing.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.180
I mean, it's not like the source code of the Bully Hunters website directly references

13:06.180 --> 13:08.720
SteelSeries' involvement as a corporate sponsor, right?

13:08.720 --> 13:09.960
So what's the truth here?

13:09.960 --> 13:13.520
Honestly it seems like everyone is just playing a game of hot potato, slowly realizing that

13:13.520 --> 13:17.240
they're all a bunch of retards who tossed a lot of money into a flaming dumpster fire

13:17.240 --> 13:20.120
and they're all racing to not be the last one holding the bag.

13:20.120 --> 13:24.200
SteelSeries even believes its brand was so damaged by the Bully Hunters, they're considering

13:24.200 --> 13:25.200
legal action.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.080
I actually understand that point of view because, I mean, I know I'm never gonna support that

13:29.080 --> 13:32.840
company again, after they decided to plaster their name all over a tool that downloads

13:32.840 --> 13:36.720
a bunch of data not only from your Steam account, but also your Facebook if you're logged

13:36.720 --> 13:37.760
in when you use it.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.960
Or how the charity they planned to give the proceeds to was Time's Up Now, an activist

13:41.960 --> 13:44.180
group that advocates for women in Hollywood.

13:44.180 --> 13:45.400
Great job SteelSeries.

13:45.400 --> 13:49.240
Take my money, take my private info, and give that shit right to Harvey Weinstein.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.240
Un-fucking-believable.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.280
I have noticed something odd though.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.840
All these older pictures and videos of Zombie Unicorn, they don't even seem to be the same

13:55.840 --> 13:56.840
person.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.120
I mean, this one girl here looks like she's about 90 pounds, while the host of Bully Hunters

14:00.120 --> 14:02.240
looks like she might need to unbutton that blazer.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.240
Let's dig a little bit more and see if we can confirm these two to be the same person.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.560
Oh shit, she did a Playboy shoot back in the day.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.960
A shoot that's only recently been deleted now that the spotlight's on her.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.960
This feels kinda like a Zoe Quinn situation, doesn't it, where a young spunky gamer girl

14:14.960 --> 14:18.780
does a bit of porn on the side before she hits that fucking wall of mid-thirties depression.

14:18.780 --> 14:22.860
You know, Zombie, it's not inevitable that you get out of shape as you get older, despite

14:22.860 --> 14:25.960
what your girlfriends tell you at the ice cream cat lady meetup.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.380
Just watch what you eat and hit the gym, and you can look just like your 20-year-old self

14:29.380 --> 14:30.380
again.

14:30.380 --> 14:34.380
Oh, I forgot, the gym's full of those misogynist males who just don't understand a woman's

14:34.380 --> 14:35.380
struggle.

14:35.380 --> 14:36.380
Well, how about this?

14:36.380 --> 14:38.240
I've got some corporate sponsors here in the wings.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.540
Let's set up, say, Gym Hunters.

14:40.540 --> 14:45.100
We'll go into gyms and act as fake spotters who drop weights on the dude bros who ruin

14:45.100 --> 14:48.740
your feminine lifting experience for simply doing what is normal while at the gym.

14:48.740 --> 14:52.800
I know it sounds like a stupid idea for a reality show, in fact, it might even be career

14:52.800 --> 14:54.840
ending for anybody who decides to take it up.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.180
That's right up your alley, isn't it?

14:56.180 --> 15:00.080
Who knows, with any luck, maybe you'll even be able to make enough money to fund all those

15:00.080 --> 15:04.140
lawsuits you're going to be faced with for filing false DMCAs against the entire fucking

15:04.140 --> 15:05.140
internet.

15:05.140 --> 15:08.460
Listen, if you didn't want people to make videos about your retarded shit, you shouldn't

15:08.460 --> 15:10.440
have been a part of the retarded shit.

15:10.440 --> 15:14.060
So the Bully Hunters stream ended with them checking the Twitch chatroom for feedback,

15:14.060 --> 15:18.740
and afterward abruptly cutting the show early, presumably because the entire thing was swastikas

15:18.740 --> 15:21.460
and ascii dicks and criparian copypasta.

15:21.460 --> 15:24.980
And even though it's been just a few days, the Bully Hunters are already dead.

15:24.980 --> 15:28.800
The website for the app was still running for a little while during the firestorm, albeit

15:28.800 --> 15:32.580
without the corporate sponsor logos at the bottom, but as of this recording it's just

15:32.580 --> 15:33.580
gone.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.080
It's too bad, you know, I was really looking forward to being a Bully Hunter myself, even

15:36.080 --> 15:37.580
though I was rejected from the site.

15:37.580 --> 15:41.220
I guess my Steam account didn't have enough playthroughs of Life is Strange on file or

15:41.220 --> 15:42.220
something.

15:42.220 --> 15:44.020
But in the end we all knew it was going to end like this.

15:44.020 --> 15:48.620
These morons painted a huge target on themselves, no really it was in their fucking logo, and

15:48.620 --> 15:52.060
it really seems like a few stupid venture capitalists thought they could milk gamers

15:52.060 --> 15:55.820
for a quick easy buck by putting together the flimsiest of causes parroted by the most

15:55.820 --> 15:59.100
bit-part actors and low-rent Twitch streamers they could find.

15:59.100 --> 16:03.460
For anybody who came out of this looking bad, from products to personalities, you've only

16:03.460 --> 16:26.620
got yourselves to blame.
