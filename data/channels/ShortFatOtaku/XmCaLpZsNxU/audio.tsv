0	3300	What's up, guys? Dev here, doing some more TikTok Tuesdays.
3300	7700	I just got back from visiting my family for Christmas.
7700	10300	Yeah, I know Christmas is next week, but I did it early,
10300	11600	so I got some things going on.
11600	14900	And in fact, actually, I tried to record this on a laptop,
14900	17800	you know, back in my hometown, sitting in the old rec room,
17800	19500	trying to do it with people around me.
19500	20800	It just wasn't working.
20800	24400	So I'm back now. I got back to my place this morning,
24400	26700	and I'm doing this now to come out in the evening, hopefully.
26700	29700	So let's watch some TikToks.
29700	31900	OK, here we have a master criminal at work.
31900	35000	Oh, his voice over this one guy says, but you can have it.
35000	38600	It's a company car that makes his getaway.
38800	40800	He just walks away. One problem.
40800	43200	He can't drive a stick.
45200	47200	What are you going to do now, bro?
47200	49000	Hey, your buddy done left you.
49000	51300	You're on your own now.
51300	53200	Oh, my God.
53200	54900	Let's read that for a second.
54900	56900	Oh, man, someone's reacted to my TikToks.
57700	60000	You guys are sending them to be pre reacted to.
60000	64200	Damn. Anyway, that is pretty funny, though.
64200	66900	He's he's just stuck there with a car that he can't drive.
66900	68000	Good job.
68000	69500	I care about the planet, but guess what?
69500	71800	This fucking pisses me off because this is a paper straw.
71800	74200	Now, this paper straw is going to fall apart
74200	76300	and make your drink suck halfway through it.
76300	78200	Yeah, it's going to start getting disgusting, right?
78200	80100	Yeah, but the thing that makes me mad about it
80100	83600	is it came in a plastic cup with a plastic cover.
83600	85600	This radio must be 20 to one.
85600	88600	How about you give me a plastic straw and a paper fucking cup?
88600	91300	Then we can help the planet and get to join my fucking drink.
91300	92200	Yeah, why not? Why not?
92200	93800	Listen, that's completely true, right?
93800	95400	Ever since the paper straws have come in.
95400	97400	They've been they've been terrible.
97400	99900	Oh, man, fuck the paper straws, man.
99900	103400	You go to like a McDonald's or any of these fast food places.
103400	106300	They got paper or at least they had paper cups.
106300	107000	What the hell?
107000	109100	Why not just use those like paper, but wax covered,
109100	111400	you know, like use those for your drinks.
111400	112700	Isn't that better, man?
112700	113700	I think what's going on, though,
113700	115700	is that you see those pictures of turtles
115700	117900	that have plastic straws in their noses or whatever.
117900	120900	They want to avoid that because the shape of the plastic straw
120900	123600	is specifically harmful to wildlife.
123600	127000	But nonetheless, man, I hate I hate paper straws.
127300	129700	They're so god awful, man.
129700	132500	Whoa. Oh, my God.
133000	135800	I can't I can't do the music thing, but Jesus, what the fuck?
135800	137500	I got I got to play that again.
137500	139500	What are we looking at here, dude?
139500	142000	I thought it'd be a couple of pounds of metal in her face.
142100	145000	How is she getting through any sort of metal detector?
145000	145400	OK, hold on.
145400	146200	I'm playing it once more.
146200	148600	Look, imagine getting your dick sucked, fellas.
148900	150300	There's no fucking way.
150300	151600	There's no fucking way.
151600	153600	Who like, you know, I get it.
153600	155200	Like any little nose ring, the lip ring.
155200	158200	It can look kind of nice sometimes depending who the fuck thinks this is good.
158300	160200	This is way too fucking far, dude.
160200	162800	I promise to smack every chance I get.
163900	164500	That's all I got.
166300	169500	What is it all you have for your wedding?
170500	171500	What, really?
171500	172500	I didn't write nothing down.
172500	173400	That's what you're going out with?
173400	174300	That's what I'm going with.
174300	174800	Cool.
174800	175800	We've made it this long.
175800	177800	Oh, my God.
177800	183800	Listen, listen, ladies, would you marry a guy where that was the vows?
183800	186300	I promise to smack that like that's it.
186300	187700	Oh, my God.
187700	190400	Oh, I'm dying of cringe already.
190400	191500	Jesus.
191500	193200	You know, I look fucked up right now.
193200	194700	It's because I've been sobbing.
194700	196200	I was just talking with customer support.
196200	196800	Let's go on, dude.
196800	199000	I was called out to make stuff.
199000	200800	The lady, like, was super nice.
200800	202800	Yeah, so she called me Mr.
202800	205500	Carter, which is I mean, like, my voice is deep.
205500	206200	I get it.
206200	208000	It's like, yeah, actually, it's Miss Carter.
208000	210900	And she's like, oh, sorry.
210900	214000	Oh, she just proceeded to call me Carter.
214000	219400	But she kept saying, sir, it is accidental and incorrect herself.
219400	221100	But at some point during the call,
221100	227200	I just started sobbing because like, you know, that the dysphoria has been a lot lately.
227200	230900	I feel so bad because she she heard me sobbing.
230900	233400	And she's like, I'm so sorry.
233400	234800	I know how it feels, sir.
234800	238500	I mean, ma'am, God, oh, that's brutal.
238500	240400	When I when this when that clip first started,
240400	242900	I thought they were going to be like, fuck this woman.
242900	244300	She's transphobic.
244300	245500	She doesn't get it.
245500	246900	She's being a bigot.
246900	248700	No, you know, surprisingly didn't do that.
248700	249300	All right.
249300	254500	This is someone who just seems to be suffering because they don't pass.
254500	259300	And the person on the line was empathetic, but you know, that's just how it was.
259300	263100	And I mean, that's a that's a bad deal,
263100	267200	regardless of how you feel about the the political side of trans stuff.
267200	271900	It's not hard to point out when someone's just manufacturing outrage
271900	273900	and when someone's actually suffering.
273900	276500	I just taught my daughters the first lesson about white men.
276500	278300	There's going to be some racist shit, isn't it?
278300	280300	A little white boy, but here we go.
280300	282800	My daughters are happily playing on this park equipment
282800	285200	and here comes this little alabaster crotch fruit.
285200	288800	He can walk over races as fuck, shimmy his way in
288800	291600	and then look at my five year old and say, push me.
291600	294800	I asked running across the park,
294800	296400	but somebody's about to take my time.
296400	298800	What five year old dead?
298800	300700	I said, you start pushing a little boy right now.
300700	302000	And it was one of them instances
302000	304200	where I raised my voice because I'm hoping the mama hear me.
304200	307100	Yeah, I said that little alabaster crotch is rude.
307100	309500	You do not let anybody treat you that way.
309500	311400	Definitely not that little boy.
311400	312900	So then as he was on the park equipment,
312900	317400	I just sat there and I just looked at him.
317400	320200	So this is a message to the alabaster women
320200	323600	who are raising alabaster crotch fruit boys.
323600	327200	If you don't get your son,
327200	330800	do you best believe I'm going to teach my daughter how to get him?
330800	333000	This person has way too much fucking time on their hands.
333000	334000	Holy shit.
334000	337400	See, now this was a case of someone trying to manufacture outrage.
337400	340900	I do not believe this person when they described this event as it went down
340900	343300	and honestly, I think they're bringing their kids to the park
343300	345400	that something can happen and they can go viral on TikTok.
345400	349600	All right, this person is just out here trying to cause trouble.
349600	352900	Whoa, what the fuck?
352900	357300	How many Brazilian butt lifts is that lady?
357300	359500	Listen, I know that big asses are in right now,
359500	361700	but that's that was fucking grotesque.
361700	364600	What the fuck?
364600	367100	OK, dude.
367100	373300	Oh my God, speaking of grotesque.
373300	376100	Is this going to be in the rap video?
376100	382100	Because I feel like those the tires on that car are going to pop soon.
385800	389400	Listen, listen, as a fellow fatty, don't do this shit.
389400	392200	You're not good looking. Don't do this shit, OK?
392200	396400	Oh my God, I can't believe this is the first thing I'm doing
396400	399800	when I come home guys is is watching TikTok for you.
399800	403500	I mean, I was sleeping in like the stiffest bed.
403500	406400	I got no sleep. My back is fucked.
406400	409500	God, I hate I hate going back to my hometown.
409500	411400	Fuck. What else do we got?
411400	413900	Not doing nine to five. I can't do it under five.
413900	417800	OK, I know this is going to sound like some artsy creative who, you know,
417800	420500	just doesn't want to put in the hard work and hours,
420500	423300	but I physically do not think I can do it.
423300	428000	I start to cry if I have more than like three non-creative tasks to do in a day
428000	433100	and imagining doing eight hours a day of something that I don't really love
433100	436700	for the rest of my life. Yeah, so there's no other option.
436700	442100	Yeah, get good. Yeah, get good. Take off. Take off or suffer.
442100	445700	Absolutely. People like us can't live normal lives.
445700	447600	If we try, it kills us.
447600	451200	And honestly, I am throwing myself into that category.
451200	453500	Yeah, because I think I will simply die.
453500	457300	So if you want to die and help be, you know,
457300	463200	one step in the process of me not literally dying, please stream it.
463200	466700	I love you guys. I don't know who this person is or her music.
466700	468800	But here's the thing. When I saw this go viral online,
468800	471400	I'm pretty sure everyone took it as like this,
471400	477600	you know, sheltered cushioned hipster art hoe girl who just can't make it in a real job.
477600	480300	And you know, fair enough, right? There's a whole bunch of those out there.
480300	482500	But everything that she said in there was completely true.
482500	486200	There are some people out there who just can't do the nine to five work for someone else.
486200	489100	All right. I'm one of them. I've done nine to five jobs.
489100	491200	I've done like white collar jobs, blue collar jobs.
491200	493700	It's like it's killed me to do some of these things.
493700	495400	It has deadened me inside.
495400	498100	So what she's saying is actually completely completely true.
498100	503800	But what the solution then is the solution is to work hard at the thing that you actually want and make it take off.
503800	507700	All right, you have to be the absolute best that you can be whatever your craft is
507700	511600	and you cannot give up and you can't be like, oh, I should just have a career handed to me.
511600	517700	No, you shouldn't actually. If you are going to have the luxury of being someone who can live off of their art,
517700	521300	and it is a luxury, you must work at it way more than a nine to five.
521300	525000	You aren't owed a creative career. You have to, you have to grab that.
525000	529500	You have to wrestle that. You have to, you know, extract that from the universe and make it your own.
529500	533900	Yeah, like I get the presentation is like hipster art hoe who can't work,
533900	539300	but there's truth in this for sure. What?
539300	547400	What? Oh, my God.
547400	549300	The older part sounds kind of inappropriate.
549300	553700	So I'm going to stop the song there and keep it kid friendly for all my young followers out there.
553700	557700	This is kid friendly. Beautiful and stay kind.
557700	560300	Okay. Was that real or was that a troll?
560300	564800	Is this an actual person who thinks that they are a trans girl and they're little and cute?
564800	570800	Or is this someone who is like specifically making a video like this to troll?
570800	574800	And I don't know, dude. I don't know.
574800	578600	The world is a weird fucking place nowadays, dude. I don't know.
578600	586300	Imagine going on a date. Oh, my God.
586300	590500	Got to get that perfect Instagram video for your food.
590500	595700	Oh, you know, I know that like I'm an influencer.
595700	600400	I know I know that's what I am, but I could never be someone like this.
600400	605800	Oh, my God, influencers, people who actually behave like influencers.
605800	610800	They are just some of the worst, most self-absorbed fucking people in the world.
610800	613600	I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it, dude.
613600	615900	I know like I'm out here making videos. You guys watch them.
615900	621200	I'm technically an influencer, but like I'm if I count as one, I am ashamed to be one.
621200	625100	Okay. And that brings us to the end of TikTok Tuesday for today.
625100	628600	I hope you enjoyed. I know I missed a few working on the skullgirls video,
628600	631200	but hey, we're back. We're back in form.
631200	634900	Oh, and I announced this on the weekly set, but I'll announce it real quick here.
634900	639100	I'm going away for Christmas yet again. Sorry, but that's just that's the season,
639100	642200	you know, so I just came back from a Christmas travel.
642200	644900	I'm going to go away again for another family Christmas travel
644900	647500	and I'll pretty much be gone the final week of December.
647500	649300	I'll try to I'll try to make some videos ahead of time
649300	654400	so that they can at least come out like while I'm gone, but I will I will not be present.
654400	658100	So I hope you all have a Merry Christmas or whatever other holiday you celebrate
658100	662100	and I will see you next time. Have a good one.
662100	664700	I love you.
