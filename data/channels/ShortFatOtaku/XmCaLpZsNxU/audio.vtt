00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
What's up, guys? Dev here, doing some more TikTok Tuesdays.

00:03.300 --> 00:07.700
I just got back from visiting my family for Christmas.

00:07.700 --> 00:10.300
Yeah, I know Christmas is next week, but I did it early,

00:10.300 --> 00:11.600
so I got some things going on.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.900
And in fact, actually, I tried to record this on a laptop,

00:14.900 --> 00:17.800
you know, back in my hometown, sitting in the old rec room,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.500
trying to do it with people around me.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.800
It just wasn't working.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.400
So I'm back now. I got back to my place this morning,

00:24.400 --> 00:26.700
and I'm doing this now to come out in the evening, hopefully.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.700
So let's watch some TikToks.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.900
OK, here we have a master criminal at work.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.000
Oh, his voice over this one guy says, but you can have it.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.600
It's a company car that makes his getaway.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
He just walks away. One problem.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.200
He can't drive a stick.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.200
What are you going to do now, bro?

00:47.200 --> 00:49.000
Hey, your buddy done left you.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.300
You're on your own now.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.200
Oh, my God.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.900
Let's read that for a second.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.900
Oh, man, someone's reacted to my TikToks.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.000
You guys are sending them to be pre reacted to.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.200
Damn. Anyway, that is pretty funny, though.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.900
He's he's just stuck there with a car that he can't drive.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.000
Good job.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.500
I care about the planet, but guess what?

01:09.500 --> 01:11.800
This fucking pisses me off because this is a paper straw.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.200
Now, this paper straw is going to fall apart

01:14.200 --> 01:16.300
and make your drink suck halfway through it.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.200
Yeah, it's going to start getting disgusting, right?

01:18.200 --> 01:20.100
Yeah, but the thing that makes me mad about it

01:20.100 --> 01:23.600
is it came in a plastic cup with a plastic cover.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.600
This radio must be 20 to one.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.600
How about you give me a plastic straw and a paper fucking cup?

01:28.600 --> 01:31.300
Then we can help the planet and get to join my fucking drink.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.200
Yeah, why not? Why not?

01:32.200 --> 01:33.800
Listen, that's completely true, right?

01:33.800 --> 01:35.400
Ever since the paper straws have come in.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.400
They've been they've been terrible.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.900
Oh, man, fuck the paper straws, man.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.400
You go to like a McDonald's or any of these fast food places.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.300
They got paper or at least they had paper cups.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.000
What the hell?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.100
Why not just use those like paper, but wax covered,

01:49.100 --> 01:51.400
you know, like use those for your drinks.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.700
Isn't that better, man?

01:52.700 --> 01:53.700
I think what's going on, though,

01:53.700 --> 01:55.700
is that you see those pictures of turtles

01:55.700 --> 01:57.900
that have plastic straws in their noses or whatever.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.900
They want to avoid that because the shape of the plastic straw

02:00.900 --> 02:03.600
is specifically harmful to wildlife.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.000
But nonetheless, man, I hate I hate paper straws.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.700
They're so god awful, man.

02:09.700 --> 02:12.500
Whoa. Oh, my God.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.800
I can't I can't do the music thing, but Jesus, what the fuck?

02:15.800 --> 02:17.500
I got I got to play that again.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
What are we looking at here, dude?

02:19.500 --> 02:22.000
I thought it'd be a couple of pounds of metal in her face.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.000
How is she getting through any sort of metal detector?

02:25.000 --> 02:25.400
OK, hold on.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.200
I'm playing it once more.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.600
Look, imagine getting your dick sucked, fellas.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.300
There's no fucking way.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.600
There's no fucking way.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.600
Who like, you know, I get it.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.200
Like any little nose ring, the lip ring.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.200
It can look kind of nice sometimes depending who the fuck thinks this is good.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.200
This is way too fucking far, dude.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.800
I promise to smack every chance I get.

02:43.900 --> 02:44.500
That's all I got.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.500
What is it all you have for your wedding?

02:50.500 --> 02:51.500
What, really?

02:51.500 --> 02:52.500
I didn't write nothing down.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.400
That's what you're going out with?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.300
That's what I'm going with.

02:54.300 --> 02:54.800
Cool.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
We've made it this long.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.800
Oh, my God.

02:57.800 --> 03:03.800
Listen, listen, ladies, would you marry a guy where that was the vows?

03:03.800 --> 03:06.300
I promise to smack that like that's it.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.700
Oh, my God.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.400
Oh, I'm dying of cringe already.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.500
Jesus.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.200
You know, I look fucked up right now.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.700
It's because I've been sobbing.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.200
I was just talking with customer support.

03:16.200 --> 03:16.800
Let's go on, dude.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.000
I was called out to make stuff.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.800
The lady, like, was super nice.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.800
Yeah, so she called me Mr.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.500
Carter, which is I mean, like, my voice is deep.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.200
I get it.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.000
It's like, yeah, actually, it's Miss Carter.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.900
And she's like, oh, sorry.

03:30.900 --> 03:34.000
Oh, she just proceeded to call me Carter.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.400
But she kept saying, sir, it is accidental and incorrect herself.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.100
But at some point during the call,

03:41.100 --> 03:47.200
I just started sobbing because like, you know, that the dysphoria has been a lot lately.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.900
I feel so bad because she she heard me sobbing.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.400
And she's like, I'm so sorry.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.800
I know how it feels, sir.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.500
I mean, ma'am, God, oh, that's brutal.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.400
When I when this when that clip first started,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.900
I thought they were going to be like, fuck this woman.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.300
She's transphobic.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.500
She doesn't get it.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.900
She's being a bigot.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.700
No, you know, surprisingly didn't do that.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.300
All right.

04:09.300 --> 04:14.500
This is someone who just seems to be suffering because they don't pass.

04:14.500 --> 04:19.300
And the person on the line was empathetic, but you know, that's just how it was.

04:19.300 --> 04:23.100
And I mean, that's a that's a bad deal,

04:23.100 --> 04:27.200
regardless of how you feel about the the political side of trans stuff.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.900
It's not hard to point out when someone's just manufacturing outrage

04:31.900 --> 04:33.900
and when someone's actually suffering.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.500
I just taught my daughters the first lesson about white men.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.300
There's going to be some racist shit, isn't it?

04:38.300 --> 04:40.300
A little white boy, but here we go.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.800
My daughters are happily playing on this park equipment

04:42.800 --> 04:45.200
and here comes this little alabaster crotch fruit.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.800
He can walk over races as fuck, shimmy his way in

04:48.800 --> 04:51.600
and then look at my five year old and say, push me.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.800
I asked running across the park,

04:54.800 --> 04:56.400
but somebody's about to take my time.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.800
What five year old dead?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.700
I said, you start pushing a little boy right now.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.000
And it was one of them instances

05:02.000 --> 05:04.200
where I raised my voice because I'm hoping the mama hear me.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.100
Yeah, I said that little alabaster crotch is rude.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.500
You do not let anybody treat you that way.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.400
Definitely not that little boy.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.900
So then as he was on the park equipment,

05:12.900 --> 05:17.400
I just sat there and I just looked at him.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.200
So this is a message to the alabaster women

05:20.200 --> 05:23.600
who are raising alabaster crotch fruit boys.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.200
If you don't get your son,

05:27.200 --> 05:30.800
do you best believe I'm going to teach my daughter how to get him?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.000
This person has way too much fucking time on their hands.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Holy shit.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.400
See, now this was a case of someone trying to manufacture outrage.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.900
I do not believe this person when they described this event as it went down

05:40.900 --> 05:43.300
and honestly, I think they're bringing their kids to the park

05:43.300 --> 05:45.400
that something can happen and they can go viral on TikTok.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.600
All right, this person is just out here trying to cause trouble.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.900
Whoa, what the fuck?

05:52.900 --> 05:57.300
How many Brazilian butt lifts is that lady?

05:57.300 --> 05:59.500
Listen, I know that big asses are in right now,

05:59.500 --> 06:01.700
but that's that was fucking grotesque.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.600
What the fuck?

06:04.600 --> 06:07.100
OK, dude.

06:07.100 --> 06:13.300
Oh my God, speaking of grotesque.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.100
Is this going to be in the rap video?

06:16.100 --> 06:22.100
Because I feel like those the tires on that car are going to pop soon.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.400
Listen, listen, as a fellow fatty, don't do this shit.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.200
You're not good looking. Don't do this shit, OK?

06:32.200 --> 06:36.400
Oh my God, I can't believe this is the first thing I'm doing

06:36.400 --> 06:39.800
when I come home guys is is watching TikTok for you.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.500
I mean, I was sleeping in like the stiffest bed.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.400
I got no sleep. My back is fucked.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.500
God, I hate I hate going back to my hometown.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.400
Fuck. What else do we got?

06:51.400 --> 06:53.900
Not doing nine to five. I can't do it under five.

06:53.900 --> 06:57.800
OK, I know this is going to sound like some artsy creative who, you know,

06:57.800 --> 07:00.500
just doesn't want to put in the hard work and hours,

07:00.500 --> 07:03.300
but I physically do not think I can do it.

07:03.300 --> 07:08.000
I start to cry if I have more than like three non-creative tasks to do in a day

07:08.000 --> 07:13.100
and imagining doing eight hours a day of something that I don't really love

07:13.100 --> 07:16.700
for the rest of my life. Yeah, so there's no other option.

07:16.700 --> 07:22.100
Yeah, get good. Yeah, get good. Take off. Take off or suffer.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.700
Absolutely. People like us can't live normal lives.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.600
If we try, it kills us.

07:27.600 --> 07:31.200
And honestly, I am throwing myself into that category.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.500
Yeah, because I think I will simply die.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.300
So if you want to die and help be, you know,

07:37.300 --> 07:43.200
one step in the process of me not literally dying, please stream it.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.700
I love you guys. I don't know who this person is or her music.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.800
But here's the thing. When I saw this go viral online,

07:48.800 --> 07:51.400
I'm pretty sure everyone took it as like this,

07:51.400 --> 07:57.600
you know, sheltered cushioned hipster art hoe girl who just can't make it in a real job.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.300
And you know, fair enough, right? There's a whole bunch of those out there.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.500
But everything that she said in there was completely true.

08:02.500 --> 08:06.200
There are some people out there who just can't do the nine to five work for someone else.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.100
All right. I'm one of them. I've done nine to five jobs.

08:09.100 --> 08:11.200
I've done like white collar jobs, blue collar jobs.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.700
It's like it's killed me to do some of these things.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.400
It has deadened me inside.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.100
So what she's saying is actually completely completely true.

08:18.100 --> 08:23.800
But what the solution then is the solution is to work hard at the thing that you actually want and make it take off.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.700
All right, you have to be the absolute best that you can be whatever your craft is

08:27.700 --> 08:31.600
and you cannot give up and you can't be like, oh, I should just have a career handed to me.

08:31.600 --> 08:37.700
No, you shouldn't actually. If you are going to have the luxury of being someone who can live off of their art,

08:37.700 --> 08:41.300
and it is a luxury, you must work at it way more than a nine to five.

08:41.300 --> 08:45.000
You aren't owed a creative career. You have to, you have to grab that.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.500
You have to wrestle that. You have to, you know, extract that from the universe and make it your own.

08:49.500 --> 08:53.900
Yeah, like I get the presentation is like hipster art hoe who can't work,

08:53.900 --> 08:59.300
but there's truth in this for sure. What?

08:59.300 --> 09:07.400
What? Oh, my God.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.300
The older part sounds kind of inappropriate.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.700
So I'm going to stop the song there and keep it kid friendly for all my young followers out there.

09:13.700 --> 09:17.700
This is kid friendly. Beautiful and stay kind.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.300
Okay. Was that real or was that a troll?

09:20.300 --> 09:24.800
Is this an actual person who thinks that they are a trans girl and they're little and cute?

09:24.800 --> 09:30.800
Or is this someone who is like specifically making a video like this to troll?

09:30.800 --> 09:34.800
And I don't know, dude. I don't know.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.600
The world is a weird fucking place nowadays, dude. I don't know.

09:38.600 --> 09:46.300
Imagine going on a date. Oh, my God.

09:46.300 --> 09:50.500
Got to get that perfect Instagram video for your food.

09:50.500 --> 09:55.700
Oh, you know, I know that like I'm an influencer.

09:55.700 --> 10:00.400
I know I know that's what I am, but I could never be someone like this.

10:00.400 --> 10:05.800
Oh, my God, influencers, people who actually behave like influencers.

10:05.800 --> 10:10.800
They are just some of the worst, most self-absorbed fucking people in the world.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.600
I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it, dude.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.900
I know like I'm out here making videos. You guys watch them.

10:15.900 --> 10:21.200
I'm technically an influencer, but like I'm if I count as one, I am ashamed to be one.

10:21.200 --> 10:25.100
Okay. And that brings us to the end of TikTok Tuesday for today.

10:25.100 --> 10:28.600
I hope you enjoyed. I know I missed a few working on the skullgirls video,

10:28.600 --> 10:31.200
but hey, we're back. We're back in form.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.900
Oh, and I announced this on the weekly set, but I'll announce it real quick here.

10:34.900 --> 10:39.100
I'm going away for Christmas yet again. Sorry, but that's just that's the season,

10:39.100 --> 10:42.200
you know, so I just came back from a Christmas travel.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.900
I'm going to go away again for another family Christmas travel

10:44.900 --> 10:47.500
and I'll pretty much be gone the final week of December.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.300
I'll try to I'll try to make some videos ahead of time

10:49.300 --> 10:54.400
so that they can at least come out like while I'm gone, but I will I will not be present.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.100
So I hope you all have a Merry Christmas or whatever other holiday you celebrate

10:58.100 --> 11:02.100
and I will see you next time. Have a good one.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.700
I love you.
