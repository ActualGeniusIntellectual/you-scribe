1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
What's up, guys? Dev here, doing some more TikTok Tuesdays.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,700
I just got back from visiting my family for Christmas.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,300
Yeah, I know Christmas is next week, but I did it early,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,600
so I got some things going on.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,900
And in fact, actually, I tried to record this on a laptop,

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,800
you know, back in my hometown, sitting in the old rec room,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,500
trying to do it with people around me.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,800
It just wasn't working.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,400
So I'm back now. I got back to my place this morning,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,700
and I'm doing this now to come out in the evening, hopefully.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,700
So let's watch some TikToks.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,900
OK, here we have a master criminal at work.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, his voice over this one guy says, but you can have it.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
It's a company car that makes his getaway.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
He just walks away. One problem.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
He can't drive a stick.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
What are you going to do now, bro?

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey, your buddy done left you.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,300
You're on your own now.

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,200
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,900
Let's read that for a second.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,900
Oh, man, someone's reacted to my TikToks.

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,000
You guys are sending them to be pre reacted to.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Damn. Anyway, that is pretty funny, though.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,900
He's he's just stuck there with a car that he can't drive.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,000
Good job.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
I care about the planet, but guess what?

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,800
This fucking pisses me off because this is a paper straw.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Now, this paper straw is going to fall apart

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,300
and make your drink suck halfway through it.

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,200
Yeah, it's going to start getting disgusting, right?

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,100
Yeah, but the thing that makes me mad about it

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,600
is it came in a plastic cup with a plastic cover.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
This radio must be 20 to one.

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
How about you give me a plastic straw and a paper fucking cup?

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,300
Then we can help the planet and get to join my fucking drink.

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,200
Yeah, why not? Why not?

38
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
Listen, that's completely true, right?

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
Ever since the paper straws have come in.

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
They've been they've been terrible.

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,900
Oh, man, fuck the paper straws, man.

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,400
You go to like a McDonald's or any of these fast food places.

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,300
They got paper or at least they had paper cups.

44
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,000
What the hell?

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,100
Why not just use those like paper, but wax covered,

46
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,400
you know, like use those for your drinks.

47
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,700
Isn't that better, man?

48
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,700
I think what's going on, though,

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
is that you see those pictures of turtles

50
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,900
that have plastic straws in their noses or whatever.

51
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
They want to avoid that because the shape of the plastic straw

52
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,600
is specifically harmful to wildlife.

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,000
But nonetheless, man, I hate I hate paper straws.

54
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,700
They're so god awful, man.

55
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,500
Whoa. Oh, my God.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,800
I can't I can't do the music thing, but Jesus, what the fuck?

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,500
I got I got to play that again.

58
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
What are we looking at here, dude?

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,000
I thought it'd be a couple of pounds of metal in her face.

60
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,000
How is she getting through any sort of metal detector?

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,400
OK, hold on.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm playing it once more.

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
Look, imagine getting your dick sucked, fellas.

64
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
There's no fucking way.

65
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,600
There's no fucking way.

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Who like, you know, I get it.

67
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
Like any little nose ring, the lip ring.

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,200
It can look kind of nice sometimes depending who the fuck thinks this is good.

69
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,200
This is way too fucking far, dude.

70
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,800
I promise to smack every chance I get.

71
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,500
That's all I got.

72
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,500
What is it all you have for your wedding?

73
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
What, really?

74
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I didn't write nothing down.

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,400
That's what you're going out with?

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,300
That's what I'm going with.

77
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,800
Cool.

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
We've made it this long.

79
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Oh, my God.

80
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Listen, listen, ladies, would you marry a guy where that was the vows?

81
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,300
I promise to smack that like that's it.

82
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,700
Oh, my God.

83
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,400
Oh, I'm dying of cringe already.

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,500
Jesus.

85
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,200
You know, I look fucked up right now.

86
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,700
It's because I've been sobbing.

87
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,200
I was just talking with customer support.

88
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's go on, dude.

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I was called out to make stuff.

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
The lady, like, was super nice.

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah, so she called me Mr.

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,500
Carter, which is I mean, like, my voice is deep.

93
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,200
I get it.

94
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
It's like, yeah, actually, it's Miss Carter.

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,900
And she's like, oh, sorry.

96
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, she just proceeded to call me Carter.

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,400
But she kept saying, sir, it is accidental and incorrect herself.

98
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,100
But at some point during the call,

99
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,200
I just started sobbing because like, you know, that the dysphoria has been a lot lately.

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,900
I feel so bad because she she heard me sobbing.

101
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,400
And she's like, I'm so sorry.

102
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
I know how it feels, sir.

103
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,500
I mean, ma'am, God, oh, that's brutal.

104
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,400
When I when this when that clip first started,

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,900
I thought they were going to be like, fuck this woman.

106
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,300
She's transphobic.

107
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,500
She doesn't get it.

108
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,900
She's being a bigot.

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,700
No, you know, surprisingly didn't do that.

110
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,300
All right.

111
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,500
This is someone who just seems to be suffering because they don't pass.

112
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,300
And the person on the line was empathetic, but you know, that's just how it was.

113
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,100
And I mean, that's a that's a bad deal,

114
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,200
regardless of how you feel about the the political side of trans stuff.

115
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,900
It's not hard to point out when someone's just manufacturing outrage

116
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
and when someone's actually suffering.

117
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,500
I just taught my daughters the first lesson about white men.

118
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,300
There's going to be some racist shit, isn't it?

119
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
A little white boy, but here we go.

120
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,800
My daughters are happily playing on this park equipment

121
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,200
and here comes this little alabaster crotch fruit.

122
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
He can walk over races as fuck, shimmy his way in

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,600
and then look at my five year old and say, push me.

124
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
I asked running across the park,

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
but somebody's about to take my time.

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
What five year old dead?

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
I said, you start pushing a little boy right now.

128
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,000
And it was one of them instances

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
where I raised my voice because I'm hoping the mama hear me.

130
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,100
Yeah, I said that little alabaster crotch is rude.

131
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,500
You do not let anybody treat you that way.

132
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,400
Definitely not that little boy.

133
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,900
So then as he was on the park equipment,

134
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,400
I just sat there and I just looked at him.

135
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,200
So this is a message to the alabaster women

136
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,600
who are raising alabaster crotch fruit boys.

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,200
If you don't get your son,

138
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,800
do you best believe I'm going to teach my daughter how to get him?

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
This person has way too much fucking time on their hands.

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Holy shit.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,400
See, now this was a case of someone trying to manufacture outrage.

142
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,900
I do not believe this person when they described this event as it went down

143
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,300
and honestly, I think they're bringing their kids to the park

144
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,400
that something can happen and they can go viral on TikTok.

145
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,600
All right, this person is just out here trying to cause trouble.

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,900
Whoa, what the fuck?

147
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,300
How many Brazilian butt lifts is that lady?

148
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,500
Listen, I know that big asses are in right now,

149
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,700
but that's that was fucking grotesque.

150
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,600
What the fuck?

151
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,100
OK, dude.

152
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,300
Oh my God, speaking of grotesque.

153
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,100
Is this going to be in the rap video?

154
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Because I feel like those the tires on that car are going to pop soon.

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Listen, listen, as a fellow fatty, don't do this shit.

156
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
You're not good looking. Don't do this shit, OK?

157
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Oh my God, I can't believe this is the first thing I'm doing

158
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,800
when I come home guys is is watching TikTok for you.

159
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,500
I mean, I was sleeping in like the stiffest bed.

160
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,400
I got no sleep. My back is fucked.

161
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,500
God, I hate I hate going back to my hometown.

162
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,400
Fuck. What else do we got?

163
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,900
Not doing nine to five. I can't do it under five.

164
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,800
OK, I know this is going to sound like some artsy creative who, you know,

165
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,500
just doesn't want to put in the hard work and hours,

166
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,300
but I physically do not think I can do it.

167
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,000
I start to cry if I have more than like three non-creative tasks to do in a day

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,100
and imagining doing eight hours a day of something that I don't really love

169
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,700
for the rest of my life. Yeah, so there's no other option.

170
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Yeah, get good. Yeah, get good. Take off. Take off or suffer.

171
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,700
Absolutely. People like us can't live normal lives.

172
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,600
If we try, it kills us.

173
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,200
And honestly, I am throwing myself into that category.

174
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,500
Yeah, because I think I will simply die.

175
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,300
So if you want to die and help be, you know,

176
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,200
one step in the process of me not literally dying, please stream it.

177
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,700
I love you guys. I don't know who this person is or her music.

178
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,800
But here's the thing. When I saw this go viral online,

179
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm pretty sure everyone took it as like this,

180
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,600
you know, sheltered cushioned hipster art hoe girl who just can't make it in a real job.

181
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,300
And you know, fair enough, right? There's a whole bunch of those out there.

182
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,500
But everything that she said in there was completely true.

183
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,200
There are some people out there who just can't do the nine to five work for someone else.

184
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,100
All right. I'm one of them. I've done nine to five jobs.

185
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,200
I've done like white collar jobs, blue collar jobs.

186
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,700
It's like it's killed me to do some of these things.

187
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,400
It has deadened me inside.

188
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,100
So what she's saying is actually completely completely true.

189
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,800
But what the solution then is the solution is to work hard at the thing that you actually want and make it take off.

190
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,700
All right, you have to be the absolute best that you can be whatever your craft is

191
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,600
and you cannot give up and you can't be like, oh, I should just have a career handed to me.

192
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,700
No, you shouldn't actually. If you are going to have the luxury of being someone who can live off of their art,

193
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,300
and it is a luxury, you must work at it way more than a nine to five.

194
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,000
You aren't owed a creative career. You have to, you have to grab that.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,500
You have to wrestle that. You have to, you know, extract that from the universe and make it your own.

196
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,900
Yeah, like I get the presentation is like hipster art hoe who can't work,

197
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,300
but there's truth in this for sure. What?

198
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:07,400
What? Oh, my God.

199
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,300
The older part sounds kind of inappropriate.

200
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,700
So I'm going to stop the song there and keep it kid friendly for all my young followers out there.

201
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,700
This is kid friendly. Beautiful and stay kind.

202
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,300
Okay. Was that real or was that a troll?

203
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,800
Is this an actual person who thinks that they are a trans girl and they're little and cute?

204
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Or is this someone who is like specifically making a video like this to troll?

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
And I don't know, dude. I don't know.

206
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,600
The world is a weird fucking place nowadays, dude. I don't know.

207
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,300
Imagine going on a date. Oh, my God.

208
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,500
Got to get that perfect Instagram video for your food.

209
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,700
Oh, you know, I know that like I'm an influencer.

210
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,400
I know I know that's what I am, but I could never be someone like this.

211
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Oh, my God, influencers, people who actually behave like influencers.

212
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,800
They are just some of the worst, most self-absorbed fucking people in the world.

213
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it, dude.

214
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,900
I know like I'm out here making videos. You guys watch them.

215
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm technically an influencer, but like I'm if I count as one, I am ashamed to be one.

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,100
Okay. And that brings us to the end of TikTok Tuesday for today.

217
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,600
I hope you enjoyed. I know I missed a few working on the skullgirls video,

218
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,200
but hey, we're back. We're back in form.

219
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,900
Oh, and I announced this on the weekly set, but I'll announce it real quick here.

220
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,100
I'm going away for Christmas yet again. Sorry, but that's just that's the season,

221
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,200
you know, so I just came back from a Christmas travel.

222
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,900
I'm going to go away again for another family Christmas travel

223
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,500
and I'll pretty much be gone the final week of December.

224
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll try to I'll try to make some videos ahead of time

225
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,400
so that they can at least come out like while I'm gone, but I will I will not be present.

226
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,100
So I hope you all have a Merry Christmas or whatever other holiday you celebrate

227
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,100
and I will see you next time. Have a good one.

228
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,700
I love you.
