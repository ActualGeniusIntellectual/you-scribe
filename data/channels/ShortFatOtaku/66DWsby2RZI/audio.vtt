00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
Are there more differences between groups or within groups? The liberal answer is within groups,

00:04.960 --> 00:09.520
that differences between individuals are more vast than differences among groups of individuals.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.480
Here's an example. We know that there's a correlation of 0.6 regarding women being more

00:14.480 --> 00:18.960
agreeable than men. What this means is, if you have a group of women and a group of men,

00:18.960 --> 00:24.080
and you take a random person from each group and bet that the woman is more agreeable than the man,

00:24.080 --> 00:29.120
you'd be right 60% of the time. But there's enough overlap between men and women that 40%

00:29.120 --> 00:32.720
of the time, the man would be more agreeable. And the biological differences between men and

00:32.720 --> 00:37.520
women are much larger than, say, the biological differences between the races. This is why

00:37.520 --> 00:41.920
liberals are fundamentally individualists. They believe that there's more variation between

00:41.920 --> 00:46.720
individuals within racial groups than the groups themselves. And therefore, it's the individual

00:46.720 --> 00:50.320
that has a different temperament and point of view. It's the individual that generates the

00:50.320 --> 00:54.720
different ideas and solutions that society needs. The progressives believe the opposite.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.360
Their answer is between groups. They believe that differences between groups of people are larger

00:59.360 --> 01:03.840
than differences between individuals within that group. That two individuals from different groups

01:03.840 --> 01:08.320
have less in common with each other than any other random individual from their own group.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.480
In their view, any random white person will always have more in common with any other random

01:12.480 --> 01:17.360
white person than any random black person. This is why they consider diversity to be inherently

01:17.360 --> 01:21.680
moral. Because the only way to gain access to different ideas and points of view are through

01:21.680 --> 01:25.680
token inclusion of people from other groups. You need representation from a puerality of

01:25.680 --> 01:30.400
different races, ethnicities, sexualities, and whatever else, because their points of view are

01:30.400 --> 01:35.440
so unique that their inclusion is the only way to gain access to that knowledge. I think this is

01:35.440 --> 01:40.000
true to some very limited degree. A white person who's lived in a majority white country, in a

01:40.000 --> 01:44.560
majority white neighborhood, probably hasn't experienced too much racism, and may benefit

01:44.560 --> 01:49.280
from the knowledge of somebody who has. But the progressive point of view, that simply having

01:49.280 --> 01:54.000
black skin is enough to qualify the person as the keeper of that knowledge and the educator

01:54.000 --> 01:58.400
of the ignorant, even if the individual in question is quite privileged in other ways,

01:58.960 --> 02:04.720
seems to be a rather racist argument. In fact, the idea that there is more difference between

02:04.720 --> 02:10.400
the races than between the individual is one of the fundamental racist ideas. It's what the Nazis

02:10.400 --> 02:14.880
said when discussing the non-Aryans, it's what the KKK said when discussing black people, and it's

02:14.880 --> 02:19.760
what progressives say today, that you are so different from me due to your race that there is

02:19.760 --> 02:25.120
no common ground between us, and that you are so similar to all people within your race that now

02:25.120 --> 02:30.000
that I know what race you are, I know what kind of person you are. If that sounds racist to you,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.720
that's because it is. This idea of comparing progressives with racists isn't new, and the

02:34.720 --> 02:38.480
progressive tendency towards racism has been lampooned pretty consistently in the past few

02:38.480 --> 03:06.640
years. Yes, most white progressives are simply white supremacists with a guilty conscience.

03:06.640 --> 03:11.280
I've been reading D'Angelo's White Fragility, I knew I'd have to deal with this thing eventually,

03:11.280 --> 03:15.600
and she says as much in the book. She admits to being a white supremacist, she believes all

03:15.600 --> 03:20.000
white people are white supremacists by virtue of them being white, and that the only way to achieve

03:20.000 --> 03:24.240
black liberation is the constant, eternal shaming and restriction of all white people.

03:24.880 --> 03:29.200
Let's talk about open borders advocates, and if it seems like I'm suddenly shifting gears here,

03:29.200 --> 03:34.160
I'm really not. There's been a specific sect of politics on both the left and the right

03:34.160 --> 03:38.640
that has been entirely pro-open borders, pro-migration, and pro-globalism.

03:38.640 --> 03:43.440
On the left, there's a racial component to it. It's racist to not help those poor brown people

03:43.440 --> 03:47.600
into our country, they need our help, and we stole the land from them anyway. On the right,

03:47.600 --> 03:52.000
the attitude of big business is that it's good for the economy, meaning large corporations,

03:52.000 --> 03:57.280
to import foreign workers and drive labor costs down. Standing in the way of both of these pushes,

03:57.280 --> 04:02.560
however, is the nation-state itself. And because western politics has swung a bit more in the

04:02.560 --> 04:07.600
patriotic direction in the past five or so years, it's no surprise that both the legacy media,

04:07.600 --> 04:11.520
as well as the activists on the ground, have tried to reframe all nationalism,

04:11.520 --> 04:17.120
even civic nationalism, as evil and bigoted and fashy. After all, if we're all humans and we all

04:17.120 --> 04:21.280
have human rights, why would we prioritize one arbitrary group of people over another?

04:21.280 --> 04:26.320
Why not bring the underprivileged foreigners into the first world fold and benefit from their labor,

04:26.320 --> 04:29.920
especially since some of them will naturally be talented individuals that will finally have

04:29.920 --> 04:34.400
the chance to contribute in a big way with access to modern education? The liberal reply to such an

04:34.400 --> 04:39.120
argument, and to the entire open borders movement, is that the authority of the state ends at its

04:39.120 --> 04:43.920
borders. Borders provide a jurisdiction for laws to be in effect. Laws are the practical

04:43.920 --> 04:48.480
implementation and protection of the human rights of the citizens living within the state. With no

04:48.480 --> 04:53.840
borders there's no jurisdiction, no laws, and no universal human rights. After all, without a

04:53.840 --> 04:59.600
border, how do you know where your country's laws are in effect? Are they just in effect everywhere?

04:59.600 --> 05:04.400
That seems rather imperialist, as does allowing the best and brightest from foreign nations to

05:04.400 --> 05:08.560
move to western countries, leaving those nations with a massive brain drain that prevents them from

05:08.560 --> 05:14.080
building themselves up to our level of quality as well. Where imperialists once extracted resources,

05:14.080 --> 05:18.400
they now extract people, and progressives are happily leading the charge because it makes them

05:18.400 --> 05:24.240
feel moral. And with the exception of, like, extreme natural disasters or a genocidal government,

05:24.240 --> 05:28.320
it's not the moral responsibility of any nation to help the citizens of another nation.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.680
Those citizens have the responsibility to improve their own countries.

05:31.680 --> 05:36.720
Their responsibility lies within their borders, just as our responsibility lies within ours.

05:37.360 --> 05:42.720
Sovereignty extends only as far as territory does. But with no borders, no jurisdiction,

05:42.720 --> 05:48.560
no laws, and no human rights, how do progressives view law itself? They give a lot of lip service

05:48.560 --> 05:52.880
to the idea of human rights, of course. They talk about constantly making more things rights when

05:52.880 --> 05:56.640
they're really not. They talk about extending rights to people who they view don't have them,

05:56.640 --> 06:02.160
etc, etc. But what do the progressives actually do? What do they actually advocate for?

06:02.160 --> 06:06.400
Well, for example, one of the demands that came out of CHAS is a complete abolishment,

06:06.400 --> 06:11.120
not a demilitarization or a defunding, of the Seattle police. The justification for this is

06:11.120 --> 06:16.320
that the police are tools of the white supremacy, and that the community, meaning black people,

06:16.320 --> 06:20.720
should be policed by their own. As I said earlier, there's some limited logic to this.

06:20.720 --> 06:25.120
A force of white people who have never experienced racism, policing a community of people who have

06:25.120 --> 06:30.560
entirely different views, ideas, and problems may very well feel like an occupying force.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.800
But consider that black cops are regularly whitewashed as Uncle Toms or race traitors,

06:34.800 --> 06:40.080
or not being real black people. And it would seem that the progressive view of policing is that

06:40.080 --> 06:45.680
the practice itself is white. At the same time, progressives have entirely abandoned the idea of

06:45.680 --> 06:50.240
equality before the law. California's acts its equality laws in order to make affirmative action

06:50.240 --> 06:54.400
legal, and grant various minorities extra privileges in the state's hiring practices.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.320
And this sort of thing has been a long time coming. The shift within progressive circles

06:58.320 --> 07:03.040
has been away from equality and toward equity. Simply setting an equal playing field and letting

07:03.040 --> 07:08.800
equality rise to the surface is considered racist. In fact, by some radicals Martin Luther King Jr.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.120
would be a racist because he wanted black people to be judged by the content of their character

07:13.120 --> 07:18.160
and not the color of their skin. But now, the color of their skin is the only thing progressives

07:18.160 --> 07:23.440
care about. So it's no surprise to me that, to a lot of these people, universal application of

07:23.520 --> 07:28.720
human rights is now considered to be racist. It's the white man's law, don't you see? And

07:28.720 --> 07:33.360
non-white communities shouldn't be subject to it. This is entirely consistent with their worldview.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.040
They consider racial groups to be more different than the individuals within those groups.

07:37.040 --> 07:41.920
So why should the same laws apply? And one of the best ways to break that universal application,

07:41.920 --> 07:46.000
to break the law itself, is to break the jurisdiction over which it presides,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.680
the borders and the nation. But what will the progressives replace it with?

07:49.680 --> 07:52.960
In one of Steven Crowder's videos, one of his Change My Mind interviews I think,

07:53.520 --> 07:57.200
he talks to a German-born woman studying in the US regarding freedom of speech.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.880
Crowder's position is essentially the liberal one. All speech should be permitted,

08:00.880 --> 08:04.880
and you combat hate speech with debate just like you'd combat any other bad idea. And the woman

08:04.880 --> 08:10.960
appreciates that position as the liberal position, but she says that we Germans have a responsibility

08:10.960 --> 08:15.360
considering her country's history to think and behave differently. Now I don't know about you,

08:15.360 --> 08:20.480
but I'd never say we Canadians, and I doubt that the Americans or the Brits would say we Americans

08:20.480 --> 08:24.880
or we British, as if they somehow have the authority to speak for the entire nation.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.240
But when you believe in collectivism, when you believe that there are more differences between

08:28.240 --> 08:32.880
groups than between individuals, when you believe that all Germans are like you simply by virtue of

08:32.880 --> 08:37.680
being German, then you can speak with the authority of all of them. Similarly, during the Hong Kong

08:37.680 --> 08:41.760
protests, I remember seeing another video. This one was of a Chinese person ranting at the camera

08:41.760 --> 08:46.480
about how Western imperialists need to stay out of Chinese affairs, and how Hong Kong citizens

08:46.480 --> 08:50.560
need to remember that they are Chinese. This is actually a saying in Chinese,

08:50.560 --> 08:54.960
remember that you are Chinese. I've had Chinese girlfriends and lived with Chinese roommates,

08:54.960 --> 08:59.120
and they've all either said this themselves or were told it by others at one point.

08:59.120 --> 09:04.400
The idea is that Chinese culture is more important than the cultural standards, even sometimes the

09:04.400 --> 09:08.320
laws of the country that they've moved to. It didn't matter if other Canadians did things

09:08.320 --> 09:12.800
differently, they needed to remember that they were Chinese, and a different standard applied

09:12.800 --> 09:17.360
to them, even if they were entirely Westernized people. We've seen this collectivist attitude

09:17.360 --> 09:20.960
with more than Germany and China, we've seen it with Muslim immigrants, we've seen it with

09:20.960 --> 09:25.520
Latino immigrants, and so on. To them, it doesn't matter what authority the nation has over them,

09:25.520 --> 09:31.200
as citizens or immigrants, because they serve a higher authority based solely on their identity.

09:31.200 --> 09:36.080
And in the absence of borders, jurisdiction, laws, and rights, this is what the progressives

09:36.080 --> 09:40.720
would replace the universal standard with. A racial law that you can never escape from,

09:40.720 --> 09:44.720
where your group identity at birth is the sole determining factor of what standard you are held

09:44.720 --> 09:49.920
to, what rights you have, what laws are applied to you. And this horror show makes complete sense

09:49.920 --> 09:54.400
to the progressive worldview, because they see all individuals within a group as being similar

09:54.400 --> 09:59.520
enough that one token member can speak for all their concerns, and all groups being different

09:59.520 --> 10:04.000
enough that each one must be held to a different standard. Why do you think that things like open

10:04.000 --> 10:10.560
debate or meritocracy or even objectivity or science have been redefined as white culture,

10:10.560 --> 10:14.480
as things that progressives believe that non-whites should avoid in favor of their own

10:14.480 --> 10:19.680
cultural standards? Because if accurate ways of measuring the world are taken off the table as

10:19.680 --> 10:24.080
whiteness, then the subjectivity of different standards are all that we have left. Every time

10:24.080 --> 10:28.800
somebody tries to punctuate their point with, as a black person, as a gay man, as a trans woman,

10:28.800 --> 10:33.680
as a single mother, whatever else, this is the idea they're appealing to. That their specific

10:33.680 --> 10:37.840
group has its own standards, and that the universal treatment of all humans need not apply.

10:38.480 --> 10:43.200
Don't let them get away with it. We are all human, we are all equal before the law,

10:43.200 --> 10:49.280
and we are all free. Progressives, ironically enough, want the tribalism of the past to return,

10:49.280 --> 10:52.480
and that's something that all liberals have a moral obligation to oppose.
