1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Are there more differences between groups or within groups? The liberal answer is within groups,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,520
that differences between individuals are more vast than differences among groups of individuals.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,480
Here's an example. We know that there's a correlation of 0.6 regarding women being more

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
agreeable than men. What this means is, if you have a group of women and a group of men,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,080
and you take a random person from each group and bet that the woman is more agreeable than the man,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,120
you'd be right 60% of the time. But there's enough overlap between men and women that 40%

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,720
of the time, the man would be more agreeable. And the biological differences between men and

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,520
women are much larger than, say, the biological differences between the races. This is why

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
liberals are fundamentally individualists. They believe that there's more variation between

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,720
individuals within racial groups than the groups themselves. And therefore, it's the individual

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,320
that has a different temperament and point of view. It's the individual that generates the

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,720
different ideas and solutions that society needs. The progressives believe the opposite.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,360
Their answer is between groups. They believe that differences between groups of people are larger

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,840
than differences between individuals within that group. That two individuals from different groups

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
have less in common with each other than any other random individual from their own group.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,480
In their view, any random white person will always have more in common with any other random

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,360
white person than any random black person. This is why they consider diversity to be inherently

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
moral. Because the only way to gain access to different ideas and points of view are through

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
token inclusion of people from other groups. You need representation from a puerality of

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,400
different races, ethnicities, sexualities, and whatever else, because their points of view are

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,440
so unique that their inclusion is the only way to gain access to that knowledge. I think this is

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,000
true to some very limited degree. A white person who's lived in a majority white country, in a

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
majority white neighborhood, probably hasn't experienced too much racism, and may benefit

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,280
from the knowledge of somebody who has. But the progressive point of view, that simply having

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,000
black skin is enough to qualify the person as the keeper of that knowledge and the educator

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,400
of the ignorant, even if the individual in question is quite privileged in other ways,

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,720
seems to be a rather racist argument. In fact, the idea that there is more difference between

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,400
the races than between the individual is one of the fundamental racist ideas. It's what the Nazis

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,880
said when discussing the non-Aryans, it's what the KKK said when discussing black people, and it's

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,760
what progressives say today, that you are so different from me due to your race that there is

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,120
no common ground between us, and that you are so similar to all people within your race that now

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,000
that I know what race you are, I know what kind of person you are. If that sounds racist to you,

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,720
that's because it is. This idea of comparing progressives with racists isn't new, and the

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
progressive tendency towards racism has been lampooned pretty consistently in the past few

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:03:06,640
years. Yes, most white progressives are simply white supremacists with a guilty conscience.

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,280
I've been reading D'Angelo's White Fragility, I knew I'd have to deal with this thing eventually,

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,600
and she says as much in the book. She admits to being a white supremacist, she believes all

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,000
white people are white supremacists by virtue of them being white, and that the only way to achieve

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,240
black liberation is the constant, eternal shaming and restriction of all white people.

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,200
Let's talk about open borders advocates, and if it seems like I'm suddenly shifting gears here,

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,160
I'm really not. There's been a specific sect of politics on both the left and the right

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,640
that has been entirely pro-open borders, pro-migration, and pro-globalism.

43
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
On the left, there's a racial component to it. It's racist to not help those poor brown people

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,600
into our country, they need our help, and we stole the land from them anyway. On the right,

45
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,000
the attitude of big business is that it's good for the economy, meaning large corporations,

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,280
to import foreign workers and drive labor costs down. Standing in the way of both of these pushes,

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,560
however, is the nation-state itself. And because western politics has swung a bit more in the

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,600
patriotic direction in the past five or so years, it's no surprise that both the legacy media,

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,520
as well as the activists on the ground, have tried to reframe all nationalism,

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,120
even civic nationalism, as evil and bigoted and fashy. After all, if we're all humans and we all

51
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,280
have human rights, why would we prioritize one arbitrary group of people over another?

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,320
Why not bring the underprivileged foreigners into the first world fold and benefit from their labor,

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,920
especially since some of them will naturally be talented individuals that will finally have

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,400
the chance to contribute in a big way with access to modern education? The liberal reply to such an

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,120
argument, and to the entire open borders movement, is that the authority of the state ends at its

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,920
borders. Borders provide a jurisdiction for laws to be in effect. Laws are the practical

57
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,480
implementation and protection of the human rights of the citizens living within the state. With no

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,840
borders there's no jurisdiction, no laws, and no universal human rights. After all, without a

59
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,600
border, how do you know where your country's laws are in effect? Are they just in effect everywhere?

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,400
That seems rather imperialist, as does allowing the best and brightest from foreign nations to

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,560
move to western countries, leaving those nations with a massive brain drain that prevents them from

62
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,080
building themselves up to our level of quality as well. Where imperialists once extracted resources,

63
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,400
they now extract people, and progressives are happily leading the charge because it makes them

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,240
feel moral. And with the exception of, like, extreme natural disasters or a genocidal government,

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,320
it's not the moral responsibility of any nation to help the citizens of another nation.

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
Those citizens have the responsibility to improve their own countries.

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,720
Their responsibility lies within their borders, just as our responsibility lies within ours.

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,720
Sovereignty extends only as far as territory does. But with no borders, no jurisdiction,

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,560
no laws, and no human rights, how do progressives view law itself? They give a lot of lip service

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,880
to the idea of human rights, of course. They talk about constantly making more things rights when

71
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,640
they're really not. They talk about extending rights to people who they view don't have them,

72
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,160
etc, etc. But what do the progressives actually do? What do they actually advocate for?

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,400
Well, for example, one of the demands that came out of CHAS is a complete abolishment,

74
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,120
not a demilitarization or a defunding, of the Seattle police. The justification for this is

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,320
that the police are tools of the white supremacy, and that the community, meaning black people,

76
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,720
should be policed by their own. As I said earlier, there's some limited logic to this.

77
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,120
A force of white people who have never experienced racism, policing a community of people who have

78
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,560
entirely different views, ideas, and problems may very well feel like an occupying force.

79
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
But consider that black cops are regularly whitewashed as Uncle Toms or race traitors,

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,080
or not being real black people. And it would seem that the progressive view of policing is that

81
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,680
the practice itself is white. At the same time, progressives have entirely abandoned the idea of

82
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,240
equality before the law. California's acts its equality laws in order to make affirmative action

83
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,400
legal, and grant various minorities extra privileges in the state's hiring practices.

84
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,320
And this sort of thing has been a long time coming. The shift within progressive circles

85
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,040
has been away from equality and toward equity. Simply setting an equal playing field and letting

86
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,800
equality rise to the surface is considered racist. In fact, by some radicals Martin Luther King Jr.

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,120
would be a racist because he wanted black people to be judged by the content of their character

88
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,160
and not the color of their skin. But now, the color of their skin is the only thing progressives

89
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,440
care about. So it's no surprise to me that, to a lot of these people, universal application of

90
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,720
human rights is now considered to be racist. It's the white man's law, don't you see? And

91
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,360
non-white communities shouldn't be subject to it. This is entirely consistent with their worldview.

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,040
They consider racial groups to be more different than the individuals within those groups.

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,920
So why should the same laws apply? And one of the best ways to break that universal application,

94
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,000
to break the law itself, is to break the jurisdiction over which it presides,

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
the borders and the nation. But what will the progressives replace it with?

96
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,960
In one of Steven Crowder's videos, one of his Change My Mind interviews I think,

97
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,200
he talks to a German-born woman studying in the US regarding freedom of speech.

98
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,880
Crowder's position is essentially the liberal one. All speech should be permitted,

99
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,880
and you combat hate speech with debate just like you'd combat any other bad idea. And the woman

100
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,960
appreciates that position as the liberal position, but she says that we Germans have a responsibility

101
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,360
considering her country's history to think and behave differently. Now I don't know about you,

102
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,480
but I'd never say we Canadians, and I doubt that the Americans or the Brits would say we Americans

103
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,880
or we British, as if they somehow have the authority to speak for the entire nation.

104
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,240
But when you believe in collectivism, when you believe that there are more differences between

105
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
groups than between individuals, when you believe that all Germans are like you simply by virtue of

106
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,680
being German, then you can speak with the authority of all of them. Similarly, during the Hong Kong

107
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,760
protests, I remember seeing another video. This one was of a Chinese person ranting at the camera

108
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,480
about how Western imperialists need to stay out of Chinese affairs, and how Hong Kong citizens

109
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
need to remember that they are Chinese. This is actually a saying in Chinese,

110
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,960
remember that you are Chinese. I've had Chinese girlfriends and lived with Chinese roommates,

111
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,120
and they've all either said this themselves or were told it by others at one point.

112
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,400
The idea is that Chinese culture is more important than the cultural standards, even sometimes the

113
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,320
laws of the country that they've moved to. It didn't matter if other Canadians did things

114
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,800
differently, they needed to remember that they were Chinese, and a different standard applied

115
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,360
to them, even if they were entirely Westernized people. We've seen this collectivist attitude

116
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,960
with more than Germany and China, we've seen it with Muslim immigrants, we've seen it with

117
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,520
Latino immigrants, and so on. To them, it doesn't matter what authority the nation has over them,

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,200
as citizens or immigrants, because they serve a higher authority based solely on their identity.

119
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,080
And in the absence of borders, jurisdiction, laws, and rights, this is what the progressives

120
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,720
would replace the universal standard with. A racial law that you can never escape from,

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
where your group identity at birth is the sole determining factor of what standard you are held

122
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,920
to, what rights you have, what laws are applied to you. And this horror show makes complete sense

123
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,400
to the progressive worldview, because they see all individuals within a group as being similar

124
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,520
enough that one token member can speak for all their concerns, and all groups being different

125
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,000
enough that each one must be held to a different standard. Why do you think that things like open

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,560
debate or meritocracy or even objectivity or science have been redefined as white culture,

127
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,480
as things that progressives believe that non-whites should avoid in favor of their own

128
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,680
cultural standards? Because if accurate ways of measuring the world are taken off the table as

129
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,080
whiteness, then the subjectivity of different standards are all that we have left. Every time

130
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,800
somebody tries to punctuate their point with, as a black person, as a gay man, as a trans woman,

131
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,680
as a single mother, whatever else, this is the idea they're appealing to. That their specific

132
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,840
group has its own standards, and that the universal treatment of all humans need not apply.

133
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Don't let them get away with it. We are all human, we are all equal before the law,

134
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,280
and we are all free. Progressives, ironically enough, want the tribalism of the past to return,

135
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,480
and that's something that all liberals have a moral obligation to oppose.
