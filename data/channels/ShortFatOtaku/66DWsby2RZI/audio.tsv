0	4960	Are there more differences between groups or within groups? The liberal answer is within groups,
4960	9520	that differences between individuals are more vast than differences among groups of individuals.
9520	14480	Here's an example. We know that there's a correlation of 0.6 regarding women being more
14480	18960	agreeable than men. What this means is, if you have a group of women and a group of men,
18960	24080	and you take a random person from each group and bet that the woman is more agreeable than the man,
24080	29120	you'd be right 60% of the time. But there's enough overlap between men and women that 40%
29120	32720	of the time, the man would be more agreeable. And the biological differences between men and
32720	37520	women are much larger than, say, the biological differences between the races. This is why
37520	41920	liberals are fundamentally individualists. They believe that there's more variation between
41920	46720	individuals within racial groups than the groups themselves. And therefore, it's the individual
46720	50320	that has a different temperament and point of view. It's the individual that generates the
50320	54720	different ideas and solutions that society needs. The progressives believe the opposite.
54720	59360	Their answer is between groups. They believe that differences between groups of people are larger
59360	63840	than differences between individuals within that group. That two individuals from different groups
63840	68320	have less in common with each other than any other random individual from their own group.
68320	72480	In their view, any random white person will always have more in common with any other random
72480	77360	white person than any random black person. This is why they consider diversity to be inherently
77360	81680	moral. Because the only way to gain access to different ideas and points of view are through
81680	85680	token inclusion of people from other groups. You need representation from a puerality of
85680	90400	different races, ethnicities, sexualities, and whatever else, because their points of view are
90400	95440	so unique that their inclusion is the only way to gain access to that knowledge. I think this is
95440	100000	true to some very limited degree. A white person who's lived in a majority white country, in a
100000	104560	majority white neighborhood, probably hasn't experienced too much racism, and may benefit
104560	109280	from the knowledge of somebody who has. But the progressive point of view, that simply having
109280	114000	black skin is enough to qualify the person as the keeper of that knowledge and the educator
114000	118400	of the ignorant, even if the individual in question is quite privileged in other ways,
118960	124720	seems to be a rather racist argument. In fact, the idea that there is more difference between
124720	130400	the races than between the individual is one of the fundamental racist ideas. It's what the Nazis
130400	134880	said when discussing the non-Aryans, it's what the KKK said when discussing black people, and it's
134880	139760	what progressives say today, that you are so different from me due to your race that there is
139760	145120	no common ground between us, and that you are so similar to all people within your race that now
145120	150000	that I know what race you are, I know what kind of person you are. If that sounds racist to you,
150000	154720	that's because it is. This idea of comparing progressives with racists isn't new, and the
154720	158480	progressive tendency towards racism has been lampooned pretty consistently in the past few
158480	186640	years. Yes, most white progressives are simply white supremacists with a guilty conscience.
186640	191280	I've been reading D'Angelo's White Fragility, I knew I'd have to deal with this thing eventually,
191280	195600	and she says as much in the book. She admits to being a white supremacist, she believes all
195600	200000	white people are white supremacists by virtue of them being white, and that the only way to achieve
200000	204240	black liberation is the constant, eternal shaming and restriction of all white people.
204880	209200	Let's talk about open borders advocates, and if it seems like I'm suddenly shifting gears here,
209200	214160	I'm really not. There's been a specific sect of politics on both the left and the right
214160	218640	that has been entirely pro-open borders, pro-migration, and pro-globalism.
218640	223440	On the left, there's a racial component to it. It's racist to not help those poor brown people
223440	227600	into our country, they need our help, and we stole the land from them anyway. On the right,
227600	232000	the attitude of big business is that it's good for the economy, meaning large corporations,
232000	237280	to import foreign workers and drive labor costs down. Standing in the way of both of these pushes,
237280	242560	however, is the nation-state itself. And because western politics has swung a bit more in the
242560	247600	patriotic direction in the past five or so years, it's no surprise that both the legacy media,
247600	251520	as well as the activists on the ground, have tried to reframe all nationalism,
251520	257120	even civic nationalism, as evil and bigoted and fashy. After all, if we're all humans and we all
257120	261280	have human rights, why would we prioritize one arbitrary group of people over another?
261280	266320	Why not bring the underprivileged foreigners into the first world fold and benefit from their labor,
266320	269920	especially since some of them will naturally be talented individuals that will finally have
269920	274400	the chance to contribute in a big way with access to modern education? The liberal reply to such an
274400	279120	argument, and to the entire open borders movement, is that the authority of the state ends at its
279120	283920	borders. Borders provide a jurisdiction for laws to be in effect. Laws are the practical
283920	288480	implementation and protection of the human rights of the citizens living within the state. With no
288480	293840	borders there's no jurisdiction, no laws, and no universal human rights. After all, without a
293840	299600	border, how do you know where your country's laws are in effect? Are they just in effect everywhere?
299600	304400	That seems rather imperialist, as does allowing the best and brightest from foreign nations to
304400	308560	move to western countries, leaving those nations with a massive brain drain that prevents them from
308560	314080	building themselves up to our level of quality as well. Where imperialists once extracted resources,
314080	318400	they now extract people, and progressives are happily leading the charge because it makes them
318400	324240	feel moral. And with the exception of, like, extreme natural disasters or a genocidal government,
324240	328320	it's not the moral responsibility of any nation to help the citizens of another nation.
328320	331680	Those citizens have the responsibility to improve their own countries.
331680	336720	Their responsibility lies within their borders, just as our responsibility lies within ours.
337360	342720	Sovereignty extends only as far as territory does. But with no borders, no jurisdiction,
342720	348560	no laws, and no human rights, how do progressives view law itself? They give a lot of lip service
348560	352880	to the idea of human rights, of course. They talk about constantly making more things rights when
352880	356640	they're really not. They talk about extending rights to people who they view don't have them,
356640	362160	etc, etc. But what do the progressives actually do? What do they actually advocate for?
362160	366400	Well, for example, one of the demands that came out of CHAS is a complete abolishment,
366400	371120	not a demilitarization or a defunding, of the Seattle police. The justification for this is
371120	376320	that the police are tools of the white supremacy, and that the community, meaning black people,
376320	380720	should be policed by their own. As I said earlier, there's some limited logic to this.
380720	385120	A force of white people who have never experienced racism, policing a community of people who have
385120	390560	entirely different views, ideas, and problems may very well feel like an occupying force.
390560	394800	But consider that black cops are regularly whitewashed as Uncle Toms or race traitors,
394800	400080	or not being real black people. And it would seem that the progressive view of policing is that
400080	405680	the practice itself is white. At the same time, progressives have entirely abandoned the idea of
405680	410240	equality before the law. California's acts its equality laws in order to make affirmative action
410240	414400	legal, and grant various minorities extra privileges in the state's hiring practices.
414880	418320	And this sort of thing has been a long time coming. The shift within progressive circles
418320	423040	has been away from equality and toward equity. Simply setting an equal playing field and letting
423040	428800	equality rise to the surface is considered racist. In fact, by some radicals Martin Luther King Jr.
428800	433120	would be a racist because he wanted black people to be judged by the content of their character
433120	438160	and not the color of their skin. But now, the color of their skin is the only thing progressives
438160	443440	care about. So it's no surprise to me that, to a lot of these people, universal application of
443520	448720	human rights is now considered to be racist. It's the white man's law, don't you see? And
448720	453360	non-white communities shouldn't be subject to it. This is entirely consistent with their worldview.
453360	457040	They consider racial groups to be more different than the individuals within those groups.
457040	461920	So why should the same laws apply? And one of the best ways to break that universal application,
461920	466000	to break the law itself, is to break the jurisdiction over which it presides,
466000	469680	the borders and the nation. But what will the progressives replace it with?
469680	472960	In one of Steven Crowder's videos, one of his Change My Mind interviews I think,
473520	477200	he talks to a German-born woman studying in the US regarding freedom of speech.
477200	480880	Crowder's position is essentially the liberal one. All speech should be permitted,
480880	484880	and you combat hate speech with debate just like you'd combat any other bad idea. And the woman
484880	490960	appreciates that position as the liberal position, but she says that we Germans have a responsibility
490960	495360	considering her country's history to think and behave differently. Now I don't know about you,
495360	500480	but I'd never say we Canadians, and I doubt that the Americans or the Brits would say we Americans
500480	504880	or we British, as if they somehow have the authority to speak for the entire nation.
504880	508240	But when you believe in collectivism, when you believe that there are more differences between
508240	512880	groups than between individuals, when you believe that all Germans are like you simply by virtue of
512880	517680	being German, then you can speak with the authority of all of them. Similarly, during the Hong Kong
517680	521760	protests, I remember seeing another video. This one was of a Chinese person ranting at the camera
521760	526480	about how Western imperialists need to stay out of Chinese affairs, and how Hong Kong citizens
526480	530560	need to remember that they are Chinese. This is actually a saying in Chinese,
530560	534960	remember that you are Chinese. I've had Chinese girlfriends and lived with Chinese roommates,
534960	539120	and they've all either said this themselves or were told it by others at one point.
539120	544400	The idea is that Chinese culture is more important than the cultural standards, even sometimes the
544400	548320	laws of the country that they've moved to. It didn't matter if other Canadians did things
548320	552800	differently, they needed to remember that they were Chinese, and a different standard applied
552800	557360	to them, even if they were entirely Westernized people. We've seen this collectivist attitude
557360	560960	with more than Germany and China, we've seen it with Muslim immigrants, we've seen it with
560960	565520	Latino immigrants, and so on. To them, it doesn't matter what authority the nation has over them,
565520	571200	as citizens or immigrants, because they serve a higher authority based solely on their identity.
571200	576080	And in the absence of borders, jurisdiction, laws, and rights, this is what the progressives
576080	580720	would replace the universal standard with. A racial law that you can never escape from,
580720	584720	where your group identity at birth is the sole determining factor of what standard you are held
584720	589920	to, what rights you have, what laws are applied to you. And this horror show makes complete sense
589920	594400	to the progressive worldview, because they see all individuals within a group as being similar
594400	599520	enough that one token member can speak for all their concerns, and all groups being different
599520	604000	enough that each one must be held to a different standard. Why do you think that things like open
604000	610560	debate or meritocracy or even objectivity or science have been redefined as white culture,
610560	614480	as things that progressives believe that non-whites should avoid in favor of their own
614480	619680	cultural standards? Because if accurate ways of measuring the world are taken off the table as
619680	624080	whiteness, then the subjectivity of different standards are all that we have left. Every time
624080	628800	somebody tries to punctuate their point with, as a black person, as a gay man, as a trans woman,
628800	633680	as a single mother, whatever else, this is the idea they're appealing to. That their specific
633680	637840	group has its own standards, and that the universal treatment of all humans need not apply.
638480	643200	Don't let them get away with it. We are all human, we are all equal before the law,
643200	649280	and we are all free. Progressives, ironically enough, want the tribalism of the past to return,
649280	652480	and that's something that all liberals have a moral obligation to oppose.
