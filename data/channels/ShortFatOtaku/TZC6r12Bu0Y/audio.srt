1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180
In the last video, I mentioned there's a section of the left that, despite their advocacy

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,660
for safe spaces, simultaneously believes the personal is political, and so there can be

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,960
no safe spaces from politics.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,900
The idea of a safe space began on school campuses, back in the day where schools were not explicitly

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,940
pro-LGBTQIABRAAP plus in every possible way.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,420
Back then, your local campus pride center would have been named the Straight Gay Alliance

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,420
Club instead, reflecting an approach that is actually more conciliatory between gay

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,900
and straight people, rather than openly and obnoxiously shouting your gayness at everyone

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,980
as pride seems to suggest.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,300
But nonetheless, in a time where gay or lesbian couples might actually get bullied for being

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,220
publicly but still appropriately romantic, the first safe spaces were simply lounges

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,340
where gay or lesbian couples could go to be at peace.

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,340
Casual hugs or kisses were allowed for straight couples, but gay couples would actually get

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,260
jeers or weird looks back then.

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,180
I personally remember it happening at least once, so the point of the safe space is that

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,220
they could go there and socialize and not be judged.

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,820
It was a modern, non-alcoholic interpretation of the gay bar, basically.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,020
Personally, I didn't find this objectionable.

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,640
I mean, I don't think people should be shit on for appropriate public displays of affection

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,180
in general, but the idea of a gay lounge makes as much sense to me as a men's lounge or

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,340
a woman's lounge or a black club or, yes, a white club.

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,500
People can choose to self-segregate or integrate as they like, in my opinion, as long as the

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,900
options for both are still on the table.

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,380
Of course, the problem with the safe space is when people spend all their time in one

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,780
in order to avoid actually engaging with the larger world.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,460
When you seal yourself into an echo chamber full of yes-men, that can't be good.

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,940
And at the same time, when you start to expand your safe space, that can also be an issue.

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,160
If the entirety of society becomes a safe space where your politics are catered to and

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,980
other views are curtailed, that's no different than living in a world where your views are

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
banned.

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,620
Same thing, just in the inverse.

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,700
If universities are meant to be places where intellectual development is fostered, where

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,820
ideas, even controversial ones, are rigorously discussed, where people experiment with new

34
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,840
modes of thought and ways of living, making the entirety of campus a safe space hampers

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,980
this goal.

36
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,460
Growth and discovery are not safe endeavors.

37
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,260
They cannot happen in a safe space.

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,000
It's no surprise, therefore, that psychologists are beginning to realize that safe spaces

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,840
might actually be damaging to people's mental health.

40
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,980
In the article Safe Spaces Can Be Dangerous, Liz Swann writes,

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,740
During my recent teaching career, I was faced with a dilemma of either gently pushing a

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,060
student to grow as a person or allowing her to remain stuck in her safe little cocoon.

43
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,740
What made it a tricky dilemma was that my superior at the time fully supported the second

44
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,100
option, that is, allowing this young woman to remain safely neurotic and developmentally

45
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,380
stunted in her fear, which in this case was public speaking.

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,960
While my first instinct was to say, come on, suck it up, it's good practice, it's good

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,700
for your grade, something urged me to seek counsel from an administrator in charge, as

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,660
it was my first time teaching in this unit.

49
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,860
I explained my position.

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,600
Encouraging this student to suffer her two minutes in front of her classmates would serve

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
her well in the long run.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,180
She would realize that she didn't die of a heart attack or throw up in the classroom

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,220
out of nervousness, and then, just like magic, it would be easier the next time.

54
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,860
She'd have grown as a person.

55
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,560
Unfortunately, the administrator didn't see it that way.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,260
He worried that making her fulfill this assignment would cause her undue stress and hardship

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,580
and make her want to drop the class, and even, he worried, drop out of college.

58
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,740
Much to my surprise, I showed up the day of the debate early with coffee in hand, and

59
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,020
there she was, sitting at the table, ready to go.

60
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,840
Okay, I thought, this looks promising.

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,740
The debate went well, with the star of the show giving her defense with confidence, poise,

62
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,960
and a smile on her face.

63
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,360
If she was freaking out on the inside, no one could tell, not even me.

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,020
She got full credit for the assignment, and her classmates and teammates presumably never

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,740
knew she had been considering bailing on them at the last minute.

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,180
Curiously, after that class, she came out of her shell, volunteering to go up to the

67
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,520
board when the class was brainstorming, telling jokes in class, and bursting with confidence.

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,340
The transformation was amazing.

69
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,340
It was the result I was hoping for.

70
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,340
The trigger warning is the inverse of the safe space.

71
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,180
While the safe space is a location where upsetting content is not allowed, the trigger warning

72
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,900
lets people know that the location explicitly has upsetting content.

73
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,260
And the internet is chock full of laughs revolving around trigger warnings.

74
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,780
Just search YouTube for the word triggered, and you'll find thousands upon thousands

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,440
of YouTube videos detailing triggered feminists, triggered SJWs, triggered progressives, screaming

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,720
at Ben Shapiro and smarmy conservatives and facts and logic.

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,900
And holy shit, I can't believe these videos still get made today.

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,280
A psychological trigger is a stimuli that may mentally bring somebody back to a period

79
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,660
of intense trauma.

80
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,360
Before the terminally online woke brigade got a hold of the term, it was most commonly

81
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,820
used to describe the experience of a shell-shocked war veteran who may encounter a sound or a

82
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,980
smell that brings a rush of emotion, reminding them of some extremely stressful event from

83
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
their time at war.

84
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,980
It doesn't have to be vets though, people who experienced rape or witnessed the death

85
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,620
of somebody can have the same reaction.

86
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,780
The original purpose of the trigger warning was to let people know that what they were

87
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,020
about to experience contained a common enough trigger, a loud bang or something, that a

88
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,780
shell-shocked person or a victim of abuse might have a psychotic break if they were

89
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,880
to experience it.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,300
The only problem is, trigger warnings don't actually work.

91
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,820
The evidence is in on this.

92
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,020
Trigger warnings don't actually cushion the blow of disturbing content, they actually

93
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,700
teach people to expect it, allowing them to have their psychotic break earlier and harder.

94
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,980
It conditions them, Pavlov's dog style, to have a worse episode than they otherwise would

95
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,980
have had.

96
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,140
We already know what helps with these types of conditions, and that's voluntarily confronting

97
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,380
them repeatedly over a long period of time until you're so bored with the situation

98
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,660
it can't possibly trigger you, not making them worse by dangling them in front of you.

99
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,480
And the worst part is, there's actually evidence that trigger warnings themselves

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,620
create a triggered response.

101
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,940
Let's say you find something slightly unsettling.

102
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
Here, here's a great example.

103
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Trigger warning, Nazism.

104
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,820
Don't want to bust anyone's bubbles, but Heisenberg from Resident Evil 8 is a Nazi.

105
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,740
He's got the Wehrmacht dog tags.

106
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,220
Well, no shit.

107
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,300
A villain in a video game who is a timeless being living in Eastern Europe might have

108
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,020
had a past with the Nazis?

109
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,220
You know he's a villain, right?

110
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,220
I'm sorry that Marvel and Disney and Star Wars have conditioned you to believe that

111
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,260
the hot guy who's kind of a dark, brooding oppositional figure to the hero is just masturbatory

112
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,900
material, but yes, villains can actually be evil.

113
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,420
The point is, though, if you're somebody who finds Nazism and Nazi imagery slightly

114
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,760
unsettling, seeing trigger warning Nazism constantly anytime Nazis come up is actually

115
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,060
more likely to make you more triggered at Nazis than if there were no trigger warnings

116
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
at all.

117
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,380
Most things create new trauma.

118
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,180
It's been my experience that, for better or worse, people that survive messed up backgrounds

119
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,100
oftentimes possess a decent depth of character that those from more privileged backgrounds

120
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
don't have.

121
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,220
Rather than working on making themselves more interesting or likeable or experienced, people

122
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,060
will instead invent more and more fantastic backstories or qualities in order to add a

123
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,460
fake depth to themselves.

124
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,100
I think that's where a lot of the stupid twitter tags and bios come from.

125
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,780
Where a lot of the imaginary or heavily trumped up or glorified mental illness shit comes

126
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
from.

127
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,260
Where the neo pronouns or the they them women who are 100% femme and have nothing masculine

128
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,400
about them come from.

129
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,700
All of that garbage.

130
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,660
People want to be unique and different, and I'm not going to call them snowflakes, it

131
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,620
actually is possible to be unique and different, but they don't want to put in the work to

132
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,340
become that, so instead they just make stuff up.

133
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,940
And so now you've got people segregating themselves into ever smaller and more minute

134
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,380
sexualities and identities and whatever the fuck else in order to feel cool and unique

135
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,260
and try to get even just a drop of meaning in their lives because they've got it so

136
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,980
good in the modern era that they're not out there fighting for survival or doing any

137
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,580
manual labor, they've become nothing more than mindless soulless consumers and calling

138
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,180
themselves a he they sapiosexual with demi queer characteristics who believes in postmodern

139
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,740
neo trotskyist thought or whatever the fuck provides just enough of a facsimile of a real

140
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,260
fucking life that they can stave off the existential emptiness in their souls for one

141
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
more day.

142
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,800
But hey, you know what?

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,820
There is at least one cool thing about these trigger warnings.

144
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,540
Because of their current popularity, we're actually likely to see a return of those bomb-ass

145
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,860
splash screens at the beginning of survival horror games that really helped set the mood.

146
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,340
There are violent and disturbing images in this game, sign me the fuck up man.

147
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,020
Alright that about does it for me for today.

148
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,700
Yes, it's a shorter video to tide you over, I've got some more big ones planned soon,

149
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
don't you worry.

150
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,100
As always, I'm streaming this evening twitch.tv slash game boomers, make sure you're there.

151
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,700
Alright guys, I'll see you tonight.

152
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,260
Have a good day, I love you.
