0	10180	In the last video, I mentioned there's a section of the left that, despite their advocacy
10180	15660	for safe spaces, simultaneously believes the personal is political, and so there can be
15660	17960	no safe spaces from politics.
17960	23900	The idea of a safe space began on school campuses, back in the day where schools were not explicitly
23900	29940	pro-LGBTQIABRAAP plus in every possible way.
29940	34420	Back then, your local campus pride center would have been named the Straight Gay Alliance
34420	38420	Club instead, reflecting an approach that is actually more conciliatory between gay
38420	42900	and straight people, rather than openly and obnoxiously shouting your gayness at everyone
42900	44980	as pride seems to suggest.
44980	49300	But nonetheless, in a time where gay or lesbian couples might actually get bullied for being
49300	55220	publicly but still appropriately romantic, the first safe spaces were simply lounges
55220	58340	where gay or lesbian couples could go to be at peace.
58340	62340	Casual hugs or kisses were allowed for straight couples, but gay couples would actually get
62340	64260	jeers or weird looks back then.
64260	68180	I personally remember it happening at least once, so the point of the safe space is that
68180	71220	they could go there and socialize and not be judged.
71220	74820	It was a modern, non-alcoholic interpretation of the gay bar, basically.
74820	77020	Personally, I didn't find this objectionable.
77020	81640	I mean, I don't think people should be shit on for appropriate public displays of affection
81640	86180	in general, but the idea of a gay lounge makes as much sense to me as a men's lounge or
86180	90340	a woman's lounge or a black club or, yes, a white club.
90340	94500	People can choose to self-segregate or integrate as they like, in my opinion, as long as the
94500	96900	options for both are still on the table.
96900	100380	Of course, the problem with the safe space is when people spend all their time in one
100380	103780	in order to avoid actually engaging with the larger world.
103780	107460	When you seal yourself into an echo chamber full of yes-men, that can't be good.
107460	111940	And at the same time, when you start to expand your safe space, that can also be an issue.
111940	116160	If the entirety of society becomes a safe space where your politics are catered to and
116160	119980	other views are curtailed, that's no different than living in a world where your views are
119980	120980	banned.
120980	122620	Same thing, just in the inverse.
122620	126700	If universities are meant to be places where intellectual development is fostered, where
126700	131820	ideas, even controversial ones, are rigorously discussed, where people experiment with new
131820	136840	modes of thought and ways of living, making the entirety of campus a safe space hampers
136840	137980	this goal.
137980	140460	Growth and discovery are not safe endeavors.
140460	143260	They cannot happen in a safe space.
143260	147000	It's no surprise, therefore, that psychologists are beginning to realize that safe spaces
147000	149840	might actually be damaging to people's mental health.
149840	153980	In the article Safe Spaces Can Be Dangerous, Liz Swann writes,
153980	157740	During my recent teaching career, I was faced with a dilemma of either gently pushing a
157740	162060	student to grow as a person or allowing her to remain stuck in her safe little cocoon.
162060	166740	What made it a tricky dilemma was that my superior at the time fully supported the second
166740	171100	option, that is, allowing this young woman to remain safely neurotic and developmentally
171100	174380	stunted in her fear, which in this case was public speaking.
174380	177960	While my first instinct was to say, come on, suck it up, it's good practice, it's good
177960	181700	for your grade, something urged me to seek counsel from an administrator in charge, as
181700	183660	it was my first time teaching in this unit.
183660	184860	I explained my position.
184860	188600	Encouraging this student to suffer her two minutes in front of her classmates would serve
188600	190000	her well in the long run.
190000	193180	She would realize that she didn't die of a heart attack or throw up in the classroom
193180	197220	out of nervousness, and then, just like magic, it would be easier the next time.
197220	198860	She'd have grown as a person.
198860	201560	Unfortunately, the administrator didn't see it that way.
201560	206260	He worried that making her fulfill this assignment would cause her undue stress and hardship
206260	210580	and make her want to drop the class, and even, he worried, drop out of college.
210580	214740	Much to my surprise, I showed up the day of the debate early with coffee in hand, and
214740	217020	there she was, sitting at the table, ready to go.
217020	218840	Okay, I thought, this looks promising.
218840	222740	The debate went well, with the star of the show giving her defense with confidence, poise,
222740	223960	and a smile on her face.
223960	227360	If she was freaking out on the inside, no one could tell, not even me.
227360	231020	She got full credit for the assignment, and her classmates and teammates presumably never
231020	233740	knew she had been considering bailing on them at the last minute.
233740	237180	Curiously, after that class, she came out of her shell, volunteering to go up to the
237180	241520	board when the class was brainstorming, telling jokes in class, and bursting with confidence.
241520	243340	The transformation was amazing.
243340	245340	It was the result I was hoping for.
245340	248340	The trigger warning is the inverse of the safe space.
248340	252180	While the safe space is a location where upsetting content is not allowed, the trigger warning
252180	255900	lets people know that the location explicitly has upsetting content.
255900	259260	And the internet is chock full of laughs revolving around trigger warnings.
259260	262780	Just search YouTube for the word triggered, and you'll find thousands upon thousands
262780	267440	of YouTube videos detailing triggered feminists, triggered SJWs, triggered progressives, screaming
267440	270720	at Ben Shapiro and smarmy conservatives and facts and logic.
270720	273900	And holy shit, I can't believe these videos still get made today.
273900	278280	A psychological trigger is a stimuli that may mentally bring somebody back to a period
278280	279660	of intense trauma.
279660	283360	Before the terminally online woke brigade got a hold of the term, it was most commonly
283360	287820	used to describe the experience of a shell-shocked war veteran who may encounter a sound or a
287820	291980	smell that brings a rush of emotion, reminding them of some extremely stressful event from
291980	292980	their time at war.
292980	295980	It doesn't have to be vets though, people who experienced rape or witnessed the death
295980	297620	of somebody can have the same reaction.
297620	300780	The original purpose of the trigger warning was to let people know that what they were
300780	305020	about to experience contained a common enough trigger, a loud bang or something, that a
305020	308780	shell-shocked person or a victim of abuse might have a psychotic break if they were
308780	309880	to experience it.
309880	312300	The only problem is, trigger warnings don't actually work.
312300	313820	The evidence is in on this.
313820	317020	Trigger warnings don't actually cushion the blow of disturbing content, they actually
317020	321700	teach people to expect it, allowing them to have their psychotic break earlier and harder.
321700	325980	It conditions them, Pavlov's dog style, to have a worse episode than they otherwise would
325980	326980	have had.
326980	330140	We already know what helps with these types of conditions, and that's voluntarily confronting
330140	334380	them repeatedly over a long period of time until you're so bored with the situation
334380	338660	it can't possibly trigger you, not making them worse by dangling them in front of you.
338660	342480	And the worst part is, there's actually evidence that trigger warnings themselves
342480	344620	create a triggered response.
344620	346940	Let's say you find something slightly unsettling.
346940	348940	Here, here's a great example.
348940	349940	Trigger warning, Nazism.
349940	354820	Don't want to bust anyone's bubbles, but Heisenberg from Resident Evil 8 is a Nazi.
354820	356740	He's got the Wehrmacht dog tags.
356740	358220	Well, no shit.
358220	362300	A villain in a video game who is a timeless being living in Eastern Europe might have
362300	364020	had a past with the Nazis?
364020	365220	You know he's a villain, right?
365220	369220	I'm sorry that Marvel and Disney and Star Wars have conditioned you to believe that
369220	374260	the hot guy who's kind of a dark, brooding oppositional figure to the hero is just masturbatory
374260	377900	material, but yes, villains can actually be evil.
377900	382420	The point is, though, if you're somebody who finds Nazism and Nazi imagery slightly
382420	387760	unsettling, seeing trigger warning Nazism constantly anytime Nazis come up is actually
387760	392060	more likely to make you more triggered at Nazis than if there were no trigger warnings
392060	393060	at all.
393060	395380	Most things create new trauma.
395380	400180	It's been my experience that, for better or worse, people that survive messed up backgrounds
400180	405100	oftentimes possess a decent depth of character that those from more privileged backgrounds
405100	406100	don't have.
406100	410220	Rather than working on making themselves more interesting or likeable or experienced, people
410220	415060	will instead invent more and more fantastic backstories or qualities in order to add a
415060	416460	fake depth to themselves.
416460	420100	I think that's where a lot of the stupid twitter tags and bios come from.
420100	424780	Where a lot of the imaginary or heavily trumped up or glorified mental illness shit comes
424780	425780	from.
425780	430260	Where the neo pronouns or the they them women who are 100% femme and have nothing masculine
430260	431400	about them come from.
431400	432700	All of that garbage.
432700	435660	People want to be unique and different, and I'm not going to call them snowflakes, it
435660	439620	actually is possible to be unique and different, but they don't want to put in the work to
439620	442340	become that, so instead they just make stuff up.
442340	445940	And so now you've got people segregating themselves into ever smaller and more minute
445940	450380	sexualities and identities and whatever the fuck else in order to feel cool and unique
450380	454260	and try to get even just a drop of meaning in their lives because they've got it so
454260	457980	good in the modern era that they're not out there fighting for survival or doing any
457980	462580	manual labor, they've become nothing more than mindless soulless consumers and calling
462580	468180	themselves a he they sapiosexual with demi queer characteristics who believes in postmodern
468180	472740	neo trotskyist thought or whatever the fuck provides just enough of a facsimile of a real
472740	476260	fucking life that they can stave off the existential emptiness in their souls for one
476260	477260	more day.
477260	478800	But hey, you know what?
478800	481820	There is at least one cool thing about these trigger warnings.
481820	485540	Because of their current popularity, we're actually likely to see a return of those bomb-ass
485540	489860	splash screens at the beginning of survival horror games that really helped set the mood.
489860	494340	There are violent and disturbing images in this game, sign me the fuck up man.
494340	496020	Alright that about does it for me for today.
496020	499700	Yes, it's a shorter video to tide you over, I've got some more big ones planned soon,
499700	500700	don't you worry.
500700	505100	As always, I'm streaming this evening twitch.tv slash game boomers, make sure you're there.
505100	506700	Alright guys, I'll see you tonight.
506700	508260	Have a good day, I love you.
