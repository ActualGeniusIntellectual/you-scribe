00:00.000 --> 00:10.180
In the last video, I mentioned there's a section of the left that, despite their advocacy

00:10.180 --> 00:15.660
for safe spaces, simultaneously believes the personal is political, and so there can be

00:15.660 --> 00:17.960
no safe spaces from politics.

00:17.960 --> 00:23.900
The idea of a safe space began on school campuses, back in the day where schools were not explicitly

00:23.900 --> 00:29.940
pro-LGBTQIABRAAP plus in every possible way.

00:29.940 --> 00:34.420
Back then, your local campus pride center would have been named the Straight Gay Alliance

00:34.420 --> 00:38.420
Club instead, reflecting an approach that is actually more conciliatory between gay

00:38.420 --> 00:42.900
and straight people, rather than openly and obnoxiously shouting your gayness at everyone

00:42.900 --> 00:44.980
as pride seems to suggest.

00:44.980 --> 00:49.300
But nonetheless, in a time where gay or lesbian couples might actually get bullied for being

00:49.300 --> 00:55.220
publicly but still appropriately romantic, the first safe spaces were simply lounges

00:55.220 --> 00:58.340
where gay or lesbian couples could go to be at peace.

00:58.340 --> 01:02.340
Casual hugs or kisses were allowed for straight couples, but gay couples would actually get

01:02.340 --> 01:04.260
jeers or weird looks back then.

01:04.260 --> 01:08.180
I personally remember it happening at least once, so the point of the safe space is that

01:08.180 --> 01:11.220
they could go there and socialize and not be judged.

01:11.220 --> 01:14.820
It was a modern, non-alcoholic interpretation of the gay bar, basically.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.020
Personally, I didn't find this objectionable.

01:17.020 --> 01:21.640
I mean, I don't think people should be shit on for appropriate public displays of affection

01:21.640 --> 01:26.180
in general, but the idea of a gay lounge makes as much sense to me as a men's lounge or

01:26.180 --> 01:30.340
a woman's lounge or a black club or, yes, a white club.

01:30.340 --> 01:34.500
People can choose to self-segregate or integrate as they like, in my opinion, as long as the

01:34.500 --> 01:36.900
options for both are still on the table.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.380
Of course, the problem with the safe space is when people spend all their time in one

01:40.380 --> 01:43.780
in order to avoid actually engaging with the larger world.

01:43.780 --> 01:47.460
When you seal yourself into an echo chamber full of yes-men, that can't be good.

01:47.460 --> 01:51.940
And at the same time, when you start to expand your safe space, that can also be an issue.

01:51.940 --> 01:56.160
If the entirety of society becomes a safe space where your politics are catered to and

01:56.160 --> 01:59.980
other views are curtailed, that's no different than living in a world where your views are

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
banned.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.620
Same thing, just in the inverse.

02:02.620 --> 02:06.700
If universities are meant to be places where intellectual development is fostered, where

02:06.700 --> 02:11.820
ideas, even controversial ones, are rigorously discussed, where people experiment with new

02:11.820 --> 02:16.840
modes of thought and ways of living, making the entirety of campus a safe space hampers

02:16.840 --> 02:17.980
this goal.

02:17.980 --> 02:20.460
Growth and discovery are not safe endeavors.

02:20.460 --> 02:23.260
They cannot happen in a safe space.

02:23.260 --> 02:27.000
It's no surprise, therefore, that psychologists are beginning to realize that safe spaces

02:27.000 --> 02:29.840
might actually be damaging to people's mental health.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.980
In the article Safe Spaces Can Be Dangerous, Liz Swann writes,

02:33.980 --> 02:37.740
During my recent teaching career, I was faced with a dilemma of either gently pushing a

02:37.740 --> 02:42.060
student to grow as a person or allowing her to remain stuck in her safe little cocoon.

02:42.060 --> 02:46.740
What made it a tricky dilemma was that my superior at the time fully supported the second

02:46.740 --> 02:51.100
option, that is, allowing this young woman to remain safely neurotic and developmentally

02:51.100 --> 02:54.380
stunted in her fear, which in this case was public speaking.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.960
While my first instinct was to say, come on, suck it up, it's good practice, it's good

02:57.960 --> 03:01.700
for your grade, something urged me to seek counsel from an administrator in charge, as

03:01.700 --> 03:03.660
it was my first time teaching in this unit.

03:03.660 --> 03:04.860
I explained my position.

03:04.860 --> 03:08.600
Encouraging this student to suffer her two minutes in front of her classmates would serve

03:08.600 --> 03:10.000
her well in the long run.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.180
She would realize that she didn't die of a heart attack or throw up in the classroom

03:13.180 --> 03:17.220
out of nervousness, and then, just like magic, it would be easier the next time.

03:17.220 --> 03:18.860
She'd have grown as a person.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.560
Unfortunately, the administrator didn't see it that way.

03:21.560 --> 03:26.260
He worried that making her fulfill this assignment would cause her undue stress and hardship

03:26.260 --> 03:30.580
and make her want to drop the class, and even, he worried, drop out of college.

03:30.580 --> 03:34.740
Much to my surprise, I showed up the day of the debate early with coffee in hand, and

03:34.740 --> 03:37.020
there she was, sitting at the table, ready to go.

03:37.020 --> 03:38.840
Okay, I thought, this looks promising.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.740
The debate went well, with the star of the show giving her defense with confidence, poise,

03:42.740 --> 03:43.960
and a smile on her face.

03:43.960 --> 03:47.360
If she was freaking out on the inside, no one could tell, not even me.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.020
She got full credit for the assignment, and her classmates and teammates presumably never

03:51.020 --> 03:53.740
knew she had been considering bailing on them at the last minute.

03:53.740 --> 03:57.180
Curiously, after that class, she came out of her shell, volunteering to go up to the

03:57.180 --> 04:01.520
board when the class was brainstorming, telling jokes in class, and bursting with confidence.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.340
The transformation was amazing.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.340
It was the result I was hoping for.

04:05.340 --> 04:08.340
The trigger warning is the inverse of the safe space.

04:08.340 --> 04:12.180
While the safe space is a location where upsetting content is not allowed, the trigger warning

04:12.180 --> 04:15.900
lets people know that the location explicitly has upsetting content.

04:15.900 --> 04:19.260
And the internet is chock full of laughs revolving around trigger warnings.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.780
Just search YouTube for the word triggered, and you'll find thousands upon thousands

04:22.780 --> 04:27.440
of YouTube videos detailing triggered feminists, triggered SJWs, triggered progressives, screaming

04:27.440 --> 04:30.720
at Ben Shapiro and smarmy conservatives and facts and logic.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.900
And holy shit, I can't believe these videos still get made today.

04:33.900 --> 04:38.280
A psychological trigger is a stimuli that may mentally bring somebody back to a period

04:38.280 --> 04:39.660
of intense trauma.

04:39.660 --> 04:43.360
Before the terminally online woke brigade got a hold of the term, it was most commonly

04:43.360 --> 04:47.820
used to describe the experience of a shell-shocked war veteran who may encounter a sound or a

04:47.820 --> 04:51.980
smell that brings a rush of emotion, reminding them of some extremely stressful event from

04:51.980 --> 04:52.980
their time at war.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.980
It doesn't have to be vets though, people who experienced rape or witnessed the death

04:55.980 --> 04:57.620
of somebody can have the same reaction.

04:57.620 --> 05:00.780
The original purpose of the trigger warning was to let people know that what they were

05:00.780 --> 05:05.020
about to experience contained a common enough trigger, a loud bang or something, that a

05:05.020 --> 05:08.780
shell-shocked person or a victim of abuse might have a psychotic break if they were

05:08.780 --> 05:09.880
to experience it.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.300
The only problem is, trigger warnings don't actually work.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.820
The evidence is in on this.

05:13.820 --> 05:17.020
Trigger warnings don't actually cushion the blow of disturbing content, they actually

05:17.020 --> 05:21.700
teach people to expect it, allowing them to have their psychotic break earlier and harder.

05:21.700 --> 05:25.980
It conditions them, Pavlov's dog style, to have a worse episode than they otherwise would

05:25.980 --> 05:26.980
have had.

05:26.980 --> 05:30.140
We already know what helps with these types of conditions, and that's voluntarily confronting

05:30.140 --> 05:34.380
them repeatedly over a long period of time until you're so bored with the situation

05:34.380 --> 05:38.660
it can't possibly trigger you, not making them worse by dangling them in front of you.

05:38.660 --> 05:42.480
And the worst part is, there's actually evidence that trigger warnings themselves

05:42.480 --> 05:44.620
create a triggered response.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.940
Let's say you find something slightly unsettling.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.940
Here, here's a great example.

05:48.940 --> 05:49.940
Trigger warning, Nazism.

05:49.940 --> 05:54.820
Don't want to bust anyone's bubbles, but Heisenberg from Resident Evil 8 is a Nazi.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.740
He's got the Wehrmacht dog tags.

05:56.740 --> 05:58.220
Well, no shit.

05:58.220 --> 06:02.300
A villain in a video game who is a timeless being living in Eastern Europe might have

06:02.300 --> 06:04.020
had a past with the Nazis?

06:04.020 --> 06:05.220
You know he's a villain, right?

06:05.220 --> 06:09.220
I'm sorry that Marvel and Disney and Star Wars have conditioned you to believe that

06:09.220 --> 06:14.260
the hot guy who's kind of a dark, brooding oppositional figure to the hero is just masturbatory

06:14.260 --> 06:17.900
material, but yes, villains can actually be evil.

06:17.900 --> 06:22.420
The point is, though, if you're somebody who finds Nazism and Nazi imagery slightly

06:22.420 --> 06:27.760
unsettling, seeing trigger warning Nazism constantly anytime Nazis come up is actually

06:27.760 --> 06:32.060
more likely to make you more triggered at Nazis than if there were no trigger warnings

06:32.060 --> 06:33.060
at all.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.380
Most things create new trauma.

06:35.380 --> 06:40.180
It's been my experience that, for better or worse, people that survive messed up backgrounds

06:40.180 --> 06:45.100
oftentimes possess a decent depth of character that those from more privileged backgrounds

06:45.100 --> 06:46.100
don't have.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.220
Rather than working on making themselves more interesting or likeable or experienced, people

06:50.220 --> 06:55.060
will instead invent more and more fantastic backstories or qualities in order to add a

06:55.060 --> 06:56.460
fake depth to themselves.

06:56.460 --> 07:00.100
I think that's where a lot of the stupid twitter tags and bios come from.

07:00.100 --> 07:04.780
Where a lot of the imaginary or heavily trumped up or glorified mental illness shit comes

07:04.780 --> 07:05.780
from.

07:05.780 --> 07:10.260
Where the neo pronouns or the they them women who are 100% femme and have nothing masculine

07:10.260 --> 07:11.400
about them come from.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.700
All of that garbage.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.660
People want to be unique and different, and I'm not going to call them snowflakes, it

07:15.660 --> 07:19.620
actually is possible to be unique and different, but they don't want to put in the work to

07:19.620 --> 07:22.340
become that, so instead they just make stuff up.

07:22.340 --> 07:25.940
And so now you've got people segregating themselves into ever smaller and more minute

07:25.940 --> 07:30.380
sexualities and identities and whatever the fuck else in order to feel cool and unique

07:30.380 --> 07:34.260
and try to get even just a drop of meaning in their lives because they've got it so

07:34.260 --> 07:37.980
good in the modern era that they're not out there fighting for survival or doing any

07:37.980 --> 07:42.580
manual labor, they've become nothing more than mindless soulless consumers and calling

07:42.580 --> 07:48.180
themselves a he they sapiosexual with demi queer characteristics who believes in postmodern

07:48.180 --> 07:52.740
neo trotskyist thought or whatever the fuck provides just enough of a facsimile of a real

07:52.740 --> 07:56.260
fucking life that they can stave off the existential emptiness in their souls for one

07:56.260 --> 07:57.260
more day.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.800
But hey, you know what?

07:58.800 --> 08:01.820
There is at least one cool thing about these trigger warnings.

08:01.820 --> 08:05.540
Because of their current popularity, we're actually likely to see a return of those bomb-ass

08:05.540 --> 08:09.860
splash screens at the beginning of survival horror games that really helped set the mood.

08:09.860 --> 08:14.340
There are violent and disturbing images in this game, sign me the fuck up man.

08:14.340 --> 08:16.020
Alright that about does it for me for today.

08:16.020 --> 08:19.700
Yes, it's a shorter video to tide you over, I've got some more big ones planned soon,

08:19.700 --> 08:20.700
don't you worry.

08:20.700 --> 08:25.100
As always, I'm streaming this evening twitch.tv slash game boomers, make sure you're there.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.700
Alright guys, I'll see you tonight.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.260
Have a good day, I love you.
