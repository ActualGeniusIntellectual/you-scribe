0	3380	Hey guys, Dev here, and happy Canadian Thanksgiving.
3380	7840	This is an update vlog just to tell you guys what's going to be going on for October on
7840	8880	our channel.
8880	12840	First of all, it's October 12th, and we had initially planned to do a Canadian Thanksgiving
12840	13840	special.
13840	18120	It was going to be the first session of No Talent Gaming without Dave.
18120	23120	It would be me and Jess, and we would be playing Harvest Moon.
23120	27340	But it turns out that Jess just couldn't make it, she got a new job, and the schedules just
27340	28340	didn't line up.
28340	33180	So instead, today, we're going to be starting our No Talent Gaming Halloween stuff.
33180	38940	We initially planned to start it on the 13th, tomorrow, but because we couldn't do the Thanksgiving
38940	41340	stuff, we're just going to push it ahead a day.
41340	48100	So our plan for Thanksgiving was initially to do two Harvest Moons with me and Jess.
48100	52820	Today, two more on American Thanksgiving, and then I don't know if we're going to be
52820	56540	working Easter or something later if we needed more, because they're going to be very long
56540	57540	episodes.
57740	61820	But because that's no longer feasible, we're just going to start Halloween now, and then
61820	65540	on the American Thanksgiving, we're going to have four Harvest Moons, just to make sure
65540	66820	we don't fall behind.
66820	70940	As for Halloween itself, it's running from today until the 31st, obviously, and there's
70940	73220	going to be a whole bunch of really fun games.
73220	76580	I'm not going to tell you all of them just yet, but I will mention one.
76580	82260	Dave and I are going to be playing Eternal Darkness, Sanity's Requiem for the GameCube.
82420	88380	And then after Halloween's over, we're going to do a short series from the 31st to the
88380	91300	2nd of Guacamelee!
91300	96460	And the main reason we're doing that is because of the whole Mexico Day of the Dead celebration,
96460	99540	and Dave really wanted to just have an excuse to play Guacamelee!
99540	105620	And also, at the same time, running concurrently, we're going to have a session of Super Mario Maker.
105620	109540	If you want us to play any of your levels, just put them in the comments or tweet them
109540	113420	at us or whatever, because we are going to collect a bunch of fan levels and play them.
113420	119980	We're going to grab some levels probably from, I know Game Face Max did a bunch of levels.
119980	123580	Maybe if anyone over at BLG has done some levels, I'm probably going to find out and
123580	124580	get their levels.
124580	131420	And I'm going to try and build a level worthy of Dave's Rage, so that's going to be a lot
131420	132420	of fun.
132420	136820	And then after Guacamelee! and Mario Maker, we're going to basically continue with our
136820	139420	usual long hauls.
139420	142380	Long Soul Silver is nearly done, so we're going to wrap that up.
142380	146060	Link's Awakening is nearly done, so we're going to wrap that up.
146060	151700	We're going to start Metal Gear Solid 2 and Sonic Adventure.
151700	156520	Wild Arms is still ongoing, and there's going to be a few more surprises as well.
156520	162420	From now on, for No Talent Gaming, we're going to be trying out 20 minute episodes.
162420	167680	Some people, I think most vocally Dynasty Star, have been saying that 10 minute episodes
167680	169440	are kind of short.
169440	173140	And we agreed with them that it was short, but it made editing easier, it made putting
173140	174520	things out easier.
174520	180440	But now that all three of us are editing, 20 minutes shouldn't be a problem, so we're
180440	181680	going to give it a go.
181680	187000	With the Halloween stuff, Eternal Darkness is going to be 20 minutes, some of the other
187000	193240	games are going to be 15-20 minutes, and if the editing load isn't too heavy, we're going
193240	197920	to maintain 20 minute episodes after Halloween is over.
197920	203720	So the current plan, if everything goes well, is you get two 20 minute episodes of NTG a
203720	204720	day.
204720	207440	And this should honestly help us get through some games a little bit quicker.
207440	211680	I know Pokemon Soul Silver is going to take a year and a half to finally beat once we're
211680	214280	done with it.
214280	218040	Link's Awakening is going to be almost 50 parts.
218040	221760	These are just some really long let's plays for games that aren't really that long.
221760	225320	We're hoping to cut things down, we're hoping to get through games faster so we can get
225320	230960	to more games and not have things drag on for upwards of a year.
230960	234040	And we think that 20 minute episodes, now that we're capable of doing it, is the way
234040	235040	to go.
235040	240760	Additionally, we do have a few ideas for some anime reviews, finally.
240760	244780	The current plan, though I don't know if it'll actually stay this way, is that we're going
244780	251400	to have two in October on the 20th and 30th, both of them Halloween related of course.
251440	256360	And they are going to be Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate.
256360	262480	Additionally, I want to set up the SFO stream, yeah, on Twitch.tv.
262480	267680	I'm going to try to be doing that either this week or maybe next week, but basically we
267680	271400	wanted to stream for a while now, we just really haven't had the time to really look
271400	276840	into it and to see what you need to do, but it doesn't seem like there's really that much.
276840	282600	I'm going to try streaming probably some Binding of Isaac because, well, one, it is
282600	285600	Halloween-ish, and two, because I've never really played that game before.
285600	290480	I heard it's really good, I like procedurally generated kind of like random dungeon games
290480	295440	like Rogue Legacy and stuff like that, and Binding of Isaac is basically just that game.
295440	301200	We did actually record a session of Binding of Isaac like two years ago, way before, you
301200	305920	know, Cam and I moved into this house when it was just Al and Dave.
305920	310120	We did some Binding of Isaac, but we lost the footage, it was completely unusable, and
310120	313400	we sort of sat on the game since then.
313400	317280	I might do some Hearthstone as well, because since we did our Hearthstone series, I've
317280	318880	been playing a lot of it.
318880	324280	I wasn't involved in that series, but basically watching Dave and Jess play it kind of got
324280	325280	me into the game.
325280	328280	So we might stream some of that, I don't know, we might stream some other games, we'll figure
328280	329280	it out.
329280	333760	And these are just going to be kind of casual streams, you know, you can pop in, you can
333760	336880	talk about the game if you want, you can talk about other stuff, like you can talk
336880	341400	about, I don't know, you can talk about Gamergate if you like, since I know a lot of people
341400	342400	like to talk to us about Gamergate.
342400	346000	You can come on in and just chat with us about that, you know, whatever you want.
346000	349780	It's all just kind of let's hang out and play some games type of streams.
349780	354600	As for Gamergate, you know, I think we've all kind of realized at this point that Indefensible
354600	361640	as an ongoing series is not really viable because you can't have major blowouts every
361640	363120	week, you know?
363120	366840	You can't like, you can't uncover some new huge scandal constantly.
366840	372000	Eventually you're just going to run out of clues, you're going to run out of tips, you're
372000	376080	going to run out of people leaking stuff and kind of things sort of settle down.
376080	380080	That doesn't mean that Gamergate is over, I don't think it is, I think it will be around
380080	383520	for a long time if not under the same name.
383520	389800	But I don't think there's really going to be any more in terms of like discovering stuff.
389800	394720	We might have some stuff coming up in the future, but it's not going to be the way it
394720	395720	was a year ago.
395720	402920	So as sort of a replacement for that, we're going to have a new series called SF Opinions,
402920	406920	which by the way, I forget who it was, but a commenter commented that, that's what the
406920	413480	series should be called, SF Opinions, just as a series where I kind of just sit down
413480	418800	and chat with you about, you know, whatever topic of the day is on my mind.
418800	422120	There's going to be no Cam involved in this, there's going to be no Dave, it's just going
422120	423400	to be me.
423400	427440	I'm going to write it, I'm going to record it, I'm going to edit it, I'm going to put
427440	428440	it out.
428440	431000	That's going to be basically my baby on the channel.
431000	435760	And even though it is kind of going to be like, Gamergate related and Corruption related
435760	441040	and SJW related, it's not always going to be within those confines.
441040	444200	It's basically just going to be whatever I feel like talking about.
444200	447940	I've already kind of gotten some work done on a few scripts for them.
447980	453980	Just as an example, one of them is on Pedophilia, with the whole Sarah Butts thing happening,
453980	456060	you know, recently.
456060	460520	And one of them is on the state of World of Warcraft with the upcoming Legion expansion.
460520	464980	So this series really is going to, you know, run the gamut of topics.
464980	469500	As for when you can expect it, I'm hoping to do at least one to two a week.
469500	473420	I want to get the first one out later this week sometime.
473420	478300	As for Indefensibles themselves, we might have something in October, because there are
478300	483380	some leads that I know Cam's looking into, but because of the nature of Gamergate at
483380	488540	this point, it's not going to be a guaranteed thing if and when those videos come out.
488540	495260	However, the plan for SF Opinions is one to two a week on these related topics of the
495260	501760	day, and I hope that you guys will really enjoy them as sort of a replacement to our
501760	504080	Gamergate exclusive investigative stuff.
504080	509240	And I guess the final thing to mention, for all of you who have been supporting the channel
509240	514800	financially, whether that's through, you know, letting the ads run on the YouTube videos,
514800	520600	or PayPal, or giving through Patreon, or whatever.
520600	523040	First of all, thank you, obviously.
523040	527580	Secondly, we've bought all of the minor equipment that we need.
527580	531080	We have, you know, the sound equipment, we have some of the lighting stuff, we have some
531080	536060	of the games, some of the anime to do videos on, we have the soundboard, you saw me unbox
536060	539320	the soundboard.
539320	542640	Really at this point, there's only large purchases left.
542640	547120	So for those of you who are giving, and are wondering where your money is going, that's
547120	548120	where it's going.
548120	552280	We're not spending it, we're not living on it, we all still have our day jobs, but we're
552280	553980	just socking it away.
553980	556880	So if you're wondering, like, why am I still supporting these guys?
556880	558300	What's the point of this?
558300	559300	That's the point.
559300	565540	We have some very, we have some very big ambitions for this channel, we have some very big ideas,
565540	568460	and that's going to require some equipment that we just don't have right now.
568460	570700	So that's basically where we're sitting right now.
570700	574300	If you're Canadian, enjoy your Thanksgiving, if you're American, enjoy your Thanksgiving
574300	579340	a little bit later, you'll see some Harvest Moon for it, hopefully.
579340	583620	Stay tuned to a lot of stuff going on this October, whether you're into the No Talent
583620	587660	Gaming stuff with all of our October specials, whether you're into the anime reviews with
587660	591020	some upcoming Hellsing, whether you're here for Gamergate stuff, we have some of that
591020	592660	coming on the horizon as well.
592660	596600	There's something here for pretty much everybody right now, so I hope you guys stick around
596600	597260	and check it out.
