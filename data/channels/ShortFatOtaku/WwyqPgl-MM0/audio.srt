00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
Hey guys, Dev here, and happy Canadian Thanksgiving.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,840
This is an update vlog just to tell you guys what's going to be going on for October on

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,880
our channel.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,840
First of all, it's October 12th, and we had initially planned to do a Canadian Thanksgiving

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
special.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,120
It was going to be the first session of No Talent Gaming without Dave.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,120
It would be me and Jess, and we would be playing Harvest Moon.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,340
But it turns out that Jess just couldn't make it, she got a new job, and the schedules just

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,340
didn't line up.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,180
So instead, today, we're going to be starting our No Talent Gaming Halloween stuff.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,940
We initially planned to start it on the 13th, tomorrow, but because we couldn't do the Thanksgiving

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,340
stuff, we're just going to push it ahead a day.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,100
So our plan for Thanksgiving was initially to do two Harvest Moons with me and Jess.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,820
Today, two more on American Thanksgiving, and then I don't know if we're going to be

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,540
working Easter or something later if we needed more, because they're going to be very long

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,540
episodes.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,820
But because that's no longer feasible, we're just going to start Halloween now, and then

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,540
on the American Thanksgiving, we're going to have four Harvest Moons, just to make sure

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,820
we don't fall behind.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,940
As for Halloween itself, it's running from today until the 31st, obviously, and there's

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,220
going to be a whole bunch of really fun games.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,580
I'm not going to tell you all of them just yet, but I will mention one.

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,260
Dave and I are going to be playing Eternal Darkness, Sanity's Requiem for the GameCube.

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,380
And then after Halloween's over, we're going to do a short series from the 31st to the

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,300
2nd of Guacamelee!

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,460
And the main reason we're doing that is because of the whole Mexico Day of the Dead celebration,

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,540
and Dave really wanted to just have an excuse to play Guacamelee!

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,620
And also, at the same time, running concurrently, we're going to have a session of Super Mario Maker.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,540
If you want us to play any of your levels, just put them in the comments or tweet them

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,420
at us or whatever, because we are going to collect a bunch of fan levels and play them.

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,980
We're going to grab some levels probably from, I know Game Face Max did a bunch of levels.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,580
Maybe if anyone over at BLG has done some levels, I'm probably going to find out and

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,580
get their levels.

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:11,420
And I'm going to try and build a level worthy of Dave's Rage, so that's going to be a lot

35
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
of fun.

36
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,820
And then after Guacamelee! and Mario Maker, we're going to basically continue with our

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,420
usual long hauls.

38
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,380
Long Soul Silver is nearly done, so we're going to wrap that up.

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,060
Link's Awakening is nearly done, so we're going to wrap that up.

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,700
We're going to start Metal Gear Solid 2 and Sonic Adventure.

41
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,520
Wild Arms is still ongoing, and there's going to be a few more surprises as well.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,420
From now on, for No Talent Gaming, we're going to be trying out 20 minute episodes.

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,680
Some people, I think most vocally Dynasty Star, have been saying that 10 minute episodes

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,440
are kind of short.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,140
And we agreed with them that it was short, but it made editing easier, it made putting

46
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,520
things out easier.

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,440
But now that all three of us are editing, 20 minutes shouldn't be a problem, so we're

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
going to give it a go.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,000
With the Halloween stuff, Eternal Darkness is going to be 20 minutes, some of the other

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,240
games are going to be 15-20 minutes, and if the editing load isn't too heavy, we're going

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,920
to maintain 20 minute episodes after Halloween is over.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,720
So the current plan, if everything goes well, is you get two 20 minute episodes of NTG a

53
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
day.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,440
And this should honestly help us get through some games a little bit quicker.

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,680
I know Pokemon Soul Silver is going to take a year and a half to finally beat once we're

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,280
done with it.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,040
Link's Awakening is going to be almost 50 parts.

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,760
These are just some really long let's plays for games that aren't really that long.

59
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,320
We're hoping to cut things down, we're hoping to get through games faster so we can get

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,960
to more games and not have things drag on for upwards of a year.

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,040
And we think that 20 minute episodes, now that we're capable of doing it, is the way

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
to go.

63
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,760
Additionally, we do have a few ideas for some anime reviews, finally.

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,780
The current plan, though I don't know if it'll actually stay this way, is that we're going

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,400
to have two in October on the 20th and 30th, both of them Halloween related of course.

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,360
And they are going to be Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate.

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,480
Additionally, I want to set up the SFO stream, yeah, on Twitch.tv.

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm going to try to be doing that either this week or maybe next week, but basically we

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,400
wanted to stream for a while now, we just really haven't had the time to really look

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,840
into it and to see what you need to do, but it doesn't seem like there's really that much.

71
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm going to try streaming probably some Binding of Isaac because, well, one, it is

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Halloween-ish, and two, because I've never really played that game before.

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,480
I heard it's really good, I like procedurally generated kind of like random dungeon games

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,440
like Rogue Legacy and stuff like that, and Binding of Isaac is basically just that game.

75
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,200
We did actually record a session of Binding of Isaac like two years ago, way before, you

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,920
know, Cam and I moved into this house when it was just Al and Dave.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,120
We did some Binding of Isaac, but we lost the footage, it was completely unusable, and

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,400
we sort of sat on the game since then.

79
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,280
I might do some Hearthstone as well, because since we did our Hearthstone series, I've

80
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
been playing a lot of it.

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,280
I wasn't involved in that series, but basically watching Dave and Jess play it kind of got

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
me into the game.

83
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,280
So we might stream some of that, I don't know, we might stream some other games, we'll figure

84
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
it out.

85
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,760
And these are just going to be kind of casual streams, you know, you can pop in, you can

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,880
talk about the game if you want, you can talk about other stuff, like you can talk

87
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,400
about, I don't know, you can talk about Gamergate if you like, since I know a lot of people

88
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
like to talk to us about Gamergate.

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
You can come on in and just chat with us about that, you know, whatever you want.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,780
It's all just kind of let's hang out and play some games type of streams.

91
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,600
As for Gamergate, you know, I think we've all kind of realized at this point that Indefensible

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,640
as an ongoing series is not really viable because you can't have major blowouts every

93
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,120
week, you know?

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,840
You can't like, you can't uncover some new huge scandal constantly.

95
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,000
Eventually you're just going to run out of clues, you're going to run out of tips, you're

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
going to run out of people leaking stuff and kind of things sort of settle down.

97
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,080
That doesn't mean that Gamergate is over, I don't think it is, I think it will be around

98
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
for a long time if not under the same name.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,800
But I don't think there's really going to be any more in terms of like discovering stuff.

100
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,720
We might have some stuff coming up in the future, but it's not going to be the way it

101
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
was a year ago.

102
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,920
So as sort of a replacement for that, we're going to have a new series called SF Opinions,

103
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,920
which by the way, I forget who it was, but a commenter commented that, that's what the

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:53,480
series should be called, SF Opinions, just as a series where I kind of just sit down

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,800
and chat with you about, you know, whatever topic of the day is on my mind.

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,120
There's going to be no Cam involved in this, there's going to be no Dave, it's just going

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,400
to be me.

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm going to write it, I'm going to record it, I'm going to edit it, I'm going to put

109
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
it out.

110
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,000
That's going to be basically my baby on the channel.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,760
And even though it is kind of going to be like, Gamergate related and Corruption related

112
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,040
and SJW related, it's not always going to be within those confines.

113
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,200
It's basically just going to be whatever I feel like talking about.

114
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,940
I've already kind of gotten some work done on a few scripts for them.

115
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Just as an example, one of them is on Pedophilia, with the whole Sarah Butts thing happening,

116
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,060
you know, recently.

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,520
And one of them is on the state of World of Warcraft with the upcoming Legion expansion.

118
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,980
So this series really is going to, you know, run the gamut of topics.

119
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,500
As for when you can expect it, I'm hoping to do at least one to two a week.

120
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,420
I want to get the first one out later this week sometime.

121
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,300
As for Indefensibles themselves, we might have something in October, because there are

122
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,380
some leads that I know Cam's looking into, but because of the nature of Gamergate at

123
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,540
this point, it's not going to be a guaranteed thing if and when those videos come out.

124
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:15,260
However, the plan for SF Opinions is one to two a week on these related topics of the

125
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:21,760
day, and I hope that you guys will really enjoy them as sort of a replacement to our

126
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,080
Gamergate exclusive investigative stuff.

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,240
And I guess the final thing to mention, for all of you who have been supporting the channel

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,800
financially, whether that's through, you know, letting the ads run on the YouTube videos,

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,600
or PayPal, or giving through Patreon, or whatever.

130
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,040
First of all, thank you, obviously.

131
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,580
Secondly, we've bought all of the minor equipment that we need.

132
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,080
We have, you know, the sound equipment, we have some of the lighting stuff, we have some

133
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,060
of the games, some of the anime to do videos on, we have the soundboard, you saw me unbox

134
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,320
the soundboard.

135
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,640
Really at this point, there's only large purchases left.

136
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,120
So for those of you who are giving, and are wondering where your money is going, that's

137
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
where it's going.

138
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,280
We're not spending it, we're not living on it, we all still have our day jobs, but we're

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,980
just socking it away.

140
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,880
So if you're wondering, like, why am I still supporting these guys?

141
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,300
What's the point of this?

142
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
That's the point.

143
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,540
We have some very, we have some very big ambitions for this channel, we have some very big ideas,

144
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,460
and that's going to require some equipment that we just don't have right now.

145
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,700
So that's basically where we're sitting right now.

146
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,300
If you're Canadian, enjoy your Thanksgiving, if you're American, enjoy your Thanksgiving

147
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,340
a little bit later, you'll see some Harvest Moon for it, hopefully.

148
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,620
Stay tuned to a lot of stuff going on this October, whether you're into the No Talent

149
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,660
Gaming stuff with all of our October specials, whether you're into the anime reviews with

150
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,020
some upcoming Hellsing, whether you're here for Gamergate stuff, we have some of that

151
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,660
coming on the horizon as well.

152
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,600
There's something here for pretty much everybody right now, so I hope you guys stick around

153
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,260
and check it out.
