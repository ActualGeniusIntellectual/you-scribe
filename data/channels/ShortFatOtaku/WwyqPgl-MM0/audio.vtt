WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.380
Hey guys, Dev here, and happy Canadian Thanksgiving.

00:03.380 --> 00:07.840
This is an update vlog just to tell you guys what's going to be going on for October on

00:07.840 --> 00:08.880
our channel.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.840
First of all, it's October 12th, and we had initially planned to do a Canadian Thanksgiving

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
special.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.120
It was going to be the first session of No Talent Gaming without Dave.

00:18.120 --> 00:23.120
It would be me and Jess, and we would be playing Harvest Moon.

00:23.120 --> 00:27.340
But it turns out that Jess just couldn't make it, she got a new job, and the schedules just

00:27.340 --> 00:28.340
didn't line up.

00:28.340 --> 00:33.180
So instead, today, we're going to be starting our No Talent Gaming Halloween stuff.

00:33.180 --> 00:38.940
We initially planned to start it on the 13th, tomorrow, but because we couldn't do the Thanksgiving

00:38.940 --> 00:41.340
stuff, we're just going to push it ahead a day.

00:41.340 --> 00:48.100
So our plan for Thanksgiving was initially to do two Harvest Moons with me and Jess.

00:48.100 --> 00:52.820
Today, two more on American Thanksgiving, and then I don't know if we're going to be

00:52.820 --> 00:56.540
working Easter or something later if we needed more, because they're going to be very long

00:56.540 --> 00:57.540
episodes.

00:57.740 --> 01:01.820
But because that's no longer feasible, we're just going to start Halloween now, and then

01:01.820 --> 01:05.540
on the American Thanksgiving, we're going to have four Harvest Moons, just to make sure

01:05.540 --> 01:06.820
we don't fall behind.

01:06.820 --> 01:10.940
As for Halloween itself, it's running from today until the 31st, obviously, and there's

01:10.940 --> 01:13.220
going to be a whole bunch of really fun games.

01:13.220 --> 01:16.580
I'm not going to tell you all of them just yet, but I will mention one.

01:16.580 --> 01:22.260
Dave and I are going to be playing Eternal Darkness, Sanity's Requiem for the GameCube.

01:22.420 --> 01:28.380
And then after Halloween's over, we're going to do a short series from the 31st to the

01:28.380 --> 01:31.300
2nd of Guacamelee!

01:31.300 --> 01:36.460
And the main reason we're doing that is because of the whole Mexico Day of the Dead celebration,

01:36.460 --> 01:39.540
and Dave really wanted to just have an excuse to play Guacamelee!

01:39.540 --> 01:45.620
And also, at the same time, running concurrently, we're going to have a session of Super Mario Maker.

01:45.620 --> 01:49.540
If you want us to play any of your levels, just put them in the comments or tweet them

01:49.540 --> 01:53.420
at us or whatever, because we are going to collect a bunch of fan levels and play them.

01:53.420 --> 01:59.980
We're going to grab some levels probably from, I know Game Face Max did a bunch of levels.

01:59.980 --> 02:03.580
Maybe if anyone over at BLG has done some levels, I'm probably going to find out and

02:03.580 --> 02:04.580
get their levels.

02:04.580 --> 02:11.420
And I'm going to try and build a level worthy of Dave's Rage, so that's going to be a lot

02:11.420 --> 02:12.420
of fun.

02:12.420 --> 02:16.820
And then after Guacamelee! and Mario Maker, we're going to basically continue with our

02:16.820 --> 02:19.420
usual long hauls.

02:19.420 --> 02:22.380
Long Soul Silver is nearly done, so we're going to wrap that up.

02:22.380 --> 02:26.060
Link's Awakening is nearly done, so we're going to wrap that up.

02:26.060 --> 02:31.700
We're going to start Metal Gear Solid 2 and Sonic Adventure.

02:31.700 --> 02:36.520
Wild Arms is still ongoing, and there's going to be a few more surprises as well.

02:36.520 --> 02:42.420
From now on, for No Talent Gaming, we're going to be trying out 20 minute episodes.

02:42.420 --> 02:47.680
Some people, I think most vocally Dynasty Star, have been saying that 10 minute episodes

02:47.680 --> 02:49.440
are kind of short.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.140
And we agreed with them that it was short, but it made editing easier, it made putting

02:53.140 --> 02:54.520
things out easier.

02:54.520 --> 03:00.440
But now that all three of us are editing, 20 minutes shouldn't be a problem, so we're

03:00.440 --> 03:01.680
going to give it a go.

03:01.680 --> 03:07.000
With the Halloween stuff, Eternal Darkness is going to be 20 minutes, some of the other

03:07.000 --> 03:13.240
games are going to be 15-20 minutes, and if the editing load isn't too heavy, we're going

03:13.240 --> 03:17.920
to maintain 20 minute episodes after Halloween is over.

03:17.920 --> 03:23.720
So the current plan, if everything goes well, is you get two 20 minute episodes of NTG a

03:23.720 --> 03:24.720
day.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.440
And this should honestly help us get through some games a little bit quicker.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.680
I know Pokemon Soul Silver is going to take a year and a half to finally beat once we're

03:31.680 --> 03:34.280
done with it.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.040
Link's Awakening is going to be almost 50 parts.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.760
These are just some really long let's plays for games that aren't really that long.

03:41.760 --> 03:45.320
We're hoping to cut things down, we're hoping to get through games faster so we can get

03:45.320 --> 03:50.960
to more games and not have things drag on for upwards of a year.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.040
And we think that 20 minute episodes, now that we're capable of doing it, is the way

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
to go.

03:55.040 --> 04:00.760
Additionally, we do have a few ideas for some anime reviews, finally.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.780
The current plan, though I don't know if it'll actually stay this way, is that we're going

04:04.780 --> 04:11.400
to have two in October on the 20th and 30th, both of them Halloween related of course.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.360
And they are going to be Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate.

04:16.360 --> 04:22.480
Additionally, I want to set up the SFO stream, yeah, on Twitch.tv.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.680
I'm going to try to be doing that either this week or maybe next week, but basically we

04:27.680 --> 04:31.400
wanted to stream for a while now, we just really haven't had the time to really look

04:31.400 --> 04:36.840
into it and to see what you need to do, but it doesn't seem like there's really that much.

04:36.840 --> 04:42.600
I'm going to try streaming probably some Binding of Isaac because, well, one, it is

04:42.600 --> 04:45.600
Halloween-ish, and two, because I've never really played that game before.

04:45.600 --> 04:50.480
I heard it's really good, I like procedurally generated kind of like random dungeon games

04:50.480 --> 04:55.440
like Rogue Legacy and stuff like that, and Binding of Isaac is basically just that game.

04:55.440 --> 05:01.200
We did actually record a session of Binding of Isaac like two years ago, way before, you

05:01.200 --> 05:05.920
know, Cam and I moved into this house when it was just Al and Dave.

05:05.920 --> 05:10.120
We did some Binding of Isaac, but we lost the footage, it was completely unusable, and

05:10.120 --> 05:13.400
we sort of sat on the game since then.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.280
I might do some Hearthstone as well, because since we did our Hearthstone series, I've

05:17.280 --> 05:18.880
been playing a lot of it.

05:18.880 --> 05:24.280
I wasn't involved in that series, but basically watching Dave and Jess play it kind of got

05:24.280 --> 05:25.280
me into the game.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.280
So we might stream some of that, I don't know, we might stream some other games, we'll figure

05:28.280 --> 05:29.280
it out.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.760
And these are just going to be kind of casual streams, you know, you can pop in, you can

05:33.760 --> 05:36.880
talk about the game if you want, you can talk about other stuff, like you can talk

05:36.880 --> 05:41.400
about, I don't know, you can talk about Gamergate if you like, since I know a lot of people

05:41.400 --> 05:42.400
like to talk to us about Gamergate.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.000
You can come on in and just chat with us about that, you know, whatever you want.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.780
It's all just kind of let's hang out and play some games type of streams.

05:49.780 --> 05:54.600
As for Gamergate, you know, I think we've all kind of realized at this point that Indefensible

05:54.600 --> 06:01.640
as an ongoing series is not really viable because you can't have major blowouts every

06:01.640 --> 06:03.120
week, you know?

06:03.120 --> 06:06.840
You can't like, you can't uncover some new huge scandal constantly.

06:06.840 --> 06:12.000
Eventually you're just going to run out of clues, you're going to run out of tips, you're

06:12.000 --> 06:16.080
going to run out of people leaking stuff and kind of things sort of settle down.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.080
That doesn't mean that Gamergate is over, I don't think it is, I think it will be around

06:20.080 --> 06:23.520
for a long time if not under the same name.

06:23.520 --> 06:29.800
But I don't think there's really going to be any more in terms of like discovering stuff.

06:29.800 --> 06:34.720
We might have some stuff coming up in the future, but it's not going to be the way it

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
was a year ago.

06:35.720 --> 06:42.920
So as sort of a replacement for that, we're going to have a new series called SF Opinions,

06:42.920 --> 06:46.920
which by the way, I forget who it was, but a commenter commented that, that's what the

06:46.920 --> 06:53.480
series should be called, SF Opinions, just as a series where I kind of just sit down

06:53.480 --> 06:58.800
and chat with you about, you know, whatever topic of the day is on my mind.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.120
There's going to be no Cam involved in this, there's going to be no Dave, it's just going

07:02.120 --> 07:03.400
to be me.

07:03.400 --> 07:07.440
I'm going to write it, I'm going to record it, I'm going to edit it, I'm going to put

07:07.440 --> 07:08.440
it out.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.000
That's going to be basically my baby on the channel.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.760
And even though it is kind of going to be like, Gamergate related and Corruption related

07:15.760 --> 07:21.040
and SJW related, it's not always going to be within those confines.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.200
It's basically just going to be whatever I feel like talking about.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.940
I've already kind of gotten some work done on a few scripts for them.

07:27.980 --> 07:33.980
Just as an example, one of them is on Pedophilia, with the whole Sarah Butts thing happening,

07:33.980 --> 07:36.060
you know, recently.

07:36.060 --> 07:40.520
And one of them is on the state of World of Warcraft with the upcoming Legion expansion.

07:40.520 --> 07:44.980
So this series really is going to, you know, run the gamut of topics.

07:44.980 --> 07:49.500
As for when you can expect it, I'm hoping to do at least one to two a week.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.420
I want to get the first one out later this week sometime.

07:53.420 --> 07:58.300
As for Indefensibles themselves, we might have something in October, because there are

07:58.300 --> 08:03.380
some leads that I know Cam's looking into, but because of the nature of Gamergate at

08:03.380 --> 08:08.540
this point, it's not going to be a guaranteed thing if and when those videos come out.

08:08.540 --> 08:15.260
However, the plan for SF Opinions is one to two a week on these related topics of the

08:15.260 --> 08:21.760
day, and I hope that you guys will really enjoy them as sort of a replacement to our

08:21.760 --> 08:24.080
Gamergate exclusive investigative stuff.

08:24.080 --> 08:29.240
And I guess the final thing to mention, for all of you who have been supporting the channel

08:29.240 --> 08:34.800
financially, whether that's through, you know, letting the ads run on the YouTube videos,

08:34.800 --> 08:40.600
or PayPal, or giving through Patreon, or whatever.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.040
First of all, thank you, obviously.

08:43.040 --> 08:47.580
Secondly, we've bought all of the minor equipment that we need.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.080
We have, you know, the sound equipment, we have some of the lighting stuff, we have some

08:51.080 --> 08:56.060
of the games, some of the anime to do videos on, we have the soundboard, you saw me unbox

08:56.060 --> 08:59.320
the soundboard.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.640
Really at this point, there's only large purchases left.

09:02.640 --> 09:07.120
So for those of you who are giving, and are wondering where your money is going, that's

09:07.120 --> 09:08.120
where it's going.

09:08.120 --> 09:12.280
We're not spending it, we're not living on it, we all still have our day jobs, but we're

09:12.280 --> 09:13.980
just socking it away.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.880
So if you're wondering, like, why am I still supporting these guys?

09:16.880 --> 09:18.300
What's the point of this?

09:18.300 --> 09:19.300
That's the point.

09:19.300 --> 09:25.540
We have some very, we have some very big ambitions for this channel, we have some very big ideas,

09:25.540 --> 09:28.460
and that's going to require some equipment that we just don't have right now.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.700
So that's basically where we're sitting right now.

09:30.700 --> 09:34.300
If you're Canadian, enjoy your Thanksgiving, if you're American, enjoy your Thanksgiving

09:34.300 --> 09:39.340
a little bit later, you'll see some Harvest Moon for it, hopefully.

09:39.340 --> 09:43.620
Stay tuned to a lot of stuff going on this October, whether you're into the No Talent

09:43.620 --> 09:47.660
Gaming stuff with all of our October specials, whether you're into the anime reviews with

09:47.660 --> 09:51.020
some upcoming Hellsing, whether you're here for Gamergate stuff, we have some of that

09:51.020 --> 09:52.660
coming on the horizon as well.

09:52.660 --> 09:56.600
There's something here for pretty much everybody right now, so I hope you guys stick around

09:56.600 --> 09:57.260
and check it out.
