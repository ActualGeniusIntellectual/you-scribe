0	3520	Alright my friends, this is the video that a lot of you have been waiting for.
3520	7600	I've been regularly receiving comments about this video topic for some time now,
7600	12160	so I guess I should get into it. Let's talk about corruption culture.
13280	17280	Yeah, that's the video you wanted, right? I don't know how popular the term
17280	21520	corruption culture is. It's certainly not nearly as popular as the term
21520	25760	cancel culture, that's for sure. But corruption culture is still definitely a thing.
25760	31040	Corruption culture refers to the tendency of people on the left to infiltrate certain spaces
31040	36640	that were, if not apolitical, certainly not left-leaning, and gradually over time
36640	42160	tilt them towards radical leftist politics. And we've seen this happen for, like, a decade now.
42160	46720	Rational Wiki didn't start out as this bastion of feminist thought, it actually once was
46720	50880	rational. You head over to the Rational Wiki nowadays and it's basically viewing all the
50880	55120	topics through an intersectionalist lens, not a rationalist one. It happened with the whole
55120	60400	atheism plus thing, which for a long time was all, like, Richard Dawkins types, making fun of
60400	64560	the religious right on the early internet. Well, that got co-opted into atheism plus,
64560	69840	where it wasn't true atheism unless it had a social justice slant. The online atheist sphere
69840	74400	was meant to combat intolerance stemming out of religion, and while there's definitely some
74400	79760	crossover between that and feminism and anti-racism and etc etc, there's also a lot where it's
79760	84480	actively opposed, like when you bring Islam into the mix. And gamergate was a corruption culture
84480	89520	issue too, ultimately. The old SJWs rampaged around the internet like eight-ish years ago,
89520	93680	forcing their way into any community they could get into and shitting it up. And it was those
93680	99520	pesky gamers that told them finally to fuck off, earning them that only partially deserved
99520	104160	incel reputation in the process. When I'm just kinda talking about internet bullshit so far,
104160	107760	there is a real aspect to corruption culture that I think we can discuss.
107760	112480	When I made my video on Gearbox Software, in the part talking about Borderlands 3,
112480	117920	I brought up this series of tweets. From Siran Strange, and this is not some nobody,
117920	122880	this is somebody who actually worked on Borderlands 3. Flak uses they-them pronouns.
123920	130320	Print six, I guess. Stop pushing your own ignorance and anxiety on LGBTQ game devs and gamers.
130320	135920	Smooch. Ah. I imagine it's legit difficult playing what could be your first game without
135920	141520	two-plus options for strictly male characters. That can be legit scary. But you aren't being
141520	146320	erased. I swear, heart, everyone has a place in this world. We just want to give options to those
146320	151360	who've never had them. And if, after that, you still find yourself spitting mad, fuck you,
151360	156400	it's 100% canon. Retweeting this again, this one goes out to all the haters out there.
156400	159840	I hope you find what you need in your own life to be fulfilled enough that you no longer feel
159840	164960	the urge to be a wank-not. This is in reference to a robot character named Flak, and how they use
164960	169200	they-them pronouns, presumably because they're a robot and therefore they wouldn't need a gender.
169200	174080	I guess that makes sense. I don't really care too much because Borderlands 3 was absolute fucking
174080	179040	garbage. But the point is, read this condescension, guys. Like, I've played a lot of games where there
179040	184000	was no option to play as male characters. I'm fine with it. I think most people are honestly fine
184000	189680	with it. This whole thing, you aren't being erased, I swear. Like, they talk a lot about
189680	196160	trans erasure, or, you know, about LGBT erasure, whatever. Erasure is the method in which, in
196160	201280	narratives and storytelling, you basically get rid of things that are kind of outside the norm.
201280	206480	This was known for a while as burying your gays, meaning that in TV shows and movies,
206480	211920	especially in the 90s, even though there was gay representation, the gay characters often
211920	216720	always died very early into the narrative, or they left the show, or something like that.
216720	221440	But the reason this person words it like this, like, you know, you aren't being erased, I swear,
222000	227040	there's a reason for that. It's because they know that they've wormed their way into a position of
227040	230480	power, and they're going to inject their own politics wherever they can now that they're
230480	234960	there. You can see both the olive branch and the knife, you know, in the two separate tweets.
235520	239920	It's like, come on board with the LGBT agenda. Oh, you don't want to? Fuck you.
240480	244480	And as you scroll through the actual replies, you see something like this here.
244480	248720	I'm getting so tired of people blatantly using the wrong pronouns for flack. Legit saw someone
248800	252400	say the pronouns don't matter. It does not impact the character as if gender identity isn't a highly
252400	256480	important part of who someone is. It's a fucking robot. In this case, in this specific case,
256480	259840	where it's a robot and not a human. Yeah, that gender identity doesn't really matter. Like,
259840	264240	who fucking cares, right? And there is some discussion on both sides of the aisle happening
264240	268720	here. But this really isn't about the discussion. The initial tweets up here really weren't about
268720	272720	the discussion. It was about this. It was about the corruption culture. It's about that person
272720	277520	who has finally managed to after years of subversion, generally having themselves first
277520	281600	subverted, probably by their university professors, and now doing their own subversion
281600	285440	in the private space. But now that they've finally grasped that little reign of power,
285440	289040	they're using it to make tweaks and saying, you know what? I can do this now. I can do this now.
289040	292880	I can affect this now. If you don't like it, fuck you. I'm the one in charge. That is the
292880	297520	corruption culture. It is going to a property that they didn't create, taking it over from within,
297520	302720	and then turning it to be their political mouthpiece. Now, again, this is Borderlands 3.
302720	307360	It's the pronouns of a robot. This doesn't matter. It's just that this is the most obvious
307360	310880	case of it because this person, I guess they know it doesn't matter, really. It's like a small
310880	315360	thing. So they're just taunting on Twitter. But there are larger and more obvious examples,
315360	318960	and I think we've all seen them before. Let's see how many we can name right off the top of
318960	324640	our heads. The She-Ra reboot. The 2016 Ghostbusters film. Star Trek Discovery and Star Trek Picard.
324640	331280	The new Star Wars trilogy. HBO's Watchmen. Pop culture has been entirely overrun with this shit.
331280	336640	They're all examples of at least some form of failure of these new iterations. New people come
336640	341440	in with new ideas, and fair enough. Sometimes you need those new ideas to bring new stuff to
341440	345360	the table, bring the next generation in, update things. I understand. I get it. You can't just
345360	351120	tell the same stories over and over. But at the same time, these are people who have no respect
351120	355040	for the actual canon of these things, no respect for the fans of these things. These people simply
355040	360800	want to be given the keys to a shiny new supercar, drive it around going way too fast, wreck it,
360800	364960	and then basically escape from the scene of the crime. I mean, do you guys remember when the new
364960	369200	Ghostbusters was announced? The one that was skipping over the 2016 and just acting as like
369200	374080	a sequel to the first two Ghostbusters? Do you remember how much fucking coke that generated?
374080	379040	Because people didn't want to see the continuation of that terrible, terrible movie. So insulting,
379040	384000	like fuck us, we didn't count. It's something Trump would do. Gotta redo Ghostbusters. Better
384000	388640	with men will be huge. Those women ain't Ghostbusters, ugh, so annoying. Such a dick move.
388640	392080	And I don't give a fuck, I'm saying something. What makes this funny is that one, yes, you,
392080	396000	you didn't count. The sales and the fan reaction kind of bear that out. Secondly,
396000	402160	you're acting like returning to form, returning to the original canon is redoing the Ghostbusters,
402160	408000	like you and your version somehow have the ultimate claim on this series. But you don't,
408000	412480	you were the usurper. Remember all the coke that came out of Birds of Prey being a complete bomb?
412480	417120	Please go out and see it. Don't wait. Please don't let hate massage into your sexes and win.
417120	422320	Please go out and see it and need your help and support. Hashtag reasons to support BOP.
422320	427920	Please don't let yet another one of our terrible movies flop. This movie rules and I will not allow
427920	432640	you bitches to let it flop after Joker made a billion dollars. Go fucking see it. Nobody's
432640	436960	watching this shit. And even when they do watch it, like with the case of Star Wars or something,
436960	441760	they're certainly not coming back for more. Star Wars is, bizarrely enough, not the cultural
441760	446480	phenomenon that it used to be. And it's all because of this gross mismanagement of the IP.
446480	449920	At this point, you can pretty much tell if something's going to be shit or not. Not even
449920	453920	by watching the trailers or anything, but just by seeing who's making it and what some of the people
453920	458560	involved are saying about it. Especially some of the people who were part of the old guard.
458560	463280	If they're giving you subtle warning signs, kind of like Joel's voice actor from Last of Us 2,
463280	467520	telling fans to keep an open mind. When they're saying stuff like this, you know that it's
467520	471360	garbage. And I can already hear the reply of some of these corruption culture charlatans.
471360	474720	It's not even out yet. You don't know if it's going to be shit or not. No, no, no. I'm pretty
474720	479040	sure it's going to be shit because it's coming out of an asshole. But speaking of The Last of Us 2.
479040	482960	And by the way, I'm streaming it tonight on Twitch after this video goes out. So hey,
482960	487520	go over there and check it out. But let's see what Neil Druckmann himself has to say about it.
487520	493040	And the first project we started kind of, excuse me, moving forward on was called Mankind.
495200	499520	And the idea is very similar to what you've seen in The Last of Us, that the cordyceps has jumped
499520	506640	from insects to people. And people it infects, it can kind of create monsters or kill them.
508400	514320	But the twist, the thing that was different about this idea was that it only infected women.
515680	519280	And you found the one girl that it didn't infect. And that was Ellie.
520160	523680	And you kind of protected her and try to like bring her to the slab where they were kind of
523680	528960	finding a cure. And there were a lot of things that we were really excited about this idea. But
530480	536480	ultimately, it failed. And the reason it failed is because it was a misogynistic idea. One of the
536480	541040	things that she's going to be kind of really attracted to and attached to as she grows up.
541920	545680	And as a game creator, I look around at kind of what we are making,
546560	551920	and what are going to be her role models from other stories. And I don't like what I see.
551920	559520	More specifically, I'm talking about our female characters.
559520	564240	And whether we want to admit it or not, these are role models. And yet we sexualize,
564240	570080	we objectify, we marginalize, and we reduce these female characters a lot less than they can be.
570080	575440	To me personally, it's hilarious listening to Druckmann talk about how sexy women are bad
575440	580480	role models. Meanwhile, all of the women that he wrote in The Last of Us Part 2 are all psychotic
580480	585840	murderers. Woman wearing a bikini is bad. Woman beating another pregnant woman is good. I don't
585840	592160	know, man, I think I'd take being attractive over being insane. But again, it's all about
592160	597200	coming into spaces that you didn't create, joining companies that you didn't found,
597200	601840	working on franchises and properties that aren't really yours, and then using that newfound
601840	607680	influence to twist them towards your political point of view. That is corruption culture.
607680	612720	And you know, considering that these people love to rant about how parasitic capitalism is,
612720	617200	isn't this the exact example of what they're talking about? I mean, think about it. You have
617920	624480	people with true passion. They cultivate a hobby, or a fandom, or some kind of property. That thing
624480	629040	becomes profitable. A community springs up around it. Sometimes it even becomes a cultural staple.
629040	632720	Then you get people who don't really care about the hobby. Maybe they actively hate it,
632720	636160	like someone like Anita Sarkeesian or something, but they want that cash, they want that money,
636160	641120	and they see it there. So they subvert. They get on the inside. They milk it for short-term
641120	645520	profits. They run it into the ground. They slander their critics as bigots, or they claim
645520	649840	they're gatekeeping. And then these people finally bail out and move on, when the thing that they
649840	655120	have parasitically attached themselves to dies. When the thing that they have corrupted and taken
655120	660480	over is completely twisted and subverted and turned into nothing but a mouthpiece for the
660480	665760	communist fucking manifesto, then they simply move on and do it again somewhere else. These
665760	671920	tyrants with lofty political goals but no actual creativity? They go far beyond fanfiction. They
671920	676080	go far beyond creating their own thing. I don't think they're capable of doing that. They're not
676080	680560	capable of creating something that is iconic or lasting. They have to take over what somebody else
680560	685760	has created and then sculpt it into their image. It's the height of arrogance. And the backlash
685760	692320	to that is frankly only natural. It's kind of like the, I don't know, the psychological equivalent
692320	697840	of preventing your old school bully from knocking you down, stealing your book, and ripping pages
697840	701440	out of it. At this point I've just been talking about pop culture. Even though pop culture is
701440	706560	pretty big, it is in fact in some ways the dominant culture now. But it isn't everything, and it is
706560	710080	ultimately just entertainment. So I understand when somebody would say that it's not that big
710080	713840	of a deal, but I still think that it is. And I think it is because of, and I'm sure you know
713840	719360	what's coming if you've been paying attention, Mr. Yuri Bezmenov. Now this 10 minute clip of
719360	725040	Yuri Bezmenov talking, called Ideological Subversion, is available up on Bitchute.
725040	728800	I will leave a link to this video in the description. Please consider checking it out.
728800	735360	It has to be Bitchute, by the way, because this very same clip was taken down off of YouTube for
735360	741360	apparently violating YouTube's policy on hate speech. Now to be clear, there's nothing hateful
741920	748720	in this clip at all. He simply talks about the strategies that the KGB used back in the 1960s
748720	754480	to long-term subvert the United States population by worming their way into various institutions,
754480	758080	subverting them with Marxism, and then indoctrinating students through the use of
758080	762480	professors. Nothing hateful was said in this at all, and it is honestly ridiculous that YouTube
762480	767040	would take this down. Of course, because YouTube is run by a bunch of monkeys, there is a longer
767040	771920	two-hour variant of that interview that is currently up on YouTube. This will be linked
771920	775120	into the description too, but I have a feeling as soon as YouTube discovers it, it'll probably go
775120	778080	down. Now I'm not going to actually play these videos because I don't want to get my channel
778080	782640	taken off of YouTube, but I will tell you the content of them, at least in my own words.
782640	788320	He describes a process known to the communists as demoralization. The basic idea is that people
788320	794400	would be indoctrinated to a form of self-hatred. Sometimes it's racial self-hatred, sometimes it's
795200	800400	gender-based self-hatred, sometimes it's ethnic self-hatred, sometimes it's nationality self-hatred.
800400	807520	But the point is, you will be taught that what you are intrinsically is bad and evil and wrong
807520	813200	and immoral, even though you were simply born that way, because people superficially like you
813200	818000	in the past in some small way committed crimes against other people. It's basically a divide
818000	823920	and conquer tactic, where across any possible lines, race, gender, class, whatever, they promote
823920	829600	a kind of self-destructiveness. This process is carried out by getting in league with not only
829600	834240	the academics and the universities who will push this stuff onto students, but also into those
834240	839600	people who make popular culture, who in the 1960s made movies and TV shows, and certainly who make
839600	843920	video games and comics today. There's a lot of different values that they push using these
843920	849680	avenues, but probably the most important one is apathy. This all-encompassing nihilism that seems
849680	854800	to be gripping every single person right now. This idea that absolutely nothing matters and therefore
854800	859200	there's no value in the universe and therefore you should do whatever you want and completely
859200	864320	destroy yourself and others in the process. After the demoralization and the apathy, you give the
864320	868880	nation a crisis of some kind. Sometimes it's real, sometimes it's manufactured, doesn't matter really.
868880	875360	In response to that crisis, a demoralized population will simply look for the government to fix it the
875360	880720	simplest and quickest way possible so that they can get back to basically watching TV. This phase
880720	886960	is called normalization, and it's the idea that even though something new is onerous, it simply
886960	892800	becomes accepted by the population as the new way of doing things, the new normal. Have you heard
892800	898560	that phrase uttered recently, the new normal? I remember people saying it about the post-9-11 world
898560	903520	after the Patriot Act, and that new normal sucked. That gave rise to the constant drone strikes in
903520	908080	the Middle East and the NSA perpetually spying on everyone. And due to another crisis that we're
908080	912480	having right now, which by the way I do think is a real crisis not a manufactured one, we're being
912480	917280	told about the new normal again. And we can definitely see the evidence of this cycle of
917280	922080	demoralization, crisis, and normalization repeating again and again. We can see the
922080	925680	footprints of it if we look back throughout the decades. How many idiot socialists and
925680	930240	breadtubers justify their workplace co-op by saying, it's democracy, you love democracy,
930240	935600	lol right? While their audiences either don't know or don't care that America was founded not
935600	939760	as a simple majority democracy, but as a representative republic. How many of those
939760	944800	same people can no longer understand that America's greatness is built and dependent
944800	949920	upon a capitalist economic system, and modern prosperity could not have been built any other
949920	955760	way? If you pay attention, you'll notice that all of socialist and communist culture is created
955760	961280	with the express purpose of demoralizing those who view it. Classical art is inspirational.
961280	965280	Even these statues of people that you might not like, like you know confederate leaders or
965280	970640	something or slave owners or whatever, they are at the very least created proficiently.
970640	976000	To contrast, does modern art look like anything at all? What kind of architecture would you prefer?
976000	981920	Soviet style apartment blocks? Or literally anything else? All of the pieces of pop culture
981920	989040	that I talked about, the fan reaction to them was demoralization. It was, oh my god, I love this
989040	993360	property, I grew up with this, how could you do this to my childhood? And the people holding the
993360	999040	reins of power above them, blatantly shitting on them for daring to criticize them. Saying things
999040	1006400	like, lol too bad, it's canon, I'm in control now, ugliness, grotesqueness, chaos, that is the name
1006400	1011040	of the game when it comes to this type of creation. The commies, the socialists, the intersectionalists,
1011040	1015680	the far left, all of them, they're all utopian. But their artwork, their architecture, their
1015680	1021680	creations are almost entirely either technically deficient, whether that be through bad writing or
1021680	1027520	bad acting or terrible animation like CalArts junk or whatever, or alternatively in the brutal
1027520	1033360	realist style. These things are basically monuments to demoralization. They are the lowest common
1033360	1037920	denominator. And you know what? That actually makes sense. These are people who are utopians.
1037920	1043040	They believe that they will usher in the grand communist utopia should they be allowed to run
1043040	1047120	society the way that they want to run it. And the reason that everything that they produce is utter
1047120	1053440	shit is because they believe that that lowliness, that grotesquery, that brutal realism is actually
1053440	1058720	the peak of all human potential. They believe that we are in fact the lowest common denominator,
1058720	1062960	and that is the best we will ever be, therefore anybody who's better than that has to be cut off
1062960	1067280	at the knees. Which is, of course, entirely in line with their economic worldview. Because
1067280	1071520	whenever the communists get into power, they always slaughter the most productive classes
1071520	1076960	for being too oppressive. Socialism always drags everyone down to the lowest common denominator
1076960	1081680	in the name of redistribution. It only makes sense that all of their creative efforts would
1081680	1089040	do the exact same thing. On my gaming channel, I watched a conference called Games for Change,
1089040	1094800	and it was basically a social justice event taking place around the same time as E3 this year. E3 was
1094800	1099040	spread out and mostly digital due to the coronavirus. But Games for Change was this
1099040	1102320	three-day event. I'm gonna actually do a separate video on it because it was kind of a big thing.
1102400	1107600	And it was basically just demoralization propaganda. It's on the E3 website,
1107600	1112080	so you tune in expecting like new game announcements or something along those lines,
1112080	1117840	and instead you get keynote after keynote, panel after panel of people talking about
1117840	1122640	intersectionality, Black Lives Matter, identity politics, power and privilege,
1122640	1127280	all of these bits of radical left thought. And Games were barely talked about at all.
1127280	1132400	We were sitting there on stream and my girlfriend was actually very demoralized by this. She was
1132400	1136480	like, is this what video games have become? Just being lectured to by these fucking people?
1136480	1139920	And she was actually like emotionally in the dumps for the rest of the day. And I get it.
1139920	1144480	I understand why, but that is their ultimate goal with this stuff. They want to see you broken.
1144480	1150320	They want you to watch them raping those things that you cherish over and over until you accept
1150320	1155920	it. They want you to speak a lie, knowing in your head that it is a lie, and yet they can make you
1155920	1162160	say it anyway. And so because most of us lack institutional power, most of us aren't involved
1162160	1166800	in making video games or shows or movies. Some of us are. And if you're going like the indie route
1166800	1170560	just to kind of make your own thing, good for you. Keep going. If you're like working for
1170560	1174800	Bitchute right now and you watch this video, good for you. Keep going. If we actually have to make
1174800	1179200	an alternate culture just to tell the truth, then that is something we will have to do. And that
1179200	1183520	work is worth doing. But most of us aren't in a position that we can contribute in any big way.
1183520	1188960	So here's what we can do. Always tell the truth as you see it. Don't use that as an excuse to just
1188960	1193040	hurt people because you're going to be blunt or something. Don't do it like that. What I mean is
1193040	1198240	consult your conscience. If you think something is the truth, then stand by it. There may be a
1198240	1202880	social cost to this. It might be steep. Depending on where you live, there might even be a legal
1202880	1208080	cost to this. I don't know. But what was Orwell's quotation on the subject? In a time of universal
1208080	1214240	deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act? Mass demoralization is that time of universal
1214240	1218240	deceit. It is that time when they are going to force you to enjoy your own destruction.
1218240	1222960	It is that time when they are going to force you to repeat and believe their lies. So no matter
1222960	1229040	what, don't let them do it. Speak freely. I'll talk to you next time, guys. I love you.
