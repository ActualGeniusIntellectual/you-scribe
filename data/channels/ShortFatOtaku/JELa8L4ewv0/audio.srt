00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Alright my friends, this is the video that a lot of you have been waiting for.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,600
I've been regularly receiving comments about this video topic for some time now,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,160
so I guess I should get into it. Let's talk about corruption culture.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,280
Yeah, that's the video you wanted, right? I don't know how popular the term

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,520
corruption culture is. It's certainly not nearly as popular as the term

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,760
cancel culture, that's for sure. But corruption culture is still definitely a thing.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,040
Corruption culture refers to the tendency of people on the left to infiltrate certain spaces

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,640
that were, if not apolitical, certainly not left-leaning, and gradually over time

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,160
tilt them towards radical leftist politics. And we've seen this happen for, like, a decade now.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,720
Rational Wiki didn't start out as this bastion of feminist thought, it actually once was

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,880
rational. You head over to the Rational Wiki nowadays and it's basically viewing all the

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,120
topics through an intersectionalist lens, not a rationalist one. It happened with the whole

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,400
atheism plus thing, which for a long time was all, like, Richard Dawkins types, making fun of

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,560
the religious right on the early internet. Well, that got co-opted into atheism plus,

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,840
where it wasn't true atheism unless it had a social justice slant. The online atheist sphere

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
was meant to combat intolerance stemming out of religion, and while there's definitely some

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,760
crossover between that and feminism and anti-racism and etc etc, there's also a lot where it's

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,480
actively opposed, like when you bring Islam into the mix. And gamergate was a corruption culture

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,520
issue too, ultimately. The old SJWs rampaged around the internet like eight-ish years ago,

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
forcing their way into any community they could get into and shitting it up. And it was those

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,520
pesky gamers that told them finally to fuck off, earning them that only partially deserved

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,160
incel reputation in the process. When I'm just kinda talking about internet bullshit so far,

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,760
there is a real aspect to corruption culture that I think we can discuss.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,480
When I made my video on Gearbox Software, in the part talking about Borderlands 3,

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,920
I brought up this series of tweets. From Siran Strange, and this is not some nobody,

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,880
this is somebody who actually worked on Borderlands 3. Flak uses they-them pronouns.

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,320
Print six, I guess. Stop pushing your own ignorance and anxiety on LGBTQ game devs and gamers.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,920
Smooch. Ah. I imagine it's legit difficult playing what could be your first game without

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,520
two-plus options for strictly male characters. That can be legit scary. But you aren't being

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,320
erased. I swear, heart, everyone has a place in this world. We just want to give options to those

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,360
who've never had them. And if, after that, you still find yourself spitting mad, fuck you,

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,400
it's 100% canon. Retweeting this again, this one goes out to all the haters out there.

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
I hope you find what you need in your own life to be fulfilled enough that you no longer feel

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,960
the urge to be a wank-not. This is in reference to a robot character named Flak, and how they use

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,200
they-them pronouns, presumably because they're a robot and therefore they wouldn't need a gender.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,080
I guess that makes sense. I don't really care too much because Borderlands 3 was absolute fucking

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,040
garbage. But the point is, read this condescension, guys. Like, I've played a lot of games where there

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,000
was no option to play as male characters. I'm fine with it. I think most people are honestly fine

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,680
with it. This whole thing, you aren't being erased, I swear. Like, they talk a lot about

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,160
trans erasure, or, you know, about LGBT erasure, whatever. Erasure is the method in which, in

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,280
narratives and storytelling, you basically get rid of things that are kind of outside the norm.

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,480
This was known for a while as burying your gays, meaning that in TV shows and movies,

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,920
especially in the 90s, even though there was gay representation, the gay characters often

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
always died very early into the narrative, or they left the show, or something like that.

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,440
But the reason this person words it like this, like, you know, you aren't being erased, I swear,

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,040
there's a reason for that. It's because they know that they've wormed their way into a position of

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,480
power, and they're going to inject their own politics wherever they can now that they're

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,960
there. You can see both the olive branch and the knife, you know, in the two separate tweets.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,920
It's like, come on board with the LGBT agenda. Oh, you don't want to? Fuck you.

50
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,480
And as you scroll through the actual replies, you see something like this here.

51
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm getting so tired of people blatantly using the wrong pronouns for flack. Legit saw someone

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,400
say the pronouns don't matter. It does not impact the character as if gender identity isn't a highly

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,480
important part of who someone is. It's a fucking robot. In this case, in this specific case,

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,840
where it's a robot and not a human. Yeah, that gender identity doesn't really matter. Like,

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,240
who fucking cares, right? And there is some discussion on both sides of the aisle happening

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
here. But this really isn't about the discussion. The initial tweets up here really weren't about

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
the discussion. It was about this. It was about the corruption culture. It's about that person

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,520
who has finally managed to after years of subversion, generally having themselves first

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,600
subverted, probably by their university professors, and now doing their own subversion

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,440
in the private space. But now that they've finally grasped that little reign of power,

61
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
they're using it to make tweaks and saying, you know what? I can do this now. I can do this now.

62
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,880
I can affect this now. If you don't like it, fuck you. I'm the one in charge. That is the

63
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
corruption culture. It is going to a property that they didn't create, taking it over from within,

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,720
and then turning it to be their political mouthpiece. Now, again, this is Borderlands 3.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
It's the pronouns of a robot. This doesn't matter. It's just that this is the most obvious

66
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
case of it because this person, I guess they know it doesn't matter, really. It's like a small

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,360
thing. So they're just taunting on Twitter. But there are larger and more obvious examples,

68
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
and I think we've all seen them before. Let's see how many we can name right off the top of

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,640
our heads. The She-Ra reboot. The 2016 Ghostbusters film. Star Trek Discovery and Star Trek Picard.

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,280
The new Star Wars trilogy. HBO's Watchmen. Pop culture has been entirely overrun with this shit.

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,640
They're all examples of at least some form of failure of these new iterations. New people come

72
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,440
in with new ideas, and fair enough. Sometimes you need those new ideas to bring new stuff to

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,360
the table, bring the next generation in, update things. I understand. I get it. You can't just

74
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,120
tell the same stories over and over. But at the same time, these are people who have no respect

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,040
for the actual canon of these things, no respect for the fans of these things. These people simply

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,800
want to be given the keys to a shiny new supercar, drive it around going way too fast, wreck it,

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
and then basically escape from the scene of the crime. I mean, do you guys remember when the new

78
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,200
Ghostbusters was announced? The one that was skipping over the 2016 and just acting as like

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,080
a sequel to the first two Ghostbusters? Do you remember how much fucking coke that generated?

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,040
Because people didn't want to see the continuation of that terrible, terrible movie. So insulting,

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,000
like fuck us, we didn't count. It's something Trump would do. Gotta redo Ghostbusters. Better

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,640
with men will be huge. Those women ain't Ghostbusters, ugh, so annoying. Such a dick move.

83
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,080
And I don't give a fuck, I'm saying something. What makes this funny is that one, yes, you,

84
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,000
you didn't count. The sales and the fan reaction kind of bear that out. Secondly,

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,160
you're acting like returning to form, returning to the original canon is redoing the Ghostbusters,

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,000
like you and your version somehow have the ultimate claim on this series. But you don't,

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,480
you were the usurper. Remember all the coke that came out of Birds of Prey being a complete bomb?

88
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,120
Please go out and see it. Don't wait. Please don't let hate massage into your sexes and win.

89
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,320
Please go out and see it and need your help and support. Hashtag reasons to support BOP.

90
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Please don't let yet another one of our terrible movies flop. This movie rules and I will not allow

91
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,640
you bitches to let it flop after Joker made a billion dollars. Go fucking see it. Nobody's

92
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,960
watching this shit. And even when they do watch it, like with the case of Star Wars or something,

93
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,760
they're certainly not coming back for more. Star Wars is, bizarrely enough, not the cultural

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,480
phenomenon that it used to be. And it's all because of this gross mismanagement of the IP.

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,920
At this point, you can pretty much tell if something's going to be shit or not. Not even

96
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,920
by watching the trailers or anything, but just by seeing who's making it and what some of the people

97
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,560
involved are saying about it. Especially some of the people who were part of the old guard.

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,280
If they're giving you subtle warning signs, kind of like Joel's voice actor from Last of Us 2,

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
telling fans to keep an open mind. When they're saying stuff like this, you know that it's

100
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,360
garbage. And I can already hear the reply of some of these corruption culture charlatans.

101
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,720
It's not even out yet. You don't know if it's going to be shit or not. No, no, no. I'm pretty

102
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,040
sure it's going to be shit because it's coming out of an asshole. But speaking of The Last of Us 2.

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,960
And by the way, I'm streaming it tonight on Twitch after this video goes out. So hey,

104
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,520
go over there and check it out. But let's see what Neil Druckmann himself has to say about it.

105
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,040
And the first project we started kind of, excuse me, moving forward on was called Mankind.

106
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,520
And the idea is very similar to what you've seen in The Last of Us, that the cordyceps has jumped

107
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,640
from insects to people. And people it infects, it can kind of create monsters or kill them.

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,320
But the twist, the thing that was different about this idea was that it only infected women.

109
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,280
And you found the one girl that it didn't infect. And that was Ellie.

110
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,680
And you kind of protected her and try to like bring her to the slab where they were kind of

111
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,960
finding a cure. And there were a lot of things that we were really excited about this idea. But

112
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,480
ultimately, it failed. And the reason it failed is because it was a misogynistic idea. One of the

113
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,040
things that she's going to be kind of really attracted to and attached to as she grows up.

114
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,680
And as a game creator, I look around at kind of what we are making,

115
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,920
and what are going to be her role models from other stories. And I don't like what I see.

116
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,520
More specifically, I'm talking about our female characters.

117
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,240
And whether we want to admit it or not, these are role models. And yet we sexualize,

118
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,080
we objectify, we marginalize, and we reduce these female characters a lot less than they can be.

119
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,440
To me personally, it's hilarious listening to Druckmann talk about how sexy women are bad

120
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,480
role models. Meanwhile, all of the women that he wrote in The Last of Us Part 2 are all psychotic

121
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,840
murderers. Woman wearing a bikini is bad. Woman beating another pregnant woman is good. I don't

122
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,160
know, man, I think I'd take being attractive over being insane. But again, it's all about

123
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,200
coming into spaces that you didn't create, joining companies that you didn't found,

124
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,840
working on franchises and properties that aren't really yours, and then using that newfound

125
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,680
influence to twist them towards your political point of view. That is corruption culture.

126
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
And you know, considering that these people love to rant about how parasitic capitalism is,

127
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
isn't this the exact example of what they're talking about? I mean, think about it. You have

128
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,480
people with true passion. They cultivate a hobby, or a fandom, or some kind of property. That thing

129
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,040
becomes profitable. A community springs up around it. Sometimes it even becomes a cultural staple.

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,720
Then you get people who don't really care about the hobby. Maybe they actively hate it,

131
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
like someone like Anita Sarkeesian or something, but they want that cash, they want that money,

132
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,120
and they see it there. So they subvert. They get on the inside. They milk it for short-term

133
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,520
profits. They run it into the ground. They slander their critics as bigots, or they claim

134
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,840
they're gatekeeping. And then these people finally bail out and move on, when the thing that they

135
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,120
have parasitically attached themselves to dies. When the thing that they have corrupted and taken

136
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,480
over is completely twisted and subverted and turned into nothing but a mouthpiece for the

137
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,760
communist fucking manifesto, then they simply move on and do it again somewhere else. These

138
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,920
tyrants with lofty political goals but no actual creativity? They go far beyond fanfiction. They

139
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,080
go far beyond creating their own thing. I don't think they're capable of doing that. They're not

140
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,560
capable of creating something that is iconic or lasting. They have to take over what somebody else

141
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,760
has created and then sculpt it into their image. It's the height of arrogance. And the backlash

142
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,320
to that is frankly only natural. It's kind of like the, I don't know, the psychological equivalent

143
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,840
of preventing your old school bully from knocking you down, stealing your book, and ripping pages

144
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,440
out of it. At this point I've just been talking about pop culture. Even though pop culture is

145
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,560
pretty big, it is in fact in some ways the dominant culture now. But it isn't everything, and it is

146
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,080
ultimately just entertainment. So I understand when somebody would say that it's not that big

147
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,840
of a deal, but I still think that it is. And I think it is because of, and I'm sure you know

148
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,360
what's coming if you've been paying attention, Mr. Yuri Bezmenov. Now this 10 minute clip of

149
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,040
Yuri Bezmenov talking, called Ideological Subversion, is available up on Bitchute.

150
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
I will leave a link to this video in the description. Please consider checking it out.

151
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,360
It has to be Bitchute, by the way, because this very same clip was taken down off of YouTube for

152
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,360
apparently violating YouTube's policy on hate speech. Now to be clear, there's nothing hateful

153
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,720
in this clip at all. He simply talks about the strategies that the KGB used back in the 1960s

154
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,480
to long-term subvert the United States population by worming their way into various institutions,

155
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,080
subverting them with Marxism, and then indoctrinating students through the use of

156
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,480
professors. Nothing hateful was said in this at all, and it is honestly ridiculous that YouTube

157
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,040
would take this down. Of course, because YouTube is run by a bunch of monkeys, there is a longer

158
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,920
two-hour variant of that interview that is currently up on YouTube. This will be linked

159
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,120
into the description too, but I have a feeling as soon as YouTube discovers it, it'll probably go

160
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,080
down. Now I'm not going to actually play these videos because I don't want to get my channel

161
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,640
taken off of YouTube, but I will tell you the content of them, at least in my own words.

162
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,320
He describes a process known to the communists as demoralization. The basic idea is that people

163
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,400
would be indoctrinated to a form of self-hatred. Sometimes it's racial self-hatred, sometimes it's

164
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,400
gender-based self-hatred, sometimes it's ethnic self-hatred, sometimes it's nationality self-hatred.

165
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:27,520
But the point is, you will be taught that what you are intrinsically is bad and evil and wrong

166
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,200
and immoral, even though you were simply born that way, because people superficially like you

167
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
in the past in some small way committed crimes against other people. It's basically a divide

168
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,920
and conquer tactic, where across any possible lines, race, gender, class, whatever, they promote

169
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,600
a kind of self-destructiveness. This process is carried out by getting in league with not only

170
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,240
the academics and the universities who will push this stuff onto students, but also into those

171
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,600
people who make popular culture, who in the 1960s made movies and TV shows, and certainly who make

172
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,920
video games and comics today. There's a lot of different values that they push using these

173
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,680
avenues, but probably the most important one is apathy. This all-encompassing nihilism that seems

174
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,800
to be gripping every single person right now. This idea that absolutely nothing matters and therefore

175
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,200
there's no value in the universe and therefore you should do whatever you want and completely

176
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,320
destroy yourself and others in the process. After the demoralization and the apathy, you give the

177
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,880
nation a crisis of some kind. Sometimes it's real, sometimes it's manufactured, doesn't matter really.

178
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,360
In response to that crisis, a demoralized population will simply look for the government to fix it the

179
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,720
simplest and quickest way possible so that they can get back to basically watching TV. This phase

180
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,960
is called normalization, and it's the idea that even though something new is onerous, it simply

181
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,800
becomes accepted by the population as the new way of doing things, the new normal. Have you heard

182
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,560
that phrase uttered recently, the new normal? I remember people saying it about the post-9-11 world

183
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,520
after the Patriot Act, and that new normal sucked. That gave rise to the constant drone strikes in

184
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,080
the Middle East and the NSA perpetually spying on everyone. And due to another crisis that we're

185
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,480
having right now, which by the way I do think is a real crisis not a manufactured one, we're being

186
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,280
told about the new normal again. And we can definitely see the evidence of this cycle of

187
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,080
demoralization, crisis, and normalization repeating again and again. We can see the

188
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,680
footprints of it if we look back throughout the decades. How many idiot socialists and

189
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,240
breadtubers justify their workplace co-op by saying, it's democracy, you love democracy,

190
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
lol right? While their audiences either don't know or don't care that America was founded not

191
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,760
as a simple majority democracy, but as a representative republic. How many of those

192
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,800
same people can no longer understand that America's greatness is built and dependent

193
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,920
upon a capitalist economic system, and modern prosperity could not have been built any other

194
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,760
way? If you pay attention, you'll notice that all of socialist and communist culture is created

195
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,280
with the express purpose of demoralizing those who view it. Classical art is inspirational.

196
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Even these statues of people that you might not like, like you know confederate leaders or

197
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,640
something or slave owners or whatever, they are at the very least created proficiently.

198
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,000
To contrast, does modern art look like anything at all? What kind of architecture would you prefer?

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,920
Soviet style apartment blocks? Or literally anything else? All of the pieces of pop culture

200
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,040
that I talked about, the fan reaction to them was demoralization. It was, oh my god, I love this

201
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,360
property, I grew up with this, how could you do this to my childhood? And the people holding the

202
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,040
reins of power above them, blatantly shitting on them for daring to criticize them. Saying things

203
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,400
like, lol too bad, it's canon, I'm in control now, ugliness, grotesqueness, chaos, that is the name

204
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,040
of the game when it comes to this type of creation. The commies, the socialists, the intersectionalists,

205
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,680
the far left, all of them, they're all utopian. But their artwork, their architecture, their

206
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,680
creations are almost entirely either technically deficient, whether that be through bad writing or

207
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,520
bad acting or terrible animation like CalArts junk or whatever, or alternatively in the brutal

208
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,360
realist style. These things are basically monuments to demoralization. They are the lowest common

209
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,920
denominator. And you know what? That actually makes sense. These are people who are utopians.

210
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,040
They believe that they will usher in the grand communist utopia should they be allowed to run

211
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,120
society the way that they want to run it. And the reason that everything that they produce is utter

212
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,440
shit is because they believe that that lowliness, that grotesquery, that brutal realism is actually

213
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,720
the peak of all human potential. They believe that we are in fact the lowest common denominator,

214
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,960
and that is the best we will ever be, therefore anybody who's better than that has to be cut off

215
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,280
at the knees. Which is, of course, entirely in line with their economic worldview. Because

216
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,520
whenever the communists get into power, they always slaughter the most productive classes

217
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,960
for being too oppressive. Socialism always drags everyone down to the lowest common denominator

218
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,680
in the name of redistribution. It only makes sense that all of their creative efforts would

219
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,040
do the exact same thing. On my gaming channel, I watched a conference called Games for Change,

220
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,800
and it was basically a social justice event taking place around the same time as E3 this year. E3 was

221
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,040
spread out and mostly digital due to the coronavirus. But Games for Change was this

222
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,320
three-day event. I'm gonna actually do a separate video on it because it was kind of a big thing.

223
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,600
And it was basically just demoralization propaganda. It's on the E3 website,

224
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,080
so you tune in expecting like new game announcements or something along those lines,

225
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,840
and instead you get keynote after keynote, panel after panel of people talking about

226
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,640
intersectionality, Black Lives Matter, identity politics, power and privilege,

227
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
all of these bits of radical left thought. And Games were barely talked about at all.

228
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,400
We were sitting there on stream and my girlfriend was actually very demoralized by this. She was

229
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,480
like, is this what video games have become? Just being lectured to by these fucking people?

230
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,920
And she was actually like emotionally in the dumps for the rest of the day. And I get it.

231
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,480
I understand why, but that is their ultimate goal with this stuff. They want to see you broken.

232
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,320
They want you to watch them raping those things that you cherish over and over until you accept

233
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,920
it. They want you to speak a lie, knowing in your head that it is a lie, and yet they can make you

234
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:22,160
say it anyway. And so because most of us lack institutional power, most of us aren't involved

235
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,800
in making video games or shows or movies. Some of us are. And if you're going like the indie route

236
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,560
just to kind of make your own thing, good for you. Keep going. If you're like working for

237
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,800
Bitchute right now and you watch this video, good for you. Keep going. If we actually have to make

238
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,200
an alternate culture just to tell the truth, then that is something we will have to do. And that

239
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,520
work is worth doing. But most of us aren't in a position that we can contribute in any big way.

240
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,960
So here's what we can do. Always tell the truth as you see it. Don't use that as an excuse to just

241
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,040
hurt people because you're going to be blunt or something. Don't do it like that. What I mean is

242
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,240
consult your conscience. If you think something is the truth, then stand by it. There may be a

243
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
social cost to this. It might be steep. Depending on where you live, there might even be a legal

244
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,080
cost to this. I don't know. But what was Orwell's quotation on the subject? In a time of universal

245
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,240
deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act? Mass demoralization is that time of universal

246
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
deceit. It is that time when they are going to force you to enjoy your own destruction.

247
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,960
It is that time when they are going to force you to repeat and believe their lies. So no matter

248
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,040
what, don't let them do it. Speak freely. I'll talk to you next time, guys. I love you.
