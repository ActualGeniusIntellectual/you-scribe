0	7680	This video is primarily a message to Carrie from the um the KezBox channel who may end up locking
7680	11440	her twitter account as a result of this video because the last time I talked about her she did
11440	15680	the same thing but I just want to let you know beforehand you don't have to do that however if
15680	21120	you're just a regular viewer of mine watching this video let me give you the backstory and most
21120	26720	importantly of all uh please don't contact this person all right so here's the back end of my
26720	32400	channel there's the JK Rowling video the cancel crowd share video I hope you enjoyed that uh
32400	39920	that pun the Qtees video 9 11 am I a fascist that was a fun one uh but I'll just scroll down
39920	48960	check it out oh the uh the KezBox debate is back see it's no longer everyone can see this video
49920	52880	now it's not blocked or anything you can go to it
53200	66880	and as you can see it is available again now some of you may may remember this video was gone for a
66880	72080	while I mean it's three or four weeks old but it's back now so if you want to go watch it you
72080	81200	can go watch it if you like what this video is is I went on this person's um stream at their at
81200	86960	their request and just had a friendly chat with them at least I I thought it was a friendly chat
86960	93440	until after an hour and 12 minutes she kicked me off which is her right it's her stream
94000	97280	she doesn't need to talk to anybody that she doesn't want to talk to now I have a kind of
97280	103840	specific problem with myself I'm kind of anal about some things I like the work that I do to um
103840	107680	to not disappear I like watching old spoonie videos but the problem with spoonie is that
107680	112240	half of his catalog had disappeared since a lot of them were on blip tv so I have to go to like
112240	118240	five different spoonie fan channels on youtube that have like various commentaries and vlogs
118240	123280	and reviews that have since been lost the time and even though I know that I'm a small youtuber
123280	130160	I have always wanted some kind of canonical consistency with my work so even though this
130160	135360	channel is no longer about the old anime reviews from 2009 those still exist on a side channel
135360	139840	even though game boomers get significantly more traction on twitch than on youtube
139840	144960	I still upload all of the streams to the game boomers youtube channel even though there's
144960	149280	not really that many viewers of them but I just like things to be around I don't like the idea
149280	155200	of having content that is lost to time that kind of bothers me it bothers me when creators that
155200	159440	I watch do it so just in case there's somebody out there who actually cares about me I don't
159440	163920	want to do it to them so I like to archive everything that I do it's just a quirk of my
163920	170480	personality so I figured after this conversation with carrie I would simply put the video up on my
170480	175600	youtube channel so that it wouldn't get lost however she didn't like that she filed a copyright
175600	181600	strike on my channel on august 28th four days after I put the video up and I think five days
181600	188000	after the actual debate took place her reasoning was he's literally recorded and uploaded a chunk
188000	194240	of my live stream without my permission which I wouldn't have given I didn't even say I'd be in
194240	200240	a video of his well that's correct it was my recording of the live stream because it was a
200240	204640	conversation that both of us had and even though she filed a copyright strike to get the video
204640	210320	taken down it is my belief that that strike was likely incorrect this is from the university of
210320	217200	stanford's fair use page who owns the copyright in a joint work when two or more authors prepare
217200	221840	a work with the intent to combine their contributions into inseparable or interdependent
221840	228160	parts the work is considered joint work and the authors are considered joint copyright owners the
228160	233520	most common example of a joint work is when a book or article has two or more authors now I didn't
233520	239440	upload her entire stream nor would I have I didn't even upload the part after she kicked me out of it
239440	244960	where she spent some time discussing with her friends exactly what she thought of me I only
244960	250640	uploaded my contribution it just so happens that my contribution was in some way inseparable with
250640	256720	hers now it's not like she didn't want to make this combined work in fact she invited me on
256720	260800	the stream herself I mean you can hop on discord if you want that's not a problem
263200	267680	there you go you can hop off on discord if it'll be easier and she also tweeted about it short
267680	273360	photo talk was in my chat talking about the sargon video youtuber and sargon friend mentioned in
273360	279360	carl gone's new video as having a back and forth with shoe is in my fucking chat right the fuck now
280000	285680	she seemed quite excited at the prospect at least at the time this person here says if sargon of a
285680	290160	cat I don't think that's a real twitter account dude can't seem to understand the idea of socialist
290160	296240	democrats why doesn't he just talk to the surf's tv and then carrie says or me so she wants to talk
296240	302000	to sargon now the way his friend friend is in quotes do you not believe that sargon and I are
302000	307440	friends and defender stand tried to it just got boring considering he was unable to actually
307440	312720	answer a question well if you actually go back and watch our discussion there are multiple times
312720	317760	where carrie said something along the lines of I see what you're saying or I understand or that's
317760	324160	not a bad take she says imagine being so pathetic that you basically stalk and try to bully a small
324160	330240	streamer hilarious do these twats realize that it often makes us more popular well if it makes you
330240	336560	more popular why would you file a false copyright strike to get the video taken down surely you
336560	341600	would want the publicity and no I've never had any intention of bullying you or anybody else that
341600	347280	I've talked to I mean I've made some serious mistakes especially recently we don't have to
347280	353840	re-go over those I don't think but the point is I don't view size as being part of the discussion
353840	357520	I will talk to somebody who is much bigger than me I will talk to somebody who is much smaller
357520	363680	than me we are all fundamentally the same we're equal I figured that as somebody who prioritizes
364400	369600	the virtue of equality you would kind of appreciate that position it doesn't matter to
369600	375040	you if you have 200 subs or 2 million subs as long as you're willing to talk in good faith that's
375040	380480	fine with me I'm not out here trying to own anybody I just want to have decent discussions
380480	386320	maybe come to some sort of understanding that's all and it's not stalking to talk about you if
386320	390800	you're a public figure it's not stalking when you invite me on your own stream and then we have a
390800	396640	conversation that I guess you didn't like how it went and it's certainly not stalking to reply to
396640	402880	a false DMCA takedown so after that reactionary youtuber hopped into my chat SFO it wouldn't
402880	408080	surprise me if he ended up trying to own me for content in his next youtube video because I yeeted
408080	413440	him after an hour of him not answering questions and talking in pointless circles well we actually
413440	417600	covered multiple different topics of conversation we didn't go in circles we actually like
417600	421360	went through multiple full topics and kind of argued them to their conclusion because
421920	425520	I thought we were having a good faith discussion there were multiple times where I straight up
425520	430640	agreed with you and I still do and no this video is not the own that you're looking for
431440	437600	like I said I'm not here to blow you out so after deciding to harass a small twitch streamer who
437600	442880	wasn't even prepared for the conversation short fat otaku decided to upload it the comment section
442880	448560	is wild again you invited me on I didn't say anything harassing towards you and neither of
448560	453120	us were prepared for the conversation I was literally surfing through random channels on
453120	459920	twitch I saw the name Sargon in your twitch title and I checked you out that was it literally your
459920	464480	own SEO brought me to your stream which was basically the point to attract new viewers
464480	468320	wasn't it the commenter here says who wasn't prepared how did this conversation get arranged
468400	473120	and Carrie says I wasn't and it didn't well I wasn't prepared either I didn't really have
473120	477040	any sort like I had one source because I had used it earlier that day and something else but
477040	481360	I didn't have sources to back up what I was talking about I had to look up um the Vancouver
481360	486800	housing crisis because I had no sources and it got arranged by you inviting me on imagine having
486800	492880	almost 100k subs on youtube and deciding to spend your time debating extremely tiny twitch streamers
492880	498480	rather than you know vosh well regardless of my own problems with debating vosh at this point I
498480	503200	don't think vosh would actually do it and only for the reason because he's more than double my size
503200	508000	now he already said that he doesn't want to make somebody else's career he's kind of thinking in
508000	512480	the same terms that uh Styx Hexenhammer was thinking and when vosh challenged him to a debate
512480	516800	so I actually don't think that vosh would talk to me but let's keep reading he acts like he's the
516800	521200	big man here but refuses to engage in debate with people his own size and with significant debate
521200	527200	experience well one I have no significant debate experience again another reason why I wouldn't
527200	531840	debate vosh because I'm not a debate bro but secondly like I said I consider all of us to be
531840	537360	equal it doesn't matter who has more or less subs it doesn't matter who you are what matters are the
537360	541920	ideas of course Kerry says he also doesn't seem to realize that this sort of shit brings us more
541920	546960	viewers well again why did you copyright strike the video SFO is a reactionary who know that
546960	551120	they're garbage they refuse to engage with big lefty creators and instead harass small ones
551120	555760	for somebody who is all about the removal of hierarchy you're really depending on it here
555760	559600	aren't you let me make it absolutely clear in a way that I think you can appreciate Kerry there
559600	564080	is no difference between the two of us we're all human the only thing that's different is how we
564080	570640	think I think that you made this strike not truly knowing what the DMCA is for which is why by the
570640	575520	way youtube has taken my side and reinstated the video from a legal perspective I didn't
575520	581360	need your permission to re-upload my appearance on your stream because it is my appearance but
581360	586160	I can also understand the stages of thought that you went through on the 24th you invited me to be
586160	590880	there you were very happy that I was you were excited on the 25th you spent a significant
590880	596240	amount of time insulting me stating that you had no idea why I was there and talking about how
596240	602480	happy that you were that I gave you exposure and then on the 28th you abused youtube's DMCA
602480	608320	takedown notices to remove that very same source of exposure that three days earlier you were very
608320	612480	happy about so I kind of get it you went through the various stages you weren't necessarily
612480	616560	prepared even though I wasn't either but I understand I understand your position entirely
616560	622160	so even though I do not necessarily expect you to actually reply to this I will leave this on
622160	627040	the table and you can take me up on it anytime you like I understand being nervous I understand
627040	632400	feeling attacked even if you weren't actually attacked I understand feeling that way so for me
632400	638480	Kerry this is all water under the bridge if you ever want to continue our conversation you can
638480	645520	drop into my discord I'll stream it and I promise you I won't kick you out I won't mute you and we
645520	650560	can take as much time as you like getting to the bottom of some of these issues if for some reason
650560	656160	you'd rather not stream it and you'd rather us pre-record it I can do that too like I said I'm
656160	660400	not a debate bro because if you really watch that video in good faith I think we agreed more than we
660400	664960	disagree on a lot of things in any case Kerry the ball's in your court you don't have to take me up
664960	669600	on it in fact if you simply decided to shit talk me on twitter for another couple days and then
669600	675360	ignore that I ever existed fine I wouldn't take it personally and as always my friends please don't
675360	679680	go and harass this person all right this is not about the egos involved it truly is about the
679680	684000	issues all right I'll talk to you guys next time I love you
