1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
This video is primarily a message to Carrie from the um the KezBox channel who may end up locking

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,440
her twitter account as a result of this video because the last time I talked about her she did

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,680
the same thing but I just want to let you know beforehand you don't have to do that however if

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,120
you're just a regular viewer of mine watching this video let me give you the backstory and most

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,720
importantly of all uh please don't contact this person all right so here's the back end of my

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,400
channel there's the JK Rowling video the cancel crowd share video I hope you enjoyed that uh

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,920
that pun the Qtees video 9 11 am I a fascist that was a fun one uh but I'll just scroll down

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,960
check it out oh the uh the KezBox debate is back see it's no longer everyone can see this video

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,880
now it's not blocked or anything you can go to it

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:06,880
and as you can see it is available again now some of you may may remember this video was gone for a

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,080
while I mean it's three or four weeks old but it's back now so if you want to go watch it you

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:21,200
can go watch it if you like what this video is is I went on this person's um stream at their at

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
their request and just had a friendly chat with them at least I I thought it was a friendly chat

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,440
until after an hour and 12 minutes she kicked me off which is her right it's her stream

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
she doesn't need to talk to anybody that she doesn't want to talk to now I have a kind of

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,840
specific problem with myself I'm kind of anal about some things I like the work that I do to um

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
to not disappear I like watching old spoonie videos but the problem with spoonie is that

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
half of his catalog had disappeared since a lot of them were on blip tv so I have to go to like

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,240
five different spoonie fan channels on youtube that have like various commentaries and vlogs

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,280
and reviews that have since been lost the time and even though I know that I'm a small youtuber

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,160
I have always wanted some kind of canonical consistency with my work so even though this

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,360
channel is no longer about the old anime reviews from 2009 those still exist on a side channel

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,840
even though game boomers get significantly more traction on twitch than on youtube

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,960
I still upload all of the streams to the game boomers youtube channel even though there's

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,280
not really that many viewers of them but I just like things to be around I don't like the idea

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,200
of having content that is lost to time that kind of bothers me it bothers me when creators that

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
I watch do it so just in case there's somebody out there who actually cares about me I don't

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,920
want to do it to them so I like to archive everything that I do it's just a quirk of my

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,480
personality so I figured after this conversation with carrie I would simply put the video up on my

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,600
youtube channel so that it wouldn't get lost however she didn't like that she filed a copyright

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,600
strike on my channel on august 28th four days after I put the video up and I think five days

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,000
after the actual debate took place her reasoning was he's literally recorded and uploaded a chunk

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,240
of my live stream without my permission which I wouldn't have given I didn't even say I'd be in

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,240
a video of his well that's correct it was my recording of the live stream because it was a

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,640
conversation that both of us had and even though she filed a copyright strike to get the video

36
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,320
taken down it is my belief that that strike was likely incorrect this is from the university of

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,200
stanford's fair use page who owns the copyright in a joint work when two or more authors prepare

38
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,840
a work with the intent to combine their contributions into inseparable or interdependent

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,160
parts the work is considered joint work and the authors are considered joint copyright owners the

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,520
most common example of a joint work is when a book or article has two or more authors now I didn't

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,440
upload her entire stream nor would I have I didn't even upload the part after she kicked me out of it

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,960
where she spent some time discussing with her friends exactly what she thought of me I only

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,640
uploaded my contribution it just so happens that my contribution was in some way inseparable with

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,720
hers now it's not like she didn't want to make this combined work in fact she invited me on

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,800
the stream herself I mean you can hop on discord if you want that's not a problem

46
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,680
there you go you can hop off on discord if it'll be easier and she also tweeted about it short

47
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,360
photo talk was in my chat talking about the sargon video youtuber and sargon friend mentioned in

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
carl gone's new video as having a back and forth with shoe is in my fucking chat right the fuck now

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,680
she seemed quite excited at the prospect at least at the time this person here says if sargon of a

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,160
cat I don't think that's a real twitter account dude can't seem to understand the idea of socialist

51
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,240
democrats why doesn't he just talk to the surf's tv and then carrie says or me so she wants to talk

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,000
to sargon now the way his friend friend is in quotes do you not believe that sargon and I are

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,440
friends and defender stand tried to it just got boring considering he was unable to actually

54
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,720
answer a question well if you actually go back and watch our discussion there are multiple times

55
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,760
where carrie said something along the lines of I see what you're saying or I understand or that's

56
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,160
not a bad take she says imagine being so pathetic that you basically stalk and try to bully a small

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,240
streamer hilarious do these twats realize that it often makes us more popular well if it makes you

58
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,560
more popular why would you file a false copyright strike to get the video taken down surely you

59
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,600
would want the publicity and no I've never had any intention of bullying you or anybody else that

60
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,280
I've talked to I mean I've made some serious mistakes especially recently we don't have to

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,840
re-go over those I don't think but the point is I don't view size as being part of the discussion

62
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
I will talk to somebody who is much bigger than me I will talk to somebody who is much smaller

63
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,680
than me we are all fundamentally the same we're equal I figured that as somebody who prioritizes

64
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,600
the virtue of equality you would kind of appreciate that position it doesn't matter to

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,040
you if you have 200 subs or 2 million subs as long as you're willing to talk in good faith that's

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,480
fine with me I'm not out here trying to own anybody I just want to have decent discussions

67
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,320
maybe come to some sort of understanding that's all and it's not stalking to talk about you if

68
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,800
you're a public figure it's not stalking when you invite me on your own stream and then we have a

69
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,640
conversation that I guess you didn't like how it went and it's certainly not stalking to reply to

70
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,880
a false DMCA takedown so after that reactionary youtuber hopped into my chat SFO it wouldn't

71
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,080
surprise me if he ended up trying to own me for content in his next youtube video because I yeeted

72
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,440
him after an hour of him not answering questions and talking in pointless circles well we actually

73
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,600
covered multiple different topics of conversation we didn't go in circles we actually like

74
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,360
went through multiple full topics and kind of argued them to their conclusion because

75
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,520
I thought we were having a good faith discussion there were multiple times where I straight up

76
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,640
agreed with you and I still do and no this video is not the own that you're looking for

77
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,600
like I said I'm not here to blow you out so after deciding to harass a small twitch streamer who

78
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,880
wasn't even prepared for the conversation short fat otaku decided to upload it the comment section

79
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,560
is wild again you invited me on I didn't say anything harassing towards you and neither of

80
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,120
us were prepared for the conversation I was literally surfing through random channels on

81
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,920
twitch I saw the name Sargon in your twitch title and I checked you out that was it literally your

82
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,480
own SEO brought me to your stream which was basically the point to attract new viewers

83
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,320
wasn't it the commenter here says who wasn't prepared how did this conversation get arranged

84
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,120
and Carrie says I wasn't and it didn't well I wasn't prepared either I didn't really have

85
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,040
any sort like I had one source because I had used it earlier that day and something else but

86
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,360
I didn't have sources to back up what I was talking about I had to look up um the Vancouver

87
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,800
housing crisis because I had no sources and it got arranged by you inviting me on imagine having

88
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,880
almost 100k subs on youtube and deciding to spend your time debating extremely tiny twitch streamers

89
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,480
rather than you know vosh well regardless of my own problems with debating vosh at this point I

90
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,200
don't think vosh would actually do it and only for the reason because he's more than double my size

91
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,000
now he already said that he doesn't want to make somebody else's career he's kind of thinking in

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,480
the same terms that uh Styx Hexenhammer was thinking and when vosh challenged him to a debate

93
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,800
so I actually don't think that vosh would talk to me but let's keep reading he acts like he's the

94
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,200
big man here but refuses to engage in debate with people his own size and with significant debate

95
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,200
experience well one I have no significant debate experience again another reason why I wouldn't

96
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,840
debate vosh because I'm not a debate bro but secondly like I said I consider all of us to be

97
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,360
equal it doesn't matter who has more or less subs it doesn't matter who you are what matters are the

98
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,920
ideas of course Kerry says he also doesn't seem to realize that this sort of shit brings us more

99
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,960
viewers well again why did you copyright strike the video SFO is a reactionary who know that

100
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,120
they're garbage they refuse to engage with big lefty creators and instead harass small ones

101
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,760
for somebody who is all about the removal of hierarchy you're really depending on it here

102
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
aren't you let me make it absolutely clear in a way that I think you can appreciate Kerry there

103
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,080
is no difference between the two of us we're all human the only thing that's different is how we

104
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,640
think I think that you made this strike not truly knowing what the DMCA is for which is why by the

105
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,520
way youtube has taken my side and reinstated the video from a legal perspective I didn't

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,360
need your permission to re-upload my appearance on your stream because it is my appearance but

107
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
I can also understand the stages of thought that you went through on the 24th you invited me to be

108
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,880
there you were very happy that I was you were excited on the 25th you spent a significant

109
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,240
amount of time insulting me stating that you had no idea why I was there and talking about how

110
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,480
happy that you were that I gave you exposure and then on the 28th you abused youtube's DMCA

111
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,320
takedown notices to remove that very same source of exposure that three days earlier you were very

112
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,480
happy about so I kind of get it you went through the various stages you weren't necessarily

113
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,560
prepared even though I wasn't either but I understand I understand your position entirely

114
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,160
so even though I do not necessarily expect you to actually reply to this I will leave this on

115
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,040
the table and you can take me up on it anytime you like I understand being nervous I understand

116
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,400
feeling attacked even if you weren't actually attacked I understand feeling that way so for me

117
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,480
Kerry this is all water under the bridge if you ever want to continue our conversation you can

118
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,520
drop into my discord I'll stream it and I promise you I won't kick you out I won't mute you and we

119
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,560
can take as much time as you like getting to the bottom of some of these issues if for some reason

120
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,160
you'd rather not stream it and you'd rather us pre-record it I can do that too like I said I'm

121
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,400
not a debate bro because if you really watch that video in good faith I think we agreed more than we

122
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,960
disagree on a lot of things in any case Kerry the ball's in your court you don't have to take me up

123
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,600
on it in fact if you simply decided to shit talk me on twitter for another couple days and then

124
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,360
ignore that I ever existed fine I wouldn't take it personally and as always my friends please don't

125
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
go and harass this person all right this is not about the egos involved it truly is about the

126
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,000
issues all right I'll talk to you guys next time I love you
