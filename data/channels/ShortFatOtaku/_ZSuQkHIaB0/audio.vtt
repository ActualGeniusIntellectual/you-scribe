00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
This video is primarily a message to Carrie from the um the KezBox channel who may end up locking

00:07.680 --> 00:11.440
her twitter account as a result of this video because the last time I talked about her she did

00:11.440 --> 00:15.680
the same thing but I just want to let you know beforehand you don't have to do that however if

00:15.680 --> 00:21.120
you're just a regular viewer of mine watching this video let me give you the backstory and most

00:21.120 --> 00:26.720
importantly of all uh please don't contact this person all right so here's the back end of my

00:26.720 --> 00:32.400
channel there's the JK Rowling video the cancel crowd share video I hope you enjoyed that uh

00:32.400 --> 00:39.920
that pun the Qtees video 9 11 am I a fascist that was a fun one uh but I'll just scroll down

00:39.920 --> 00:48.960
check it out oh the uh the KezBox debate is back see it's no longer everyone can see this video

00:49.920 --> 00:52.880
now it's not blocked or anything you can go to it

00:53.200 --> 01:06.880
and as you can see it is available again now some of you may may remember this video was gone for a

01:06.880 --> 01:12.080
while I mean it's three or four weeks old but it's back now so if you want to go watch it you

01:12.080 --> 01:21.200
can go watch it if you like what this video is is I went on this person's um stream at their at

01:21.200 --> 01:26.960
their request and just had a friendly chat with them at least I I thought it was a friendly chat

01:26.960 --> 01:33.440
until after an hour and 12 minutes she kicked me off which is her right it's her stream

01:34.000 --> 01:37.280
she doesn't need to talk to anybody that she doesn't want to talk to now I have a kind of

01:37.280 --> 01:43.840
specific problem with myself I'm kind of anal about some things I like the work that I do to um

01:43.840 --> 01:47.680
to not disappear I like watching old spoonie videos but the problem with spoonie is that

01:47.680 --> 01:52.240
half of his catalog had disappeared since a lot of them were on blip tv so I have to go to like

01:52.240 --> 01:58.240
five different spoonie fan channels on youtube that have like various commentaries and vlogs

01:58.240 --> 02:03.280
and reviews that have since been lost the time and even though I know that I'm a small youtuber

02:03.280 --> 02:10.160
I have always wanted some kind of canonical consistency with my work so even though this

02:10.160 --> 02:15.360
channel is no longer about the old anime reviews from 2009 those still exist on a side channel

02:15.360 --> 02:19.840
even though game boomers get significantly more traction on twitch than on youtube

02:19.840 --> 02:24.960
I still upload all of the streams to the game boomers youtube channel even though there's

02:24.960 --> 02:29.280
not really that many viewers of them but I just like things to be around I don't like the idea

02:29.280 --> 02:35.200
of having content that is lost to time that kind of bothers me it bothers me when creators that

02:35.200 --> 02:39.440
I watch do it so just in case there's somebody out there who actually cares about me I don't

02:39.440 --> 02:43.920
want to do it to them so I like to archive everything that I do it's just a quirk of my

02:43.920 --> 02:50.480
personality so I figured after this conversation with carrie I would simply put the video up on my

02:50.480 --> 02:55.600
youtube channel so that it wouldn't get lost however she didn't like that she filed a copyright

02:55.600 --> 03:01.600
strike on my channel on august 28th four days after I put the video up and I think five days

03:01.600 --> 03:08.000
after the actual debate took place her reasoning was he's literally recorded and uploaded a chunk

03:08.000 --> 03:14.240
of my live stream without my permission which I wouldn't have given I didn't even say I'd be in

03:14.240 --> 03:20.240
a video of his well that's correct it was my recording of the live stream because it was a

03:20.240 --> 03:24.640
conversation that both of us had and even though she filed a copyright strike to get the video

03:24.640 --> 03:30.320
taken down it is my belief that that strike was likely incorrect this is from the university of

03:30.320 --> 03:37.200
stanford's fair use page who owns the copyright in a joint work when two or more authors prepare

03:37.200 --> 03:41.840
a work with the intent to combine their contributions into inseparable or interdependent

03:41.840 --> 03:48.160
parts the work is considered joint work and the authors are considered joint copyright owners the

03:48.160 --> 03:53.520
most common example of a joint work is when a book or article has two or more authors now I didn't

03:53.520 --> 03:59.440
upload her entire stream nor would I have I didn't even upload the part after she kicked me out of it

03:59.440 --> 04:04.960
where she spent some time discussing with her friends exactly what she thought of me I only

04:04.960 --> 04:10.640
uploaded my contribution it just so happens that my contribution was in some way inseparable with

04:10.640 --> 04:16.720
hers now it's not like she didn't want to make this combined work in fact she invited me on

04:16.720 --> 04:20.800
the stream herself I mean you can hop on discord if you want that's not a problem

04:23.200 --> 04:27.680
there you go you can hop off on discord if it'll be easier and she also tweeted about it short

04:27.680 --> 04:33.360
photo talk was in my chat talking about the sargon video youtuber and sargon friend mentioned in

04:33.360 --> 04:39.360
carl gone's new video as having a back and forth with shoe is in my fucking chat right the fuck now

04:40.000 --> 04:45.680
she seemed quite excited at the prospect at least at the time this person here says if sargon of a

04:45.680 --> 04:50.160
cat I don't think that's a real twitter account dude can't seem to understand the idea of socialist

04:50.160 --> 04:56.240
democrats why doesn't he just talk to the surf's tv and then carrie says or me so she wants to talk

04:56.240 --> 05:02.000
to sargon now the way his friend friend is in quotes do you not believe that sargon and I are

05:02.000 --> 05:07.440
friends and defender stand tried to it just got boring considering he was unable to actually

05:07.440 --> 05:12.720
answer a question well if you actually go back and watch our discussion there are multiple times

05:12.720 --> 05:17.760
where carrie said something along the lines of I see what you're saying or I understand or that's

05:17.760 --> 05:24.160
not a bad take she says imagine being so pathetic that you basically stalk and try to bully a small

05:24.160 --> 05:30.240
streamer hilarious do these twats realize that it often makes us more popular well if it makes you

05:30.240 --> 05:36.560
more popular why would you file a false copyright strike to get the video taken down surely you

05:36.560 --> 05:41.600
would want the publicity and no I've never had any intention of bullying you or anybody else that

05:41.600 --> 05:47.280
I've talked to I mean I've made some serious mistakes especially recently we don't have to

05:47.280 --> 05:53.840
re-go over those I don't think but the point is I don't view size as being part of the discussion

05:53.840 --> 05:57.520
I will talk to somebody who is much bigger than me I will talk to somebody who is much smaller

05:57.520 --> 06:03.680
than me we are all fundamentally the same we're equal I figured that as somebody who prioritizes

06:04.400 --> 06:09.600
the virtue of equality you would kind of appreciate that position it doesn't matter to

06:09.600 --> 06:15.040
you if you have 200 subs or 2 million subs as long as you're willing to talk in good faith that's

06:15.040 --> 06:20.480
fine with me I'm not out here trying to own anybody I just want to have decent discussions

06:20.480 --> 06:26.320
maybe come to some sort of understanding that's all and it's not stalking to talk about you if

06:26.320 --> 06:30.800
you're a public figure it's not stalking when you invite me on your own stream and then we have a

06:30.800 --> 06:36.640
conversation that I guess you didn't like how it went and it's certainly not stalking to reply to

06:36.640 --> 06:42.880
a false DMCA takedown so after that reactionary youtuber hopped into my chat SFO it wouldn't

06:42.880 --> 06:48.080
surprise me if he ended up trying to own me for content in his next youtube video because I yeeted

06:48.080 --> 06:53.440
him after an hour of him not answering questions and talking in pointless circles well we actually

06:53.440 --> 06:57.600
covered multiple different topics of conversation we didn't go in circles we actually like

06:57.600 --> 07:01.360
went through multiple full topics and kind of argued them to their conclusion because

07:01.920 --> 07:05.520
I thought we were having a good faith discussion there were multiple times where I straight up

07:05.520 --> 07:10.640
agreed with you and I still do and no this video is not the own that you're looking for

07:11.440 --> 07:17.600
like I said I'm not here to blow you out so after deciding to harass a small twitch streamer who

07:17.600 --> 07:22.880
wasn't even prepared for the conversation short fat otaku decided to upload it the comment section

07:22.880 --> 07:28.560
is wild again you invited me on I didn't say anything harassing towards you and neither of

07:28.560 --> 07:33.120
us were prepared for the conversation I was literally surfing through random channels on

07:33.120 --> 07:39.920
twitch I saw the name Sargon in your twitch title and I checked you out that was it literally your

07:39.920 --> 07:44.480
own SEO brought me to your stream which was basically the point to attract new viewers

07:44.480 --> 07:48.320
wasn't it the commenter here says who wasn't prepared how did this conversation get arranged

07:48.400 --> 07:53.120
and Carrie says I wasn't and it didn't well I wasn't prepared either I didn't really have

07:53.120 --> 07:57.040
any sort like I had one source because I had used it earlier that day and something else but

07:57.040 --> 08:01.360
I didn't have sources to back up what I was talking about I had to look up um the Vancouver

08:01.360 --> 08:06.800
housing crisis because I had no sources and it got arranged by you inviting me on imagine having

08:06.800 --> 08:12.880
almost 100k subs on youtube and deciding to spend your time debating extremely tiny twitch streamers

08:12.880 --> 08:18.480
rather than you know vosh well regardless of my own problems with debating vosh at this point I

08:18.480 --> 08:23.200
don't think vosh would actually do it and only for the reason because he's more than double my size

08:23.200 --> 08:28.000
now he already said that he doesn't want to make somebody else's career he's kind of thinking in

08:28.000 --> 08:32.480
the same terms that uh Styx Hexenhammer was thinking and when vosh challenged him to a debate

08:32.480 --> 08:36.800
so I actually don't think that vosh would talk to me but let's keep reading he acts like he's the

08:36.800 --> 08:41.200
big man here but refuses to engage in debate with people his own size and with significant debate

08:41.200 --> 08:47.200
experience well one I have no significant debate experience again another reason why I wouldn't

08:47.200 --> 08:51.840
debate vosh because I'm not a debate bro but secondly like I said I consider all of us to be

08:51.840 --> 08:57.360
equal it doesn't matter who has more or less subs it doesn't matter who you are what matters are the

08:57.360 --> 09:01.920
ideas of course Kerry says he also doesn't seem to realize that this sort of shit brings us more

09:01.920 --> 09:06.960
viewers well again why did you copyright strike the video SFO is a reactionary who know that

09:06.960 --> 09:11.120
they're garbage they refuse to engage with big lefty creators and instead harass small ones

09:11.120 --> 09:15.760
for somebody who is all about the removal of hierarchy you're really depending on it here

09:15.760 --> 09:19.600
aren't you let me make it absolutely clear in a way that I think you can appreciate Kerry there

09:19.600 --> 09:24.080
is no difference between the two of us we're all human the only thing that's different is how we

09:24.080 --> 09:30.640
think I think that you made this strike not truly knowing what the DMCA is for which is why by the

09:30.640 --> 09:35.520
way youtube has taken my side and reinstated the video from a legal perspective I didn't

09:35.520 --> 09:41.360
need your permission to re-upload my appearance on your stream because it is my appearance but

09:41.360 --> 09:46.160
I can also understand the stages of thought that you went through on the 24th you invited me to be

09:46.160 --> 09:50.880
there you were very happy that I was you were excited on the 25th you spent a significant

09:50.880 --> 09:56.240
amount of time insulting me stating that you had no idea why I was there and talking about how

09:56.240 --> 10:02.480
happy that you were that I gave you exposure and then on the 28th you abused youtube's DMCA

10:02.480 --> 10:08.320
takedown notices to remove that very same source of exposure that three days earlier you were very

10:08.320 --> 10:12.480
happy about so I kind of get it you went through the various stages you weren't necessarily

10:12.480 --> 10:16.560
prepared even though I wasn't either but I understand I understand your position entirely

10:16.560 --> 10:22.160
so even though I do not necessarily expect you to actually reply to this I will leave this on

10:22.160 --> 10:27.040
the table and you can take me up on it anytime you like I understand being nervous I understand

10:27.040 --> 10:32.400
feeling attacked even if you weren't actually attacked I understand feeling that way so for me

10:32.400 --> 10:38.480
Kerry this is all water under the bridge if you ever want to continue our conversation you can

10:38.480 --> 10:45.520
drop into my discord I'll stream it and I promise you I won't kick you out I won't mute you and we

10:45.520 --> 10:50.560
can take as much time as you like getting to the bottom of some of these issues if for some reason

10:50.560 --> 10:56.160
you'd rather not stream it and you'd rather us pre-record it I can do that too like I said I'm

10:56.160 --> 11:00.400
not a debate bro because if you really watch that video in good faith I think we agreed more than we

11:00.400 --> 11:04.960
disagree on a lot of things in any case Kerry the ball's in your court you don't have to take me up

11:04.960 --> 11:09.600
on it in fact if you simply decided to shit talk me on twitter for another couple days and then

11:09.600 --> 11:15.360
ignore that I ever existed fine I wouldn't take it personally and as always my friends please don't

11:15.360 --> 11:19.680
go and harass this person all right this is not about the egos involved it truly is about the

11:19.680 --> 11:24.000
issues all right I'll talk to you guys next time I love you
