0	9840	I made a video a couple years ago called, What is a Reactionary?, examining the meaning
9840	10840	of the word.
10840	13800	The political meaning, not the general one, which is literally just somebody who reacts
13800	14800	to stuff.
14800	19000	The description of that video reads, Revolution seems to be a privilege only afforded to the
19000	23280	left, but the reality is, progress does not simply go in one political direction.
23280	26540	I was on the right track, but there were still a few things I didn't understand.
26540	30860	To begin with, the political definition of reactionary is, a person or a set of views
30860	35700	opposing political or social liberalization or reform, or alternatively, a person who
35700	39640	holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante, the previous political
39640	44080	state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent
44080	45480	from contemporary society.
45480	47820	An easy joke to make, uses the first definition of the word.
47820	51820	Since that definition points toward political or social liberalization, moving away from
51820	56660	liberalism or being somehow anti-liberal means that you're a reactionary, which makes
56660	58060	socialist reactionary.
58060	63060	Sock Dunn Left had his jimmies rustled when I trolled Twitter with this joke, but it is
63060	64780	just a joke, not a real criticism.
64780	67740	The more serious definition of reactionary is that second one.
67740	72660	It's what breadtubers use to label the Nazbols, the national Bolsheviks of Russia, as simultaneously
72660	74920	both reactionary and on the left.
74920	77940	At least, the more honest ones admit that they're on the left, just a part of the left
77940	78940	that they don't like.
78940	81500	The slimier ones try to pretend that the Nazbols are right wing.
81500	97220	By the way, the national Bolsheviks are a faction within Russia that want to see a return
97220	101540	to the Soviet Union's political and economic systems, they're simultaneously authoritarian
101540	105500	leftist on the political compass, and reactionary in that they favor a return to a previous
105500	106500	status quo.
106500	109380	I've been called reactionary quite a bit myself.
109380	112120	Most recently by this person Natalie on Twitter.
112120	115420	She is doing so in a thread where I ratioed her and it actually got under her skin a little
115420	116420	bit.
116420	117420	Listen, I'm not keffles.
117420	118620	I don't care whether or not I ratio people.
118620	122080	I don't view my personal worth as being made up of likes on social media.
122080	124420	But let's examine this idea that I'm a reactionary YouTuber.
124420	127620	I'm not taking it as an insult, but I do want to consider the label.
127620	130300	What previous state of society do I want to return to?
130300	134380	And in that state, are there actually values found there that we're currently lacking?
134380	136660	I think there's an easy answer to those questions.
136660	140740	In terms of freedom of expression, we were significantly more free, at least culturally,
140740	142440	20 years ago than we are now.
142440	145780	And by some very loose definition, that does make me a reactionary.
145780	148500	But we're not simply doing the what is a reactionary video again.
148500	149660	That's not the title of this video.
149660	152120	We're talking about something that is related but different.
152120	153800	And let me show you what inspired it.
153800	157660	A while ago, there was a bit of drama where I made a video about the alt-right pipeline.
157660	159120	And then Xanderhal responded to it.
159120	161180	And then I responded to that on Adam and Sitch.
161180	163080	And then Xanderhal said he'd come on the stream and then he didn't.
163080	167120	And then Xanderhal ducked a future talk with me and also ducked one with Sargon, leaving
167120	169160	Chud Logic wondering what was going on.
169160	170720	Yeah, this whole thing was like a month ago.
170720	175080	I was inspired to do this video back then and I just sat on the idea, sorry.
175080	179000	During that Adam and Sitch stream, in Xanderhal's comment section, there was one message that
179000	182740	briefly caught my eye, but there was no real way to talk about it in the moment.
182740	183740	And here it is.
183740	187800	I find it kind of funny how right wingers always say the left used to be X, but now
187800	188800	it's too far.
188800	191100	Like, bro, that's the point of progressivism.
191100	192100	That we progress.
192100	194340	We don't just sit at one place politically.
194340	199300	300 years ago, totally abolishing the monarchy in favor of a liberal democracy was far left
199300	201020	and crazy, but time moved on.
201020	205960	As things change and we learn and experience and as a society we move forward and progress.
205960	209200	In other words, to progress means always to move leftward.
209200	212720	In this guy's point of view, the shifting of the overton window leftward over time is
212720	218140	not only expected, not only required, but it is indeed a natural process of history.
218140	219380	It's just how it is.
219380	223700	Pressing not only means moving leftward over time, it means that it is the proper state
223700	228780	of history to move leftward, that history itself has an animating force pushing society
228780	229780	left.
229780	232060	If you think I'm exaggerating here, it's not hard to find a breadtuber who will parrot
232060	233300	this exact sentiment.
233300	238580	It objectively is the case, I mean, by any standard whatsoever.
238580	244820	Historically as you move linearly in time forward, political opinions move left.
244820	247380	That's not an argument.
247380	254020	Like literally it's progress, it's just how it works, it's just how humans operate.
254020	256780	What are you talking about?
256780	257780	Literally yes.
257780	259860	It always moves left.
259860	263320	It's also not hard to find a breadtuber who will point out, just like that commenter,
263320	267900	that a progressive who fails to progress with the times will eventually become a reactionary.
267900	272900	You motherfuckers larp as progressives until progressivism or the idea of challenging social
272900	275420	norms suddenly overlaps with the norm that you like.
275420	279520	I fucking hate it when people like you act like that, it's so fucking frustrating.
279520	282480	Progressivism isn't just about being pro-gay or whatever the fuck else, okay?
282480	287420	It's about a fundamental, unconditional willingness to challenge social norms, or at the very
287420	291260	least to be understanding of the ways in which those social norms are formed and the influences
291260	293820	those can have socially.
293820	295060	That's progressivism.
295060	298500	Because if you're just progressive, because you're like pro-gay or pro-trans or whatever,
298500	300540	you're gonna be the next reactionary.
300540	304900	It's not enough to just be pro whatever social shit people are for these days.
305380	312740	You need to have a general awareness of how all these reactionary takes are beget by the
312740	315400	normalization of social values.
315400	320240	So in the minds of these people, the neutral position isn't actually remaining still.
320240	323500	Neutrality is drifting leftward slowly over time.
323500	326420	Progressivism is actively moving leftward quickly over time.
326420	330020	And if you do remain at a standstill, you are automatically shifting right.
330020	334000	Because it's not you that's actually moving, but the political landscape itself, shifting
334000	335160	beneath your feet.
335160	338980	Some might even say that people don't actually become more conservative as they age, rather
338980	342920	their culture becomes more progressive over time, and their old progressive opinions become
342920	344520	conservative ones as they get older.
344520	348260	This is the source of those right-wing memes that show conservatives of the future arguing
348260	349860	for progressive policies of today.
349860	354060	And this is why I talked about being a reactionary at the start of the video, because Vosch correctly
354060	359040	pointed out that, in the minds of many progressives, there are only two camps, them and reactionaries.
359040	360760	And the more left you are, the more progressive you are.
360760	362520	The more right you are, the more reactionary you are.
362520	366160	So a person who is extremely progressive is going to be viewed as a reactionary by somebody
366160	369120	who is just even a little bit further left than them.
369120	374280	This entire interpretation rests on the assumption that progress and reaction are two forces
374280	378820	that always oppose, and that to make gains in one necessarily must mean that you lose
378820	379820	in the other.
379820	382680	But I think that we can show that this is not exactly true.
382680	387240	So many people on the left are desperately trying to redefine the Nazbols as right-wing,
387240	390880	or other reactionary left elements like TERFs for example, even though they're clearly
390880	391920	on the left.
391920	395380	Because these are groups that are simultaneously progressive and reactionary.
395380	399240	They want a return to a previous status quo, because they believe that that previous status
399240	402600	quo represented more progress than what we're currently living in.
402600	406000	Consider this, whenever a right-wing candidate wins an election, or a piece of left-wing
406000	410840	policy falls apart, normies on social media will often post Star Trek memes.
410840	414320	Star Trek is the progressive utopia in pop fiction, and these memes are often accompanied
414320	417760	with stuff like, I thought we were moving forward, or this is the future that Democrats
417760	418760	want.
418760	422580	You see this as being a unidirectional path, an arrow that points at the bright shining
422580	426720	utopian city on the hill where all of humanity's problems are solved, and the only possible
426720	429560	way you could disagree with them is if you were stupid or evil.
429560	432360	It couldn't be because they're wrong, because they want what's good.
432360	434040	They're for progress after all.
434040	437440	Meanwhile somebody like a Nazbol is much more likely to view the future like it looks and
437440	438440	followed.
438440	441480	If you were living in a post-apocalyptic tribalistic nuclear wasteland, you would be a reasonable
441480	446520	person to long for a return to that old civilization, that old status quo of prosperity, even if
446520	448400	it's reactionary to do so.
448400	450640	Because the future isn't actually that good in that case.
450640	454960	We don't even need to use these extreme detached from reality examples either.
454960	459840	Is it progress that in Democrat controlled cities we see spiking drug use and urban decay?
459840	463440	Is it reactionary to prefer a time in the past where there was more social cohesion?
463440	467760	In other words, progressives view the nature of progress as being something like a technology
467760	469340	tree in a game of civilization.
469340	472760	You level up your progress, the new thing eventually becomes outdated, and those who
472760	476200	cling to it become reactionary in the process, and progress marches on.
476200	478920	There's only one way to go, and that is up.
478920	482540	But in reality, there's actually a lot wrong with this conception of progress.
482540	484440	For example, take the classical fascists.
484440	489240	The socialists of today use reactionary to refer to fascism, or fascist adjacent.
489240	493240	They have no problem calling people fascist for no reason, but if their target is such
493240	496480	that it's too much of a reach even for them, they'll say reactionary instead.
496480	500800	I've heard people like It's a Gundam or Turkey Tom be called reactionary because they
500800	503380	make videos laughing at dumb fucks on social media.
503380	505200	And yeah, they're literally reacting, but that's not the point.
505200	508640	The point is that they're laughing at the silly things people do in the name of progress,
508640	513260	which itself is a step towards suppressing progress by making people feel embarrassed
513260	514880	for doing things that are progressive.
514880	517960	So if you're making fun of something that's progressive, you're reactionary.
517960	522080	Obviously, though, iconoclasts and comedians who laugh at everything, including laughing
522080	525320	at the left, are not fascists, but progressives treat them like they are because if you're
525320	529380	not progressing properly, you're a reactionary, and they view fascism as the natural end result
529380	530960	of reactionary tendencies.
530960	534700	That's why capitalism decays into fascism in their view, because progression is abandoning
534700	539480	capitalism for socialism, or why liberalism props up fascism, because progression is overthrowing
539480	540740	liberalism with socialism.
540740	541740	It's all the same logic.
541740	544340	Either you're a progressive socialist, or you're a reactionary fascist.
544340	548420	If you claim to be neither, you automatically assist the reaction against revolution.
548420	554620	It's very George Bush in a way.
554620	557260	The problem with this view is that it's not true.
557260	560940	Joseph de Maistre was the first reactionary, and the first one to really write about the
560940	562380	philosophy of reaction.
562380	566200	In the context of the French Revolution, de Maistre critiqued the Enlightenment as a destabilizing
566200	570540	social force, that a monarchy ordained by God was the only form of government that had
570540	574780	political legitimacy, and that the only way to cultivate social cohesion was through strict
574780	576380	authority and hierarchy.
576380	580580	His writing created the philosophical basis for modern European traditional conservatism,
580580	583400	contrasting that with Edmund Burke's English liberal conservatism.
583400	588660	In The Doctrine of Fascism, Mussolini writes at length about reactionaryism and de Maistre.
588660	593820	The fascist negation of socialism, democracy, and liberalism should not, however, be interpreted
593820	599380	as implying a desire to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789, a year
599380	603220	commonly referred to as that which opened the demo-liberal century.
603220	604620	History does not travel backwards.
604620	608460	The fascist doctrine has not taken de Maistre as its prophet.
608460	610460	Monarchical absolutism is of the past.
610460	615420	Dead and done are feudal privileges and the division of society into closed, uncommunicating
615420	616420	castes.
616420	618980	The state is, however, a unique and original creation.
618980	623640	It is not reactionary but revolutionary, for it anticipates the solution of certain universal
623640	625780	problems which have been raised elsewhere.
625780	629700	Fascism has outgrown the dilemma, monarchy versus republic, over which democratic regimes
629700	633900	too long dallied, attributing all insufficiencies to the former and proning the latter as a
633900	635140	regime of perfection.
635140	639740	Whereas experience teaches that some republics are inherently reactionary and absolutist,
639740	643300	while some monarchies accept the most daring political and social experiments.
643300	645660	Look at the language used in these passages.
645660	649180	The classical fascists viewed themselves not as reactionary but revolutionary.
649180	652820	They viewed themselves as the solution to the capitalist versus socialist problem.
652820	657060	In Hegelian terms, they viewed themselves as the synthesis to the thesis of capitalism
657060	658780	and the antithesis of socialism.
658780	662540	If you're a leftist watching this video, I already know what you're saying to yourself
662540	663540	in your head.
663540	666760	The fascists lied about everything, they just wanted to get people on their side.
666760	671100	But no government commonly called a fascist ever actually instituted a true return to
671100	672100	the past.
672100	675940	The Nazis did not rebuild any of the old German empires or call Kaiser Wilhelm back to the
675940	677620	throne from exile in the Netherlands.
677620	680180	In fact, the Nazis hated the old German institutions.
680180	684540	Mussolini viewed Italy's Catholicism not as a part of its conservative indigenous culture
684540	687640	to be protected, but as a barrier hindering his consolidation of power.
687640	692340	Japan had no desire to return to a pre-Miji restoration feudalistic era.
692340	696620	Spain never had any desire to return to its old imperial ways, instead transitioning towards
696620	700340	autarky, an economic move that is characteristically un-Spanish.
700340	704220	The behaviors of these governments may not be revolutionary in the specific ways that
704220	708140	terminally online socialists would prefer, but they clearly weren't seeking a return
708140	710060	to a past state of politics.
710060	714980	This isn't just my analysis either, utopian fascism is a topic that's been studied extensively.
714980	718520	Utopia in the political sense is the end state of progress, the final goal.
718520	722140	When all progressing has been done, when all possible improvements have been made, when
722140	726300	every project has reached its culmination, human society achieves its perfection.
726300	730100	And the fascists, rather than grasping for the imperfection of the past, had their own
730100	734980	conception of utopia, separate from the leftist view of the stateless, moneyless, classless
734980	735980	communism.
735980	740340	The term reactionary modernism was coined by historians to try and explain this great
740340	744700	contradiction within fascism, where they had a great admiration for the concept of progress,
744700	747140	but they nonetheless rejected the socialist vision of it.
747140	751060	The reason this appears to be a contradiction is because of the a priori assumption that
751060	753620	the socialist vision of progress is the correct one.
753620	756060	Again, it's the skill tree that only fills one way.
756100	760340	It's the Star Trek thinking, having a vision of the future that only exists in theory inside
760340	763140	your head, and then every move towards it is progress.
763140	766920	Every move away from it is regress, regardless of the actual cause and effect of the moves
766920	767920	in reality.
767920	771480	If you already have a mental structure in your head that says feudalism to capitalism
771480	775180	to socialism to communism, all traveling along a conveyor belt, anything that doesn't fit
775180	778140	into that move has to instead be pushing backwards.
778140	783140	Like I said earlier, the fascists viewed themselves, not communism, as the stage beyond socialism.
783220	786540	Again, the socialist reply to this is to scream that the fascists are lying.
786540	788660	The socialist says, fascists lie.
788660	792240	You cannot trust anything they say or write, they're subversive, they will do anything
792240	793240	to gain power.
793240	796440	Putting aside for the moment, that sounds like nearly every single socialist online
796440	800620	right now, it's also an anti-intellectual position to deliberately avoid an entire wing
800620	803460	of knowledge simply because it comes from people you don't like.
803460	807820	Dr. David Roberts, history professor at the University of Georgia writes in his book,
807820	811880	Fascist Interactions, that the greatest advance in fascist studies over the last 40 years
811880	815800	has come precisely from taking the fascist self-understanding seriously.
815800	820080	By now it is widely held that fascism was not some revolt against modernity, but the
820080	822000	quest for an alternative modernity.
822000	825800	This would imply that it was not merely an effort to catch up to the modern democracies
825800	827880	through different, more extreme means.
827880	832160	And rather than merely counter-revolutionary or reactionary, fascism was in some sense
832160	834040	revolutionary in its own right.
834040	837080	Fascism may not be the type of revolutionary that your average online socialist likes,
837080	838560	but it is revolutionary nonetheless.
838560	841720	They viewed themselves as progressing, even if you might not.
841720	846840	This view of progress as an ongoing unidirectionary method is called Whig Histiography.
846840	849680	The Whigs were a British liberal movement before liberalism was a thing.
849680	852480	What they were all about isn't too important right now, but they had a view of history
852480	856520	as being a journey where humanity travels from an oppressive, cruel past into a glorious
856520	857540	advanced future.
857540	862160	They believe the ultimate culmination of Whig Histiography was liberal democracy and constitutional
862160	863160	monarchy.
863160	866960	The phrase Whig Histiography was originally coined as a satirical term, but was eventually
866960	869200	adopted by the Whigs and later the liberals in the UK.
869200	873000	The idea is that history has a goal that it actively moves towards, rather than simply
873000	874000	existing.
874000	876120	This is where you get the phrase, the end of history.
876120	879520	Socialism is built atop of the concept of Whig Histiography, that history has a goal
879520	883240	it actively moves towards, but they disagree that the end stage is liberal democracy.
883240	886320	Marx's view, being a revision of the Whigist view, considered socialism to be the next
886320	887320	stage after liberalism.
887320	890400	Mussolini's view, being a revision of the Marxist view, considered fascism to be the
890400	891400	next stage after socialism.
891400	892480	It doesn't stop there.
892480	897080	For example, Alexander Duggan, stylized as Putin's philosopher, much like Gentile was
897080	901160	Mussolini's, and the creator of the national Bolshevik ideology, wrote his own book on
901160	903280	this topic, the fourth political theory.
903280	908080	He views his ideas as the next step beyond fascism, like Mussolini saw fascism being
908080	911360	beyond socialism, and Marx saw socialism being beyond liberalism.
911360	915140	His theory, the fourth theory, therefore is progress beyond those big three, at least
915140	916140	according to him.
916140	919520	This end of history, march of progress rhetoric, is appealing to many people that the left
919520	924920	would call reactionary, even though reactionaryism explicitly rejects the march of progress.
924920	927680	Rather than searching for alternative modes of progress like the fascists do.
927680	929920	And this is where we come to the core of the issue.
929920	932000	Fascists are not reactionaries.
932000	935280	Fascists still worship the concept of progress in the same way that progressives and socialists
935280	937480	do, they just have a different meaning of progress.
937480	942020	Actual reactionaries reject the very concept of progress itself, and in doing so they simultaneously
942020	944040	reject socialism and fascism.
944040	947840	It is this distinction between a fascist and a reactionary that I don't think anybody on
947840	952040	the online left understands right now, and I think that's why they have a hard time quantifying
952040	955640	right wing politics beyond simply saying the right is bad and then getting upvotes
955640	956640	online.
956640	960200	Julius Evola was a philosopher in fascist Italy, and he is considered a fascist by many,
960200	962200	but he called himself a super-fascist.
962200	966040	What he meant by that was he considered the classical fascist as not being fascist enough
966040	971480	for his tastes, and his writing would ultimately discard classical fascism for not being reactionary.
971480	975800	Evola's most famous work, Revolt Against the Modern World, is explicitly anti-modern
975800	978760	in all of its forms, liberal, socialist, and fascist.
978760	983040	The neo-reactionary movement, otherwise known as the Dark Enlightenment, are, true to their
983040	984400	name, explicitly reactionary.
984400	988240	Evola is one of their bedrocks, along with anarcho-capitalists like Hoppe, and modern
988240	989880	figures like Mentious Moldbug.
989880	993020	Rather than seeking an alternative progress like the fascists do, rather than declaring
993020	997440	themselves the next stage in the march of history, they reject Whig histography altogether.
997440	1001720	They advocate not for a fascist government, but an actual return to older forms of government,
1001720	1003520	like absolute monarchy or Cameralism.
1003520	1007240	These people aren't fascists, they're actually reactionaries, they're not futurists
1007240	1008240	the way the fascists were.
1008240	1011440	They reject progress as a virtue, rather than arguing over what constitutes the next
1011440	1012440	stage of it.
1012440	1016040	And when socialists call everyone who's not them reactionary or fascists, they just
1016040	1017560	don't understand the words they're using.
1017560	1021400	When people out there call It's a Gundam or Turkey Tom or myself reactionary YouTubers,
1021400	1022960	they have no clue what they're talking about.
1022960	1026640	We may not agree with your conception of progress, or the fascist one for that matter, but that
1026640	1030280	doesn't mean that we reject progress entirely, we have our own idea of what it is.
1030280	1033440	We don't want to return to a previous political paradigm, a priori.
1033440	1037160	We may want to see the restoration of virtues lost to the past, not because it's in the
1037160	1039880	past, but because we view society as having regressed.
1039880	1043000	It's the difference between looking at a past era and wanting it because it represents
1043000	1046880	going back and the concept of progress as bad, that's the reactionary view, and looking
1046880	1051280	at a past era and wanting it returned because it actually represents real progress, and
1051280	1053840	the path that we've gone down is fake progress.
1053840	1054840	And that is where I am.
1054840	1058960	I'm not a reactionary, I don't value regression, but I don't believe that what the socialists
1058960	1063320	or the fascists call progressive actually contains any real progress at all.
1063320	1066760	They're all just different flavors of failure, distinct from each other, but nothing I'm
1066760	1067760	interested in.
1067760	1071160	I mentioned the Hegelian method earlier, and that's partially because Hegel's view of history
1071160	1073640	is the ultimate end of the concept of progress.
1073640	1076880	Whether it's socialist or fascist or either type of ist, Hegel's view is that the march
1076880	1081500	of progress, and history automatically engaging in that march, a view called historicism,
1081500	1084780	has its natural end in the authoritarian, bureaucratic state.
1084780	1087560	This would later be coined as totalitarian by the fascists.
1087560	1090080	But the socialists would also embrace this concept.
1090080	1093760	Where Mussolini would say, all within the state, the socialists would say everything
1093760	1094760	is political.
1094760	1096900	The same concept, two sides of the same coin.
1096900	1100840	A utopia in its perfection would have to be totalitarian, because perfection means perfection
1100840	1101840	in all places.
1101840	1104400	That's why they always say a real socialist has never been tried, because it has to be
1104400	1108280	everywhere, so that the imperfection of other locations cannot simply upend the construction.
1108280	1112520	A utopia in its perfection would have to be bureaucratic, because if, as Mussolini said,
1112520	1115040	everything is within the state, everything needs to be controlled and managed.
1115040	1118780	A utopia in its perfection would have to be authoritarian, because if you've already got
1118780	1123260	everything perfectly correct, there is no need to tolerate any more dissent, or debate,
1123260	1125140	or people leaving and going their own way.
1125140	1128500	All utopianism, regardless of political slant, is totalitarian.
1128500	1132580	And all political movements that believe in the march of progress, in this historicism,
1132580	1135380	that history has a teleology, is ultimately utopian.
1135380	1139420	The neo-reactionaries might reject this whole process, but I think they throw the baby out
1139420	1140420	with the bathwater.
1140420	1142940	For all of the ills of modernity, it's brought with it a lot of good.
1142940	1145460	So the question is, what's the solution to this problem?
1145460	1149240	Max Weber was a German historian and economist, founder of the field that would later be known
1149240	1153880	as sociology, and the inventor of the concept of methodological individualism, the idea
1153880	1157980	that individual motivations explain social phenomena, and that class dynamics are ultimately
1157980	1159200	just illusions.
1159200	1163620	This idea was accepted by neoclassical economists, Austrian economists, I think pretty much every
1163620	1167000	economic school other than the socialists, but it's not a purely economic idea.
1167000	1170400	Weber's interest was in the intersection of economics and history, and he is known for
1170400	1174660	saying, history consists of individual relations and events, and it is not the job of those
1174660	1179080	who study history to develop from it a social science or ideology to guide our way.
1179080	1183080	I think my view of progress is more in line with Weber's idea.
1183080	1184420	There is no end of history.
1184420	1188840	There is no destiny that human society must pursue at all costs, or resist at all costs,
1188840	1190040	as the reactionaries would have it.
1190040	1192040	There is no utopia that we can build.
1192040	1195800	History does not naturally trend leftward over time, or towards socialism or fascism
1195800	1196840	or anything else.
1196840	1201180	No movement in any direction, left, right, or other, can truly be considered progress
1201180	1203320	or regress beyond your own personal views.
1203320	1206560	A great example of what I'm talking about is this one article I came across coming out
1206560	1209260	of Minnesota when preparing for the Roe v. Wade tubcast.
1209260	1213620	I want you to pay close attention to the language used by the pro-life people in this article.
1213620	1217700	If the US Supreme Court were to throw out the Roe v. Wade decision, abortions would
1217700	1221980	remain legal in Minnesota due to a state's Supreme Court ruling back in 1995.
1221980	1227020	The ruling, known as Doe vs. Gomez, guaranteed the right to abortion in Minnesota, and required
1227020	1229600	the state to cover the cost for low-income patients.
1229600	1234500	In order for us to move forward here in Minnesota, we do have to get rid of Doe vs. Gomez.
1234520	1239120	Getting rid of Roe vs. Wade and then Doe vs. Gomez are going to be big steps in the right
1239120	1243120	direction for us to ultimately restore protection for unborn children in Minnesota, where, through
1243120	1245420	most of our history, the unborn were protected.
1245420	1248960	Even though the pro-life guy appeals to history, he also uses progressive terminology.
1248960	1252720	And I don't mean progressive in terms of the political group, but in terms of appealing
1252720	1253880	to progress.
1253880	1257020	He says phrases like moving forward and steps in the right direction.
1257020	1261520	Because ultimately, everybody views themselves as progressing towards whatever they want.
1261520	1262680	That's what progression is.
1262680	1265780	If you want food from your fridge and then you walk over and get it, the act of walking
1265780	1267360	is progressing towards that goal.
1267360	1270680	The word progress simply means what you desire.
1270680	1275520	And to make progressivism into a political school simply attaches a moral framework that
1275520	1278320	centers your desire as an a priori good.
1278320	1282860	By calling somebody regressive or reactionary for not agreeing with your desires, or by
1282860	1287540	worshipping your own theorized end state as a utopian progressive vision, all you're
1287540	1289720	doing is exerting control over other people.
1289720	1292780	That is what is at the bottom of all progressive views.
1292780	1295760	Progressors are good because they have the desire they have, everyone else is bad, and
1295760	1296760	that's that.
1296760	1298080	I just can't get behind any of this though.
1298080	1301520	I don't believe in the reactionary idea that the past was entirely better all the
1301520	1303360	time, we should implement any of the old systems.
1303360	1306940	But I also don't believe that progress moves in any one direction, regardless of what direction
1306940	1307940	that is.
1307940	1309880	And that people who don't want what I want are just evil.
1309880	1312520	I don't believe that any sort of utopia can actually exist at all.
1312520	1316960	I think if I had to call progress something, I would say that it moves in all directions
1316960	1317960	simultaneously.
1317960	1320380	It radiates outward, like ripples on a pond.
1320380	1324160	Progress is simply the next thing you do, and everyone's got a different next thing.
1324160	1328680	So a concept of political progress, a concept of progress beyond your own personal goals,
1328680	1329680	just seems useless.
1329680	1333080	In other words, if you're conceptualizing progress, you should only do so on an individual
1333080	1334080	level.
1334080	1335800	It's progress if you want to lose weight and then you lose 10 pounds.
1335800	1339860	If your conception of progress is political, if it involves colonizing the minds of others,
1339860	1344240	and forcing people to engage with your narrowly defined ideas of not only how your life should
1344240	1348280	be run, but how the whole world should be run, then I think you are automatically a
1348280	1349280	tyrant.
1349280	1352760	That's why all of these socialists and anarchists on the left are, to me, no different than
1352760	1354160	fascists in the end.
1354160	1356120	And frankly, same with the reactionaries too.
1356120	1360240	Not because they have the same ideas, obviously they don't, but because they all have an anti-individual,
1360240	1361960	hyper dogmatic view of the world.
1361960	1365840	They all think that they are the ones who know what a universal, perfect conception
1365840	1370400	of progress is, and they will absolutely destroy everything in their pursuit of it.
1370400	1373960	But for me, not everything is political, the personal isn't political.
1373960	1378560	There are things outside the bounds of the state, and ultimately, progress is personal,
1378560	1379560	not political.
1379560	1384960	In this way, the policies of government can't be framed as progress or regress, as revolutionary
1384960	1390240	or reactionary, and any such framing simply appears to be a power grab that relies on
1390240	1394640	this idea of the end of history, that there can be a utopian perfection.
1394640	1398880	It's no surprise to me that every single time we've chased it, millions of people have died.
