00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
I made a video a couple years ago called, What is a Reactionary?, examining the meaning

00:09.840 --> 00:10.840
of the word.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.800
The political meaning, not the general one, which is literally just somebody who reacts

00:13.800 --> 00:14.800
to stuff.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.000
The description of that video reads, Revolution seems to be a privilege only afforded to the

00:19.000 --> 00:23.280
left, but the reality is, progress does not simply go in one political direction.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.540
I was on the right track, but there were still a few things I didn't understand.

00:26.540 --> 00:30.860
To begin with, the political definition of reactionary is, a person or a set of views

00:30.860 --> 00:35.700
opposing political or social liberalization or reform, or alternatively, a person who

00:35.700 --> 00:39.640
holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante, the previous political

00:39.640 --> 00:44.080
state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent

00:44.080 --> 00:45.480
from contemporary society.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.820
An easy joke to make, uses the first definition of the word.

00:47.820 --> 00:51.820
Since that definition points toward political or social liberalization, moving away from

00:51.820 --> 00:56.660
liberalism or being somehow anti-liberal means that you're a reactionary, which makes

00:56.660 --> 00:58.060
socialist reactionary.

00:58.060 --> 01:03.060
Sock Dunn Left had his jimmies rustled when I trolled Twitter with this joke, but it is

01:03.060 --> 01:04.780
just a joke, not a real criticism.

01:04.780 --> 01:07.740
The more serious definition of reactionary is that second one.

01:07.740 --> 01:12.660
It's what breadtubers use to label the Nazbols, the national Bolsheviks of Russia, as simultaneously

01:12.660 --> 01:14.920
both reactionary and on the left.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.940
At least, the more honest ones admit that they're on the left, just a part of the left

01:17.940 --> 01:18.940
that they don't like.

01:18.940 --> 01:21.500
The slimier ones try to pretend that the Nazbols are right wing.

01:21.500 --> 01:37.220
By the way, the national Bolsheviks are a faction within Russia that want to see a return

01:37.220 --> 01:41.540
to the Soviet Union's political and economic systems, they're simultaneously authoritarian

01:41.540 --> 01:45.500
leftist on the political compass, and reactionary in that they favor a return to a previous

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
status quo.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.380
I've been called reactionary quite a bit myself.

01:49.380 --> 01:52.120
Most recently by this person Natalie on Twitter.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.420
She is doing so in a thread where I ratioed her and it actually got under her skin a little

01:55.420 --> 01:56.420
bit.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.420
Listen, I'm not keffles.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.620
I don't care whether or not I ratio people.

01:58.620 --> 02:02.080
I don't view my personal worth as being made up of likes on social media.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.420
But let's examine this idea that I'm a reactionary YouTuber.

02:04.420 --> 02:07.620
I'm not taking it as an insult, but I do want to consider the label.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.300
What previous state of society do I want to return to?

02:10.300 --> 02:14.380
And in that state, are there actually values found there that we're currently lacking?

02:14.380 --> 02:16.660
I think there's an easy answer to those questions.

02:16.660 --> 02:20.740
In terms of freedom of expression, we were significantly more free, at least culturally,

02:20.740 --> 02:22.440
20 years ago than we are now.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.780
And by some very loose definition, that does make me a reactionary.

02:25.780 --> 02:28.500
But we're not simply doing the what is a reactionary video again.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.660
That's not the title of this video.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.120
We're talking about something that is related but different.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.800
And let me show you what inspired it.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.660
A while ago, there was a bit of drama where I made a video about the alt-right pipeline.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.120
And then Xanderhal responded to it.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.180
And then I responded to that on Adam and Sitch.

02:41.180 --> 02:43.080
And then Xanderhal said he'd come on the stream and then he didn't.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.120
And then Xanderhal ducked a future talk with me and also ducked one with Sargon, leaving

02:47.120 --> 02:49.160
Chud Logic wondering what was going on.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.720
Yeah, this whole thing was like a month ago.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.080
I was inspired to do this video back then and I just sat on the idea, sorry.

02:55.080 --> 02:59.000
During that Adam and Sitch stream, in Xanderhal's comment section, there was one message that

02:59.000 --> 03:02.740
briefly caught my eye, but there was no real way to talk about it in the moment.

03:02.740 --> 03:03.740
And here it is.

03:03.740 --> 03:07.800
I find it kind of funny how right wingers always say the left used to be X, but now

03:07.800 --> 03:08.800
it's too far.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.100
Like, bro, that's the point of progressivism.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.100
That we progress.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.340
We don't just sit at one place politically.

03:14.340 --> 03:19.300
300 years ago, totally abolishing the monarchy in favor of a liberal democracy was far left

03:19.300 --> 03:21.020
and crazy, but time moved on.

03:21.020 --> 03:25.960
As things change and we learn and experience and as a society we move forward and progress.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.200
In other words, to progress means always to move leftward.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.720
In this guy's point of view, the shifting of the overton window leftward over time is

03:32.720 --> 03:38.140
not only expected, not only required, but it is indeed a natural process of history.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.380
It's just how it is.

03:39.380 --> 03:43.700
Pressing not only means moving leftward over time, it means that it is the proper state

03:43.700 --> 03:48.780
of history to move leftward, that history itself has an animating force pushing society

03:48.780 --> 03:49.780
left.

03:49.780 --> 03:52.060
If you think I'm exaggerating here, it's not hard to find a breadtuber who will parrot

03:52.060 --> 03:53.300
this exact sentiment.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.580
It objectively is the case, I mean, by any standard whatsoever.

03:58.580 --> 04:04.820
Historically as you move linearly in time forward, political opinions move left.

04:04.820 --> 04:07.380
That's not an argument.

04:07.380 --> 04:14.020
Like literally it's progress, it's just how it works, it's just how humans operate.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.780
What are you talking about?

04:16.780 --> 04:17.780
Literally yes.

04:17.780 --> 04:19.860
It always moves left.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.320
It's also not hard to find a breadtuber who will point out, just like that commenter,

04:23.320 --> 04:27.900
that a progressive who fails to progress with the times will eventually become a reactionary.

04:27.900 --> 04:32.900
You motherfuckers larp as progressives until progressivism or the idea of challenging social

04:32.900 --> 04:35.420
norms suddenly overlaps with the norm that you like.

04:35.420 --> 04:39.520
I fucking hate it when people like you act like that, it's so fucking frustrating.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.480
Progressivism isn't just about being pro-gay or whatever the fuck else, okay?

04:42.480 --> 04:47.420
It's about a fundamental, unconditional willingness to challenge social norms, or at the very

04:47.420 --> 04:51.260
least to be understanding of the ways in which those social norms are formed and the influences

04:51.260 --> 04:53.820
those can have socially.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.060
That's progressivism.

04:55.060 --> 04:58.500
Because if you're just progressive, because you're like pro-gay or pro-trans or whatever,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.540
you're gonna be the next reactionary.

05:00.540 --> 05:04.900
It's not enough to just be pro whatever social shit people are for these days.

05:05.380 --> 05:12.740
You need to have a general awareness of how all these reactionary takes are beget by the

05:12.740 --> 05:15.400
normalization of social values.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.240
So in the minds of these people, the neutral position isn't actually remaining still.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.500
Neutrality is drifting leftward slowly over time.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.420
Progressivism is actively moving leftward quickly over time.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.020
And if you do remain at a standstill, you are automatically shifting right.

05:30.020 --> 05:34.000
Because it's not you that's actually moving, but the political landscape itself, shifting

05:34.000 --> 05:35.160
beneath your feet.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.980
Some might even say that people don't actually become more conservative as they age, rather

05:38.980 --> 05:42.920
their culture becomes more progressive over time, and their old progressive opinions become

05:42.920 --> 05:44.520
conservative ones as they get older.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.260
This is the source of those right-wing memes that show conservatives of the future arguing

05:48.260 --> 05:49.860
for progressive policies of today.

05:49.860 --> 05:54.060
And this is why I talked about being a reactionary at the start of the video, because Vosch correctly

05:54.060 --> 05:59.040
pointed out that, in the minds of many progressives, there are only two camps, them and reactionaries.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.760
And the more left you are, the more progressive you are.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.520
The more right you are, the more reactionary you are.

06:02.520 --> 06:06.160
So a person who is extremely progressive is going to be viewed as a reactionary by somebody

06:06.160 --> 06:09.120
who is just even a little bit further left than them.

06:09.120 --> 06:14.280
This entire interpretation rests on the assumption that progress and reaction are two forces

06:14.280 --> 06:18.820
that always oppose, and that to make gains in one necessarily must mean that you lose

06:18.820 --> 06:19.820
in the other.

06:19.820 --> 06:22.680
But I think that we can show that this is not exactly true.

06:22.680 --> 06:27.240
So many people on the left are desperately trying to redefine the Nazbols as right-wing,

06:27.240 --> 06:30.880
or other reactionary left elements like TERFs for example, even though they're clearly

06:30.880 --> 06:31.920
on the left.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.380
Because these are groups that are simultaneously progressive and reactionary.

06:35.380 --> 06:39.240
They want a return to a previous status quo, because they believe that that previous status

06:39.240 --> 06:42.600
quo represented more progress than what we're currently living in.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.000
Consider this, whenever a right-wing candidate wins an election, or a piece of left-wing

06:46.000 --> 06:50.840
policy falls apart, normies on social media will often post Star Trek memes.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.320
Star Trek is the progressive utopia in pop fiction, and these memes are often accompanied

06:54.320 --> 06:57.760
with stuff like, I thought we were moving forward, or this is the future that Democrats

06:57.760 --> 06:58.760
want.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.580
You see this as being a unidirectional path, an arrow that points at the bright shining

07:02.580 --> 07:06.720
utopian city on the hill where all of humanity's problems are solved, and the only possible

07:06.720 --> 07:09.560
way you could disagree with them is if you were stupid or evil.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.360
It couldn't be because they're wrong, because they want what's good.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.040
They're for progress after all.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.440
Meanwhile somebody like a Nazbol is much more likely to view the future like it looks and

07:17.440 --> 07:18.440
followed.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.480
If you were living in a post-apocalyptic tribalistic nuclear wasteland, you would be a reasonable

07:21.480 --> 07:26.520
person to long for a return to that old civilization, that old status quo of prosperity, even if

07:26.520 --> 07:28.400
it's reactionary to do so.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.640
Because the future isn't actually that good in that case.

07:30.640 --> 07:34.960
We don't even need to use these extreme detached from reality examples either.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.840
Is it progress that in Democrat controlled cities we see spiking drug use and urban decay?

07:39.840 --> 07:43.440
Is it reactionary to prefer a time in the past where there was more social cohesion?

07:43.440 --> 07:47.760
In other words, progressives view the nature of progress as being something like a technology

07:47.760 --> 07:49.340
tree in a game of civilization.

07:49.340 --> 07:52.760
You level up your progress, the new thing eventually becomes outdated, and those who

07:52.760 --> 07:56.200
cling to it become reactionary in the process, and progress marches on.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.920
There's only one way to go, and that is up.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.540
But in reality, there's actually a lot wrong with this conception of progress.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.440
For example, take the classical fascists.

08:04.440 --> 08:09.240
The socialists of today use reactionary to refer to fascism, or fascist adjacent.

08:09.240 --> 08:13.240
They have no problem calling people fascist for no reason, but if their target is such

08:13.240 --> 08:16.480
that it's too much of a reach even for them, they'll say reactionary instead.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.800
I've heard people like It's a Gundam or Turkey Tom be called reactionary because they

08:20.800 --> 08:23.380
make videos laughing at dumb fucks on social media.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.200
And yeah, they're literally reacting, but that's not the point.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.640
The point is that they're laughing at the silly things people do in the name of progress,

08:28.640 --> 08:33.260
which itself is a step towards suppressing progress by making people feel embarrassed

08:33.260 --> 08:34.880
for doing things that are progressive.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.960
So if you're making fun of something that's progressive, you're reactionary.

08:37.960 --> 08:42.080
Obviously, though, iconoclasts and comedians who laugh at everything, including laughing

08:42.080 --> 08:45.320
at the left, are not fascists, but progressives treat them like they are because if you're

08:45.320 --> 08:49.380
not progressing properly, you're a reactionary, and they view fascism as the natural end result

08:49.380 --> 08:50.960
of reactionary tendencies.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.700
That's why capitalism decays into fascism in their view, because progression is abandoning

08:54.700 --> 08:59.480
capitalism for socialism, or why liberalism props up fascism, because progression is overthrowing

08:59.480 --> 09:00.740
liberalism with socialism.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.740
It's all the same logic.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.340
Either you're a progressive socialist, or you're a reactionary fascist.

09:04.340 --> 09:08.420
If you claim to be neither, you automatically assist the reaction against revolution.

09:08.420 --> 09:14.620
It's very George Bush in a way.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.260
The problem with this view is that it's not true.

09:17.260 --> 09:20.940
Joseph de Maistre was the first reactionary, and the first one to really write about the

09:20.940 --> 09:22.380
philosophy of reaction.

09:22.380 --> 09:26.200
In the context of the French Revolution, de Maistre critiqued the Enlightenment as a destabilizing

09:26.200 --> 09:30.540
social force, that a monarchy ordained by God was the only form of government that had

09:30.540 --> 09:34.780
political legitimacy, and that the only way to cultivate social cohesion was through strict

09:34.780 --> 09:36.380
authority and hierarchy.

09:36.380 --> 09:40.580
His writing created the philosophical basis for modern European traditional conservatism,

09:40.580 --> 09:43.400
contrasting that with Edmund Burke's English liberal conservatism.

09:43.400 --> 09:48.660
In The Doctrine of Fascism, Mussolini writes at length about reactionaryism and de Maistre.

09:48.660 --> 09:53.820
The fascist negation of socialism, democracy, and liberalism should not, however, be interpreted

09:53.820 --> 09:59.380
as implying a desire to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789, a year

09:59.380 --> 10:03.220
commonly referred to as that which opened the demo-liberal century.

10:03.220 --> 10:04.620
History does not travel backwards.

10:04.620 --> 10:08.460
The fascist doctrine has not taken de Maistre as its prophet.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.460
Monarchical absolutism is of the past.

10:10.460 --> 10:15.420
Dead and done are feudal privileges and the division of society into closed, uncommunicating

10:15.420 --> 10:16.420
castes.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.980
The state is, however, a unique and original creation.

10:18.980 --> 10:23.640
It is not reactionary but revolutionary, for it anticipates the solution of certain universal

10:23.640 --> 10:25.780
problems which have been raised elsewhere.

10:25.780 --> 10:29.700
Fascism has outgrown the dilemma, monarchy versus republic, over which democratic regimes

10:29.700 --> 10:33.900
too long dallied, attributing all insufficiencies to the former and proning the latter as a

10:33.900 --> 10:35.140
regime of perfection.

10:35.140 --> 10:39.740
Whereas experience teaches that some republics are inherently reactionary and absolutist,

10:39.740 --> 10:43.300
while some monarchies accept the most daring political and social experiments.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.660
Look at the language used in these passages.

10:45.660 --> 10:49.180
The classical fascists viewed themselves not as reactionary but revolutionary.

10:49.180 --> 10:52.820
They viewed themselves as the solution to the capitalist versus socialist problem.

10:52.820 --> 10:57.060
In Hegelian terms, they viewed themselves as the synthesis to the thesis of capitalism

10:57.060 --> 10:58.780
and the antithesis of socialism.

10:58.780 --> 11:02.540
If you're a leftist watching this video, I already know what you're saying to yourself

11:02.540 --> 11:03.540
in your head.

11:03.540 --> 11:06.760
The fascists lied about everything, they just wanted to get people on their side.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.100
But no government commonly called a fascist ever actually instituted a true return to

11:11.100 --> 11:12.100
the past.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.940
The Nazis did not rebuild any of the old German empires or call Kaiser Wilhelm back to the

11:15.940 --> 11:17.620
throne from exile in the Netherlands.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.180
In fact, the Nazis hated the old German institutions.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.540
Mussolini viewed Italy's Catholicism not as a part of its conservative indigenous culture

11:24.540 --> 11:27.640
to be protected, but as a barrier hindering his consolidation of power.

11:27.640 --> 11:32.340
Japan had no desire to return to a pre-Miji restoration feudalistic era.

11:32.340 --> 11:36.620
Spain never had any desire to return to its old imperial ways, instead transitioning towards

11:36.620 --> 11:40.340
autarky, an economic move that is characteristically un-Spanish.

11:40.340 --> 11:44.220
The behaviors of these governments may not be revolutionary in the specific ways that

11:44.220 --> 11:48.140
terminally online socialists would prefer, but they clearly weren't seeking a return

11:48.140 --> 11:50.060
to a past state of politics.

11:50.060 --> 11:54.980
This isn't just my analysis either, utopian fascism is a topic that's been studied extensively.

11:54.980 --> 11:58.520
Utopia in the political sense is the end state of progress, the final goal.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.140
When all progressing has been done, when all possible improvements have been made, when

12:02.140 --> 12:06.300
every project has reached its culmination, human society achieves its perfection.

12:06.300 --> 12:10.100
And the fascists, rather than grasping for the imperfection of the past, had their own

12:10.100 --> 12:14.980
conception of utopia, separate from the leftist view of the stateless, moneyless, classless

12:14.980 --> 12:15.980
communism.

12:15.980 --> 12:20.340
The term reactionary modernism was coined by historians to try and explain this great

12:20.340 --> 12:24.700
contradiction within fascism, where they had a great admiration for the concept of progress,

12:24.700 --> 12:27.140
but they nonetheless rejected the socialist vision of it.

12:27.140 --> 12:31.060
The reason this appears to be a contradiction is because of the a priori assumption that

12:31.060 --> 12:33.620
the socialist vision of progress is the correct one.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.060
Again, it's the skill tree that only fills one way.

12:36.100 --> 12:40.340
It's the Star Trek thinking, having a vision of the future that only exists in theory inside

12:40.340 --> 12:43.140
your head, and then every move towards it is progress.

12:43.140 --> 12:46.920
Every move away from it is regress, regardless of the actual cause and effect of the moves

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
in reality.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.480
If you already have a mental structure in your head that says feudalism to capitalism

12:51.480 --> 12:55.180
to socialism to communism, all traveling along a conveyor belt, anything that doesn't fit

12:55.180 --> 12:58.140
into that move has to instead be pushing backwards.

12:58.140 --> 13:03.140
Like I said earlier, the fascists viewed themselves, not communism, as the stage beyond socialism.

13:03.220 --> 13:06.540
Again, the socialist reply to this is to scream that the fascists are lying.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.660
The socialist says, fascists lie.

13:08.660 --> 13:12.240
You cannot trust anything they say or write, they're subversive, they will do anything

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
to gain power.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.440
Putting aside for the moment, that sounds like nearly every single socialist online

13:16.440 --> 13:20.620
right now, it's also an anti-intellectual position to deliberately avoid an entire wing

13:20.620 --> 13:23.460
of knowledge simply because it comes from people you don't like.

13:23.460 --> 13:27.820
Dr. David Roberts, history professor at the University of Georgia writes in his book,

13:27.820 --> 13:31.880
Fascist Interactions, that the greatest advance in fascist studies over the last 40 years

13:31.880 --> 13:35.800
has come precisely from taking the fascist self-understanding seriously.

13:35.800 --> 13:40.080
By now it is widely held that fascism was not some revolt against modernity, but the

13:40.080 --> 13:42.000
quest for an alternative modernity.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.800
This would imply that it was not merely an effort to catch up to the modern democracies

13:45.800 --> 13:47.880
through different, more extreme means.

13:47.880 --> 13:52.160
And rather than merely counter-revolutionary or reactionary, fascism was in some sense

13:52.160 --> 13:54.040
revolutionary in its own right.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.080
Fascism may not be the type of revolutionary that your average online socialist likes,

13:57.080 --> 13:58.560
but it is revolutionary nonetheless.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.720
They viewed themselves as progressing, even if you might not.

14:01.720 --> 14:06.840
This view of progress as an ongoing unidirectionary method is called Whig Histiography.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.680
The Whigs were a British liberal movement before liberalism was a thing.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.480
What they were all about isn't too important right now, but they had a view of history

14:12.480 --> 14:16.520
as being a journey where humanity travels from an oppressive, cruel past into a glorious

14:16.520 --> 14:17.540
advanced future.

14:17.540 --> 14:22.160
They believe the ultimate culmination of Whig Histiography was liberal democracy and constitutional

14:22.160 --> 14:23.160
monarchy.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.960
The phrase Whig Histiography was originally coined as a satirical term, but was eventually

14:26.960 --> 14:29.200
adopted by the Whigs and later the liberals in the UK.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.000
The idea is that history has a goal that it actively moves towards, rather than simply

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
existing.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.120
This is where you get the phrase, the end of history.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.520
Socialism is built atop of the concept of Whig Histiography, that history has a goal

14:39.520 --> 14:43.240
it actively moves towards, but they disagree that the end stage is liberal democracy.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.320
Marx's view, being a revision of the Whigist view, considered socialism to be the next

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
stage after liberalism.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.400
Mussolini's view, being a revision of the Marxist view, considered fascism to be the

14:50.400 --> 14:51.400
next stage after socialism.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.480
It doesn't stop there.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.080
For example, Alexander Duggan, stylized as Putin's philosopher, much like Gentile was

14:57.080 --> 15:01.160
Mussolini's, and the creator of the national Bolshevik ideology, wrote his own book on

15:01.160 --> 15:03.280
this topic, the fourth political theory.

15:03.280 --> 15:08.080
He views his ideas as the next step beyond fascism, like Mussolini saw fascism being

15:08.080 --> 15:11.360
beyond socialism, and Marx saw socialism being beyond liberalism.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.140
His theory, the fourth theory, therefore is progress beyond those big three, at least

15:15.140 --> 15:16.140
according to him.

15:16.140 --> 15:19.520
This end of history, march of progress rhetoric, is appealing to many people that the left

15:19.520 --> 15:24.920
would call reactionary, even though reactionaryism explicitly rejects the march of progress.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.680
Rather than searching for alternative modes of progress like the fascists do.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.920
And this is where we come to the core of the issue.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.000
Fascists are not reactionaries.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.280
Fascists still worship the concept of progress in the same way that progressives and socialists

15:35.280 --> 15:37.480
do, they just have a different meaning of progress.

15:37.480 --> 15:42.020
Actual reactionaries reject the very concept of progress itself, and in doing so they simultaneously

15:42.020 --> 15:44.040
reject socialism and fascism.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.840
It is this distinction between a fascist and a reactionary that I don't think anybody on

15:47.840 --> 15:52.040
the online left understands right now, and I think that's why they have a hard time quantifying

15:52.040 --> 15:55.640
right wing politics beyond simply saying the right is bad and then getting upvotes

15:55.640 --> 15:56.640
online.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.200
Julius Evola was a philosopher in fascist Italy, and he is considered a fascist by many,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
but he called himself a super-fascist.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.040
What he meant by that was he considered the classical fascist as not being fascist enough

16:06.040 --> 16:11.480
for his tastes, and his writing would ultimately discard classical fascism for not being reactionary.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.800
Evola's most famous work, Revolt Against the Modern World, is explicitly anti-modern

16:15.800 --> 16:18.760
in all of its forms, liberal, socialist, and fascist.

16:18.760 --> 16:23.040
The neo-reactionary movement, otherwise known as the Dark Enlightenment, are, true to their

16:23.040 --> 16:24.400
name, explicitly reactionary.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.240
Evola is one of their bedrocks, along with anarcho-capitalists like Hoppe, and modern

16:28.240 --> 16:29.880
figures like Mentious Moldbug.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.020
Rather than seeking an alternative progress like the fascists do, rather than declaring

16:33.020 --> 16:37.440
themselves the next stage in the march of history, they reject Whig histography altogether.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.720
They advocate not for a fascist government, but an actual return to older forms of government,

16:41.720 --> 16:43.520
like absolute monarchy or Cameralism.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.240
These people aren't fascists, they're actually reactionaries, they're not futurists

16:47.240 --> 16:48.240
the way the fascists were.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.440
They reject progress as a virtue, rather than arguing over what constitutes the next

16:51.440 --> 16:52.440
stage of it.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.040
And when socialists call everyone who's not them reactionary or fascists, they just

16:56.040 --> 16:57.560
don't understand the words they're using.

16:57.560 --> 17:01.400
When people out there call It's a Gundam or Turkey Tom or myself reactionary YouTubers,

17:01.400 --> 17:02.960
they have no clue what they're talking about.

17:02.960 --> 17:06.640
We may not agree with your conception of progress, or the fascist one for that matter, but that

17:06.640 --> 17:10.280
doesn't mean that we reject progress entirely, we have our own idea of what it is.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.440
We don't want to return to a previous political paradigm, a priori.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.160
We may want to see the restoration of virtues lost to the past, not because it's in the

17:17.160 --> 17:19.880
past, but because we view society as having regressed.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.000
It's the difference between looking at a past era and wanting it because it represents

17:23.000 --> 17:26.880
going back and the concept of progress as bad, that's the reactionary view, and looking

17:26.880 --> 17:31.280
at a past era and wanting it returned because it actually represents real progress, and

17:31.280 --> 17:33.840
the path that we've gone down is fake progress.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.840
And that is where I am.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.960
I'm not a reactionary, I don't value regression, but I don't believe that what the socialists

17:38.960 --> 17:43.320
or the fascists call progressive actually contains any real progress at all.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.760
They're all just different flavors of failure, distinct from each other, but nothing I'm

17:46.760 --> 17:47.760
interested in.

17:47.760 --> 17:51.160
I mentioned the Hegelian method earlier, and that's partially because Hegel's view of history

17:51.160 --> 17:53.640
is the ultimate end of the concept of progress.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.880
Whether it's socialist or fascist or either type of ist, Hegel's view is that the march

17:56.880 --> 18:01.500
of progress, and history automatically engaging in that march, a view called historicism,

18:01.500 --> 18:04.780
has its natural end in the authoritarian, bureaucratic state.

18:04.780 --> 18:07.560
This would later be coined as totalitarian by the fascists.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.080
But the socialists would also embrace this concept.

18:10.080 --> 18:13.760
Where Mussolini would say, all within the state, the socialists would say everything

18:13.760 --> 18:14.760
is political.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.900
The same concept, two sides of the same coin.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.840
A utopia in its perfection would have to be totalitarian, because perfection means perfection

18:20.840 --> 18:21.840
in all places.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.400
That's why they always say a real socialist has never been tried, because it has to be

18:24.400 --> 18:28.280
everywhere, so that the imperfection of other locations cannot simply upend the construction.

18:28.280 --> 18:32.520
A utopia in its perfection would have to be bureaucratic, because if, as Mussolini said,

18:32.520 --> 18:35.040
everything is within the state, everything needs to be controlled and managed.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.780
A utopia in its perfection would have to be authoritarian, because if you've already got

18:38.780 --> 18:43.260
everything perfectly correct, there is no need to tolerate any more dissent, or debate,

18:43.260 --> 18:45.140
or people leaving and going their own way.

18:45.140 --> 18:48.500
All utopianism, regardless of political slant, is totalitarian.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.580
And all political movements that believe in the march of progress, in this historicism,

18:52.580 --> 18:55.380
that history has a teleology, is ultimately utopian.

18:55.380 --> 18:59.420
The neo-reactionaries might reject this whole process, but I think they throw the baby out

18:59.420 --> 19:00.420
with the bathwater.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.940
For all of the ills of modernity, it's brought with it a lot of good.

19:02.940 --> 19:05.460
So the question is, what's the solution to this problem?

19:05.460 --> 19:09.240
Max Weber was a German historian and economist, founder of the field that would later be known

19:09.240 --> 19:13.880
as sociology, and the inventor of the concept of methodological individualism, the idea

19:13.880 --> 19:17.980
that individual motivations explain social phenomena, and that class dynamics are ultimately

19:17.980 --> 19:19.200
just illusions.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.620
This idea was accepted by neoclassical economists, Austrian economists, I think pretty much every

19:23.620 --> 19:27.000
economic school other than the socialists, but it's not a purely economic idea.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.400
Weber's interest was in the intersection of economics and history, and he is known for

19:30.400 --> 19:34.660
saying, history consists of individual relations and events, and it is not the job of those

19:34.660 --> 19:39.080
who study history to develop from it a social science or ideology to guide our way.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.080
I think my view of progress is more in line with Weber's idea.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.420
There is no end of history.

19:44.420 --> 19:48.840
There is no destiny that human society must pursue at all costs, or resist at all costs,

19:48.840 --> 19:50.040
as the reactionaries would have it.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.040
There is no utopia that we can build.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.800
History does not naturally trend leftward over time, or towards socialism or fascism

19:55.800 --> 19:56.840
or anything else.

19:56.840 --> 20:01.180
No movement in any direction, left, right, or other, can truly be considered progress

20:01.180 --> 20:03.320
or regress beyond your own personal views.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.560
A great example of what I'm talking about is this one article I came across coming out

20:06.560 --> 20:09.260
of Minnesota when preparing for the Roe v. Wade tubcast.

20:09.260 --> 20:13.620
I want you to pay close attention to the language used by the pro-life people in this article.

20:13.620 --> 20:17.700
If the US Supreme Court were to throw out the Roe v. Wade decision, abortions would

20:17.700 --> 20:21.980
remain legal in Minnesota due to a state's Supreme Court ruling back in 1995.

20:21.980 --> 20:27.020
The ruling, known as Doe vs. Gomez, guaranteed the right to abortion in Minnesota, and required

20:27.020 --> 20:29.600
the state to cover the cost for low-income patients.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.500
In order for us to move forward here in Minnesota, we do have to get rid of Doe vs. Gomez.

20:34.520 --> 20:39.120
Getting rid of Roe vs. Wade and then Doe vs. Gomez are going to be big steps in the right

20:39.120 --> 20:43.120
direction for us to ultimately restore protection for unborn children in Minnesota, where, through

20:43.120 --> 20:45.420
most of our history, the unborn were protected.

20:45.420 --> 20:48.960
Even though the pro-life guy appeals to history, he also uses progressive terminology.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.720
And I don't mean progressive in terms of the political group, but in terms of appealing

20:52.720 --> 20:53.880
to progress.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.020
He says phrases like moving forward and steps in the right direction.

20:57.020 --> 21:01.520
Because ultimately, everybody views themselves as progressing towards whatever they want.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.680
That's what progression is.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.780
If you want food from your fridge and then you walk over and get it, the act of walking

21:05.780 --> 21:07.360
is progressing towards that goal.

21:07.360 --> 21:10.680
The word progress simply means what you desire.

21:10.680 --> 21:15.520
And to make progressivism into a political school simply attaches a moral framework that

21:15.520 --> 21:18.320
centers your desire as an a priori good.

21:18.320 --> 21:22.860
By calling somebody regressive or reactionary for not agreeing with your desires, or by

21:22.860 --> 21:27.540
worshipping your own theorized end state as a utopian progressive vision, all you're

21:27.540 --> 21:29.720
doing is exerting control over other people.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.780
That is what is at the bottom of all progressive views.

21:32.780 --> 21:35.760
Progressors are good because they have the desire they have, everyone else is bad, and

21:35.760 --> 21:36.760
that's that.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.080
I just can't get behind any of this though.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.520
I don't believe in the reactionary idea that the past was entirely better all the

21:41.520 --> 21:43.360
time, we should implement any of the old systems.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.940
But I also don't believe that progress moves in any one direction, regardless of what direction

21:46.940 --> 21:47.940
that is.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.880
And that people who don't want what I want are just evil.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.520
I don't believe that any sort of utopia can actually exist at all.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.960
I think if I had to call progress something, I would say that it moves in all directions

21:56.960 --> 21:57.960
simultaneously.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.380
It radiates outward, like ripples on a pond.

22:00.380 --> 22:04.160
Progress is simply the next thing you do, and everyone's got a different next thing.

22:04.160 --> 22:08.680
So a concept of political progress, a concept of progress beyond your own personal goals,

22:08.680 --> 22:09.680
just seems useless.

22:09.680 --> 22:13.080
In other words, if you're conceptualizing progress, you should only do so on an individual

22:13.080 --> 22:14.080
level.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.800
It's progress if you want to lose weight and then you lose 10 pounds.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.860
If your conception of progress is political, if it involves colonizing the minds of others,

22:19.860 --> 22:24.240
and forcing people to engage with your narrowly defined ideas of not only how your life should

22:24.240 --> 22:28.280
be run, but how the whole world should be run, then I think you are automatically a

22:28.280 --> 22:29.280
tyrant.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.760
That's why all of these socialists and anarchists on the left are, to me, no different than

22:32.760 --> 22:34.160
fascists in the end.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.120
And frankly, same with the reactionaries too.

22:36.120 --> 22:40.240
Not because they have the same ideas, obviously they don't, but because they all have an anti-individual,

22:40.240 --> 22:41.960
hyper dogmatic view of the world.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.840
They all think that they are the ones who know what a universal, perfect conception

22:45.840 --> 22:50.400
of progress is, and they will absolutely destroy everything in their pursuit of it.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.960
But for me, not everything is political, the personal isn't political.

22:53.960 --> 22:58.560
There are things outside the bounds of the state, and ultimately, progress is personal,

22:58.560 --> 22:59.560
not political.

22:59.560 --> 23:04.960
In this way, the policies of government can't be framed as progress or regress, as revolutionary

23:04.960 --> 23:10.240
or reactionary, and any such framing simply appears to be a power grab that relies on

23:10.240 --> 23:14.640
this idea of the end of history, that there can be a utopian perfection.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.880
It's no surprise to me that every single time we've chased it, millions of people have died.
