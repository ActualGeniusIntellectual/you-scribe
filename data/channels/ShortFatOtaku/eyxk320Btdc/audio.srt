1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
I made a video a couple years ago called, What is a Reactionary?, examining the meaning

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
of the word.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,800
The political meaning, not the general one, which is literally just somebody who reacts

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
to stuff.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,000
The description of that video reads, Revolution seems to be a privilege only afforded to the

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,280
left, but the reality is, progress does not simply go in one political direction.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,540
I was on the right track, but there were still a few things I didn't understand.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,860
To begin with, the political definition of reactionary is, a person or a set of views

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,700
opposing political or social liberalization or reform, or alternatively, a person who

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,640
holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante, the previous political

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,080
state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,480
from contemporary society.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,820
An easy joke to make, uses the first definition of the word.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Since that definition points toward political or social liberalization, moving away from

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,660
liberalism or being somehow anti-liberal means that you're a reactionary, which makes

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,060
socialist reactionary.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,060
Sock Dunn Left had his jimmies rustled when I trolled Twitter with this joke, but it is

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,780
just a joke, not a real criticism.

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,740
The more serious definition of reactionary is that second one.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,660
It's what breadtubers use to label the Nazbols, the national Bolsheviks of Russia, as simultaneously

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,920
both reactionary and on the left.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,940
At least, the more honest ones admit that they're on the left, just a part of the left

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
that they don't like.

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,500
The slimier ones try to pretend that the Nazbols are right wing.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:37,220
By the way, the national Bolsheviks are a faction within Russia that want to see a return

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,540
to the Soviet Union's political and economic systems, they're simultaneously authoritarian

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,500
leftist on the political compass, and reactionary in that they favor a return to a previous

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
status quo.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,380
I've been called reactionary quite a bit myself.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,120
Most recently by this person Natalie on Twitter.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,420
She is doing so in a thread where I ratioed her and it actually got under her skin a little

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
bit.

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,420
Listen, I'm not keffles.

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,620
I don't care whether or not I ratio people.

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,080
I don't view my personal worth as being made up of likes on social media.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,420
But let's examine this idea that I'm a reactionary YouTuber.

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,620
I'm not taking it as an insult, but I do want to consider the label.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,300
What previous state of society do I want to return to?

39
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,380
And in that state, are there actually values found there that we're currently lacking?

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,660
I think there's an easy answer to those questions.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,740
In terms of freedom of expression, we were significantly more free, at least culturally,

42
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,440
20 years ago than we are now.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,780
And by some very loose definition, that does make me a reactionary.

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,500
But we're not simply doing the what is a reactionary video again.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,660
That's not the title of this video.

46
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,120
We're talking about something that is related but different.

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
And let me show you what inspired it.

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,660
A while ago, there was a bit of drama where I made a video about the alt-right pipeline.

49
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,120
And then Xanderhal responded to it.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,180
And then I responded to that on Adam and Sitch.

51
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,080
And then Xanderhal said he'd come on the stream and then he didn't.

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,120
And then Xanderhal ducked a future talk with me and also ducked one with Sargon, leaving

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,160
Chud Logic wondering what was going on.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,720
Yeah, this whole thing was like a month ago.

55
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,080
I was inspired to do this video back then and I just sat on the idea, sorry.

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,000
During that Adam and Sitch stream, in Xanderhal's comment section, there was one message that

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,740
briefly caught my eye, but there was no real way to talk about it in the moment.

58
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,740
And here it is.

59
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,800
I find it kind of funny how right wingers always say the left used to be X, but now

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
it's too far.

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,100
Like, bro, that's the point of progressivism.

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
That we progress.

63
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,340
We don't just sit at one place politically.

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,300
300 years ago, totally abolishing the monarchy in favor of a liberal democracy was far left

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,020
and crazy, but time moved on.

66
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,960
As things change and we learn and experience and as a society we move forward and progress.

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,200
In other words, to progress means always to move leftward.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
In this guy's point of view, the shifting of the overton window leftward over time is

69
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,140
not only expected, not only required, but it is indeed a natural process of history.

70
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,380
It's just how it is.

71
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,700
Pressing not only means moving leftward over time, it means that it is the proper state

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,780
of history to move leftward, that history itself has an animating force pushing society

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,780
left.

74
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,060
If you think I'm exaggerating here, it's not hard to find a breadtuber who will parrot

75
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,300
this exact sentiment.

76
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,580
It objectively is the case, I mean, by any standard whatsoever.

77
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,820
Historically as you move linearly in time forward, political opinions move left.

78
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,380
That's not an argument.

79
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,020
Like literally it's progress, it's just how it works, it's just how humans operate.

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,780
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,780
Literally yes.

82
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,860
It always moves left.

83
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,320
It's also not hard to find a breadtuber who will point out, just like that commenter,

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,900
that a progressive who fails to progress with the times will eventually become a reactionary.

85
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,900
You motherfuckers larp as progressives until progressivism or the idea of challenging social

86
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,420
norms suddenly overlaps with the norm that you like.

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,520
I fucking hate it when people like you act like that, it's so fucking frustrating.

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,480
Progressivism isn't just about being pro-gay or whatever the fuck else, okay?

89
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,420
It's about a fundamental, unconditional willingness to challenge social norms, or at the very

90
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,260
least to be understanding of the ways in which those social norms are formed and the influences

91
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,820
those can have socially.

92
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,060
That's progressivism.

93
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,500
Because if you're just progressive, because you're like pro-gay or pro-trans or whatever,

94
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,540
you're gonna be the next reactionary.

95
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,900
It's not enough to just be pro whatever social shit people are for these days.

96
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:12,740
You need to have a general awareness of how all these reactionary takes are beget by the

97
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,400
normalization of social values.

98
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,240
So in the minds of these people, the neutral position isn't actually remaining still.

99
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,500
Neutrality is drifting leftward slowly over time.

100
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,420
Progressivism is actively moving leftward quickly over time.

101
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,020
And if you do remain at a standstill, you are automatically shifting right.

102
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,000
Because it's not you that's actually moving, but the political landscape itself, shifting

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,160
beneath your feet.

104
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,980
Some might even say that people don't actually become more conservative as they age, rather

105
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,920
their culture becomes more progressive over time, and their old progressive opinions become

106
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,520
conservative ones as they get older.

107
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,260
This is the source of those right-wing memes that show conservatives of the future arguing

108
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,860
for progressive policies of today.

109
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,060
And this is why I talked about being a reactionary at the start of the video, because Vosch correctly

110
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,040
pointed out that, in the minds of many progressives, there are only two camps, them and reactionaries.

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,760
And the more left you are, the more progressive you are.

112
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,520
The more right you are, the more reactionary you are.

113
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,160
So a person who is extremely progressive is going to be viewed as a reactionary by somebody

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
who is just even a little bit further left than them.

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,280
This entire interpretation rests on the assumption that progress and reaction are two forces

116
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,820
that always oppose, and that to make gains in one necessarily must mean that you lose

117
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
in the other.

118
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,680
But I think that we can show that this is not exactly true.

119
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,240
So many people on the left are desperately trying to redefine the Nazbols as right-wing,

120
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,880
or other reactionary left elements like TERFs for example, even though they're clearly

121
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
on the left.

122
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,380
Because these are groups that are simultaneously progressive and reactionary.

123
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,240
They want a return to a previous status quo, because they believe that that previous status

124
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,600
quo represented more progress than what we're currently living in.

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Consider this, whenever a right-wing candidate wins an election, or a piece of left-wing

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,840
policy falls apart, normies on social media will often post Star Trek memes.

127
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,320
Star Trek is the progressive utopia in pop fiction, and these memes are often accompanied

128
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,760
with stuff like, I thought we were moving forward, or this is the future that Democrats

129
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
want.

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,580
You see this as being a unidirectional path, an arrow that points at the bright shining

131
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,720
utopian city on the hill where all of humanity's problems are solved, and the only possible

132
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,560
way you could disagree with them is if you were stupid or evil.

133
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,360
It couldn't be because they're wrong, because they want what's good.

134
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,040
They're for progress after all.

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,440
Meanwhile somebody like a Nazbol is much more likely to view the future like it looks and

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
followed.

137
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,480
If you were living in a post-apocalyptic tribalistic nuclear wasteland, you would be a reasonable

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,520
person to long for a return to that old civilization, that old status quo of prosperity, even if

139
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,400
it's reactionary to do so.

140
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,640
Because the future isn't actually that good in that case.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,960
We don't even need to use these extreme detached from reality examples either.

142
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,840
Is it progress that in Democrat controlled cities we see spiking drug use and urban decay?

143
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,440
Is it reactionary to prefer a time in the past where there was more social cohesion?

144
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,760
In other words, progressives view the nature of progress as being something like a technology

145
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,340
tree in a game of civilization.

146
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,760
You level up your progress, the new thing eventually becomes outdated, and those who

147
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,200
cling to it become reactionary in the process, and progress marches on.

148
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,920
There's only one way to go, and that is up.

149
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,540
But in reality, there's actually a lot wrong with this conception of progress.

150
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,440
For example, take the classical fascists.

151
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,240
The socialists of today use reactionary to refer to fascism, or fascist adjacent.

152
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,240
They have no problem calling people fascist for no reason, but if their target is such

153
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,480
that it's too much of a reach even for them, they'll say reactionary instead.

154
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,800
I've heard people like It's a Gundam or Turkey Tom be called reactionary because they

155
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,380
make videos laughing at dumb fucks on social media.

156
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,200
And yeah, they're literally reacting, but that's not the point.

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,640
The point is that they're laughing at the silly things people do in the name of progress,

158
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,260
which itself is a step towards suppressing progress by making people feel embarrassed

159
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,880
for doing things that are progressive.

160
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,960
So if you're making fun of something that's progressive, you're reactionary.

161
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,080
Obviously, though, iconoclasts and comedians who laugh at everything, including laughing

162
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,320
at the left, are not fascists, but progressives treat them like they are because if you're

163
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,380
not progressing properly, you're a reactionary, and they view fascism as the natural end result

164
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,960
of reactionary tendencies.

165
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,700
That's why capitalism decays into fascism in their view, because progression is abandoning

166
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,480
capitalism for socialism, or why liberalism props up fascism, because progression is overthrowing

167
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,740
liberalism with socialism.

168
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
It's all the same logic.

169
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,340
Either you're a progressive socialist, or you're a reactionary fascist.

170
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,420
If you claim to be neither, you automatically assist the reaction against revolution.

171
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,620
It's very George Bush in a way.

172
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,260
The problem with this view is that it's not true.

173
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,940
Joseph de Maistre was the first reactionary, and the first one to really write about the

174
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,380
philosophy of reaction.

175
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,200
In the context of the French Revolution, de Maistre critiqued the Enlightenment as a destabilizing

176
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,540
social force, that a monarchy ordained by God was the only form of government that had

177
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,780
political legitimacy, and that the only way to cultivate social cohesion was through strict

178
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,380
authority and hierarchy.

179
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,580
His writing created the philosophical basis for modern European traditional conservatism,

180
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,400
contrasting that with Edmund Burke's English liberal conservatism.

181
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,660
In The Doctrine of Fascism, Mussolini writes at length about reactionaryism and de Maistre.

182
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,820
The fascist negation of socialism, democracy, and liberalism should not, however, be interpreted

183
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,380
as implying a desire to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789, a year

184
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,220
commonly referred to as that which opened the demo-liberal century.

185
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,620
History does not travel backwards.

186
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,460
The fascist doctrine has not taken de Maistre as its prophet.

187
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,460
Monarchical absolutism is of the past.

188
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,420
Dead and done are feudal privileges and the division of society into closed, uncommunicating

189
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,420
castes.

190
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,980
The state is, however, a unique and original creation.

191
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,640
It is not reactionary but revolutionary, for it anticipates the solution of certain universal

192
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,780
problems which have been raised elsewhere.

193
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,700
Fascism has outgrown the dilemma, monarchy versus republic, over which democratic regimes

194
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,900
too long dallied, attributing all insufficiencies to the former and proning the latter as a

195
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,140
regime of perfection.

196
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,740
Whereas experience teaches that some republics are inherently reactionary and absolutist,

197
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,300
while some monarchies accept the most daring political and social experiments.

198
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,660
Look at the language used in these passages.

199
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,180
The classical fascists viewed themselves not as reactionary but revolutionary.

200
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,820
They viewed themselves as the solution to the capitalist versus socialist problem.

201
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,060
In Hegelian terms, they viewed themselves as the synthesis to the thesis of capitalism

202
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,780
and the antithesis of socialism.

203
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,540
If you're a leftist watching this video, I already know what you're saying to yourself

204
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,540
in your head.

205
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,760
The fascists lied about everything, they just wanted to get people on their side.

206
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,100
But no government commonly called a fascist ever actually instituted a true return to

207
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
the past.

208
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,940
The Nazis did not rebuild any of the old German empires or call Kaiser Wilhelm back to the

209
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,620
throne from exile in the Netherlands.

210
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,180
In fact, the Nazis hated the old German institutions.

211
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,540
Mussolini viewed Italy's Catholicism not as a part of its conservative indigenous culture

212
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,640
to be protected, but as a barrier hindering his consolidation of power.

213
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,340
Japan had no desire to return to a pre-Miji restoration feudalistic era.

214
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,620
Spain never had any desire to return to its old imperial ways, instead transitioning towards

215
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,340
autarky, an economic move that is characteristically un-Spanish.

216
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,220
The behaviors of these governments may not be revolutionary in the specific ways that

217
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,140
terminally online socialists would prefer, but they clearly weren't seeking a return

218
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,060
to a past state of politics.

219
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,980
This isn't just my analysis either, utopian fascism is a topic that's been studied extensively.

220
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,520
Utopia in the political sense is the end state of progress, the final goal.

221
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,140
When all progressing has been done, when all possible improvements have been made, when

222
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,300
every project has reached its culmination, human society achieves its perfection.

223
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,100
And the fascists, rather than grasping for the imperfection of the past, had their own

224
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,980
conception of utopia, separate from the leftist view of the stateless, moneyless, classless

225
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
communism.

226
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,340
The term reactionary modernism was coined by historians to try and explain this great

227
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,700
contradiction within fascism, where they had a great admiration for the concept of progress,

228
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,140
but they nonetheless rejected the socialist vision of it.

229
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,060
The reason this appears to be a contradiction is because of the a priori assumption that

230
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,620
the socialist vision of progress is the correct one.

231
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,060
Again, it's the skill tree that only fills one way.

232
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,340
It's the Star Trek thinking, having a vision of the future that only exists in theory inside

233
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,140
your head, and then every move towards it is progress.

234
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,920
Every move away from it is regress, regardless of the actual cause and effect of the moves

235
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
in reality.

236
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,480
If you already have a mental structure in your head that says feudalism to capitalism

237
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,180
to socialism to communism, all traveling along a conveyor belt, anything that doesn't fit

238
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,140
into that move has to instead be pushing backwards.

239
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Like I said earlier, the fascists viewed themselves, not communism, as the stage beyond socialism.

240
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,540
Again, the socialist reply to this is to scream that the fascists are lying.

241
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,660
The socialist says, fascists lie.

242
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,240
You cannot trust anything they say or write, they're subversive, they will do anything

243
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
to gain power.

244
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,440
Putting aside for the moment, that sounds like nearly every single socialist online

245
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,620
right now, it's also an anti-intellectual position to deliberately avoid an entire wing

246
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,460
of knowledge simply because it comes from people you don't like.

247
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,820
Dr. David Roberts, history professor at the University of Georgia writes in his book,

248
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,880
Fascist Interactions, that the greatest advance in fascist studies over the last 40 years

249
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,800
has come precisely from taking the fascist self-understanding seriously.

250
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,080
By now it is widely held that fascism was not some revolt against modernity, but the

251
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,000
quest for an alternative modernity.

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,800
This would imply that it was not merely an effort to catch up to the modern democracies

253
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,880
through different, more extreme means.

254
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,160
And rather than merely counter-revolutionary or reactionary, fascism was in some sense

255
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,040
revolutionary in its own right.

256
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,080
Fascism may not be the type of revolutionary that your average online socialist likes,

257
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,560
but it is revolutionary nonetheless.

258
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,720
They viewed themselves as progressing, even if you might not.

259
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,840
This view of progress as an ongoing unidirectionary method is called Whig Histiography.

260
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,680
The Whigs were a British liberal movement before liberalism was a thing.

261
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,480
What they were all about isn't too important right now, but they had a view of history

262
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,520
as being a journey where humanity travels from an oppressive, cruel past into a glorious

263
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,540
advanced future.

264
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,160
They believe the ultimate culmination of Whig Histiography was liberal democracy and constitutional

265
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
monarchy.

266
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,960
The phrase Whig Histiography was originally coined as a satirical term, but was eventually

267
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,200
adopted by the Whigs and later the liberals in the UK.

268
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,000
The idea is that history has a goal that it actively moves towards, rather than simply

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
existing.

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,120
This is where you get the phrase, the end of history.

271
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,520
Socialism is built atop of the concept of Whig Histiography, that history has a goal

272
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,240
it actively moves towards, but they disagree that the end stage is liberal democracy.

273
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,320
Marx's view, being a revision of the Whigist view, considered socialism to be the next

274
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
stage after liberalism.

275
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,400
Mussolini's view, being a revision of the Marxist view, considered fascism to be the

276
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
next stage after socialism.

277
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,480
It doesn't stop there.

278
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,080
For example, Alexander Duggan, stylized as Putin's philosopher, much like Gentile was

279
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,160
Mussolini's, and the creator of the national Bolshevik ideology, wrote his own book on

280
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,280
this topic, the fourth political theory.

281
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,080
He views his ideas as the next step beyond fascism, like Mussolini saw fascism being

282
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,360
beyond socialism, and Marx saw socialism being beyond liberalism.

283
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,140
His theory, the fourth theory, therefore is progress beyond those big three, at least

284
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
according to him.

285
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,520
This end of history, march of progress rhetoric, is appealing to many people that the left

286
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,920
would call reactionary, even though reactionaryism explicitly rejects the march of progress.

287
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,680
Rather than searching for alternative modes of progress like the fascists do.

288
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
And this is where we come to the core of the issue.

289
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,000
Fascists are not reactionaries.

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,280
Fascists still worship the concept of progress in the same way that progressives and socialists

291
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,480
do, they just have a different meaning of progress.

292
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,020
Actual reactionaries reject the very concept of progress itself, and in doing so they simultaneously

293
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,040
reject socialism and fascism.

294
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,840
It is this distinction between a fascist and a reactionary that I don't think anybody on

295
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,040
the online left understands right now, and I think that's why they have a hard time quantifying

296
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,640
right wing politics beyond simply saying the right is bad and then getting upvotes

297
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
online.

298
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,200
Julius Evola was a philosopher in fascist Italy, and he is considered a fascist by many,

299
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
but he called himself a super-fascist.

300
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,040
What he meant by that was he considered the classical fascist as not being fascist enough

301
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,480
for his tastes, and his writing would ultimately discard classical fascism for not being reactionary.

302
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,800
Evola's most famous work, Revolt Against the Modern World, is explicitly anti-modern

303
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,760
in all of its forms, liberal, socialist, and fascist.

304
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,040
The neo-reactionary movement, otherwise known as the Dark Enlightenment, are, true to their

305
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,400
name, explicitly reactionary.

306
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,240
Evola is one of their bedrocks, along with anarcho-capitalists like Hoppe, and modern

307
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,880
figures like Mentious Moldbug.

308
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,020
Rather than seeking an alternative progress like the fascists do, rather than declaring

309
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,440
themselves the next stage in the march of history, they reject Whig histography altogether.

310
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,720
They advocate not for a fascist government, but an actual return to older forms of government,

311
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,520
like absolute monarchy or Cameralism.

312
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,240
These people aren't fascists, they're actually reactionaries, they're not futurists

313
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
the way the fascists were.

314
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,440
They reject progress as a virtue, rather than arguing over what constitutes the next

315
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
stage of it.

316
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,040
And when socialists call everyone who's not them reactionary or fascists, they just

317
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,560
don't understand the words they're using.

318
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,400
When people out there call It's a Gundam or Turkey Tom or myself reactionary YouTubers,

319
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,960
they have no clue what they're talking about.

320
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,640
We may not agree with your conception of progress, or the fascist one for that matter, but that

321
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,280
doesn't mean that we reject progress entirely, we have our own idea of what it is.

322
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,440
We don't want to return to a previous political paradigm, a priori.

323
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,160
We may want to see the restoration of virtues lost to the past, not because it's in the

324
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,880
past, but because we view society as having regressed.

325
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,000
It's the difference between looking at a past era and wanting it because it represents

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,880
going back and the concept of progress as bad, that's the reactionary view, and looking

327
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
at a past era and wanting it returned because it actually represents real progress, and

328
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,840
the path that we've gone down is fake progress.

329
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
And that is where I am.

330
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,960
I'm not a reactionary, I don't value regression, but I don't believe that what the socialists

331
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,320
or the fascists call progressive actually contains any real progress at all.

332
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,760
They're all just different flavors of failure, distinct from each other, but nothing I'm

333
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
interested in.

334
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,160
I mentioned the Hegelian method earlier, and that's partially because Hegel's view of history

335
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,640
is the ultimate end of the concept of progress.

336
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,880
Whether it's socialist or fascist or either type of ist, Hegel's view is that the march

337
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,500
of progress, and history automatically engaging in that march, a view called historicism,

338
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,780
has its natural end in the authoritarian, bureaucratic state.

339
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,560
This would later be coined as totalitarian by the fascists.

340
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,080
But the socialists would also embrace this concept.

341
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,760
Where Mussolini would say, all within the state, the socialists would say everything

342
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
is political.

343
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,900
The same concept, two sides of the same coin.

344
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,840
A utopia in its perfection would have to be totalitarian, because perfection means perfection

345
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
in all places.

346
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,400
That's why they always say a real socialist has never been tried, because it has to be

347
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,280
everywhere, so that the imperfection of other locations cannot simply upend the construction.

348
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,520
A utopia in its perfection would have to be bureaucratic, because if, as Mussolini said,

349
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,040
everything is within the state, everything needs to be controlled and managed.

350
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,780
A utopia in its perfection would have to be authoritarian, because if you've already got

351
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,260
everything perfectly correct, there is no need to tolerate any more dissent, or debate,

352
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,140
or people leaving and going their own way.

353
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,500
All utopianism, regardless of political slant, is totalitarian.

354
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,580
And all political movements that believe in the march of progress, in this historicism,

355
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,380
that history has a teleology, is ultimately utopian.

356
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,420
The neo-reactionaries might reject this whole process, but I think they throw the baby out

357
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
with the bathwater.

358
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,940
For all of the ills of modernity, it's brought with it a lot of good.

359
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,460
So the question is, what's the solution to this problem?

360
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,240
Max Weber was a German historian and economist, founder of the field that would later be known

361
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,880
as sociology, and the inventor of the concept of methodological individualism, the idea

362
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,980
that individual motivations explain social phenomena, and that class dynamics are ultimately

363
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,200
just illusions.

364
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,620
This idea was accepted by neoclassical economists, Austrian economists, I think pretty much every

365
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,000
economic school other than the socialists, but it's not a purely economic idea.

366
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,400
Weber's interest was in the intersection of economics and history, and he is known for

367
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,660
saying, history consists of individual relations and events, and it is not the job of those

368
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,080
who study history to develop from it a social science or ideology to guide our way.

369
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,080
I think my view of progress is more in line with Weber's idea.

370
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,420
There is no end of history.

371
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,840
There is no destiny that human society must pursue at all costs, or resist at all costs,

372
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,040
as the reactionaries would have it.

373
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
There is no utopia that we can build.

374
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,800
History does not naturally trend leftward over time, or towards socialism or fascism

375
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,840
or anything else.

376
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,180
No movement in any direction, left, right, or other, can truly be considered progress

377
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,320
or regress beyond your own personal views.

378
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,560
A great example of what I'm talking about is this one article I came across coming out

379
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,260
of Minnesota when preparing for the Roe v. Wade tubcast.

380
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,620
I want you to pay close attention to the language used by the pro-life people in this article.

381
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,700
If the US Supreme Court were to throw out the Roe v. Wade decision, abortions would

382
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,980
remain legal in Minnesota due to a state's Supreme Court ruling back in 1995.

383
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,020
The ruling, known as Doe vs. Gomez, guaranteed the right to abortion in Minnesota, and required

384
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,600
the state to cover the cost for low-income patients.

385
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,500
In order for us to move forward here in Minnesota, we do have to get rid of Doe vs. Gomez.

386
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,120
Getting rid of Roe vs. Wade and then Doe vs. Gomez are going to be big steps in the right

387
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
direction for us to ultimately restore protection for unborn children in Minnesota, where, through

388
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,420
most of our history, the unborn were protected.

389
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,960
Even though the pro-life guy appeals to history, he also uses progressive terminology.

390
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
And I don't mean progressive in terms of the political group, but in terms of appealing

391
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,880
to progress.

392
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,020
He says phrases like moving forward and steps in the right direction.

393
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,520
Because ultimately, everybody views themselves as progressing towards whatever they want.

394
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,680
That's what progression is.

395
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,780
If you want food from your fridge and then you walk over and get it, the act of walking

396
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,360
is progressing towards that goal.

397
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,680
The word progress simply means what you desire.

398
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,520
And to make progressivism into a political school simply attaches a moral framework that

399
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
centers your desire as an a priori good.

400
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,860
By calling somebody regressive or reactionary for not agreeing with your desires, or by

401
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,540
worshipping your own theorized end state as a utopian progressive vision, all you're

402
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,720
doing is exerting control over other people.

403
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,780
That is what is at the bottom of all progressive views.

404
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,760
Progressors are good because they have the desire they have, everyone else is bad, and

405
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
that's that.

406
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,080
I just can't get behind any of this though.

407
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,520
I don't believe in the reactionary idea that the past was entirely better all the

408
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,360
time, we should implement any of the old systems.

409
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,940
But I also don't believe that progress moves in any one direction, regardless of what direction

410
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
that is.

411
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,880
And that people who don't want what I want are just evil.

412
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,520
I don't believe that any sort of utopia can actually exist at all.

413
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,960
I think if I had to call progress something, I would say that it moves in all directions

414
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
simultaneously.

415
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,380
It radiates outward, like ripples on a pond.

416
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,160
Progress is simply the next thing you do, and everyone's got a different next thing.

417
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,680
So a concept of political progress, a concept of progress beyond your own personal goals,

418
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
just seems useless.

419
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,080
In other words, if you're conceptualizing progress, you should only do so on an individual

420
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
level.

421
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,800
It's progress if you want to lose weight and then you lose 10 pounds.

422
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,860
If your conception of progress is political, if it involves colonizing the minds of others,

423
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,240
and forcing people to engage with your narrowly defined ideas of not only how your life should

424
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,280
be run, but how the whole world should be run, then I think you are automatically a

425
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
tyrant.

426
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,760
That's why all of these socialists and anarchists on the left are, to me, no different than

427
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,160
fascists in the end.

428
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,120
And frankly, same with the reactionaries too.

429
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,240
Not because they have the same ideas, obviously they don't, but because they all have an anti-individual,

430
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,960
hyper dogmatic view of the world.

431
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,840
They all think that they are the ones who know what a universal, perfect conception

432
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,400
of progress is, and they will absolutely destroy everything in their pursuit of it.

433
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,960
But for me, not everything is political, the personal isn't political.

434
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,560
There are things outside the bounds of the state, and ultimately, progress is personal,

435
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
not political.

436
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,960
In this way, the policies of government can't be framed as progress or regress, as revolutionary

437
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,240
or reactionary, and any such framing simply appears to be a power grab that relies on

438
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,640
this idea of the end of history, that there can be a utopian perfection.

439
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,880
It's no surprise to me that every single time we've chased it, millions of people have died.
