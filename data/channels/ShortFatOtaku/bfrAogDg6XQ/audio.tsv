0	12360	hello hey it's just me today no Lilith okay that's all right it's been a hyper
12360	17040	busy time for me and I basically only have like an hour or two tonight to
17040	22160	squeeze this in that's okay that's okay I appreciate taking the time regardless
22160	26000	and yeah I'm sorry for taking so long to getting back to you it's just things
26000	29960	have been rough right now oh it's everything all right sir oh yeah
29960	34800	everything's fine just very busy okay yeah I know there's there's a lot of I
34800	42200	was like the end of February I was laid off from my job but I found a job like
42200	45920	maybe about a month later so and I know I'm not the only one that's experienced
45920	51440	that so yeah yeah you've you've moved back to the States at this point yeah
51440	59360	sadly COVID I think ruined the economy a bit too far along so you know it being
59360	65080	able to make money is much easier to do than it was on the island so but the
65080	69800	good news is is that everything is pretty solid here I've got my own place
69800	74840	again and bought a car and cash so I can't complain so I mean same here
74840	78720	actually YouTube is doing well enough that I have a car I'm looking to get a
78720	83080	house like it might be yeah things might be okay at least for me yeah yeah you
83080	86080	and me both I mean like I've been waiting or following the market for
86080	91080	years now and it's like given that the interest rates are going up the price is
91080	95000	going to have to correspond with we go down I know we're in a bit of a strange
95000	98620	situation right now but that's the that's the goal because otherwise I'm
98620	103680	gonna have to build a cabin somewhere I mean with any luck it's gonna sound kind
103680	107760	of strange but with any luck there'll be another housing crash like in 2008 and
107800	112320	then the next generation of people can buy houses cheaper you know yeah cuz
112320	116760	like I had a friend of mine who ended up buying a house in like 2009 and he ended
116760	121000	up paying like $87,000 for it in st. Paul and now that house is probably
121000	127280	worth 300 so yeah it's like I yeah yeah you just sort of keep saving keep saving
127280	131640	and then yeah it's now it's like it's I'm priced out so what one nice thing
131640	136080	about being a youtuber is that you have a much higher ceiling it's based just in
136080	139240	your popularity right your popularity so there's some there's some luck
139240	143520	involved there's definitely some skill involved there's some charisma involved
143520	148960	so but it's not like you're you're at a job where you know your union contract
148960	152320	says that you get five raises over the course of ten years and that's it you
152320	156760	know what I mean exactly and and you know we can get into it with the comic
156760	160760	thing but yeah like the free market is a little bit carved up right now as it is
160760	164400	because it's rough out there but yeah it's good to hear that you're growing
164400	170280	and all that I mean I I the whole trans shooting thing I goddamn it's so many
170280	173440	people came out were like Liz you got to make a public statement or something I'm
173440	178120	like what are you talking about a public statement I'm gonna disavow a terrorist
178120	184600	like what is this about it's it's funny because you and I are both from that
184600	189740	previous era of the internet where you know you weren't online all the time you
189740	192840	weren't expected to be online all the time and you didn't have to give a take
192840	199080	on every single news story that hit yeah yeah but for some reason like every like
199080	205640	because it's a trans shooter and it's like I I have to you know what I don't
205640	208600	get I don't get people's mindset anymore I think people are just poisoned with
208600	214280	group politics so it's like what do you want I I don't identify with any of
214280	220200	these people they're they're crazy you know they're in a cult yeah so why
220200	226800	would I number one stick my neck out for me I know that I'm I'm basically a
226800	231500	broken record at this point but one big reason that I was a leftist in the early
231500	237520	2000s is because the left back then was highly individualistic and now it's not
237520	244440	it's yes we changed absolutely like I I used to be on the left as well too and
244440	250180	in part because the right had the the pearl clutching tipper gore variety type
250180	253620	that were always wanting to take away everything that I thought was cool I
253620	258820	love Dungeons & Dragons I left heavy metal I loved video games and they were
258820	263940	always like oh yeah well you can't have that you can't have that and it's like
263940	268220	well screw you I freedom is great freedom of speech is great and it was
268220	271980	what it was all about and now it's the opposite now it's you can't do anything
271980	276740	that that doesn't toe the line of whatever insane thing we've decided now
277140	283220	I mean in Canada we really didn't have quite the same level of right-wing
283220	289140	crazies that you guys did yeah I do I do remember watching like old spoonie
289140	292940	videos to bring it to bring it back to your era of the internet and your
292940	296820	section of the internet I remember watching old spoonie videos where he
296820	301380	would talk about the problems that he had playing like D&D and magic cards in
301380	305940	school and playing video games and I had the same issue yeah yeah I had my books
305940	311700	confiscated and by my global studies teacher who was convinced that I and
311700	316420	and like sat down with me is like is everything okay you talking about why
316420	319540	did you take my books away fortunately I had another teacher who was cool but got
319540	323260	them back for me because he was also a geeky geeky guy that played Dungeons &
323260	331140	Dragons but yeah yeah like like the 700 Club era you know yeah no no that was
331140	334100	very much a thing now granted spoonie Granite grew up in like you know
334100	337300	Arizona Utah and that kind of a Southwest with that but even up north
337300	341380	even up in a quote-unquote liberal state there were still teachers that were like
341380	345380	no well we have to confiscate you know any questionable material because it
345380	352300	might corrupt you somehow so yeah yeah for me basically I I just I skipped
352300	355820	school a lot I just played a lot of video games kind of on my own with my
355820	360620	friends you know mm-hmm I was never the guy to like bring a game boy to school
360620	364700	cuz I didn't want getting swiped by somebody else like a bigger kid so I
364700	368980	kind of but I still would like you know what I know that no one likes video
368980	372740	games and I got I definitely got teased and bullied for being a gamer when I was
372740	378100	when I was young exactly exactly that was taboo that was not oh and now and
378100	383620	now gamers are you know right wing right there right wing gamer gate Nazis now
383620	387980	that's what they oh it's like everything goes back to gamer gate and I know given
387980	391660	that the news cycle has made people have an attention span of like a fucking
391660	397180	goldfish at this point but gamer gate was a decade ago like are you guys gonna
397180	402380	get over it like at what point is this you know the I think that was just when
402380	407540	when I think that was the the first real time that anybody told them no yeah it
407540	413140	told them no and it kind of stuck you know cuz it it didn't really stick with
413140	418100	with comics comics game basically lost it didn't really stick with the
418100	421580	tabletop stuff because if you look at that now it's it's definitely been woke
421580	428620	a fine yeah yeah you know atheism became atheism plus you can go to you can go to
428620	433140	like old early internet rationalist spaces like the rationalist wiki now
433140	440620	sorry you know but but gaming I made a video on this a year ago my hypothesis
440620	447460	is that because gaming is inherently competitive there has to be some sort of
447460	451900	meritocratic aspect to it and that and that basically provided a bulwark
451900	456700	against let's say this sort of hyper woke stuff from really seeping in too
456700	460900	much and that's why if you look at you know really woke games they're walking
460900	464060	simulators and you know what there's actually some pretty decent walking
464060	466820	simulators like I'm not gonna like I like visual novels I like you know a
466820	470820	quick point-and-click games investigative games like there's there's
470820	476140	a place for those yeah yeah but uh man the people I don't know if you if you
476140	479260	saw this but like the Elden Ring discourse or people were complaining it
479260	484180	was too hard and then they framed it as an accessibility thing so it's like well
484180	488900	you're being you're being ableist if the game is right and it's like right what
488900	491940	are you saying about yourself that you're retarded like what's the story
492100	497260	here yeah well it's it's always that the standards have to be lowered and
497260	502260	everything has to cater to my whims yeah they're used to and that's that I think
502260	505980	is in part because of victim culture and you know it used to be that you
505980	509580	celebrated greatness you know the the people who are the top athletes on the
509580	515140	Wheaties boxes right or that was something to aspire to now it's it's the
515140	519580	opposite you don't get claim in accolades for being excellent you get
519580	527580	claim in accolades for being a wuss you know being a an ugly person instead of
527580	532020	being a beautiful person or being a mediocre person instead of greatness you
532020	536620	know but everyone's beautiful now yeah except they're not we know that's not
536620	542340	true yeah and in psychology and selective breeding and the rest of that
542340	547020	stuff yeah I mean try to you can try to push that all you want but you can't
547020	552340	bully men and going on the dates with you so that'll be the next frontier I
552340	556140	can't well that's what they look you know it's already here it's it's like
556140	560540	you you have overweight women saying that oh well it's it's fat phobic to not
560540	564540	going on a date with me and your beauty standards are based on a system of
564540	568500	oppression so I'm going to blackmail you into trying to it's like what are you
568500	573740	doing you're insane you're insane and you do you do see the same thing with
573740	577180	trans women too right where they say well if you if you don't if you don't
577180	581340	like the trans woman's dick that means that you're you're being trans phobic
581340	584260	and it's like well what if I'm just not into guys well she's not a guy it's like
584260	588180	okay I get your point but like I still don't want to have sex with a penis like
588180	591540	that's what a straight guy would say and that's completely fine but now it's
591540	596220	bigoted right or then you know Aiden Peledon actually did an episode about
596220	600580	that many years ago and and it was about you're not entitled to another person's
600580	605820	body yep right and that's that's what it amounts to that it amounts to is to I
605820	608940	want to have sex with you you don't want to have sex with me but you have to
608940	614460	otherwise agree because of reasons it's like yeah know that you you don't have
614460	620180	the right to enslave you don't have the right to another person it's ridiculous
620180	625380	it's like that's used to be but undergoing this path was a series of
625380	629700	opportunity cost choices where it's like you're yeah if you go down this road
629700	634980	even if you're post-op you will have a much reduced dating pool and at least at
634980	640260	the time that was something that people took into effect and they said well it
640260	644620	doesn't matter so much as I have to sort this out otherwise I'm not gonna make it
644620	650220	but now we live in a situation where anybody that has auto gynophilia or has
650220	653940	been sexually groomed or any of these other issues that are so far away from
653940	658460	the estimated one in a hundred and fifty thousand in men and one in a
658460	661940	hundred and three hundred thousand in women which is what the original numbers
661940	666980	were we're so far away from that that those original people have been
666980	674180	overshadowed by a order of magnitude by these new people that are degenerates or
674180	679580	abuse victims yeah well you're seriously like you're gonna be caught between a
679580	682460	rock and a hard place right because there's gonna be a lot of right oids who
682460	685980	would say that's what you are you're degenerate oh I've had that argument
685980	691340	many times I've noticed the the backlash towards trans people especially after
691340	696460	the shooting especially in the past two years you know you're seeing I'm seeing
696460	701900	a lot more of an adoption of left-wing mentality where it's group think it's
701900	707700	it's group this person is this therefore we judge them as that we don't treat
707700	711620	them as an individual anymore there's a movement away from the Goldwater style
711620	716340	Republican that was more libertarian mindset and more personal freedom
716340	721060	mindset and Liberty mindset towards collectivism and I'm seeing that on the
721060	725700	right they're adopting those tactics as well so they like you go on these I've
725700	728500	been around in some of these channels that where they go on these unhinged
728500	733060	rants it's like all trans people should be you know jailed or locked up or
733060	738380	institutionalized or thrown in a closet it with with a Bible and not come out
738380	742180	until it's like they're fixed it's like they're justifying their abuse because
742180	748100	it's you know it's it's reactionary and pissed off thinking and and it's like I
748100	751400	always do the the Grandpa Simpson meme where he's walking into the door of the
751400	754420	strip club and Bart's sitting there at the chair on the chair you know and he
754420	759380	just puts his hat on the rack sees Bart and then walks out and it's that sort of
759380	764780	thing and it's like yeah it's there there's very much that that thinking
764780	769380	and I've seen more and more of it but I think that's just as a it's people are
769380	772580	sick of this stuff there is no compromise there is no different
772580	775980	differentiation between the sex pests and people that are suffering from a
775980	781620	complex medical biological problem right there is no discussion about whether or
781620	788020	not this is Munchausen by proxy with children or whether or not this is
788020	792700	motivated by a corrupt medical industry that gets paid a ton of money to promote
792700	796140	this and if you trans a child you are guaranteed to have an income source for
796140	800220	for the rest of your life or their life there's no discussion about the ethics
800220	804700	of prescribing pymazide which is an anti psychotic that's used in treating
804700	809100	Tourette's syndrome which has been shown to be very effective in treating gender
809100	812860	dysphoria so those who receive it kind of lose that you know there's no
812860	817060	discussion about auto gynophilia or and whether or not this is a sexual kink
817060	822460	versus you know this is a a psychological need to like if it's not
822460	826100	met then then there's really no way out but there's none of this discussion is
826100	829860	going into it you either accept everything in anything or you are the
829860	833860	same moral equivalent of you know dragging a person behind a truck and a
833860	838380	gravel road right or throwing them in a gas chamber and people are sick of that
838380	843340	they're sick of this this this moral extortion game so this is what I've been
843340	847820	working on I've been I've been trying to do a video on everyone says you know
847820	852860	trans ideology or LGBT ideology you know well you know what is that actually and
852860	857900	I've I'm I'm not gonna make a statement on what it is yet I'm gonna wait for my
857900	861020	video to come out because I'm doing a lot of a lot of reading and a lot of
861020	866380	research but one thing that I've kind of unearthed is that there's a section of
866380	874780	the left liberals liberals like me you know non socialists non progressives
874780	878860	just just liberals liberals like me in the classical sense yeah yeah you know I
878860	883660	I was and still am completely on board with with the gay marriage argument
883660	887980	because it was it was an argument from innate biology it's like well you're
887980	892340	born gay or or you can't change being gay however you happen to become gay
892340	898180	right you can't change it you're born this way yeah yeah that's a biological
898180	904820	essentialist argument however the the constant affirmation you can self ideas
904820	908580	whatever you want that's completely against biological essentialism and what
908580	912620	I've as I've been like digging in and reading and looking through things I've
912620	919420	I've discovered that there is a section of a very radical component of the left
919500	928540	where they they never believed in the I was born this way argument they used it
928540	935220	as a tactical deployment to subvert liberals yeah and it's like oh it was
935220	938620	really I saw like that literature I was like oh that's very interesting well see
938620	942540	I view it I view this stuff as just Marxism with another coat of paint you
942540	947060	know Marxism is all about deconstruction and deconstructing established things
947100	952340	right so it deconstructs societal norms it deconstructs you know social
952340	957020	relationships and biology is just another front for them to deconstruct
957020	960940	right there is no such thing as gender as sex there you know like except there
960940	965860	is there are biological differences between the sexes there are you know
965860	972460	evolutionary pressures for that and like you said they've gone from a I was born
972460	977380	this way mindset towards human beings are complete blank slates and if that's
977380	981620	the case then you can then you're essentially supporting the get the you
981620	986060	know then you can pray the gateway right that that is a method that works if
986060	990900	we're just blank slates that are the victims of a authoritarian patriarchal
990900	996220	system that has subverted everything natural or right about ourselves then we
996220	1001140	can just create a brand new system from the top down and reprogram human beings
1001140	1005220	in any way we want and it but it doesn't work that way and it never has
1005220	1010540	worked that way I think what they like to rely on is the fact that you can't
1010540	1013380	really be objective which is true because we're all humans and we all
1013380	1017780	exist only in one location so none of us can actually be objective but they take
1017780	1022220	that to mean that there is no objective reality outside of any one human's
1022220	1026100	perception which is obviously false right right moral relativism is yeah
1026100	1030220	you know you know if if a hundred people look at the same thing and describe the
1030260	1033820	same thing there's probably something outside of the hundred people that
1033820	1038580	exists you know it's not just a hundred delusions that happen to line up so
1038580	1044140	right right right yeah even though we can't really truly access the objective
1044140	1048060	world and any because our senses are also subjective so we can't access the
1048060	1055220	objective world but it does exist and so basically a lot of the the biology the
1055220	1059460	philosophy the morality of a lot of these a lot of these people that say on
1059460	1063420	the blank slate left it completely falls apart because of that reason you
1063420	1067780	know what really I think as it's funny you bring this up because I think I
1067780	1073900	think how we got here to the idea that we're now calling women birthing
1073900	1080300	persons because is because in the leftist side that or at least the
1080300	1084980	traditional classical liberal mentality is that it's very much like a just you
1084980	1090820	do you and and you know live and let live in a lot of ways you know and I
1090820	1097020	think following most liberal-minded people's good nature it and I've heard
1097020	1102820	this myself I've heard you know talking to people like being post-op and whatnot
1102820	1108260	and and I'm like yeah I'm post-op trans post-op trans woman and then they'll
1108260	1113700	like like well I think you're female it's like okay well that's great but I
1113780	1119100	think that has gone to a such a degree where it's like no that person if they
1119100	1124740	identify as trans actually is that way and so when you do that that's where
1124740	1129100	they say well men can get pregnant too because the trans woman or trans man has
1129100	1135300	identified himself as being met a man despite having a womb and producing eggs
1135300	1141420	that doesn't make it's like yeah it's like the the open-mindedness has
1141900	1147340	resulted in people like having their brain fall out absolutely instead of
1147340	1151500	differentiating between a person having some dignity and saying okay fine you
1151500	1155340	know I will treat you the way that you wish to be treated it's gone to well now
1155340	1159340	we have to completely rewrite language and biology just to pacify a
1159340	1164620	statistically insignificant populace it's no fuck that yeah it's it's move
1164620	1169520	it's moved from treat other people polite to you must view them the way
1169520	1173040	that I want you to view them like inside exactly in the privacy of your
1173040	1179200	own head yeah right um so I did a video uh it was our trans woman actually woman
1179200	1182960	that was the that was yes I watched that I watched what you think of it um I
1182960	1189120	agree with you oh well thank you I do be honest it's not it's not all entirely my
1189120	1191960	idea um I got a lot of it from dr. Thomas
1191960	1195160	pagardas is paper on the subject if you read that or if you know what him I
1195320	1203000	don't know that one no okay um he kind of conception he conceptualized the idea
1203000	1207640	that because the definition is circular and then of course if you talk to like a
1207640	1210560	lefty they'll say what who cares the definite circle well it actually matters
1210560	1213000	that if it's just circle because what that means is that you can't actually
1213000	1218040	identify what a woman is you can't you can't point to a list of qualities that
1218040	1222120	woman refers to so if there's no qualities you can't actually have any
1222120	1226560	woman the woman can't exist which is why this is this is all they don't even
1226560	1231400	believe that trans women are women they simply use that to backdoor in gender
1231400	1235160	abolitionism right yeah yeah um but one of the things I pointed out in that
1235160	1240200	video was that um if we're talking about any other animal aside from humans we
1240200	1243960	talk about sex we're talking about gamete production we're not talking about
1243960	1247920	hormones we're not talking about we're not talking about chromosomes we're not
1247920	1250840	talking about social roles we're talking about gamete production and that's it
1250960	1257200	and we're also not afraid to point out that you have you know the male of an
1257200	1262080	animal and the female of an animal and then the neuter of an animal when for
1262080	1267080	some reason or another they don't produce any gametes mm-hmm and however
1267080	1272760	once you start talking about humans that that becomes kind of a spicy take when
1272760	1277960	you say well a trans woman who is post-op isn't male because they don't
1277960	1282000	produce small gametes and isn't female because they don't produce large gametes
1282000	1285760	they're neuter because they don't produce any gametes and even though
1285760	1290440	that's scientifically accurate you will get crucified if you say that right and
1290440	1294320	moreover too I can't change my chromosomes I also can't change my
1294320	1301600	skeletal structure or my morphic traits in my musculature so you know I always
1301600	1306960	I've been saying this now for ages but it's like you know I present myself as
1306960	1312120	female but technically under biology I'm not and that's not to say that you
1312120	1316640	can't respect me and treat me as female if that's what I choose to do but it
1316640	1321120	becomes a level of delusion if you try to suggest that yeah all it takes is
1321120	1324800	some some hormones and surgery and then we can go bango there you go and
1324800	1333080	moreover it's it doesn't it's this isn't helping anybody I think at the end of it
1333080	1340300	because encouraging this stuff even with trainees such as myself there is
1340300	1345000	it there's such an extremely high rate of suicide is still in the community so
1345000	1350440	if I were a moral person I would not want to be promoting this in any way
1350440	1355080	shape or form because I know that maybe inadvertently you create a social
1355080	1360240	disease maybe inadvertently you create gender dysphoria and when you create
1360240	1363520	gender dysphoria you are creating something that has a almost a fifty
1363520	1369400	percent suicide rate well if there is nothing moral or ethical about that if
1369400	1373080	you happen to believe that more trans people existing is good and less trans
1373080	1376880	people existing is a trans genocide then you actually might think that creating
1376880	1380160	more trans people is good and spreading gender dysphoria if it could be spread
1380160	1386840	is good what you're doing is you're creating more suicides though I mean
1386840	1391320	they don't care about that at the end of the day right that's the black pill
1391320	1394480	is that there's a part of the left that just doesn't give a shit about that well
1394480	1400440	yeah if I if I were a a conspirator really minded person I would suggest
1400440	1406520	that this is just yet another front towards the leftist mentality that
1406520	1411160	humans are a cancer on the world and they're they're trying to engineer so
1411160	1416800	that the birth rates further collapse you know if I were to to go down that
1416800	1420240	rabbit hole I think this is just yet another thing to try to get people to
1420240	1425080	not have children and reduce pop global population I don't know about that one
1425080	1429120	that that one sounds a bit far-fetched to me I honestly I think I think that's
1429120	1432800	happening you know fast enough without throwing this into the mix exactly I
1432800	1437800	mean you look at the gym you look at the demographics and in you know in 50 years
1437800	1441040	yeah the population is naturally going to fall off a cliff there's no need to
1441040	1445800	tinker with the birth rates or any of that when that's gonna happen naturally
1445800	1455760	so but it does seem a sense of nihilism or insanity behind it and there's this
1455760	1461000	is not motivated I think the trans ideology is not motivated by compassion
1461000	1466640	or empathy or kindness it's in it's motivated by entitlements self
1466640	1474680	righteousness money and greed this there's there's nothing compassionate
1474680	1479280	about it like I think if you were truly wanting to help somebody you would be
1479280	1482480	honest with them and you would have transparency and there's nothing like
1482480	1490200	that in this in this movement transparency not that that show that was
1490200	1498000	out there for a while transparent it was the guy from curb your enthusiasm I
1498000	1505680	think or no is the the the the dad character from what's that arrested
1505680	1515480	development he played a brands gendered parent and there was a drama show about
1515480	1519680	that man I so I've been recently watching house I haven't seen house
1519680	1524960	before okay sure and that was I think it started in what like 2004 2008 or yeah
1524960	1533000	yeah that was that was yeah before the 2008 collapse yeah yeah and there's a
1533000	1537920	few trans characters and a few like jokes at the expense of trans people in
1537920	1541720	that show man you couldn't say that shit on TV today or show what they showed on
1541720	1546720	TV it was it was funny as fuck but I'm like wow this I'm surprised it's on
1546720	1550960	it's still on like streaming services in 2023 you know what I mean like Jesus
1550960	1555600	it's it's so nefarious that you bring that up because I was listening to a
1555600	1560080	youtuber talk about how I think Jennifer Aniston was saying that you couldn't
1560080	1565360	make friends as a show anymore because of the cut kind of like 90s humor that
1565360	1569280	that exists you know like that that's not allowed anymore you're not allowed
1569280	1573560	like Joey the the guy on that show or he'd be he'd be homophobic and there'd
1573560	1578160	be you know a mass outrage and it was interesting because the people now that
1578360	1585520	are writing TV and cinema are because you know like Millennials or or Gen Xers
1585520	1589800	that grew up with that stuff and were you know laughing at it and having a
1589800	1594800	grand old time with it but now they're the ones that are saying oh well that's
1594800	1603840	not allowed so I don't yeah yeah it bothers me that we have very much of the
1603840	1608480	mindset of oh we have to judge the past on our current sensibilities and more
1608480	1612920	often than not that leads to you know iconoclastic ideas where it's like oh
1612920	1615960	well we have to tear down these statues because they're offensive to our
1615960	1620200	sensibilities now it doesn't matter they've been sitting there for for 150
1620200	1624360	years or they're a part of the history you know we've we've deigned them impure
1624360	1629000	they therefore they have to be destroyed just like this is yeah yeah iconoclasts
1629000	1633960	never are received well in history I've been so this is my good reason what to
1633960	1643880	because I recall hearing stories of my dad when he was in his teens and 20s
1643880	1648200	getting into hockey brawls he was a amateur hockey player yeah okay very
1648200	1652520	Canadian you know yeah yeah yeah oh very cool I'm gonna drink some molesons after
1652520	1659080	cool yeah but by the time I came along he wasn't that guy anymore he had kind
1659080	1666080	of settled down right yeah and I recall being like 10 or 11 and I'm at the
1666080	1670160	knock you know I was younger than that I would have been like 7 or 8 and we were
1670160	1674480	at the theme park and my dad really wanted me to go on these crazy
1674480	1677520	rollercoasters with him and I was too young to go and I was like I can't
1677520	1681840	handle this I'm way too young but then once I'm 16 and 17 we're back at the
1681840	1685800	same theme park and then my dad won't do it now he's too old nice old right
1685800	1689920	yeah and he's like well like my tastes have just changed it's like okay wait
1689920	1695600	and then now I'm thinking like well firstly my tastes now that I'm in my
1695600	1699080	30s my tastes haven't changed when I was in my teens or 20s I mean they changed a
1699080	1702480	little bit but like not much I can still like go back and watch jackass or
1702480	1707920	something or MX yeah you know those old with the edgy shows or um but I realized
1707920	1712480	that I think what's happened is basically a lot of people my age a lot
1712480	1717520	of the Millennials they had their fill of edgy content when they were younger
1717520	1722880	and now that they've grown up and maybe now they're they're a bit older maybe
1722880	1727360	they have houses or they have partners they have kids or they're they're in
1727360	1731960	they're in the workforce they're you know out of school by at least a decade
1731960	1736440	or more now they're like oh well now I'm getting older and I'm becoming more
1736440	1741640	responsible but I'm still a millennial because the millennial it's a phrase it
1741640	1747280	has like a certain weight to it you know yeah yeah well I've noticed that like a
1747280	1751440	lot of people and I'm also guilty of this to it some extent what do my age we
1751440	1755640	still act like we're the youngest generation but we're not anymore yeah I
1755640	1758840	don't know if it's with you but it's kind of psychological with me where it
1758840	1764360	feels like I'm still 25 and I'm not yeah yeah and I think a lot of the reason why
1764440	1769400	Millennials are they're basically discarding all the humor that they grew
1769400	1774840	up with in the 90s and the 2000s is because their tastes have changed as a
1774840	1779640	natural result of growing up and they think that all that all of society
1779640	1784400	should change with that because they're still the the youngest they're still the
1784400	1788360	center of society see I think I think it's something different I think it's
1788360	1793000	sort of a I see you'd mentioned certain milestones that they've gotten you know
1793000	1798040	they've had relationships or that they have of houses and families and jobs and
1798040	1802440	whatnot well Millennials are kind of the lost generation in that way
1802440	1808560	Millennials have a lower participation in the job labor force than Jen Z or
1808560	1814840	Gen Z does when it comes to a percentage of wealth owned Millennials have the
1814840	1819900	like the lowest by comparison to boomers and Xers which makes sense but even Gen
1819900	1823660	Zers have a little bit more wealth to it because fewer of them are going to
1823660	1829740	college and getting debt-trapped so what I think you have is kind of a quasi
1829740	1834500	state of arrested development for some and in others it's I don't actually own
1834500	1839300	anything the kind of work that I'm doing is you know unfulfilling and low paying
1839300	1845460	and I think maybe there's a sense of a strive for something greater as you get
1845460	1849420	older certainly you fill that hole with family and relationships and obligations
1849460	1853980	but if you can't actually achieve those milestones I think maybe it's filled
1853980	1861940	with with politics or this quasi sense of morality I kind of get that feeling
1861940	1871700	so well speaking of Millennials writing things yes what an excellent transition
1871700	1877860	or segue again there's that word again so last time we talked yeah you had
1877860	1882220	decided you you you opened up some sort of fundraiser was it I forget which one
1882220	1885740	it was was a go-fund-me or was a Kickstarter it was an Indiegogo actually
1885740	1891460	right okay sorry sorry yes yes yes you started up an Indiegogo for the first
1891460	1899340	issue of Linkara's your expert from a long time ago Lightbringer comic and it
1899340	1903420	was issue one yeah and the from what I remember the Indiegogo was going well
1903420	1909540	and I don't hit your goal right it's been funded so if yeah the and and I'll
1909540	1913820	certainly provide you the link to the but you but yeah we funded it the the
1913820	1918420	first comic is out there no way you haven't sent him a copy because I
1918420	1924700	suspect you'll just throw it away but yeah we were successful in it so yeah I
1924700	1931220	I do recall trying to find out what he thought of this well I was telling what
1931220	1935220	we thought about it and in fact that's kind of one of the motivators that we
1935220	1939900	have from one of the add-ons on this campaign well so okay so following the
1939900	1943900	change the channel drama that took place right there was a youtuber by the name
1943900	1949180	of V infuso and V infuso made a bunch of really good videos that that kind of
1949180	1952280	chronicled the events as they were unfolding and he spoke directly with
1952280	1959500	Mars girl obscures Luppa Ollie Brown the HR lady like he was kind of seen very
1959500	1964180	very well amongst that group so when it came time to kind of announce this this
1964180	1967380	thing I reached out to him and asked hey would you be willing to go like have a
1967380	1970340	stream or something that I can talk about it and just sort of catch up from
1970340	1973940	where we were at is from change the channel he's like oh I'd love to so we
1973940	1979820	have this stream and from what I understand somebody tweeted Linkara
1979820	1986660	about it Linkara then flagged it really and yeah he flagged it and I don't know
1986660	1990860	if he got a strike or not but he flagged it and then on Twitter he called
1990860	1997540	me a piece of shit so yeah I have the receipts I can dig him up for you but
1997540	2004740	sure it amounted to he apparently lost a lot of respect for me after I voted for
2004740	2010060	Trump and he went on this you know mean-spirited rant so seven years ago at
2010060	2017540	this point Jesus yeah yeah so we we we decided to kind of roll into that spin a
2017540	2024540	little bit so now we have make light bringer great again hats so we call
2024540	2031540	amalgam hats so one of the tiers we have is at the top there you know I just like
2031540	2035740	to so people have asked me so are you gonna send him one it's like again he's
2035740	2039260	probably gonna throw it away I know there's probably people out there who
2039260	2042700	would ask to have it signed at a con and would film themselves doing that I
2042700	2046860	certainly can't you know endorse you doing that or you know I'm not
2046860	2052180	encouraging you to troll by any stretch but I would like to see the the video if
2052180	2056700	it were to come out I'm just saying that does the car even go to cons anymore I
2056700	2062460	mean it's not that I don't know I'm easy well I don't try to follow him for what
2062460	2066340	he does a lot of the time anything any developments I get about his life are
2066460	2070060	kind of forwarded to me by third parties because again I can't ever really get
2070060	2075540	off the internet and I think or get free of the old stuff that I did I think
2075540	2080220	having realized that it's gotten a lot more expensive with the economy slowing
2080220	2084120	down and the costs have gone up as compared to last year I'm really
2084120	2087580	considering getting backing into streaming and or at least doing
2087580	2091260	something so that I can reestablish myself again so I don't have to you know
2091260	2095300	hop around on to other people's channels and just sort of get back into it myself
2095300	2100700	but yeah I know that he did some streaming and he people asked him about
2100700	2105700	oni plays and he got really upset about it you know they're always making fun of
2105700	2112220	me and you know he's just not Doug Doug Walker had a redemption arc and I didn't
2112220	2116660	think that was possible after the change the channel stuff so I got a respect for
2116660	2122820	it no mad respect for them for Doug he's he's he's managed to clause place back
2122820	2126940	on the internet and considering how he didn't die after the wall video it's
2126940	2132820	like the man's not human right like so good good for him so yeah but but
2132820	2137860	leycarra it just seems like I don't see it getting any better and yeah I wish
2137860	2141380	him the best I really do I'm not trying to hold grudges but he's he's turned
2141380	2145980	into this person that that is one of those types we were talking about so
2145980	2150880	yeah you know I mean it's it's so strange to think that like you know a
2150880	2155000	decade ago or I guess even more than a decade at this point yeah I really
2155000	2160320	looked up to channel awesome like I was a I you know the I told you the story
2160320	2164600	last time you were here but I'll recap it real quick just for the sake of this
2164600	2172680	video um 2009 I I really liked a VGN and I really really like spoonie and I
2172680	2176720	wanted to be on channel awesome so so me and my friends were you know running
2176720	2180080	around the suburbs with that with a with a camera shooting some really dumb
2180120	2185960	videos didn't really go anywhere yeah and then like I after the the angry
2185960	2188840	reviewer thing died off I did some let's plays and those kind of gained some
2188840	2192720	traction and I did some gamergate stuff and that gained a lot of traction and I
2192720	2196160	made friends with Sargon and I started doing politics and like yeah so I kind
2196160	2200560	of made my own way and and now like I'm I'm surprisingly bigger than spoonie
2200560	2203720	when spoonie was the guy that made me not not made me that sweet was the guy
2203720	2208760	that inspired you yeah yeah it's funny because like you can go back and watch
2208760	2213240	John Tron's from John Tron's first video and he's like spoonie inspired me
2213240	2217960	it's like damn yeah yeah and and now all these people are like they're kind of
2217960	2221800	it's it's it's it's really mean to say but they're kind of like washed up you
2221800	2225200	know or yeah yeah they've not really gained anything and I think that's one
2225200	2228440	of the biggest tragedies for the change the channel movement is that you saw the
2228440	2232840	main players of it and I didn't I guess I didn't realize this at the time but I
2232840	2237400	came at it as from an angle of yeah they did wrong but now that they've you know
2237400	2242040	like here's here's the various reasons why but maybe this is gonna be a good
2242040	2247040	lesson for all of us to kind of hold ourselves to a higher standard you know
2247040	2250840	now that we have the warning signs of abusers in our midst which is kind of
2250840	2254640	what the whole G Wario thing was as well as the management was maybe we're not
2254640	2258080	gonna tolerate this stuff anymore maybe we're gonna use this as an inspiration
2258080	2262120	for our own works and really strive to become something better but in reality I
2262120	2266760	think it was just another casualty or at least like a me too equivalency
2266760	2271440	because now now that it's been so far out there's another youtuber called that
2271440	2277120	the almighty lolly who did a good kind of breakdown of the document and said
2277120	2280520	well this isn't support there's no evidence for this claim there's no
2280520	2284300	evidence for this claim this is hearsay there's that this is one person's opinion
2284300	2288040	this is one person's like for me I had the receipts like everybody saw me get
2288040	2294340	my knee kicked in you know we when we posted the the the waiver they had a
2294340	2299740	sign for oh well we're not you if you get injured on site you know you you
2299740	2302660	know it's not our fault and we're not gonna help you because we have no
2302660	2306340	insurance and and you know yeah it's very easy to prove that they didn't have
2306340	2311300	filming permits for this stuff but that's all that you could like but yeah
2311300	2316900	so the fact that you were there you saw things and spoke to people and you can't
2316900	2320420	really reproduce that as evidence you know right and that's what I've said to
2320420	2324020	where it's like I'm putting my integrity on the line because I literally had I
2324020	2329180	can't prove that I picked up Juario's phone and you know trying to figure out
2329180	2333620	whose phone it belonged to it's it had a listing for my wife and my slave in it I
2333620	2338340	can't prove that so I'm going to come out of the woodwork and say well here's
2338340	2343060	what I've experienced I have nothing to gain from this and only to stand to lose
2343060	2347180	on this so if you don't believe me that's fine I get it but that was
2347180	2351900	actually that I had to do it in in my in the video I recorded today where
2351940	2356300	basically I had to point out that um if you if you go anywhere on the internet
2356300	2361340	it's just it's a slight side story it's okay if you go anywhere and you look up
2361340	2366260	the the phrase cultural Marxism okay you find that it's it's considered you know
2366260	2370060	an alt-right anti-semitic conspiracy theory and it's it's nazism in there
2370060	2376580	however you know I was in introductory to critical theory first year university
2376580	2381060	course in 2007 where the professor said that this was cultural Marxism and I had
2381060	2385580	a positive connotation and that is you will not find that on the Wikipedia
2385580	2389180	article not anymore you you could find that you know ten years ago in the
2389180	2393180	computer article not anymore not not not since Jordan Pearson started talking
2393180	2397220	about it on his on his YouTube channel you know in like 2016 or whatever it was
2397220	2402740	so you it's one thing that I've that I've been completely unprepared for as
2402740	2409860	I've gotten older is hat the way that like younger people or even just
2409900	2415380	uninformed people or misinformed people will come to me and describe to me
2415380	2422060	historical events that I was present for right with such like insane inaccuracy
2422060	2426060	like they're just they're so wrong and they're so sure of themselves and I'm
2426060	2432740	like I was there that's not how that was you know exactly exactly it's yeah yeah
2432740	2437220	you're right it there's sort of a weird reprogramming of events or just history
2437220	2440700	itself which is why it's so horrifying that even when it's as simple as
2440700	2445260	something with like a rolled doll book or dr. Seuss you know they they go back
2445260	2450180	and they try to change it that is so yeah that's yeah disgusting that's right
2450180	2457180	out of 1984 now I completely agree um when it comes to the the channel awesome
2457180	2460940	stuff I mean you know Doug still doing well Lindsay Ellis still seems to be
2460940	2465420	doing well angry Joe's doing okay really see I thought she quit the internet I
2465420	2469620	thought yeah she she got a contract with nebula and so she does content on nebula
2469620	2474020	now but for her yeah I'm glad to hear that yeah because I know the last time I
2474020	2478020	looked in her she she kind of she made an oopsie in her fans can't cancel there
2478020	2482940	so yeah well she kind of cultivated that like lefty can wall and base no kidding
2482940	2487660	you live by social justice you died by social justice so you know but she kind
2487660	2491020	of she left YouTube but she got a contract with nebula so she makes videos
2491020	2495540	on nebula now I've never heard of that thing so I don't know that nebula is
2495540	2499620	it's like a Netflix service where you pay monthly to get access to the videos
2499620	2503940	but it's for you total okay legal legal makes videos there Lindsay Ellis makes
2503940	2508260	videos there okay cool there's a bunch of creators that use it but I don't know
2508260	2511900	any more outside from those two but it is like a pretty decent stable of people
2511900	2519380	over there okay yeah I'll have to check it out I was yeah if it's well okay good
2519380	2523220	yeah every Joe is still relevant to and it's in some ways too but you know I
2523220	2528460	know like um Brad Jones he's he's kind of like yes grown but he hasn't really
2528460	2532300	shrunk he's just kind of been doing his own thing in his own sphere but like
2532300	2538660	aside from those four I think everyone has just collapsed like Linkara has a
2538660	2542700	subs and spoon he still has a subs and like the VGA guys they still have their
2542700	2546020	subs but no one watches their stuff anymore you know right their viewership
2546220	2553980	has gone down and I know that you know one of Linkara's and again there's a
2553980	2559540	youtuber by the name of Kinky Linky I know who Kinky Linky is yep yep yep and
2559540	2563340	he kind of chronicles some of the stuff but like there was a message that or a
2563340	2566660	tweet that that Linkara put out where it's like oh my history of the Power
2566660	2571500	Rangers made like $500 and oh yeah I'm totally not making it and I'm totally
2571500	2578380	poor ha ha ha ha I'm doing it but like the fact that yeah the Patreon amount is
2578380	2582700	really not gotten to like it's certainly not keeping up with inflation the
2582700	2587500	viewership has gone down I know we had to go to a dental college to get his
2587500	2591060	wisdom teeth out and you don't do that if you have dental coverage and right
2591060	2595380	you're like you don't show you what is dental college so the dental college is
2595380	2599060	okay so you go to a dentist to get your wisdom teeth out right you need an
2599060	2604340	orthodontist yet that right well dental college is just like that where if
2604340	2610180	you're an aspiring dentist or oral hygienist or or any of that stuff you
2610180	2614500	go there and you act as sort of like a practice guinea pig for the the learning
2614500	2618660	students and it's at a reduced cost of course because they're less professional
2618660	2624780	okay and yeah all right yeah yeah it's the sort of thing you do where if you
2624780	2630380	don't have dental coverage do stuff like that or if you can't afford the
2630380	2634580	painkillers afterward you you just take a bunch extra strength Tylenol right
2634580	2639260	like you can't afford the the Percocet or whatever it is they give you and the
2639260	2642620	big one for like I know this is a little bit old but like there was a point in
2642620	2646920	time where he shilled his fans for $7,000 to pay his taxes like a like a
2646920	2651220	few days before they were due it's like you're not in a good place if you're
2651220	2654500	doing stuff like that and I'm not saying that to be petty or spiteful
2654500	2658860	spiteful or vindictive despite everything Linkara does have a great
2658860	2665500	work ethic you know he does his videos on a very clockwork basis but at this
2665500	2670820	stage every and you probably know this as well too the youtubers really only
2670820	2674780	have three to five years of their golden years and then they just sort of are on
2674780	2678620	decline or they're struggling for relevance I think he should have gotten
2678620	2681980	off the wagon a while ago and just tried to find either work in the
2681980	2687100	industry or recommitted himself to more of a day job because at least in a day
2687100	2691940	job you have paid time off you have health and medical insurance benefits
2691940	2696900	you have a 401k stuff and you know your your rates are at least competitive to
2696900	2701700	the market so you're you'll compare pay rates five years ago where they are now
2701700	2705620	and they are higher because of inflation and because of other economic pressures
2705620	2709060	you really only get a pay rate if you can get more subscribers more viewers
2709060	2715860	or more patrons yeah and now easy to do I think that that's kind of true a lot
2715860	2719420	of youtubers do fall into that trap where they they go through a boom and
2719420	2722180	then they're now they have a bunch of subs but no one's really tuning in
2722180	2725260	anymore they're all dead subs and they're wondering like hey I have like a
2725260	2729100	500,000 sub channel how come I get you know five viewers a stream or how come I
2729100	2735060	get like a thousand viewers a video however I do think at this point
2735060	2739580	youtubing as a career has been developed enough that I think we know how to get
2739580	2743140	out of that trap okay what are your thoughts on it I'm genuinely curious
2743140	2747940	well you can you can see like you see guys like destiny for example or he like
2747940	2751340	reinvented himself every few years and that's kind of what kept him going you
2751340	2755980	know you look at yeah Sargon or red letter media they both decided to turn
2755980	2758820	like corporate where they started a company they got like a warehouse or
2759020	2763780	an office and they are they they actually reinvested it didn't just coast
2763780	2767780	that's how you get out of the trap is if you take you know oh you know a big
2767780	2771580	payday maybe you get like $5,000 or $10,000 in one month though it's a big
2771580	2777140	payday you know you don't party it up or you don't like cozy you have you take
2777140	2781340	that money and maybe you hire somebody maybe you try to expand your business
2781340	2786180	like there's there's get an editor yeah yeah yeah there's like I'm looking at
2786180	2790100	this this new crop of streamers who are coming up you know and they're all doing
2790100	2793380	that now like Chedlogic hired an editor yeah right you got like 500 viewers a
2793380	2796660	stream but he hired an editor and it's you know it's working out for him um
2796660	2801900	there's oh man who else who else could I name drop here real quick well yeah no I
2801900	2806300	agree with you that's that's what separates I think red letter media from
2806300	2810460	from channel awesome is that they did that they they don't what made red
2810460	2814140	letter media famous was the most little merciful planker revealer from our
2815140	2819780	he hasn't done a mr. Plinkett review in years and he's last year he did like the
2819780	2823420	how little Halloween mini skit but that's about it yeah you're right so so
2823420	2827420	he's that character is pretty much dead by all intents and purposes but he did
2827420	2833660	use that theme to create half in the bag to create several movies that they that
2833660	2839040	they released exactly all this other stuff that they do now a wheel of the
2839040	2843420	worst now they they've managed to grow it from you know certainly they invested
2843420	2847260	in their equipment the studios and they they have upped their game but if you
2847260	2850660	look at the quality of videos that when car is doing it's exactly the same thing
2850660	2857300	now as it was ten years ago so that's probably I think at some point you have
2857300	2863540	to stop doing the fight with yourself skits in your living uh-huh right or if
2863540	2867100	you're if your movie is gonna be you saving the world because what you do is
2867100	2872740	so important you know I I would love to see maybe not given the original comic
2873420	2877740	books creation but like if Linkara really did want to break into comics or
2877740	2881900	get into the industry he should have tried to develop his own comics years
2881900	2886860	ago and he or he should be doing what I'm doing and you know take either
2886860	2890220	light bringer or revolution of the mask or some of these other ones that he's
2890220	2895000	he's done and try to redo them to a more professional degree and see what he can
2895000	2901900	create he has the audience for it he has the you know he could raise it like I
2902140	2906420	don't have any doubt that he could hit the targets that I'm aiming for and he'd
2906420	2910980	probably actually be able to make some money off him too so it's a shame to see
2910980	2915900	him give up on his own IPs it's a shame to see him you know be this reviewer but
2915900	2920620	at the same time I do think it's something too smart to be said about
2920620	2924460	well if you can't create criticize and maybe that's the case if you're right
2924460	2928820	but that's not to say you can't improve everybody's gonna slam on light bringer
2928820	2934340	the original one or his his original fantasy novels but but remember that the
2934340	2939980	original light bringer was made in like what 2007 it's like 15 years ago you as
2939980	2948300	a writer could have grown by that point how old is he back in 2007 he's probably
2948300	2954700	gosh he's a few years younger than me so 15 years so probably young 20s or late
2954700	2959940	teens yeah I know that this point I'm a completely different person from where I
2959940	2963900	was back then literally and physically and physiologically as well too I might
2963900	2969140	add so the fact that you can you know if you have some of the the intellectual
2969140	2975820	humility to try to redo that yeah he was able to successfully raise $60,000 for a
2975820	2980700	movie why not try to create a comic again if you don't know how to do it
2980700	2985180	then then do the due diligence do the research treat it like a craft but
2985180	2989180	you're like you say you're never gonna stagnate and just do the same shtick
2989180	2993300	anymore it's like yeah I did you hit lightning in a bottle in 2010 but it
2993300	3000740	ain't 2010 anymore so yeah yeah oh man so actually there was a period of time
3000740	3006740	where I'd been confusing Linkara with what was his name
3006740	3011740	Kyle Callahan Oh Kyle Callahan yeah yes was that the
3011740	3017420	brows held high guy I think so I think so yes I think yeah this is gonna sound
3017420	3020620	kind of me but there's no real there's no real nice way to say it Linkara's
3020620	3025380	current girlfriend is that overweight black woman right that's his wife
3025380	3031380	actually wife now okay yes okay so Kyle has a very similar like looking you know
3031380	3037860	in shape kind of girlfriend okay and there was yes physique yes there was
3037860	3041380	actually a controversy I don't know if you remember this with Kyle where and I
3041380	3044020	thought it was Linkara till I had to like I'd like double-check but it was it
3044020	3052620	was Kyle um where basically he tweeted out that he hated his life he was
3052620	3058540	depressed about his relationship and his girlfriend has been forcing him to like
3058540	3064620	parrot her very progressive politics on his Twitter and on his channel when he
3064620	3069500	had a channel and that basic because like he had an obligation to make the
3069500	3072700	world a little bit better with with the platform that he had and that this was
3072700	3076900	this was one of the main reasons why he basically self-destructed and destroyed
3076900	3081860	his platform and he hated her for it and these tweets you know she put them out
3081860	3086620	they didn't really go viral because he doesn't have that reach anymore no one
3086620	3090100	cares about channel awesome anymore but people noticed and then they were they
3090100	3094340	were like quickly deleted you know mm-hmm and yet no over time that story
3094340	3099940	kind of morphed into Linkara but it was actually Kyle well two things first with
3099940	3104100	Kyle is that the the limited information or interaction I had with him he always
3104100	3108340	seemed like a very unhappy person I don't I really do have a lot of empathy
3108340	3112000	for him because having suffered from depression and I'm sure you've been in
3112000	3116140	your low points as well too you know it sounded as though he had some really bad
3116140	3120020	situations with some of the people he dated I think you know I don't want to
3120020	3123420	air any dirty laundry or anything but yeah he seemed like somebody that really
3123420	3127260	needed to kind of take a step back and re-examine where he was going so it's
3127260	3131580	not surprising to me that he tweeted that because yeah he was also very much
3131580	3136860	inundated with social justice when when it was still kind of getting started or
3136860	3141340	at least when I was noticing it which I guess are two separate things yeah the
3141340	3145660	other thing though with with so Linkara's wife that deep lore goes down
3145660	3153740	so okay the when I broke up with with Linkara we kind of or you know we ended
3153740	3159820	our relationship and I did that she was actually a superfan of his she managed
3159820	3166540	one of the tumblr accounts for it is this like that like an April von Lon
3166540	3171300	situation where like you don't don't hate the fans do not date yeah it kind
3171300	3176100	of is where but she she actually married him he married her I don't know I don't
3176100	3180980	know the specifics but she went to started going to he she figured out all
3180980	3184100	the conventions he was going to and started to kind of go to the same ones
3184100	3189660	that he went so she could kind of insert herself into this and that sounds yeah
3189660	3195340	yeah I had a mutual friend of mine that worked on a she worked as a person on
3195340	3201020	Linkara's production for his movie she also managed I think his Twitter she
3201020	3204060	she was connected with him and she did some work for him she was paid for it
3204060	3208820	too so but she was starting to warn him about her because she had something of a
3208820	3213980	double you know a public face and a private face and she was you know very
3213980	3218660	aggressive towards this this lady who was female and all that and she was
3218660	3221420	trying to warn him about it but he wouldn't really listen to it and I
3221460	3225860	remember meeting her for the first time she did like a size you up sort of look
3225860	3230060	and I thought that was really weird and I'm like and then she got really kind of
3230060	3235540	like PDA on Linkara and I'm like honey you don't need to worry about that I'm
3235540	3240260	not here to steal your man I'm not I'm just you know how many how many years
3240260	3246940	after you'd broken up was this oh gosh probably four or five it was a while I
3246940	3250580	mean it was beyond it was after my surgery it was it was beyond that point
3250740	3257700	and you know I thought that was really strange and again I don't want to go
3257700	3263860	into specifics just made like I should given how nasty he's been to me I feel
3263860	3267060	as though I probably should drag him through the mud a little bit but I still
3267060	3272540	think it's not classy to talk about some some stuff but regardless of the fact he
3272540	3277300	ended up marrying her they live together they do their thing I don't think they
3277300	3282580	get along well with or her parents approve of that situation I know his
3282580	3289860	when cars own mother is is she's very pro-trump and I think they don't speak
3289860	3296500	or on or are on good terms and some of the kinky-linky videos or people that
3296500	3299780	are kind of associated with that like there used to be a point and I've kind
3299780	3302300	of noticed this too like there used to be a point in time when we were dating
3302300	3305580	that he was very much like that he didn't want to be like oh I'm the
3305580	3309380	Christian kid or anything but he didn't swear willy-nilly he didn't he was
3309380	3313940	trying to keep it clean right he didn't go on the swearing tangents or whatnot
3313940	3319180	but that has absolutely changed I think since he got with Vega where he just
3319180	3325300	goes on these filthy sailor just f you and nasty mean-spirited rants about
3325300	3330460	people so that that didn't seem like his character back then so I don't know I
3330460	3336300	I'm not trying to psychoanalyze anybody but one of the reasons I ultimately
3336300	3340140	decided channel awesome wasn't for me was because people were living in these
3340140	3343980	egocentric bubbles right you get the feeling like if everybody's telling you
3343980	3347700	you're great and awesome and amazing you start to think your shit don't stink and
3347700	3351700	it absolutely does and you should have people that are calling you out for your
3351700	3354940	nonsense but if you label anybody that calls you out for your nonsense as being
3354940	3360060	a troll a hater or whatever you're you're you're giving your self an
3360060	3364140	excuse not to ever have any self-reflection or improve and I think
3364140	3368660	given his circumstances with his his wife I I get the feeling that there's
3368660	3374180	probably a lot more of that even worse going on so you know objectivity goes
3374180	3379740	out the window in that case so but it's a grass like I said the floor goes even
3379740	3386340	worse well actually I have one question and I'll cut I'll cut this part out if
3386340	3392900	you don't want it publicly so yeah but this is okay but still I'll cut it out
3392900	3399020	if you want it if you want to cut it okay no problem what considering that
3399020	3403300	Linkara's mother was you know very very Christian it sounds like and like you
3403300	3409720	know voted Trump and all that how did she react to you we don't know or I don't
3409720	3414760	know because here's what I'll say about Linkara's parents is they never ever
3414760	3420080	treated me any less than being very kind and equitable and friendly and supportive
3420080	3426680	and I'm I'm sure that conversation happened at some point and I don't know
3426680	3433440	when it happened but Avanel was nothing but kind to me and in fact the there was
3433440	3436480	there was a point in time when we were still kind of starting to date right or
3436480	3441880	just early in the relationship and his brother got bought a house he and his
3441880	3445120	wife bought a house and there was you know there's some old they needed some
3445120	3448040	help with some renovations there's this old disgusting wallpaper and I remember
3448040	3452640	having like this this like humidifier gun thing that you just sort of ran
3452640	3455560	against the wall that had a bunch of steam so it would loosen all the glue
3455560	3459360	and you'd peel it off really kind of gross and disgusting work right so I go
3459360	3462560	over there and I'm like okay well Linkara is you know doing a little bit
3462560	3466180	I'm like I'm not just gonna stand around and I'm gonna help you know so I
3466740	3471740	I go inside of this bedroom and got the the the thing to peel the wallpaper off
3471740	3477100	the wall and I remember talking to Avanel and she was very very friendly and
3477100	3481900	sweet to me she was very we talked about you know how I had an investment at the
3481900	3485980	time that was doing okay despite it being 2009 or whatever it was with the
3485980	3493580	economy crashed and you know she seemed very supportive now I don't know I don't
3493580	3497820	want to stick myself in because it's like we we've been not dating for so
3497820	3501260	such a long time but I get the distinct feeling that she does not approve of
3501260	3506540	Vega and that ironically she met with she would probably approve of me or did
3506540	3511700	approve of me back then I don't know but yeah definitively his parents were very
3511700	3515540	kind to me and I never had any reason like even back then before all this
3515540	3520620	stuff was mainstream that they didn't treat me like a decent person so okay
3520620	3525580	funny how that works that was just more for my own curiosity then well see I
3525580	3529540	would love to like reach out to her and be like hey you know if you want a
3529540	3533740	Malga hat or your here's your son's IP she might get a kick out of it and you
3533740	3538420	know I I get the distinct feeling even to this day we the two of us would be
3538420	3541420	able to sit down and have a great conversation and have a good laugh and
3541420	3548100	you know there'd be no problems there I don't I don't think at all so hmm yeah
3548140	3552300	great question though that's the first time anybody's asked me that do you want
3552300	3557180	me to leave that in okay okay okay that's kind of well it's kind of a
3557180	3561380	personal question it's up to you I don't care that much yeah well I mean you see
3561380	3565700	I've gotten more questions where it's like oh so how many times and Linkara go
3565700	3573180	down on you it's like I'm not it's saying any of that no but yeah it does
3573260	3578740	make me wonder about what that dynamic looks like but who knows yeah I'm sure
3578740	3586260	I'm sure as hell not gonna reach out so so yeah you are doing because late
3586260	3591380	bringer one was successful you're now doing light bringer two that's right so
3591380	3594900	so I'm not sure when this will get out but we are kind of on the last legs of
3594900	3600740	the campaign where we've we're about 70 as of this call where it's six or 78
3600740	3605860	percent there so last period last time we had around five thousand or so that
3605860	3608620	we were asking and if that's what we were asking for we would hit it but
3608620	3613740	because our costs went way up this year we were asking for 6700 so we're still
3613740	3617580	under that we've got about a week left to go so any sort of if anybody's
3617580	3623460	interested in this you know please please help us out if you if you if you
3623460	3628420	miss the first one we do have a digital catch-up for it we do have a limited run
3628420	3632780	of the first book and you can get the second book it with it or if you really
3632780	3637300	want to help us out you can back it with some some artwork or the the searing
3637300	3640500	light of justice tear which will have everything that we're offering in the
3640500	3647020	campaign with it so yeah no it's it's the campaign ends on the 12th right yeah
3647020	3651580	or it's six days from now so it's on the 11th on the 11th okay yeah yep since
3651580	3657300	next Tuesday from here right yeah this is coming out on Friday so okay yeah so
3658300	3661980	you have the weekend basically in like the Monday to to get in on this if you
3661980	3665660	want to so we'll see what happens I mean typically near the end of it we'll get
3665660	3669360	you know some last-minute people we might have a few more streams we can go
3669360	3674180	on to you know I think if we do get out where it's gonna be down to the wire so
3674180	3678900	so here's hoping knock on wood that we can because we've we've really upped the
3678900	3683020	game with this one we the art has gone up a significant notch we have a
3683020	3686460	different artist this time because the original artist had his own campaign
3686500	3691660	that he did and he got too busy so we had to pick up Dean James and Dean isn't
3691660	3696220	he's incredible so you know you can see some of the example pages that we've got
3696220	3702740	and yeah yeah so how we can absolutely get this going I'd love to see it be
3702740	3709380	realized so how how does it actually work like if you don't hit your 6700 do
3709380	3712540	you lose all the money or like what's the actual yeah it more or less gets
3712540	3717580	refunded back so they have they have two options right so they have it where
3717580	3721580	and this is where your reputation has to be sterling with it where you have two
3721580	3725060	options where if you don't hit your goal everything gets refunded in the washes
3725060	3729260	you have the second option where even if you don't get your goal you kind of keep
3729260	3733620	what you were able to raise the downside though is that that option has been sort
3733620	3738380	of abused by enough people where people are kind of sketchy if you are wary to
3738380	3742520	back that just because a lot of people or at least enough in the past took the
3742520	3746840	money and ran and never produced anything right so you know the last
3746840	3750120	thing I want to ever do is take people's money and then not produce anything
3750120	3753840	about anything I put my name on I want to have to be the highest level that I
3753840	3758640	can manage with it so I'm not sure we'll have to talk I'll have to talk with
3758640	3763800	Anthony my producer about it where maybe we can try to see if we can figure it
3763800	3769160	out a way to still do it or have it go to fulfillment or or what needs to be
3769160	3774160	done to we're very close we're less than 1,500 there so it's still within the
3774160	3778920	realm of possibility that we can get it through so all right well but yeah I
3778920	3782600	appreciate you taking the time and allowing me to shill my shit on your
3782600	3789200	street videos of course of course I mean I've listen I've as you know when I was
3789200	3793920	that when I was a youngster I really enjoyed the the channel awesome ecosystem
3793920	3799600	yeah and and now that I'm like it's it's never gonna be not strange that I'm
3799600	3803480	bigger than some of my heroes when I was younger you know it's always gonna be a
3803480	3809280	weird feeling so yeah and you never know I maybe one day I can get back up on
3809280	3814440	that horse I do have other projects I'm working on you know part of the part of
3814440	3821480	the the homework I put for myself was to up my writing style or my skill in it so
3821480	3829080	I started I've been working on some TV TV pilot episodes I've a friend of mine
3829080	3833360	and I are working on a movie script too so you know I'm not saying it'll amount
3833360	3838800	to anything but I am trying to still chase that skill set so that what if and
3838800	3843600	when opportunity strikes I'll be ready so yeah and you know you could always
3843600	3848320	just play you could always just play your identity go to Hollywood you're
3848320	3853760	trans you'll get right in there I mean yeah it's it's about who you know so
3853760	3858420	yeah yeah it is nice to be to refer to myself though is like an established
3858420	3862440	writer though I were you we were an author I got like bringer one out there
3862440	3869960	and I see this thing as a as a 24 issue arc or season like this whole thing that
3869960	3874240	I have in my mind definitely this first story is gonna be a three-parter so we I
3874240	3878400	come hell or high water even if we can't get it done and it turns into a
3878400	3882480	vanity project I still want to do it because the last one of my personal
3882480	3885800	failings in the channel awesome day was that I would start things and not finish
3885800	3891080	them so even if it cost me money even if I don't make any money off of it I still
3891080	3895920	believe enough in light bringer just to want to see it shine so yeah yeah I know
3895920	3901680	exactly you know I mm-hmm I've man when I was you know in high school I was like
3901680	3906040	programming video games always wanted to make my own games ended up you know
3906040	3910080	that got swept away just by life because like I went through so many just other
3910080	3914640	phases of what I was doing but man if I could get to like a million subs on
3914640	3918800	YouTube who knows if I don't happen but if it did I would definitely reroute
3918800	3923000	some of that some of that income into like making a game I would love to
3923000	3927840	actually make a video game you know absolutely that'd be the dream well
3927880	3935400	but uh you know V is V yeah yeah the Romanian guy V yeah yeah yeah oh he is
3935400	3941040	yeah yeah yeah well he's that he's now making a game oh good for him yeah he's
3941040	3943520	he's managed to pull it off and I'm like damn you're doing what I've always
3943520	3947640	wanted to do yeah I mean if I had to choose anything that I would love to do
3947640	3952120	that would be like a passion project it would be to do a battle tech TV show TV
3952120	3956800	show and I have two these are the projects or several of them that I would
3956800	3960640	be that I've been working on and the first one would be like set in the
3960640	3963760	fourth secession war and all that stuff and the second one would be set in the
3963760	3967840	periphery following a mercenary company and you could set it up as like a you'd
3967840	3974400	pitch it as a Game of Thrones but in space so all the fun jazz that you can
3974400	3977080	do with that you can have action if you wanted it you could have intrigue if you
3977080	3980400	wanted it you could there's so many things you can do with it but that would
3980400	3985900	that would be my rolling you know a lucky seven or just rolling a natural 20
3985900	3995260	how about that analogy if I could do that I would die a happy person so well
3995260	3998900	okay I think we might have run out of topics to a talk about and also I only
3998900	4004500	have 15 more minutes before I have to go yeah well here's the thing well here's
4004500	4007740	something that's interesting here I'll go back to more channel awesome one last
4007740	4014540	time to the channel awesome well of course because no offense to Brad Jones
4014540	4018740	I love his stuff but he's he's kind of stagnated a bit I've decided to try to
4018740	4023700	do the midnight screening format okay well you know you hop into a van or you
4023700	4028660	hop into a car and yeah you go talk about it yeah yeah and you're and you
4028660	4033260	know I've done it a few times now and it's actually kind of it's very um not
4033260	4038340	spooky here you know the liminal space is bought it's very liminal yes all
4038340	4043580	right okay okay cuz you're sitting in a car in the middle of an empty parking
4043580	4048300	lot everyone is gone the city is just dead quiet and you're talking about a
4048300	4052420	movie at 3 a.m. you know it's a very strange it's very fun I know what you're
4052420	4056480	talking about yeah yeah that was one of the downsides of working the the
4056480	4060300	reviewer stuff that we did where you know when Cara would shoot shows at like
4060300	4063780	1 in the morning and then we'd go out for grocery shopping at 3 and it's like
4063780	4068860	yeah everybody's asleep right it's this weird yeah that made me wonder about
4068860	4072660	that that idea always sort of stuck with me if you were a vampire right where
4072660	4075620	you'd see all these stores that you would never be able to go into because
4075620	4080500	they're closed when you're active so yeah it is a weird liminal feeling it's
4080500	4087380	a very surreal experience it lets the mind wander so yeah I like that kind of
4087380	4091300	insomnia horror where it's stuff like that that actually reminds me of
4091300	4097840	something uh okay so it's the as I mentioned at the start of this what I
4097840	4100780	started with was anime reviews it was me and two friends running around with a
4100780	4104380	camera we were we were young and stupid and we wanted to join channel awesome
4104380	4108300	and never did wait I did tell you the story where I got accepted and then
4108300	4113060	rejected them right yes yes yeah that was like in 2014 or something that was
4113060	4118020	just for fun but um so 2009 we're we're being dumb we're making anime reviews
4118020	4125180	um however two out of the three of us were only back in my hometown for for
4125180	4129020	one summer right okay had to so we had to like write all the scripts and shoot
4129020	4132580	all of the live-action parts of the episodes over the course of the summer
4132580	4137500	and then we would like edit them over the year right so yeah yeah shot like a
4137500	4140900	whole bunch of episodes we had it all planned out it was very it was very
4140900	4143860	ambitious for our very first project doing this together yeah but we did it
4143860	4149940	and we got to the point where we had released so we shot everything in that
4149940	4154060	summer and then we started releasing it in the fall in the winter and the spring
4154060	4157620	it was very strange shooting the Christmas episode in like July because
4157620	4161260	we were just sweltering but we had you're like you're like pretending to be
4161260	4164460	cold like wearing robes and like shivering looking out a window and we
4164460	4170140	cut we would cut in like snow later but like it was so hot but the final episode
4170140	4176540	of the season we realized we didn't have some of the shots that we needed oh crap
4176540	4183340	so and and at this point the third person had moved away he had moved out
4183340	4187340	of his parents house we shot the show because two of us were coming to town
4187380	4191500	for seasonal work and the third guy lived there and he was still he was
4191500	4195140	still he was still living with it with his um his um his parents right yeah
4195140	4200340	yeah he hadn't gone to school yet but basically what was going on was his
4200340	4204540	parents because they they have a boat so they would go Friday to Sunday every
4204540	4207180	weekend they'd go on the boat and they'd you know boat around the Great Lakes
4207180	4211900	because they yep that was nothing um yeah so he always had he hadn't he had
4211900	4215460	so much time alone so we would like every weekend we would redecorate his
4216180	4220820	his living room to be the set of the show and then we put it back but before
4220820	4223820	his parents got home because his parents did not approve they really didn't
4223820	4230060	approve um okay it was really fun sneak around it was probably not very good but
4230060	4234140	it was fun um yeah but it's part of the experience it is yeah it is I'm sure
4234140	4238100	like to do I'm sure if you know you probably have some gorilla filmmaking
4238100	4242180	experiences that are kind of like this oh yeah yeah yes so we got to a point
4242260	4246900	where we were putting out the final episode and we realized we just we were
4246900	4250060	missing some key shots like it just wouldn't work and at this point he had
4250060	4255300	moved away so we decided to go back to our home to his hometown and break into
4255300	4260780	his parents house I was just about to say yeah break in yes we did we knew
4260780	4265100	where the hidden key was we broke in we like oh my god we we set that we set
4265100	4269680	everything up we shot the shots that we needed we filmed from like 1 a.m. to
4269720	4272800	like 5 a.m. because we just didn't want anyone to see us coming in they're
4272800	4277600	really nosy neighbors the whole thing so broken we uh when we left we like took
4277600	4280960	all of our garbage with us we didn't leave a single trace of anything we put
4280960	4287720	everything back exactly and then we went back to like my parents house so oh god
4287720	4291960	that's a fantastic story yeah and then he didn't tell his parents for like like
4292000	4298560	I think seven or eight years that we had done that you broke into your that's
4298560	4303240	great yeah it was fun do when you're following what you want to do yeah and I
4303240	4307160	think anyone who's done any sort of like small project gorilla filmmaking knows
4307160	4311360	exactly the kind of feeling I'm talking about exactly that was that was filming
4311360	4316280	to boldly or suburban nights where you know they don't have permits to any of
4316280	4320400	this we're walking around in the in the park and all that you know it it's just
4320400	4325120	okay that's what you have to do running across the the goose shit-covered fields
4325120	4329040	and yeah it's like alright hope that no one like calls the cops and you or hope
4329040	4333960	no one shows up to tell you to move on exactly exactly did that ever happen to
4333960	4336680	just did he ever get like you ever get in trouble doing that did anyone ever
4336680	4341000	show no no the police are well the police in Chicago I'm sure have better
4341000	4346200	things to do but that's you know there were several times though where it's
4346200	4349080	like okay we have to stop what we're doing because there are people going
4349240	4354640	through right and it's one of the criticisms of dog is like oh there was a
4354640	4358560	random people that walked by and he was trying to give them like no no don't do
4358560	4363040	that walk through like this I'm giving you stage no from my experience on that
4363040	4369040	on that shoot we were filming in a couple parks around I think it was
4369040	4373000	around Easter so a lot of people were out and about and it was super wet and
4373000	4376960	soggy because you know the reason we were on such a tight film schedules
4376960	4382200	because we got rained out for a couple days so it is that sort of thing where
4382200	4386440	you know art through adversity a little bit which is where people were feeling
4386440	4391240	with that shoot but the next one not so much but yeah we never got we never got
4391240	4395360	thrown out for anything but I think that we did hop the chain fence to get inside
4395360	4401680	of one of the parks early in the morning before it opened so yeah yeah um hey
4401680	4405520	that was just a strange side what I actually wanted to bring up is that I've
4405560	4409200	decided to start doing um the midnight screenings because I wanted to
4409200	4411760	experience what it was like and that was always that was always like the show
4411760	4415960	that I really tuned in for Brad Jones was that was minutes I loved the
