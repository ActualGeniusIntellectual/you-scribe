1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,360
hello hey it's just me today no Lilith okay that's all right it's been a hyper

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,040
busy time for me and I basically only have like an hour or two tonight to

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,160
squeeze this in that's okay that's okay I appreciate taking the time regardless

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,000
and yeah I'm sorry for taking so long to getting back to you it's just things

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,960
have been rough right now oh it's everything all right sir oh yeah

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,800
everything's fine just very busy okay yeah I know there's there's a lot of I

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,200
was like the end of February I was laid off from my job but I found a job like

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,920
maybe about a month later so and I know I'm not the only one that's experienced

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,440
that so yeah yeah you've you've moved back to the States at this point yeah

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,360
sadly COVID I think ruined the economy a bit too far along so you know it being

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,080
able to make money is much easier to do than it was on the island so but the

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,800
good news is is that everything is pretty solid here I've got my own place

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,840
again and bought a car and cash so I can't complain so I mean same here

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,720
actually YouTube is doing well enough that I have a car I'm looking to get a

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,080
house like it might be yeah things might be okay at least for me yeah yeah you

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
and me both I mean like I've been waiting or following the market for

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
years now and it's like given that the interest rates are going up the price is

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,000
going to have to correspond with we go down I know we're in a bit of a strange

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,620
situation right now but that's the that's the goal because otherwise I'm

20
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,680
gonna have to build a cabin somewhere I mean with any luck it's gonna sound kind

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,760
of strange but with any luck there'll be another housing crash like in 2008 and

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,320
then the next generation of people can buy houses cheaper you know yeah cuz

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,760
like I had a friend of mine who ended up buying a house in like 2009 and he ended

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,000
up paying like $87,000 for it in st. Paul and now that house is probably

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,280
worth 300 so yeah it's like I yeah yeah you just sort of keep saving keep saving

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,640
and then yeah it's now it's like it's I'm priced out so what one nice thing

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,080
about being a youtuber is that you have a much higher ceiling it's based just in

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,240
your popularity right your popularity so there's some there's some luck

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,520
involved there's definitely some skill involved there's some charisma involved

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,960
so but it's not like you're you're at a job where you know your union contract

31
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,320
says that you get five raises over the course of ten years and that's it you

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,760
know what I mean exactly and and you know we can get into it with the comic

33
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,760
thing but yeah like the free market is a little bit carved up right now as it is

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,400
because it's rough out there but yeah it's good to hear that you're growing

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,280
and all that I mean I I the whole trans shooting thing I goddamn it's so many

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,440
people came out were like Liz you got to make a public statement or something I'm

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,120
like what are you talking about a public statement I'm gonna disavow a terrorist

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,600
like what is this about it's it's funny because you and I are both from that

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,740
previous era of the internet where you know you weren't online all the time you

40
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,840
weren't expected to be online all the time and you didn't have to give a take

41
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,080
on every single news story that hit yeah yeah but for some reason like every like

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,640
because it's a trans shooter and it's like I I have to you know what I don't

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,600
get I don't get people's mindset anymore I think people are just poisoned with

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,280
group politics so it's like what do you want I I don't identify with any of

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,200
these people they're they're crazy you know they're in a cult yeah so why

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,800
would I number one stick my neck out for me I know that I'm I'm basically a

47
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,500
broken record at this point but one big reason that I was a leftist in the early

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,520
2000s is because the left back then was highly individualistic and now it's not

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,440
it's yes we changed absolutely like I I used to be on the left as well too and

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,180
in part because the right had the the pearl clutching tipper gore variety type

51
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,620
that were always wanting to take away everything that I thought was cool I

52
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,820
love Dungeons & Dragons I left heavy metal I loved video games and they were

53
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,940
always like oh yeah well you can't have that you can't have that and it's like

54
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,220
well screw you I freedom is great freedom of speech is great and it was

55
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,980
what it was all about and now it's the opposite now it's you can't do anything

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,740
that that doesn't toe the line of whatever insane thing we've decided now

57
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,220
I mean in Canada we really didn't have quite the same level of right-wing

58
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,140
crazies that you guys did yeah I do I do remember watching like old spoonie

59
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,940
videos to bring it to bring it back to your era of the internet and your

60
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,820
section of the internet I remember watching old spoonie videos where he

61
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,380
would talk about the problems that he had playing like D&D and magic cards in

62
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,940
school and playing video games and I had the same issue yeah yeah I had my books

63
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,700
confiscated and by my global studies teacher who was convinced that I and

64
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,420
and like sat down with me is like is everything okay you talking about why

65
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,540
did you take my books away fortunately I had another teacher who was cool but got

66
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,260
them back for me because he was also a geeky geeky guy that played Dungeons &

67
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:31,140
Dragons but yeah yeah like like the 700 Club era you know yeah no no that was

68
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,100
very much a thing now granted spoonie Granite grew up in like you know

69
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,300
Arizona Utah and that kind of a Southwest with that but even up north

70
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,380
even up in a quote-unquote liberal state there were still teachers that were like

71
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,380
no well we have to confiscate you know any questionable material because it

72
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,300
might corrupt you somehow so yeah yeah for me basically I I just I skipped

73
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,820
school a lot I just played a lot of video games kind of on my own with my

74
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,620
friends you know mm-hmm I was never the guy to like bring a game boy to school

75
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,700
cuz I didn't want getting swiped by somebody else like a bigger kid so I

76
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,980
kind of but I still would like you know what I know that no one likes video

77
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,740
games and I got I definitely got teased and bullied for being a gamer when I was

78
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,100
when I was young exactly exactly that was taboo that was not oh and now and

79
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,620
now gamers are you know right wing right there right wing gamer gate Nazis now

80
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,980
that's what they oh it's like everything goes back to gamer gate and I know given

81
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,660
that the news cycle has made people have an attention span of like a fucking

82
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,180
goldfish at this point but gamer gate was a decade ago like are you guys gonna

83
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,380
get over it like at what point is this you know the I think that was just when

84
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,540
when I think that was the the first real time that anybody told them no yeah it

85
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,140
told them no and it kind of stuck you know cuz it it didn't really stick with

86
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,100
with comics comics game basically lost it didn't really stick with the

87
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,580
tabletop stuff because if you look at that now it's it's definitely been woke

88
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:08,620
a fine yeah yeah you know atheism became atheism plus you can go to you can go to

89
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,140
like old early internet rationalist spaces like the rationalist wiki now

90
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,620
sorry you know but but gaming I made a video on this a year ago my hypothesis

91
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:27,460
is that because gaming is inherently competitive there has to be some sort of

92
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,900
meritocratic aspect to it and that and that basically provided a bulwark

93
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,700
against let's say this sort of hyper woke stuff from really seeping in too

94
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,900
much and that's why if you look at you know really woke games they're walking

95
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,060
simulators and you know what there's actually some pretty decent walking

96
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,820
simulators like I'm not gonna like I like visual novels I like you know a

97
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,820
quick point-and-click games investigative games like there's there's

98
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,140
a place for those yeah yeah but uh man the people I don't know if you if you

99
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,260
saw this but like the Elden Ring discourse or people were complaining it

100
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,180
was too hard and then they framed it as an accessibility thing so it's like well

101
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,900
you're being you're being ableist if the game is right and it's like right what

102
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,940
are you saying about yourself that you're retarded like what's the story

103
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,260
here yeah well it's it's always that the standards have to be lowered and

104
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,260
everything has to cater to my whims yeah they're used to and that's that I think

105
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,980
is in part because of victim culture and you know it used to be that you

106
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,580
celebrated greatness you know the the people who are the top athletes on the

107
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,140
Wheaties boxes right or that was something to aspire to now it's it's the

108
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,580
opposite you don't get claim in accolades for being excellent you get

109
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:47,580
claim in accolades for being a wuss you know being a an ugly person instead of

110
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,020
being a beautiful person or being a mediocre person instead of greatness you

111
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,620
know but everyone's beautiful now yeah except they're not we know that's not

112
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,340
true yeah and in psychology and selective breeding and the rest of that

113
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,020
stuff yeah I mean try to you can try to push that all you want but you can't

114
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,340
bully men and going on the dates with you so that'll be the next frontier I

115
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,140
can't well that's what they look you know it's already here it's it's like

116
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,540
you you have overweight women saying that oh well it's it's fat phobic to not

117
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,540
going on a date with me and your beauty standards are based on a system of

118
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,500
oppression so I'm going to blackmail you into trying to it's like what are you

119
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,740
doing you're insane you're insane and you do you do see the same thing with

120
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,180
trans women too right where they say well if you if you don't if you don't

121
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,340
like the trans woman's dick that means that you're you're being trans phobic

122
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,260
and it's like well what if I'm just not into guys well she's not a guy it's like

123
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,180
okay I get your point but like I still don't want to have sex with a penis like

124
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,540
that's what a straight guy would say and that's completely fine but now it's

125
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,220
bigoted right or then you know Aiden Peledon actually did an episode about

126
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,580
that many years ago and and it was about you're not entitled to another person's

127
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,820
body yep right and that's that's what it amounts to that it amounts to is to I

128
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,940
want to have sex with you you don't want to have sex with me but you have to

129
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,460
otherwise agree because of reasons it's like yeah know that you you don't have

130
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,180
the right to enslave you don't have the right to another person it's ridiculous

131
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,380
it's like that's used to be but undergoing this path was a series of

132
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,700
opportunity cost choices where it's like you're yeah if you go down this road

133
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,980
even if you're post-op you will have a much reduced dating pool and at least at

134
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,260
the time that was something that people took into effect and they said well it

135
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,620
doesn't matter so much as I have to sort this out otherwise I'm not gonna make it

136
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,220
but now we live in a situation where anybody that has auto gynophilia or has

137
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,940
been sexually groomed or any of these other issues that are so far away from

138
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,460
the estimated one in a hundred and fifty thousand in men and one in a

139
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,940
hundred and three hundred thousand in women which is what the original numbers

140
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,980
were we're so far away from that that those original people have been

141
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,180
overshadowed by a order of magnitude by these new people that are degenerates or

142
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,580
abuse victims yeah well you're seriously like you're gonna be caught between a

143
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,460
rock and a hard place right because there's gonna be a lot of right oids who

144
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,980
would say that's what you are you're degenerate oh I've had that argument

145
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,340
many times I've noticed the the backlash towards trans people especially after

146
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,460
the shooting especially in the past two years you know you're seeing I'm seeing

147
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,900
a lot more of an adoption of left-wing mentality where it's group think it's

148
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,700
it's group this person is this therefore we judge them as that we don't treat

149
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,620
them as an individual anymore there's a movement away from the Goldwater style

150
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,340
Republican that was more libertarian mindset and more personal freedom

151
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,060
mindset and Liberty mindset towards collectivism and I'm seeing that on the

152
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,700
right they're adopting those tactics as well so they like you go on these I've

153
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,500
been around in some of these channels that where they go on these unhinged

154
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,060
rants it's like all trans people should be you know jailed or locked up or

155
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,380
institutionalized or thrown in a closet it with with a Bible and not come out

156
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,180
until it's like they're fixed it's like they're justifying their abuse because

157
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:28,100
it's you know it's it's reactionary and pissed off thinking and and it's like I

158
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,400
always do the the Grandpa Simpson meme where he's walking into the door of the

159
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,420
strip club and Bart's sitting there at the chair on the chair you know and he

160
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,380
just puts his hat on the rack sees Bart and then walks out and it's that sort of

161
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,780
thing and it's like yeah it's there there's very much that that thinking

162
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,380
and I've seen more and more of it but I think that's just as a it's people are

163
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,580
sick of this stuff there is no compromise there is no different

164
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,980
differentiation between the sex pests and people that are suffering from a

165
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,620
complex medical biological problem right there is no discussion about whether or

166
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:08,020
not this is Munchausen by proxy with children or whether or not this is

167
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,700
motivated by a corrupt medical industry that gets paid a ton of money to promote

168
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,140
this and if you trans a child you are guaranteed to have an income source for

169
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,220
for the rest of your life or their life there's no discussion about the ethics

170
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,700
of prescribing pymazide which is an anti psychotic that's used in treating

171
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,100
Tourette's syndrome which has been shown to be very effective in treating gender

172
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,860
dysphoria so those who receive it kind of lose that you know there's no

173
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,060
discussion about auto gynophilia or and whether or not this is a sexual kink

174
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,460
versus you know this is a a psychological need to like if it's not

175
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,100
met then then there's really no way out but there's none of this discussion is

176
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,860
going into it you either accept everything in anything or you are the

177
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,860
same moral equivalent of you know dragging a person behind a truck and a

178
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,380
gravel road right or throwing them in a gas chamber and people are sick of that

179
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,340
they're sick of this this this moral extortion game so this is what I've been

180
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,820
working on I've been I've been trying to do a video on everyone says you know

181
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,860
trans ideology or LGBT ideology you know well you know what is that actually and

182
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,900
I've I'm I'm not gonna make a statement on what it is yet I'm gonna wait for my

183
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,020
video to come out because I'm doing a lot of a lot of reading and a lot of

184
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,380
research but one thing that I've kind of unearthed is that there's a section of

185
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:34,780
the left liberals liberals like me you know non socialists non progressives

186
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,860
just just liberals liberals like me in the classical sense yeah yeah you know I

187
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,660
I was and still am completely on board with with the gay marriage argument

188
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,980
because it was it was an argument from innate biology it's like well you're

189
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,340
born gay or or you can't change being gay however you happen to become gay

190
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,180
right you can't change it you're born this way yeah yeah that's a biological

191
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,820
essentialist argument however the the constant affirmation you can self ideas

192
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,580
whatever you want that's completely against biological essentialism and what

193
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,620
I've as I've been like digging in and reading and looking through things I've

194
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,420
I've discovered that there is a section of a very radical component of the left

195
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:28,540
where they they never believed in the I was born this way argument they used it

196
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:35,220
as a tactical deployment to subvert liberals yeah and it's like oh it was

197
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,620
really I saw like that literature I was like oh that's very interesting well see

198
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,540
I view it I view this stuff as just Marxism with another coat of paint you

199
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,060
know Marxism is all about deconstruction and deconstructing established things

200
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,340
right so it deconstructs societal norms it deconstructs you know social

201
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,020
relationships and biology is just another front for them to deconstruct

202
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,940
right there is no such thing as gender as sex there you know like except there

203
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,860
is there are biological differences between the sexes there are you know

204
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,460
evolutionary pressures for that and like you said they've gone from a I was born

205
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,380
this way mindset towards human beings are complete blank slates and if that's

206
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,620
the case then you can then you're essentially supporting the get the you

207
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,060
know then you can pray the gateway right that that is a method that works if

208
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,900
we're just blank slates that are the victims of a authoritarian patriarchal

209
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:36,220
system that has subverted everything natural or right about ourselves then we

210
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,140
can just create a brand new system from the top down and reprogram human beings

211
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,220
in any way we want and it but it doesn't work that way and it never has

212
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,540
worked that way I think what they like to rely on is the fact that you can't

213
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,380
really be objective which is true because we're all humans and we all

214
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,780
exist only in one location so none of us can actually be objective but they take

215
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,220
that to mean that there is no objective reality outside of any one human's

216
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,100
perception which is obviously false right right moral relativism is yeah

217
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,220
you know you know if if a hundred people look at the same thing and describe the

218
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,820
same thing there's probably something outside of the hundred people that

219
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,580
exists you know it's not just a hundred delusions that happen to line up so

220
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:24,140
right right right yeah even though we can't really truly access the objective

221
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,060
world and any because our senses are also subjective so we can't access the

222
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:35,220
objective world but it does exist and so basically a lot of the the biology the

223
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,460
philosophy the morality of a lot of these a lot of these people that say on

224
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,420
the blank slate left it completely falls apart because of that reason you

225
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,780
know what really I think as it's funny you bring this up because I think I

226
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,900
think how we got here to the idea that we're now calling women birthing

227
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,300
persons because is because in the leftist side that or at least the

228
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,980
traditional classical liberal mentality is that it's very much like a just you

229
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,820
do you and and you know live and let live in a lot of ways you know and I

230
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,020
think following most liberal-minded people's good nature it and I've heard

231
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,820
this myself I've heard you know talking to people like being post-op and whatnot

232
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,260
and and I'm like yeah I'm post-op trans post-op trans woman and then they'll

233
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,700
like like well I think you're female it's like okay well that's great but I

234
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:39,100
think that has gone to a such a degree where it's like no that person if they

235
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,740
identify as trans actually is that way and so when you do that that's where

236
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,100
they say well men can get pregnant too because the trans woman or trans man has

237
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,300
identified himself as being met a man despite having a womb and producing eggs

238
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,420
that doesn't make it's like yeah it's like the the open-mindedness has

239
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,340
resulted in people like having their brain fall out absolutely instead of

240
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,500
differentiating between a person having some dignity and saying okay fine you

241
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,340
know I will treat you the way that you wish to be treated it's gone to well now

242
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,340
we have to completely rewrite language and biology just to pacify a

243
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,620
statistically insignificant populace it's no fuck that yeah it's it's move

244
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,520
it's moved from treat other people polite to you must view them the way

245
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,040
that I want you to view them like inside exactly in the privacy of your

246
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,200
own head yeah right um so I did a video uh it was our trans woman actually woman

247
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,960
that was the that was yes I watched that I watched what you think of it um I

248
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,120
agree with you oh well thank you I do be honest it's not it's not all entirely my

249
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,960
idea um I got a lot of it from dr. Thomas

250
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,160
pagardas is paper on the subject if you read that or if you know what him I

251
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:03,000
don't know that one no okay um he kind of conception he conceptualized the idea

252
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,640
that because the definition is circular and then of course if you talk to like a

253
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,560
lefty they'll say what who cares the definite circle well it actually matters

254
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,000
that if it's just circle because what that means is that you can't actually

255
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,040
identify what a woman is you can't you can't point to a list of qualities that

256
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,120
woman refers to so if there's no qualities you can't actually have any

257
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,560
woman the woman can't exist which is why this is this is all they don't even

258
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,400
believe that trans women are women they simply use that to backdoor in gender

259
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,160
abolitionism right yeah yeah um but one of the things I pointed out in that

260
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,200
video was that um if we're talking about any other animal aside from humans we

261
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,960
talk about sex we're talking about gamete production we're not talking about

262
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,920
hormones we're not talking about we're not talking about chromosomes we're not

263
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,840
talking about social roles we're talking about gamete production and that's it

264
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,200
and we're also not afraid to point out that you have you know the male of an

265
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,080
animal and the female of an animal and then the neuter of an animal when for

266
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,080
some reason or another they don't produce any gametes mm-hmm and however

267
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,760
once you start talking about humans that that becomes kind of a spicy take when

268
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,960
you say well a trans woman who is post-op isn't male because they don't

269
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,000
produce small gametes and isn't female because they don't produce large gametes

270
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,760
they're neuter because they don't produce any gametes and even though

271
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,440
that's scientifically accurate you will get crucified if you say that right and

272
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,320
moreover too I can't change my chromosomes I also can't change my

273
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:41,600
skeletal structure or my morphic traits in my musculature so you know I always

274
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,960
I've been saying this now for ages but it's like you know I present myself as

275
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,120
female but technically under biology I'm not and that's not to say that you

276
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,640
can't respect me and treat me as female if that's what I choose to do but it

277
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
becomes a level of delusion if you try to suggest that yeah all it takes is

278
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,800
some some hormones and surgery and then we can go bango there you go and

279
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:13,080
moreover it's it doesn't it's this isn't helping anybody I think at the end of it

280
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:20,300
because encouraging this stuff even with trainees such as myself there is

281
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,000
it there's such an extremely high rate of suicide is still in the community so

282
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,440
if I were a moral person I would not want to be promoting this in any way

283
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,080
shape or form because I know that maybe inadvertently you create a social

284
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,240
disease maybe inadvertently you create gender dysphoria and when you create

285
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,520
gender dysphoria you are creating something that has a almost a fifty

286
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,400
percent suicide rate well if there is nothing moral or ethical about that if

287
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,080
you happen to believe that more trans people existing is good and less trans

288
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,880
people existing is a trans genocide then you actually might think that creating

289
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,160
more trans people is good and spreading gender dysphoria if it could be spread

290
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,840
is good what you're doing is you're creating more suicides though I mean

291
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,320
they don't care about that at the end of the day right that's the black pill

292
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,480
is that there's a part of the left that just doesn't give a shit about that well

293
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,440
yeah if I if I were a a conspirator really minded person I would suggest

294
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,520
that this is just yet another front towards the leftist mentality that

295
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,160
humans are a cancer on the world and they're they're trying to engineer so

296
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,800
that the birth rates further collapse you know if I were to to go down that

297
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,240
rabbit hole I think this is just yet another thing to try to get people to

298
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,080
not have children and reduce pop global population I don't know about that one

299
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,120
that that one sounds a bit far-fetched to me I honestly I think I think that's

300
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,800
happening you know fast enough without throwing this into the mix exactly I

301
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
mean you look at the gym you look at the demographics and in you know in 50 years

302
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,040
yeah the population is naturally going to fall off a cliff there's no need to

303
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,800
tinker with the birth rates or any of that when that's gonna happen naturally

304
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:15,760
so but it does seem a sense of nihilism or insanity behind it and there's this

305
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,000
is not motivated I think the trans ideology is not motivated by compassion

306
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,640
or empathy or kindness it's in it's motivated by entitlements self

307
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,680
righteousness money and greed this there's there's nothing compassionate

308
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,280
about it like I think if you were truly wanting to help somebody you would be

309
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,480
honest with them and you would have transparency and there's nothing like

310
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:50,200
that in this in this movement transparency not that that show that was

311
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:58,000
out there for a while transparent it was the guy from curb your enthusiasm I

312
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,680
think or no is the the the the dad character from what's that arrested

313
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:15,480
development he played a brands gendered parent and there was a drama show about

314
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,680
that man I so I've been recently watching house I haven't seen house

315
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,960
before okay sure and that was I think it started in what like 2004 2008 or yeah

316
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:33,000
yeah that was that was yeah before the 2008 collapse yeah yeah and there's a

317
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,920
few trans characters and a few like jokes at the expense of trans people in

318
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,720
that show man you couldn't say that shit on TV today or show what they showed on

319
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,720
TV it was it was funny as fuck but I'm like wow this I'm surprised it's on

320
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,960
it's still on like streaming services in 2023 you know what I mean like Jesus

321
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,600
it's it's so nefarious that you bring that up because I was listening to a

322
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,080
youtuber talk about how I think Jennifer Aniston was saying that you couldn't

323
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,360
make friends as a show anymore because of the cut kind of like 90s humor that

324
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,280
that exists you know like that that's not allowed anymore you're not allowed

325
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,560
like Joey the the guy on that show or he'd be he'd be homophobic and there'd

326
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,160
be you know a mass outrage and it was interesting because the people now that

327
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,520
are writing TV and cinema are because you know like Millennials or or Gen Xers

328
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,800
that grew up with that stuff and were you know laughing at it and having a

329
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,800
grand old time with it but now they're the ones that are saying oh well that's

330
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:43,840
not allowed so I don't yeah yeah it bothers me that we have very much of the

331
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,480
mindset of oh we have to judge the past on our current sensibilities and more

332
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,920
often than not that leads to you know iconoclastic ideas where it's like oh

333
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,960
well we have to tear down these statues because they're offensive to our

334
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,200
sensibilities now it doesn't matter they've been sitting there for for 150

335
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,360
years or they're a part of the history you know we've we've deigned them impure

336
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,000
they therefore they have to be destroyed just like this is yeah yeah iconoclasts

337
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,960
never are received well in history I've been so this is my good reason what to

338
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:23,880
because I recall hearing stories of my dad when he was in his teens and 20s

339
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,200
getting into hockey brawls he was a amateur hockey player yeah okay very

340
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,520
Canadian you know yeah yeah yeah oh very cool I'm gonna drink some molesons after

341
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:39,080
cool yeah but by the time I came along he wasn't that guy anymore he had kind

342
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:46,080
of settled down right yeah and I recall being like 10 or 11 and I'm at the

343
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,160
knock you know I was younger than that I would have been like 7 or 8 and we were

344
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,480
at the theme park and my dad really wanted me to go on these crazy

345
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,520
rollercoasters with him and I was too young to go and I was like I can't

346
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,840
handle this I'm way too young but then once I'm 16 and 17 we're back at the

347
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,800
same theme park and then my dad won't do it now he's too old nice old right

348
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,920
yeah and he's like well like my tastes have just changed it's like okay wait

349
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,600
and then now I'm thinking like well firstly my tastes now that I'm in my

350
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,080
30s my tastes haven't changed when I was in my teens or 20s I mean they changed a

351
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,480
little bit but like not much I can still like go back and watch jackass or

352
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,920
something or MX yeah you know those old with the edgy shows or um but I realized

353
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,480
that I think what's happened is basically a lot of people my age a lot

354
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,520
of the Millennials they had their fill of edgy content when they were younger

355
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,880
and now that they've grown up and maybe now they're they're a bit older maybe

356
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,360
they have houses or they have partners they have kids or they're they're in

357
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,960
they're in the workforce they're you know out of school by at least a decade

358
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,440
or more now they're like oh well now I'm getting older and I'm becoming more

359
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,640
responsible but I'm still a millennial because the millennial it's a phrase it

360
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,280
has like a certain weight to it you know yeah yeah well I've noticed that like a

361
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,440
lot of people and I'm also guilty of this to it some extent what do my age we

362
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,640
still act like we're the youngest generation but we're not anymore yeah I

363
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,840
don't know if it's with you but it's kind of psychological with me where it

364
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,360
feels like I'm still 25 and I'm not yeah yeah and I think a lot of the reason why

365
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,400
Millennials are they're basically discarding all the humor that they grew

366
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,840
up with in the 90s and the 2000s is because their tastes have changed as a

367
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,640
natural result of growing up and they think that all that all of society

368
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,400
should change with that because they're still the the youngest they're still the

369
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,360
center of society see I think I think it's something different I think it's

370
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,000
sort of a I see you'd mentioned certain milestones that they've gotten you know

371
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,040
they've had relationships or that they have of houses and families and jobs and

372
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,440
whatnot well Millennials are kind of the lost generation in that way

373
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,560
Millennials have a lower participation in the job labor force than Jen Z or

374
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,840
Gen Z does when it comes to a percentage of wealth owned Millennials have the

375
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,900
like the lowest by comparison to boomers and Xers which makes sense but even Gen

376
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,660
Zers have a little bit more wealth to it because fewer of them are going to

377
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,740
college and getting debt-trapped so what I think you have is kind of a quasi

378
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,500
state of arrested development for some and in others it's I don't actually own

379
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,300
anything the kind of work that I'm doing is you know unfulfilling and low paying

380
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:45,460
and I think maybe there's a sense of a strive for something greater as you get

381
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,420
older certainly you fill that hole with family and relationships and obligations

382
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,980
but if you can't actually achieve those milestones I think maybe it's filled

383
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:01,940
with with politics or this quasi sense of morality I kind of get that feeling

384
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:11,700
so well speaking of Millennials writing things yes what an excellent transition

385
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,860
or segue again there's that word again so last time we talked yeah you had

386
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,220
decided you you you opened up some sort of fundraiser was it I forget which one

387
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,740
it was was a go-fund-me or was a Kickstarter it was an Indiegogo actually

388
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,460
right okay sorry sorry yes yes yes you started up an Indiegogo for the first

389
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:39,340
issue of Linkara's your expert from a long time ago Lightbringer comic and it

390
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,420
was issue one yeah and the from what I remember the Indiegogo was going well

391
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,540
and I don't hit your goal right it's been funded so if yeah the and and I'll

392
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,820
certainly provide you the link to the but you but yeah we funded it the the

393
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,420
first comic is out there no way you haven't sent him a copy because I

394
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:04,700
suspect you'll just throw it away but yeah we were successful in it so yeah I

395
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:11,220
I do recall trying to find out what he thought of this well I was telling what

396
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,220
we thought about it and in fact that's kind of one of the motivators that we

397
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,900
have from one of the add-ons on this campaign well so okay so following the

398
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,900
change the channel drama that took place right there was a youtuber by the name

399
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,180
of V infuso and V infuso made a bunch of really good videos that that kind of

400
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,280
chronicled the events as they were unfolding and he spoke directly with

401
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:39,500
Mars girl obscures Luppa Ollie Brown the HR lady like he was kind of seen very

402
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,180
very well amongst that group so when it came time to kind of announce this this

403
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,380
thing I reached out to him and asked hey would you be willing to go like have a

404
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,340
stream or something that I can talk about it and just sort of catch up from

405
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,940
where we were at is from change the channel he's like oh I'd love to so we

406
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,820
have this stream and from what I understand somebody tweeted Linkara

407
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:06,660
about it Linkara then flagged it really and yeah he flagged it and I don't know

408
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,860
if he got a strike or not but he flagged it and then on Twitter he called

409
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,540
me a piece of shit so yeah I have the receipts I can dig him up for you but

410
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:24,740
sure it amounted to he apparently lost a lot of respect for me after I voted for

411
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,060
Trump and he went on this you know mean-spirited rant so seven years ago at

412
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:37,540
this point Jesus yeah yeah so we we we decided to kind of roll into that spin a

413
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:44,540
little bit so now we have make light bringer great again hats so we call

414
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,540
amalgam hats so one of the tiers we have is at the top there you know I just like

415
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,740
to so people have asked me so are you gonna send him one it's like again he's

416
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,260
probably gonna throw it away I know there's probably people out there who

417
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,700
would ask to have it signed at a con and would film themselves doing that I

418
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,860
certainly can't you know endorse you doing that or you know I'm not

419
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:12,180
encouraging you to troll by any stretch but I would like to see the the video if

420
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:16,700
it were to come out I'm just saying that does the car even go to cons anymore I

421
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:22,460
mean it's not that I don't know I'm easy well I don't try to follow him for what

422
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,340
he does a lot of the time anything any developments I get about his life are

423
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,060
kind of forwarded to me by third parties because again I can't ever really get

424
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,540
off the internet and I think or get free of the old stuff that I did I think

425
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,220
having realized that it's gotten a lot more expensive with the economy slowing

426
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,120
down and the costs have gone up as compared to last year I'm really

427
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,580
considering getting backing into streaming and or at least doing

428
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,260
something so that I can reestablish myself again so I don't have to you know

429
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,300
hop around on to other people's channels and just sort of get back into it myself

430
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,700
but yeah I know that he did some streaming and he people asked him about

431
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,700
oni plays and he got really upset about it you know they're always making fun of

432
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:12,220
me and you know he's just not Doug Doug Walker had a redemption arc and I didn't

433
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,660
think that was possible after the change the channel stuff so I got a respect for

434
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,820
it no mad respect for them for Doug he's he's he's managed to clause place back

435
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,940
on the internet and considering how he didn't die after the wall video it's

436
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:32,820
like the man's not human right like so good good for him so yeah but but

437
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,860
leycarra it just seems like I don't see it getting any better and yeah I wish

438
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,380
him the best I really do I'm not trying to hold grudges but he's he's turned

439
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,980
into this person that that is one of those types we were talking about so

440
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,880
yeah you know I mean it's it's so strange to think that like you know a

441
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,000
decade ago or I guess even more than a decade at this point yeah I really

442
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,320
looked up to channel awesome like I was a I you know the I told you the story

443
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,600
last time you were here but I'll recap it real quick just for the sake of this

444
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:12,680
video um 2009 I I really liked a VGN and I really really like spoonie and I

445
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,720
wanted to be on channel awesome so so me and my friends were you know running

446
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,080
around the suburbs with that with a with a camera shooting some really dumb

447
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:25,960
videos didn't really go anywhere yeah and then like I after the the angry

448
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,840
reviewer thing died off I did some let's plays and those kind of gained some

449
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,720
traction and I did some gamergate stuff and that gained a lot of traction and I

450
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,160
made friends with Sargon and I started doing politics and like yeah so I kind

451
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,560
of made my own way and and now like I'm I'm surprisingly bigger than spoonie

452
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,720
when spoonie was the guy that made me not not made me that sweet was the guy

453
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,760
that inspired you yeah yeah it's funny because like you can go back and watch

454
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,240
John Tron's from John Tron's first video and he's like spoonie inspired me

455
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,960
it's like damn yeah yeah and and now all these people are like they're kind of

456
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,800
it's it's it's it's really mean to say but they're kind of like washed up you

457
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
know or yeah yeah they've not really gained anything and I think that's one

458
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,440
of the biggest tragedies for the change the channel movement is that you saw the

459
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,840
main players of it and I didn't I guess I didn't realize this at the time but I

460
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,400
came at it as from an angle of yeah they did wrong but now that they've you know

461
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,040
like here's here's the various reasons why but maybe this is gonna be a good

462
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,040
lesson for all of us to kind of hold ourselves to a higher standard you know

463
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,840
now that we have the warning signs of abusers in our midst which is kind of

464
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,640
what the whole G Wario thing was as well as the management was maybe we're not

465
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,080
gonna tolerate this stuff anymore maybe we're gonna use this as an inspiration

466
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,120
for our own works and really strive to become something better but in reality I

467
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,760
think it was just another casualty or at least like a me too equivalency

468
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,440
because now now that it's been so far out there's another youtuber called that

469
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,120
the almighty lolly who did a good kind of breakdown of the document and said

470
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,520
well this isn't support there's no evidence for this claim there's no

471
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,300
evidence for this claim this is hearsay there's that this is one person's opinion

472
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,040
this is one person's like for me I had the receipts like everybody saw me get

473
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,340
my knee kicked in you know we when we posted the the the waiver they had a

474
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,740
sign for oh well we're not you if you get injured on site you know you you

475
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,660
know it's not our fault and we're not gonna help you because we have no

476
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,340
insurance and and you know yeah it's very easy to prove that they didn't have

477
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:31,300
filming permits for this stuff but that's all that you could like but yeah

478
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,900
so the fact that you were there you saw things and spoke to people and you can't

479
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,420
really reproduce that as evidence you know right and that's what I've said to

480
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,020
where it's like I'm putting my integrity on the line because I literally had I

481
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:49,180
can't prove that I picked up Juario's phone and you know trying to figure out

482
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,620
whose phone it belonged to it's it had a listing for my wife and my slave in it I

483
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,340
can't prove that so I'm going to come out of the woodwork and say well here's

484
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,060
what I've experienced I have nothing to gain from this and only to stand to lose

485
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:07,180
on this so if you don't believe me that's fine I get it but that was

486
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,900
actually that I had to do it in in my in the video I recorded today where

487
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,300
basically I had to point out that um if you if you go anywhere on the internet

488
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,340
it's just it's a slight side story it's okay if you go anywhere and you look up

489
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,260
the the phrase cultural Marxism okay you find that it's it's considered you know

490
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,060
an alt-right anti-semitic conspiracy theory and it's it's nazism in there

491
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:36,580
however you know I was in introductory to critical theory first year university

492
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,060
course in 2007 where the professor said that this was cultural Marxism and I had

493
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,580
a positive connotation and that is you will not find that on the Wikipedia

494
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,180
article not anymore you you could find that you know ten years ago in the

495
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,180
computer article not anymore not not not since Jordan Pearson started talking

496
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,220
about it on his on his YouTube channel you know in like 2016 or whatever it was

497
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,740
so you it's one thing that I've that I've been completely unprepared for as

498
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:09,860
I've gotten older is hat the way that like younger people or even just

499
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,380
uninformed people or misinformed people will come to me and describe to me

500
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:22,060
historical events that I was present for right with such like insane inaccuracy

501
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,060
like they're just they're so wrong and they're so sure of themselves and I'm

502
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:32,740
like I was there that's not how that was you know exactly exactly it's yeah yeah

503
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,220
you're right it there's sort of a weird reprogramming of events or just history

504
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,700
itself which is why it's so horrifying that even when it's as simple as

505
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,260
something with like a rolled doll book or dr. Seuss you know they they go back

506
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,180
and they try to change it that is so yeah that's yeah disgusting that's right

507
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:57,180
out of 1984 now I completely agree um when it comes to the the channel awesome

508
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,940
stuff I mean you know Doug still doing well Lindsay Ellis still seems to be

509
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,420
doing well angry Joe's doing okay really see I thought she quit the internet I

510
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,620
thought yeah she she got a contract with nebula and so she does content on nebula

511
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:14,020
now but for her yeah I'm glad to hear that yeah because I know the last time I

512
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,020
looked in her she she kind of she made an oopsie in her fans can't cancel there

513
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,940
so yeah well she kind of cultivated that like lefty can wall and base no kidding

514
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,660
you live by social justice you died by social justice so you know but she kind

515
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,020
of she left YouTube but she got a contract with nebula so she makes videos

516
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,540
on nebula now I've never heard of that thing so I don't know that nebula is

517
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,620
it's like a Netflix service where you pay monthly to get access to the videos

518
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,940
but it's for you total okay legal legal makes videos there Lindsay Ellis makes

519
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,260
videos there okay cool there's a bunch of creators that use it but I don't know

520
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,900
any more outside from those two but it is like a pretty decent stable of people

521
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:59,380
over there okay yeah I'll have to check it out I was yeah if it's well okay good

522
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,220
yeah every Joe is still relevant to and it's in some ways too but you know I

523
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:08,460
know like um Brad Jones he's he's kind of like yes grown but he hasn't really

524
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,300
shrunk he's just kind of been doing his own thing in his own sphere but like

525
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:18,660
aside from those four I think everyone has just collapsed like Linkara has a

526
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,700
subs and spoon he still has a subs and like the VGA guys they still have their

527
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,020
subs but no one watches their stuff anymore you know right their viewership

528
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:33,980
has gone down and I know that you know one of Linkara's and again there's a

529
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,540
youtuber by the name of Kinky Linky I know who Kinky Linky is yep yep yep and

530
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,340
he kind of chronicles some of the stuff but like there was a message that or a

531
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,660
tweet that that Linkara put out where it's like oh my history of the Power

532
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,500
Rangers made like $500 and oh yeah I'm totally not making it and I'm totally

533
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:58,380
poor ha ha ha ha I'm doing it but like the fact that yeah the Patreon amount is

534
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,700
really not gotten to like it's certainly not keeping up with inflation the

535
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,500
viewership has gone down I know we had to go to a dental college to get his

536
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,060
wisdom teeth out and you don't do that if you have dental coverage and right

537
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,380
you're like you don't show you what is dental college so the dental college is

538
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,060
okay so you go to a dentist to get your wisdom teeth out right you need an

539
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:24,340
orthodontist yet that right well dental college is just like that where if

540
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:30,180
you're an aspiring dentist or oral hygienist or or any of that stuff you

541
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,500
go there and you act as sort of like a practice guinea pig for the the learning

542
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,660
students and it's at a reduced cost of course because they're less professional

543
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:44,780
okay and yeah all right yeah yeah it's the sort of thing you do where if you

544
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:50,380
don't have dental coverage do stuff like that or if you can't afford the

545
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,580
painkillers afterward you you just take a bunch extra strength Tylenol right

546
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,260
like you can't afford the the Percocet or whatever it is they give you and the

547
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,620
big one for like I know this is a little bit old but like there was a point in

548
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,920
time where he shilled his fans for $7,000 to pay his taxes like a like a

549
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,220
few days before they were due it's like you're not in a good place if you're

550
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,500
doing stuff like that and I'm not saying that to be petty or spiteful

551
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,860
spiteful or vindictive despite everything Linkara does have a great

552
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:25,500
work ethic you know he does his videos on a very clockwork basis but at this

553
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,820
stage every and you probably know this as well too the youtubers really only

554
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,780
have three to five years of their golden years and then they just sort of are on

555
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,620
decline or they're struggling for relevance I think he should have gotten

556
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,980
off the wagon a while ago and just tried to find either work in the

557
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,100
industry or recommitted himself to more of a day job because at least in a day

558
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,940
job you have paid time off you have health and medical insurance benefits

559
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,900
you have a 401k stuff and you know your your rates are at least competitive to

560
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,700
the market so you're you'll compare pay rates five years ago where they are now

561
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,620
and they are higher because of inflation and because of other economic pressures

562
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,060
you really only get a pay rate if you can get more subscribers more viewers

563
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:15,860
or more patrons yeah and now easy to do I think that that's kind of true a lot

564
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,420
of youtubers do fall into that trap where they they go through a boom and

565
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,180
then they're now they have a bunch of subs but no one's really tuning in

566
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,260
anymore they're all dead subs and they're wondering like hey I have like a

567
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,100
500,000 sub channel how come I get you know five viewers a stream or how come I

568
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:35,060
get like a thousand viewers a video however I do think at this point

569
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,580
youtubing as a career has been developed enough that I think we know how to get

570
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,140
out of that trap okay what are your thoughts on it I'm genuinely curious

571
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,940
well you can you can see like you see guys like destiny for example or he like

572
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,340
reinvented himself every few years and that's kind of what kept him going you

573
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,980
know you look at yeah Sargon or red letter media they both decided to turn

574
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,820
like corporate where they started a company they got like a warehouse or

575
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,780
an office and they are they they actually reinvested it didn't just coast

576
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,780
that's how you get out of the trap is if you take you know oh you know a big

577
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,580
payday maybe you get like $5,000 or $10,000 in one month though it's a big

578
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:17,140
payday you know you don't party it up or you don't like cozy you have you take

579
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,340
that money and maybe you hire somebody maybe you try to expand your business

580
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:26,180
like there's there's get an editor yeah yeah yeah there's like I'm looking at

581
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,100
this this new crop of streamers who are coming up you know and they're all doing

582
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,380
that now like Chedlogic hired an editor yeah right you got like 500 viewers a

583
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,660
stream but he hired an editor and it's you know it's working out for him um

584
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,900
there's oh man who else who else could I name drop here real quick well yeah no I

585
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,300
agree with you that's that's what separates I think red letter media from

586
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,460
from channel awesome is that they did that they they don't what made red

587
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,140
letter media famous was the most little merciful planker revealer from our

588
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,780
he hasn't done a mr. Plinkett review in years and he's last year he did like the

589
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,420
how little Halloween mini skit but that's about it yeah you're right so so

590
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,420
he's that character is pretty much dead by all intents and purposes but he did

591
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:13,660
use that theme to create half in the bag to create several movies that they that

592
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:19,040
they released exactly all this other stuff that they do now a wheel of the

593
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,420
worst now they they've managed to grow it from you know certainly they invested

594
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,260
in their equipment the studios and they they have upped their game but if you

595
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,660
look at the quality of videos that when car is doing it's exactly the same thing

596
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:37,300
now as it was ten years ago so that's probably I think at some point you have

597
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,540
to stop doing the fight with yourself skits in your living uh-huh right or if

598
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,100
you're if your movie is gonna be you saving the world because what you do is

599
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,740
so important you know I I would love to see maybe not given the original comic

600
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,740
books creation but like if Linkara really did want to break into comics or

601
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,900
get into the industry he should have tried to develop his own comics years

602
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,860
ago and he or he should be doing what I'm doing and you know take either

603
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,220
light bringer or revolution of the mask or some of these other ones that he's

604
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:15,000
he's done and try to redo them to a more professional degree and see what he can

605
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,900
create he has the audience for it he has the you know he could raise it like I

606
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,420
don't have any doubt that he could hit the targets that I'm aiming for and he'd

607
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,980
probably actually be able to make some money off him too so it's a shame to see

608
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,900
him give up on his own IPs it's a shame to see him you know be this reviewer but

609
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,620
at the same time I do think it's something too smart to be said about

610
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,460
well if you can't create criticize and maybe that's the case if you're right

611
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,820
but that's not to say you can't improve everybody's gonna slam on light bringer

612
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:54,340
the original one or his his original fantasy novels but but remember that the

613
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:59,980
original light bringer was made in like what 2007 it's like 15 years ago you as

614
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:08,300
a writer could have grown by that point how old is he back in 2007 he's probably

615
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:14,700
gosh he's a few years younger than me so 15 years so probably young 20s or late

616
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,940
teens yeah I know that this point I'm a completely different person from where I

617
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,900
was back then literally and physically and physiologically as well too I might

618
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:29,140
add so the fact that you can you know if you have some of the the intellectual

619
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:35,820
humility to try to redo that yeah he was able to successfully raise $60,000 for a

620
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:40,700
movie why not try to create a comic again if you don't know how to do it

621
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:45,180
then then do the due diligence do the research treat it like a craft but

622
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:49,180
you're like you say you're never gonna stagnate and just do the same shtick

623
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,300
anymore it's like yeah I did you hit lightning in a bottle in 2010 but it

624
00:49:53,300 --> 00:50:00,740
ain't 2010 anymore so yeah yeah oh man so actually there was a period of time

625
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:06,740
where I'd been confusing Linkara with what was his name

626
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:11,740
Kyle Callahan Oh Kyle Callahan yeah yes was that the

627
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:17,420
brows held high guy I think so I think so yes I think yeah this is gonna sound

628
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,620
kind of me but there's no real there's no real nice way to say it Linkara's

629
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,380
current girlfriend is that overweight black woman right that's his wife

630
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,380
actually wife now okay yes okay so Kyle has a very similar like looking you know

631
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,860
in shape kind of girlfriend okay and there was yes physique yes there was

632
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,380
actually a controversy I don't know if you remember this with Kyle where and I

633
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,020
thought it was Linkara till I had to like I'd like double-check but it was it

634
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:52,620
was Kyle um where basically he tweeted out that he hated his life he was

635
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:58,540
depressed about his relationship and his girlfriend has been forcing him to like

636
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:04,620
parrot her very progressive politics on his Twitter and on his channel when he

637
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:09,500
had a channel and that basic because like he had an obligation to make the

638
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,700
world a little bit better with with the platform that he had and that this was

639
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,900
this was one of the main reasons why he basically self-destructed and destroyed

640
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,860
his platform and he hated her for it and these tweets you know she put them out

641
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,620
they didn't really go viral because he doesn't have that reach anymore no one

642
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,100
cares about channel awesome anymore but people noticed and then they were they

643
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,340
were like quickly deleted you know mm-hmm and yet no over time that story

644
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:39,940
kind of morphed into Linkara but it was actually Kyle well two things first with

645
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:44,100
Kyle is that the the limited information or interaction I had with him he always

646
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,340
seemed like a very unhappy person I don't I really do have a lot of empathy

647
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,000
for him because having suffered from depression and I'm sure you've been in

648
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,140
your low points as well too you know it sounded as though he had some really bad

649
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,020
situations with some of the people he dated I think you know I don't want to

650
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,420
air any dirty laundry or anything but yeah he seemed like somebody that really

651
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,260
needed to kind of take a step back and re-examine where he was going so it's

652
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,580
not surprising to me that he tweeted that because yeah he was also very much

653
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,860
inundated with social justice when when it was still kind of getting started or

654
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:21,340
at least when I was noticing it which I guess are two separate things yeah the

655
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,660
other thing though with with so Linkara's wife that deep lore goes down

656
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:33,740
so okay the when I broke up with with Linkara we kind of or you know we ended

657
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:39,820
our relationship and I did that she was actually a superfan of his she managed

658
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:46,540
one of the tumblr accounts for it is this like that like an April von Lon

659
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:51,300
situation where like you don't don't hate the fans do not date yeah it kind

660
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:56,100
of is where but she she actually married him he married her I don't know I don't

661
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,980
know the specifics but she went to started going to he she figured out all

662
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,100
the conventions he was going to and started to kind of go to the same ones

663
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,660
that he went so she could kind of insert herself into this and that sounds yeah

664
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:15,340
yeah I had a mutual friend of mine that worked on a she worked as a person on

665
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:21,020
Linkara's production for his movie she also managed I think his Twitter she

666
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,060
she was connected with him and she did some work for him she was paid for it

667
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,820
too so but she was starting to warn him about her because she had something of a

668
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,980
double you know a public face and a private face and she was you know very

669
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:38,660
aggressive towards this this lady who was female and all that and she was

670
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,420
trying to warn him about it but he wouldn't really listen to it and I

671
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,860
remember meeting her for the first time she did like a size you up sort of look

672
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:50,060
and I thought that was really weird and I'm like and then she got really kind of

673
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:55,540
like PDA on Linkara and I'm like honey you don't need to worry about that I'm

674
00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:00,260
not here to steal your man I'm not I'm just you know how many how many years

675
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:06,940
after you'd broken up was this oh gosh probably four or five it was a while I

676
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,580
mean it was beyond it was after my surgery it was it was beyond that point

677
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:17,700
and you know I thought that was really strange and again I don't want to go

678
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:23,860
into specifics just made like I should given how nasty he's been to me I feel

679
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,060
as though I probably should drag him through the mud a little bit but I still

680
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:32,540
think it's not classy to talk about some some stuff but regardless of the fact he

681
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:37,300
ended up marrying her they live together they do their thing I don't think they

682
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:42,580
get along well with or her parents approve of that situation I know his

683
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:49,860
when cars own mother is is she's very pro-trump and I think they don't speak

684
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:56,500
or on or are on good terms and some of the kinky-linky videos or people that

685
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,780
are kind of associated with that like there used to be a point and I've kind

686
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,300
of noticed this too like there used to be a point in time when we were dating

687
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,580
that he was very much like that he didn't want to be like oh I'm the

688
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,380
Christian kid or anything but he didn't swear willy-nilly he didn't he was

689
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,940
trying to keep it clean right he didn't go on the swearing tangents or whatnot

690
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:19,180
but that has absolutely changed I think since he got with Vega where he just

691
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:25,300
goes on these filthy sailor just f you and nasty mean-spirited rants about

692
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:30,460
people so that that didn't seem like his character back then so I don't know I

693
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:36,300
I'm not trying to psychoanalyze anybody but one of the reasons I ultimately

694
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,140
decided channel awesome wasn't for me was because people were living in these

695
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,980
egocentric bubbles right you get the feeling like if everybody's telling you

696
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,700
you're great and awesome and amazing you start to think your shit don't stink and

697
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,700
it absolutely does and you should have people that are calling you out for your

698
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,940
nonsense but if you label anybody that calls you out for your nonsense as being

699
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:00,060
a troll a hater or whatever you're you're you're giving your self an

700
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,140
excuse not to ever have any self-reflection or improve and I think

701
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,660
given his circumstances with his his wife I I get the feeling that there's

702
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:14,180
probably a lot more of that even worse going on so you know objectivity goes

703
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:19,740
out the window in that case so but it's a grass like I said the floor goes even

704
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:26,340
worse well actually I have one question and I'll cut I'll cut this part out if

705
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:32,900
you don't want it publicly so yeah but this is okay but still I'll cut it out

706
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:39,020
if you want it if you want to cut it okay no problem what considering that

707
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:43,300
Linkara's mother was you know very very Christian it sounds like and like you

708
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:49,720
know voted Trump and all that how did she react to you we don't know or I don't

709
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,760
know because here's what I'll say about Linkara's parents is they never ever

710
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,080
treated me any less than being very kind and equitable and friendly and supportive

711
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:06,680
and I'm I'm sure that conversation happened at some point and I don't know

712
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:13,440
when it happened but Avanel was nothing but kind to me and in fact the there was

713
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,480
there was a point in time when we were still kind of starting to date right or

714
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,880
just early in the relationship and his brother got bought a house he and his

715
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,120
wife bought a house and there was you know there's some old they needed some

716
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,040
help with some renovations there's this old disgusting wallpaper and I remember

717
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,640
having like this this like humidifier gun thing that you just sort of ran

718
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,560
against the wall that had a bunch of steam so it would loosen all the glue

719
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,360
and you'd peel it off really kind of gross and disgusting work right so I go

720
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,560
over there and I'm like okay well Linkara is you know doing a little bit

721
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,180
I'm like I'm not just gonna stand around and I'm gonna help you know so I

722
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:51,740
I go inside of this bedroom and got the the the thing to peel the wallpaper off

723
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:57,100
the wall and I remember talking to Avanel and she was very very friendly and

724
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:01,900
sweet to me she was very we talked about you know how I had an investment at the

725
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,980
time that was doing okay despite it being 2009 or whatever it was with the

726
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:13,580
economy crashed and you know she seemed very supportive now I don't know I don't

727
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,820
want to stick myself in because it's like we we've been not dating for so

728
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,260
such a long time but I get the distinct feeling that she does not approve of

729
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:26,540
Vega and that ironically she met with she would probably approve of me or did

730
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:31,700
approve of me back then I don't know but yeah definitively his parents were very

731
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,540
kind to me and I never had any reason like even back then before all this

732
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:40,620
stuff was mainstream that they didn't treat me like a decent person so okay

733
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:45,580
funny how that works that was just more for my own curiosity then well see I

734
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,540
would love to like reach out to her and be like hey you know if you want a

735
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,740
Malga hat or your here's your son's IP she might get a kick out of it and you

736
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:58,420
know I I get the distinct feeling even to this day we the two of us would be

737
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,420
able to sit down and have a great conversation and have a good laugh and

738
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:08,100
you know there'd be no problems there I don't I don't think at all so hmm yeah

739
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:12,300
great question though that's the first time anybody's asked me that do you want

740
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:17,180
me to leave that in okay okay okay that's kind of well it's kind of a

741
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,380
personal question it's up to you I don't care that much yeah well I mean you see

742
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,700
I've gotten more questions where it's like oh so how many times and Linkara go

743
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:33,180
down on you it's like I'm not it's saying any of that no but yeah it does

744
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:38,740
make me wonder about what that dynamic looks like but who knows yeah I'm sure

745
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:46,260
I'm sure as hell not gonna reach out so so yeah you are doing because late

746
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:51,380
bringer one was successful you're now doing light bringer two that's right so

747
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,900
so I'm not sure when this will get out but we are kind of on the last legs of

748
00:59:54,900 --> 01:00:00,740
the campaign where we've we're about 70 as of this call where it's six or 78

749
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:05,860
percent there so last period last time we had around five thousand or so that

750
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,620
we were asking and if that's what we were asking for we would hit it but

751

754
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:28,420
miss the first one we do have a digital catch-up for it we do have a limited run

01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,780
of the first book and you can get the second book it with it or if you really

756
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:37,300
want to help us out you can back it with some some artwork or the the searing

757
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,500
light of justice tear which will have everything that we're offering in the

758
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:47,020
campaign with it so yeah no it's it's the campaign ends on the 12th right yeah

759
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:51,580
or it's six days from now so it's on the 11th on the 11th okay yeah yep since

760
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:57,300
next Tuesday from here right yeah this is coming out on Friday so okay yeah so

761
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,980
you have the weekend basically in like the Monday to to get in on this if you

762
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,660
want to so we'll see what happens I mean typically near the end of it we'll get

763
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,360
you know some last-minute people we might have a few more streams we can go

764
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:14,180
on to you know I think if we do get out where it's gonna be down to the wire so

765
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,900
so here's hoping knock on wood that we can because we've we've really upped the

766
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,020
game with this one we the art has gone up a significant notch we have a

767
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,460
different artist this time because the original artist had his own campaign

768
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,660
that he did and he got too busy so we had to pick up Dean James and Dean isn't

769
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,220
he's incredible so you know you can see some of the example pages that we've got

770
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:42,740
and yeah yeah so how we can absolutely get this going I'd love to see it be

771
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:49,380
realized so how how does it actually work like if you don't hit your 6700 do

772
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,540
you lose all the money or like what's the actual yeah it more or less gets

773
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:57,580
refunded back so they have they have two options right so they have it where

774
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,580
and this is where your reputation has to be sterling with it where you have two

775
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,060
options where if you don't hit your goal everything gets refunded in the washes

776
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:09,260
you have the second option where even if you don't get your goal you kind of keep

777
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:13,620
what you were able to raise the downside though is that that option has been sort

778
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:18,380
of abused by enough people where people are kind of sketchy if you are wary to

779
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,520
back that just because a lot of people or at least enough in the past took the

780
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,840
money and ran and never produced anything right so you know the last

781
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,120
thing I want to ever do is take people's money and then not produce anything

782
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,840
about anything I put my name on I want to have to be the highest level that I

783
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,640
can manage with it so I'm not sure we'll have to talk I'll have to talk with

784
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:43,800
Anthony my producer about it where maybe we can try to see if we can figure it

785
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:49,160
out a way to still do it or have it go to fulfillment or or what needs to be

786
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,160
done to we're very close we're less than 1,500 there so it's still within the

787
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,920
realm of possibility that we can get it through so all right well but yeah I

788
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,600
appreciate you taking the time and allowing me to shill my shit on your

789
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:09,200
street videos of course of course I mean I've listen I've as you know when I was

790
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,920
that when I was a youngster I really enjoyed the the channel awesome ecosystem

791
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,600
yeah and and now that I'm like it's it's never gonna be not strange that I'm

792
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,480
bigger than some of my heroes when I was younger you know it's always gonna be a

793
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:29,280
weird feeling so yeah and you never know I maybe one day I can get back up on

794
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,440
that horse I do have other projects I'm working on you know part of the part of

795
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:41,480
the the homework I put for myself was to up my writing style or my skill in it so

796
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:49,080
I started I've been working on some TV TV pilot episodes I've a friend of mine

797
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,360
and I are working on a movie script too so you know I'm not saying it'll amount

798
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:58,800
to anything but I am trying to still chase that skill set so that what if and

799
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,600
when opportunity strikes I'll be ready so yeah and you know you could always

800
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,320
just play you could always just play your identity go to Hollywood you're

801
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:13,760
trans you'll get right in there I mean yeah it's it's about who you know so

802
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,420
yeah yeah it is nice to be to refer to myself though is like an established

803
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,440
writer though I were you we were an author I got like bringer one out there

804
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:29,960
and I see this thing as a as a 24 issue arc or season like this whole thing that

805
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,240
I have in my mind definitely this first story is gonna be a three-parter so we I

806
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,400
come hell or high water even if we can't get it done and it turns into a

807
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,480
vanity project I still want to do it because the last one of my personal

808
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,800
failings in the channel awesome day was that I would start things and not finish

809
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:51,080
them so even if it cost me money even if I don't make any money off of it I still

810
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,920
believe enough in light bringer just to want to see it shine so yeah yeah I know

811
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,680
exactly you know I mm-hmm I've man when I was you know in high school I was like

812
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,040
programming video games always wanted to make my own games ended up you know

813
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,080
that got swept away just by life because like I went through so many just other

814
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,640
phases of what I was doing but man if I could get to like a million subs on

815
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,800
YouTube who knows if I don't happen but if it did I would definitely reroute

816
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,000
some of that some of that income into like making a game I would love to

817
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,840
actually make a video game you know absolutely that'd be the dream well

818
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:35,400
but uh you know V is V yeah yeah the Romanian guy V yeah yeah yeah oh he is

819
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,040
yeah yeah yeah well he's that he's now making a game oh good for him yeah he's

820
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,520
he's managed to pull it off and I'm like damn you're doing what I've always

821
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,640
wanted to do yeah I mean if I had to choose anything that I would love to do

822
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,120
that would be like a passion project it would be to do a battle tech TV show TV

823
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:56,800
show and I have two these are the projects or several of them that I would

824
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,640
be that I've been working on and the first one would be like set in the

825
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,760
fourth secession war and all that stuff and the second one would be set in the

826
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,840
periphery following a mercenary company and you could set it up as like a you'd

827
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:14,400
pitch it as a Game of Thrones but in space so all the fun jazz that you can

828
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,080
do with that you can have action if you wanted it you could have intrigue if you

829
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,400
wanted it you could there's so many things you can do with it but that would

830
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,900
that would be my rolling you know a lucky seven or just rolling a natural 20

831
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:35,260
how about that analogy if I could do that I would die a happy person so well

832
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,900
okay I think we might have run out of topics to a talk about and also I only

833
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:44,500
have 15 more minutes before I have to go yeah well here's the thing well here's

834
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,740
something that's interesting here I'll go back to more channel awesome one last

835
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:54,540
time to the channel awesome well of course because no offense to Brad Jones

836
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:58,740
I love his stuff but he's he's kind of stagnated a bit I've decided to try to

837
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:03,700
do the midnight screening format okay well you know you hop into a van or you

838
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:08,660
hop into a car and yeah you go talk about it yeah yeah and you're and you

839
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:13,260
know I've done it a few times now and it's actually kind of it's very um not

840
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:18,340
spooky here you know the liminal space is bought it's very liminal yes all

841
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:23,580
right okay okay cuz you're sitting in a car in the middle of an empty parking

842
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,300
lot everyone is gone the city is just dead quiet and you're talking about a

843
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:32,420
movie at 3 a.m. you know it's a very strange it's very fun I know what you're

844
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:36,480
talking about yeah yeah that was one of the downsides of working the the

845
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,300
reviewer stuff that we did where you know when Cara would shoot shows at like

846
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,780
1 in the morning and then we'd go out for grocery shopping at 3 and it's like

847
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:48,860
yeah everybody's asleep right it's this weird yeah that made me wonder about

848
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:52,660
that that idea always sort of stuck with me if you were a vampire right where

849
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,620
you'd see all these stores that you would never be able to go into because

850
01:07:55,620 --> 01:08:00,500
they're closed when you're active so yeah it is a weird liminal feeling it's

851
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:07,380
a very surreal experience it lets the mind wander so yeah I like that kind of

852
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,300
insomnia horror where it's stuff like that that actually reminds me of

853
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:17,840
something uh okay so it's the as I mentioned at the start of this what I

854
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,780
started with was anime reviews it was me and two friends running around with a

855
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:24,380
camera we were we were young and stupid and we wanted to join channel awesome

856
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,300
and never did wait I did tell you the story where I got accepted and then

857
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:33,060
rejected them right yes yes yeah that was like in 2014 or something that was

858
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:38,020
just for fun but um so 2009 we're we're being dumb we're making anime reviews

859
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:45,180
um however two out of the three of us were only back in my hometown for for

860
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:49,020
one summer right okay had to so we had to like write all the scripts and shoot

861
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,580
all of the live-action parts of the episodes over the course of the summer

862
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:57,500
and then we would like edit them over the year right so yeah yeah shot like a

863
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,900
whole bunch of episodes we had it all planned out it was very it was very

864
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,860
ambitious for our very first project doing this together yeah but we did it

865
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:09,940
and we got to the point where we had released so we shot everything in that

866
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:14,060
summer and then we started releasing it in the fall in the winter and the spring

867
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,620
it was very strange shooting the Christmas episode in like July because

868
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:21,260
we were just sweltering but we had you're like you're like pretending to be

869
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,460
cold like wearing robes and like shivering looking out a window and we

870
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:30,140
cut we would cut in like snow later but like it was so hot but the final episode

871
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:36,540
of the season we realized we didn't have some of the shots that we needed oh crap

872
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:43,340
so and and at this point the third person had moved away he had moved out

873
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:47,340
of his parents house we shot the show because two of us were coming to town

874
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:51,500
for seasonal work and the third guy lived there and he was still he was

875
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,140
still he was still living with it with his um his um his parents right yeah

876
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:00,340
yeah he hadn't gone to school yet but basically what was going on was his

877
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:04,540
parents because they they have a boat so they would go Friday to Sunday every

878
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:07,180
weekend they'd go on the boat and they'd you know boat around the Great Lakes

879
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:11,900
because they yep that was nothing um yeah so he always had he hadn't he had

880
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:15,460
so much time alone so we would like every weekend we would redecorate his

881
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:20,820
his living room to be the set of the show and then we put it back but before

882
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,820
his parents got home because his parents did not approve they really didn't

883
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:30,060
approve um okay it was really fun sneak around it was probably not very good but

884
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,140
it was fun um yeah but it's part of the experience it is yeah it is I'm sure

885
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,100
like to do I'm sure if you know you probably have some gorilla filmmaking

886
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,180
experiences that are kind of like this oh yeah yeah yes so we got to a point

887
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:46,900
where we were putting out the final episode and we realized we just we were

888
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,060
missing some key shots like it just wouldn't work and at this point he had

889
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:55,300
moved away so we decided to go back to our home to his hometown and break into

890
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:00,780
his parents house I was just about to say yeah break in yes we did we knew

891
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:05,100
where the hidden key was we broke in we like oh my god we we set that we set

892
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,680
everything up we shot the shots that we needed we filmed from like 1 a.m. to

893
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,800
like 5 a.m. because we just didn't want anyone to see us coming in they're

894
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,600
really nosy neighbors the whole thing so broken we uh when we left we like took

895
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,960
all of our garbage with us we didn't leave a single trace of anything we put

896
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:27,720
everything back exactly and then we went back to like my parents house so oh god

897
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,960
that's a fantastic story yeah and then he didn't tell his parents for like like

898
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,560
I think seven or eight years that we had done that you broke into your that's

899
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:43,240
great yeah it was fun do when you're following what you want to do yeah and I

900
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,160
think anyone who's done any sort of like small project gorilla filmmaking knows

901
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,360
exactly the kind of feeling I'm talking about exactly that was that was filming

902
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:56,280
to boldly or suburban nights where you know they don't have permits to any of

903
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,400
this we're walking around in the in the park and all that you know it it's just

904
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,120
okay that's what you have to do running across the the goose shit-covered fields

905
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:09,040
and yeah it's like alright hope that no one like calls the cops and you or hope

906
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,960
no one shows up to tell you to move on exactly exactly did that ever happen to

907
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,680
just did he ever get like you ever get in trouble doing that did anyone ever

908
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:21,000
show no no the police are well the police in Chicago I'm sure have better

909
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,200
things to do but that's you know there were several times though where it's

910
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,080
like okay we have to stop what we're doing because there are people going

911
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:34,640
through right and it's one of the criticisms of dog is like oh there was a

912
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,560
random people that walked by and he was trying to give them like no no don't do

913
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,040
that walk through like this I'm giving you stage no from my experience on that

914
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:49,040
on that shoot we were filming in a couple parks around I think it was

915
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,000
around Easter so a lot of people were out and about and it was super wet and

916
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,960
soggy because you know the reason we were on such a tight film schedules

917
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,200
because we got rained out for a couple days so it is that sort of thing where

918
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:06,440
you know art through adversity a little bit which is where people were feeling

919
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,240
with that shoot but the next one not so much but yeah we never got we never got

920
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,360
thrown out for anything but I think that we did hop the chain fence to get inside

921
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:21,680
of one of the parks early in the morning before it opened so yeah yeah um hey

922
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:25,520
that was just a strange side what I actually wanted to bring up is that I've

923
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,200
decided to start doing um the midnight screenings because I wanted to

924
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,760
experience what it was like and that was always that was always like the show

925
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,960
that I really tuned in for Brad Jones was that was minutes I loved the
