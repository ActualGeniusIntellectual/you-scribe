WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.360
hello hey it's just me today no Lilith okay that's all right it's been a hyper

00:12.360 --> 00:17.040
busy time for me and I basically only have like an hour or two tonight to

00:17.040 --> 00:22.160
squeeze this in that's okay that's okay I appreciate taking the time regardless

00:22.160 --> 00:26.000
and yeah I'm sorry for taking so long to getting back to you it's just things

00:26.000 --> 00:29.960
have been rough right now oh it's everything all right sir oh yeah

00:29.960 --> 00:34.800
everything's fine just very busy okay yeah I know there's there's a lot of I

00:34.800 --> 00:42.200
was like the end of February I was laid off from my job but I found a job like

00:42.200 --> 00:45.920
maybe about a month later so and I know I'm not the only one that's experienced

00:45.920 --> 00:51.440
that so yeah yeah you've you've moved back to the States at this point yeah

00:51.440 --> 00:59.360
sadly COVID I think ruined the economy a bit too far along so you know it being

00:59.360 --> 01:05.080
able to make money is much easier to do than it was on the island so but the

01:05.080 --> 01:09.800
good news is is that everything is pretty solid here I've got my own place

01:09.800 --> 01:14.840
again and bought a car and cash so I can't complain so I mean same here

01:14.840 --> 01:18.720
actually YouTube is doing well enough that I have a car I'm looking to get a

01:18.720 --> 01:23.080
house like it might be yeah things might be okay at least for me yeah yeah you

01:23.080 --> 01:26.080
and me both I mean like I've been waiting or following the market for

01:26.080 --> 01:31.080
years now and it's like given that the interest rates are going up the price is

01:31.080 --> 01:35.000
going to have to correspond with we go down I know we're in a bit of a strange

01:35.000 --> 01:38.620
situation right now but that's the that's the goal because otherwise I'm

01:38.620 --> 01:43.680
gonna have to build a cabin somewhere I mean with any luck it's gonna sound kind

01:43.680 --> 01:47.760
of strange but with any luck there'll be another housing crash like in 2008 and

01:47.800 --> 01:52.320
then the next generation of people can buy houses cheaper you know yeah cuz

01:52.320 --> 01:56.760
like I had a friend of mine who ended up buying a house in like 2009 and he ended

01:56.760 --> 02:01.000
up paying like $87,000 for it in st. Paul and now that house is probably

02:01.000 --> 02:07.280
worth 300 so yeah it's like I yeah yeah you just sort of keep saving keep saving

02:07.280 --> 02:11.640
and then yeah it's now it's like it's I'm priced out so what one nice thing

02:11.640 --> 02:16.080
about being a youtuber is that you have a much higher ceiling it's based just in

02:16.080 --> 02:19.240
your popularity right your popularity so there's some there's some luck

02:19.240 --> 02:23.520
involved there's definitely some skill involved there's some charisma involved

02:23.520 --> 02:28.960
so but it's not like you're you're at a job where you know your union contract

02:28.960 --> 02:32.320
says that you get five raises over the course of ten years and that's it you

02:32.320 --> 02:36.760
know what I mean exactly and and you know we can get into it with the comic

02:36.760 --> 02:40.760
thing but yeah like the free market is a little bit carved up right now as it is

02:40.760 --> 02:44.400
because it's rough out there but yeah it's good to hear that you're growing

02:44.400 --> 02:50.280
and all that I mean I I the whole trans shooting thing I goddamn it's so many

02:50.280 --> 02:53.440
people came out were like Liz you got to make a public statement or something I'm

02:53.440 --> 02:58.120
like what are you talking about a public statement I'm gonna disavow a terrorist

02:58.120 --> 03:04.600
like what is this about it's it's funny because you and I are both from that

03:04.600 --> 03:09.740
previous era of the internet where you know you weren't online all the time you

03:09.740 --> 03:12.840
weren't expected to be online all the time and you didn't have to give a take

03:12.840 --> 03:19.080
on every single news story that hit yeah yeah but for some reason like every like

03:19.080 --> 03:25.640
because it's a trans shooter and it's like I I have to you know what I don't

03:25.640 --> 03:28.600
get I don't get people's mindset anymore I think people are just poisoned with

03:28.600 --> 03:34.280
group politics so it's like what do you want I I don't identify with any of

03:34.280 --> 03:40.200
these people they're they're crazy you know they're in a cult yeah so why

03:40.200 --> 03:46.800
would I number one stick my neck out for me I know that I'm I'm basically a

03:46.800 --> 03:51.500
broken record at this point but one big reason that I was a leftist in the early

03:51.500 --> 03:57.520
2000s is because the left back then was highly individualistic and now it's not

03:57.520 --> 04:04.440
it's yes we changed absolutely like I I used to be on the left as well too and

04:04.440 --> 04:10.180
in part because the right had the the pearl clutching tipper gore variety type

04:10.180 --> 04:13.620
that were always wanting to take away everything that I thought was cool I

04:13.620 --> 04:18.820
love Dungeons & Dragons I left heavy metal I loved video games and they were

04:18.820 --> 04:23.940
always like oh yeah well you can't have that you can't have that and it's like

04:23.940 --> 04:28.220
well screw you I freedom is great freedom of speech is great and it was

04:28.220 --> 04:31.980
what it was all about and now it's the opposite now it's you can't do anything

04:31.980 --> 04:36.740
that that doesn't toe the line of whatever insane thing we've decided now

04:37.140 --> 04:43.220
I mean in Canada we really didn't have quite the same level of right-wing

04:43.220 --> 04:49.140
crazies that you guys did yeah I do I do remember watching like old spoonie

04:49.140 --> 04:52.940
videos to bring it to bring it back to your era of the internet and your

04:52.940 --> 04:56.820
section of the internet I remember watching old spoonie videos where he

04:56.820 --> 05:01.380
would talk about the problems that he had playing like D&D and magic cards in

05:01.380 --> 05:05.940
school and playing video games and I had the same issue yeah yeah I had my books

05:05.940 --> 05:11.700
confiscated and by my global studies teacher who was convinced that I and

05:11.700 --> 05:16.420
and like sat down with me is like is everything okay you talking about why

05:16.420 --> 05:19.540
did you take my books away fortunately I had another teacher who was cool but got

05:19.540 --> 05:23.260
them back for me because he was also a geeky geeky guy that played Dungeons &

05:23.260 --> 05:31.140
Dragons but yeah yeah like like the 700 Club era you know yeah no no that was

05:31.140 --> 05:34.100
very much a thing now granted spoonie Granite grew up in like you know

05:34.100 --> 05:37.300
Arizona Utah and that kind of a Southwest with that but even up north

05:37.300 --> 05:41.380
even up in a quote-unquote liberal state there were still teachers that were like

05:41.380 --> 05:45.380
no well we have to confiscate you know any questionable material because it

05:45.380 --> 05:52.300
might corrupt you somehow so yeah yeah for me basically I I just I skipped

05:52.300 --> 05:55.820
school a lot I just played a lot of video games kind of on my own with my

05:55.820 --> 06:00.620
friends you know mm-hmm I was never the guy to like bring a game boy to school

06:00.620 --> 06:04.700
cuz I didn't want getting swiped by somebody else like a bigger kid so I

06:04.700 --> 06:08.980
kind of but I still would like you know what I know that no one likes video

06:08.980 --> 06:12.740
games and I got I definitely got teased and bullied for being a gamer when I was

06:12.740 --> 06:18.100
when I was young exactly exactly that was taboo that was not oh and now and

06:18.100 --> 06:23.620
now gamers are you know right wing right there right wing gamer gate Nazis now

06:23.620 --> 06:27.980
that's what they oh it's like everything goes back to gamer gate and I know given

06:27.980 --> 06:31.660
that the news cycle has made people have an attention span of like a fucking

06:31.660 --> 06:37.180
goldfish at this point but gamer gate was a decade ago like are you guys gonna

06:37.180 --> 06:42.380
get over it like at what point is this you know the I think that was just when

06:42.380 --> 06:47.540
when I think that was the the first real time that anybody told them no yeah it

06:47.540 --> 06:53.140
told them no and it kind of stuck you know cuz it it didn't really stick with

06:53.140 --> 06:58.100
with comics comics game basically lost it didn't really stick with the

06:58.100 --> 07:01.580
tabletop stuff because if you look at that now it's it's definitely been woke

07:01.580 --> 07:08.620
a fine yeah yeah you know atheism became atheism plus you can go to you can go to

07:08.620 --> 07:13.140
like old early internet rationalist spaces like the rationalist wiki now

07:13.140 --> 07:20.620
sorry you know but but gaming I made a video on this a year ago my hypothesis

07:20.620 --> 07:27.460
is that because gaming is inherently competitive there has to be some sort of

07:27.460 --> 07:31.900
meritocratic aspect to it and that and that basically provided a bulwark

07:31.900 --> 07:36.700
against let's say this sort of hyper woke stuff from really seeping in too

07:36.700 --> 07:40.900
much and that's why if you look at you know really woke games they're walking

07:40.900 --> 07:44.060
simulators and you know what there's actually some pretty decent walking

07:44.060 --> 07:46.820
simulators like I'm not gonna like I like visual novels I like you know a

07:46.820 --> 07:50.820
quick point-and-click games investigative games like there's there's

07:50.820 --> 07:56.140
a place for those yeah yeah but uh man the people I don't know if you if you

07:56.140 --> 07:59.260
saw this but like the Elden Ring discourse or people were complaining it

07:59.260 --> 08:04.180
was too hard and then they framed it as an accessibility thing so it's like well

08:04.180 --> 08:08.900
you're being you're being ableist if the game is right and it's like right what

08:08.900 --> 08:11.940
are you saying about yourself that you're retarded like what's the story

08:12.100 --> 08:17.260
here yeah well it's it's always that the standards have to be lowered and

08:17.260 --> 08:22.260
everything has to cater to my whims yeah they're used to and that's that I think

08:22.260 --> 08:25.980
is in part because of victim culture and you know it used to be that you

08:25.980 --> 08:29.580
celebrated greatness you know the the people who are the top athletes on the

08:29.580 --> 08:35.140
Wheaties boxes right or that was something to aspire to now it's it's the

08:35.140 --> 08:39.580
opposite you don't get claim in accolades for being excellent you get

08:39.580 --> 08:47.580
claim in accolades for being a wuss you know being a an ugly person instead of

08:47.580 --> 08:52.020
being a beautiful person or being a mediocre person instead of greatness you

08:52.020 --> 08:56.620
know but everyone's beautiful now yeah except they're not we know that's not

08:56.620 --> 09:02.340
true yeah and in psychology and selective breeding and the rest of that

09:02.340 --> 09:07.020
stuff yeah I mean try to you can try to push that all you want but you can't

09:07.020 --> 09:12.340
bully men and going on the dates with you so that'll be the next frontier I

09:12.340 --> 09:16.140
can't well that's what they look you know it's already here it's it's like

09:16.140 --> 09:20.540
you you have overweight women saying that oh well it's it's fat phobic to not

09:20.540 --> 09:24.540
going on a date with me and your beauty standards are based on a system of

09:24.540 --> 09:28.500
oppression so I'm going to blackmail you into trying to it's like what are you

09:28.500 --> 09:33.740
doing you're insane you're insane and you do you do see the same thing with

09:33.740 --> 09:37.180
trans women too right where they say well if you if you don't if you don't

09:37.180 --> 09:41.340
like the trans woman's dick that means that you're you're being trans phobic

09:41.340 --> 09:44.260
and it's like well what if I'm just not into guys well she's not a guy it's like

09:44.260 --> 09:48.180
okay I get your point but like I still don't want to have sex with a penis like

09:48.180 --> 09:51.540
that's what a straight guy would say and that's completely fine but now it's

09:51.540 --> 09:56.220
bigoted right or then you know Aiden Peledon actually did an episode about

09:56.220 --> 10:00.580
that many years ago and and it was about you're not entitled to another person's

10:00.580 --> 10:05.820
body yep right and that's that's what it amounts to that it amounts to is to I

10:05.820 --> 10:08.940
want to have sex with you you don't want to have sex with me but you have to

10:08.940 --> 10:14.460
otherwise agree because of reasons it's like yeah know that you you don't have

10:14.460 --> 10:20.180
the right to enslave you don't have the right to another person it's ridiculous

10:20.180 --> 10:25.380
it's like that's used to be but undergoing this path was a series of

10:25.380 --> 10:29.700
opportunity cost choices where it's like you're yeah if you go down this road

10:29.700 --> 10:34.980
even if you're post-op you will have a much reduced dating pool and at least at

10:34.980 --> 10:40.260
the time that was something that people took into effect and they said well it

10:40.260 --> 10:44.620
doesn't matter so much as I have to sort this out otherwise I'm not gonna make it

10:44.620 --> 10:50.220
but now we live in a situation where anybody that has auto gynophilia or has

10:50.220 --> 10:53.940
been sexually groomed or any of these other issues that are so far away from

10:53.940 --> 10:58.460
the estimated one in a hundred and fifty thousand in men and one in a

10:58.460 --> 11:01.940
hundred and three hundred thousand in women which is what the original numbers

11:01.940 --> 11:06.980
were we're so far away from that that those original people have been

11:06.980 --> 11:14.180
overshadowed by a order of magnitude by these new people that are degenerates or

11:14.180 --> 11:19.580
abuse victims yeah well you're seriously like you're gonna be caught between a

11:19.580 --> 11:22.460
rock and a hard place right because there's gonna be a lot of right oids who

11:22.460 --> 11:25.980
would say that's what you are you're degenerate oh I've had that argument

11:25.980 --> 11:31.340
many times I've noticed the the backlash towards trans people especially after

11:31.340 --> 11:36.460
the shooting especially in the past two years you know you're seeing I'm seeing

11:36.460 --> 11:41.900
a lot more of an adoption of left-wing mentality where it's group think it's

11:41.900 --> 11:47.700
it's group this person is this therefore we judge them as that we don't treat

11:47.700 --> 11:51.620
them as an individual anymore there's a movement away from the Goldwater style

11:51.620 --> 11:56.340
Republican that was more libertarian mindset and more personal freedom

11:56.340 --> 12:01.060
mindset and Liberty mindset towards collectivism and I'm seeing that on the

12:01.060 --> 12:05.700
right they're adopting those tactics as well so they like you go on these I've

12:05.700 --> 12:08.500
been around in some of these channels that where they go on these unhinged

12:08.500 --> 12:13.060
rants it's like all trans people should be you know jailed or locked up or

12:13.060 --> 12:18.380
institutionalized or thrown in a closet it with with a Bible and not come out

12:18.380 --> 12:22.180
until it's like they're fixed it's like they're justifying their abuse because

12:22.180 --> 12:28.100
it's you know it's it's reactionary and pissed off thinking and and it's like I

12:28.100 --> 12:31.400
always do the the Grandpa Simpson meme where he's walking into the door of the

12:31.400 --> 12:34.420
strip club and Bart's sitting there at the chair on the chair you know and he

12:34.420 --> 12:39.380
just puts his hat on the rack sees Bart and then walks out and it's that sort of

12:39.380 --> 12:44.780
thing and it's like yeah it's there there's very much that that thinking

12:44.780 --> 12:49.380
and I've seen more and more of it but I think that's just as a it's people are

12:49.380 --> 12:52.580
sick of this stuff there is no compromise there is no different

12:52.580 --> 12:55.980
differentiation between the sex pests and people that are suffering from a

12:55.980 --> 13:01.620
complex medical biological problem right there is no discussion about whether or

13:01.620 --> 13:08.020
not this is Munchausen by proxy with children or whether or not this is

13:08.020 --> 13:12.700
motivated by a corrupt medical industry that gets paid a ton of money to promote

13:12.700 --> 13:16.140
this and if you trans a child you are guaranteed to have an income source for

13:16.140 --> 13:20.220
for the rest of your life or their life there's no discussion about the ethics

13:20.220 --> 13:24.700
of prescribing pymazide which is an anti psychotic that's used in treating

13:24.700 --> 13:29.100
Tourette's syndrome which has been shown to be very effective in treating gender

13:29.100 --> 13:32.860
dysphoria so those who receive it kind of lose that you know there's no

13:32.860 --> 13:37.060
discussion about auto gynophilia or and whether or not this is a sexual kink

13:37.060 --> 13:42.460
versus you know this is a a psychological need to like if it's not

13:42.460 --> 13:46.100
met then then there's really no way out but there's none of this discussion is

13:46.100 --> 13:49.860
going into it you either accept everything in anything or you are the

13:49.860 --> 13:53.860
same moral equivalent of you know dragging a person behind a truck and a

13:53.860 --> 13:58.380
gravel road right or throwing them in a gas chamber and people are sick of that

13:58.380 --> 14:03.340
they're sick of this this this moral extortion game so this is what I've been

14:03.340 --> 14:07.820
working on I've been I've been trying to do a video on everyone says you know

14:07.820 --> 14:12.860
trans ideology or LGBT ideology you know well you know what is that actually and

14:12.860 --> 14:17.900
I've I'm I'm not gonna make a statement on what it is yet I'm gonna wait for my

14:17.900 --> 14:21.020
video to come out because I'm doing a lot of a lot of reading and a lot of

14:21.020 --> 14:26.380
research but one thing that I've kind of unearthed is that there's a section of

14:26.380 --> 14:34.780
the left liberals liberals like me you know non socialists non progressives

14:34.780 --> 14:38.860
just just liberals liberals like me in the classical sense yeah yeah you know I

14:38.860 --> 14:43.660
I was and still am completely on board with with the gay marriage argument

14:43.660 --> 14:47.980
because it was it was an argument from innate biology it's like well you're

14:47.980 --> 14:52.340
born gay or or you can't change being gay however you happen to become gay

14:52.340 --> 14:58.180
right you can't change it you're born this way yeah yeah that's a biological

14:58.180 --> 15:04.820
essentialist argument however the the constant affirmation you can self ideas

15:04.820 --> 15:08.580
whatever you want that's completely against biological essentialism and what

15:08.580 --> 15:12.620
I've as I've been like digging in and reading and looking through things I've

15:12.620 --> 15:19.420
I've discovered that there is a section of a very radical component of the left

15:19.500 --> 15:28.540
where they they never believed in the I was born this way argument they used it

15:28.540 --> 15:35.220
as a tactical deployment to subvert liberals yeah and it's like oh it was

15:35.220 --> 15:38.620
really I saw like that literature I was like oh that's very interesting well see

15:38.620 --> 15:42.540
I view it I view this stuff as just Marxism with another coat of paint you

15:42.540 --> 15:47.060
know Marxism is all about deconstruction and deconstructing established things

15:47.100 --> 15:52.340
right so it deconstructs societal norms it deconstructs you know social

15:52.340 --> 15:57.020
relationships and biology is just another front for them to deconstruct

15:57.020 --> 16:00.940
right there is no such thing as gender as sex there you know like except there

16:00.940 --> 16:05.860
is there are biological differences between the sexes there are you know

16:05.860 --> 16:12.460
evolutionary pressures for that and like you said they've gone from a I was born

16:12.460 --> 16:17.380
this way mindset towards human beings are complete blank slates and if that's

16:17.380 --> 16:21.620
the case then you can then you're essentially supporting the get the you

16:21.620 --> 16:26.060
know then you can pray the gateway right that that is a method that works if

16:26.060 --> 16:30.900
we're just blank slates that are the victims of a authoritarian patriarchal

16:30.900 --> 16:36.220
system that has subverted everything natural or right about ourselves then we

16:36.220 --> 16:41.140
can just create a brand new system from the top down and reprogram human beings

16:41.140 --> 16:45.220
in any way we want and it but it doesn't work that way and it never has

16:45.220 --> 16:50.540
worked that way I think what they like to rely on is the fact that you can't

16:50.540 --> 16:53.380
really be objective which is true because we're all humans and we all

16:53.380 --> 16:57.780
exist only in one location so none of us can actually be objective but they take

16:57.780 --> 17:02.220
that to mean that there is no objective reality outside of any one human's

17:02.220 --> 17:06.100
perception which is obviously false right right moral relativism is yeah

17:06.100 --> 17:10.220
you know you know if if a hundred people look at the same thing and describe the

17:10.260 --> 17:13.820
same thing there's probably something outside of the hundred people that

17:13.820 --> 17:18.580
exists you know it's not just a hundred delusions that happen to line up so

17:18.580 --> 17:24.140
right right right yeah even though we can't really truly access the objective

17:24.140 --> 17:28.060
world and any because our senses are also subjective so we can't access the

17:28.060 --> 17:35.220
objective world but it does exist and so basically a lot of the the biology the

17:35.220 --> 17:39.460
philosophy the morality of a lot of these a lot of these people that say on

17:39.460 --> 17:43.420
the blank slate left it completely falls apart because of that reason you

17:43.420 --> 17:47.780
know what really I think as it's funny you bring this up because I think I

17:47.780 --> 17:53.900
think how we got here to the idea that we're now calling women birthing

17:53.900 --> 18:00.300
persons because is because in the leftist side that or at least the

18:00.300 --> 18:04.980
traditional classical liberal mentality is that it's very much like a just you

18:04.980 --> 18:10.820
do you and and you know live and let live in a lot of ways you know and I

18:10.820 --> 18:17.020
think following most liberal-minded people's good nature it and I've heard

18:17.020 --> 18:22.820
this myself I've heard you know talking to people like being post-op and whatnot

18:22.820 --> 18:28.260
and and I'm like yeah I'm post-op trans post-op trans woman and then they'll

18:28.260 --> 18:33.700
like like well I think you're female it's like okay well that's great but I

18:33.780 --> 18:39.100
think that has gone to a such a degree where it's like no that person if they

18:39.100 --> 18:44.740
identify as trans actually is that way and so when you do that that's where

18:44.740 --> 18:49.100
they say well men can get pregnant too because the trans woman or trans man has

18:49.100 --> 18:55.300
identified himself as being met a man despite having a womb and producing eggs

18:55.300 --> 19:01.420
that doesn't make it's like yeah it's like the the open-mindedness has

19:01.900 --> 19:07.340
resulted in people like having their brain fall out absolutely instead of

19:07.340 --> 19:11.500
differentiating between a person having some dignity and saying okay fine you

19:11.500 --> 19:15.340
know I will treat you the way that you wish to be treated it's gone to well now

19:15.340 --> 19:19.340
we have to completely rewrite language and biology just to pacify a

19:19.340 --> 19:24.620
statistically insignificant populace it's no fuck that yeah it's it's move

19:24.620 --> 19:29.520
it's moved from treat other people polite to you must view them the way

19:29.520 --> 19:33.040
that I want you to view them like inside exactly in the privacy of your

19:33.040 --> 19:39.200
own head yeah right um so I did a video uh it was our trans woman actually woman

19:39.200 --> 19:42.960
that was the that was yes I watched that I watched what you think of it um I

19:42.960 --> 19:49.120
agree with you oh well thank you I do be honest it's not it's not all entirely my

19:49.120 --> 19:51.960
idea um I got a lot of it from dr. Thomas

19:51.960 --> 19:55.160
pagardas is paper on the subject if you read that or if you know what him I

19:55.320 --> 20:03.000
don't know that one no okay um he kind of conception he conceptualized the idea

20:03.000 --> 20:07.640
that because the definition is circular and then of course if you talk to like a

20:07.640 --> 20:10.560
lefty they'll say what who cares the definite circle well it actually matters

20:10.560 --> 20:13.000
that if it's just circle because what that means is that you can't actually

20:13.000 --> 20:18.040
identify what a woman is you can't you can't point to a list of qualities that

20:18.040 --> 20:22.120
woman refers to so if there's no qualities you can't actually have any

20:22.120 --> 20:26.560
woman the woman can't exist which is why this is this is all they don't even

20:26.560 --> 20:31.400
believe that trans women are women they simply use that to backdoor in gender

20:31.400 --> 20:35.160
abolitionism right yeah yeah um but one of the things I pointed out in that

20:35.160 --> 20:40.200
video was that um if we're talking about any other animal aside from humans we

20:40.200 --> 20:43.960
talk about sex we're talking about gamete production we're not talking about

20:43.960 --> 20:47.920
hormones we're not talking about we're not talking about chromosomes we're not

20:47.920 --> 20:50.840
talking about social roles we're talking about gamete production and that's it

20:50.960 --> 20:57.200
and we're also not afraid to point out that you have you know the male of an

20:57.200 --> 21:02.080
animal and the female of an animal and then the neuter of an animal when for

21:02.080 --> 21:07.080
some reason or another they don't produce any gametes mm-hmm and however

21:07.080 --> 21:12.760
once you start talking about humans that that becomes kind of a spicy take when

21:12.760 --> 21:17.960
you say well a trans woman who is post-op isn't male because they don't

21:17.960 --> 21:22.000
produce small gametes and isn't female because they don't produce large gametes

21:22.000 --> 21:25.760
they're neuter because they don't produce any gametes and even though

21:25.760 --> 21:30.440
that's scientifically accurate you will get crucified if you say that right and

21:30.440 --> 21:34.320
moreover too I can't change my chromosomes I also can't change my

21:34.320 --> 21:41.600
skeletal structure or my morphic traits in my musculature so you know I always

21:41.600 --> 21:46.960
I've been saying this now for ages but it's like you know I present myself as

21:46.960 --> 21:52.120
female but technically under biology I'm not and that's not to say that you

21:52.120 --> 21:56.640
can't respect me and treat me as female if that's what I choose to do but it

21:56.640 --> 22:01.120
becomes a level of delusion if you try to suggest that yeah all it takes is

22:01.120 --> 22:04.800
some some hormones and surgery and then we can go bango there you go and

22:04.800 --> 22:13.080
moreover it's it doesn't it's this isn't helping anybody I think at the end of it

22:13.080 --> 22:20.300
because encouraging this stuff even with trainees such as myself there is

22:20.300 --> 22:25.000
it there's such an extremely high rate of suicide is still in the community so

22:25.000 --> 22:30.440
if I were a moral person I would not want to be promoting this in any way

22:30.440 --> 22:35.080
shape or form because I know that maybe inadvertently you create a social

22:35.080 --> 22:40.240
disease maybe inadvertently you create gender dysphoria and when you create

22:40.240 --> 22:43.520
gender dysphoria you are creating something that has a almost a fifty

22:43.520 --> 22:49.400
percent suicide rate well if there is nothing moral or ethical about that if

22:49.400 --> 22:53.080
you happen to believe that more trans people existing is good and less trans

22:53.080 --> 22:56.880
people existing is a trans genocide then you actually might think that creating

22:56.880 --> 23:00.160
more trans people is good and spreading gender dysphoria if it could be spread

23:00.160 --> 23:06.840
is good what you're doing is you're creating more suicides though I mean

23:06.840 --> 23:11.320
they don't care about that at the end of the day right that's the black pill

23:11.320 --> 23:14.480
is that there's a part of the left that just doesn't give a shit about that well

23:14.480 --> 23:20.440
yeah if I if I were a a conspirator really minded person I would suggest

23:20.440 --> 23:26.520
that this is just yet another front towards the leftist mentality that

23:26.520 --> 23:31.160
humans are a cancer on the world and they're they're trying to engineer so

23:31.160 --> 23:36.800
that the birth rates further collapse you know if I were to to go down that

23:36.800 --> 23:40.240
rabbit hole I think this is just yet another thing to try to get people to

23:40.240 --> 23:45.080
not have children and reduce pop global population I don't know about that one

23:45.080 --> 23:49.120
that that one sounds a bit far-fetched to me I honestly I think I think that's

23:49.120 --> 23:52.800
happening you know fast enough without throwing this into the mix exactly I

23:52.800 --> 23:57.800
mean you look at the gym you look at the demographics and in you know in 50 years

23:57.800 --> 24:01.040
yeah the population is naturally going to fall off a cliff there's no need to

24:01.040 --> 24:05.800
tinker with the birth rates or any of that when that's gonna happen naturally

24:05.800 --> 24:15.760
so but it does seem a sense of nihilism or insanity behind it and there's this

24:15.760 --> 24:21.000
is not motivated I think the trans ideology is not motivated by compassion

24:21.000 --> 24:26.640
or empathy or kindness it's in it's motivated by entitlements self

24:26.640 --> 24:34.680
righteousness money and greed this there's there's nothing compassionate

24:34.680 --> 24:39.280
about it like I think if you were truly wanting to help somebody you would be

24:39.280 --> 24:42.480
honest with them and you would have transparency and there's nothing like

24:42.480 --> 24:50.200
that in this in this movement transparency not that that show that was

24:50.200 --> 24:58.000
out there for a while transparent it was the guy from curb your enthusiasm I

24:58.000 --> 25:05.680
think or no is the the the the dad character from what's that arrested

25:05.680 --> 25:15.480
development he played a brands gendered parent and there was a drama show about

25:15.480 --> 25:19.680
that man I so I've been recently watching house I haven't seen house

25:19.680 --> 25:24.960
before okay sure and that was I think it started in what like 2004 2008 or yeah

25:24.960 --> 25:33.000
yeah that was that was yeah before the 2008 collapse yeah yeah and there's a

25:33.000 --> 25:37.920
few trans characters and a few like jokes at the expense of trans people in

25:37.920 --> 25:41.720
that show man you couldn't say that shit on TV today or show what they showed on

25:41.720 --> 25:46.720
TV it was it was funny as fuck but I'm like wow this I'm surprised it's on

25:46.720 --> 25:50.960
it's still on like streaming services in 2023 you know what I mean like Jesus

25:50.960 --> 25:55.600
it's it's so nefarious that you bring that up because I was listening to a

25:55.600 --> 26:00.080
youtuber talk about how I think Jennifer Aniston was saying that you couldn't

26:00.080 --> 26:05.360
make friends as a show anymore because of the cut kind of like 90s humor that

26:05.360 --> 26:09.280
that exists you know like that that's not allowed anymore you're not allowed

26:09.280 --> 26:13.560
like Joey the the guy on that show or he'd be he'd be homophobic and there'd

26:13.560 --> 26:18.160
be you know a mass outrage and it was interesting because the people now that

26:18.360 --> 26:25.520
are writing TV and cinema are because you know like Millennials or or Gen Xers

26:25.520 --> 26:29.800
that grew up with that stuff and were you know laughing at it and having a

26:29.800 --> 26:34.800
grand old time with it but now they're the ones that are saying oh well that's

26:34.800 --> 26:43.840
not allowed so I don't yeah yeah it bothers me that we have very much of the

26:43.840 --> 26:48.480
mindset of oh we have to judge the past on our current sensibilities and more

26:48.480 --> 26:52.920
often than not that leads to you know iconoclastic ideas where it's like oh

26:52.920 --> 26:55.960
well we have to tear down these statues because they're offensive to our

26:55.960 --> 27:00.200
sensibilities now it doesn't matter they've been sitting there for for 150

27:00.200 --> 27:04.360
years or they're a part of the history you know we've we've deigned them impure

27:04.360 --> 27:09.000
they therefore they have to be destroyed just like this is yeah yeah iconoclasts

27:09.000 --> 27:13.960
never are received well in history I've been so this is my good reason what to

27:13.960 --> 27:23.880
because I recall hearing stories of my dad when he was in his teens and 20s

27:23.880 --> 27:28.200
getting into hockey brawls he was a amateur hockey player yeah okay very

27:28.200 --> 27:32.520
Canadian you know yeah yeah yeah oh very cool I'm gonna drink some molesons after

27:32.520 --> 27:39.080
cool yeah but by the time I came along he wasn't that guy anymore he had kind

27:39.080 --> 27:46.080
of settled down right yeah and I recall being like 10 or 11 and I'm at the

27:46.080 --> 27:50.160
knock you know I was younger than that I would have been like 7 or 8 and we were

27:50.160 --> 27:54.480
at the theme park and my dad really wanted me to go on these crazy

27:54.480 --> 27:57.520
rollercoasters with him and I was too young to go and I was like I can't

27:57.520 --> 28:01.840
handle this I'm way too young but then once I'm 16 and 17 we're back at the

28:01.840 --> 28:05.800
same theme park and then my dad won't do it now he's too old nice old right

28:05.800 --> 28:09.920
yeah and he's like well like my tastes have just changed it's like okay wait

28:09.920 --> 28:15.600
and then now I'm thinking like well firstly my tastes now that I'm in my

28:15.600 --> 28:19.080
30s my tastes haven't changed when I was in my teens or 20s I mean they changed a

28:19.080 --> 28:22.480
little bit but like not much I can still like go back and watch jackass or

28:22.480 --> 28:27.920
something or MX yeah you know those old with the edgy shows or um but I realized

28:27.920 --> 28:32.480
that I think what's happened is basically a lot of people my age a lot

28:32.480 --> 28:37.520
of the Millennials they had their fill of edgy content when they were younger

28:37.520 --> 28:42.880
and now that they've grown up and maybe now they're they're a bit older maybe

28:42.880 --> 28:47.360
they have houses or they have partners they have kids or they're they're in

28:47.360 --> 28:51.960
they're in the workforce they're you know out of school by at least a decade

28:51.960 --> 28:56.440
or more now they're like oh well now I'm getting older and I'm becoming more

28:56.440 --> 29:01.640
responsible but I'm still a millennial because the millennial it's a phrase it

29:01.640 --> 29:07.280
has like a certain weight to it you know yeah yeah well I've noticed that like a

29:07.280 --> 29:11.440
lot of people and I'm also guilty of this to it some extent what do my age we

29:11.440 --> 29:15.640
still act like we're the youngest generation but we're not anymore yeah I

29:15.640 --> 29:18.840
don't know if it's with you but it's kind of psychological with me where it

29:18.840 --> 29:24.360
feels like I'm still 25 and I'm not yeah yeah and I think a lot of the reason why

29:24.440 --> 29:29.400
Millennials are they're basically discarding all the humor that they grew

29:29.400 --> 29:34.840
up with in the 90s and the 2000s is because their tastes have changed as a

29:34.840 --> 29:39.640
natural result of growing up and they think that all that all of society

29:39.640 --> 29:44.400
should change with that because they're still the the youngest they're still the

29:44.400 --> 29:48.360
center of society see I think I think it's something different I think it's

29:48.360 --> 29:53.000
sort of a I see you'd mentioned certain milestones that they've gotten you know

29:53.000 --> 29:58.040
they've had relationships or that they have of houses and families and jobs and

29:58.040 --> 30:02.440
whatnot well Millennials are kind of the lost generation in that way

30:02.440 --> 30:08.560
Millennials have a lower participation in the job labor force than Jen Z or

30:08.560 --> 30:14.840
Gen Z does when it comes to a percentage of wealth owned Millennials have the

30:14.840 --> 30:19.900
like the lowest by comparison to boomers and Xers which makes sense but even Gen

30:19.900 --> 30:23.660
Zers have a little bit more wealth to it because fewer of them are going to

30:23.660 --> 30:29.740
college and getting debt-trapped so what I think you have is kind of a quasi

30:29.740 --> 30:34.500
state of arrested development for some and in others it's I don't actually own

30:34.500 --> 30:39.300
anything the kind of work that I'm doing is you know unfulfilling and low paying

30:39.300 --> 30:45.460
and I think maybe there's a sense of a strive for something greater as you get

30:45.460 --> 30:49.420
older certainly you fill that hole with family and relationships and obligations

30:49.460 --> 30:53.980
but if you can't actually achieve those milestones I think maybe it's filled

30:53.980 --> 31:01.940
with with politics or this quasi sense of morality I kind of get that feeling

31:01.940 --> 31:11.700
so well speaking of Millennials writing things yes what an excellent transition

31:11.700 --> 31:17.860
or segue again there's that word again so last time we talked yeah you had

31:17.860 --> 31:22.220
decided you you you opened up some sort of fundraiser was it I forget which one

31:22.220 --> 31:25.740
it was was a go-fund-me or was a Kickstarter it was an Indiegogo actually

31:25.740 --> 31:31.460
right okay sorry sorry yes yes yes you started up an Indiegogo for the first

31:31.460 --> 31:39.340
issue of Linkara's your expert from a long time ago Lightbringer comic and it

31:39.340 --> 31:43.420
was issue one yeah and the from what I remember the Indiegogo was going well

31:43.420 --> 31:49.540
and I don't hit your goal right it's been funded so if yeah the and and I'll

31:49.540 --> 31:53.820
certainly provide you the link to the but you but yeah we funded it the the

31:53.820 --> 31:58.420
first comic is out there no way you haven't sent him a copy because I

31:58.420 --> 32:04.700
suspect you'll just throw it away but yeah we were successful in it so yeah I

32:04.700 --> 32:11.220
I do recall trying to find out what he thought of this well I was telling what

32:11.220 --> 32:15.220
we thought about it and in fact that's kind of one of the motivators that we

32:15.220 --> 32:19.900
have from one of the add-ons on this campaign well so okay so following the

32:19.900 --> 32:23.900
change the channel drama that took place right there was a youtuber by the name

32:23.900 --> 32:29.180
of V infuso and V infuso made a bunch of really good videos that that kind of

32:29.180 --> 32:32.280
chronicled the events as they were unfolding and he spoke directly with

32:32.280 --> 32:39.500
Mars girl obscures Luppa Ollie Brown the HR lady like he was kind of seen very

32:39.500 --> 32:44.180
very well amongst that group so when it came time to kind of announce this this

32:44.180 --> 32:47.380
thing I reached out to him and asked hey would you be willing to go like have a

32:47.380 --> 32:50.340
stream or something that I can talk about it and just sort of catch up from

32:50.340 --> 32:53.940
where we were at is from change the channel he's like oh I'd love to so we

32:53.940 --> 32:59.820
have this stream and from what I understand somebody tweeted Linkara

32:59.820 --> 33:06.660
about it Linkara then flagged it really and yeah he flagged it and I don't know

33:06.660 --> 33:10.860
if he got a strike or not but he flagged it and then on Twitter he called

33:10.860 --> 33:17.540
me a piece of shit so yeah I have the receipts I can dig him up for you but

33:17.540 --> 33:24.740
sure it amounted to he apparently lost a lot of respect for me after I voted for

33:24.740 --> 33:30.060
Trump and he went on this you know mean-spirited rant so seven years ago at

33:30.060 --> 33:37.540
this point Jesus yeah yeah so we we we decided to kind of roll into that spin a

33:37.540 --> 33:44.540
little bit so now we have make light bringer great again hats so we call

33:44.540 --> 33:51.540
amalgam hats so one of the tiers we have is at the top there you know I just like

33:51.540 --> 33:55.740
to so people have asked me so are you gonna send him one it's like again he's

33:55.740 --> 33:59.260
probably gonna throw it away I know there's probably people out there who

33:59.260 --> 34:02.700
would ask to have it signed at a con and would film themselves doing that I

34:02.700 --> 34:06.860
certainly can't you know endorse you doing that or you know I'm not

34:06.860 --> 34:12.180
encouraging you to troll by any stretch but I would like to see the the video if

34:12.180 --> 34:16.700
it were to come out I'm just saying that does the car even go to cons anymore I

34:16.700 --> 34:22.460
mean it's not that I don't know I'm easy well I don't try to follow him for what

34:22.460 --> 34:26.340
he does a lot of the time anything any developments I get about his life are

34:26.460 --> 34:30.060
kind of forwarded to me by third parties because again I can't ever really get

34:30.060 --> 34:35.540
off the internet and I think or get free of the old stuff that I did I think

34:35.540 --> 34:40.220
having realized that it's gotten a lot more expensive with the economy slowing

34:40.220 --> 34:44.120
down and the costs have gone up as compared to last year I'm really

34:44.120 --> 34:47.580
considering getting backing into streaming and or at least doing

34:47.580 --> 34:51.260
something so that I can reestablish myself again so I don't have to you know

34:51.260 --> 34:55.300
hop around on to other people's channels and just sort of get back into it myself

34:55.300 --> 35:00.700
but yeah I know that he did some streaming and he people asked him about

35:00.700 --> 35:05.700
oni plays and he got really upset about it you know they're always making fun of

35:05.700 --> 35:12.220
me and you know he's just not Doug Doug Walker had a redemption arc and I didn't

35:12.220 --> 35:16.660
think that was possible after the change the channel stuff so I got a respect for

35:16.660 --> 35:22.820
it no mad respect for them for Doug he's he's he's managed to clause place back

35:22.820 --> 35:26.940
on the internet and considering how he didn't die after the wall video it's

35:26.940 --> 35:32.820
like the man's not human right like so good good for him so yeah but but

35:32.820 --> 35:37.860
leycarra it just seems like I don't see it getting any better and yeah I wish

35:37.860 --> 35:41.380
him the best I really do I'm not trying to hold grudges but he's he's turned

35:41.380 --> 35:45.980
into this person that that is one of those types we were talking about so

35:45.980 --> 35:50.880
yeah you know I mean it's it's so strange to think that like you know a

35:50.880 --> 35:55.000
decade ago or I guess even more than a decade at this point yeah I really

35:55.000 --> 36:00.320
looked up to channel awesome like I was a I you know the I told you the story

36:00.320 --> 36:04.600
last time you were here but I'll recap it real quick just for the sake of this

36:04.600 --> 36:12.680
video um 2009 I I really liked a VGN and I really really like spoonie and I

36:12.680 --> 36:16.720
wanted to be on channel awesome so so me and my friends were you know running

36:16.720 --> 36:20.080
around the suburbs with that with a with a camera shooting some really dumb

36:20.120 --> 36:25.960
videos didn't really go anywhere yeah and then like I after the the angry

36:25.960 --> 36:28.840
reviewer thing died off I did some let's plays and those kind of gained some

36:28.840 --> 36:32.720
traction and I did some gamergate stuff and that gained a lot of traction and I

36:32.720 --> 36:36.160
made friends with Sargon and I started doing politics and like yeah so I kind

36:36.160 --> 36:40.560
of made my own way and and now like I'm I'm surprisingly bigger than spoonie

36:40.560 --> 36:43.720
when spoonie was the guy that made me not not made me that sweet was the guy

36:43.720 --> 36:48.760
that inspired you yeah yeah it's funny because like you can go back and watch

36:48.760 --> 36:53.240
John Tron's from John Tron's first video and he's like spoonie inspired me

36:53.240 --> 36:57.960
it's like damn yeah yeah and and now all these people are like they're kind of

36:57.960 --> 37:01.800
it's it's it's it's really mean to say but they're kind of like washed up you

37:01.800 --> 37:05.200
know or yeah yeah they've not really gained anything and I think that's one

37:05.200 --> 37:08.440
of the biggest tragedies for the change the channel movement is that you saw the

37:08.440 --> 37:12.840
main players of it and I didn't I guess I didn't realize this at the time but I

37:12.840 --> 37:17.400
came at it as from an angle of yeah they did wrong but now that they've you know

37:17.400 --> 37:22.040
like here's here's the various reasons why but maybe this is gonna be a good

37:22.040 --> 37:27.040
lesson for all of us to kind of hold ourselves to a higher standard you know

37:27.040 --> 37:30.840
now that we have the warning signs of abusers in our midst which is kind of

37:30.840 --> 37:34.640
what the whole G Wario thing was as well as the management was maybe we're not

37:34.640 --> 37:38.080
gonna tolerate this stuff anymore maybe we're gonna use this as an inspiration

37:38.080 --> 37:42.120
for our own works and really strive to become something better but in reality I

37:42.120 --> 37:46.760
think it was just another casualty or at least like a me too equivalency

37:46.760 --> 37:51.440
because now now that it's been so far out there's another youtuber called that

37:51.440 --> 37:57.120
the almighty lolly who did a good kind of breakdown of the document and said

37:57.120 --> 38:00.520
well this isn't support there's no evidence for this claim there's no

38:00.520 --> 38:04.300
evidence for this claim this is hearsay there's that this is one person's opinion

38:04.300 --> 38:08.040
this is one person's like for me I had the receipts like everybody saw me get

38:08.040 --> 38:14.340
my knee kicked in you know we when we posted the the the waiver they had a

38:14.340 --> 38:19.740
sign for oh well we're not you if you get injured on site you know you you

38:19.740 --> 38:22.660
know it's not our fault and we're not gonna help you because we have no

38:22.660 --> 38:26.340
insurance and and you know yeah it's very easy to prove that they didn't have

38:26.340 --> 38:31.300
filming permits for this stuff but that's all that you could like but yeah

38:31.300 --> 38:36.900
so the fact that you were there you saw things and spoke to people and you can't

38:36.900 --> 38:40.420
really reproduce that as evidence you know right and that's what I've said to

38:40.420 --> 38:44.020
where it's like I'm putting my integrity on the line because I literally had I

38:44.020 --> 38:49.180
can't prove that I picked up Juario's phone and you know trying to figure out

38:49.180 --> 38:53.620
whose phone it belonged to it's it had a listing for my wife and my slave in it I

38:53.620 --> 38:58.340
can't prove that so I'm going to come out of the woodwork and say well here's

38:58.340 --> 39:03.060
what I've experienced I have nothing to gain from this and only to stand to lose

39:03.060 --> 39:07.180
on this so if you don't believe me that's fine I get it but that was

39:07.180 --> 39:11.900
actually that I had to do it in in my in the video I recorded today where

39:11.940 --> 39:16.300
basically I had to point out that um if you if you go anywhere on the internet

39:16.300 --> 39:21.340
it's just it's a slight side story it's okay if you go anywhere and you look up

39:21.340 --> 39:26.260
the the phrase cultural Marxism okay you find that it's it's considered you know

39:26.260 --> 39:30.060
an alt-right anti-semitic conspiracy theory and it's it's nazism in there

39:30.060 --> 39:36.580
however you know I was in introductory to critical theory first year university

39:36.580 --> 39:41.060
course in 2007 where the professor said that this was cultural Marxism and I had

39:41.060 --> 39:45.580
a positive connotation and that is you will not find that on the Wikipedia

39:45.580 --> 39:49.180
article not anymore you you could find that you know ten years ago in the

39:49.180 --> 39:53.180
computer article not anymore not not not since Jordan Pearson started talking

39:53.180 --> 39:57.220
about it on his on his YouTube channel you know in like 2016 or whatever it was

39:57.220 --> 40:02.740
so you it's one thing that I've that I've been completely unprepared for as

40:02.740 --> 40:09.860
I've gotten older is hat the way that like younger people or even just

40:09.900 --> 40:15.380
uninformed people or misinformed people will come to me and describe to me

40:15.380 --> 40:22.060
historical events that I was present for right with such like insane inaccuracy

40:22.060 --> 40:26.060
like they're just they're so wrong and they're so sure of themselves and I'm

40:26.060 --> 40:32.740
like I was there that's not how that was you know exactly exactly it's yeah yeah

40:32.740 --> 40:37.220
you're right it there's sort of a weird reprogramming of events or just history

40:37.220 --> 40:40.700
itself which is why it's so horrifying that even when it's as simple as

40:40.700 --> 40:45.260
something with like a rolled doll book or dr. Seuss you know they they go back

40:45.260 --> 40:50.180
and they try to change it that is so yeah that's yeah disgusting that's right

40:50.180 --> 40:57.180
out of 1984 now I completely agree um when it comes to the the channel awesome

40:57.180 --> 41:00.940
stuff I mean you know Doug still doing well Lindsay Ellis still seems to be

41:00.940 --> 41:05.420
doing well angry Joe's doing okay really see I thought she quit the internet I

41:05.420 --> 41:09.620
thought yeah she she got a contract with nebula and so she does content on nebula

41:09.620 --> 41:14.020
now but for her yeah I'm glad to hear that yeah because I know the last time I

41:14.020 --> 41:18.020
looked in her she she kind of she made an oopsie in her fans can't cancel there

41:18.020 --> 41:22.940
so yeah well she kind of cultivated that like lefty can wall and base no kidding

41:22.940 --> 41:27.660
you live by social justice you died by social justice so you know but she kind

41:27.660 --> 41:31.020
of she left YouTube but she got a contract with nebula so she makes videos

41:31.020 --> 41:35.540
on nebula now I've never heard of that thing so I don't know that nebula is

41:35.540 --> 41:39.620
it's like a Netflix service where you pay monthly to get access to the videos

41:39.620 --> 41:43.940
but it's for you total okay legal legal makes videos there Lindsay Ellis makes

41:43.940 --> 41:48.260
videos there okay cool there's a bunch of creators that use it but I don't know

41:48.260 --> 41:51.900
any more outside from those two but it is like a pretty decent stable of people

41:51.900 --> 41:59.380
over there okay yeah I'll have to check it out I was yeah if it's well okay good

41:59.380 --> 42:03.220
yeah every Joe is still relevant to and it's in some ways too but you know I

42:03.220 --> 42:08.460
know like um Brad Jones he's he's kind of like yes grown but he hasn't really

42:08.460 --> 42:12.300
shrunk he's just kind of been doing his own thing in his own sphere but like

42:12.300 --> 42:18.660
aside from those four I think everyone has just collapsed like Linkara has a

42:18.660 --> 42:22.700
subs and spoon he still has a subs and like the VGA guys they still have their

42:22.700 --> 42:26.020
subs but no one watches their stuff anymore you know right their viewership

42:26.220 --> 42:33.980
has gone down and I know that you know one of Linkara's and again there's a

42:33.980 --> 42:39.540
youtuber by the name of Kinky Linky I know who Kinky Linky is yep yep yep and

42:39.540 --> 42:43.340
he kind of chronicles some of the stuff but like there was a message that or a

42:43.340 --> 42:46.660
tweet that that Linkara put out where it's like oh my history of the Power

42:46.660 --> 42:51.500
Rangers made like $500 and oh yeah I'm totally not making it and I'm totally

42:51.500 --> 42:58.380
poor ha ha ha ha I'm doing it but like the fact that yeah the Patreon amount is

42:58.380 --> 43:02.700
really not gotten to like it's certainly not keeping up with inflation the

43:02.700 --> 43:07.500
viewership has gone down I know we had to go to a dental college to get his

43:07.500 --> 43:11.060
wisdom teeth out and you don't do that if you have dental coverage and right

43:11.060 --> 43:15.380
you're like you don't show you what is dental college so the dental college is

43:15.380 --> 43:19.060
okay so you go to a dentist to get your wisdom teeth out right you need an

43:19.060 --> 43:24.340
orthodontist yet that right well dental college is just like that where if

43:24.340 --> 43:30.180
you're an aspiring dentist or oral hygienist or or any of that stuff you

43:30.180 --> 43:34.500
go there and you act as sort of like a practice guinea pig for the the learning

43:34.500 --> 43:38.660
students and it's at a reduced cost of course because they're less professional

43:38.660 --> 43:44.780
okay and yeah all right yeah yeah it's the sort of thing you do where if you

43:44.780 --> 43:50.380
don't have dental coverage do stuff like that or if you can't afford the

43:50.380 --> 43:54.580
painkillers afterward you you just take a bunch extra strength Tylenol right

43:54.580 --> 43:59.260
like you can't afford the the Percocet or whatever it is they give you and the

43:59.260 --> 44:02.620
big one for like I know this is a little bit old but like there was a point in

44:02.620 --> 44:06.920
time where he shilled his fans for $7,000 to pay his taxes like a like a

44:06.920 --> 44:11.220
few days before they were due it's like you're not in a good place if you're

44:11.220 --> 44:14.500
doing stuff like that and I'm not saying that to be petty or spiteful

44:14.500 --> 44:18.860
spiteful or vindictive despite everything Linkara does have a great

44:18.860 --> 44:25.500
work ethic you know he does his videos on a very clockwork basis but at this

44:25.500 --> 44:30.820
stage every and you probably know this as well too the youtubers really only

44:30.820 --> 44:34.780
have three to five years of their golden years and then they just sort of are on

44:34.780 --> 44:38.620
decline or they're struggling for relevance I think he should have gotten

44:38.620 --> 44:41.980
off the wagon a while ago and just tried to find either work in the

44:41.980 --> 44:47.100
industry or recommitted himself to more of a day job because at least in a day

44:47.100 --> 44:51.940
job you have paid time off you have health and medical insurance benefits

44:51.940 --> 44:56.900
you have a 401k stuff and you know your your rates are at least competitive to

44:56.900 --> 45:01.700
the market so you're you'll compare pay rates five years ago where they are now

45:01.700 --> 45:05.620
and they are higher because of inflation and because of other economic pressures

45:05.620 --> 45:09.060
you really only get a pay rate if you can get more subscribers more viewers

45:09.060 --> 45:15.860
or more patrons yeah and now easy to do I think that that's kind of true a lot

45:15.860 --> 45:19.420
of youtubers do fall into that trap where they they go through a boom and

45:19.420 --> 45:22.180
then they're now they have a bunch of subs but no one's really tuning in

45:22.180 --> 45:25.260
anymore they're all dead subs and they're wondering like hey I have like a

45:25.260 --> 45:29.100
500,000 sub channel how come I get you know five viewers a stream or how come I

45:29.100 --> 45:35.060
get like a thousand viewers a video however I do think at this point

45:35.060 --> 45:39.580
youtubing as a career has been developed enough that I think we know how to get

45:39.580 --> 45:43.140
out of that trap okay what are your thoughts on it I'm genuinely curious

45:43.140 --> 45:47.940
well you can you can see like you see guys like destiny for example or he like

45:47.940 --> 45:51.340
reinvented himself every few years and that's kind of what kept him going you

45:51.340 --> 45:55.980
know you look at yeah Sargon or red letter media they both decided to turn

45:55.980 --> 45:58.820
like corporate where they started a company they got like a warehouse or

45:59.020 --> 46:03.780
an office and they are they they actually reinvested it didn't just coast

46:03.780 --> 46:07.780
that's how you get out of the trap is if you take you know oh you know a big

46:07.780 --> 46:11.580
payday maybe you get like $5,000 or $10,000 in one month though it's a big

46:11.580 --> 46:17.140
payday you know you don't party it up or you don't like cozy you have you take

46:17.140 --> 46:21.340
that money and maybe you hire somebody maybe you try to expand your business

46:21.340 --> 46:26.180
like there's there's get an editor yeah yeah yeah there's like I'm looking at

46:26.180 --> 46:30.100
this this new crop of streamers who are coming up you know and they're all doing

46:30.100 --> 46:33.380
that now like Chedlogic hired an editor yeah right you got like 500 viewers a

46:33.380 --> 46:36.660
stream but he hired an editor and it's you know it's working out for him um

46:36.660 --> 46:41.900
there's oh man who else who else could I name drop here real quick well yeah no I

46:41.900 --> 46:46.300
agree with you that's that's what separates I think red letter media from

46:46.300 --> 46:50.460
from channel awesome is that they did that they they don't what made red

46:50.460 --> 46:54.140
letter media famous was the most little merciful planker revealer from our

46:55.140 --> 46:59.780
he hasn't done a mr. Plinkett review in years and he's last year he did like the

46:59.780 --> 47:03.420
how little Halloween mini skit but that's about it yeah you're right so so

47:03.420 --> 47:07.420
he's that character is pretty much dead by all intents and purposes but he did

47:07.420 --> 47:13.660
use that theme to create half in the bag to create several movies that they that

47:13.660 --> 47:19.040
they released exactly all this other stuff that they do now a wheel of the

47:19.040 --> 47:23.420
worst now they they've managed to grow it from you know certainly they invested

47:23.420 --> 47:27.260
in their equipment the studios and they they have upped their game but if you

47:27.260 --> 47:30.660
look at the quality of videos that when car is doing it's exactly the same thing

47:30.660 --> 47:37.300
now as it was ten years ago so that's probably I think at some point you have

47:37.300 --> 47:43.540
to stop doing the fight with yourself skits in your living uh-huh right or if

47:43.540 --> 47:47.100
you're if your movie is gonna be you saving the world because what you do is

47:47.100 --> 47:52.740
so important you know I I would love to see maybe not given the original comic

47:53.420 --> 47:57.740
books creation but like if Linkara really did want to break into comics or

47:57.740 --> 48:01.900
get into the industry he should have tried to develop his own comics years

48:01.900 --> 48:06.860
ago and he or he should be doing what I'm doing and you know take either

48:06.860 --> 48:10.220
light bringer or revolution of the mask or some of these other ones that he's

48:10.220 --> 48:15.000
he's done and try to redo them to a more professional degree and see what he can

48:15.000 --> 48:21.900
create he has the audience for it he has the you know he could raise it like I

48:22.140 --> 48:26.420
don't have any doubt that he could hit the targets that I'm aiming for and he'd

48:26.420 --> 48:30.980
probably actually be able to make some money off him too so it's a shame to see

48:30.980 --> 48:35.900
him give up on his own IPs it's a shame to see him you know be this reviewer but

48:35.900 --> 48:40.620
at the same time I do think it's something too smart to be said about

48:40.620 --> 48:44.460
well if you can't create criticize and maybe that's the case if you're right

48:44.460 --> 48:48.820
but that's not to say you can't improve everybody's gonna slam on light bringer

48:48.820 --> 48:54.340
the original one or his his original fantasy novels but but remember that the

48:54.340 --> 48:59.980
original light bringer was made in like what 2007 it's like 15 years ago you as

48:59.980 --> 49:08.300
a writer could have grown by that point how old is he back in 2007 he's probably

49:08.300 --> 49:14.700
gosh he's a few years younger than me so 15 years so probably young 20s or late

49:14.700 --> 49:19.940
teens yeah I know that this point I'm a completely different person from where I

49:19.940 --> 49:23.900
was back then literally and physically and physiologically as well too I might

49:23.900 --> 49:29.140
add so the fact that you can you know if you have some of the the intellectual

49:29.140 --> 49:35.820
humility to try to redo that yeah he was able to successfully raise $60,000 for a

49:35.820 --> 49:40.700
movie why not try to create a comic again if you don't know how to do it

49:40.700 --> 49:45.180
then then do the due diligence do the research treat it like a craft but

49:45.180 --> 49:49.180
you're like you say you're never gonna stagnate and just do the same shtick

49:49.180 --> 49:53.300
anymore it's like yeah I did you hit lightning in a bottle in 2010 but it

49:53.300 --> 50:00.740
ain't 2010 anymore so yeah yeah oh man so actually there was a period of time

50:00.740 --> 50:06.740
where I'd been confusing Linkara with what was his name

50:06.740 --> 50:11.740
Kyle Callahan Oh Kyle Callahan yeah yes was that the

50:11.740 --> 50:17.420
brows held high guy I think so I think so yes I think yeah this is gonna sound

50:17.420 --> 50:20.620
kind of me but there's no real there's no real nice way to say it Linkara's

50:20.620 --> 50:25.380
current girlfriend is that overweight black woman right that's his wife

50:25.380 --> 50:31.380
actually wife now okay yes okay so Kyle has a very similar like looking you know

50:31.380 --> 50:37.860
in shape kind of girlfriend okay and there was yes physique yes there was

50:37.860 --> 50:41.380
actually a controversy I don't know if you remember this with Kyle where and I

50:41.380 --> 50:44.020
thought it was Linkara till I had to like I'd like double-check but it was it

50:44.020 --> 50:52.620
was Kyle um where basically he tweeted out that he hated his life he was

50:52.620 --> 50:58.540
depressed about his relationship and his girlfriend has been forcing him to like

50:58.540 --> 51:04.620
parrot her very progressive politics on his Twitter and on his channel when he

51:04.620 --> 51:09.500
had a channel and that basic because like he had an obligation to make the

51:09.500 --> 51:12.700
world a little bit better with with the platform that he had and that this was

51:12.700 --> 51:16.900
this was one of the main reasons why he basically self-destructed and destroyed

51:16.900 --> 51:21.860
his platform and he hated her for it and these tweets you know she put them out

51:21.860 --> 51:26.620
they didn't really go viral because he doesn't have that reach anymore no one

51:26.620 --> 51:30.100
cares about channel awesome anymore but people noticed and then they were they

51:30.100 --> 51:34.340
were like quickly deleted you know mm-hmm and yet no over time that story

51:34.340 --> 51:39.940
kind of morphed into Linkara but it was actually Kyle well two things first with

51:39.940 --> 51:44.100
Kyle is that the the limited information or interaction I had with him he always

51:44.100 --> 51:48.340
seemed like a very unhappy person I don't I really do have a lot of empathy

51:48.340 --> 51:52.000
for him because having suffered from depression and I'm sure you've been in

51:52.000 --> 51:56.140
your low points as well too you know it sounded as though he had some really bad

51:56.140 --> 52:00.020
situations with some of the people he dated I think you know I don't want to

52:00.020 --> 52:03.420
air any dirty laundry or anything but yeah he seemed like somebody that really

52:03.420 --> 52:07.260
needed to kind of take a step back and re-examine where he was going so it's

52:07.260 --> 52:11.580
not surprising to me that he tweeted that because yeah he was also very much

52:11.580 --> 52:16.860
inundated with social justice when when it was still kind of getting started or

52:16.860 --> 52:21.340
at least when I was noticing it which I guess are two separate things yeah the

52:21.340 --> 52:25.660
other thing though with with so Linkara's wife that deep lore goes down

52:25.660 --> 52:33.740
so okay the when I broke up with with Linkara we kind of or you know we ended

52:33.740 --> 52:39.820
our relationship and I did that she was actually a superfan of his she managed

52:39.820 --> 52:46.540
one of the tumblr accounts for it is this like that like an April von Lon

52:46.540 --> 52:51.300
situation where like you don't don't hate the fans do not date yeah it kind

52:51.300 --> 52:56.100
of is where but she she actually married him he married her I don't know I don't

52:56.100 --> 53:00.980
know the specifics but she went to started going to he she figured out all

53:00.980 --> 53:04.100
the conventions he was going to and started to kind of go to the same ones

53:04.100 --> 53:09.660
that he went so she could kind of insert herself into this and that sounds yeah

53:09.660 --> 53:15.340
yeah I had a mutual friend of mine that worked on a she worked as a person on

53:15.340 --> 53:21.020
Linkara's production for his movie she also managed I think his Twitter she

53:21.020 --> 53:24.060
she was connected with him and she did some work for him she was paid for it

53:24.060 --> 53:28.820
too so but she was starting to warn him about her because she had something of a

53:28.820 --> 53:33.980
double you know a public face and a private face and she was you know very

53:33.980 --> 53:38.660
aggressive towards this this lady who was female and all that and she was

53:38.660 --> 53:41.420
trying to warn him about it but he wouldn't really listen to it and I

53:41.460 --> 53:45.860
remember meeting her for the first time she did like a size you up sort of look

53:45.860 --> 53:50.060
and I thought that was really weird and I'm like and then she got really kind of

53:50.060 --> 53:55.540
like PDA on Linkara and I'm like honey you don't need to worry about that I'm

53:55.540 --> 54:00.260
not here to steal your man I'm not I'm just you know how many how many years

54:00.260 --> 54:06.940
after you'd broken up was this oh gosh probably four or five it was a while I

54:06.940 --> 54:10.580
mean it was beyond it was after my surgery it was it was beyond that point

54:10.740 --> 54:17.700
and you know I thought that was really strange and again I don't want to go

54:17.700 --> 54:23.860
into specifics just made like I should given how nasty he's been to me I feel

54:23.860 --> 54:27.060
as though I probably should drag him through the mud a little bit but I still

54:27.060 --> 54:32.540
think it's not classy to talk about some some stuff but regardless of the fact he

54:32.540 --> 54:37.300
ended up marrying her they live together they do their thing I don't think they

54:37.300 --> 54:42.580
get along well with or her parents approve of that situation I know his

54:42.580 --> 54:49.860
when cars own mother is is she's very pro-trump and I think they don't speak

54:49.860 --> 54:56.500
or on or are on good terms and some of the kinky-linky videos or people that

54:56.500 --> 54:59.780
are kind of associated with that like there used to be a point and I've kind

54:59.780 --> 55:02.300
of noticed this too like there used to be a point in time when we were dating

55:02.300 --> 55:05.580
that he was very much like that he didn't want to be like oh I'm the

55:05.580 --> 55:09.380
Christian kid or anything but he didn't swear willy-nilly he didn't he was

55:09.380 --> 55:13.940
trying to keep it clean right he didn't go on the swearing tangents or whatnot

55:13.940 --> 55:19.180
but that has absolutely changed I think since he got with Vega where he just

55:19.180 --> 55:25.300
goes on these filthy sailor just f you and nasty mean-spirited rants about

55:25.300 --> 55:30.460
people so that that didn't seem like his character back then so I don't know I

55:30.460 --> 55:36.300
I'm not trying to psychoanalyze anybody but one of the reasons I ultimately

55:36.300 --> 55:40.140
decided channel awesome wasn't for me was because people were living in these

55:40.140 --> 55:43.980
egocentric bubbles right you get the feeling like if everybody's telling you

55:43.980 --> 55:47.700
you're great and awesome and amazing you start to think your shit don't stink and

55:47.700 --> 55:51.700
it absolutely does and you should have people that are calling you out for your

55:51.700 --> 55:54.940
nonsense but if you label anybody that calls you out for your nonsense as being

55:54.940 --> 56:00.060
a troll a hater or whatever you're you're you're giving your self an

56:00.060 --> 56:04.140
excuse not to ever have any self-reflection or improve and I think

56:04.140 --> 56:08.660
given his circumstances with his his wife I I get the feeling that there's

56:08.660 --> 56:14.180
probably a lot more of that even worse going on so you know objectivity goes

56:14.180 --> 56:19.740
out the window in that case so but it's a grass like I said the floor goes even

56:19.740 --> 56:26.340
worse well actually I have one question and I'll cut I'll cut this part out if

56:26.340 --> 56:32.900
you don't want it publicly so yeah but this is okay but still I'll cut it out

56:32.900 --> 56:39.020
if you want it if you want to cut it okay no problem what considering that

56:39.020 --> 56:43.300
Linkara's mother was you know very very Christian it sounds like and like you

56:43.300 --> 56:49.720
know voted Trump and all that how did she react to you we don't know or I don't

56:49.720 --> 56:54.760
know because here's what I'll say about Linkara's parents is they never ever

56:54.760 --> 57:00.080
treated me any less than being very kind and equitable and friendly and supportive

57:00.080 --> 57:06.680
and I'm I'm sure that conversation happened at some point and I don't know

57:06.680 --> 57:13.440
when it happened but Avanel was nothing but kind to me and in fact the there was

57:13.440 --> 57:16.480
there was a point in time when we were still kind of starting to date right or

57:16.480 --> 57:21.880
just early in the relationship and his brother got bought a house he and his

57:21.880 --> 57:25.120
wife bought a house and there was you know there's some old they needed some

57:25.120 --> 57:28.040
help with some renovations there's this old disgusting wallpaper and I remember

57:28.040 --> 57:32.640
having like this this like humidifier gun thing that you just sort of ran

57:32.640 --> 57:35.560
against the wall that had a bunch of steam so it would loosen all the glue

57:35.560 --> 57:39.360
and you'd peel it off really kind of gross and disgusting work right so I go

57:39.360 --> 57:42.560
over there and I'm like okay well Linkara is you know doing a little bit

57:42.560 --> 57:46.180
I'm like I'm not just gonna stand around and I'm gonna help you know so I

57:46.740 --> 57:51.740
I go inside of this bedroom and got the the the thing to peel the wallpaper off

57:51.740 --> 57:57.100
the wall and I remember talking to Avanel and she was very very friendly and

57:57.100 --> 58:01.900
sweet to me she was very we talked about you know how I had an investment at the

58:01.900 --> 58:05.980
time that was doing okay despite it being 2009 or whatever it was with the

58:05.980 --> 58:13.580
economy crashed and you know she seemed very supportive now I don't know I don't

58:13.580 --> 58:17.820
want to stick myself in because it's like we we've been not dating for so

58:17.820 --> 58:21.260
such a long time but I get the distinct feeling that she does not approve of

58:21.260 --> 58:26.540
Vega and that ironically she met with she would probably approve of me or did

58:26.540 --> 58:31.700
approve of me back then I don't know but yeah definitively his parents were very

58:31.700 --> 58:35.540
kind to me and I never had any reason like even back then before all this

58:35.540 --> 58:40.620
stuff was mainstream that they didn't treat me like a decent person so okay

58:40.620 --> 58:45.580
funny how that works that was just more for my own curiosity then well see I

58:45.580 --> 58:49.540
would love to like reach out to her and be like hey you know if you want a

58:49.540 --> 58:53.740
Malga hat or your here's your son's IP she might get a kick out of it and you

58:53.740 --> 58:58.420
know I I get the distinct feeling even to this day we the two of us would be

58:58.420 --> 59:01.420
able to sit down and have a great conversation and have a good laugh and

59:01.420 --> 59:08.100
you know there'd be no problems there I don't I don't think at all so hmm yeah

59:08.140 --> 59:12.300
great question though that's the first time anybody's asked me that do you want

59:12.300 --> 59:17.180
me to leave that in okay okay okay that's kind of well it's kind of a

59:17.180 --> 59:21.380
personal question it's up to you I don't care that much yeah well I mean you see

59:21.380 --> 59:25.700
I've gotten more questions where it's like oh so how many times and Linkara go

59:25.700 --> 59:33.180
down on you it's like I'm not it's saying any of that no but yeah it does

59:33.260 --> 59:38.740
make me wonder about what that dynamic looks like but who knows yeah I'm sure

59:38.740 --> 59:46.260
I'm sure as hell not gonna reach out so so yeah you are doing because late

59:46.260 --> 59:51.380
bringer one was successful you're now doing light bringer two that's right so

59:51.380 --> 59:54.900
so I'm not sure when this will get out but we are kind of on the last legs of

59:54.900 --> 01:00:00.740

on to you know I think if we do get out where it's gonna be down to the wire so

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.900
so here's hoping knock on wood that we can because we've we've really upped the

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:23.020
game with this one we the art has gone up a significant notch we have a

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.460
different artist this time because the original artist had his own campaign

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.660
that he did and he got too busy so we had to pick up Dean James and Dean isn't

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.220
he's incredible so you know you can see some of the example pages that we've got

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:42.740
and yeah yeah so how we can absolutely get this going I'd love to see it be

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:49.380
realized so how how does it actually work like if you don't hit your 6700 do

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.540
you lose all the money or like what's the actual yeah it more or less gets

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:57.580
refunded back so they have they have two options right so they have it where

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.580
and this is where your reputation has to be sterling with it where you have two

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:05.060
options where if you don't hit your goal everything gets refunded in the washes

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.260
you have the second option where even if you don't get your goal you kind of keep

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:13.620
what you were able to raise the downside though is that that option has been sort

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:18.380
of abused by enough people where people are kind of sketchy if you are wary to

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.520
back that just because a lot of people or at least enough in the past took the

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.840
money and ran and never produced anything right so you know the last

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.120
thing I want to ever do is take people's money and then not produce anything

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.840
about anything I put my name on I want to have to be the highest level that I

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.640
can manage with it so I'm not sure we'll have to talk I'll have to talk with

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.800
Anthony my producer about it where maybe we can try to see if we can figure it

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:49.160
out a way to still do it or have it go to fulfillment or or what needs to be

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:54.160
done to we're very close we're less than 1,500 there so it's still within the

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.920
realm of possibility that we can get it through so all right well but yeah I

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.600
appreciate you taking the time and allowing me to shill my shit on your

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:09.200
street videos of course of course I mean I've listen I've as you know when I was

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.920
that when I was a youngster I really enjoyed the the channel awesome ecosystem

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.600
yeah and and now that I'm like it's it's never gonna be not strange that I'm

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.480
bigger than some of my heroes when I was younger you know it's always gonna be a

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.280
weird feeling so yeah and you never know I maybe one day I can get back up on

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.440
that horse I do have other projects I'm working on you know part of the part of

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:41.480
the the homework I put for myself was to up my writing style or my skill in it so

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:49.080
I started I've been working on some TV TV pilot episodes I've a friend of mine

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.360
and I are working on a movie script too so you know I'm not saying it'll amount

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.800
to anything but I am trying to still chase that skill set so that what if and

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.600
when opportunity strikes I'll be ready so yeah and you know you could always

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.320
just play you could always just play your identity go to Hollywood you're

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.760
trans you'll get right in there I mean yeah it's it's about who you know so

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.420
yeah yeah it is nice to be to refer to myself though is like an established

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.440
writer though I were you we were an author I got like bringer one out there

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:29.960
and I see this thing as a as a 24 issue arc or season like this whole thing that

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:34.240
I have in my mind definitely this first story is gonna be a three-parter so we I

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.400
come hell or high water even if we can't get it done and it turns into a

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.480
vanity project I still want to do it because the last one of my personal

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.800
failings in the channel awesome day was that I would start things and not finish

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.080
them so even if it cost me money even if I don't make any money off of it I still

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.920
believe enough in light bringer just to want to see it shine so yeah yeah I know

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:01.680
exactly you know I mm-hmm I've man when I was you know in high school I was like

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.040
programming video games always wanted to make my own games ended up you know

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.080
that got swept away just by life because like I went through so many just other

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.640
phases of what I was doing but man if I could get to like a million subs on

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.800
YouTube who knows if I don't happen but if it did I would definitely reroute

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.000
some of that some of that income into like making a game I would love to

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.840
actually make a video game you know absolutely that'd be the dream well

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:35.400
but uh you know V is V yeah yeah the Romanian guy V yeah yeah yeah oh he is

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:41.040
yeah yeah yeah well he's that he's now making a game oh good for him yeah he's

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.520
he's managed to pull it off and I'm like damn you're doing what I've always

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:47.640
wanted to do yeah I mean if I had to choose anything that I would love to do

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.120
that would be like a passion project it would be to do a battle tech TV show TV

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.800
show and I have two these are the projects or several of them that I would

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.640
be that I've been working on and the first one would be like set in the

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.760
fourth secession war and all that stuff and the second one would be set in the

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.840
periphery following a mercenary company and you could set it up as like a you'd

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:14.400
pitch it as a Game of Thrones but in space so all the fun jazz that you can

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.080
do with that you can have action if you wanted it you could have intrigue if you

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.400
wanted it you could there's so many things you can do with it but that would

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:25.900
that would be my rolling you know a lucky seven or just rolling a natural 20

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:35.260
how about that analogy if I could do that I would die a happy person so well

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.900
okay I think we might have run out of topics to a talk about and also I only

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:44.500
have 15 more minutes before I have to go yeah well here's the thing well here's

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.740
something that's interesting here I'll go back to more channel awesome one last

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:54.540
time to the channel awesome well of course because no offense to Brad Jones

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:58.740
I love his stuff but he's he's kind of stagnated a bit I've decided to try to

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:03.700
do the midnight screening format okay well you know you hop into a van or you

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:08.660
hop into a car and yeah you go talk about it yeah yeah and you're and you

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:13.260
know I've done it a few times now and it's actually kind of it's very um not

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:18.340
spooky here you know the liminal space is bought it's very liminal yes all

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:23.580
right okay okay cuz you're sitting in a car in the middle of an empty parking

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:28.300
lot everyone is gone the city is just dead quiet and you're talking about a

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:32.420
movie at 3 a.m. you know it's a very strange it's very fun I know what you're

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:36.480
talking about yeah yeah that was one of the downsides of working the the

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.300
reviewer stuff that we did where you know when Cara would shoot shows at like

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.780
1 in the morning and then we'd go out for grocery shopping at 3 and it's like

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.860
yeah everybody's asleep right it's this weird yeah that made me wonder about

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:52.660
that that idea always sort of stuck with me if you were a vampire right where

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.620
you'd see all these stores that you would never be able to go into because

01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:00.500
they're closed when you're active so yeah it is a weird liminal feeling it's

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:07.380
a very surreal experience it lets the mind wander so yeah I like that kind of

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:11.300
insomnia horror where it's stuff like that that actually reminds me of

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:17.840
something uh okay so it's the as I mentioned at the start of this what I

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.780
started with was anime reviews it was me and two friends running around with a

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:24.380
camera we were we were young and stupid and we wanted to join channel awesome

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:28.300
and never did wait I did tell you the story where I got accepted and then

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:33.060
rejected them right yes yes yeah that was like in 2014 or something that was

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:38.020
just for fun but um so 2009 we're we're being dumb we're making anime reviews

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:45.180
um however two out of the three of us were only back in my hometown for for

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:49.020
one summer right okay had to so we had to like write all the scripts and shoot

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.580
all of the live-action parts of the episodes over the course of the summer

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:57.500
and then we would like edit them over the year right so yeah yeah shot like a

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.900
whole bunch of episodes we had it all planned out it was very it was very

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.860
ambitious for our very first project doing this together yeah but we did it

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.940
and we got to the point where we had released so we shot everything in that

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:14.060
summer and then we started releasing it in the fall in the winter and the spring

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:17.620
it was very strange shooting the Christmas episode in like July because

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:21.260
we were just sweltering but we had you're like you're like pretending to be

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.460
cold like wearing robes and like shivering looking out a window and we

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:30.140
cut we would cut in like snow later but like it was so hot but the final episode

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:36.540
of the season we realized we didn't have some of the shots that we needed oh crap

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:43.340
so and and at this point the third person had moved away he had moved out

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.340
of his parents house we shot the show because two of us were coming to town

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:51.500
for seasonal work and the third guy lived there and he was still he was

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.140
still he was still living with it with his um his um his parents right yeah

01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:00.340
yeah he hadn't gone to school yet but basically what was going on was his

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.540
parents because they they have a boat so they would go Friday to Sunday every

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:07.180
weekend they'd go on the boat and they'd you know boat around the Great Lakes

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:11.900
because they yep that was nothing um yeah so he always had he hadn't he had

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.460
so much time alone so we would like every weekend we would redecorate his

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:20.820
his living room to be the set of the show and then we put it back but before

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.820
his parents got home because his parents did not approve they really didn't

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:30.060
approve um okay it was really fun sneak around it was probably not very good but

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:34.140
it was fun um yeah but it's part of the experience it is yeah it is I'm sure

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.100
like to do I'm sure if you know you probably have some gorilla filmmaking

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.180
experiences that are kind of like this oh yeah yeah yes so we got to a point

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.900
where we were putting out the final episode and we realized we just we were

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.060
missing some key shots like it just wouldn't work and at this point he had

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:55.300
moved away so we decided to go back to our home to his hometown and break into

01:10:55.300 --> 01:11:00.780
his parents house I was just about to say yeah break in yes we did we knew

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.100
where the hidden key was we broke in we like oh my god we we set that we set

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:09.680
everything up we shot the shots that we needed we filmed from like 1 a.m. to

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.800
like 5 a.m. because we just didn't want anyone to see us coming in they're

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.600
really nosy neighbors the whole thing so broken we uh when we left we like took

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.960
all of our garbage with us we didn't leave a single trace of anything we put

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:27.720
everything back exactly and then we went back to like my parents house so oh god

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.960
that's a fantastic story yeah and then he didn't tell his parents for like like

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.560
I think seven or eight years that we had done that you broke into your that's

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.240
great yeah it was fun do when you're following what you want to do yeah and I

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.160
think anyone who's done any sort of like small project gorilla filmmaking knows

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.360
exactly the kind of feeling I'm talking about exactly that was that was filming

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.280
to boldly or suburban nights where you know they don't have permits to any of

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.400
this we're walking around in the in the park and all that you know it it's just

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:05.120
okay that's what you have to do running across the the goose shit-covered fields

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:09.040
and yeah it's like alright hope that no one like calls the cops and you or hope

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.960
no one shows up to tell you to move on exactly exactly did that ever happen to

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.680
just did he ever get like you ever get in trouble doing that did anyone ever

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.000
show no no the police are well the police in Chicago I'm sure have better

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.200
things to do but that's you know there were several times though where it's

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.080
like okay we have to stop what we're doing because there are people going

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:34.640
through right and it's one of the criticisms of dog is like oh there was a

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.560
random people that walked by and he was trying to give them like no no don't do

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.040
that walk through like this I'm giving you stage no from my experience on that

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:49.040
on that shoot we were filming in a couple parks around I think it was

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.000
around Easter so a lot of people were out and about and it was super wet and

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.960
soggy because you know the reason we were on such a tight film schedules

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.200
because we got rained out for a couple days so it is that sort of thing where

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.440
you know art through adversity a little bit which is where people were feeling

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.240
with that shoot but the next one not so much but yeah we never got we never got

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.360
thrown out for anything but I think that we did hop the chain fence to get inside

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:21.680
of one of the parks early in the morning before it opened so yeah yeah um hey

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.520
that was just a strange side what I actually wanted to bring up is that I've

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.200
decided to start doing um the midnight screenings because I wanted to

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.760
experience what it was like and that was always that was always like the show

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.960
that I really tuned in for Brad Jones was that was minutes I loved the

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.680
screenings even more than cinema snob um and actually I'm going to do that in

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:45.280
about 15 minutes with my girlfriend and some friends of mine because we're

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:52.080
watching the Mario movie tonight so oh well watch you I'll watch you what you

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.160
have to say oh well it's opening it's already open so but we're going to like

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.240
the latest possible show so you can try to get that same feel so that that's why

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.320
