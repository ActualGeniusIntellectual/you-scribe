00:00.000 --> 00:16.160
The problem they have always had with us is irreverence.

00:16.160 --> 00:19.200
Irreverence is the act of making a joke about something that is normally considered to be

00:19.200 --> 00:20.200
serious.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.080
Being irreverent means you're not showing respect for something that is generally respected.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.200
Adults like to use this term as a pejorative.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.840
How dare these kids today not take school or work or the church or the government seriously?

00:31.840 --> 00:34.540
The trend of kids being irreverent isn't exactly new.

00:34.540 --> 00:38.440
As much as tradcons like to pretend that rebellion against the traditional order began its slow

00:38.440 --> 00:42.640
march only in the post-war era, Socrates is known to have famously said,

00:42.640 --> 00:44.660
The children now love luxury.

00:44.660 --> 00:47.100
They have bad manners, contempt for authority.

00:47.100 --> 00:50.820
They show disrespect for elders and love chatter in the place of exercise.

00:50.820 --> 00:53.480
Children are now tyrants, not the servant of households.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.640
They no longer rise when elders enter the room.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.920
They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table,

00:59.920 --> 01:02.720
cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.860
This trend may differ depending on the time period, the culture, the wealth or poverty

01:06.860 --> 01:11.120
of the society in which they live, but I think it's safe to say that the trend is real.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.880
It is in the nature of a child to be irreverent.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.840
I can already hear Sargon's voice echoing in my head, not my kids Dev.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.580
Well, your kids are still in that phase where everything revolves around the parents.

01:21.580 --> 01:25.520
When he's 12 and in the privacy of his friends, I'm sure he will say things about you that

01:25.520 --> 01:27.320
you'd never think he was capable of.

01:27.320 --> 01:32.000
And that's okay, because you did it in the privacy of your friends when you were 12 too.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.040
Every kid says, even if they don't truly mean it, my dad is a hard ass or my mom sucks,

01:37.040 --> 01:38.640
as long as they know they're not going to be caught.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.860
It doesn't mean that your kids hate you, it just means that they're growing into a more

01:41.860 --> 01:45.160
independent phase of life, and they're figuring out its boundaries.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.220
An attitude of irreverence is the discovery mechanism of this process.

01:49.220 --> 01:50.960
When you're a child, you're given rules.

01:50.960 --> 01:55.480
They're not only there to keep you safe, but to, broadly speaking, let you know what

01:55.480 --> 01:57.360
is good and evil in the world.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.380
The teen years, however, are when you test the rules, so that you may discover for yourself

02:01.380 --> 02:03.680
why something is good or evil.

02:03.680 --> 02:07.480
And sometimes, though rarely, you might discover that a rule is legitimately outdated, that

02:07.480 --> 02:11.280
what it guards against is no longer relevant, that the outside world has changed.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.080
For example, it made sense not to eat pork and shellfish in an era of foodborne parasites

02:16.080 --> 02:19.880
and diseases, but in practical terms, that's a problem we've largely figured out nowadays.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.640
I am going to stress, though, testing the rules and discovering they need changing is

02:23.640 --> 02:26.580
a lot less common than most teenagers think.

02:26.580 --> 02:31.560
The 90s and 2000s was an era where irreverence was really considered a positive quality.

02:31.560 --> 02:36.160
Yes, you had the anti-war, free-love, commune-dwelling hippies of the 60s and 70s.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.080
They were certainly irreverent, and garnered their fair share of scorn from the previous

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
generation.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.440
But appreciation for those values and aesthetics that made those decades only came about after

02:45.440 --> 02:46.720
their time had passed.

02:46.720 --> 02:53.360
To contrast, the 90s and 2000s knew exactly what they were, while they were, and it was

02:53.360 --> 02:54.360
irreverent.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.800
The trend certainly got its start in the late 80s, where popular culture began to push child

02:58.800 --> 03:03.560
and teenage protagonists who genuinely did not give a flip about normal responsibilities,

03:03.560 --> 03:09.600
instead opting for hijinks and adventures.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.840
But it was the 90s where everything became that, and every kid wanted to be that.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.760
Who didn't want to be a teenage superhero?

03:15.800 --> 03:19.720
School seemed like an institutionalized joke designed to rob us of our youth, and adulthood

03:19.720 --> 03:21.760
seemed like a gap that we would never be able to bridge.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.320
Of course, everyone bridges it eventually, and as I mentioned in a previous video, if

03:25.320 --> 03:29.800
people's politics change over time, they're more likely to drift more rightward than anything

03:29.800 --> 03:30.800
else.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.260
However, this doesn't happen exactly the same way all the time.

03:33.260 --> 03:37.600
When the conservatism of age begins to bloom, it grows out of the compost of the values

03:37.600 --> 03:39.060
held in youth.

03:39.060 --> 03:42.840
Those hippies eventually became my generation's parents, the dreaded boomers.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.800
And sometimes it's hard for me to square away in my head that today's older Karens were

03:46.800 --> 03:49.260
the same people putting flowers into rifle barrels.

03:49.260 --> 03:54.040
While the hippies certainly had their socialist positions, they were also staunch individualists

03:54.040 --> 03:56.460
in their rejection of the traditional religious collective order.

03:56.460 --> 04:00.880
The GI generation enjoyed the Roaring Twenties, suffered during the Great Depression, and

04:00.880 --> 04:04.900
then fought in World War II, running the gamut from progressive overindulgence to societal

04:04.900 --> 04:06.880
collapse to conservative responsibility.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.200
Meanwhile, my generation, the Millennials, largely rejected the neo-conservatism typical

04:11.200 --> 04:12.200
of the 90s.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.800
From the religious like Pat Robertson, to the censorious like Jack Thompson, to the

04:15.800 --> 04:19.600
corporatist like George Bush, to the insane like Jack Chick.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.040
And as Millennials are aging now, they are expressing their own form of conservatism.

04:24.040 --> 04:28.040
And if the exploration that characterized their youth was steeped in the worship of

04:28.040 --> 04:33.440
youth's own irreverent quality, their conservatism seems to be the complete rejection of irreverence.

04:33.440 --> 04:38.880
Call me a killjoy, but I think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should

04:38.880 --> 04:40.300
be able to enjoy it.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.880
The 90s is known for the creation of three unique types of irreverence.

04:43.880 --> 04:49.180
The first is gross-out humor, snot and shit, farts and burps, throwing up and weird foods

04:49.180 --> 04:51.700
and all manner of tie-dyed mystery slime.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.900
This was the humor of the young millennial kid.

04:53.900 --> 04:57.780
Meanwhile, kids who were a bit older may have had the opportunity to enjoy the second type

04:57.780 --> 05:01.620
of irreverence, which was less visceral, the sarcastic comedy.

05:01.620 --> 05:06.540
Consider The Simpsons, South Park, or a bit later on, Family Guy episodes of the era.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.780
Every joke was allowed.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.700
Every topic could be made fun of.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.580
Every curse word and slur was uttered, even if only past the watershed.

05:13.580 --> 05:17.060
Yeah, some of them were bleeped, but we knew what they were saying.

05:17.060 --> 05:21.640
And beyond just cartoons and comedies, do you think this scene in Die Hard 3 could be

05:21.640 --> 05:22.640
made now?

05:22.640 --> 05:26.500
Certainly not, but I don't recall people saying it was racist back then.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.220
In fact, the point of it is that McClain isn't racist.

05:29.220 --> 05:32.420
He's forced into this situation under threat of a bomb going off.

05:32.420 --> 05:36.600
And the point of the scene, for our purposes outside the movie, is that the 90s had a blanket

05:36.600 --> 05:38.780
default assumption of non-racism.

05:38.780 --> 05:42.740
And he's breaking that assumption openly and explicitly against his will.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.100
And so, we laugh at the situation.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.580
People weren't really screeching and demanding inclusivity and diversity and all the other

05:48.580 --> 05:50.540
buzzwords we hear today back then.

05:50.540 --> 05:53.340
General goodwill among your common citizen was assumed.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.820
The Griller meme was the reality of this era.

05:55.820 --> 05:59.420
Yes, there were still racists, but they were reviled for their stupidity.

05:59.420 --> 06:04.420
And when we noticed them, we called them racists, and others actually understood what that meant.

06:04.420 --> 06:08.560
Because we didn't just throw around that term wantonly, using it to describe anybody

06:08.560 --> 06:11.960
and everybody who disagreed with our views, diluting it to the point that it was no longer

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
useful.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
Thanks for that, Progs.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.040
While The Simpsons has turned into a shambling corpse that should have been cancelled 20

06:17.040 --> 06:20.720
seasons ago, and Family Guy is now run by people openly admitting that the old episodes

06:20.720 --> 06:25.040
are so edgy that they're ashamed of them, South Park continues to be irreverent, even

06:25.040 --> 06:29.120
though the era of 90s irreverence has been replaced by the progressive puritanism of

06:29.120 --> 06:30.120
the current year.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.600
Soccer moms back then were screaming that South Park was turning their kids into little

06:33.600 --> 06:37.920
sociopaths, with those irreverent depictions of Jesus and Satan, and how Saddam Hussein

06:37.920 --> 06:41.320
was hanging around in hell, and how Kenny violently died every episode.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.200
Woke's Golds now are screaming that South Park's continued irreverence, but now towards

06:45.200 --> 06:50.000
modern views of transgenderism and social justice, mirrors that old outrage.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.200
It's kinda like how conservative Christians burned Harry Potter books before, and leftoids

06:54.200 --> 06:55.280
burned them now.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.920
These are both ultimately puritanical reactions to the liberal values of free speech, just

06:59.920 --> 07:01.720
coming from the left instead of the right.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.600
And this is where we get to the core of the matter.

07:03.600 --> 07:08.720
Equality before the law, consent of the governed, freedom to speak and to choose and to think,

07:08.720 --> 07:11.960
these things require a certain degree of irreverence.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.840
We must be able to make fun of public figures and speak controversial things for a liberal

07:15.840 --> 07:17.240
society to function.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.920
Irreverence is not only the culture of the 90s, or the method by which the youth define

07:20.920 --> 07:25.520
themselves, it is also one of the mechanisms by which a free society is actually free.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.840
Which is why the Woke's Gold millennials of today, in reacting against irreverence,

07:29.840 --> 07:32.880
also ultimately end up reacting against freedom itself.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.800
South Park was where I first figured out this connection between the Woke's Gold's aging

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
and neo-puritanism.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.200
I'm a millennial myself.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.040
I am also aging, you zoomers, but I still enjoy irreverent humor, which is probably

07:43.040 --> 07:46.520
the reason why most S.A.W.s my age think I'm childish.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.440
And sure, I'm always going to be a kid at heart, I think that's even healthy on some

07:49.440 --> 07:51.800
level to retain youthful energy and optimism.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.520
But you know, I actually have grown up where it counts.

07:54.520 --> 07:59.840
I'm just still an irreverent person because it's a better, more free way to be.

07:59.840 --> 08:05.240
But the people who rebel against irreverence, almost always shed out takes like this, eventually.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.280
Everyone recognizes that Gamergate was a practice run for the resurgence of fascism,

08:09.280 --> 08:12.680
but we don't talk enough about how there's a straight line from South Park to the kind

08:12.680 --> 08:16.840
of online white nationalist humor that gradually became not a joke at all.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.480
When I was a kid, the notion that everyone who was ever offended by anything was an idiot

08:20.480 --> 08:24.760
had common currency, and fortunately all my friends eventually realized that was wrong,

08:24.760 --> 08:28.160
but a lot of people didn't and those people are now Nazis.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.520
You can see it, can't you?

08:29.520 --> 08:33.200
Now that you've heard me ramble about the 90s and irreverence for a while, can you see

08:33.200 --> 08:35.140
what I see in this passage?

08:35.140 --> 08:39.400
This person is reacting against the pop culture of their youth, and decrying others who haven't,

08:39.400 --> 08:41.640
in their view, grown up.

08:41.640 --> 08:46.720
Even though the 90s were culturally, literally so close to the liberal idea of fairness and

08:46.720 --> 08:51.460
freedom that abandoning irreverence means regressing back towards Puritanism.

08:51.460 --> 08:55.400
Their only option to salvage this garbage position is to say that the irreverence didn't

08:55.400 --> 09:00.560
belie a generalized rebellious attitude towards authority, but instead a latent fascism, since

09:00.560 --> 09:04.640
to be irreverent to the current progressive modern culture cannot be framed in any other

09:04.640 --> 09:08.000
way if they want to maintain a semblance of a moral high ground.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.680
Just as D&D players had to be Satan worshippers and gamers had to be school shooters, people

09:12.680 --> 09:15.520
who like edgy jokes have to be Nazis.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.780
It's all out of the Puritans handbook.

09:17.780 --> 09:23.120
In retrospect, it seems impossible to overstate the cultural damage done by South Park, the

09:23.120 --> 09:27.600
show that portrayed earnestness as the only sin, and taught that mockery is the ultimate

09:27.600 --> 09:29.600
inoculation against all criticism.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.100
You have, once again, missed the point.

09:32.100 --> 09:36.020
What South Park teaches is that everything can be mocked, and that it should be.

09:36.020 --> 09:38.200
There should be no sacred cows.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.200
Everyone gets their turn.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.320
It's a shame Ed Sheeran didn't figure it out, but don't worry, I'm sure he got

09:43.320 --> 09:46.160
over his life being ruined with his millions of dollars.

09:46.160 --> 09:50.180
That third type of 90s irreverence that I skipped over earlier, alongside gross out

09:50.180 --> 09:55.020
humor and sarcastic comedy, is probably best described as extreme slapstick.

09:55.020 --> 09:59.780
From prank shows like Punk'd, to stunt and injury shows like MXC, this type of media

09:59.780 --> 10:04.260
was a mixture of real, caught-on-camera style footage with the choreographed stunts of a

10:04.260 --> 10:05.260
traditional movie.

10:05.260 --> 10:07.740
In other words, you were watching action, but it was real.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.860
Skateboard crashes where people really lose a tooth or break a leg.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.180
Actual fights and arguments generally accompanied by a live-league logo in the corner.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.700
Real pranks and trolls on unsuspecting people.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.660
What links all of these things together is authenticity.

10:19.660 --> 10:24.100
Jackass is considered the pinnacle of irreverent culture, as it combined all three types.

10:24.100 --> 10:27.860
Gross out, sarcastic comedy, and extreme slapstick, all in one movie.

10:27.860 --> 10:31.080
I'm actually really surprised that a fourth Jackass movie is on the way, because just

10:31.080 --> 10:34.420
as soccer moms back then said it was inappropriate, what was goals today are probably calling

10:34.420 --> 10:35.420
it problematic.

10:35.420 --> 10:39.340
Within the past year or so, I've recently re-watched all three Jackass movies with friends,

10:39.340 --> 10:42.500
and all I could think throughout them was, there's no way this would get made today.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.180
Everything's gotten so much more repressive since the old days.

10:45.180 --> 10:46.180
MXC, same thing.

10:46.340 --> 10:49.500
There's actually a Twitch channel where all the episodes of MXC are aired on repeat.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.900
And I'm surprised it's still up, because every time I tune in over there, there's

10:52.900 --> 10:55.500
immediately a joke that would never fly on the internet today.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.620
I guess Twitch just hasn't realized it yet.

10:57.620 --> 11:02.820
Uh, we've had reports that one of our prisoners is missing, but don't worry, Guy is on orange

11:02.820 --> 11:07.380
alert and nothing will get by me, Guy, huh?

11:07.380 --> 11:10.380
Hey baby doll.

11:10.380 --> 11:13.140
Ha ha ha ha, Guy likes.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.820
There's a million other examples as well.

11:14.820 --> 11:18.300
Spike advertisements for video games that are overtly sexual are disgusting by today's

11:18.300 --> 11:20.580
woke standards, but they were just normal back then.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.060
Edge sold, simple as that.

11:22.060 --> 11:25.860
And even as the edgy era began to fall out of touch, game companies continued to use

11:25.860 --> 11:29.660
those same tactics, right up until it got them canceled by the game journals of the

11:29.660 --> 11:30.660
day.

11:30.660 --> 11:35.140
Spike TV, the well-known Network for Men that pioneered MXC, also aired many similar

11:35.140 --> 11:38.740
types of shows, stuff that was steeped in all sorts of irreverence.

11:38.740 --> 11:43.140
The early internet also mirrored this attitude, from 4chan to YTMND to Newgrounds.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.700
With eBOMB's world stealing at all, it was all edgy content.

11:46.700 --> 11:51.580
Even though Urban Dictionary is heavily woke-ified nowadays, it was a bastion of Edge 20 years

11:51.580 --> 11:52.580
ago.

11:52.580 --> 11:56.300
And occasionally, some Prague will find an old entry and kick up a big stink on Twitter

11:56.300 --> 12:01.620
about how people used to use the slang, gay fart, to describe a fart that smelled of cum.

12:01.620 --> 12:05.100
As the internet's earliest content creators got off the ground in the mid to late 2000s,

12:05.100 --> 12:08.060
the reverence culture was still in full swing, and it showed.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.940
Tourette's Guy is amazingly, hilariously offensive.

12:10.940 --> 12:14.180
It's the guy who does skits, acting like the worst possible stereotype of somebody

12:14.180 --> 12:15.180
with threats.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.620
This is the kind of stuff that went viral back in 2006.

12:17.620 --> 12:22.380
Angry Video Game Nerd also got his start in this era, and is also a show based in a reverence

12:22.380 --> 12:26.900
culture, incessantly screaming curse words about old Nintendo games, and even real-life

12:26.900 --> 12:31.260
prank calling a hardware store and reviewing Atari porn games in early episodes.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.560
James Rolfe would never do that shit nowadays.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.040
And I personally have extremely vivid memories.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.140
It's been totally scrubbed off the internet by now, I'm sure.

12:38.140 --> 12:39.720
I have a Doug Walker video.

12:39.720 --> 12:40.720
That guy with the glasses.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.720
Channel Awesome.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.760
Five second movie review of Batman and Robin.

12:44.760 --> 12:49.760
And all it is, is a video of his ass hovering over a toilet while a shit log falls out of

12:49.760 --> 12:50.760
it.

12:50.760 --> 12:51.760
Wait, wait, wait.

12:51.760 --> 12:52.760
This is the dev of the future, while editing the video.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.600
I found it on the internet archive, and it's just how I remember it.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.900
I'm not going to put it in the video, I don't want to get banned, but it's in the description.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.320
And holy shit, literally.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.400
The ethics of irreverence really does boil down to, everybody gets a shot.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.540
Every skater kid gets to try the jump.

13:07.540 --> 13:10.120
Everyone gets laughed at when they fail, praised when they succeed.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.260
And given their due for taking a shot regardless of outcome.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.080
Everybody gets pranked, and everybody laughs.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.480
Knowing full well that tomorrow, they will be pranked by today's victim, and laughed

13:18.480 --> 13:19.480
at.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.840
Everybody gets a slur thrown their way, knowing that it's all in jest.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.700
Understanding that differences exist, but not letting them divide or define.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.720
A logical good fit with this ethic is the gamer space.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.280
A community that's competitive and rowdy by its very nature, but ultimately inclusive

13:32.280 --> 13:33.620
as long as you can game.

13:33.620 --> 13:37.120
You can smack talk somebody's race or gender, but in the end, the leaderboard doesn't

13:37.120 --> 13:38.120
lie.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.640
The game unfolds, and rejecting the ethics of irreverence, reject the fairness, the humor,

13:41.640 --> 13:43.260
the camaraderie, and the competition.

13:43.260 --> 13:47.740
Where gamergate began as a gamers are dead styled rejection of gamers, by the anti-gamers

13:47.740 --> 13:52.080
who wheeled their way into power within the gaming space, what gamergate actually was,

13:52.080 --> 13:55.580
underneath all the accusations of sexism, underneath the culture war, was the first

13:55.580 --> 13:57.820
real push of the rejection of irreverence.

13:57.820 --> 14:01.640
And this has finally been directly said, laid out for all to see, eight years later.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.380
Here's a Facebook comment that went viral.

14:03.380 --> 14:06.660
It boggles my fucking mind how we lost gamers to the right.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.900
Feminism is the biggest cause of the decline of gaming.

14:08.900 --> 14:13.220
Microtransactions, loot crates, pay to win, selling games piecemeal, charging full price

14:13.220 --> 14:16.840
for garbage that'll get fixed later, relying on modders, monopolistic growth relying on

14:16.840 --> 14:18.160
removing competition.

14:18.160 --> 14:22.720
Gaming is a microcosm of the failures of capitalism, and all gamers think is, look how feminism

14:22.720 --> 14:24.520
diversity is ruining my video games.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.360
This is actually a somewhat reasonable critique of some of the problems with gaming right

14:27.360 --> 14:30.760
now, but the even more viral reply to this post is jaw dropping.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.720
I'm not going to read it all, it's like a 100 tweet thread, but the full thing is

14:34.720 --> 14:38.460
in the description and worth seeing in detail to understand the brains of these people.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.260
When was the last time you saw a left wing gaming clan?

14:41.260 --> 14:44.860
The reactionary politics is baked into the mechanics, and they're exposed to it at

14:44.860 --> 14:48.740
increasingly younger ages, where their primary social contact is with people who get them

14:48.740 --> 14:50.940
to enforce hierarchies of competition.

14:50.940 --> 14:53.540
Competitive games are designed to attract people who like conquering.

14:53.540 --> 14:58.840
Why do you think 4X games are so prone to fanbases who are viscerally reactionary gamers?

14:58.840 --> 15:03.120
It's in the genre definition, 4X is a colonialism power fantasy, they're on the front lines

15:03.120 --> 15:04.720
of the excess of capitalism.

15:04.720 --> 15:08.760
The only message they receive is, when my guy was in, things were fine, now I have to

15:08.760 --> 15:10.340
be the guy or make the guy.

15:10.340 --> 15:14.180
They need a despot to rule them and tell them what to do, because their entire social hierarchy

15:14.180 --> 15:15.180
depends on it.

15:15.180 --> 15:19.440
If leftists want to convert gamers to leftist politics, they have to do on the ground advocacy

15:19.440 --> 15:23.460
in an engaging way via clans, esport teams, and larger communities.

15:23.460 --> 15:27.500
However, that will always struggle against the fundamental mechanics of these games that

15:27.500 --> 15:29.540
select for this behaviour.

15:29.540 --> 15:33.840
With the lens of, Wokesgold's reject the irreverence of childhood and the ethics behind

15:33.840 --> 15:37.400
it in mind, go back and listen to that passage again.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.720
Do you see what she's saying?

15:39.720 --> 15:43.480
Competition itself is problematic, because the type of person that is competitive rejects

15:43.480 --> 15:47.720
the mass equality of socialism and prefers to climb hierarchies of merit, and because

15:47.720 --> 15:52.500
games are about challenges to overcome, enemies to vanquish, lands to conquer, princesses

15:52.500 --> 15:57.540
to save, puzzles to solve, they will always be challenging, they will always be hierarchical,

15:57.540 --> 15:59.380
and they will always be problematic.

15:59.380 --> 16:04.180
Hammergate was always about a hatred of games, the hatred of gamers was icing on the cake

16:04.180 --> 16:05.240
to these people.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.000
As for why hate games, I can only speculate, but I've had to guess.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.800
It would be that a well-adjusted adult is somebody who, as a child, engaged in play

16:13.800 --> 16:17.280
both solo and with others, and was socialized by that play.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.440
If you want to create damaged, subverted, and undisciplined adults, you must subvert

16:21.440 --> 16:22.440
their play.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.160
Subverting games is one very popular vector to do this with, but they're using Gramsci's

16:26.160 --> 16:28.700
playbook everywhere with the same goal.

16:28.720 --> 16:33.120
Creating irreverence, how it was the youth culture 20 years ago, how it's being rebelled

16:33.120 --> 16:37.800
against now, and why they're rebelling, explains every single Prague movement and talking

16:37.800 --> 16:42.760
point since before gamergate, and the reason I've decided to do this video now is because

16:42.760 --> 16:44.440
of the recent G4 debacle.

16:44.440 --> 16:49.160
G4 launched in 2002 with the express purpose of competing with tech TV, but with programming

16:49.160 --> 16:54.260
aimed at MTV's demographics, teens and young adults, and like MTV, it was inundated with

16:54.260 --> 16:55.480
irreverence culture.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.820
And while its programming revolved around video games, computers, and technology, its

16:58.820 --> 17:03.940
tone and style stuck to the skits, pranks, rude jokes, and sex appeal that was popular

17:03.940 --> 17:04.940
at the time.

17:04.940 --> 17:08.020
By 2006, the channel had to broaden its focus to attract viewers.

17:08.020 --> 17:13.260
By 2009, the channel was experiencing significant cutbacks and layoffs, and by 2014, the network

17:13.260 --> 17:17.420
completely closed, having been entirely replaced by YouTubers and streamers online.

17:17.420 --> 17:22.300
But nonetheless, G4 is remembered fondly by its fans, with its flagship show, Attack of

17:22.300 --> 17:24.980
the Show, still adored by gamers.

17:24.980 --> 17:29.120
G4 relaunched on YouTube last year, and their channel is dead, it's a graveyard.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.120
They've got half a million subs, and they get the same views that I do.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.720
Meanwhile, they've got 20 people on staff to pay for it all, plus all their very expensive

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
looking sets.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.900
I can't imagine this thing is making any money.

17:38.900 --> 17:43.160
So when your failing revival of an already failed brand is failing to compete against

17:43.160 --> 17:47.160
the people who replaced you a decade ago, is about to sink again, what is your business

17:47.160 --> 17:48.160
strategy?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.440
Is it to blame the people who should have been your viewers, the people who remember

17:50.440 --> 17:52.560
G4 as a part of their childhood or teen years?

17:52.560 --> 17:56.700
Would you be surprised if the answer to that question is a resounding yes?

17:56.700 --> 18:01.820
But I actually want to talk about something so much more important than Red Dead Online.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.380
Sexism in gaming.

18:03.380 --> 18:17.900
In joining G4, this is a conversation we've been having since a full fucking decade ago,

18:17.900 --> 18:22.440
where Zoe Quinn cheated on Aaron Joni, with two full Greyhound buses worth of people.

18:22.440 --> 18:26.640
And the conversation always goes like this, you suck, your show sucks, and that's why

18:26.640 --> 18:27.640
you get vitriol.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.640
That's it.

18:28.640 --> 18:34.160
Every time G4 is brought up in various channels, even in this YouTube channel, we have the

18:34.160 --> 18:39.500
chat in front of us, I can see you, without a doubt, there will be backlash, because I'm

18:39.500 --> 18:42.160
not as bangable as the previous hosts.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.160
It's somehow-

18:43.160 --> 18:44.680
Talk to him, Frost!

18:44.680 --> 18:49.580
It has somehow been expected that you can talk about how much you jerked off to women

18:49.580 --> 18:50.580
as a compliment.

18:50.580 --> 18:51.580
It's not a compliment!

18:51.580 --> 18:52.580
It's weird!

18:52.580 --> 18:56.320
I'm going to go ahead and be the contrarian once again, and say, you know what, disregarding

18:56.320 --> 18:59.240
her personality of course, that's a pretty big thing to disregard, this girl is actually

18:59.240 --> 19:00.820
kind of cute in her own way.

19:00.820 --> 19:04.760
The blonde, short haired petite girl is certainly a type, it's why so many people were fapping

19:04.760 --> 19:07.660
it to Kes on Voyager or that psychic chick from Judge Dredd.

19:07.660 --> 19:11.460
Suicide Girls was full of tatted up short haired blondes, and this look was for a time

19:11.460 --> 19:14.420
incredibly popular, though maybe this is just me showing my age because the appeal

19:14.420 --> 19:17.140
of Suicide Girls was downstream from a reverence culture.

19:17.140 --> 19:21.040
Um, for you zoomers out there, Suicide Girls was basically a porn site that exclusively

19:21.040 --> 19:24.800
catered to alt girls with tattoos, piercings, and punk hairstyles.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.500
In an era before video streaming, your choices were buying porn DVDs or porn off satellite

19:29.500 --> 19:34.680
TV, downloading porn videos from Kazaa or Limewire, or looking at pictures, and the

19:34.680 --> 19:37.520
only place that was doing alt girls was Suicide Girls.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.220
And fun fact, that's where Zoe Quinn posted her nudes back in the day too.

19:41.260 --> 19:44.900
The point is though, I know very well the aesthetic she's appealing to, and she does

19:44.900 --> 19:47.380
look like she could have made a few bucks in that site back in the day.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.820
Give yourself a bit more credit, girl.

19:48.820 --> 19:54.340
Women do not exist to be nice on the eyes for you, Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not

19:54.340 --> 19:57.180
exist to be nice on the eyes for you.

19:57.180 --> 20:02.340
Oh no, oh no, roll the clips.

20:02.340 --> 20:03.740
Sexism in gaming.

20:03.740 --> 20:04.940
Here we go again.

20:04.940 --> 20:10.060
Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not exist to be nice on the eyes for you.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.100
Oh crap.

20:12.540 --> 20:13.540
Just roll it.

20:30.780 --> 20:34.980
Sexism objectifies women, hates women, sexist, sexism woman.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.660
Half of our producers and writers are women.

20:37.660 --> 20:38.660
Okay, first of all Kevin.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.540
This is not a regulation dog, so you're a raw dog in here.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.780
It's really thick.

20:42.780 --> 20:46.620
What makes this funny as shit is that this is exactly why these women existed.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.620
It's why when Olivia Munn made the jump to the Daily Show, she lasted for a few skits

20:50.620 --> 20:53.940
before disappearing, and nobody even noticing she was there.

20:53.940 --> 20:57.220
It's why Morgan Webb hasn't done a single thing of note since G4 died.

20:57.220 --> 21:00.980
Hell, I know this ain't G4, but back when the first Assassin's Creed dropped in like

21:00.980 --> 21:05.740
2006 or whatever, and Ubisoft decided to push the whole Jade's Game angle, it's why the

21:05.740 --> 21:08.420
comic of her sucking off all the nerds went viral.

21:08.420 --> 21:13.500
Yes, clearly, women can provide more than their looks to the gaming space, but none

21:13.500 --> 21:17.900
of these women did, and our memories are too long for you to be able to rewrite history.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.740
And I wish I could turn the camera around so that you could see the incredible team

21:21.740 --> 21:23.300
that make X-Play.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.700
Half of our producers and writers are women.

21:25.700 --> 21:30.100
Emily, Abby, Megan, Joe, Jake, Zipper, Gabby.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.620
None of these people will be receiving a paycheck by 2023, and part of it will be because your

21:33.620 --> 21:37.420
content isn't getting any traction, but most of it will be because of the backlash that

21:37.420 --> 21:41.340
they're creating right now by attacking the only people who could ever possibly be interested

21:41.340 --> 21:42.340
in watching you.

21:42.340 --> 21:46.620
When you're in our DMs or on those YouTube comments or in Twitch chat right now, those

21:46.620 --> 21:50.860
reactionary threads thinking that I'm somehow ruining your current X-Play experience because

21:50.860 --> 21:55.980
you can't objectify me, how you previously did to Morgan, or that I'm somehow less qualified

21:55.980 --> 22:00.300
to speak on something, but you can't quite put your finger on why, even though I'm reading

22:00.300 --> 22:04.920
the exact same script as Adam, but you have no problem with his part of it, you're letting

22:04.920 --> 22:09.040
your unconscious biases ruin my day and you're gatekeeping the gaming space.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
No.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.040
Gatekeeping is good.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.560
I'm actually not doubting you're a gamer, I'm just doubting that you're a gamer I want

22:13.560 --> 22:14.560
to listen to.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.960
Like I said in the last video, you can't actually be gatekept from games.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.240
But now that you're screaming that banter, that the camaraderie of everybody getting

22:21.240 --> 22:25.220
their turn of being the butt of the joke, that the ethics of irreverence should not

22:25.220 --> 22:30.200
apply to you because you have a vagina, that is, in fact, gatekeeping on your part.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.400
If you don't like it, don't watch it.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.400
Peace!

22:33.400 --> 22:36.920
You know what?

22:36.920 --> 22:37.920
Sounds good to me.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.800
Also, look at her face after the camera's off her.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
Holy shit.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.640
That chat she's watching must be lacing into her for her stupidity.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.560
She can't take it that nobody agrees with her, and that she's just very well made of

22:46.560 --> 22:48.680
tanked her own fucking show due to her ego.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.600
Also, look at Gerard over there, he's sitting like he's taking a shit into his chair.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.120
Another Gerard of ten years ago is not a woke-schooled like he is now.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.920
I wonder if that younger, slimmer Gerard is still inside the fat one, looking out at the

22:57.920 --> 23:01.600
modern world but unable to affect it, watching horrifically as his body is puppeted for these

23:01.600 --> 23:02.600
dark purposes.

23:02.800 --> 23:06.360
I began the previous video, that one about gatekeeping, with my own background because

23:06.360 --> 23:08.600
I wanted to make it known that I'm invested in the topic.

23:08.600 --> 23:12.560
My friend Arch, the king of gatekeeping videos, said on stream later that he didn't quite

23:12.560 --> 23:15.240
get it, that to him it sounded like I was complaining about being bullied.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.600
And fair enough, I don't actually think I brought it all together in the end like I

23:18.600 --> 23:19.600
wanted to.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.240
The point I was making was, in order for you to truly care about some hobby, some subculture,

23:23.240 --> 23:26.320
some community, you have to have that level of attachment to it.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.360
I'm not gonna sit here and say it was like I got abused or something, but yeah, you gotta

23:29.360 --> 23:31.720
suffer at least a little bit to truly enjoy something, you know?

23:31.840 --> 23:33.960
You gotta take your lumps to be accepted into the group.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.420
But this?

23:35.420 --> 23:39.780
This is a woman who's clearly suffering, sure, but she's not taking her lumps, so she's not

23:39.780 --> 23:41.280
being accepted into the group.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.680
She's complaining about the lumps, and then complaining further about the rejection.

23:44.680 --> 23:49.400
It sounds strange to say it, but intuitively this phrase feels right.

23:49.400 --> 23:53.080
On some levels she's not a real gamer, no zoomer can be, the way that we are, because

23:53.080 --> 23:54.800
they never got ostracized like we did.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.640
However, does that mean that ostracization is required to be a gamer?

23:58.640 --> 24:01.200
No, I don't think so.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.820
Maybe it's that she completely lacks respect for people who were ostracized.

24:04.820 --> 24:09.200
She got in on a free pass, and then complained about, and then later prolonged, the suffering

24:09.200 --> 24:10.560
of those who came before.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.840
Yeah, that's what it is.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.740
It's not that she's not a real gamer, it's that she has no respect for gamers who are

24:15.740 --> 24:16.740
not like her.

24:16.740 --> 24:20.240
Again, I'm not talking like this is some kind of racial oppression level of suffering, that's

24:20.240 --> 24:21.440
just stupid.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.640
But we did get teased for being gamers, and we grew from it.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.640
She didn't.

24:25.640 --> 24:29.580
And now that she is being teased, she's sulking with the children that we were.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.180
This new G4 isn't going to last.

24:31.180 --> 24:34.380
Watch their social blade over the next few months, after the spotlight moves on from

24:34.380 --> 24:35.380
them.

24:35.380 --> 24:38.900
We're already seeing the immediate loss of subs due to backlash, but after that levels

24:38.900 --> 24:42.580
out, I do also expect a slow abandonment of their audience and gradual decrease of views

24:42.580 --> 24:43.580
over time.

24:43.580 --> 24:46.840
The general gaming public does not give a shit about G4 anymore, they've long since

24:46.840 --> 24:48.880
been replaced by twitch streamers and youtubers.

24:48.880 --> 24:53.260
The only people who are watching G4 now, are people who had fond memories of G4 from back

24:53.260 --> 24:57.420
then, and you just told them that they're shit, the show they loved is shit.

24:57.420 --> 25:01.620
The ethics of irreverence that made the show what it was, are shit, and how they all need

25:01.620 --> 25:03.780
to grow up and get with the demoralization.

25:03.780 --> 25:07.020
You will not last, and the internet will be better when you're gone.

25:07.020 --> 25:11.380
I'm not even somebody who watched G4, but I'm willing to bet that, after viewing this

25:11.380 --> 25:16.500
shit show, old school fans are now nostalgic for that dark era during G4's decline, where

25:16.500 --> 25:21.620
all they played were back to back reruns of Campus PD and Star Trek The Next Generation.

25:22.620 --> 25:23.120
Women.

25:23.120 --> 25:23.820
Sexism.

25:23.820 --> 25:24.320
Women.

25:24.320 --> 25:24.820
Women.

25:24.820 --> 25:25.320
Bangable.

25:25.320 --> 25:25.820
Sexist.

25:25.820 --> 25:26.620
Sexism.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.120
Woman.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.420
Jerked off to women.

25:28.420 --> 25:28.920
Women.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.920
If you don't like it, don't watch it.
