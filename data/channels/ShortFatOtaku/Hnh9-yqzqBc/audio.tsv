0	16160	The problem they have always had with us is irreverence.
16160	19200	Irreverence is the act of making a joke about something that is normally considered to be
19200	20200	serious.
20200	24080	Being irreverent means you're not showing respect for something that is generally respected.
24080	26200	Adults like to use this term as a pejorative.
26200	31840	How dare these kids today not take school or work or the church or the government seriously?
31840	34540	The trend of kids being irreverent isn't exactly new.
34540	38440	As much as tradcons like to pretend that rebellion against the traditional order began its slow
38440	42640	march only in the post-war era, Socrates is known to have famously said,
42640	44660	The children now love luxury.
44660	47100	They have bad manners, contempt for authority.
47100	50820	They show disrespect for elders and love chatter in the place of exercise.
50820	53480	Children are now tyrants, not the servant of households.
53480	55640	They no longer rise when elders enter the room.
55640	59920	They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table,
59920	62720	cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.
62720	66860	This trend may differ depending on the time period, the culture, the wealth or poverty
66860	71120	of the society in which they live, but I think it's safe to say that the trend is real.
71120	73880	It is in the nature of a child to be irreverent.
73880	77840	I can already hear Sargon's voice echoing in my head, not my kids Dev.
77840	81580	Well, your kids are still in that phase where everything revolves around the parents.
81580	85520	When he's 12 and in the privacy of his friends, I'm sure he will say things about you that
85520	87320	you'd never think he was capable of.
87320	92000	And that's okay, because you did it in the privacy of your friends when you were 12 too.
92000	97040	Every kid says, even if they don't truly mean it, my dad is a hard ass or my mom sucks,
97040	98640	as long as they know they're not going to be caught.
98640	101860	It doesn't mean that your kids hate you, it just means that they're growing into a more
101860	105160	independent phase of life, and they're figuring out its boundaries.
105160	109220	An attitude of irreverence is the discovery mechanism of this process.
109220	110960	When you're a child, you're given rules.
110960	115480	They're not only there to keep you safe, but to, broadly speaking, let you know what
115480	117360	is good and evil in the world.
117360	121380	The teen years, however, are when you test the rules, so that you may discover for yourself
121380	123680	why something is good or evil.
123680	127480	And sometimes, though rarely, you might discover that a rule is legitimately outdated, that
127480	131280	what it guards against is no longer relevant, that the outside world has changed.
131280	136080	For example, it made sense not to eat pork and shellfish in an era of foodborne parasites
136080	139880	and diseases, but in practical terms, that's a problem we've largely figured out nowadays.
139880	143640	I am going to stress, though, testing the rules and discovering they need changing is
143640	146580	a lot less common than most teenagers think.
146580	151560	The 90s and 2000s was an era where irreverence was really considered a positive quality.
151560	156160	Yes, you had the anti-war, free-love, commune-dwelling hippies of the 60s and 70s.
156160	160080	They were certainly irreverent, and garnered their fair share of scorn from the previous
160080	161080	generation.
161080	165440	But appreciation for those values and aesthetics that made those decades only came about after
165440	166720	their time had passed.
166720	173360	To contrast, the 90s and 2000s knew exactly what they were, while they were, and it was
173360	174360	irreverent.
174360	178800	The trend certainly got its start in the late 80s, where popular culture began to push child
178800	183560	and teenage protagonists who genuinely did not give a flip about normal responsibilities,
183560	189600	instead opting for hijinks and adventures.
189600	193840	But it was the 90s where everything became that, and every kid wanted to be that.
193840	195760	Who didn't want to be a teenage superhero?
195800	199720	School seemed like an institutionalized joke designed to rob us of our youth, and adulthood
199720	201760	seemed like a gap that we would never be able to bridge.
201760	205320	Of course, everyone bridges it eventually, and as I mentioned in a previous video, if
205320	209800	people's politics change over time, they're more likely to drift more rightward than anything
209800	210800	else.
210800	213260	However, this doesn't happen exactly the same way all the time.
213260	217600	When the conservatism of age begins to bloom, it grows out of the compost of the values
217600	219060	held in youth.
219060	222840	Those hippies eventually became my generation's parents, the dreaded boomers.
222840	226800	And sometimes it's hard for me to square away in my head that today's older Karens were
226800	229260	the same people putting flowers into rifle barrels.
229260	234040	While the hippies certainly had their socialist positions, they were also staunch individualists
234040	236460	in their rejection of the traditional religious collective order.
236460	240880	The GI generation enjoyed the Roaring Twenties, suffered during the Great Depression, and
240880	244900	then fought in World War II, running the gamut from progressive overindulgence to societal
244900	246880	collapse to conservative responsibility.
246880	251200	Meanwhile, my generation, the Millennials, largely rejected the neo-conservatism typical
251200	252200	of the 90s.
252200	255800	From the religious like Pat Robertson, to the censorious like Jack Thompson, to the
255800	259600	corporatist like George Bush, to the insane like Jack Chick.
259600	264040	And as Millennials are aging now, they are expressing their own form of conservatism.
264040	268040	And if the exploration that characterized their youth was steeped in the worship of
268040	273440	youth's own irreverent quality, their conservatism seems to be the complete rejection of irreverence.
273440	278880	Call me a killjoy, but I think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should
278880	280300	be able to enjoy it.
280300	283880	The 90s is known for the creation of three unique types of irreverence.
283880	289180	The first is gross-out humor, snot and shit, farts and burps, throwing up and weird foods
289180	291700	and all manner of tie-dyed mystery slime.
291700	293900	This was the humor of the young millennial kid.
293900	297780	Meanwhile, kids who were a bit older may have had the opportunity to enjoy the second type
297780	301620	of irreverence, which was less visceral, the sarcastic comedy.
301620	306540	Consider The Simpsons, South Park, or a bit later on, Family Guy episodes of the era.
306540	307780	Every joke was allowed.
307780	309700	Every topic could be made fun of.
309700	313580	Every curse word and slur was uttered, even if only past the watershed.
313580	317060	Yeah, some of them were bleeped, but we knew what they were saying.
317060	321640	And beyond just cartoons and comedies, do you think this scene in Die Hard 3 could be
321640	322640	made now?
322640	326500	Certainly not, but I don't recall people saying it was racist back then.
326500	329220	In fact, the point of it is that McClain isn't racist.
329220	332420	He's forced into this situation under threat of a bomb going off.
332420	336600	And the point of the scene, for our purposes outside the movie, is that the 90s had a blanket
336600	338780	default assumption of non-racism.
338780	342740	And he's breaking that assumption openly and explicitly against his will.
342740	345100	And so, we laugh at the situation.
345100	348580	People weren't really screeching and demanding inclusivity and diversity and all the other
348580	350540	buzzwords we hear today back then.
350540	353340	General goodwill among your common citizen was assumed.
353340	355820	The Griller meme was the reality of this era.
355820	359420	Yes, there were still racists, but they were reviled for their stupidity.
359420	364420	And when we noticed them, we called them racists, and others actually understood what that meant.
364420	368560	Because we didn't just throw around that term wantonly, using it to describe anybody
368560	371960	and everybody who disagreed with our views, diluting it to the point that it was no longer
371960	372960	useful.
372960	373960	Thanks for that, Progs.
373960	377040	While The Simpsons has turned into a shambling corpse that should have been cancelled 20
377040	380720	seasons ago, and Family Guy is now run by people openly admitting that the old episodes
380720	385040	are so edgy that they're ashamed of them, South Park continues to be irreverent, even
385040	389120	though the era of 90s irreverence has been replaced by the progressive puritanism of
389120	390120	the current year.
390120	393600	Soccer moms back then were screaming that South Park was turning their kids into little
393600	397920	sociopaths, with those irreverent depictions of Jesus and Satan, and how Saddam Hussein
397920	401320	was hanging around in hell, and how Kenny violently died every episode.
401320	405200	Woke's Golds now are screaming that South Park's continued irreverence, but now towards
405200	410000	modern views of transgenderism and social justice, mirrors that old outrage.
410000	414200	It's kinda like how conservative Christians burned Harry Potter books before, and leftoids
414200	415280	burned them now.
415280	419920	These are both ultimately puritanical reactions to the liberal values of free speech, just
419920	421720	coming from the left instead of the right.
421720	423600	And this is where we get to the core of the matter.
423600	428720	Equality before the law, consent of the governed, freedom to speak and to choose and to think,
428720	431960	these things require a certain degree of irreverence.
431960	435840	We must be able to make fun of public figures and speak controversial things for a liberal
435840	437240	society to function.
437240	440920	Irreverence is not only the culture of the 90s, or the method by which the youth define
440920	445520	themselves, it is also one of the mechanisms by which a free society is actually free.
445520	449840	Which is why the Woke's Gold millennials of today, in reacting against irreverence,
449840	452880	also ultimately end up reacting against freedom itself.
453040	456800	South Park was where I first figured out this connection between the Woke's Gold's aging
456800	457800	and neo-puritanism.
457800	459200	I'm a millennial myself.
459200	463040	I am also aging, you zoomers, but I still enjoy irreverent humor, which is probably
463040	466520	the reason why most S.A.W.s my age think I'm childish.
466520	469440	And sure, I'm always going to be a kid at heart, I think that's even healthy on some
469440	471800	level to retain youthful energy and optimism.
471800	474520	But you know, I actually have grown up where it counts.
474520	479840	I'm just still an irreverent person because it's a better, more free way to be.
479840	485240	But the people who rebel against irreverence, almost always shed out takes like this, eventually.
485240	489280	Everyone recognizes that Gamergate was a practice run for the resurgence of fascism,
489280	492680	but we don't talk enough about how there's a straight line from South Park to the kind
492680	496840	of online white nationalist humor that gradually became not a joke at all.
496840	500480	When I was a kid, the notion that everyone who was ever offended by anything was an idiot
500480	504760	had common currency, and fortunately all my friends eventually realized that was wrong,
504760	508160	but a lot of people didn't and those people are now Nazis.
508160	509520	You can see it, can't you?
509520	513200	Now that you've heard me ramble about the 90s and irreverence for a while, can you see
513200	515140	what I see in this passage?
515140	519400	This person is reacting against the pop culture of their youth, and decrying others who haven't,
519400	521640	in their view, grown up.
521640	526720	Even though the 90s were culturally, literally so close to the liberal idea of fairness and
526720	531460	freedom that abandoning irreverence means regressing back towards Puritanism.
531460	535400	Their only option to salvage this garbage position is to say that the irreverence didn't
535400	540560	belie a generalized rebellious attitude towards authority, but instead a latent fascism, since
540560	544640	to be irreverent to the current progressive modern culture cannot be framed in any other
544640	548000	way if they want to maintain a semblance of a moral high ground.
548000	552680	Just as D&D players had to be Satan worshippers and gamers had to be school shooters, people
552680	555520	who like edgy jokes have to be Nazis.
555520	557780	It's all out of the Puritans handbook.
557780	563120	In retrospect, it seems impossible to overstate the cultural damage done by South Park, the
563120	567600	show that portrayed earnestness as the only sin, and taught that mockery is the ultimate
567600	569600	inoculation against all criticism.
569600	572100	You have, once again, missed the point.
572100	576020	What South Park teaches is that everything can be mocked, and that it should be.
576020	578200	There should be no sacred cows.
578200	579200	Everyone gets their turn.
579200	583320	It's a shame Ed Sheeran didn't figure it out, but don't worry, I'm sure he got
583320	586160	over his life being ruined with his millions of dollars.
586160	590180	That third type of 90s irreverence that I skipped over earlier, alongside gross out
590180	595020	humor and sarcastic comedy, is probably best described as extreme slapstick.
595020	599780	From prank shows like Punk'd, to stunt and injury shows like MXC, this type of media
599780	604260	was a mixture of real, caught-on-camera style footage with the choreographed stunts of a
604260	605260	traditional movie.
605260	607740	In other words, you were watching action, but it was real.
607740	610860	Skateboard crashes where people really lose a tooth or break a leg.
610860	614180	Actual fights and arguments generally accompanied by a live-league logo in the corner.
614180	616700	Real pranks and trolls on unsuspecting people.
616700	619660	What links all of these things together is authenticity.
619660	624100	Jackass is considered the pinnacle of irreverent culture, as it combined all three types.
624100	627860	Gross out, sarcastic comedy, and extreme slapstick, all in one movie.
627860	631080	I'm actually really surprised that a fourth Jackass movie is on the way, because just
631080	634420	as soccer moms back then said it was inappropriate, what was goals today are probably calling
634420	635420	it problematic.
635420	639340	Within the past year or so, I've recently re-watched all three Jackass movies with friends,
639340	642500	and all I could think throughout them was, there's no way this would get made today.
642500	645180	Everything's gotten so much more repressive since the old days.
645180	646180	MXC, same thing.
646340	649500	There's actually a Twitch channel where all the episodes of MXC are aired on repeat.
649500	652900	And I'm surprised it's still up, because every time I tune in over there, there's
652900	655500	immediately a joke that would never fly on the internet today.
655500	657620	I guess Twitch just hasn't realized it yet.
657620	662820	Uh, we've had reports that one of our prisoners is missing, but don't worry, Guy is on orange
662820	667380	alert and nothing will get by me, Guy, huh?
667380	670380	Hey baby doll.
670380	673140	Ha ha ha ha, Guy likes.
673140	674820	There's a million other examples as well.
674820	678300	Spike advertisements for video games that are overtly sexual are disgusting by today's
678300	680580	woke standards, but they were just normal back then.
680580	682060	Edge sold, simple as that.
682060	685860	And even as the edgy era began to fall out of touch, game companies continued to use
685860	689660	those same tactics, right up until it got them canceled by the game journals of the
689660	690660	day.
690660	695140	Spike TV, the well-known Network for Men that pioneered MXC, also aired many similar
695140	698740	types of shows, stuff that was steeped in all sorts of irreverence.
698740	703140	The early internet also mirrored this attitude, from 4chan to YTMND to Newgrounds.
703140	706700	With eBOMB's world stealing at all, it was all edgy content.
706700	711580	Even though Urban Dictionary is heavily woke-ified nowadays, it was a bastion of Edge 20 years
711580	712580	ago.
712580	716300	And occasionally, some Prague will find an old entry and kick up a big stink on Twitter
716300	721620	about how people used to use the slang, gay fart, to describe a fart that smelled of cum.
721620	725100	As the internet's earliest content creators got off the ground in the mid to late 2000s,
725100	728060	the reverence culture was still in full swing, and it showed.
728060	730940	Tourette's Guy is amazingly, hilariously offensive.
730940	734180	It's the guy who does skits, acting like the worst possible stereotype of somebody
734180	735180	with threats.
735180	737620	This is the kind of stuff that went viral back in 2006.
737620	742380	Angry Video Game Nerd also got his start in this era, and is also a show based in a reverence
742380	746900	culture, incessantly screaming curse words about old Nintendo games, and even real-life
746900	751260	prank calling a hardware store and reviewing Atari porn games in early episodes.
751260	753560	James Rolfe would never do that shit nowadays.
753560	756040	And I personally have extremely vivid memories.
756040	758140	It's been totally scrubbed off the internet by now, I'm sure.
758140	759720	I have a Doug Walker video.
759720	760720	That guy with the glasses.
760720	761720	Channel Awesome.
761720	764760	Five second movie review of Batman and Robin.
764760	769760	And all it is, is a video of his ass hovering over a toilet while a shit log falls out of
769760	770760	it.
770760	771760	Wait, wait, wait.
771760	772760	This is the dev of the future, while editing the video.
772760	775600	I found it on the internet archive, and it's just how I remember it.
775600	778900	I'm not going to put it in the video, I don't want to get banned, but it's in the description.
778900	781320	And holy shit, literally.
781320	785400	The ethics of irreverence really does boil down to, everybody gets a shot.
785400	787540	Every skater kid gets to try the jump.
787540	790120	Everyone gets laughed at when they fail, praised when they succeed.
790120	793260	And given their due for taking a shot regardless of outcome.
793260	795080	Everybody gets pranked, and everybody laughs.
795080	798480	Knowing full well that tomorrow, they will be pranked by today's victim, and laughed
798480	799480	at.
799480	802840	Everybody gets a slur thrown their way, knowing that it's all in jest.
802840	805700	Understanding that differences exist, but not letting them divide or define.
805700	808720	A logical good fit with this ethic is the gamer space.
808720	812280	A community that's competitive and rowdy by its very nature, but ultimately inclusive
812280	813620	as long as you can game.
813620	817120	You can smack talk somebody's race or gender, but in the end, the leaderboard doesn't
817120	818120	lie.
818120	821640	The game unfolds, and rejecting the ethics of irreverence, reject the fairness, the humor,
821640	823260	the camaraderie, and the competition.
823260	827740	Where gamergate began as a gamers are dead styled rejection of gamers, by the anti-gamers
827740	832080	who wheeled their way into power within the gaming space, what gamergate actually was,
832080	835580	underneath all the accusations of sexism, underneath the culture war, was the first
835580	837820	real push of the rejection of irreverence.
837820	841640	And this has finally been directly said, laid out for all to see, eight years later.
841640	843380	Here's a Facebook comment that went viral.
843380	846660	It boggles my fucking mind how we lost gamers to the right.
846660	848900	Feminism is the biggest cause of the decline of gaming.
848900	853220	Microtransactions, loot crates, pay to win, selling games piecemeal, charging full price
853220	856840	for garbage that'll get fixed later, relying on modders, monopolistic growth relying on
856840	858160	removing competition.
858160	862720	Gaming is a microcosm of the failures of capitalism, and all gamers think is, look how feminism
862720	864520	diversity is ruining my video games.
864520	867360	This is actually a somewhat reasonable critique of some of the problems with gaming right
867360	870760	now, but the even more viral reply to this post is jaw dropping.
870760	874720	I'm not going to read it all, it's like a 100 tweet thread, but the full thing is
874720	878460	in the description and worth seeing in detail to understand the brains of these people.
878460	881260	When was the last time you saw a left wing gaming clan?
881260	884860	The reactionary politics is baked into the mechanics, and they're exposed to it at
884860	888740	increasingly younger ages, where their primary social contact is with people who get them
888740	890940	to enforce hierarchies of competition.
890940	893540	Competitive games are designed to attract people who like conquering.
893540	898840	Why do you think 4X games are so prone to fanbases who are viscerally reactionary gamers?
898840	903120	It's in the genre definition, 4X is a colonialism power fantasy, they're on the front lines
903120	904720	of the excess of capitalism.
904720	908760	The only message they receive is, when my guy was in, things were fine, now I have to
908760	910340	be the guy or make the guy.
910340	914180	They need a despot to rule them and tell them what to do, because their entire social hierarchy
914180	915180	depends on it.
915180	919440	If leftists want to convert gamers to leftist politics, they have to do on the ground advocacy
919440	923460	in an engaging way via clans, esport teams, and larger communities.
923460	927500	However, that will always struggle against the fundamental mechanics of these games that
927500	929540	select for this behaviour.
929540	933840	With the lens of, Wokesgold's reject the irreverence of childhood and the ethics behind
933840	937400	it in mind, go back and listen to that passage again.
937400	939720	Do you see what she's saying?
939720	943480	Competition itself is problematic, because the type of person that is competitive rejects
943480	947720	the mass equality of socialism and prefers to climb hierarchies of merit, and because
947720	952500	games are about challenges to overcome, enemies to vanquish, lands to conquer, princesses
952500	957540	to save, puzzles to solve, they will always be challenging, they will always be hierarchical,
957540	959380	and they will always be problematic.
959380	964180	Hammergate was always about a hatred of games, the hatred of gamers was icing on the cake
964180	965240	to these people.
965240	969000	As for why hate games, I can only speculate, but I've had to guess.
969000	973800	It would be that a well-adjusted adult is somebody who, as a child, engaged in play
973800	977280	both solo and with others, and was socialized by that play.
977280	981440	If you want to create damaged, subverted, and undisciplined adults, you must subvert
981440	982440	their play.
982440	986160	Subverting games is one very popular vector to do this with, but they're using Gramsci's
986160	988700	playbook everywhere with the same goal.
988720	993120	Creating irreverence, how it was the youth culture 20 years ago, how it's being rebelled
993120	997800	against now, and why they're rebelling, explains every single Prague movement and talking
997800	1002760	point since before gamergate, and the reason I've decided to do this video now is because
1002760	1004440	of the recent G4 debacle.
1004440	1009160	G4 launched in 2002 with the express purpose of competing with tech TV, but with programming
1009160	1014260	aimed at MTV's demographics, teens and young adults, and like MTV, it was inundated with
1014260	1015480	irreverence culture.
1015500	1018820	And while its programming revolved around video games, computers, and technology, its
1018820	1023940	tone and style stuck to the skits, pranks, rude jokes, and sex appeal that was popular
1023940	1024940	at the time.
1024940	1028020	By 2006, the channel had to broaden its focus to attract viewers.
1028020	1033260	By 2009, the channel was experiencing significant cutbacks and layoffs, and by 2014, the network
1033260	1037420	completely closed, having been entirely replaced by YouTubers and streamers online.
1037420	1042300	But nonetheless, G4 is remembered fondly by its fans, with its flagship show, Attack of
1042300	1044980	the Show, still adored by gamers.
1044980	1049120	G4 relaunched on YouTube last year, and their channel is dead, it's a graveyard.
1049120	1052120	They've got half a million subs, and they get the same views that I do.
1052120	1055720	Meanwhile, they've got 20 people on staff to pay for it all, plus all their very expensive
1055720	1056720	looking sets.
1056720	1058900	I can't imagine this thing is making any money.
1058900	1063160	So when your failing revival of an already failed brand is failing to compete against
1063160	1067160	the people who replaced you a decade ago, is about to sink again, what is your business
1067160	1068160	strategy?
1068160	1070440	Is it to blame the people who should have been your viewers, the people who remember
1070440	1072560	G4 as a part of their childhood or teen years?
1072560	1076700	Would you be surprised if the answer to that question is a resounding yes?
1076700	1081820	But I actually want to talk about something so much more important than Red Dead Online.
1081820	1083380	Sexism in gaming.
1083380	1097900	In joining G4, this is a conversation we've been having since a full fucking decade ago,
1097900	1102440	where Zoe Quinn cheated on Aaron Joni, with two full Greyhound buses worth of people.
1102440	1106640	And the conversation always goes like this, you suck, your show sucks, and that's why
1106640	1107640	you get vitriol.
1107640	1108640	That's it.
1108640	1114160	Every time G4 is brought up in various channels, even in this YouTube channel, we have the
1114160	1119500	chat in front of us, I can see you, without a doubt, there will be backlash, because I'm
1119500	1122160	not as bangable as the previous hosts.
1122160	1123160	It's somehow-
1123160	1124680	Talk to him, Frost!
1124680	1129580	It has somehow been expected that you can talk about how much you jerked off to women
1129580	1130580	as a compliment.
1130580	1131580	It's not a compliment!
1131580	1132580	It's weird!
1132580	1136320	I'm going to go ahead and be the contrarian once again, and say, you know what, disregarding
1136320	1139240	her personality of course, that's a pretty big thing to disregard, this girl is actually
1139240	1140820	kind of cute in her own way.
1140820	1144760	The blonde, short haired petite girl is certainly a type, it's why so many people were fapping
1144760	1147660	it to Kes on Voyager or that psychic chick from Judge Dredd.
1147660	1151460	Suicide Girls was full of tatted up short haired blondes, and this look was for a time
1151460	1154420	incredibly popular, though maybe this is just me showing my age because the appeal
1154420	1157140	of Suicide Girls was downstream from a reverence culture.
1157140	1161040	Um, for you zoomers out there, Suicide Girls was basically a porn site that exclusively
1161040	1164800	catered to alt girls with tattoos, piercings, and punk hairstyles.
1164800	1169500	In an era before video streaming, your choices were buying porn DVDs or porn off satellite
1169500	1174680	TV, downloading porn videos from Kazaa or Limewire, or looking at pictures, and the
1174680	1177520	only place that was doing alt girls was Suicide Girls.
1177520	1181220	And fun fact, that's where Zoe Quinn posted her nudes back in the day too.
1181260	1184900	The point is though, I know very well the aesthetic she's appealing to, and she does
1184900	1187380	look like she could have made a few bucks in that site back in the day.
1187380	1188820	Give yourself a bit more credit, girl.
1188820	1194340	Women do not exist to be nice on the eyes for you, Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not
1194340	1197180	exist to be nice on the eyes for you.
1197180	1202340	Oh no, oh no, roll the clips.
1202340	1203740	Sexism in gaming.
1203740	1204940	Here we go again.
1204940	1210060	Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not exist to be nice on the eyes for you.
1210100	1211100	Oh crap.
1212540	1213540	Just roll it.
1230780	1234980	Sexism objectifies women, hates women, sexist, sexism woman.
1234980	1237660	Half of our producers and writers are women.
1237660	1238660	Okay, first of all Kevin.
1238780	1241540	This is not a regulation dog, so you're a raw dog in here.
1241540	1242780	It's really thick.
1242780	1246620	What makes this funny as shit is that this is exactly why these women existed.
1246620	1250620	It's why when Olivia Munn made the jump to the Daily Show, she lasted for a few skits
1250620	1253940	before disappearing, and nobody even noticing she was there.
1253940	1257220	It's why Morgan Webb hasn't done a single thing of note since G4 died.
1257220	1260980	Hell, I know this ain't G4, but back when the first Assassin's Creed dropped in like
1260980	1265740	2006 or whatever, and Ubisoft decided to push the whole Jade's Game angle, it's why the
1265740	1268420	comic of her sucking off all the nerds went viral.
1268420	1273500	Yes, clearly, women can provide more than their looks to the gaming space, but none
1273500	1277900	of these women did, and our memories are too long for you to be able to rewrite history.
1277900	1281740	And I wish I could turn the camera around so that you could see the incredible team
1281740	1283300	that make X-Play.
1283300	1285700	Half of our producers and writers are women.
1285700	1290100	Emily, Abby, Megan, Joe, Jake, Zipper, Gabby.
1290100	1293620	None of these people will be receiving a paycheck by 2023, and part of it will be because your
1293620	1297420	content isn't getting any traction, but most of it will be because of the backlash that
1297420	1301340	they're creating right now by attacking the only people who could ever possibly be interested
1301340	1302340	in watching you.
1302340	1306620	When you're in our DMs or on those YouTube comments or in Twitch chat right now, those
1306620	1310860	reactionary threads thinking that I'm somehow ruining your current X-Play experience because
1310860	1315980	you can't objectify me, how you previously did to Morgan, or that I'm somehow less qualified
1315980	1320300	to speak on something, but you can't quite put your finger on why, even though I'm reading
1320300	1324920	the exact same script as Adam, but you have no problem with his part of it, you're letting
1324920	1329040	your unconscious biases ruin my day and you're gatekeeping the gaming space.
1329040	1330040	No.
1330040	1331040	Gatekeeping is good.
1331040	1333560	I'm actually not doubting you're a gamer, I'm just doubting that you're a gamer I want
1333560	1334560	to listen to.
1334560	1337960	Like I said in the last video, you can't actually be gatekept from games.
1337960	1341240	But now that you're screaming that banter, that the camaraderie of everybody getting
1341240	1345220	their turn of being the butt of the joke, that the ethics of irreverence should not
1345220	1350200	apply to you because you have a vagina, that is, in fact, gatekeeping on your part.
1350200	1352400	If you don't like it, don't watch it.
1352400	1353400	Peace!
1353400	1356920	You know what?
1356920	1357920	Sounds good to me.
1357920	1359800	Also, look at her face after the camera's off her.
1359800	1360800	Holy shit.
1360800	1363640	That chat she's watching must be lacing into her for her stupidity.
1363640	1366560	She can't take it that nobody agrees with her, and that she's just very well made of
1366560	1368680	tanked her own fucking show due to her ego.
1368680	1371600	Also, look at Gerard over there, he's sitting like he's taking a shit into his chair.
1371600	1374120	Another Gerard of ten years ago is not a woke-schooled like he is now.
1374120	1377920	I wonder if that younger, slimmer Gerard is still inside the fat one, looking out at the
1377920	1381600	modern world but unable to affect it, watching horrifically as his body is puppeted for these
1381600	1382600	dark purposes.
1382800	1386360	I began the previous video, that one about gatekeeping, with my own background because
1386360	1388600	I wanted to make it known that I'm invested in the topic.
1388600	1392560	My friend Arch, the king of gatekeeping videos, said on stream later that he didn't quite
1392560	1395240	get it, that to him it sounded like I was complaining about being bullied.
1395240	1398600	And fair enough, I don't actually think I brought it all together in the end like I
1398600	1399600	wanted to.
1399600	1403240	The point I was making was, in order for you to truly care about some hobby, some subculture,
1403240	1406320	some community, you have to have that level of attachment to it.
1406320	1409360	I'm not gonna sit here and say it was like I got abused or something, but yeah, you gotta
1409360	1411720	suffer at least a little bit to truly enjoy something, you know?
1411840	1413960	You gotta take your lumps to be accepted into the group.
1413960	1415420	But this?
1415420	1419780	This is a woman who's clearly suffering, sure, but she's not taking her lumps, so she's not
1419780	1421280	being accepted into the group.
1421280	1424680	She's complaining about the lumps, and then complaining further about the rejection.
1424680	1429400	It sounds strange to say it, but intuitively this phrase feels right.
1429400	1433080	On some levels she's not a real gamer, no zoomer can be, the way that we are, because
1433080	1434800	they never got ostracized like we did.
1434800	1438640	However, does that mean that ostracization is required to be a gamer?
1438640	1441200	No, I don't think so.
1441200	1444820	Maybe it's that she completely lacks respect for people who were ostracized.
1444820	1449200	She got in on a free pass, and then complained about, and then later prolonged, the suffering
1449200	1450560	of those who came before.
1450560	1452840	Yeah, that's what it is.
1452840	1455740	It's not that she's not a real gamer, it's that she has no respect for gamers who are
1455740	1456740	not like her.
1456740	1460240	Again, I'm not talking like this is some kind of racial oppression level of suffering, that's
1460240	1461440	just stupid.
1461440	1464640	But we did get teased for being gamers, and we grew from it.
1464640	1465640	She didn't.
1465640	1469580	And now that she is being teased, she's sulking with the children that we were.
1469580	1471180	This new G4 isn't going to last.
1471180	1474380	Watch their social blade over the next few months, after the spotlight moves on from
1474380	1475380	them.
1475380	1478900	We're already seeing the immediate loss of subs due to backlash, but after that levels
1478900	1482580	out, I do also expect a slow abandonment of their audience and gradual decrease of views
1482580	1483580	over time.
1483580	1486840	The general gaming public does not give a shit about G4 anymore, they've long since
1486840	1488880	been replaced by twitch streamers and youtubers.
1488880	1493260	The only people who are watching G4 now, are people who had fond memories of G4 from back
1493260	1497420	then, and you just told them that they're shit, the show they loved is shit.
1497420	1501620	The ethics of irreverence that made the show what it was, are shit, and how they all need
1501620	1503780	to grow up and get with the demoralization.
1503780	1507020	You will not last, and the internet will be better when you're gone.
1507020	1511380	I'm not even somebody who watched G4, but I'm willing to bet that, after viewing this
1511380	1516500	shit show, old school fans are now nostalgic for that dark era during G4's decline, where
1516500	1521620	all they played were back to back reruns of Campus PD and Star Trek The Next Generation.
1522620	1523120	Women.
1523120	1523820	Sexism.
1523820	1524320	Women.
1524320	1524820	Women.
1524820	1525320	Bangable.
1525320	1525820	Sexist.
1525820	1526620	Sexism.
1526620	1527120	Woman.
1527120	1528420	Jerked off to women.
1528420	1528920	Women.
1528920	1530920	If you don't like it, don't watch it.
