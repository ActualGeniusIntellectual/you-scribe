1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,160
The problem they have always had with us is irreverence.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,200
Irreverence is the act of making a joke about something that is normally considered to be

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
serious.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,080
Being irreverent means you're not showing respect for something that is generally respected.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,200
Adults like to use this term as a pejorative.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,840
How dare these kids today not take school or work or the church or the government seriously?

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,540
The trend of kids being irreverent isn't exactly new.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,440
As much as tradcons like to pretend that rebellion against the traditional order began its slow

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,640
march only in the post-war era, Socrates is known to have famously said,

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,660
The children now love luxury.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,100
They have bad manners, contempt for authority.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,820
They show disrespect for elders and love chatter in the place of exercise.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,480
Children are now tyrants, not the servant of households.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,640
They no longer rise when elders enter the room.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,920
They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table,

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,720
cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,860
This trend may differ depending on the time period, the culture, the wealth or poverty

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,120
of the society in which they live, but I think it's safe to say that the trend is real.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,880
It is in the nature of a child to be irreverent.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,840
I can already hear Sargon's voice echoing in my head, not my kids Dev.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,580
Well, your kids are still in that phase where everything revolves around the parents.

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,520
When he's 12 and in the privacy of his friends, I'm sure he will say things about you that

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,320
you'd never think he was capable of.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,000
And that's okay, because you did it in the privacy of your friends when you were 12 too.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,040
Every kid says, even if they don't truly mean it, my dad is a hard ass or my mom sucks,

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,640
as long as they know they're not going to be caught.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,860
It doesn't mean that your kids hate you, it just means that they're growing into a more

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,160
independent phase of life, and they're figuring out its boundaries.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,220
An attitude of irreverence is the discovery mechanism of this process.

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,960
When you're a child, you're given rules.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,480
They're not only there to keep you safe, but to, broadly speaking, let you know what

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
is good and evil in the world.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,380
The teen years, however, are when you test the rules, so that you may discover for yourself

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,680
why something is good or evil.

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,480
And sometimes, though rarely, you might discover that a rule is legitimately outdated, that

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,280
what it guards against is no longer relevant, that the outside world has changed.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,080
For example, it made sense not to eat pork and shellfish in an era of foodborne parasites

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,880
and diseases, but in practical terms, that's a problem we've largely figured out nowadays.

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,640
I am going to stress, though, testing the rules and discovering they need changing is

40
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,580
a lot less common than most teenagers think.

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,560
The 90s and 2000s was an era where irreverence was really considered a positive quality.

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,160
Yes, you had the anti-war, free-love, commune-dwelling hippies of the 60s and 70s.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,080
They were certainly irreverent, and garnered their fair share of scorn from the previous

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
generation.

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,440
But appreciation for those values and aesthetics that made those decades only came about after

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
their time had passed.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,360
To contrast, the 90s and 2000s knew exactly what they were, while they were, and it was

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
irreverent.

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,800
The trend certainly got its start in the late 80s, where popular culture began to push child

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,560
and teenage protagonists who genuinely did not give a flip about normal responsibilities,

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,600
instead opting for hijinks and adventures.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,840
But it was the 90s where everything became that, and every kid wanted to be that.

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
Who didn't want to be a teenage superhero?

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,720
School seemed like an institutionalized joke designed to rob us of our youth, and adulthood

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,760
seemed like a gap that we would never be able to bridge.

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,320
Of course, everyone bridges it eventually, and as I mentioned in a previous video, if

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,800
people's politics change over time, they're more likely to drift more rightward than anything

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
else.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,260
However, this doesn't happen exactly the same way all the time.

60
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,600
When the conservatism of age begins to bloom, it grows out of the compost of the values

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,060
held in youth.

62
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,840
Those hippies eventually became my generation's parents, the dreaded boomers.

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,800
And sometimes it's hard for me to square away in my head that today's older Karens were

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,260
the same people putting flowers into rifle barrels.

65
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,040
While the hippies certainly had their socialist positions, they were also staunch individualists

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,460
in their rejection of the traditional religious collective order.

67
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,880
The GI generation enjoyed the Roaring Twenties, suffered during the Great Depression, and

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,900
then fought in World War II, running the gamut from progressive overindulgence to societal

69
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,880
collapse to conservative responsibility.

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,200
Meanwhile, my generation, the Millennials, largely rejected the neo-conservatism typical

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
of the 90s.

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,800
From the religious like Pat Robertson, to the censorious like Jack Thompson, to the

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,600
corporatist like George Bush, to the insane like Jack Chick.

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,040
And as Millennials are aging now, they are expressing their own form of conservatism.

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,040
And if the exploration that characterized their youth was steeped in the worship of

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,440
youth's own irreverent quality, their conservatism seems to be the complete rejection of irreverence.

77
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,880
Call me a killjoy, but I think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should

78
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,300
be able to enjoy it.

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,880
The 90s is known for the creation of three unique types of irreverence.

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,180
The first is gross-out humor, snot and shit, farts and burps, throwing up and weird foods

81
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,700
and all manner of tie-dyed mystery slime.

82
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,900
This was the humor of the young millennial kid.

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,780
Meanwhile, kids who were a bit older may have had the opportunity to enjoy the second type

84
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,620
of irreverence, which was less visceral, the sarcastic comedy.

85
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,540
Consider The Simpsons, South Park, or a bit later on, Family Guy episodes of the era.

86
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,780
Every joke was allowed.

87
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,700
Every topic could be made fun of.

88
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,580
Every curse word and slur was uttered, even if only past the watershed.

89
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,060
Yeah, some of them were bleeped, but we knew what they were saying.

90
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,640
And beyond just cartoons and comedies, do you think this scene in Die Hard 3 could be

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
made now?

92
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,500
Certainly not, but I don't recall people saying it was racist back then.

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,220
In fact, the point of it is that McClain isn't racist.

94
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,420
He's forced into this situation under threat of a bomb going off.

95
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,600
And the point of the scene, for our purposes outside the movie, is that the 90s had a blanket

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,780
default assumption of non-racism.

97
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,740
And he's breaking that assumption openly and explicitly against his will.

98
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,100
And so, we laugh at the situation.

99
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,580
People weren't really screeching and demanding inclusivity and diversity and all the other

100
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,540
buzzwords we hear today back then.

101
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,340
General goodwill among your common citizen was assumed.

102
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,820
The Griller meme was the reality of this era.

103
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,420
Yes, there were still racists, but they were reviled for their stupidity.

104
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,420
And when we noticed them, we called them racists, and others actually understood what that meant.

105
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,560
Because we didn't just throw around that term wantonly, using it to describe anybody

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,960
and everybody who disagreed with our views, diluting it to the point that it was no longer

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
useful.

108
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Thanks for that, Progs.

109
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,040
While The Simpsons has turned into a shambling corpse that should have been cancelled 20

110
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,720
seasons ago, and Family Guy is now run by people openly admitting that the old episodes

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,040
are so edgy that they're ashamed of them, South Park continues to be irreverent, even

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,120
though the era of 90s irreverence has been replaced by the progressive puritanism of

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
the current year.

114
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,600
Soccer moms back then were screaming that South Park was turning their kids into little

115
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,920
sociopaths, with those irreverent depictions of Jesus and Satan, and how Saddam Hussein

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,320
was hanging around in hell, and how Kenny violently died every episode.

117
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,200
Woke's Golds now are screaming that South Park's continued irreverence, but now towards

118
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,000
modern views of transgenderism and social justice, mirrors that old outrage.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,200
It's kinda like how conservative Christians burned Harry Potter books before, and leftoids

120
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,280
burned them now.

121
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,920
These are both ultimately puritanical reactions to the liberal values of free speech, just

122
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,720
coming from the left instead of the right.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,600
And this is where we get to the core of the matter.

124
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,720
Equality before the law, consent of the governed, freedom to speak and to choose and to think,

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,960
these things require a certain degree of irreverence.

126
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,840
We must be able to make fun of public figures and speak controversial things for a liberal

127
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,240
society to function.

128
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,920
Irreverence is not only the culture of the 90s, or the method by which the youth define

129
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,520
themselves, it is also one of the mechanisms by which a free society is actually free.

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,840
Which is why the Woke's Gold millennials of today, in reacting against irreverence,

131
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,880
also ultimately end up reacting against freedom itself.

132
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,800
South Park was where I first figured out this connection between the Woke's Gold's aging

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
and neo-puritanism.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,200
I'm a millennial myself.

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,040
I am also aging, you zoomers, but I still enjoy irreverent humor, which is probably

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,520
the reason why most S.A.W.s my age think I'm childish.

137
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,440
And sure, I'm always going to be a kid at heart, I think that's even healthy on some

138
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,800
level to retain youthful energy and optimism.

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,520
But you know, I actually have grown up where it counts.

140
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,840
I'm just still an irreverent person because it's a better, more free way to be.

141
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,240
But the people who rebel against irreverence, almost always shed out takes like this, eventually.

142
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,280
Everyone recognizes that Gamergate was a practice run for the resurgence of fascism,

143
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,680
but we don't talk enough about how there's a straight line from South Park to the kind

144
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,840
of online white nationalist humor that gradually became not a joke at all.

145
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,480
When I was a kid, the notion that everyone who was ever offended by anything was an idiot

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,760
had common currency, and fortunately all my friends eventually realized that was wrong,

147
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,160
but a lot of people didn't and those people are now Nazis.

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,520
You can see it, can't you?

149
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,200
Now that you've heard me ramble about the 90s and irreverence for a while, can you see

150
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,140
what I see in this passage?

151
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,400
This person is reacting against the pop culture of their youth, and decrying others who haven't,

152
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,640
in their view, grown up.

153
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,720
Even though the 90s were culturally, literally so close to the liberal idea of fairness and

154
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,460
freedom that abandoning irreverence means regressing back towards Puritanism.

155
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,400
Their only option to salvage this garbage position is to say that the irreverence didn't

156
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,560
belie a generalized rebellious attitude towards authority, but instead a latent fascism, since

157
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,640
to be irreverent to the current progressive modern culture cannot be framed in any other

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
way if they want to maintain a semblance of a moral high ground.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,680
Just as D&D players had to be Satan worshippers and gamers had to be school shooters, people

160
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,520
who like edgy jokes have to be Nazis.

161
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,780
It's all out of the Puritans handbook.

162
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,120
In retrospect, it seems impossible to overstate the cultural damage done by South Park, the

163
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,600
show that portrayed earnestness as the only sin, and taught that mockery is the ultimate

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
inoculation against all criticism.

165
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,100
You have, once again, missed the point.

166
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,020
What South Park teaches is that everything can be mocked, and that it should be.

167
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,200
There should be no sacred cows.

168
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Everyone gets their turn.

169
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,320
It's a shame Ed Sheeran didn't figure it out, but don't worry, I'm sure he got

170
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,160
over his life being ruined with his millions of dollars.

171
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,180
That third type of 90s irreverence that I skipped over earlier, alongside gross out

172
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,020
humor and sarcastic comedy, is probably best described as extreme slapstick.

173
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,780
From prank shows like Punk'd, to stunt and injury shows like MXC, this type of media

174
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,260
was a mixture of real, caught-on-camera style footage with the choreographed stunts of a

175
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
traditional movie.

176
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,740
In other words, you were watching action, but it was real.

177
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,860
Skateboard crashes where people really lose a tooth or break a leg.

178
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,180
Actual fights and arguments generally accompanied by a live-league logo in the corner.

179
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,700
Real pranks and trolls on unsuspecting people.

180
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,660
What links all of these things together is authenticity.

181
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,100
Jackass is considered the pinnacle of irreverent culture, as it combined all three types.

182
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,860
Gross out, sarcastic comedy, and extreme slapstick, all in one movie.

183
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm actually really surprised that a fourth Jackass movie is on the way, because just

184
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,420
as soccer moms back then said it was inappropriate, what was goals today are probably calling

185
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,420
it problematic.

186
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,340
Within the past year or so, I've recently re-watched all three Jackass movies with friends,

187
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,500
and all I could think throughout them was, there's no way this would get made today.

188
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,180
Everything's gotten so much more repressive since the old days.

189
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,180
MXC, same thing.

190
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,500
There's actually a Twitch channel where all the episodes of MXC are aired on repeat.

191
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,900
And I'm surprised it's still up, because every time I tune in over there, there's

192
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,500
immediately a joke that would never fly on the internet today.

193
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,620
I guess Twitch just hasn't realized it yet.

194
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,820
Uh, we've had reports that one of our prisoners is missing, but don't worry, Guy is on orange

195
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,380
alert and nothing will get by me, Guy, huh?

196
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,380
Hey baby doll.

197
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,140
Ha ha ha ha, Guy likes.

198
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,820
There's a million other examples as well.

199
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,300
Spike advertisements for video games that are overtly sexual are disgusting by today's

200
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,580
woke standards, but they were just normal back then.

201
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,060
Edge sold, simple as that.

202
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,860
And even as the edgy era began to fall out of touch, game companies continued to use

203
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,660
those same tactics, right up until it got them canceled by the game journals of the

204
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
day.

205
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,140
Spike TV, the well-known Network for Men that pioneered MXC, also aired many similar

206
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,740
types of shows, stuff that was steeped in all sorts of irreverence.

207
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,140
The early internet also mirrored this attitude, from 4chan to YTMND to Newgrounds.

208
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,700
With eBOMB's world stealing at all, it was all edgy content.

209
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,580
Even though Urban Dictionary is heavily woke-ified nowadays, it was a bastion of Edge 20 years

210
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
ago.

211
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,300
And occasionally, some Prague will find an old entry and kick up a big stink on Twitter

212
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,620
about how people used to use the slang, gay fart, to describe a fart that smelled of cum.

213
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,100
As the internet's earliest content creators got off the ground in the mid to late 2000s,

214
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,060
the reverence culture was still in full swing, and it showed.

215
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,940
Tourette's Guy is amazingly, hilariously offensive.

216
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,180
It's the guy who does skits, acting like the worst possible stereotype of somebody

217
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,180
with threats.

218
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,620
This is the kind of stuff that went viral back in 2006.

219
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,380
Angry Video Game Nerd also got his start in this era, and is also a show based in a reverence

220
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,900
culture, incessantly screaming curse words about old Nintendo games, and even real-life

221
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,260
prank calling a hardware store and reviewing Atari porn games in early episodes.

222
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,560
James Rolfe would never do that shit nowadays.

223
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,040
And I personally have extremely vivid memories.

224
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,140
It's been totally scrubbed off the internet by now, I'm sure.

225
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,720
I have a Doug Walker video.

226
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
That guy with the glasses.

227
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Channel Awesome.

228
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,760
Five second movie review of Batman and Robin.

229
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,760
And all it is, is a video of his ass hovering over a toilet while a shit log falls out of

230
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
it.

231
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Wait, wait, wait.

232
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
This is the dev of the future, while editing the video.

233
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,600
I found it on the internet archive, and it's just how I remember it.

234
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,900
I'm not going to put it in the video, I don't want to get banned, but it's in the description.

235
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,320
And holy shit, literally.

236
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,400
The ethics of irreverence really does boil down to, everybody gets a shot.

237
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,540
Every skater kid gets to try the jump.

238
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,120
Everyone gets laughed at when they fail, praised when they succeed.

239
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,260
And given their due for taking a shot regardless of outcome.

240
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,080
Everybody gets pranked, and everybody laughs.

241
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,480
Knowing full well that tomorrow, they will be pranked by today's victim, and laughed

242
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
at.

243
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,840
Everybody gets a slur thrown their way, knowing that it's all in jest.

244
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,700
Understanding that differences exist, but not letting them divide or define.

245
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,720
A logical good fit with this ethic is the gamer space.

246
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,280
A community that's competitive and rowdy by its very nature, but ultimately inclusive

247
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,620
as long as you can game.

248
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,120
You can smack talk somebody's race or gender, but in the end, the leaderboard doesn't

249
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
lie.

250
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,640
The game unfolds, and rejecting the ethics of irreverence, reject the fairness, the humor,

251
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,260
the camaraderie, and the competition.

252
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,740
Where gamergate began as a gamers are dead styled rejection of gamers, by the anti-gamers

253
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,080
who wheeled their way into power within the gaming space, what gamergate actually was,

254
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,580
underneath all the accusations of sexism, underneath the culture war, was the first

255
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,820
real push of the rejection of irreverence.

256
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,640
And this has finally been directly said, laid out for all to see, eight years later.

257
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,380
Here's a Facebook comment that went viral.

258
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,660
It boggles my fucking mind how we lost gamers to the right.

259
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,900
Feminism is the biggest cause of the decline of gaming.

260
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,220
Microtransactions, loot crates, pay to win, selling games piecemeal, charging full price

261
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,840
for garbage that'll get fixed later, relying on modders, monopolistic growth relying on

262
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,160
removing competition.

263
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,720
Gaming is a microcosm of the failures of capitalism, and all gamers think is, look how feminism

264
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,520
diversity is ruining my video games.

265
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,360
This is actually a somewhat reasonable critique of some of the problems with gaming right

266
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,760
now, but the even more viral reply to this post is jaw dropping.

267
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,720
I'm not going to read it all, it's like a 100 tweet thread, but the full thing is

268
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,460
in the description and worth seeing in detail to understand the brains of these people.

269
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,260
When was the last time you saw a left wing gaming clan?

270
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,860
The reactionary politics is baked into the mechanics, and they're exposed to it at

271
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,740
increasingly younger ages, where their primary social contact is with people who get them

272
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,940
to enforce hierarchies of competition.

273
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,540
Competitive games are designed to attract people who like conquering.

274
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,840
Why do you think 4X games are so prone to fanbases who are viscerally reactionary gamers?

275
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,120
It's in the genre definition, 4X is a colonialism power fantasy, they're on the front lines

276
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
of the excess of capitalism.

277
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,760
The only message they receive is, when my guy was in, things were fine, now I have to

278
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,340
be the guy or make the guy.

279
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,180
They need a despot to rule them and tell them what to do, because their entire social hierarchy

280
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
depends on it.

281
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,440
If leftists want to convert gamers to leftist politics, they have to do on the ground advocacy

282
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,460
in an engaging way via clans, esport teams, and larger communities.

283
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,500
However, that will always struggle against the fundamental mechanics of these games that

284
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,540
select for this behaviour.

285
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,840
With the lens of, Wokesgold's reject the irreverence of childhood and the ethics behind

286
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,400
it in mind, go back and listen to that passage again.

287
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,720
Do you see what she's saying?

288
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,480
Competition itself is problematic, because the type of person that is competitive rejects

289
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,720
the mass equality of socialism and prefers to climb hierarchies of merit, and because

290
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,500
games are about challenges to overcome, enemies to vanquish, lands to conquer, princesses

291
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,540
to save, puzzles to solve, they will always be challenging, they will always be hierarchical,

292
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,380
and they will always be problematic.

293
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,180
Hammergate was always about a hatred of games, the hatred of gamers was icing on the cake

294
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,240
to these people.

295
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,000
As for why hate games, I can only speculate, but I've had to guess.

296
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,800
It would be that a well-adjusted adult is somebody who, as a child, engaged in play

297
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,280
both solo and with others, and was socialized by that play.

298
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,440
If you want to create damaged, subverted, and undisciplined adults, you must subvert

299
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
their play.

300
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Subverting games is one very popular vector to do this with, but they're using Gramsci's

301
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,700
playbook everywhere with the same goal.

302
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Creating irreverence, how it was the youth culture 20 years ago, how it's being rebelled

303
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,800
against now, and why they're rebelling, explains every single Prague movement and talking

304
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,760
point since before gamergate, and the reason I've decided to do this video now is because

305
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,440
of the recent G4 debacle.

306
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,160
G4 launched in 2002 with the express purpose of competing with tech TV, but with programming

307
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,260
aimed at MTV's demographics, teens and young adults, and like MTV, it was inundated with

308
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,480
irreverence culture.

309
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,820
And while its programming revolved around video games, computers, and technology, its

310
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,940
tone and style stuck to the skits, pranks, rude jokes, and sex appeal that was popular

311
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
at the time.

312
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,020
By 2006, the channel had to broaden its focus to attract viewers.

313
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,260
By 2009, the channel was experiencing significant cutbacks and layoffs, and by 2014, the network

314
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,420
completely closed, having been entirely replaced by YouTubers and streamers online.

315
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,300
But nonetheless, G4 is remembered fondly by its fans, with its flagship show, Attack of

316
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,980
the Show, still adored by gamers.

317
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,120
G4 relaunched on YouTube last year, and their channel is dead, it's a graveyard.

318
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,120
They've got half a million subs, and they get the same views that I do.

319
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,720
Meanwhile, they've got 20 people on staff to pay for it all, plus all their very expensive

320
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
looking sets.

321
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,900
I can't imagine this thing is making any money.

322
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,160
So when your failing revival of an already failed brand is failing to compete against

323
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,160
the people who replaced you a decade ago, is about to sink again, what is your business

324
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
strategy?

325
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,440
Is it to blame the people who should have been your viewers, the people who remember

326
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,560
G4 as a part of their childhood or teen years?

327
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,700
Would you be surprised if the answer to that question is a resounding yes?

328
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,820
But I actually want to talk about something so much more important than Red Dead Online.

329
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,380
Sexism in gaming.

330
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:17,900
In joining G4, this is a conversation we've been having since a full fucking decade ago,

331
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,440
where Zoe Quinn cheated on Aaron Joni, with two full Greyhound buses worth of people.

332
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,640
And the conversation always goes like this, you suck, your show sucks, and that's why

333
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
you get vitriol.

334
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
That's it.

335
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,160
Every time G4 is brought up in various channels, even in this YouTube channel, we have the

336
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,500
chat in front of us, I can see you, without a doubt, there will be backlash, because I'm

337
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,160
not as bangable as the previous hosts.

338
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
It's somehow-

339
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,680
Talk to him, Frost!

340
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,580
It has somehow been expected that you can talk about how much you jerked off to women

341
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
as a compliment.

342
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
It's not a compliment!

343
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
It's weird!

344
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm going to go ahead and be the contrarian once again, and say, you know what, disregarding

345
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,240
her personality of course, that's a pretty big thing to disregard, this girl is actually

346
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,820
kind of cute in her own way.

347
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,760
The blonde, short haired petite girl is certainly a type, it's why so many people were fapping

348
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,660
it to Kes on Voyager or that psychic chick from Judge Dredd.

349
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,460
Suicide Girls was full of tatted up short haired blondes, and this look was for a time

350
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,420
incredibly popular, though maybe this is just me showing my age because the appeal

351
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,140
of Suicide Girls was downstream from a reverence culture.

352
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,040
Um, for you zoomers out there, Suicide Girls was basically a porn site that exclusively

353
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,800
catered to alt girls with tattoos, piercings, and punk hairstyles.

354
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,500
In an era before video streaming, your choices were buying porn DVDs or porn off satellite

355
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,680
TV, downloading porn videos from Kazaa or Limewire, or looking at pictures, and the

356
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,520
only place that was doing alt girls was Suicide Girls.

357
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,220
And fun fact, that's where Zoe Quinn posted her nudes back in the day too.

358
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,900
The point is though, I know very well the aesthetic she's appealing to, and she does

359
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,380
look like she could have made a few bucks in that site back in the day.

360
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,820
Give yourself a bit more credit, girl.

361
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,340
Women do not exist to be nice on the eyes for you, Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not

362
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,180
exist to be nice on the eyes for you.

363
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,340
Oh no, oh no, roll the clips.

364
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,740
Sexism in gaming.

365
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,940
Here we go again.

366
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,060
Morgan Webb, Olivia Munn did not exist to be nice on the eyes for you.

367
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Oh crap.

368
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Just roll it.

369
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,980
Sexism objectifies women, hates women, sexist, sexism woman.

370
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,660
Half of our producers and writers are women.

371
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
Okay, first of all Kevin.

372
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,540
This is not a regulation dog, so you're a raw dog in here.

373
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,780
It's really thick.

374
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,620
What makes this funny as shit is that this is exactly why these women existed.

375
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,620
It's why when Olivia Munn made the jump to the Daily Show, she lasted for a few skits

376
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,940
before disappearing, and nobody even noticing she was there.

377
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,220
It's why Morgan Webb hasn't done a single thing of note since G4 died.

378
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,980
Hell, I know this ain't G4, but back when the first Assassin's Creed dropped in like

379
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,740
2006 or whatever, and Ubisoft decided to push the whole Jade's Game angle, it's why the

380
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,420
comic of her sucking off all the nerds went viral.

381
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,500
Yes, clearly, women can provide more than their looks to the gaming space, but none

382
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,900
of these women did, and our memories are too long for you to be able to rewrite history.

383
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,740
And I wish I could turn the camera around so that you could see the incredible team

384
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,300
that make X-Play.

385
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,700
Half of our producers and writers are women.

386
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,100
Emily, Abby, Megan, Joe, Jake, Zipper, Gabby.

387
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,620
None of these people will be receiving a paycheck by 2023, and part of it will be because your

388
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,420
content isn't getting any traction, but most of it will be because of the backlash that

389
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,340
they're creating right now by attacking the only people who could ever possibly be interested

390
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
in watching you.

391
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,620
When you're in our DMs or on those YouTube comments or in Twitch chat right now, those

392
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,860
reactionary threads thinking that I'm somehow ruining your current X-Play experience because

393
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,980
you can't objectify me, how you previously did to Morgan, or that I'm somehow less qualified

394
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,300
to speak on something, but you can't quite put your finger on why, even though I'm reading

395
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,920
the exact same script as Adam, but you have no problem with his part of it, you're letting

396
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,040
your unconscious biases ruin my day and you're gatekeeping the gaming space.

397
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
No.

398
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Gatekeeping is good.

399
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,560
I'm actually not doubting you're a gamer, I'm just doubting that you're a gamer I want

400
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
to listen to.

401
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,960
Like I said in the last video, you can't actually be gatekept from games.

402
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,240
But now that you're screaming that banter, that the camaraderie of everybody getting

403
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,220
their turn of being the butt of the joke, that the ethics of irreverence should not

404
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,200
apply to you because you have a vagina, that is, in fact, gatekeeping on your part.

405
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,400
If you don't like it, don't watch it.

406
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Peace!

407
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,920
You know what?

408
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Sounds good to me.

409
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,800
Also, look at her face after the camera's off her.

410
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Holy shit.

411
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,640
That chat she's watching must be lacing into her for her stupidity.

412
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,560
She can't take it that nobody agrees with her, and that she's just very well made of

413
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,680
tanked her own fucking show due to her ego.

414
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,600
Also, look at Gerard over there, he's sitting like he's taking a shit into his chair.

415
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,120
Another Gerard of ten years ago is not a woke-schooled like he is now.

416
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,920
I wonder if that younger, slimmer Gerard is still inside the fat one, looking out at the

417
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,600
modern world but unable to affect it, watching horrifically as his body is puppeted for these

418
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
dark purposes.

419
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,360
I began the previous video, that one about gatekeeping, with my own background because

420
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,600
I wanted to make it known that I'm invested in the topic.

421
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,560
My friend Arch, the king of gatekeeping videos, said on stream later that he didn't quite

422
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,240
get it, that to him it sounded like I was complaining about being bullied.

423
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,600
And fair enough, I don't actually think I brought it all together in the end like I

424
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
wanted to.

425
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,240
The point I was making was, in order for you to truly care about some hobby, some subculture,

426
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,320
some community, you have to have that level of attachment to it.

427
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,360
I'm not gonna sit here and say it was like I got abused or something, but yeah, you gotta

428
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,720
suffer at least a little bit to truly enjoy something, you know?

429
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,960
You gotta take your lumps to be accepted into the group.

430
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,420
But this?

431
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,780
This is a woman who's clearly suffering, sure, but she's not taking her lumps, so she's not

432
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,280
being accepted into the group.

433
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,680
She's complaining about the lumps, and then complaining further about the rejection.

434
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,400
It sounds strange to say it, but intuitively this phrase feels right.

435
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,080
On some levels she's not a real gamer, no zoomer can be, the way that we are, because

436
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,800
they never got ostracized like we did.

437
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,640
However, does that mean that ostracization is required to be a gamer?

438
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
No, I don't think so.

439
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,820
Maybe it's that she completely lacks respect for people who were ostracized.

440
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,200
She got in on a free pass, and then complained about, and then later prolonged, the suffering

441
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,560
of those who came before.

442
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,840
Yeah, that's what it is.

443
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,740
It's not that she's not a real gamer, it's that she has no respect for gamers who are

444
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
not like her.

445
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,240
Again, I'm not talking like this is some kind of racial oppression level of suffering, that's

446
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
just stupid.

447
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
But we did get teased for being gamers, and we grew from it.

448
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
She didn't.

449
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,580
And now that she is being teased, she's sulking with the children that we were.

450
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,180
This new G4 isn't going to last.

451
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,380
Watch their social blade over the next few months, after the spotlight moves on from

452
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,380
them.

453
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,900
We're already seeing the immediate loss of subs due to backlash, but after that levels

454
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,580
out, I do also expect a slow abandonment of their audience and gradual decrease of views

455
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
over time.

456
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,840
The general gaming public does not give a shit about G4 anymore, they've long since

457
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,880
been replaced by twitch streamers and youtubers.

458
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,260
The only people who are watching G4 now, are people who had fond memories of G4 from back

459
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,420
then, and you just told them that they're shit, the show they loved is shit.

460
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,620
The ethics of irreverence that made the show what it was, are shit, and how they all need

461
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,780
to grow up and get with the demoralization.

462
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,020
You will not last, and the internet will be better when you're gone.

463
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,380
I'm not even somebody who watched G4, but I'm willing to bet that, after viewing this

464
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,500
shit show, old school fans are now nostalgic for that dark era during G4's decline, where

465
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,620
all they played were back to back reruns of Campus PD and Star Trek The Next Generation.

466
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,120
Women.

467
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,820
Sexism.

468
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,320
Women.

469
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,820
Women.

470
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,320
Bangable.

471
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,820
Sexist.

472
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,620
Sexism.

473
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,120
Woman.

474
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,420
Jerked off to women.

475
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:28,920
Women.

476
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
If you don't like it, don't watch it.
