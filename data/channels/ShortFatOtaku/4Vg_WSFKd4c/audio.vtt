00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
All right, now that the book of Bubba Fett is over, let me give you my take on it.

00:03.520 --> 00:04.880
It was awful, thanks for watching!

00:05.840 --> 00:10.160
Right, that's not going to hit the eight minute minimum for full monetization on YouTube, is it?

00:10.160 --> 00:12.480
Naomi and I have had a ritual now for a few years.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.160
Every Thursday morning we gather up all the episodes of the various shows that we're

00:16.160 --> 00:20.800
currently watching, make a big breakfast and have coffee, and lounge about for several hours and

00:20.800 --> 00:26.080
play catch-up. We do this with both old shows that Naomi's never seen that I can rewatch with her,

00:26.080 --> 00:29.120
as well as new shows that have new episodes coming out every week.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.000
Most recently we've done this with Twin Peaks, both old and new,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.760
Star Trek, both old and new, Attack on Titan, and The Mandalorian.

00:35.760 --> 00:40.720
The Mandalorian is a pretty interesting show, all things considered. Let's see if I can describe how.

00:40.720 --> 00:46.000
When Disney bought Lucasfilm, something like 50 years of expanded universe canon was wiped out.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.120
As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.720
Disney announced that in order to make things less restrictive for their writers,

00:54.720 --> 00:59.120
they weren't going to completely follow the EU canon. Where Luke gets with Mara Jade,

00:59.120 --> 01:04.240
and Admiral Thrawn is going around being badass, and the Yuuzhan Vong invade, and Han Solo's son

01:04.240 --> 01:08.720
Jason Solo becomes Darth Katius and is killed by his twin sister. No, I'm not worried about

01:08.720 --> 01:12.480
spoilers of decades old stories that are officially non-canon now, as cool as they are.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.160
And hey, you know what? I get it. How much of a surprise would it have been, and how

01:16.160 --> 01:20.800
restrictive for the creators, if episode 7 was about Admiral Thrawn, episode 8 about the Vong,

01:20.800 --> 01:25.840
and episode 9 about Darth Katius? Sometimes you just need room for new stories. I don't like this

01:25.840 --> 01:30.720
whole wipe the slate clean tendency, when you should be cultivating properties, not destroying

01:30.720 --> 01:39.360
them. But at the very least, Disney didn't wipe any mainline movies or whatever, so there's that.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.280
Therefore, after Disney took control of Star Wars, the new canon looks something like this.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.320
The prequel trilogy from 1999-2005, set during the first half of Anakin Skywalker's life.

01:48.320 --> 01:54.800
The original trilogy from 1977-1983, set 20 years later. And the Clone Wars TV series. No,

01:54.800 --> 01:59.920
not the good Tartovsky one, that was overwritten by the shittier CG version. Everything else was

01:59.920 --> 02:05.760
made non-canon, and placed under the label of Star Wars Legends. From garbage-tier stuff like

02:05.760 --> 02:10.000
the courtship of Princess Leia, to the story of the founding of the Rebellion from The Force

02:10.000 --> 02:14.800
Unleashed, it was all rendered moot. Future Disney-owned outings would properly tell the

02:14.800 --> 02:19.440
story of Princess Leia's romance, or how the Rebellion symbol came to be, thank you very much.

02:19.440 --> 02:24.400
While some Legends characters would later return, reimagined for the new lore, the only thing that

02:24.400 --> 02:29.440
was considered foundational as far as Disney was concerned, is the two trilogies in the Clone Wars

02:29.440 --> 02:34.080
series. Afterward, they began to add their own new entries, and boy were they shit. I've already

02:34.080 --> 02:38.480
gone over the sequel trilogy in detail in a previous video, but even beyond them, Rogue One

02:38.480 --> 02:43.760
was shit, Star Wars Rebels was shit, Solo was so shit it caused the cancellation of the upcoming

02:43.760 --> 02:49.200
Boba Fett and Obi-Wan films. While mainline Star Wars turned itself into a public mockery,

02:49.200 --> 02:53.440
at Disney immolating the property for short-term gain and destroying its legacy in the process,

02:53.440 --> 02:58.240
a subtler, less bombastic, and far more interesting show quietly released, and that

02:58.240 --> 03:03.440
show was The Mandalorian. The Mandalorian's first episode came out on November 12th, 2019,

03:03.440 --> 03:08.240
a month before Star Wars Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker. And even though Episode IX was this

03:08.240 --> 03:12.640
billion-dollar blockbuster, with constant advertising, and merch, and toys, this thing

03:12.640 --> 03:16.400
was shoved everywhere you could fucking look, people really didn't like it. It made money,

03:16.400 --> 03:20.240
yeah, but way less than it should have, especially considering its budget, and the story was

03:20.240 --> 03:26.000
absolutely atrocious. But most importantly of all, it was completely upstaged and outshined by its

03:26.000 --> 03:30.240
smaller, quieter brother, The Mandalorian. The Rise of Skywalker was this bombastic,

03:30.240 --> 03:34.880
galaxy-spanning story about saving the universe from the first, uh, sorry, the final order now,

03:34.880 --> 03:39.760
with huge space battles and thousands of star destroyers with Death Star cannons on them,

03:39.760 --> 03:43.360
and there's a race against time to use an ancient Sith dagger to unlock a puzzle,

03:43.360 --> 03:46.800
and there's the wreckage of the Death Star on Endor, and Emperor Palpatine returns as a

03:46.800 --> 03:50.400
primordial Sith evil who's been alive for thousands of years, still not giving a shit

03:50.400 --> 03:55.040
about spoilers, by the way, while The Mandalorian is a story about a bounty hunter who goes to the

03:55.040 --> 03:58.960
seedy underbellies of planets to try and find work. The stakes are lower, and that's a good

03:58.960 --> 04:03.120
thing. There's more room to breathe, there's more time for character development, there's no sensory

04:03.120 --> 04:07.440
overload of a billion ships all firing at each other in a space battle to end all space battles,

04:07.440 --> 04:11.360
at least until the next movie comes out. The Mandalorian knows when to have loud action,

04:11.360 --> 04:15.760
and when to be quiet for a little while. Do you recall when Star Trek Picard was billed

04:15.760 --> 04:20.560
as this quieter show about Picard in his old age, not getting into his own huge space fights,

04:20.560 --> 04:25.280
but instead being involved in a smaller story around town? Which brings back Patrick Stewart,

04:25.280 --> 04:29.760
as next-generation Captain Jean-Luc Picard embraces a more deliberate pace that matches

04:29.760 --> 04:35.120
its 79-year-old star, finding Jean-Luc on his French vineyard as he spends time with his loyal

04:35.120 --> 04:40.400
dog Number One. That means fewer space shootouts and more quiet introspection, and that's just how

04:40.400 --> 04:45.280
the team behind Picard intended it. And then they turn Picard into a giant pile of space laser dog

04:45.280 --> 04:50.800
shit. Well, The Mandalorian is actually for Star Wars, what Picard was advertised to be for Star

04:50.800 --> 04:54.880
Trek. Another point in The Mandalorian's favor, which is equally important but a lot easier to

04:54.880 --> 04:58.960
explain, is that in the timeline it takes place between the original and sequel trilogy. A lot of

04:58.960 --> 05:02.800
extra Star Wars stuff takes place between the prequel trilogy and the original. The era of

05:02.800 --> 05:07.600
The Rise of the Empire has been explored to death, but the time period between Luke and Rey is still

05:07.600 --> 05:11.280
pretty sparse, even now, so it's refreshing to get another look at how The New Republic works,

05:11.280 --> 05:15.920
or see the Empire in decline before the First Order shows up, especially from the point of view

05:15.920 --> 05:20.240
of a character who is not aligned with either faction like The Mandalorian. Also, there's Baby

05:20.240 --> 05:24.560
Yoda, which instantly became a meme, something that Disney was somehow not prepared for. So,

05:24.560 --> 05:29.760
when Christmas Time 2019 came around, they had all of this worthless Episode 9 merch that nobody

05:29.760 --> 05:33.840
wanted to buy, and they had to quickly rush out Baby Yoda branded stuff to meet the demand.

05:33.840 --> 05:39.280
Check this out, this is The Mandalorian merch from 2019. Look at this shit, it's low quality stills

05:39.280 --> 05:43.840
from the show printed onto shirts and mugs and phone cases. It looks like they quickly slapped

05:43.840 --> 05:49.040
it together on cafe press. How is it that Disney thought this shit was going to go gangbusters,

05:49.040 --> 05:53.440
but didn't even notice that the quiet little brother of Star Wars was calmly putting out a

05:53.440 --> 05:58.640
money-making machine? The first season of The Mandalorian respects Star Wars lore while artfully

05:58.640 --> 06:02.480
adding to it, positioning the Mandalorians as an order of people who are the mortal enemies

06:02.480 --> 06:06.240
of the Jedi, and have used their mastery of technology and weaponry to counter the Jedi's

06:06.240 --> 06:10.400
use of the Force. The Empire wants to experiment on Baby Yoda for some kind of Force-related

06:10.400 --> 06:13.920
Metachlorian bullshit, the Mandalorian decides to rescue him, and the two of them go bopping

06:13.920 --> 06:18.160
around the galaxy getting into trouble. There is an overarching plot, but each episode also functions

06:18.160 --> 06:21.680
as a standalone, where the Mandalorian comes into town, takes a job, solves the problem,

06:21.680 --> 06:25.760
and moves on. It's as much of a space western as Star Wars has ever been, and its simplicity works

06:25.760 --> 06:30.000
wonders. Season two of The Mandalorian is where it starts going into the shitter, presumably

06:30.000 --> 06:33.920
because at this point Disney noticed that they had tanked everything else Star Wars related,

06:33.920 --> 06:38.160
and The Mandalorian was the only thing earning them both money and the love of their audiences.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.280
The success of The Mandalorian season one, and the failure of both Solo and episodes eight and nine,

06:43.280 --> 06:48.320
caused a massive reorientation in Disney's plan. The Bubba Fett and Obi-Wan movies became TV shows,

06:48.320 --> 06:52.000
since people's attention has been shifting away from film and towards TV for over a decade now,

06:52.000 --> 06:56.080
and season two of The Mandalorian became less about telling good stories like season one,

06:56.080 --> 07:00.240
and more about setting up as many spin-off shows as possible. Bubba Fett shows up,

07:00.240 --> 07:04.560
and his show is given that coveted post-credits scene at the end of season two. Ahsoka Tano makes

07:04.560 --> 07:08.720
an appearance, and a full arc of the show exists solely to sideline The Mandalorian,

07:08.720 --> 07:13.280
and serve as a backdoor pilot for her upcoming show. Rangers of the New Republic is also a

07:13.280 --> 07:17.200
planned show, stemming from the recurring appearances of these guys. Basically, Disney

07:17.200 --> 07:20.080
noticed that the only thing that was taken off that they had made was The Mandalorian,

07:20.080 --> 07:23.840
so they hitched as many possible fucking things to it, guaranteeing that its own

07:23.840 --> 07:28.160
momentum ground to a halt. I haven't even talked about the book of Bubba Fett yet,

07:28.160 --> 07:32.000
and that's because you really do need to understand all of this stuff to know how much

07:32.000 --> 07:36.960
of an unmitigated disaster it is. But now, we're here. Bubba Fett is an iconic Star Wars character,

07:36.960 --> 07:41.360
but unlike the other iconic characters, he's a blank slate. Luke is young and naive, but

07:41.360 --> 07:45.440
good-hearted. He confronts evil before he's ready, and he's scarred by it. He matures,

07:45.440 --> 07:49.120
and conquers the enemy within and without. He's the hero. Han Solo is a bit more dirty,

07:49.120 --> 07:52.400
he's in it for the money. He's not above underhanded tricks or scheming or stealing,

07:52.400 --> 07:55.840
but when the chips are down, he'll do the right thing. Leia is the bureaucrat, trained in the

07:55.840 --> 07:59.360
art of politics, but not accustomed to doing fighting herself, and she grows into a capable

07:59.360 --> 08:03.600
military leader in her own right. Lando is the former scoundrel who goes straight. He now runs

08:03.600 --> 08:07.680
a respectable business, but he can't quite shake his sketchy past. He's a smooth talker and deal

08:07.680 --> 08:12.320
maker. Darth Vader is the quintessential villain, the tortured soul who regrets the mistakes of his

08:12.320 --> 08:16.880
youth, but he's in too deep to quit now. Bubba Fett is the guy with the cool armor and the cool

08:16.880 --> 08:21.120
ship, called Slave One even in the original canon, which Disney refuses to recognize ever

08:21.120 --> 08:29.280
again, always referring to it as Bubba Fett's ship, or my ship now. And he does have a couple

08:29.280 --> 08:33.040
of lines that make him sound like he's a ruthless dude, but most of the time he just stands in the

08:33.040 --> 08:37.680
background looking cool, until he unceremoniously gets smacked in the back by Han Solo in episode

08:37.680 --> 08:42.640
6, causing his jetpack to fuck up, sending him into the sarlacc pit. My point is, for some reason

08:42.640 --> 08:47.440
that I think just boils down to the rule of cool, fans treated Bubba Fett like he was a main Star

08:47.440 --> 08:52.240
Wars character, even though there wasn't really much to him. Even George Lucas was surprised that

08:52.240 --> 08:56.240
he was so beloved, saying he wouldn't have killed him if he had known. In the case of

08:56.240 --> 09:01.600
Bubba Fett's death, had I known he was going to turn into such a popular character, I probably

09:01.600 --> 09:07.280
would have made a little bit more exciting. Bubba Fett was just another one of the minions,

09:07.280 --> 09:14.320
another one of the bounty hunters and bad guys. But he became such a favorite of everybody,

09:14.320 --> 09:20.720
he said for having such a small part, he had a very large presence. And now that his history

09:20.720 --> 09:26.240
has been told in the first trilogy, you know, it makes it even more of a misstep that we wouldn't

09:26.240 --> 09:32.320
make more out of the event of his defeat, because most people don't believe he died anyway. I'd

09:32.320 --> 09:36.640
contemplate him putting that extra shot in where he climbs out of the hole, but you know, I figure

09:37.440 --> 09:41.920
it doesn't quite fit in the end. It's because he first showed up in the Star Wars Holiday Special?

09:41.920 --> 09:46.800
The Mandalorian Season 1 was Disney's way of making a Bubba Fett show without committing to it.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.880
Din Djarin looks like Bubba Fett. He behaves like a reasonable extrapolation of Bubba Fett's

09:50.880 --> 09:54.560
appearances from the original trilogy, and to a lesser extent his appearances as a child in

09:54.560 --> 09:59.040
the Clone Wars series. This was Disney dipping their toes into the Bubba Fett waters, and because

09:59.040 --> 10:03.600
it was extremely well received, they decided to fully lean into it. But in this case, fully lean

10:03.600 --> 10:07.760
in means Disney sends their billion-dollar wrecking ball crashing through everything.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.520
The Mandalorian Season 2 introduces Bubba Fett proper, looking for his armor,

10:11.520 --> 10:15.600
which Din Djarin just so happens to have. Fett gets it back, then he tags along for the rest

10:15.600 --> 10:19.680
of the season's adventures, before returning to Tatooine to take over Jabba the Hutt's now-vacant

10:19.680 --> 10:24.480
throne as crime lord. And holy shit, in both Season 2 and Bubba Fett's own show, does Bubba

10:24.480 --> 10:28.400
look ridiculous. He's just a fat old man wearing the armor of a character that should have died in

10:28.400 --> 10:32.080
the Sarlacc pit. Look at him in Return of the Jedi. He's a thin dude. Now he's got a chest

10:32.080 --> 10:36.960
that reeks of congested heart failure. His armor barely even hangs off of him. Like, okay, I get

10:36.960 --> 10:41.520
it. You hired the Jango Fett actor, and he's a bit too old for the roll-down. Fine. You know what you

10:41.520 --> 10:46.080
do? You scale the armor up and try to play it off, because keeping the armor tiny just makes him look

10:46.080 --> 10:50.240
ridiculous. Here, watch, I'll fucking fix it myself. You just take the armor, make sure its

10:50.240 --> 10:55.040
dimensions are locked into their current ratio, and just scale it up, make it a little bit bigger.

10:55.040 --> 10:59.600
There. It doesn't look good, but it looks better. The book of Bubba Fett was given seven episodes

10:59.600 --> 11:04.160
to cover the following. How Bubba Fett survived the Sarlacc pit. What he was doing between Return

11:04.160 --> 11:09.360
of the Jedi and his appearance in The Mandalorian. A five-year span of time. Establish why he wants

11:09.360 --> 11:14.320
to take over Jabba's throne, and make that desire link up properly with his actions and behaviors

11:14.320 --> 11:19.200
during The Mandalorian Season 2, and then have him actually go on his own quest to do that.

11:19.200 --> 11:24.320
That's a lot of story arcs to cram into seven episodes, seven hours of content, especially

11:24.320 --> 11:29.120
considering that the second half of the show goes back to focus on Din Djarin again and not

11:29.120 --> 11:34.400
Bubba Fett. And the show wraps up everything by the end of the season finale. The entire thing

11:34.400 --> 11:39.040
feels rushed and half-baked. The book of Bubba Fett opens with telling the story of that five-year

11:39.040 --> 11:43.680
gap, and it is a by-the-book hero journey. The descent into the underworld, the fundamental change

11:43.680 --> 11:48.080
in the self, and the return to civilization with newfound knowledge. In this instance, Fett wakes

11:48.080 --> 11:52.560
up inside of the Sarlacc pit in the middle of his own digestion, and he uses his armor's technology

11:52.560 --> 11:57.360
to escape it. Once he escapes, he collapses. Jawa's scavenge his armor, and the Sand People nurse him

11:57.360 --> 12:02.080
back to health, teaching him their ways of living. He becomes an honorary member of their tribe until

12:02.080 --> 12:06.480
they're killed by a speeder bike gang, upon which he returns to civilization. It's the best part of

12:06.480 --> 12:10.560
the show, and it mirrors other well-told tales. The hero suffers a tragedy and is thrust into

12:10.560 --> 12:14.720
the unknown. They need to survive it, learn from it, and eventually master it. They grow and change

12:14.720 --> 12:18.880
as a result. Eventually, the hero returns home, able to appreciate its comforts but irrevocably

12:18.880 --> 12:24.240
changed. Hell, it's Luke's story from the original Star Wars. The problem is, the reason this story

12:24.240 --> 12:29.040
archetype resonates with us, is because it also happens to us in real life. When you move out of

12:29.040 --> 12:32.800
your parents' house for the first time, when you're responsible for getting yourself up to go to class

12:32.800 --> 12:36.880
in university, when you're responsible for your own rent after getting your first real job, the

12:36.880 --> 12:41.600
same process is happening. It's not nearly as traumatic, but the parallel is there. You start off

12:41.600 --> 12:46.320
young, naive, secure at home, but that can't last forever. In order to truly grow up, you need to cut

12:46.320 --> 12:50.160
yourself loose from your support system and contend with an unfamiliar world. And when this

12:50.160 --> 12:55.200
happens in real life, it overwhelmingly happens to young people. It's for that reason that most

12:55.200 --> 13:00.320
heroes in fiction who undertake this process are young too. The reason the hero's journey is a story

13:00.320 --> 13:05.600
for the young, is because parts of human psychology undergo a crystallization process as we get older.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.000
Barring a major transformative event, like a hugely traumatic experience or a spiritual

13:10.000 --> 13:14.480
awakening or something, most adults don't go through this process the way that kids do, because

13:14.480 --> 13:18.480
adults have already gone through it and they've already learned how to go through it. In other

13:18.480 --> 13:22.880
words, when Boba Fett is swinging his gaffey stick with the Sand People, I knew what story the show

13:22.880 --> 13:27.280
was trying to tell, and all I could really think was, he's already gone through this, when his father

13:27.280 --> 13:32.400
was beheaded in front of him in episode two. There is no way what they've shown so far is as

13:32.400 --> 13:37.280
transformative an event as losing a parent at a young age. After the obligatory slaughter of the

13:37.280 --> 13:41.600
Sand People, which spurs Fett back to civilization, he goes looking for his armor, which is where the

13:41.600 --> 13:46.480
events of Mandalorian season two happen. Fett tags along because that's the deal that Din Djarin cuts

13:46.480 --> 13:51.120
with him for the return of his armor. After that, he decides to go back to Tatooine in his own show

13:51.120 --> 13:56.000
to rule the planet, and I spent most of the time wondering, why? You've been all over the galaxy,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.800
why do you want the throne of a backwater shithole? We're given exactly one line describing

14:00.800 --> 14:07.840
his motivations and it is this, I'm gonna kill that bloated pig who double-crossed me, take his throne.

14:07.840 --> 14:18.240
It's not even downstream of the tragic Sand People backstory we got earlier. Okay fine,

14:18.240 --> 14:22.560
you want to be your own boss, but why Tatooine? Why crime? Boba Fett's not even much of a crime lord.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.480
He's not nearly ruthless enough throughout his show to be effective at the job, which is even

14:26.480 --> 14:30.880
weirder because ruthlessness was the only noticeable character trait Boba Fett originally had.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.960
The real answer is because there wouldn't be a show otherwise. We need Jabba's palace and

14:34.960 --> 14:39.840
Tatooine and Rancor's and Wookiees and the green pig guys and all the other Star Wars shit, so

14:39.840 --> 14:44.720
why the fuck not? The show's meager present-day action is framed by the far more interesting

14:44.720 --> 14:49.040
flashback sequences, but once those flashbacks have run their course, the show starts being

14:49.040 --> 14:53.760
framed by cutaways to what Dinjarin is doing, how he's holding up without baby Yoda, what the other

14:53.760 --> 14:57.680
Mandalorians are up to. Man, I thought this was a spin-off show, I thought season two would

14:57.680 --> 15:01.840
introduce Boba Fett and then he'd go off onto a new adventure, but at this point the most interesting

15:01.840 --> 15:06.160
parts of the show are the times when we cut back to The Mandalorian, and that's when I realized

15:06.160 --> 15:11.600
this show, The Book of Boba Fett, was originally meant to be part of The Mandalorian. No, really!

15:11.600 --> 15:15.920
The series was originally conceptualized as The Mandalorian season 2.5 according to those who

15:15.920 --> 15:20.000
worked on it, and the production treated it as such. The first episode of The Book of Boba Fett

15:20.000 --> 15:24.640
was referred to as 301, the way a third season's first episode would be according to normal TV

15:24.640 --> 15:29.440
show convention. The music is more reminiscent of The Mandalorian than any other property,

15:44.880 --> 15:48.960
and the ending title crawl featuring concept art is directly pulled from The Mandalorian.

15:48.960 --> 15:54.080
The season's entire second half focuses more on The Mandalorian than Boba Fett, and the final shot

15:54.080 --> 15:58.240
of the last episode is The Mandalorian flying off to have a new adventure. Imagine being one

15:58.240 --> 16:02.560
of those die-hard fans of Boba Fett, waiting for decades for his own movie, his own show,

16:02.560 --> 16:06.960
something, and this is what you get. He's turned into a side character in his own show,

16:06.960 --> 16:10.800
he's nothing like he should have been, and the person who sidelines him is exactly what he

16:10.800 --> 16:15.120
should have been like. The actual plot of the present time events of The Book of Boba Fett

16:15.120 --> 16:19.680
is extremely paint by numbers. Boba Fett wants Jabba's throne. Jabba's cousins leave it to him

16:19.680 --> 16:23.360
after a short confrontation because the CG to do those characters is expensive, but the reason they

16:23.360 --> 16:26.880
give is because a new villainous group, the Pike Syndicate, is showing up on Tatooine to take over

16:26.880 --> 16:30.400
instead. The Pikes are extremely ruthless and they've bullied the other crime lords into

16:30.400 --> 16:34.160
submission, and of course it turns out in the end that they were also the ones who slaughtered Boba

16:34.160 --> 16:38.400
Fett's sand people tribe, because why the fuck not. Boba Fett manages to recruit a ragtag group

16:38.400 --> 16:41.920
of people to fight with him, including Fennec Shand, a new character who's been in multiple

16:41.920 --> 16:47.200
other Star Wars shows, bridging the lore gap between them. Two green pig guys who act as cannon

16:47.200 --> 16:51.600
fodder and predictably die at the end. A Wookiee because do you remember Chewbacca from Star Wars?

16:51.680 --> 16:57.040
And a biker gang. Except the bikers all drive on shiny futuristic Vespas and look like really

16:57.040 --> 17:01.920
bad cyberpunk cosplay. These guys are easily the worst part of the show. Look at this chase scene,

17:01.920 --> 17:06.560
it's fucking abysmal. Even my fat ass can run faster than these guys are going. They've got

17:06.560 --> 17:11.040
all this tense music blaring but this is no forest of ender let me tell you. These dudes are totally

17:11.040 --> 17:14.560
useless in a firefight too. They don't look like people who can shoot and they certainly don't act

17:14.560 --> 17:18.640
like it. Nothing like a superfluous spin to increase your accuracy am I right? I'll try

17:18.640 --> 17:23.920
spinning that's a good trick. Also what the fuck is that? Did you see that? Do you see this? You

17:23.920 --> 17:28.800
can see inside the facade of the sets from this angle. How do you miss this? How do you not CG

17:28.800 --> 17:34.320
this shit out? You guys spent 15 million dollars an episode on this and the city looks like the

17:34.320 --> 17:39.040
inside of my shed out back. Anyway Din Djarin also comes back to help out and when the war comes,

17:39.040 --> 17:43.440
Bubba Fett convinces the other crime lords and remain neutral while he and his like 10 guys

17:43.440 --> 17:47.840
fight off the entire pike syndicate which is a deal they all promptly break. So it's Bubba Fett

17:47.840 --> 17:52.480
and his 10 guys who fight off all the pikes and all the other syndicates and they just win. It's

17:52.480 --> 17:57.200
laughable they even directly say it. Our forces are quietly patrolling the streets of the old city.

17:58.240 --> 18:04.720
The pike syndicate has not yet arrived in numbers but the minute they do we will see them before

18:04.720 --> 18:10.400
they see us. The Gamorran guards are posted in the Platoonian territory at the starport and will

18:10.400 --> 18:15.920
alert us if any of the pike syndicate forces arrive. Chrisanton is in Trandoshan territory

18:15.920 --> 18:21.280
keeping tabs on the streets of the municipality in front of city hall. Drash and Skad are with

18:21.280 --> 18:27.040
the other mods keeping an eye on the workers district and the aquillish quarter. As you can see

18:27.600 --> 18:32.960
all our flanks are covered nobody is sneaking up on us. They're literally putting one or two dudes

18:32.960 --> 18:37.600
at each post. They're not a mafia, they're a club. They never credibly establish that anybody cares

18:37.600 --> 18:41.360
about Bubba Fett's organization but we've got a rush to the final confrontation where Bubba Fett

18:41.360 --> 18:45.600
manages to win because he pulls out his rancor. Okay yeah fair enough it's a cool sequence but

18:45.600 --> 18:50.320
it's unearned and that's the entire show cool but unearned. The overall plot is a lot like

18:50.320 --> 18:55.280
walking tall. Hero leaves civilization and learns new wisdom. Check. Hero returns home with newfound

18:55.280 --> 18:59.760
perspective. Check. Hero discovers his home is now overrun with baddies in his absence and he sets

18:59.760 --> 19:04.080
out to make things right. Check. Hero liberates the community and the townspeople spread rose

19:04.080 --> 19:08.800
petals along his path when he walks. Check. But none of it is earned. The skeleton of a solid plot

19:08.800 --> 19:12.240
is here. They never spend enough time developing any of the essential connections that would make

19:12.240 --> 19:15.840
the plot actually work. They never show the people suffering under the heel of the pikes

19:15.840 --> 19:19.760
or the hut cousins and they never show the people secretly crying out for Bubba Fett to save them.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.920
In the absence of popularity they don't establish that Bubba Fett has the numbers or the power to

19:23.920 --> 19:28.880
simply impose his will on the city. In fact they explicitly say he doesn't. I have plenty of

19:28.880 --> 19:34.480
critters. What I'm short on is muscle. They don't even establish why Bubba Fett wants to do it,

19:34.480 --> 19:39.040
not in any meaningful way. He just does it because Disney sees dollar signs. That's it.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.360
The book of Bubba Fett suffers from cool scene-itis. The Rancor fighting the robot

19:43.360 --> 19:47.920
scene was cool. Bubba Fett and Din Djarin fighting off wave after wave of gangsters was cool. The

19:47.920 --> 19:53.600
train heist was cool. But none of these scenes are earned. You earn a bombastic action set piece by

19:53.600 --> 19:57.840
giving your characters moments to breathe and develop. I'll give you two examples from the same

19:57.840 --> 20:02.640
show even. Game of Thrones season two. The Battle of Backwater is a huge action set piece and it's

20:02.640 --> 20:06.480
earned. It's slowly built up across the entire season. Characters are preparing for it and

20:06.480 --> 20:10.320
reacting to it. There's ample character growth and we're invested in the battle when it finally

20:10.320 --> 20:14.000
comes. It's not just that the action is cool. It's that we care about what happens to the people

20:14.000 --> 20:17.920
who are in it. Contrast that with the final season of Game of Thrones where the forces of light

20:17.920 --> 20:21.920
stupidly send out their Dothraki cavalry from their fortified position to attack the army of

20:21.920 --> 20:25.920
the dead. Not because it makes any sense. Not because any named characters are at stake. And

20:25.920 --> 20:30.800
not because we as the audience care. But because that visual of the wave of flaming swords blinking

20:30.800 --> 20:34.960
out in the darkness looks really cool and impactful. And sure it does. It does look cool.

20:34.960 --> 20:39.680
That's only a cool moment. And a cool moment with nothing holding it up feels hollow and unearned.

20:39.680 --> 20:45.440
And that is the entirety of Boba Fett. A series of unearned hollow cool moments. At this point

20:45.440 --> 20:51.360
the question is why do so many shows nowadays suffer from cool scene-itis? Well first of all

20:51.360 --> 20:55.760
it's entirely possible it's a product of diversity hiring. If you're picking people based on race or

20:55.760 --> 20:59.520
gender rather than skill you're going to end up with people who only know surface level stuff.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.840
And cool scene-itis is absolutely a product of a writer who doesn't know how to write but knows

21:03.840 --> 21:07.520
just enough to know that something should look cool. But of course we don't know if the writers

21:07.520 --> 21:12.480
were diversity hires. It could be just that they're bad at writing. But even then same thing applies.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.720
Secondly corporate greed is a factor. Regardless of how you feel about the Marvel films they spent

21:16.720 --> 21:21.280
a decade building up to the final confrontation with Thanos and that slow burn drastically helped

21:21.280 --> 21:25.440
the series. Compare that with the DC universe which crashed and burned right out the fucking

21:25.440 --> 21:30.480
gate by moving too fast with their own overlapping plot arcs. The Mandalorian season 2 finished up

21:30.480 --> 21:34.960
the Baby Yoda plot line as well as having the final confrontation with Moff Gideon which really

21:34.960 --> 21:39.520
should have been the series finale years down the road because they didn't have the patience for a

21:39.520 --> 21:44.160
slow burn and subsequent Mandalorian storylines are going to suffer for it. The way they hamfistedly

21:44.160 --> 21:48.800
brought back Baby Yoda for the Mando scenes in Boba Fett already shows that to be the case.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.960
And finally I think it's because prog writers truly believe that shoehorning in their politics

21:52.960 --> 21:58.160
or if they don't or can't do that shoehorning in representation replaces the character development

21:58.160 --> 22:03.280
required for a cool scene to actually be earned. I'll use Star Trek Discovery as the example this

22:03.280 --> 22:09.840
time. Seasons 3 and 4 have an ongoing story arc involving a non-binary human and a trans man trill.

22:09.840 --> 22:14.080
For clarification's sake the non-binary person is biologically female and being a trans man means

22:14.080 --> 22:18.880
transitioning from female to male. These characters have big moments in Discovery but they feel hollow

22:18.880 --> 22:22.640
because rather than having big character scenes that set them up their characterization is

22:22.640 --> 22:27.040
replaced with representation. I paid attention as best I could and the only thing I know about

22:27.040 --> 22:31.520
Adira aside from the fact that they're non-binary is that they have low self-esteem and I know

22:31.520 --> 22:35.200
absolutely nothing about Grey except that they're trans and they also have their consciousness

22:35.200 --> 22:39.760
transferred into a robot body and at that point are they even trans anymore? The robot body uses

22:39.760 --> 22:44.000
biotech to be identical to a human one so surely they just make it a male body and call it a day

22:44.000 --> 22:49.200
right? My point is these characters have climactic scenes that feel unearned because the meat and

22:49.200 --> 22:53.760
potatoes writing that should build up to those scenes instead revolves around their identity

22:53.760 --> 22:56.880
and their romantic relationship to the point that they almost feel like they're in a completely

22:56.880 --> 23:01.680
different universe than the rest of the show. The problem here is a character saying I'm non-binary

23:26.880 --> 23:36.480
or her so I would prefer they or them from now on. Yeah that counts as only the shallowest

23:36.480 --> 23:41.600
character development and does nothing towards building some kind of a climax but to a progressive

23:41.600 --> 23:45.120
writer whose biggest influence is Tumblr fan fiction it's probably the only way to write

23:45.120 --> 23:49.520
that they've ever known. The book of Bubba Fett wasn't nearly as bad as Discovery sure but every

23:49.520 --> 23:54.640
time the mod gang was on screen I just wanted to groan. This is Tumblr fan fiction pure and simple.

23:54.640 --> 23:58.400
The real Bubba Fett would have shot them in cold blood the first time they mouthed off to him.

23:58.400 --> 24:03.680
And so that was the book of Bubba Fett. A string of cool unearned scenes held together by focusing

24:03.680 --> 24:06.960
on literally everybody else but the titular character and the few times that he actually

24:06.960 --> 24:11.280
gets the spotlight it's nothing like established lore and those changes go completely unexplained.

24:11.280 --> 24:17.280
Even the actor who played him ultimately agreed. I was hoping not to say as much as I have already

24:17.280 --> 24:22.640
in the first two episodes. I speak far too much in fact in the beginning I was trying to get

24:22.720 --> 24:29.200
pass my lines on to Ming Na and I was like excuse me director I really feel that Ming

24:29.200 --> 24:36.320
Na should say these lines because I want to stay mysterious I want to stay quiet.

24:36.320 --> 24:40.400
At some point this has to stop right? They can't keep dumping loads of money into a fire pit

24:40.400 --> 24:44.880
forever right? Like there has to be a breaking point. There's only so much subverted flaming

24:44.880 --> 24:48.880
garbage these people can pump out before it begins to bankrupt these companies. I didn't pay for this

24:48.880 --> 24:53.600
shit. I got it courtesy of the pirate bay and man oh man do not shell out a single dime for it

24:53.600 --> 24:57.600
ain't worth it. It's like I said during the Lord of the Rings video this stuff only has

24:57.600 --> 25:01.360
worth when youtubers make content out of it. There's nothing else in here that's of value.

25:01.360 --> 25:07.840
Thank you.

25:07.840 --> 25:22.800
So the Wookie gets a melon and weed though.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.000
Here's something you want to share.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.400
What happened? Nothing Link we were just about to have a feast.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.960
Great!
