0	3520	All right, now that the book of Bubba Fett is over, let me give you my take on it.
3520	4880	It was awful, thanks for watching!
5840	10160	Right, that's not going to hit the eight minute minimum for full monetization on YouTube, is it?
10160	12480	Naomi and I have had a ritual now for a few years.
12480	16160	Every Thursday morning we gather up all the episodes of the various shows that we're
16160	20800	currently watching, make a big breakfast and have coffee, and lounge about for several hours and
20800	26080	play catch-up. We do this with both old shows that Naomi's never seen that I can rewatch with her,
26080	29120	as well as new shows that have new episodes coming out every week.
29120	32000	Most recently we've done this with Twin Peaks, both old and new,
32000	35760	Star Trek, both old and new, Attack on Titan, and The Mandalorian.
35760	40720	The Mandalorian is a pretty interesting show, all things considered. Let's see if I can describe how.
40720	46000	When Disney bought Lucasfilm, something like 50 years of expanded universe canon was wiped out.
46000	51120	As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
51120	54720	Disney announced that in order to make things less restrictive for their writers,
54720	59120	they weren't going to completely follow the EU canon. Where Luke gets with Mara Jade,
59120	64240	and Admiral Thrawn is going around being badass, and the Yuuzhan Vong invade, and Han Solo's son
64240	68720	Jason Solo becomes Darth Katius and is killed by his twin sister. No, I'm not worried about
68720	72480	spoilers of decades old stories that are officially non-canon now, as cool as they are.
72480	76160	And hey, you know what? I get it. How much of a surprise would it have been, and how
76160	80800	restrictive for the creators, if episode 7 was about Admiral Thrawn, episode 8 about the Vong,
80800	85840	and episode 9 about Darth Katius? Sometimes you just need room for new stories. I don't like this
85840	90720	whole wipe the slate clean tendency, when you should be cultivating properties, not destroying
90720	99360	them. But at the very least, Disney didn't wipe any mainline movies or whatever, so there's that.
99360	103280	Therefore, after Disney took control of Star Wars, the new canon looks something like this.
103280	108320	The prequel trilogy from 1999-2005, set during the first half of Anakin Skywalker's life.
108320	114800	The original trilogy from 1977-1983, set 20 years later. And the Clone Wars TV series. No,
114800	119920	not the good Tartovsky one, that was overwritten by the shittier CG version. Everything else was
119920	125760	made non-canon, and placed under the label of Star Wars Legends. From garbage-tier stuff like
125760	130000	the courtship of Princess Leia, to the story of the founding of the Rebellion from The Force
130000	134800	Unleashed, it was all rendered moot. Future Disney-owned outings would properly tell the
134800	139440	story of Princess Leia's romance, or how the Rebellion symbol came to be, thank you very much.
139440	144400	While some Legends characters would later return, reimagined for the new lore, the only thing that
144400	149440	was considered foundational as far as Disney was concerned, is the two trilogies in the Clone Wars
149440	154080	series. Afterward, they began to add their own new entries, and boy were they shit. I've already
154080	158480	gone over the sequel trilogy in detail in a previous video, but even beyond them, Rogue One
158480	163760	was shit, Star Wars Rebels was shit, Solo was so shit it caused the cancellation of the upcoming
163760	169200	Boba Fett and Obi-Wan films. While mainline Star Wars turned itself into a public mockery,
169200	173440	at Disney immolating the property for short-term gain and destroying its legacy in the process,
173440	178240	a subtler, less bombastic, and far more interesting show quietly released, and that
178240	183440	show was The Mandalorian. The Mandalorian's first episode came out on November 12th, 2019,
183440	188240	a month before Star Wars Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker. And even though Episode IX was this
188240	192640	billion-dollar blockbuster, with constant advertising, and merch, and toys, this thing
192640	196400	was shoved everywhere you could fucking look, people really didn't like it. It made money,
196400	200240	yeah, but way less than it should have, especially considering its budget, and the story was
200240	206000	absolutely atrocious. But most importantly of all, it was completely upstaged and outshined by its
206000	210240	smaller, quieter brother, The Mandalorian. The Rise of Skywalker was this bombastic,
210240	214880	galaxy-spanning story about saving the universe from the first, uh, sorry, the final order now,
214880	219760	with huge space battles and thousands of star destroyers with Death Star cannons on them,
219760	223360	and there's a race against time to use an ancient Sith dagger to unlock a puzzle,
223360	226800	and there's the wreckage of the Death Star on Endor, and Emperor Palpatine returns as a
226800	230400	primordial Sith evil who's been alive for thousands of years, still not giving a shit
230400	235040	about spoilers, by the way, while The Mandalorian is a story about a bounty hunter who goes to the
235040	238960	seedy underbellies of planets to try and find work. The stakes are lower, and that's a good
238960	243120	thing. There's more room to breathe, there's more time for character development, there's no sensory
243120	247440	overload of a billion ships all firing at each other in a space battle to end all space battles,
247440	251360	at least until the next movie comes out. The Mandalorian knows when to have loud action,
251360	255760	and when to be quiet for a little while. Do you recall when Star Trek Picard was billed
255760	260560	as this quieter show about Picard in his old age, not getting into his own huge space fights,
260560	265280	but instead being involved in a smaller story around town? Which brings back Patrick Stewart,
265280	269760	as next-generation Captain Jean-Luc Picard embraces a more deliberate pace that matches
269760	275120	its 79-year-old star, finding Jean-Luc on his French vineyard as he spends time with his loyal
275120	280400	dog Number One. That means fewer space shootouts and more quiet introspection, and that's just how
280400	285280	the team behind Picard intended it. And then they turn Picard into a giant pile of space laser dog
285280	290800	shit. Well, The Mandalorian is actually for Star Wars, what Picard was advertised to be for Star
290800	294880	Trek. Another point in The Mandalorian's favor, which is equally important but a lot easier to
294880	298960	explain, is that in the timeline it takes place between the original and sequel trilogy. A lot of
298960	302800	extra Star Wars stuff takes place between the prequel trilogy and the original. The era of
302800	307600	The Rise of the Empire has been explored to death, but the time period between Luke and Rey is still
307600	311280	pretty sparse, even now, so it's refreshing to get another look at how The New Republic works,
311280	315920	or see the Empire in decline before the First Order shows up, especially from the point of view
315920	320240	of a character who is not aligned with either faction like The Mandalorian. Also, there's Baby
320240	324560	Yoda, which instantly became a meme, something that Disney was somehow not prepared for. So,
324560	329760	when Christmas Time 2019 came around, they had all of this worthless Episode 9 merch that nobody
329760	333840	wanted to buy, and they had to quickly rush out Baby Yoda branded stuff to meet the demand.
333840	339280	Check this out, this is The Mandalorian merch from 2019. Look at this shit, it's low quality stills
339280	343840	from the show printed onto shirts and mugs and phone cases. It looks like they quickly slapped
343840	349040	it together on cafe press. How is it that Disney thought this shit was going to go gangbusters,
349040	353440	but didn't even notice that the quiet little brother of Star Wars was calmly putting out a
353440	358640	money-making machine? The first season of The Mandalorian respects Star Wars lore while artfully
358640	362480	adding to it, positioning the Mandalorians as an order of people who are the mortal enemies
362480	366240	of the Jedi, and have used their mastery of technology and weaponry to counter the Jedi's
366240	370400	use of the Force. The Empire wants to experiment on Baby Yoda for some kind of Force-related
370400	373920	Metachlorian bullshit, the Mandalorian decides to rescue him, and the two of them go bopping
373920	378160	around the galaxy getting into trouble. There is an overarching plot, but each episode also functions
378160	381680	as a standalone, where the Mandalorian comes into town, takes a job, solves the problem,
381680	385760	and moves on. It's as much of a space western as Star Wars has ever been, and its simplicity works
385760	390000	wonders. Season two of The Mandalorian is where it starts going into the shitter, presumably
390000	393920	because at this point Disney noticed that they had tanked everything else Star Wars related,
393920	398160	and The Mandalorian was the only thing earning them both money and the love of their audiences.
398160	403280	The success of The Mandalorian season one, and the failure of both Solo and episodes eight and nine,
403280	408320	caused a massive reorientation in Disney's plan. The Bubba Fett and Obi-Wan movies became TV shows,
408320	412000	since people's attention has been shifting away from film and towards TV for over a decade now,
412000	416080	and season two of The Mandalorian became less about telling good stories like season one,
416080	420240	and more about setting up as many spin-off shows as possible. Bubba Fett shows up,
420240	424560	and his show is given that coveted post-credits scene at the end of season two. Ahsoka Tano makes
424560	428720	an appearance, and a full arc of the show exists solely to sideline The Mandalorian,
428720	433280	and serve as a backdoor pilot for her upcoming show. Rangers of the New Republic is also a
433280	437200	planned show, stemming from the recurring appearances of these guys. Basically, Disney
437200	440080	noticed that the only thing that was taken off that they had made was The Mandalorian,
440080	443840	so they hitched as many possible fucking things to it, guaranteeing that its own
443840	448160	momentum ground to a halt. I haven't even talked about the book of Bubba Fett yet,
448160	452000	and that's because you really do need to understand all of this stuff to know how much
452000	456960	of an unmitigated disaster it is. But now, we're here. Bubba Fett is an iconic Star Wars character,
456960	461360	but unlike the other iconic characters, he's a blank slate. Luke is young and naive, but
461360	465440	good-hearted. He confronts evil before he's ready, and he's scarred by it. He matures,
465440	469120	and conquers the enemy within and without. He's the hero. Han Solo is a bit more dirty,
469120	472400	he's in it for the money. He's not above underhanded tricks or scheming or stealing,
472400	475840	but when the chips are down, he'll do the right thing. Leia is the bureaucrat, trained in the
475840	479360	art of politics, but not accustomed to doing fighting herself, and she grows into a capable
479360	483600	military leader in her own right. Lando is the former scoundrel who goes straight. He now runs
483600	487680	a respectable business, but he can't quite shake his sketchy past. He's a smooth talker and deal
487680	492320	maker. Darth Vader is the quintessential villain, the tortured soul who regrets the mistakes of his
492320	496880	youth, but he's in too deep to quit now. Bubba Fett is the guy with the cool armor and the cool
496880	501120	ship, called Slave One even in the original canon, which Disney refuses to recognize ever
501120	509280	again, always referring to it as Bubba Fett's ship, or my ship now. And he does have a couple
509280	513040	of lines that make him sound like he's a ruthless dude, but most of the time he just stands in the
513040	517680	background looking cool, until he unceremoniously gets smacked in the back by Han Solo in episode
517680	522640	6, causing his jetpack to fuck up, sending him into the sarlacc pit. My point is, for some reason
522640	527440	that I think just boils down to the rule of cool, fans treated Bubba Fett like he was a main Star
527440	532240	Wars character, even though there wasn't really much to him. Even George Lucas was surprised that
532240	536240	he was so beloved, saying he wouldn't have killed him if he had known. In the case of
536240	541600	Bubba Fett's death, had I known he was going to turn into such a popular character, I probably
541600	547280	would have made a little bit more exciting. Bubba Fett was just another one of the minions,
547280	554320	another one of the bounty hunters and bad guys. But he became such a favorite of everybody,
554320	560720	he said for having such a small part, he had a very large presence. And now that his history
560720	566240	has been told in the first trilogy, you know, it makes it even more of a misstep that we wouldn't
566240	572320	make more out of the event of his defeat, because most people don't believe he died anyway. I'd
572320	576640	contemplate him putting that extra shot in where he climbs out of the hole, but you know, I figure
577440	581920	it doesn't quite fit in the end. It's because he first showed up in the Star Wars Holiday Special?
581920	586800	The Mandalorian Season 1 was Disney's way of making a Bubba Fett show without committing to it.
586800	590880	Din Djarin looks like Bubba Fett. He behaves like a reasonable extrapolation of Bubba Fett's
590880	594560	appearances from the original trilogy, and to a lesser extent his appearances as a child in
594560	599040	the Clone Wars series. This was Disney dipping their toes into the Bubba Fett waters, and because
599040	603600	it was extremely well received, they decided to fully lean into it. But in this case, fully lean
603600	607760	in means Disney sends their billion-dollar wrecking ball crashing through everything.
607760	611520	The Mandalorian Season 2 introduces Bubba Fett proper, looking for his armor,
611520	615600	which Din Djarin just so happens to have. Fett gets it back, then he tags along for the rest
615600	619680	of the season's adventures, before returning to Tatooine to take over Jabba the Hutt's now-vacant
619680	624480	throne as crime lord. And holy shit, in both Season 2 and Bubba Fett's own show, does Bubba
624480	628400	look ridiculous. He's just a fat old man wearing the armor of a character that should have died in
628400	632080	the Sarlacc pit. Look at him in Return of the Jedi. He's a thin dude. Now he's got a chest
632080	636960	that reeks of congested heart failure. His armor barely even hangs off of him. Like, okay, I get
636960	641520	it. You hired the Jango Fett actor, and he's a bit too old for the roll-down. Fine. You know what you
641520	646080	do? You scale the armor up and try to play it off, because keeping the armor tiny just makes him look
646080	650240	ridiculous. Here, watch, I'll fucking fix it myself. You just take the armor, make sure its
650240	655040	dimensions are locked into their current ratio, and just scale it up, make it a little bit bigger.
655040	659600	There. It doesn't look good, but it looks better. The book of Bubba Fett was given seven episodes
659600	664160	to cover the following. How Bubba Fett survived the Sarlacc pit. What he was doing between Return
664160	669360	of the Jedi and his appearance in The Mandalorian. A five-year span of time. Establish why he wants
669360	674320	to take over Jabba's throne, and make that desire link up properly with his actions and behaviors
674320	679200	during The Mandalorian Season 2, and then have him actually go on his own quest to do that.
679200	684320	That's a lot of story arcs to cram into seven episodes, seven hours of content, especially
684320	689120	considering that the second half of the show goes back to focus on Din Djarin again and not
689120	694400	Bubba Fett. And the show wraps up everything by the end of the season finale. The entire thing
694400	699040	feels rushed and half-baked. The book of Bubba Fett opens with telling the story of that five-year
699040	703680	gap, and it is a by-the-book hero journey. The descent into the underworld, the fundamental change
703680	708080	in the self, and the return to civilization with newfound knowledge. In this instance, Fett wakes
708080	712560	up inside of the Sarlacc pit in the middle of his own digestion, and he uses his armor's technology
712560	717360	to escape it. Once he escapes, he collapses. Jawa's scavenge his armor, and the Sand People nurse him
717360	722080	back to health, teaching him their ways of living. He becomes an honorary member of their tribe until
722080	726480	they're killed by a speeder bike gang, upon which he returns to civilization. It's the best part of
726480	730560	the show, and it mirrors other well-told tales. The hero suffers a tragedy and is thrust into
730560	734720	the unknown. They need to survive it, learn from it, and eventually master it. They grow and change
734720	738880	as a result. Eventually, the hero returns home, able to appreciate its comforts but irrevocably
738880	744240	changed. Hell, it's Luke's story from the original Star Wars. The problem is, the reason this story
744240	749040	archetype resonates with us, is because it also happens to us in real life. When you move out of
749040	752800	your parents' house for the first time, when you're responsible for getting yourself up to go to class
752800	756880	in university, when you're responsible for your own rent after getting your first real job, the
756880	761600	same process is happening. It's not nearly as traumatic, but the parallel is there. You start off
761600	766320	young, naive, secure at home, but that can't last forever. In order to truly grow up, you need to cut
766320	770160	yourself loose from your support system and contend with an unfamiliar world. And when this
770160	775200	happens in real life, it overwhelmingly happens to young people. It's for that reason that most
775200	780320	heroes in fiction who undertake this process are young too. The reason the hero's journey is a story
780320	785600	for the young, is because parts of human psychology undergo a crystallization process as we get older.
785600	790000	Barring a major transformative event, like a hugely traumatic experience or a spiritual
790000	794480	awakening or something, most adults don't go through this process the way that kids do, because
794480	798480	adults have already gone through it and they've already learned how to go through it. In other
798480	802880	words, when Boba Fett is swinging his gaffey stick with the Sand People, I knew what story the show
802880	807280	was trying to tell, and all I could really think was, he's already gone through this, when his father
807280	812400	was beheaded in front of him in episode two. There is no way what they've shown so far is as
812400	817280	transformative an event as losing a parent at a young age. After the obligatory slaughter of the
817280	821600	Sand People, which spurs Fett back to civilization, he goes looking for his armor, which is where the
821600	826480	events of Mandalorian season two happen. Fett tags along because that's the deal that Din Djarin cuts
826480	831120	with him for the return of his armor. After that, he decides to go back to Tatooine in his own show
831120	836000	to rule the planet, and I spent most of the time wondering, why? You've been all over the galaxy,
836000	840800	why do you want the throne of a backwater shithole? We're given exactly one line describing
840800	847840	his motivations and it is this, I'm gonna kill that bloated pig who double-crossed me, take his throne.
847840	858240	It's not even downstream of the tragic Sand People backstory we got earlier. Okay fine,
858240	862560	you want to be your own boss, but why Tatooine? Why crime? Boba Fett's not even much of a crime lord.
862560	866480	He's not nearly ruthless enough throughout his show to be effective at the job, which is even
866480	870880	weirder because ruthlessness was the only noticeable character trait Boba Fett originally had.
870880	874960	The real answer is because there wouldn't be a show otherwise. We need Jabba's palace and
874960	879840	Tatooine and Rancor's and Wookiees and the green pig guys and all the other Star Wars shit, so
879840	884720	why the fuck not? The show's meager present-day action is framed by the far more interesting
884720	889040	flashback sequences, but once those flashbacks have run their course, the show starts being
889040	893760	framed by cutaways to what Dinjarin is doing, how he's holding up without baby Yoda, what the other
893760	897680	Mandalorians are up to. Man, I thought this was a spin-off show, I thought season two would
897680	901840	introduce Boba Fett and then he'd go off onto a new adventure, but at this point the most interesting
901840	906160	parts of the show are the times when we cut back to The Mandalorian, and that's when I realized
906160	911600	this show, The Book of Boba Fett, was originally meant to be part of The Mandalorian. No, really!
911600	915920	The series was originally conceptualized as The Mandalorian season 2.5 according to those who
915920	920000	worked on it, and the production treated it as such. The first episode of The Book of Boba Fett
920000	924640	was referred to as 301, the way a third season's first episode would be according to normal TV
924640	929440	show convention. The music is more reminiscent of The Mandalorian than any other property,
944880	948960	and the ending title crawl featuring concept art is directly pulled from The Mandalorian.
948960	954080	The season's entire second half focuses more on The Mandalorian than Boba Fett, and the final shot
954080	958240	of the last episode is The Mandalorian flying off to have a new adventure. Imagine being one
958240	962560	of those die-hard fans of Boba Fett, waiting for decades for his own movie, his own show,
962560	966960	something, and this is what you get. He's turned into a side character in his own show,
966960	970800	he's nothing like he should have been, and the person who sidelines him is exactly what he
970800	975120	should have been like. The actual plot of the present time events of The Book of Boba Fett
975120	979680	is extremely paint by numbers. Boba Fett wants Jabba's throne. Jabba's cousins leave it to him
979680	983360	after a short confrontation because the CG to do those characters is expensive, but the reason they
983360	986880	give is because a new villainous group, the Pike Syndicate, is showing up on Tatooine to take over
986880	990400	instead. The Pikes are extremely ruthless and they've bullied the other crime lords into
990400	994160	submission, and of course it turns out in the end that they were also the ones who slaughtered Boba
994160	998400	Fett's sand people tribe, because why the fuck not. Boba Fett manages to recruit a ragtag group
998400	1001920	of people to fight with him, including Fennec Shand, a new character who's been in multiple
1001920	1007200	other Star Wars shows, bridging the lore gap between them. Two green pig guys who act as cannon
1007200	1011600	fodder and predictably die at the end. A Wookiee because do you remember Chewbacca from Star Wars?
1011680	1017040	And a biker gang. Except the bikers all drive on shiny futuristic Vespas and look like really
1017040	1021920	bad cyberpunk cosplay. These guys are easily the worst part of the show. Look at this chase scene,
1021920	1026560	it's fucking abysmal. Even my fat ass can run faster than these guys are going. They've got
1026560	1031040	all this tense music blaring but this is no forest of ender let me tell you. These dudes are totally
1031040	1034560	useless in a firefight too. They don't look like people who can shoot and they certainly don't act
1034560	1038640	like it. Nothing like a superfluous spin to increase your accuracy am I right? I'll try
1038640	1043920	spinning that's a good trick. Also what the fuck is that? Did you see that? Do you see this? You
1043920	1048800	can see inside the facade of the sets from this angle. How do you miss this? How do you not CG
1048800	1054320	this shit out? You guys spent 15 million dollars an episode on this and the city looks like the
1054320	1059040	inside of my shed out back. Anyway Din Djarin also comes back to help out and when the war comes,
1059040	1063440	Bubba Fett convinces the other crime lords and remain neutral while he and his like 10 guys
1063440	1067840	fight off the entire pike syndicate which is a deal they all promptly break. So it's Bubba Fett
1067840	1072480	and his 10 guys who fight off all the pikes and all the other syndicates and they just win. It's
1072480	1077200	laughable they even directly say it. Our forces are quietly patrolling the streets of the old city.
1078240	1084720	The pike syndicate has not yet arrived in numbers but the minute they do we will see them before
1084720	1090400	they see us. The Gamorran guards are posted in the Platoonian territory at the starport and will
1090400	1095920	alert us if any of the pike syndicate forces arrive. Chrisanton is in Trandoshan territory
1095920	1101280	keeping tabs on the streets of the municipality in front of city hall. Drash and Skad are with
1101280	1107040	the other mods keeping an eye on the workers district and the aquillish quarter. As you can see
1107600	1112960	all our flanks are covered nobody is sneaking up on us. They're literally putting one or two dudes
1112960	1117600	at each post. They're not a mafia, they're a club. They never credibly establish that anybody cares
1117600	1121360	about Bubba Fett's organization but we've got a rush to the final confrontation where Bubba Fett
1121360	1125600	manages to win because he pulls out his rancor. Okay yeah fair enough it's a cool sequence but
1125600	1130320	it's unearned and that's the entire show cool but unearned. The overall plot is a lot like
1130320	1135280	walking tall. Hero leaves civilization and learns new wisdom. Check. Hero returns home with newfound
1135280	1139760	perspective. Check. Hero discovers his home is now overrun with baddies in his absence and he sets
1139760	1144080	out to make things right. Check. Hero liberates the community and the townspeople spread rose
1144080	1148800	petals along his path when he walks. Check. But none of it is earned. The skeleton of a solid plot
1148800	1152240	is here. They never spend enough time developing any of the essential connections that would make
1152240	1155840	the plot actually work. They never show the people suffering under the heel of the pikes
1155840	1159760	or the hut cousins and they never show the people secretly crying out for Bubba Fett to save them.
1159760	1163920	In the absence of popularity they don't establish that Bubba Fett has the numbers or the power to
1163920	1168880	simply impose his will on the city. In fact they explicitly say he doesn't. I have plenty of
1168880	1174480	critters. What I'm short on is muscle. They don't even establish why Bubba Fett wants to do it,
1174480	1179040	not in any meaningful way. He just does it because Disney sees dollar signs. That's it.
1179040	1183360	The book of Bubba Fett suffers from cool scene-itis. The Rancor fighting the robot
1183360	1187920	scene was cool. Bubba Fett and Din Djarin fighting off wave after wave of gangsters was cool. The
1187920	1193600	train heist was cool. But none of these scenes are earned. You earn a bombastic action set piece by
1193600	1197840	giving your characters moments to breathe and develop. I'll give you two examples from the same
1197840	1202640	show even. Game of Thrones season two. The Battle of Backwater is a huge action set piece and it's
1202640	1206480	earned. It's slowly built up across the entire season. Characters are preparing for it and
1206480	1210320	reacting to it. There's ample character growth and we're invested in the battle when it finally
1210320	1214000	comes. It's not just that the action is cool. It's that we care about what happens to the people
1214000	1217920	who are in it. Contrast that with the final season of Game of Thrones where the forces of light
1217920	1221920	stupidly send out their Dothraki cavalry from their fortified position to attack the army of
1221920	1225920	the dead. Not because it makes any sense. Not because any named characters are at stake. And
1225920	1230800	not because we as the audience care. But because that visual of the wave of flaming swords blinking
1230800	1234960	out in the darkness looks really cool and impactful. And sure it does. It does look cool.
1234960	1239680	That's only a cool moment. And a cool moment with nothing holding it up feels hollow and unearned.
1239680	1245440	And that is the entirety of Boba Fett. A series of unearned hollow cool moments. At this point
1245440	1251360	the question is why do so many shows nowadays suffer from cool scene-itis? Well first of all
1251360	1255760	it's entirely possible it's a product of diversity hiring. If you're picking people based on race or
1255760	1259520	gender rather than skill you're going to end up with people who only know surface level stuff.
1259520	1263840	And cool scene-itis is absolutely a product of a writer who doesn't know how to write but knows
1263840	1267520	just enough to know that something should look cool. But of course we don't know if the writers
1267520	1272480	were diversity hires. It could be just that they're bad at writing. But even then same thing applies.
1272480	1276720	Secondly corporate greed is a factor. Regardless of how you feel about the Marvel films they spent
1276720	1281280	a decade building up to the final confrontation with Thanos and that slow burn drastically helped
1281280	1285440	the series. Compare that with the DC universe which crashed and burned right out the fucking
1285440	1290480	gate by moving too fast with their own overlapping plot arcs. The Mandalorian season 2 finished up
1290480	1294960	the Baby Yoda plot line as well as having the final confrontation with Moff Gideon which really
1294960	1299520	should have been the series finale years down the road because they didn't have the patience for a
1299520	1304160	slow burn and subsequent Mandalorian storylines are going to suffer for it. The way they hamfistedly
1304160	1308800	brought back Baby Yoda for the Mando scenes in Boba Fett already shows that to be the case.
1308800	1312960	And finally I think it's because prog writers truly believe that shoehorning in their politics
1312960	1318160	or if they don't or can't do that shoehorning in representation replaces the character development
1318160	1323280	required for a cool scene to actually be earned. I'll use Star Trek Discovery as the example this
1323280	1329840	time. Seasons 3 and 4 have an ongoing story arc involving a non-binary human and a trans man trill.
1329840	1334080	For clarification's sake the non-binary person is biologically female and being a trans man means
1334080	1338880	transitioning from female to male. These characters have big moments in Discovery but they feel hollow
1338880	1342640	because rather than having big character scenes that set them up their characterization is
1342640	1347040	replaced with representation. I paid attention as best I could and the only thing I know about
1347040	1351520	Adira aside from the fact that they're non-binary is that they have low self-esteem and I know
1351520	1355200	absolutely nothing about Grey except that they're trans and they also have their consciousness
1355200	1359760	transferred into a robot body and at that point are they even trans anymore? The robot body uses
1359760	1364000	biotech to be identical to a human one so surely they just make it a male body and call it a day
1364000	1369200	right? My point is these characters have climactic scenes that feel unearned because the meat and
1369200	1373760	potatoes writing that should build up to those scenes instead revolves around their identity
1373760	1376880	and their romantic relationship to the point that they almost feel like they're in a completely
1376880	1381680	different universe than the rest of the show. The problem here is a character saying I'm non-binary
1406880	1416480	or her so I would prefer they or them from now on. Yeah that counts as only the shallowest
1416480	1421600	character development and does nothing towards building some kind of a climax but to a progressive
1421600	1425120	writer whose biggest influence is Tumblr fan fiction it's probably the only way to write
1425120	1429520	that they've ever known. The book of Bubba Fett wasn't nearly as bad as Discovery sure but every
1429520	1434640	time the mod gang was on screen I just wanted to groan. This is Tumblr fan fiction pure and simple.
1434640	1438400	The real Bubba Fett would have shot them in cold blood the first time they mouthed off to him.
1438400	1443680	And so that was the book of Bubba Fett. A string of cool unearned scenes held together by focusing
1443680	1446960	on literally everybody else but the titular character and the few times that he actually
1446960	1451280	gets the spotlight it's nothing like established lore and those changes go completely unexplained.
1451280	1457280	Even the actor who played him ultimately agreed. I was hoping not to say as much as I have already
1457280	1462640	in the first two episodes. I speak far too much in fact in the beginning I was trying to get
1462720	1469200	pass my lines on to Ming Na and I was like excuse me director I really feel that Ming
1469200	1476320	Na should say these lines because I want to stay mysterious I want to stay quiet.
1476320	1480400	At some point this has to stop right? They can't keep dumping loads of money into a fire pit
1480400	1484880	forever right? Like there has to be a breaking point. There's only so much subverted flaming
1484880	1488880	garbage these people can pump out before it begins to bankrupt these companies. I didn't pay for this
1488880	1493600	shit. I got it courtesy of the pirate bay and man oh man do not shell out a single dime for it
1493600	1497600	ain't worth it. It's like I said during the Lord of the Rings video this stuff only has
1497600	1501360	worth when youtubers make content out of it. There's nothing else in here that's of value.
1501360	1507840	Thank you.
1507840	1522800	So the Wookie gets a melon and weed though.
1522800	1524000	Here's something you want to share.
1527840	1532400	What happened? Nothing Link we were just about to have a feast.
1532400	1536960	Great!
