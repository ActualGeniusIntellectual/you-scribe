1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
All right, now that the book of Bubba Fett is over, let me give you my take on it.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,880
It was awful, thanks for watching!

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,160
Right, that's not going to hit the eight minute minimum for full monetization on YouTube, is it?

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,480
Naomi and I have had a ritual now for a few years.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,160
Every Thursday morning we gather up all the episodes of the various shows that we're

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,800
currently watching, make a big breakfast and have coffee, and lounge about for several hours and

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,080
play catch-up. We do this with both old shows that Naomi's never seen that I can rewatch with her,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,120
as well as new shows that have new episodes coming out every week.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,000
Most recently we've done this with Twin Peaks, both old and new,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
Star Trek, both old and new, Attack on Titan, and The Mandalorian.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,720
The Mandalorian is a pretty interesting show, all things considered. Let's see if I can describe how.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,000
When Disney bought Lucasfilm, something like 50 years of expanded universe canon was wiped out.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,120
As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,720
Disney announced that in order to make things less restrictive for their writers,

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,120
they weren't going to completely follow the EU canon. Where Luke gets with Mara Jade,

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,240
and Admiral Thrawn is going around being badass, and the Yuuzhan Vong invade, and Han Solo's son

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,720
Jason Solo becomes Darth Katius and is killed by his twin sister. No, I'm not worried about

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,480
spoilers of decades old stories that are officially non-canon now, as cool as they are.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,160
And hey, you know what? I get it. How much of a surprise would it have been, and how

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,800
restrictive for the creators, if episode 7 was about Admiral Thrawn, episode 8 about the Vong,

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,840
and episode 9 about Darth Katius? Sometimes you just need room for new stories. I don't like this

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,720
whole wipe the slate clean tendency, when you should be cultivating properties, not destroying

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:39,360
them. But at the very least, Disney didn't wipe any mainline movies or whatever, so there's that.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
Therefore, after Disney took control of Star Wars, the new canon looks something like this.

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
The prequel trilogy from 1999-2005, set during the first half of Anakin Skywalker's life.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,800
The original trilogy from 1977-1983, set 20 years later. And the Clone Wars TV series. No,

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,920
not the good Tartovsky one, that was overwritten by the shittier CG version. Everything else was

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,760
made non-canon, and placed under the label of Star Wars Legends. From garbage-tier stuff like

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,000
the courtship of Princess Leia, to the story of the founding of the Rebellion from The Force

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Unleashed, it was all rendered moot. Future Disney-owned outings would properly tell the

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
story of Princess Leia's romance, or how the Rebellion symbol came to be, thank you very much.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,400
While some Legends characters would later return, reimagined for the new lore, the only thing that

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,440
was considered foundational as far as Disney was concerned, is the two trilogies in the Clone Wars

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,080
series. Afterward, they began to add their own new entries, and boy were they shit. I've already

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,480
gone over the sequel trilogy in detail in a previous video, but even beyond them, Rogue One

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,760
was shit, Star Wars Rebels was shit, Solo was so shit it caused the cancellation of the upcoming

37
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,200
Boba Fett and Obi-Wan films. While mainline Star Wars turned itself into a public mockery,

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
at Disney immolating the property for short-term gain and destroying its legacy in the process,

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,240
a subtler, less bombastic, and far more interesting show quietly released, and that

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,440
show was The Mandalorian. The Mandalorian's first episode came out on November 12th, 2019,

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,240
a month before Star Wars Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker. And even though Episode IX was this

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,640
billion-dollar blockbuster, with constant advertising, and merch, and toys, this thing

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
was shoved everywhere you could fucking look, people really didn't like it. It made money,

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,240
yeah, but way less than it should have, especially considering its budget, and the story was

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,000
absolutely atrocious. But most importantly of all, it was completely upstaged and outshined by its

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,240
smaller, quieter brother, The Mandalorian. The Rise of Skywalker was this bombastic,

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,880
galaxy-spanning story about saving the universe from the first, uh, sorry, the final order now,

48
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,760
with huge space battles and thousands of star destroyers with Death Star cannons on them,

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,360
and there's a race against time to use an ancient Sith dagger to unlock a puzzle,

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,800
and there's the wreckage of the Death Star on Endor, and Emperor Palpatine returns as a

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,400
primordial Sith evil who's been alive for thousands of years, still not giving a shit

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
about spoilers, by the way, while The Mandalorian is a story about a bounty hunter who goes to the

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,960
seedy underbellies of planets to try and find work. The stakes are lower, and that's a good

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,120
thing. There's more room to breathe, there's more time for character development, there's no sensory

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,440
overload of a billion ships all firing at each other in a space battle to end all space battles,

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,360
at least until the next movie comes out. The Mandalorian knows when to have loud action,

57
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,760
and when to be quiet for a little while. Do you recall when Star Trek Picard was billed

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,560
as this quieter show about Picard in his old age, not getting into his own huge space fights,

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,280
but instead being involved in a smaller story around town? Which brings back Patrick Stewart,

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,760
as next-generation Captain Jean-Luc Picard embraces a more deliberate pace that matches

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,120
its 79-year-old star, finding Jean-Luc on his French vineyard as he spends time with his loyal

62
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,400
dog Number One. That means fewer space shootouts and more quiet introspection, and that's just how

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,280
the team behind Picard intended it. And then they turn Picard into a giant pile of space laser dog

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,800
shit. Well, The Mandalorian is actually for Star Wars, what Picard was advertised to be for Star

65
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,880
Trek. Another point in The Mandalorian's favor, which is equally important but a lot easier to

66
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,960
explain, is that in the timeline it takes place between the original and sequel trilogy. A lot of

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,800
extra Star Wars stuff takes place between the prequel trilogy and the original. The era of

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
The Rise of the Empire has been explored to death, but the time period between Luke and Rey is still

69
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
pretty sparse, even now, so it's refreshing to get another look at how The New Republic works,

70
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,920
or see the Empire in decline before the First Order shows up, especially from the point of view

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,240
of a character who is not aligned with either faction like The Mandalorian. Also, there's Baby

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
Yoda, which instantly became a meme, something that Disney was somehow not prepared for. So,

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,760
when Christmas Time 2019 came around, they had all of this worthless Episode 9 merch that nobody

74
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,840
wanted to buy, and they had to quickly rush out Baby Yoda branded stuff to meet the demand.

75
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,280
Check this out, this is The Mandalorian merch from 2019. Look at this shit, it's low quality stills

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,840
from the show printed onto shirts and mugs and phone cases. It looks like they quickly slapped

77
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,040
it together on cafe press. How is it that Disney thought this shit was going to go gangbusters,

78
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,440
but didn't even notice that the quiet little brother of Star Wars was calmly putting out a

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,640
money-making machine? The first season of The Mandalorian respects Star Wars lore while artfully

80
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,480
adding to it, positioning the Mandalorians as an order of people who are the mortal enemies

81
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,240
of the Jedi, and have used their mastery of technology and weaponry to counter the Jedi's

82
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
use of the Force. The Empire wants to experiment on Baby Yoda for some kind of Force-related

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,920
Metachlorian bullshit, the Mandalorian decides to rescue him, and the two of them go bopping

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,160
around the galaxy getting into trouble. There is an overarching plot, but each episode also functions

85
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
as a standalone, where the Mandalorian comes into town, takes a job, solves the problem,

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,760
and moves on. It's as much of a space western as Star Wars has ever been, and its simplicity works

87
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,000
wonders. Season two of The Mandalorian is where it starts going into the shitter, presumably

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,920
because at this point Disney noticed that they had tanked everything else Star Wars related,

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,160
and The Mandalorian was the only thing earning them both money and the love of their audiences.

90
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,280
The success of The Mandalorian season one, and the failure of both Solo and episodes eight and nine,

91
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,320
caused a massive reorientation in Disney's plan. The Bubba Fett and Obi-Wan movies became TV shows,

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,000
since people's attention has been shifting away from film and towards TV for over a decade now,

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,080
and season two of The Mandalorian became less about telling good stories like season one,

94
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,240
and more about setting up as many spin-off shows as possible. Bubba Fett shows up,

95
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
and his show is given that coveted post-credits scene at the end of season two. Ahsoka Tano makes

96
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
an appearance, and a full arc of the show exists solely to sideline The Mandalorian,

97
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
and serve as a backdoor pilot for her upcoming show. Rangers of the New Republic is also a

98
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,200
planned show, stemming from the recurring appearances of these guys. Basically, Disney

99
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,080
noticed that the only thing that was taken off that they had made was The Mandalorian,

100
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,840
so they hitched as many possible fucking things to it, guaranteeing that its own

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
momentum ground to a halt. I haven't even talked about the book of Bubba Fett yet,

102
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,000
and that's because you really do need to understand all of this stuff to know how much

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,960
of an unmitigated disaster it is. But now, we're here. Bubba Fett is an iconic Star Wars character,

104
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,360
but unlike the other iconic characters, he's a blank slate. Luke is young and naive, but

105
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,440
good-hearted. He confronts evil before he's ready, and he's scarred by it. He matures,

106
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,120
and conquers the enemy within and without. He's the hero. Han Solo is a bit more dirty,

107
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,400
he's in it for the money. He's not above underhanded tricks or scheming or stealing,

108
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,840
but when the chips are down, he'll do the right thing. Leia is the bureaucrat, trained in the

109
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,360
art of politics, but not accustomed to doing fighting herself, and she grows into a capable

110
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,600
military leader in her own right. Lando is the former scoundrel who goes straight. He now runs

111
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,680
a respectable business, but he can't quite shake his sketchy past. He's a smooth talker and deal

112
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,320
maker. Darth Vader is the quintessential villain, the tortured soul who regrets the mistakes of his

113
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,880
youth, but he's in too deep to quit now. Bubba Fett is the guy with the cool armor and the cool

114
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,120
ship, called Slave One even in the original canon, which Disney refuses to recognize ever

115
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:29,280
again, always referring to it as Bubba Fett's ship, or my ship now. And he does have a couple

116
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,040
of lines that make him sound like he's a ruthless dude, but most of the time he just stands in the

117
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,680
background looking cool, until he unceremoniously gets smacked in the back by Han Solo in episode

118
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,640
6, causing his jetpack to fuck up, sending him into the sarlacc pit. My point is, for some reason

119
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,440
that I think just boils down to the rule of cool, fans treated Bubba Fett like he was a main Star

120
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Wars character, even though there wasn't really much to him. Even George Lucas was surprised that

121
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
he was so beloved, saying he wouldn't have killed him if he had known. In the case of

122
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,600
Bubba Fett's death, had I known he was going to turn into such a popular character, I probably

123
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,280
would have made a little bit more exciting. Bubba Fett was just another one of the minions,

124
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,320
another one of the bounty hunters and bad guys. But he became such a favorite of everybody,

125
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,720
he said for having such a small part, he had a very large presence. And now that his history

126
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,240
has been told in the first trilogy, you know, it makes it even more of a misstep that we wouldn't

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,320
make more out of the event of his defeat, because most people don't believe he died anyway. I'd

128
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,640
contemplate him putting that extra shot in where he climbs out of the hole, but you know, I figure

129
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,920
it doesn't quite fit in the end. It's because he first showed up in the Star Wars Holiday Special?

130
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,800
The Mandalorian Season 1 was Disney's way of making a Bubba Fett show without committing to it.

131
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,880
Din Djarin looks like Bubba Fett. He behaves like a reasonable extrapolation of Bubba Fett's

132
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
appearances from the original trilogy, and to a lesser extent his appearances as a child in

133
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,040
the Clone Wars series. This was Disney dipping their toes into the Bubba Fett waters, and because

134
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,600
it was extremely well received, they decided to fully lean into it. But in this case, fully lean

135
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,760
in means Disney sends their billion-dollar wrecking ball crashing through everything.

136
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,520
The Mandalorian Season 2 introduces Bubba Fett proper, looking for his armor,

137
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,600
which Din Djarin just so happens to have. Fett gets it back, then he tags along for the rest

138
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,680
of the season's adventures, before returning to Tatooine to take over Jabba the Hutt's now-vacant

139
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,480
throne as crime lord. And holy shit, in both Season 2 and Bubba Fett's own show, does Bubba

140
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,400
look ridiculous. He's just a fat old man wearing the armor of a character that should have died in

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,080
the Sarlacc pit. Look at him in Return of the Jedi. He's a thin dude. Now he's got a chest

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,960
that reeks of congested heart failure. His armor barely even hangs off of him. Like, okay, I get

143
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,520
it. You hired the Jango Fett actor, and he's a bit too old for the roll-down. Fine. You know what you

144
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,080
do? You scale the armor up and try to play it off, because keeping the armor tiny just makes him look

145
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,240
ridiculous. Here, watch, I'll fucking fix it myself. You just take the armor, make sure its

146
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,040
dimensions are locked into their current ratio, and just scale it up, make it a little bit bigger.

147
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,600
There. It doesn't look good, but it looks better. The book of Bubba Fett was given seven episodes

148
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,160
to cover the following. How Bubba Fett survived the Sarlacc pit. What he was doing between Return

149
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,360
of the Jedi and his appearance in The Mandalorian. A five-year span of time. Establish why he wants

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,320
to take over Jabba's throne, and make that desire link up properly with his actions and behaviors

151
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,200
during The Mandalorian Season 2, and then have him actually go on his own quest to do that.

152
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,320
That's a lot of story arcs to cram into seven episodes, seven hours of content, especially

153
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,120
considering that the second half of the show goes back to focus on Din Djarin again and not

154
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,400
Bubba Fett. And the show wraps up everything by the end of the season finale. The entire thing

155
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,040
feels rushed and half-baked. The book of Bubba Fett opens with telling the story of that five-year

156
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,680
gap, and it is a by-the-book hero journey. The descent into the underworld, the fundamental change

157
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,080
in the self, and the return to civilization with newfound knowledge. In this instance, Fett wakes

158
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,560
up inside of the Sarlacc pit in the middle of his own digestion, and he uses his armor's technology

159
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,360
to escape it. Once he escapes, he collapses. Jawa's scavenge his armor, and the Sand People nurse him

160
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,080
back to health, teaching him their ways of living. He becomes an honorary member of their tribe until

161
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,480
they're killed by a speeder bike gang, upon which he returns to civilization. It's the best part of

162
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,560
the show, and it mirrors other well-told tales. The hero suffers a tragedy and is thrust into

163
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,720
the unknown. They need to survive it, learn from it, and eventually master it. They grow and change

164
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,880
as a result. Eventually, the hero returns home, able to appreciate its comforts but irrevocably

165
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,240
changed. Hell, it's Luke's story from the original Star Wars. The problem is, the reason this story

166
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,040
archetype resonates with us, is because it also happens to us in real life. When you move out of

167
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
your parents' house for the first time, when you're responsible for getting yourself up to go to class

168
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
in university, when you're responsible for your own rent after getting your first real job, the

169
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,600
same process is happening. It's not nearly as traumatic, but the parallel is there. You start off

170
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,320
young, naive, secure at home, but that can't last forever. In order to truly grow up, you need to cut

171
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
yourself loose from your support system and contend with an unfamiliar world. And when this

172
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,200
happens in real life, it overwhelmingly happens to young people. It's for that reason that most

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,320
heroes in fiction who undertake this process are young too. The reason the hero's journey is a story

174
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,600
for the young, is because parts of human psychology undergo a crystallization process as we get older.

175
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Barring a major transformative event, like a hugely traumatic experience or a spiritual

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
awakening or something, most adults don't go through this process the way that kids do, because

177
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
adults have already gone through it and they've already learned how to go through it. In other

178
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,880
words, when Boba Fett is swinging his gaffey stick with the Sand People, I knew what story the show

179
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,280
was trying to tell, and all I could really think was, he's already gone through this, when his father

180
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,400
was beheaded in front of him in episode two. There is no way what they've shown so far is as

181
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,280
transformative an event as losing a parent at a young age. After the obligatory slaughter of the

182
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,600
Sand People, which spurs Fett back to civilization, he goes looking for his armor, which is where the

183
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,480
events of Mandalorian season two happen. Fett tags along because that's the deal that Din Djarin cuts

184
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,120
with him for the return of his armor. After that, he decides to go back to Tatooine in his own show

185
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,000
to rule the planet, and I spent most of the time wondering, why? You've been all over the galaxy,

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,800
why do you want the throne of a backwater shithole? We're given exactly one line describing

187
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,840
his motivations and it is this, I'm gonna kill that bloated pig who double-crossed me, take his throne.

188
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:18,240
It's not even downstream of the tragic Sand People backstory we got earlier. Okay fine,

189
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,560
you want to be your own boss, but why Tatooine? Why crime? Boba Fett's not even much of a crime lord.

190
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,480
He's not nearly ruthless enough throughout his show to be effective at the job, which is even

191
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,880
weirder because ruthlessness was the only noticeable character trait Boba Fett originally had.

192
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,960
The real answer is because there wouldn't be a show otherwise. We need Jabba's palace and

193
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,840
Tatooine and Rancor's and Wookiees and the green pig guys and all the other Star Wars shit, so

194
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,720
why the fuck not? The show's meager present-day action is framed by the far more interesting

195
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
flashback sequences, but once those flashbacks have run their course, the show starts being

196
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,760
framed by cutaways to what Dinjarin is doing, how he's holding up without baby Yoda, what the other

197
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,680
Mandalorians are up to. Man, I thought this was a spin-off show, I thought season two would

198
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,840
introduce Boba Fett and then he'd go off onto a new adventure, but at this point the most interesting

199
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,160
parts of the show are the times when we cut back to The Mandalorian, and that's when I realized

200
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,600
this show, The Book of Boba Fett, was originally meant to be part of The Mandalorian. No, really!

201
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
The series was originally conceptualized as The Mandalorian season 2.5 according to those who

202
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,000
worked on it, and the production treated it as such. The first episode of The Book of Boba Fett

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,640
was referred to as 301, the way a third season's first episode would be according to normal TV

204
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,440
show convention. The music is more reminiscent of The Mandalorian than any other property,

205
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,960
and the ending title crawl featuring concept art is directly pulled from The Mandalorian.

206
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,080
The season's entire second half focuses more on The Mandalorian than Boba Fett, and the final shot

207
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,240
of the last episode is The Mandalorian flying off to have a new adventure. Imagine being one

208
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,560
of those die-hard fans of Boba Fett, waiting for decades for his own movie, his own show,

209
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,960
something, and this is what you get. He's turned into a side character in his own show,

210
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,800
he's nothing like he should have been, and the person who sidelines him is exactly what he

211
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,120
should have been like. The actual plot of the present time events of The Book of Boba Fett

212
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,680
is extremely paint by numbers. Boba Fett wants Jabba's throne. Jabba's cousins leave it to him

213
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,360
after a short confrontation because the CG to do those characters is expensive, but the reason they

214
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,880
give is because a new villainous group, the Pike Syndicate, is showing up on Tatooine to take over

215
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,400
instead. The Pikes are extremely ruthless and they've bullied the other crime lords into

216
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,160
submission, and of course it turns out in the end that they were also the ones who slaughtered Boba

217
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,400
Fett's sand people tribe, because why the fuck not. Boba Fett manages to recruit a ragtag group

218
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,920
of people to fight with him, including Fennec Shand, a new character who's been in multiple

219
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,200
other Star Wars shows, bridging the lore gap between them. Two green pig guys who act as cannon

220
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,600
fodder and predictably die at the end. A Wookiee because do you remember Chewbacca from Star Wars?

221
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,040
And a biker gang. Except the bikers all drive on shiny futuristic Vespas and look like really

222
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
bad cyberpunk cosplay. These guys are easily the worst part of the show. Look at this chase scene,

223
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,560
it's fucking abysmal. Even my fat ass can run faster than these guys are going. They've got

224
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,040
all this tense music blaring but this is no forest of ender let me tell you. These dudes are totally

225
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,560
useless in a firefight too. They don't look like people who can shoot and they certainly don't act

226
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,640
like it. Nothing like a superfluous spin to increase your accuracy am I right? I'll try

227
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,920
spinning that's a good trick. Also what the fuck is that? Did you see that? Do you see this? You

228
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,800
can see inside the facade of the sets from this angle. How do you miss this? How do you not CG

229
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,320
this shit out? You guys spent 15 million dollars an episode on this and the city looks like the

230
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,040
inside of my shed out back. Anyway Din Djarin also comes back to help out and when the war comes,

231
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,440
Bubba Fett convinces the other crime lords and remain neutral while he and his like 10 guys

232
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,840
fight off the entire pike syndicate which is a deal they all promptly break. So it's Bubba Fett

233
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,480
and his 10 guys who fight off all the pikes and all the other syndicates and they just win. It's

234
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,200
laughable they even directly say it. Our forces are quietly patrolling the streets of the old city.

235
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,720
The pike syndicate has not yet arrived in numbers but the minute they do we will see them before

236
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,400
they see us. The Gamorran guards are posted in the Platoonian territory at the starport and will

237
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,920
alert us if any of the pike syndicate forces arrive. Chrisanton is in Trandoshan territory

238
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,280
keeping tabs on the streets of the municipality in front of city hall. Drash and Skad are with

239
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,040
the other mods keeping an eye on the workers district and the aquillish quarter. As you can see

240
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,960
all our flanks are covered nobody is sneaking up on us. They're literally putting one or two dudes

241
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,600
at each post. They're not a mafia, they're a club. They never credibly establish that anybody cares

242
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,360
about Bubba Fett's organization but we've got a rush to the final confrontation where Bubba Fett

243
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,600
manages to win because he pulls out his rancor. Okay yeah fair enough it's a cool sequence but

244
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,320
it's unearned and that's the entire show cool but unearned. The overall plot is a lot like

245
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,280
walking tall. Hero leaves civilization and learns new wisdom. Check. Hero returns home with newfound

246
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,760
perspective. Check. Hero discovers his home is now overrun with baddies in his absence and he sets

247
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,080
out to make things right. Check. Hero liberates the community and the townspeople spread rose

248
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,800
petals along his path when he walks. Check. But none of it is earned. The skeleton of a solid plot

249
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,240
is here. They never spend enough time developing any of the essential connections that would make

250
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,840
the plot actually work. They never show the people suffering under the heel of the pikes

251
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,760
or the hut cousins and they never show the people secretly crying out for Bubba Fett to save them.

252
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,920
In the absence of popularity they don't establish that Bubba Fett has the numbers or the power to

253
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,880
simply impose his will on the city. In fact they explicitly say he doesn't. I have plenty of

254
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,480
critters. What I'm short on is muscle. They don't even establish why Bubba Fett wants to do it,

255
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,040
not in any meaningful way. He just does it because Disney sees dollar signs. That's it.

256
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,360
The book of Bubba Fett suffers from cool scene-itis. The Rancor fighting the robot

257
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,920
scene was cool. Bubba Fett and Din Djarin fighting off wave after wave of gangsters was cool. The

258
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,600
train heist was cool. But none of these scenes are earned. You earn a bombastic action set piece by

259
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,840
giving your characters moments to breathe and develop. I'll give you two examples from the same

260
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,640
show even. Game of Thrones season two. The Battle of Backwater is a huge action set piece and it's

261
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
earned. It's slowly built up across the entire season. Characters are preparing for it and

262
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,320
reacting to it. There's ample character growth and we're invested in the battle when it finally

263
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,000
comes. It's not just that the action is cool. It's that we care about what happens to the people

264
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,920
who are in it. Contrast that with the final season of Game of Thrones where the forces of light

265
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,920
stupidly send out their Dothraki cavalry from their fortified position to attack the army of

266
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,920
the dead. Not because it makes any sense. Not because any named characters are at stake. And

267
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,800
not because we as the audience care. But because that visual of the wave of flaming swords blinking

268
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,960
out in the darkness looks really cool and impactful. And sure it does. It does look cool.

269
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,680
That's only a cool moment. And a cool moment with nothing holding it up feels hollow and unearned.

270
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,440
And that is the entirety of Boba Fett. A series of unearned hollow cool moments. At this point

271
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,360
the question is why do so many shows nowadays suffer from cool scene-itis? Well first of all

272
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,760
it's entirely possible it's a product of diversity hiring. If you're picking people based on race or

273
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,520
gender rather than skill you're going to end up with people who only know surface level stuff.

274
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
And cool scene-itis is absolutely a product of a writer who doesn't know how to write but knows

275
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,520
just enough to know that something should look cool. But of course we don't know if the writers

276
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,480
were diversity hires. It could be just that they're bad at writing. But even then same thing applies.

277
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Secondly corporate greed is a factor. Regardless of how you feel about the Marvel films they spent

278
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,280
a decade building up to the final confrontation with Thanos and that slow burn drastically helped

279
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,440
the series. Compare that with the DC universe which crashed and burned right out the fucking

280
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,480
gate by moving too fast with their own overlapping plot arcs. The Mandalorian season 2 finished up

281
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,960
the Baby Yoda plot line as well as having the final confrontation with Moff Gideon which really

282
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,520
should have been the series finale years down the road because they didn't have the patience for a

283
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,160
slow burn and subsequent Mandalorian storylines are going to suffer for it. The way they hamfistedly

284
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,800
brought back Baby Yoda for the Mando scenes in Boba Fett already shows that to be the case.

285
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,960
And finally I think it's because prog writers truly believe that shoehorning in their politics

286
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,160
or if they don't or can't do that shoehorning in representation replaces the character development

287
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,280
required for a cool scene to actually be earned. I'll use Star Trek Discovery as the example this

288
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,840
time. Seasons 3 and 4 have an ongoing story arc involving a non-binary human and a trans man trill.

289
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,080
For clarification's sake the non-binary person is biologically female and being a trans man means

290
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,880
transitioning from female to male. These characters have big moments in Discovery but they feel hollow

291
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,640
because rather than having big character scenes that set them up their characterization is

292
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,040
replaced with representation. I paid attention as best I could and the only thing I know about

293
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,520
Adira aside from the fact that they're non-binary is that they have low self-esteem and I know

294
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,200
absolutely nothing about Grey except that they're trans and they also have their consciousness

295
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,760
transferred into a robot body and at that point are they even trans anymore? The robot body uses

296
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,000
biotech to be identical to a human one so surely they just make it a male body and call it a day

297
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,200
right? My point is these characters have climactic scenes that feel unearned because the meat and

298
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,760
potatoes writing that should build up to those scenes instead revolves around their identity

299
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
and their romantic relationship to the point that they almost feel like they're in a completely

300
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,680
different universe than the rest of the show. The problem here is a character saying I'm non-binary

301
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:36,480
or her so I would prefer they or them from now on. Yeah that counts as only the shallowest

302
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,600
character development and does nothing towards building some kind of a climax but to a progressive

303
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,120
writer whose biggest influence is Tumblr fan fiction it's probably the only way to write

304
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,520
that they've ever known. The book of Bubba Fett wasn't nearly as bad as Discovery sure but every

305
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,640
time the mod gang was on screen I just wanted to groan. This is Tumblr fan fiction pure and simple.

306
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,400
The real Bubba Fett would have shot them in cold blood the first time they mouthed off to him.

307
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,680
And so that was the book of Bubba Fett. A string of cool unearned scenes held together by focusing

308
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,960
on literally everybody else but the titular character and the few times that he actually

309
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,280
gets the spotlight it's nothing like established lore and those changes go completely unexplained.

310
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Even the actor who played him ultimately agreed. I was hoping not to say as much as I have already

311
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,640
in the first two episodes. I speak far too much in fact in the beginning I was trying to get

312
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,200
pass my lines on to Ming Na and I was like excuse me director I really feel that Ming

313
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:36,320
Na should say these lines because I want to stay mysterious I want to stay quiet.

314
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,400
At some point this has to stop right? They can't keep dumping loads of money into a fire pit

315
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,880
forever right? Like there has to be a breaking point. There's only so much subverted flaming

316
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,880
garbage these people can pump out before it begins to bankrupt these companies. I didn't pay for this

317
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,600
shit. I got it courtesy of the pirate bay and man oh man do not shell out a single dime for it

318
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
ain't worth it. It's like I said during the Lord of the Rings video this stuff only has

319
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,360
worth when youtubers make content out of it. There's nothing else in here that's of value.

320
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,840
Thank you.

321
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:22,800
So the Wookie gets a melon and weed though.

322
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,000
Here's something you want to share.

323
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,400
What happened? Nothing Link we were just about to have a feast.

324
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,960
Great!
