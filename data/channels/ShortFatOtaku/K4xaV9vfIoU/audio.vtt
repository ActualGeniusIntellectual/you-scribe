00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Hello, it is TikTok Tuesday time once again. I'm recording this on Sunday, though. By the time you

00:06.640 --> 00:10.480
guys watch it, I'll be out of town. I'm going away for a few days. Anyway, let's see what we're

00:10.480 --> 00:16.160
watching today. Thanks, guys. A quick reminder that capitalism offers us zero incentives to

00:16.160 --> 00:21.360
actually be a worker, yet is a system that requires the majority of us to be workers.

00:21.360 --> 00:28.640
Oh, my God. Why do we have to start off with this one? Why? I blame you guys. Why? Capitalism

00:28.640 --> 00:33.040
offers you no incentive. It's called your pay. And you know what? At this point, capitalism

00:33.040 --> 00:37.120
doesn't require the majority of you to be workers. We have automation for that. Are you in the fields

00:37.120 --> 00:42.160
like plowing and making food? No, you're sitting around. The gall of these people, dude. They're

00:42.160 --> 00:46.640
like, capitalism requires us all to be workers. Meanwhile, you're sitting around on EBT. Get the

00:46.640 --> 00:51.760
fuck out of here. And before you tell me that the need for survival is the incentive that is given

00:51.760 --> 00:56.560
to workers to keep on going to work because we need that paycheck to survive under capitalism,

00:57.280 --> 01:01.520
might I just tell you that it's not that good of an incentive when most of us who work still can't

01:01.520 --> 01:05.360
survive? Yeah, dude, you look like you're in a third world country. Oh, man, it's so terrible

01:05.360 --> 01:09.760
for you. You're not surviving? What the fuck? Am I listening to a ghost? Like, oh, yeah,

01:09.760 --> 01:14.240
go to work so that you can get health insurance, but that health insurance won't actually cover

01:14.240 --> 01:18.560
everything that you need. Or like, go to work so that you can end up having disposable income.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.040
Ha, just kidding. All of that income will then be going to your landlord. You do realize that

01:23.040 --> 01:28.240
all the Uber eats, that's the disposable income, right? All the Netflix, all the pay as you go

01:28.240 --> 01:32.560
services, like everything that you're spending your money on. And I think that that's why most

01:32.560 --> 01:38.400
of us workers intuitively understand that capitalism is a system that monopolizes freedom.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.040
Monopolizes? So the capitalists have all the freedom in the world, they have disposable

01:43.040 --> 01:49.200
income, they can go travel, they can experience life to the fullest. Oh, my God. Not so much.

01:49.200 --> 01:55.600
Which bitch, you are living in the most free time in the history of the world. The capitalists

01:55.600 --> 02:01.600
don't get free stuff, they pay for it. You're sitting here and going like, why can't I go on

02:01.600 --> 02:05.840
trips? Because you can't pay for it. Because other people do labor that you don't just have a

02:05.840 --> 02:11.200
unilateral right to access. The people you call the capitalists, the rich people, the people whose

02:11.200 --> 02:16.320
labor is more valuable than you, they can go off and take these trips and have fun. Not because

02:16.320 --> 02:21.040
they're more free, not because freedom is monopolized, but because they've contributed

02:21.040 --> 02:25.840
more to society than you have, and therefore they can afford to pay more people. Which is why

02:25.840 --> 02:29.680
everyone is clawing their way to the top, you know, because then that's where the freedom is.

02:29.680 --> 02:35.280
But what if we had a system where everyone were free, where you didn't have the few at the top,

02:35.280 --> 02:41.600
the rich that monopolized the very idea of living a free and fulfilling life? My God,

02:41.600 --> 02:46.960
even the way that she outlines this is bullshit. What if we just didn't have people at the top?

02:47.520 --> 02:53.440
Not going to happen because we are biologically programmed to be hierarchical, all right? We

02:53.440 --> 02:58.640
compete. Some of us work harder, some of us are smarter. There's only so much equalization you

02:58.640 --> 03:03.280
can do. Yeah, you can give people access to better food, better education, fair enough.

03:03.280 --> 03:08.000
That can definitely improve some people's lives, many people's lives in fact. But there will always

03:08.000 --> 03:12.800
be some people who are better and there will always be some people who are worse, all right?

03:12.800 --> 03:18.960
The guy who was born with 160 IQ and the guy who was born with an 80 IQ, they're not going to be

03:18.960 --> 03:24.400
able to compete. And when you have winners and losers, those wins and losses stack up. That means

03:24.400 --> 03:30.400
hierarchy. That means some people have more. That's just how it is. You're complaining because you're

03:30.400 --> 03:35.760
a loser. I can't stop thinking about all the rich culture and art and music and everything that

03:35.760 --> 03:39.600
we're missing out on because all of these talented workers can't explore their actual

03:39.600 --> 03:44.400
interests. So instead we get the bullshit passion projects of like Jeff Bezos going to space. Bitch,

03:44.400 --> 03:49.600
we already went to space in the 60s. You're not inventing shit. Wow, look at this person.

03:50.240 --> 03:55.360
She literally just wants everyone to live in shit on the earth and not actually strive for

03:55.360 --> 04:00.080
anything greater. Yeah, she talks about the rich culture and art and music that the plebs could

04:00.080 --> 04:03.840
create, but we all know they're not doing that, right? Like if we just gave everyone enough money

04:03.840 --> 04:07.920
to survive and it somehow didn't collapse the economy, you think most people are making rich

04:07.920 --> 04:13.360
culture and art and music? No fucking way. You know what they're doing? They're sitting around,

04:13.360 --> 04:17.920
they're buying big fat TVs, they're watching Netflix and they're getting fat. That's they're

04:17.920 --> 04:21.840
doing that money. We all know it. I think about this all the time in terms of barriers of entry

04:21.840 --> 04:26.560
too for hobbies. Like most of us can't just pick up a new hobby because we have to save up for the

04:26.560 --> 04:30.480
materials while these motherfuckers can go to space just because they wanted to. You know what?

04:30.480 --> 04:36.080
That's pretty based. Stay the fuck out of my hobbies, bitch. Man, if only the expensive

04:36.080 --> 04:40.240
figurines for Warhammer actually kept them out of Warhammer or whatever, right? We need more

04:40.240 --> 04:44.800
gatekeeping. I just wish this method actually worked. And this is why I want worker democracy

04:44.800 --> 04:49.840
so badly because I'm sick of my labor and the labor of others paying for these vacation times,

04:49.840 --> 04:54.800
paying for their fucking hobbies while we get to explore none. And I don't want worker democracy

04:54.800 --> 05:00.880
voting on anything that I do. Get your vote out of my life. Fuck you. Also, I don't buy that this

05:00.880 --> 05:05.600
bitch doesn't have any free time to do hobbies. When did you make this TikTok? Oh, on her free

05:05.600 --> 05:09.760
time. It's a hobby. Okay, give me something different. I don't want any more communist

05:09.760 --> 05:13.200
cope. Let's see something else. If your man complains that you're expensive, just tell him

05:13.200 --> 05:18.000
that there are other girls out there in different price ranges and remind him that you always get

05:18.000 --> 05:22.320
what you pay for. Oh God, I didn't want it to be that though. Now we've gone the complete other

05:22.320 --> 05:27.680
direction. This is a completely different style of retardation. Now we've got like pricey hoes

05:27.680 --> 05:32.000
justifying their pricey wholeness. Let me just watch that again real quick. If your man complains

05:32.000 --> 05:35.840
that you're expensive, just tell him that there are other girls out there in different price ranges.

05:36.880 --> 05:42.080
Like she's talking about herself as a whore, in fact. That wasn't just me making some sort of

05:43.040 --> 05:46.400
like a glib statement. Well, it was me kind of making a glib statement. But you know what I

05:46.400 --> 05:51.600
mean though, right? She's talking about herself as if she exists in a price range and is not a

05:51.600 --> 05:55.360
person. Also, Jesus, I'm just noticing the eyebrows. What the fuck, dude? Doesn't anyone

05:55.360 --> 06:00.800
have normal eyebrows anymore? You always get what you pay for. Oh man, this reminds me of... Oh,

06:00.800 --> 06:06.240
can I find it? Hold on. Let's head over to Twitter. Oh yeah, I found it. This fucking person.

06:06.240 --> 06:12.400
My date had to reschedule. I asked for a small inconvenience fee. I love how he didn't mind.

06:12.400 --> 06:17.440
I originally was going to charge him $50 and realize it's raining. So I factored that in the

06:17.440 --> 06:22.160
fact... Like here, this person's going on... This is a woman, all right? And she's reasonably

06:22.160 --> 06:26.880
attractive, all things considered. She's pretty attractive. But she's going on a date with this

06:26.880 --> 06:34.080
dude and his car... Look at this. His car gets broken into and she's like, well, you've inconvenienced

06:34.080 --> 06:42.400
me. $50. I hope he pumps and dumps her. Get his $50 worth. What the fuck? Oh, it's $100. Oh Jesus.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.480
Yeah, she's just a whore. These people are un-fucking-believable.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.760
Transitioning literally makes you infertile. Okay, let's hear about it.

06:50.880 --> 06:56.880
Okay. You know what? Doesn't make sense. Why? Why would you vote against trans rights? Because

06:56.880 --> 07:05.040
if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating ourselves? Like, come

07:05.040 --> 07:10.560
on. Gay people aren't trans people though. Hold on a sec. Hold on. I got one second. Hold on.

07:11.280 --> 07:15.280
Transitioning literally makes you infertile. Okay. Okay. Come on. Why would you vote against

07:15.280 --> 07:23.600
trans rights? Because if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating

07:23.600 --> 07:30.160
ourselves? Like, come on. Are you admitting here that the whole trans thing, the whole trans rights

07:30.160 --> 07:36.160
thing is actually just taking gay people and turning them trans? This is kind of a talking

07:36.160 --> 07:39.200
point that you see on the center and you see a little bit on the right sometimes, but mainly

07:39.200 --> 07:43.840
in the center. That the hard cultural push for trans rights right now, really promoting

07:43.840 --> 07:48.400
transitioning on some people who are, let's say a little bit gender-bundy, that that's erasing the

07:48.400 --> 07:53.680
existence of gay men. A lot of people who do experience gender dysphoria when they're younger,

07:54.560 --> 07:58.880
when they grow out of it, they end up just being gay men. And so pushing trans stuff hard enough

07:58.880 --> 08:04.480
ends up being like a form of gay erasure. And it just sounds like you're now validating that

08:04.480 --> 08:11.680
opinion. In actuality, trans people aren't gay people. So when trans people, as you say,

08:11.680 --> 08:16.720
castrates themselves, as you put it, that shouldn't have anything to do with the gay

08:16.720 --> 08:21.600
population. So why are you linking them this way? Why would you vote against trans rights?

08:21.600 --> 08:30.000
Because if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating ourselves?

08:30.000 --> 08:35.920
So are you saying that you're not actually a trans person, but a gay person who has trans

08:35.920 --> 08:39.760
themselves? Like what's the logic here? Background noise, but as you can see,

08:39.760 --> 08:44.080
I have some pet dogs and I'm going to see if I can communicate with them. Okay, ready?

08:47.840 --> 08:50.720
Oh my fucking God. Let me try again.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.760
She's farting while twerking. Okay.

08:58.720 --> 09:03.840
Oh, I don't think, I think I insulted them, honestly.

09:03.840 --> 09:09.760
I think you insulted me. Why do you guys send me this bullshit? What am I even supposed to say to that?

09:11.440 --> 09:20.080
Hey guys. Hey. I'm having a hard time. It's one of those days as a nurse that's just not great.

09:21.120 --> 09:26.880
I have a female to male patient who just had their hysterectomy.

09:27.440 --> 09:38.960
Okay. And they're in there grieving their lost organs. A grown adult is psychologically

09:38.960 --> 09:45.600
not prepared to deal with the consequences of such a permanent decision. Jesus.

09:47.200 --> 09:54.400
And as a professional, I can't say anything about it. Oh, because you lose your job?

09:54.400 --> 10:00.640
And yeah, I'm supposed to stand by and I'm supposed to let this happen to children

10:02.320 --> 10:07.440
and I'm supposed to be okay with it and keep silent while seeing these patients over and

10:07.440 --> 10:11.840
over again, emotionally distraught. Jesus. And all the best I can do is hold their hand.

10:12.880 --> 10:18.240
And you're telling me this is a future we should let our children have to deal with

10:18.240 --> 10:22.560
when they're not even as old as my patron is tonight.

10:22.560 --> 10:26.000
So on the one hand, I think she's completely correct about the kids,

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
obviously. No surgeries till you're 18. She's also talking about adults who can't handle it.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.200
And I'm not saying that she's lying. I think she's probably telling the truth.

10:36.080 --> 10:41.600
I'd say there's a 99% chance that she's telling the truth here. However, just because some adults

10:41.600 --> 10:44.880
make decisions they regret does not mean that we should start taking away choices from other

10:44.880 --> 10:50.960
adults. That seems obvious to me. So she said that there was a female to male, I think,

10:50.960 --> 10:56.560
who was in there grieving the loss of their, I assume their breasts. And her heart goes out to

10:56.560 --> 11:01.520
someone who regrets the decision right afterward. And I was like, you know what? Fair enough.

11:01.520 --> 11:07.600
Lots of sympathy. But they are ultimately adults, right? We can feel sympathy for the adult who

11:07.600 --> 11:14.080
smokes and then gets lung cancer. But should we ban smoking? No. We simply have to allow

11:14.080 --> 11:19.360
some adults to fail and to fall through the cracks and to regret their lives because they

11:19.360 --> 11:23.120
made dumb decisions. We should not be pushing them into these dumb decisions, obviously,

11:23.120 --> 11:28.960
which is kind of where the problem is right now, especially with the kids. But I can kind of see

11:28.960 --> 11:33.600
where this goes if you go a few steps down the path and it's going to lead to banning

11:33.600 --> 11:37.600
transitioning for adults. And I don't think that that's right. We should not be encouraging

11:37.600 --> 11:42.160
transitioning for adults, but we shouldn't be banning it either. Nonetheless, it's pretty

11:42.160 --> 11:46.160
heartbreaking to see. All right. I got time for one more. And this one was sent to me by

11:46.160 --> 11:52.720
my girlfriend, Naomi. So let's see it. Honk. What's going on here?

11:56.320 --> 11:57.360
It's an abandoned car?

12:07.120 --> 12:08.640
Oh, someone's sleeping in there.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.920
Dude, you're blocking the road.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.280
Wake up, buddy.

12:24.320 --> 12:31.440
Oh, here he goes. Whoa. He's got to be high or something, man.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.480
Nothing stops me.

12:36.560 --> 12:40.240
Oh, my gosh.

12:54.320 --> 13:00.480
Oh, shit, I shouldn't have woken him up. Oh, my God. Oh, God. You know what? We've had some

13:00.480 --> 13:06.080
depressing TikToks today, but it was nice to end on a high note. All right, guys, I love you.

13:06.640 --> 13:13.120
See you next time. Stay safe. Say your prayers and eat your vitamins. And I'll see you when I see.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.560
I don't know. I don't know if I'm home today or not. Maybe I'll be on the stream tonight.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.880
Maybe tomorrow. Who knows? But I'll see you. Have a good one. I love you.
