00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Hello, it is TikTok Tuesday time once again. I'm recording this on Sunday, though. By the time you

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,480
guys watch it, I'll be out of town. I'm going away for a few days. Anyway, let's see what we're

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,160
watching today. Thanks, guys. A quick reminder that capitalism offers us zero incentives to

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,360
actually be a worker, yet is a system that requires the majority of us to be workers.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:28,640
Oh, my God. Why do we have to start off with this one? Why? I blame you guys. Why? Capitalism

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,040
offers you no incentive. It's called your pay. And you know what? At this point, capitalism

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
doesn't require the majority of you to be workers. We have automation for that. Are you in the fields

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,160
like plowing and making food? No, you're sitting around. The gall of these people, dude. They're

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,640
like, capitalism requires us all to be workers. Meanwhile, you're sitting around on EBT. Get the

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,760
fuck out of here. And before you tell me that the need for survival is the incentive that is given

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,560
to workers to keep on going to work because we need that paycheck to survive under capitalism,

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,520
might I just tell you that it's not that good of an incentive when most of us who work still can't

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,360
survive? Yeah, dude, you look like you're in a third world country. Oh, man, it's so terrible

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,760
for you. You're not surviving? What the fuck? Am I listening to a ghost? Like, oh, yeah,

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,240
go to work so that you can get health insurance, but that health insurance won't actually cover

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,560
everything that you need. Or like, go to work so that you can end up having disposable income.

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
Ha, just kidding. All of that income will then be going to your landlord. You do realize that

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,240
all the Uber eats, that's the disposable income, right? All the Netflix, all the pay as you go

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,560
services, like everything that you're spending your money on. And I think that that's why most

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,400
of us workers intuitively understand that capitalism is a system that monopolizes freedom.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,040
Monopolizes? So the capitalists have all the freedom in the world, they have disposable

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,200
income, they can go travel, they can experience life to the fullest. Oh, my God. Not so much.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,600
Which bitch, you are living in the most free time in the history of the world. The capitalists

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,600
don't get free stuff, they pay for it. You're sitting here and going like, why can't I go on

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,840
trips? Because you can't pay for it. Because other people do labor that you don't just have a

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,200
unilateral right to access. The people you call the capitalists, the rich people, the people whose

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,320
labor is more valuable than you, they can go off and take these trips and have fun. Not because

28
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,040
they're more free, not because freedom is monopolized, but because they've contributed

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,840
more to society than you have, and therefore they can afford to pay more people. Which is why

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
everyone is clawing their way to the top, you know, because then that's where the freedom is.

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,280
But what if we had a system where everyone were free, where you didn't have the few at the top,

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,600
the rich that monopolized the very idea of living a free and fulfilling life? My God,

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,960
even the way that she outlines this is bullshit. What if we just didn't have people at the top?

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,440
Not going to happen because we are biologically programmed to be hierarchical, all right? We

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,640
compete. Some of us work harder, some of us are smarter. There's only so much equalization you

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
can do. Yeah, you can give people access to better food, better education, fair enough.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,000
That can definitely improve some people's lives, many people's lives in fact. But there will always

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,800
be some people who are better and there will always be some people who are worse, all right?

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,960
The guy who was born with 160 IQ and the guy who was born with an 80 IQ, they're not going to be

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,400
able to compete. And when you have winners and losers, those wins and losses stack up. That means

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,400
hierarchy. That means some people have more. That's just how it is. You're complaining because you're

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,760
a loser. I can't stop thinking about all the rich culture and art and music and everything that

43
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,600
we're missing out on because all of these talented workers can't explore their actual

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,400
interests. So instead we get the bullshit passion projects of like Jeff Bezos going to space. Bitch,

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,600
we already went to space in the 60s. You're not inventing shit. Wow, look at this person.

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,360
She literally just wants everyone to live in shit on the earth and not actually strive for

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,080
anything greater. Yeah, she talks about the rich culture and art and music that the plebs could

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
create, but we all know they're not doing that, right? Like if we just gave everyone enough money

49
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
to survive and it somehow didn't collapse the economy, you think most people are making rich

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,360
culture and art and music? No fucking way. You know what they're doing? They're sitting around,

51
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,920
they're buying big fat TVs, they're watching Netflix and they're getting fat. That's they're

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,840
doing that money. We all know it. I think about this all the time in terms of barriers of entry

53
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,560
too for hobbies. Like most of us can't just pick up a new hobby because we have to save up for the

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,480
materials while these motherfuckers can go to space just because they wanted to. You know what?

55
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,080
That's pretty based. Stay the fuck out of my hobbies, bitch. Man, if only the expensive

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,240
figurines for Warhammer actually kept them out of Warhammer or whatever, right? We need more

57
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,800
gatekeeping. I just wish this method actually worked. And this is why I want worker democracy

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,840
so badly because I'm sick of my labor and the labor of others paying for these vacation times,

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,800
paying for their fucking hobbies while we get to explore none. And I don't want worker democracy

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,880
voting on anything that I do. Get your vote out of my life. Fuck you. Also, I don't buy that this

61
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
bitch doesn't have any free time to do hobbies. When did you make this TikTok? Oh, on her free

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,760
time. It's a hobby. Okay, give me something different. I don't want any more communist

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,200
cope. Let's see something else. If your man complains that you're expensive, just tell him

64
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,000
that there are other girls out there in different price ranges and remind him that you always get

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,320
what you pay for. Oh God, I didn't want it to be that though. Now we've gone the complete other

66
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,680
direction. This is a completely different style of retardation. Now we've got like pricey hoes

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
justifying their pricey wholeness. Let me just watch that again real quick. If your man complains

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,840
that you're expensive, just tell him that there are other girls out there in different price ranges.

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,080
Like she's talking about herself as a whore, in fact. That wasn't just me making some sort of

70
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,400
like a glib statement. Well, it was me kind of making a glib statement. But you know what I

71
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,600
mean though, right? She's talking about herself as if she exists in a price range and is not a

72
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
person. Also, Jesus, I'm just noticing the eyebrows. What the fuck, dude? Doesn't anyone

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,800
have normal eyebrows anymore? You always get what you pay for. Oh man, this reminds me of... Oh,

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,240
can I find it? Hold on. Let's head over to Twitter. Oh yeah, I found it. This fucking person.

75
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,400
My date had to reschedule. I asked for a small inconvenience fee. I love how he didn't mind.

76
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,440
I originally was going to charge him $50 and realize it's raining. So I factored that in the

77
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
fact... Like here, this person's going on... This is a woman, all right? And she's reasonably

78
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
attractive, all things considered. She's pretty attractive. But she's going on a date with this

79
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,080
dude and his car... Look at this. His car gets broken into and she's like, well, you've inconvenienced

80
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:42,400
me. $50. I hope he pumps and dumps her. Get his $50 worth. What the fuck? Oh, it's $100. Oh Jesus.

81
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,480
Yeah, she's just a whore. These people are un-fucking-believable.

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,760
Transitioning literally makes you infertile. Okay, let's hear about it.

83
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Okay. You know what? Doesn't make sense. Why? Why would you vote against trans rights? Because

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:05,040
if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating ourselves? Like, come

85
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,560
on. Gay people aren't trans people though. Hold on a sec. Hold on. I got one second. Hold on.

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Transitioning literally makes you infertile. Okay. Okay. Come on. Why would you vote against

87
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:23,600
trans rights? Because if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:30,160
ourselves? Like, come on. Are you admitting here that the whole trans thing, the whole trans rights

89
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,160
thing is actually just taking gay people and turning them trans? This is kind of a talking

90
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,200
point that you see on the center and you see a little bit on the right sometimes, but mainly

91
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,840
in the center. That the hard cultural push for trans rights right now, really promoting

92
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,400
transitioning on some people who are, let's say a little bit gender-bundy, that that's erasing the

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,680
existence of gay men. A lot of people who do experience gender dysphoria when they're younger,

94
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,880
when they grow out of it, they end up just being gay men. And so pushing trans stuff hard enough

95
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,480
ends up being like a form of gay erasure. And it just sounds like you're now validating that

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,680
opinion. In actuality, trans people aren't gay people. So when trans people, as you say,

97
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,720
castrates themselves, as you put it, that shouldn't have anything to do with the gay

98
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,600
population. So why are you linking them this way? Why would you vote against trans rights?

99
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Because if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating ourselves?

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,920
So are you saying that you're not actually a trans person, but a gay person who has trans

101
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,760
themselves? Like what's the logic here? Background noise, but as you can see,

102
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,080
I have some pet dogs and I'm going to see if I can communicate with them. Okay, ready?

103
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,720
Oh my fucking God. Let me try again.

104
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
She's farting while twerking. Okay.

105
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,840
Oh, I don't think, I think I insulted them, honestly.

106
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,760
I think you insulted me. Why do you guys send me this bullshit? What am I even supposed to say to that?

107
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:20,080
Hey guys. Hey. I'm having a hard time. It's one of those days as a nurse that's just not great.

108
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,880
I have a female to male patient who just had their hysterectomy.

109
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Okay. And they're in there grieving their lost organs. A grown adult is psychologically

110
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,600
not prepared to deal with the consequences of such a permanent decision. Jesus.

111
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,400
And as a professional, I can't say anything about it. Oh, because you lose your job?

112
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,640
And yeah, I'm supposed to stand by and I'm supposed to let this happen to children

113
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,440
and I'm supposed to be okay with it and keep silent while seeing these patients over and

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,840
over again, emotionally distraught. Jesus. And all the best I can do is hold their hand.

115
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,240
And you're telling me this is a future we should let our children have to deal with

116
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,560
when they're not even as old as my patron is tonight.

117
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
So on the one hand, I think she's completely correct about the kids,

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
obviously. No surgeries till you're 18. She's also talking about adults who can't handle it.

119
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
And I'm not saying that she's lying. I think she's probably telling the truth.

120
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,600
I'd say there's a 99% chance that she's telling the truth here. However, just because some adults

121
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,880
make decisions they regret does not mean that we should start taking away choices from other

122
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,960
adults. That seems obvious to me. So she said that there was a female to male, I think,

123
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,560
who was in there grieving the loss of their, I assume their breasts. And her heart goes out to

124
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,520
someone who regrets the decision right afterward. And I was like, you know what? Fair enough.

125
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,600
Lots of sympathy. But they are ultimately adults, right? We can feel sympathy for the adult who

126
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,080
smokes and then gets lung cancer. But should we ban smoking? No. We simply have to allow

127
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,360
some adults to fail and to fall through the cracks and to regret their lives because they

128
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,120
made dumb decisions. We should not be pushing them into these dumb decisions, obviously,

129
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,960
which is kind of where the problem is right now, especially with the kids. But I can kind of see

130
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,600
where this goes if you go a few steps down the path and it's going to lead to banning

131
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
transitioning for adults. And I don't think that that's right. We should not be encouraging

132
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
transitioning for adults, but we shouldn't be banning it either. Nonetheless, it's pretty

133
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
heartbreaking to see. All right. I got time for one more. And this one was sent to me by

134
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,720
my girlfriend, Naomi. So let's see it. Honk. What's going on here?

135
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
It's an abandoned car?

136
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh, someone's sleeping in there.

137
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,920
Dude, you're blocking the road.

138
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,280
Wake up, buddy.

139
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,440
Oh, here he goes. Whoa. He's got to be high or something, man.

140
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
Nothing stops me.

141
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,240
Oh, my gosh.

142
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,480
Oh, shit, I shouldn't have woken him up. Oh, my God. Oh, God. You know what? We've had some

143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,080
depressing TikToks today, but it was nice to end on a high note. All right, guys, I love you.

See you next time. Stay safe. Say your prayers and eat your vitamins. And I'll see you when I see.

Maybe tomorrow. Who knows? But I'll see you. Have a good one. I love you.
