0	6640	Hello, it is TikTok Tuesday time once again. I'm recording this on Sunday, though. By the time you
6640	10480	guys watch it, I'll be out of town. I'm going away for a few days. Anyway, let's see what we're
10480	16160	watching today. Thanks, guys. A quick reminder that capitalism offers us zero incentives to
16160	21360	actually be a worker, yet is a system that requires the majority of us to be workers.
21360	28640	Oh, my God. Why do we have to start off with this one? Why? I blame you guys. Why? Capitalism
28640	33040	offers you no incentive. It's called your pay. And you know what? At this point, capitalism
33040	37120	doesn't require the majority of you to be workers. We have automation for that. Are you in the fields
37120	42160	like plowing and making food? No, you're sitting around. The gall of these people, dude. They're
42160	46640	like, capitalism requires us all to be workers. Meanwhile, you're sitting around on EBT. Get the
46640	51760	fuck out of here. And before you tell me that the need for survival is the incentive that is given
51760	56560	to workers to keep on going to work because we need that paycheck to survive under capitalism,
57280	61520	might I just tell you that it's not that good of an incentive when most of us who work still can't
61520	65360	survive? Yeah, dude, you look like you're in a third world country. Oh, man, it's so terrible
65360	69760	for you. You're not surviving? What the fuck? Am I listening to a ghost? Like, oh, yeah,
69760	74240	go to work so that you can get health insurance, but that health insurance won't actually cover
74240	78560	everything that you need. Or like, go to work so that you can end up having disposable income.
78560	83040	Ha, just kidding. All of that income will then be going to your landlord. You do realize that
83040	88240	all the Uber eats, that's the disposable income, right? All the Netflix, all the pay as you go
88240	92560	services, like everything that you're spending your money on. And I think that that's why most
92560	98400	of us workers intuitively understand that capitalism is a system that monopolizes freedom.
98400	103040	Monopolizes? So the capitalists have all the freedom in the world, they have disposable
103040	109200	income, they can go travel, they can experience life to the fullest. Oh, my God. Not so much.
109200	115600	Which bitch, you are living in the most free time in the history of the world. The capitalists
115600	121600	don't get free stuff, they pay for it. You're sitting here and going like, why can't I go on
121600	125840	trips? Because you can't pay for it. Because other people do labor that you don't just have a
125840	131200	unilateral right to access. The people you call the capitalists, the rich people, the people whose
131200	136320	labor is more valuable than you, they can go off and take these trips and have fun. Not because
136320	141040	they're more free, not because freedom is monopolized, but because they've contributed
141040	145840	more to society than you have, and therefore they can afford to pay more people. Which is why
145840	149680	everyone is clawing their way to the top, you know, because then that's where the freedom is.
149680	155280	But what if we had a system where everyone were free, where you didn't have the few at the top,
155280	161600	the rich that monopolized the very idea of living a free and fulfilling life? My God,
161600	166960	even the way that she outlines this is bullshit. What if we just didn't have people at the top?
167520	173440	Not going to happen because we are biologically programmed to be hierarchical, all right? We
173440	178640	compete. Some of us work harder, some of us are smarter. There's only so much equalization you
178640	183280	can do. Yeah, you can give people access to better food, better education, fair enough.
183280	188000	That can definitely improve some people's lives, many people's lives in fact. But there will always
188000	192800	be some people who are better and there will always be some people who are worse, all right?
192800	198960	The guy who was born with 160 IQ and the guy who was born with an 80 IQ, they're not going to be
198960	204400	able to compete. And when you have winners and losers, those wins and losses stack up. That means
204400	210400	hierarchy. That means some people have more. That's just how it is. You're complaining because you're
210400	215760	a loser. I can't stop thinking about all the rich culture and art and music and everything that
215760	219600	we're missing out on because all of these talented workers can't explore their actual
219600	224400	interests. So instead we get the bullshit passion projects of like Jeff Bezos going to space. Bitch,
224400	229600	we already went to space in the 60s. You're not inventing shit. Wow, look at this person.
230240	235360	She literally just wants everyone to live in shit on the earth and not actually strive for
235360	240080	anything greater. Yeah, she talks about the rich culture and art and music that the plebs could
240080	243840	create, but we all know they're not doing that, right? Like if we just gave everyone enough money
243840	247920	to survive and it somehow didn't collapse the economy, you think most people are making rich
247920	253360	culture and art and music? No fucking way. You know what they're doing? They're sitting around,
253360	257920	they're buying big fat TVs, they're watching Netflix and they're getting fat. That's they're
257920	261840	doing that money. We all know it. I think about this all the time in terms of barriers of entry
261840	266560	too for hobbies. Like most of us can't just pick up a new hobby because we have to save up for the
266560	270480	materials while these motherfuckers can go to space just because they wanted to. You know what?
270480	276080	That's pretty based. Stay the fuck out of my hobbies, bitch. Man, if only the expensive
276080	280240	figurines for Warhammer actually kept them out of Warhammer or whatever, right? We need more
280240	284800	gatekeeping. I just wish this method actually worked. And this is why I want worker democracy
284800	289840	so badly because I'm sick of my labor and the labor of others paying for these vacation times,
289840	294800	paying for their fucking hobbies while we get to explore none. And I don't want worker democracy
294800	300880	voting on anything that I do. Get your vote out of my life. Fuck you. Also, I don't buy that this
300880	305600	bitch doesn't have any free time to do hobbies. When did you make this TikTok? Oh, on her free
305600	309760	time. It's a hobby. Okay, give me something different. I don't want any more communist
309760	313200	cope. Let's see something else. If your man complains that you're expensive, just tell him
313200	318000	that there are other girls out there in different price ranges and remind him that you always get
318000	322320	what you pay for. Oh God, I didn't want it to be that though. Now we've gone the complete other
322320	327680	direction. This is a completely different style of retardation. Now we've got like pricey hoes
327680	332000	justifying their pricey wholeness. Let me just watch that again real quick. If your man complains
332000	335840	that you're expensive, just tell him that there are other girls out there in different price ranges.
336880	342080	Like she's talking about herself as a whore, in fact. That wasn't just me making some sort of
343040	346400	like a glib statement. Well, it was me kind of making a glib statement. But you know what I
346400	351600	mean though, right? She's talking about herself as if she exists in a price range and is not a
351600	355360	person. Also, Jesus, I'm just noticing the eyebrows. What the fuck, dude? Doesn't anyone
355360	360800	have normal eyebrows anymore? You always get what you pay for. Oh man, this reminds me of... Oh,
360800	366240	can I find it? Hold on. Let's head over to Twitter. Oh yeah, I found it. This fucking person.
366240	372400	My date had to reschedule. I asked for a small inconvenience fee. I love how he didn't mind.
372400	377440	I originally was going to charge him $50 and realize it's raining. So I factored that in the
377440	382160	fact... Like here, this person's going on... This is a woman, all right? And she's reasonably
382160	386880	attractive, all things considered. She's pretty attractive. But she's going on a date with this
386880	394080	dude and his car... Look at this. His car gets broken into and she's like, well, you've inconvenienced
394080	402400	me. $50. I hope he pumps and dumps her. Get his $50 worth. What the fuck? Oh, it's $100. Oh Jesus.
402400	406480	Yeah, she's just a whore. These people are un-fucking-believable.
406480	409760	Transitioning literally makes you infertile. Okay, let's hear about it.
410880	416880	Okay. You know what? Doesn't make sense. Why? Why would you vote against trans rights? Because
416880	425040	if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating ourselves? Like, come
425040	430560	on. Gay people aren't trans people though. Hold on a sec. Hold on. I got one second. Hold on.
431280	435280	Transitioning literally makes you infertile. Okay. Okay. Come on. Why would you vote against
435280	443600	trans rights? Because if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating
443600	450160	ourselves? Like, come on. Are you admitting here that the whole trans thing, the whole trans rights
450160	456160	thing is actually just taking gay people and turning them trans? This is kind of a talking
456160	459200	point that you see on the center and you see a little bit on the right sometimes, but mainly
459200	463840	in the center. That the hard cultural push for trans rights right now, really promoting
463840	468400	transitioning on some people who are, let's say a little bit gender-bundy, that that's erasing the
468400	473680	existence of gay men. A lot of people who do experience gender dysphoria when they're younger,
474560	478880	when they grow out of it, they end up just being gay men. And so pushing trans stuff hard enough
478880	484480	ends up being like a form of gay erasure. And it just sounds like you're now validating that
484480	491680	opinion. In actuality, trans people aren't gay people. So when trans people, as you say,
491680	496720	castrates themselves, as you put it, that shouldn't have anything to do with the gay
496720	501600	population. So why are you linking them this way? Why would you vote against trans rights?
501600	510000	Because if you hate gay people that much, what's any better than us castrating ourselves?
510000	515920	So are you saying that you're not actually a trans person, but a gay person who has trans
515920	519760	themselves? Like what's the logic here? Background noise, but as you can see,
519760	524080	I have some pet dogs and I'm going to see if I can communicate with them. Okay, ready?
527840	530720	Oh my fucking God. Let me try again.
534720	537760	She's farting while twerking. Okay.
538720	543840	Oh, I don't think, I think I insulted them, honestly.
543840	549760	I think you insulted me. Why do you guys send me this bullshit? What am I even supposed to say to that?
551440	560080	Hey guys. Hey. I'm having a hard time. It's one of those days as a nurse that's just not great.
561120	566880	I have a female to male patient who just had their hysterectomy.
567440	578960	Okay. And they're in there grieving their lost organs. A grown adult is psychologically
578960	585600	not prepared to deal with the consequences of such a permanent decision. Jesus.
587200	594400	And as a professional, I can't say anything about it. Oh, because you lose your job?
594400	600640	And yeah, I'm supposed to stand by and I'm supposed to let this happen to children
602320	607440	and I'm supposed to be okay with it and keep silent while seeing these patients over and
607440	611840	over again, emotionally distraught. Jesus. And all the best I can do is hold their hand.
612880	618240	And you're telling me this is a future we should let our children have to deal with
618240	622560	when they're not even as old as my patron is tonight.
622560	626000	So on the one hand, I think she's completely correct about the kids,
626000	632000	obviously. No surgeries till you're 18. She's also talking about adults who can't handle it.
632000	635200	And I'm not saying that she's lying. I think she's probably telling the truth.
636080	641600	I'd say there's a 99% chance that she's telling the truth here. However, just because some adults
641600	644880	make decisions they regret does not mean that we should start taking away choices from other
644880	650960	adults. That seems obvious to me. So she said that there was a female to male, I think,
650960	656560	who was in there grieving the loss of their, I assume their breasts. And her heart goes out to
656560	661520	someone who regrets the decision right afterward. And I was like, you know what? Fair enough.
661520	667600	Lots of sympathy. But they are ultimately adults, right? We can feel sympathy for the adult who
667600	674080	smokes and then gets lung cancer. But should we ban smoking? No. We simply have to allow
674080	679360	some adults to fail and to fall through the cracks and to regret their lives because they
679360	683120	made dumb decisions. We should not be pushing them into these dumb decisions, obviously,
683120	688960	which is kind of where the problem is right now, especially with the kids. But I can kind of see
688960	693600	where this goes if you go a few steps down the path and it's going to lead to banning
693600	697600	transitioning for adults. And I don't think that that's right. We should not be encouraging
697600	702160	transitioning for adults, but we shouldn't be banning it either. Nonetheless, it's pretty
702160	706160	heartbreaking to see. All right. I got time for one more. And this one was sent to me by
706160	712720	my girlfriend, Naomi. So let's see it. Honk. What's going on here?
716320	717360	It's an abandoned car?
727120	728640	Oh, someone's sleeping in there.
732160	735920	Dude, you're blocking the road.
740560	741280	Wake up, buddy.
744320	751440	Oh, here he goes. Whoa. He's got to be high or something, man.
755440	756480	Nothing stops me.
756560	760240	Oh, my gosh.
774320	780480	Oh, shit, I shouldn't have woken him up. Oh, my God. Oh, God. You know what? We've had some
780480	786080	depressing TikToks today, but it was nice to end on a high note. All right, guys, I love you.
786640	793120	See you next time. Stay safe. Say your prayers and eat your vitamins. And I'll see you when I see.
793120	796560	I don't know. I don't know if I'm home today or not. Maybe I'll be on the stream tonight.
796560	800880	Maybe tomorrow. Who knows? But I'll see you. Have a good one. I love you.
