{"text": " hey there my community of chadley free thinking giga chads if you're watching this on release i would like to let you know that this afternoon and this evening because it always goes on for a very long time i'm going to be on efap again for the third time efap is over on mauler's channel mauler is a friend of mine and i'm happy to be there again this will be the third efap in a row that i'm featured on so maybe in about six hours or so you can head over to his channel and come say hi because i'll be there with the gang and because i'm doing efap tonight i can't do my usual nightly gaming stream so instead you know what i'm doing the gaming stream right now if you're watching this video on youtube on release head over to the game boomers twitch channel or the game boomers youtube channel and i'm going to be streaming kirby and the forgotten land right now so please come say hi i would really appreciate it and enjoy the video thanks guys i love you about two years ago i made a video called we're getting old and it may be worth going back and watching it before checking this one out and though it goes without saying we're still getting old i haven't gotten any younger since then the general point i was trying to get across back then pretty poorly by today's standards because i think i've gotten a lot better at this sort of thing is that millennial leftists have a shared childhood experience they all grew up during an era where the religious right was still a powerful force and youth culture was under attack from that force dungeons and dragons was satanic violence in video games was turning kids into school shooters sexual content in hollywood was creating dysfunctional people skateboarding and graffiti were a gateway to gang violence weed was a gateway to heroin and it was the left that stood in defense of individual liberties and not punishing people for things they can't control people should be left alone to do what they like as long as they aren't hurting others that includes video games and drugs and sex being gay or trans should be protected because they're immutable characteristics in the same way that races and speech should not be censored simply because it's blasphemous to some people this is just old man dev talking about the good old days of the left those days are over nowadays the left talks about dungeons and dragons being problematic because orcs are black people i guess video games turn people into misogynists sexual content in hollywood is objectifying and degrading the left still likes skateboarding graffiti i guess but only if the tag says black lives matter and the drug conversation is a double-edged sword in the left right now as they simultaneously oppose the effects of drugs while still wanting to get high in the most blatant case of wanting to have your cake and eat it too the left now thinks that you cannot be left alone to do what you like because everything is political being gay or trans is a choice not an immutable characteristic and choosing to be those things is okay for the most extreme radicals you have a moral obligation to choose to be gay or trans and that speech should be censored because it is offensive the reason this complete 180 on these principles happened is due to an effect that i described in my g4 frost cure in video when a generation consists of teenagers in their efforts to find themselves they will rebel against the status quo they live in for millennials that's rejecting the hyper civil relatively apolitical yet still conservative boomer order and embracing quasi anarchic politics with a punk aesthetic but when that generation reaches the age in which they start settling down those old rebellious parts of them are deliberately defanged so that they may integrate with society and suddenly these people who were so edgy in their youth begin to view that old edginess as being deeply wrong and so the next generation of youth still in their own rebellious phase are not simply going through the process that everybody else goes through but now they are a fundamental problem with society that's why you see so many videos and articles about how there's large swaths of zoomer fascists right now because those zoomers are teenagers currently in the process of rebelling against the leftist culture that millennials have crafted for millennials it was legitimate for them to rebel because they were rebelling against the right but it's not legitimate for the zoomers to rebel because they're rebelling against the left in essence the millennials have forgotten what it's like to be young they are so incredibly self-centered that they think just because they've figured it out because they've gone through the maturation process that other generations coming up don't need to do the same thing for themselves as well in that way the millennials are almost identical to the boomers they just have the misfortune of lacking any of their material wealth but they're equal in levels of entitlement and delusion i'm talking about this because this clip went viral a couple of days ago to play this game i'm not a noob all right god damn what what a bitch bitch is a bitch talking to me is a female talking to me am i don't know am i tripping am i tripping or how do i tell it's a female talking to me right now it's a fucking female talking to me get off the fucking game and do your wobbly dishes bitch shut up fuck you fuck is wrong with y'all stop talking like that nigga fuck is wrong with y'all dog i'm not one of these little lame ass valor nerd nigga fuck ass ass y'all are pure ass y'all are ass y'all are y'all are ass y'all are ass this guy is i show speed a big time valorant streamer on youtube he's 17 years old and just in case you can't tell he's black this clip blew up because some leftoid esports dude named jake lucky posted it to twitter with the following caption i now understand why valorant cues are so unbelievably toxic you got one of the most popular streamers on youtube i show speed saying crap like this and getting nothing but praise and laughs crap is whack actually unbelievable kids be looking up to this and finding it all right he is 17 my dude he is going to be a mouthy little shit when he's online and his parents aren't around have you forgotten what it's like oh wait you've already gone over this yes you have forgotten but you know what i haven't i remember dropping slurs and gamer words like it was nobody's business as a kid because i was a kid it was hilarious to watch people like jake lucky clutch his pearls in response and you know what it still fucking is and like every other stupid moral outrage we can do the usual things in analyzing it for example this idiot says this guy needs help the idiot's twitter feed is full of him using slurs and making suicide jokes and all the rest of it and then this idiot embarrassingly deletes his complaint because every single woke scold online right now used to do this stuff and now that it's 2022 they all think their shit doesn't stink the actual correct response is to understand that this is fucking banter there's tons of clips floating around where speed is getting slapped with racist shit in chat too you gotta back up man you're a female you got a period ah just heal like only the white characters can heal yeah only only the the white characters can heal i'm sorry hey yo it's all clearly trash talk it's not like speed is walking up to random women on the street and saying get back in the kitchen bitch out of nowhere it's clearly in the context of playing valorant and talking shit now maybe you think that all trash talk all banter is just bad and okay fine you're wrong banter is a fundamental part of the game and it's been a fundamental part of games since long before video games it was part of sports before gaming was a thing you might be wrong but at least you're consistent in thinking that all trash talk is bad most people currently losing their shit at speed aren't consistent they're being pointed at him by a viral tweet and ignoring the hate that he also gets in return because there's a lot of retweets and likes on it and it's a great way to show your followers how fucking morally correct you are by joining in on the dog pile even though get this speed did nothing wrong yes he was being an asshole you can even say he was being sexist if you want to believe that he actually holds these opinions and wasn't just nerd raging out but fundamentally banter is a part of the game it's a part of every game and engaging in it isn't deontologically bad these people just think it is because they've grown up in the most sanitized version of the internet to ever exist such that they believe it's on the level of being brutally stabbed to death if they even so much as see a drop of negativity in their notifications tab look at this look at this fucking comment this is from like 20 years ago everybody who saw this back in the day knew it was specifically designed to be inflammatory it played off schoolyard console war shit and it made people laugh over how over the top it was if some 19 year old soy leftoid saw this on social media today he would probably spontaneously combust there's still enough sane people out there that there has been a sustained objection to speed's treatment by the mainstream the leftist reply to this objection can be summed up here y'all wouldn't have survived cod lobbies in 2009 my brother in christ you are 36 years old it's time to move on the whole modern warfare 2 lobbies thing has quickly become the video game equivalent of dudes holding on to being cool in high school but losers now not evolving as a person is not a flex not growing with society is not a flex you are stuck look at how disingenuously they frame this conversation they think that it's progress to become more censorious they think that it's good to expand the list of the things that you can't say they think that reversing the trend of society moving towards irreverence towards individualism towards expression is what constitutes growing up they think that having thinner and thinner skin over time is a sign of strength rather than obviously it being a sign of extreme weakness in other words they've gotten soft in their old age and they're flabbergasted that young people aren't as old as they are these people are fucking retards they're acting like things have never been worse when things have never been better they're acting like the early days of xbox live didn't have the single most concentration of slurs at any one time on the planet it's like with feminists becoming more radical as they win more rights or black activists or lgbt activists as they win they need to keep justifying their outrage and their existence so smaller problems are treated like they're way worse than they actually are but it's like i said in those previous videos there's something about the competitive nature of gaming that makes it anti-socialist inherently and i think that's why a lot of people look at zoomer gamers and scream fascists and then extrapolate that to this crazy conspiracy theory that there's a new era of fascists on the rise in the west and that kids are going to be groomed into right-wing thought when the reality is the kids are just resisting only partially i might add the left-wing grooming that is currently all over the place in any case speed got completely fucking destroyed the head of youtube gaming is saying they're looking into him and somebody at riot games posted this this is a huge yikes and we do not want players like this in our community at all i went ahead and permabanned this player from valorant as well as all other riot games thanks for raising this please keep raising stuff like this and reporting so we can make valorant safer bitch it's an online shooter people get frustrated people banter it's a fucking violent game welcome to the internet this is why your games have mute and block functions isn't it so great another black kid's career is destroyed over literally nothing except some older white guy didn't like the language he used and it offended his middle class bougie sensibilities no matter how morally righteous the progs claim to be some things just never fucking change", "segments": [{"id": 0,
