00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
I keep a large catalog of text files, images, links, and other documents,

00:04.720 --> 00:10.000
relating to a huge range of topics. They're all tucked away in a research section of my PC,

00:10.000 --> 00:16.080
waiting for their eventual use in a future video. But over time I've had this one file grow and grow

00:16.080 --> 00:24.640
and grow. The file titled sjwnonsense.txt. This is where I store absurd bits of social justice BS

00:24.640 --> 00:28.480
that don't really fit any other topic, but are still funny or stupid.

00:28.480 --> 00:33.520
And this file just keeps inflating over time, so fuck it. Every Sunday from now on I'm going to

00:33.520 --> 00:37.520
pull a handful of links from here and we're gonna have a good laugh at them. And this will also

00:37.520 --> 00:43.760
give me a fun way to post at least one video a week on SFO too. So, welcome to the inaugural

00:43.760 --> 00:49.120
SJ Weekly. The first link we're looking at is a YouTube video from Fortune magazine's YouTube

00:49.120 --> 00:56.720
channel. 50,000 subscribers, 506 views, published on June 20th, 2018. It just seems weird that I

00:56.720 --> 01:02.800
have more of a reach than these guys, you know? But it's called Starbucks is closing 150 US

01:02.800 --> 01:09.760
stores. Now, didn't I call this in my last video on the Starbucks training? I think I might have

01:09.760 --> 01:13.360
heard at the end of it. But let's watch this and see what they have to say about it. Ever feel like

01:13.360 --> 01:18.240
there's a Starbucks in every corner in the US? Well, you're not that far off the mark.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.840
And all of these stores are starting to eat into each other's sales.

01:21.840 --> 01:29.600
So Starbucks announced it will be closing 150 US locations in 2019.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.680
It will also scale back the number of stores it had planned to open.

01:36.800 --> 01:41.600
The company said global comparable store sales were on pace to rise 1% in the third quarter.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.560
The comparable sales performance would be Starbucks' weakest in nine years.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.440
Oh no. But the company has a plan to turn its sales problem around.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.240
Starbucks is trying to increase the number of people who use its loyalty program and mobile app.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.640
Starbucks rewards members have increased by 13% since last year.

02:06.640 --> 02:12.720
It added more cold beverage options to its menu. They make up 50% of its business.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.760
And it's ramping up its refreshment category, which includes iced teas and refreshers.

02:19.760 --> 02:26.080
Starbucks' stock is down 6% over the last 12 months. I wonder why. Jesus.

02:26.720 --> 02:32.880
Maybe this is what happens, Starbucks, when you make a complete fucking mockery of yourselves.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.560
Maybe this is what happens when you say, just open the doors. I mean,

02:36.560 --> 02:41.520
it's just an artificial border anyway, right? Let anybody in. They don't have to be customers.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.680
They can go and trash the place if they want. They can go shit on the floor.

02:45.680 --> 02:49.600
They can go into the washrooms and shoot up some drugs. It doesn't matter, right? It doesn't matter.

02:49.600 --> 02:54.960
None of that matters because they have to be welcome and inclusive. And you have to understand

02:54.960 --> 02:58.960
their truth and whatever other bullshit they were peddling in that Starbucks training video.

02:58.960 --> 03:04.000
Mark my words, guys, this is going to continue. The blowback from the training stuff is only just

03:04.000 --> 03:09.120
beginning. And I think Starbucks is kind of on the way out at this point. Either within five to

03:09.120 --> 03:12.960
10 years, they're going to be gone or they're going to be a drastically different Starbucks

03:12.960 --> 03:17.680
than the one that we currently know. And speaking of things either disappearing or radically

03:17.680 --> 03:23.680
changing, here's an article from Newsweek. White people should stop panicking about losing their

03:23.680 --> 03:29.600
land in South Africa. I can't fucking believe this, all right? I haven't touched on South Africa

03:29.600 --> 03:34.720
yet on the channel. I've been meaning to. I think it's a good topic. I'm just waiting to educate

03:34.720 --> 03:38.080
myself a little bit more on it because I don't know the full details, but let's at least take

03:38.080 --> 03:43.360
a surface glance at this, okay? Opinion piece. White people in South Africa should stop panicking

03:43.360 --> 03:51.120
about losing their land. Why? Really? Think about it for a minute. Okay, fuck off ad. Stop. Wow,

03:51.120 --> 03:56.880
even pausing the ad doesn't stop. I really need to invest in ad block. Why wouldn't you panic

03:56.880 --> 04:02.000
about losing your land? Like if it's land that you lawfully own and you have invested money in

04:02.000 --> 04:06.480
and you paid for, and they're just going to take it. Well, where's your money going to go? You just

04:06.480 --> 04:10.880
lose it? I mean, they're not buying it from you, are they? They're just taking it. That is reason

04:10.880 --> 04:17.280
enough. Race issues aside, and I know that South Africa is like a racial landmine right now,

04:17.280 --> 04:24.640
but race issues aside, just having somebody take your stuff with no recompense and no way out,

04:24.640 --> 04:29.280
that is enough for people to panic about losing their land, yes. But let's see what this idiot

04:29.280 --> 04:34.400
has to say about it. Land reform is a key issue in South Africa due to the long history of

04:34.400 --> 04:39.600
dispossession of indigenous populations by white settlers. Progress has been painfully slow over

04:39.600 --> 04:44.240
the past 24 years, but the question of land is now suddenly at the top of the political agenda.

04:44.240 --> 04:49.520
See, this is why I don't trust the native activists in Canada who say that they just

04:49.520 --> 04:54.080
want their land back or they don't want white people to be displaced or to be sent back to

04:54.080 --> 04:58.640
Europe or to be removed forcibly from the lands that they currently legally owned,

04:59.600 --> 05:05.280
because I guarantee you there is nothing different, really, between native people here

05:05.280 --> 05:11.840
and native Africans in Africa or native Australians somewhere or any population,

05:11.840 --> 05:15.120
because we're all human and there are going to be some commonalities between us,

05:16.080 --> 05:22.640
and one of them is going to be shit like this. So no, I do not trust Canada's native activists,

05:22.640 --> 05:28.000
because I guarantee you if they had the growing power that the black separatists in South Africa

05:28.000 --> 05:32.800
have they would be reacting the exact same way and it would be a terrible situation here.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.440
A major controversy erupted at the end of February following a motion adopted in Parliament

05:37.440 --> 05:42.800
tabled by the Economic Freedom Fighters and modified by the ANC, which started the process

05:42.800 --> 05:48.160
of potentially amending the constitution to allow for the expropriation of white-owned

05:48.160 --> 05:54.400
land without compensation and its subsequent redistribution to black people. In March,

05:54.400 --> 05:59.360
the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, sent out phone messages stating,

05:59.360 --> 06:05.840
ANC and EFF working together to take all private land and homes. You can only stop this if you're

06:05.840 --> 06:11.440
registered correctly to vote. Check now. As a result, white South Africans are panicking

06:11.440 --> 06:15.680
that they will lose their land in their homes, and some white commercial farmers believe this

06:15.680 --> 06:21.440
is the beginning of Zimbabwe-style land grabs. Australia's Minister of Home Affairs even offered

06:21.440 --> 06:26.960
to fast-track visas for white farmers. And to bring up Canada again, it is a great shame

06:26.960 --> 06:32.240
that Canada would not fast-track those visas when asked, and in fact some yahoo in the Canadian

06:32.240 --> 06:37.360
government called the white farmers racist for wanting to flee from this shit. In contrast,

06:37.360 --> 06:41.360
the motion was supported by many other political parties and has been greeted with approval by

06:41.360 --> 06:46.480
large numbers of black people. Given the bitter history of large-scale land dispossession,

06:46.480 --> 06:50.960
refusing to pay for stolen land is seen by many black South Africans as essential to

06:50.960 --> 06:57.840
restoring their dignity. Now I don't know if it's a similar situation as in Canada and the

06:57.840 --> 07:02.240
United States. In Canada and the United States, the land stolen from the natives happened hundreds

07:02.240 --> 07:08.400
of years ago. The people who it was stolen from no longer exist, and the people who stole it

07:08.400 --> 07:13.760
no longer exist. So the land issue over here, the way things are currently sucks,

07:14.320 --> 07:20.640
but it would do far more harm to human beings right now if we started trying to give that land

07:20.640 --> 07:25.520
back, especially when people have lawfully owned it now for centuries. And in fact, natives in

07:25.520 --> 07:30.720
Canada and the United States are not excluded from land ownership by their race. Now I don't know if

07:30.720 --> 07:35.680
the situation in South Africa is the same because with South Africa they had apartheid relatively

07:35.680 --> 07:42.400
recently, right? It was like what 30 years ago or so? So I'm not sure if there are actually instances

07:42.400 --> 07:47.360
of people who are still alive who had land stolen from them, and if that's the case they should

07:47.360 --> 07:52.640
probably have it back, yes. But if this is just some kind of blanket operations along racial

07:52.640 --> 07:58.000
lines it's going to end in disaster. We have an opportunity to pay serious attention to the land

07:58.000 --> 08:03.360
question and to convene inclusive processes to develop solutions to this intractable problem.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.120
As demonstrated once again, racialized inequalities and land holdings are a ticking

08:09.120 --> 08:13.920
time bomb in South Africa. Diffusing it will require courageous leadership and imaginative

08:13.920 --> 08:19.360
policy making. And then to this guy's credit he spends the majority of the article talking about

08:19.360 --> 08:24.960
the detailed ins and outs of South African parliamentary procedure regarding this land stuff.

08:24.960 --> 08:29.920
However, what do you think this guy believes courageous leadership and imaginative policy

08:29.920 --> 08:35.440
making actually entails? Well we can see that at the end. Are land grabs about to begin? Will the

08:35.440 --> 08:40.480
ANC, together with the EFF, amend the constitution in an attempt to facilitate land grabbing on a

08:40.480 --> 08:45.680
large scale? Or will the ruling party under a new president begin to address the failings of its

08:45.680 --> 08:52.000
land reform program? Time will tell. In my view the latter is more likely. The challenge is to do so

08:52.000 --> 08:56.880
in a manner that addresses the political changes that arise from an unresolved land question but

08:56.880 --> 09:02.160
also contributes to poverty reduction. In the meantime white South Africans should be offering

09:02.160 --> 09:08.560
their energies and for farmers some of their land to help find solutions. This will help secure

09:08.560 --> 09:13.360
their future in the country. Whereas attempts to defend their privilege could well lead to the

09:13.360 --> 09:18.640
loss of everything they own. An important lesson from Zimbabwe in the early 2000s. So let me get

09:18.640 --> 09:24.320
this straight. Your opinion here is that in order to deal with a bunch of black people who are

09:24.320 --> 09:28.640
showing up and demanding stuff that they don't legally own from white people, the white people

09:28.640 --> 09:33.440
should simply give it to them. Give them at least part of the land that they own. Because if they

09:33.440 --> 09:38.800
don't, if they defend their privilege, their privilege meaning the stuff that they legally own,

09:39.680 --> 09:45.280
you're going to get Zimbabwe where the black supremacists roll in and kill or expel all the

09:45.280 --> 09:49.680
whites and then just take everything for themselves and then destroy it because they have no idea how

09:49.680 --> 09:54.800
to run anything. This is quite literally just an argument from power stating that if you don't do

09:54.800 --> 10:00.320
what we want we are going to take your stuff and kill you. I mean read this here. Attempts to

10:00.320 --> 10:05.040
defend their privilege could well lead to the loss of everything they own. If you defend yourself

10:05.040 --> 10:10.400
you will be destroyed. So you should just simply cuck to them I guess. That is the progressive

10:10.400 --> 10:14.960
solution to South Africa's racial tensions. Unfucking believable. What's the last article?

10:14.960 --> 10:20.800
Let me try and find it here. And speaking of apartheid, here's the International Business

10:20.800 --> 10:26.320
Times article. When genocide is permissible article taken down by the times of Israel.

10:26.320 --> 10:35.520
So on the times of Israel this article here was published called When Genocide is Permissible.

10:35.520 --> 10:40.800
And here's how the original article read. Hamas has stated forthrightly that it idealizes

10:40.800 --> 10:45.680
death as much as Israel celebrates life. What other way then is there to deal with the enemy

10:45.680 --> 10:49.440
of this nature other than obliterate them completely? We have already established that

10:49.440 --> 10:53.600
it is the responsibility of every government to ensure the safety and security of its people.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.680
If political leaders and military experts determine that the only way to achieve its

10:57.680 --> 11:03.040
goal of sustaining quiet is through genocide then is it permissible to achieve those responsible

11:03.040 --> 11:07.520
goals? Well I think that's the wokest take I've ever fucking seen. I mean wasn't there an old

11:07.520 --> 11:14.240
Roman proverb about this? The whole peace of the grave thing where if everyone's dead then yeah

11:14.240 --> 11:18.880
you'll have peace but it doesn't really mean anything anymore does it? Well even the times

11:18.880 --> 11:22.800
of Israel recognized that this was a ridiculous article and it was pulled. And in fact the

11:22.800 --> 11:27.520
article's author issued an apology Friday afternoon. He said I never intended to call

11:27.520 --> 11:34.320
to harm any people although my words may have conveyed that message. So calling for righteous

11:34.320 --> 11:39.920
genocide all crusades are just. You never intended to call to harm any people really? Do you know

11:39.920 --> 11:45.040
what genocide is? I mean you're Jewish I presume you must know what genocide is. Do you think it

11:45.040 --> 11:49.520
was a walk in the park for your ancestors? Like what do you think was going to fucking happen

11:49.520 --> 11:54.080
when you publish this piece of shit? I wish to express deep regret and beg forgiveness for an

11:54.080 --> 12:00.720
article I authored which was posted on 5tjt.com times of Israel and was tweeted and shared the

12:00.720 --> 12:05.680
world over. I pray and hope for a quick peaceful end to the hostilities and that all people learn

12:05.680 --> 12:10.400
to coexist with each other in creating a better world for us all. This is the kind of mealy-mouthed

12:10.960 --> 12:16.880
wishy-washy nonsense statement that actually says nothing that I would expect someone like this to

12:16.880 --> 12:22.800
put out after he's called for genocide publicly and then had the entire internet shit down his

12:22.800 --> 12:27.360
throat for it. And here's the best part. Even though the article was taken down,

12:27.360 --> 12:32.320
comments about the piece remain. Many Jews were among those slamming the blog post.

12:32.320 --> 12:37.120
I just want to apologize for the stupidity. Genocide is never okay and this kid's a dumbass.

12:37.120 --> 12:42.000
The fact that it was published was just shameful and I seriously hope someone got fired. Seriously,

12:42.000 --> 12:48.320
just like not all Arabs are Hamas, not all Jews or Zionists are genocide advocating twerps.

12:48.320 --> 12:54.080
It is incredible that a person of the Jewish faith could even consider using the word genocide

12:54.080 --> 12:58.880
and questioning whether it is ever permissible. You need to go and take a long hard look at the

12:58.880 --> 13:04.000
history of your people in the 20th century because you do those alive or the millions

13:04.000 --> 13:09.680
murdered in World War II an utterly disgraceful disservice with its Nazi-like drivel. And finally

13:09.680 --> 13:13.360
Twitter actually had some decent takes for once. If you have to question whether genocide

13:13.360 --> 13:17.440
is permissible to achieve sustaining quiet, you have officially failed at life.

13:17.440 --> 13:21.840
Well that about wraps it up for the first SJ Weekly. Considering that episode one

13:21.840 --> 13:26.240
talks about permissible genocide, we can really only go up from here guys.

13:26.240 --> 13:30.080
I'm still working on the other videos, the How Cuck does Canada stuff and other videos.

13:30.080 --> 13:34.000
I'm still streaming on Twitch and doing the video game content. None of that stuff is being

13:34.000 --> 13:39.120
displaced by SJ Weekly. This is just going to be an easy way for me to get out some funny,

13:39.120 --> 13:43.440
goofy shit that is still related to the core content of my channel every Sunday.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.840
So thanks for watching guys, I love you.
