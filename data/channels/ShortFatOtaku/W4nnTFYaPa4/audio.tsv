0	4720	I keep a large catalog of text files, images, links, and other documents,
4720	10000	relating to a huge range of topics. They're all tucked away in a research section of my PC,
10000	16080	waiting for their eventual use in a future video. But over time I've had this one file grow and grow
16080	24640	and grow. The file titled sjwnonsense.txt. This is where I store absurd bits of social justice BS
24640	28480	that don't really fit any other topic, but are still funny or stupid.
28480	33520	And this file just keeps inflating over time, so fuck it. Every Sunday from now on I'm going to
33520	37520	pull a handful of links from here and we're gonna have a good laugh at them. And this will also
37520	43760	give me a fun way to post at least one video a week on SFO too. So, welcome to the inaugural
43760	49120	SJ Weekly. The first link we're looking at is a YouTube video from Fortune magazine's YouTube
49120	56720	channel. 50,000 subscribers, 506 views, published on June 20th, 2018. It just seems weird that I
56720	62800	have more of a reach than these guys, you know? But it's called Starbucks is closing 150 US
62800	69760	stores. Now, didn't I call this in my last video on the Starbucks training? I think I might have
69760	73360	heard at the end of it. But let's watch this and see what they have to say about it. Ever feel like
73360	78240	there's a Starbucks in every corner in the US? Well, you're not that far off the mark.
79200	81840	And all of these stores are starting to eat into each other's sales.
81840	89600	So Starbucks announced it will be closing 150 US locations in 2019.
90960	93680	It will also scale back the number of stores it had planned to open.
96800	101600	The company said global comparable store sales were on pace to rise 1% in the third quarter.
103280	106560	The comparable sales performance would be Starbucks' weakest in nine years.
107520	111440	Oh no. But the company has a plan to turn its sales problem around.
114400	118240	Starbucks is trying to increase the number of people who use its loyalty program and mobile app.
120960	124640	Starbucks rewards members have increased by 13% since last year.
126640	132720	It added more cold beverage options to its menu. They make up 50% of its business.
133680	137760	And it's ramping up its refreshment category, which includes iced teas and refreshers.
139760	146080	Starbucks' stock is down 6% over the last 12 months. I wonder why. Jesus.
146720	152880	Maybe this is what happens, Starbucks, when you make a complete fucking mockery of yourselves.
152880	156560	Maybe this is what happens when you say, just open the doors. I mean,
156560	161520	it's just an artificial border anyway, right? Let anybody in. They don't have to be customers.
161520	165680	They can go and trash the place if they want. They can go shit on the floor.
165680	169600	They can go into the washrooms and shoot up some drugs. It doesn't matter, right? It doesn't matter.
169600	174960	None of that matters because they have to be welcome and inclusive. And you have to understand
174960	178960	their truth and whatever other bullshit they were peddling in that Starbucks training video.
178960	184000	Mark my words, guys, this is going to continue. The blowback from the training stuff is only just
184000	189120	beginning. And I think Starbucks is kind of on the way out at this point. Either within five to
189120	192960	10 years, they're going to be gone or they're going to be a drastically different Starbucks
192960	197680	than the one that we currently know. And speaking of things either disappearing or radically
197680	203680	changing, here's an article from Newsweek. White people should stop panicking about losing their
203680	209600	land in South Africa. I can't fucking believe this, all right? I haven't touched on South Africa
209600	214720	yet on the channel. I've been meaning to. I think it's a good topic. I'm just waiting to educate
214720	218080	myself a little bit more on it because I don't know the full details, but let's at least take
218080	223360	a surface glance at this, okay? Opinion piece. White people in South Africa should stop panicking
223360	231120	about losing their land. Why? Really? Think about it for a minute. Okay, fuck off ad. Stop. Wow,
231120	236880	even pausing the ad doesn't stop. I really need to invest in ad block. Why wouldn't you panic
236880	242000	about losing your land? Like if it's land that you lawfully own and you have invested money in
242000	246480	and you paid for, and they're just going to take it. Well, where's your money going to go? You just
246480	250880	lose it? I mean, they're not buying it from you, are they? They're just taking it. That is reason
250880	257280	enough. Race issues aside, and I know that South Africa is like a racial landmine right now,
257280	264640	but race issues aside, just having somebody take your stuff with no recompense and no way out,
264640	269280	that is enough for people to panic about losing their land, yes. But let's see what this idiot
269280	274400	has to say about it. Land reform is a key issue in South Africa due to the long history of
274400	279600	dispossession of indigenous populations by white settlers. Progress has been painfully slow over
279600	284240	the past 24 years, but the question of land is now suddenly at the top of the political agenda.
284240	289520	See, this is why I don't trust the native activists in Canada who say that they just
289520	294080	want their land back or they don't want white people to be displaced or to be sent back to
294080	298640	Europe or to be removed forcibly from the lands that they currently legally owned,
299600	305280	because I guarantee you there is nothing different, really, between native people here
305280	311840	and native Africans in Africa or native Australians somewhere or any population,
311840	315120	because we're all human and there are going to be some commonalities between us,
316080	322640	and one of them is going to be shit like this. So no, I do not trust Canada's native activists,
322640	328000	because I guarantee you if they had the growing power that the black separatists in South Africa
328000	332800	have they would be reacting the exact same way and it would be a terrible situation here.
332800	337440	A major controversy erupted at the end of February following a motion adopted in Parliament
337440	342800	tabled by the Economic Freedom Fighters and modified by the ANC, which started the process
342800	348160	of potentially amending the constitution to allow for the expropriation of white-owned
348160	354400	land without compensation and its subsequent redistribution to black people. In March,
354400	359360	the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, sent out phone messages stating,
359360	365840	ANC and EFF working together to take all private land and homes. You can only stop this if you're
365840	371440	registered correctly to vote. Check now. As a result, white South Africans are panicking
371440	375680	that they will lose their land in their homes, and some white commercial farmers believe this
375680	381440	is the beginning of Zimbabwe-style land grabs. Australia's Minister of Home Affairs even offered
381440	386960	to fast-track visas for white farmers. And to bring up Canada again, it is a great shame
386960	392240	that Canada would not fast-track those visas when asked, and in fact some yahoo in the Canadian
392240	397360	government called the white farmers racist for wanting to flee from this shit. In contrast,
397360	401360	the motion was supported by many other political parties and has been greeted with approval by
401360	406480	large numbers of black people. Given the bitter history of large-scale land dispossession,
406480	410960	refusing to pay for stolen land is seen by many black South Africans as essential to
410960	417840	restoring their dignity. Now I don't know if it's a similar situation as in Canada and the
417840	422240	United States. In Canada and the United States, the land stolen from the natives happened hundreds
422240	428400	of years ago. The people who it was stolen from no longer exist, and the people who stole it
428400	433760	no longer exist. So the land issue over here, the way things are currently sucks,
434320	440640	but it would do far more harm to human beings right now if we started trying to give that land
440640	445520	back, especially when people have lawfully owned it now for centuries. And in fact, natives in
445520	450720	Canada and the United States are not excluded from land ownership by their race. Now I don't know if
450720	455680	the situation in South Africa is the same because with South Africa they had apartheid relatively
455680	462400	recently, right? It was like what 30 years ago or so? So I'm not sure if there are actually instances
462400	467360	of people who are still alive who had land stolen from them, and if that's the case they should
467360	472640	probably have it back, yes. But if this is just some kind of blanket operations along racial
472640	478000	lines it's going to end in disaster. We have an opportunity to pay serious attention to the land
478000	483360	question and to convene inclusive processes to develop solutions to this intractable problem.
484000	489120	As demonstrated once again, racialized inequalities and land holdings are a ticking
489120	493920	time bomb in South Africa. Diffusing it will require courageous leadership and imaginative
493920	499360	policy making. And then to this guy's credit he spends the majority of the article talking about
499360	504960	the detailed ins and outs of South African parliamentary procedure regarding this land stuff.
504960	509920	However, what do you think this guy believes courageous leadership and imaginative policy
509920	515440	making actually entails? Well we can see that at the end. Are land grabs about to begin? Will the
515440	520480	ANC, together with the EFF, amend the constitution in an attempt to facilitate land grabbing on a
520480	525680	large scale? Or will the ruling party under a new president begin to address the failings of its
525680	532000	land reform program? Time will tell. In my view the latter is more likely. The challenge is to do so
532000	536880	in a manner that addresses the political changes that arise from an unresolved land question but
536880	542160	also contributes to poverty reduction. In the meantime white South Africans should be offering
542160	548560	their energies and for farmers some of their land to help find solutions. This will help secure
548560	553360	their future in the country. Whereas attempts to defend their privilege could well lead to the
553360	558640	loss of everything they own. An important lesson from Zimbabwe in the early 2000s. So let me get
558640	564320	this straight. Your opinion here is that in order to deal with a bunch of black people who are
564320	568640	showing up and demanding stuff that they don't legally own from white people, the white people
568640	573440	should simply give it to them. Give them at least part of the land that they own. Because if they
573440	578800	don't, if they defend their privilege, their privilege meaning the stuff that they legally own,
579680	585280	you're going to get Zimbabwe where the black supremacists roll in and kill or expel all the
585280	589680	whites and then just take everything for themselves and then destroy it because they have no idea how
589680	594800	to run anything. This is quite literally just an argument from power stating that if you don't do
594800	600320	what we want we are going to take your stuff and kill you. I mean read this here. Attempts to
600320	605040	defend their privilege could well lead to the loss of everything they own. If you defend yourself
605040	610400	you will be destroyed. So you should just simply cuck to them I guess. That is the progressive
610400	614960	solution to South Africa's racial tensions. Unfucking believable. What's the last article?
614960	620800	Let me try and find it here. And speaking of apartheid, here's the International Business
620800	626320	Times article. When genocide is permissible article taken down by the times of Israel.
626320	635520	So on the times of Israel this article here was published called When Genocide is Permissible.
635520	640800	And here's how the original article read. Hamas has stated forthrightly that it idealizes
640800	645680	death as much as Israel celebrates life. What other way then is there to deal with the enemy
645680	649440	of this nature other than obliterate them completely? We have already established that
649440	653600	it is the responsibility of every government to ensure the safety and security of its people.
653600	657680	If political leaders and military experts determine that the only way to achieve its
657680	663040	goal of sustaining quiet is through genocide then is it permissible to achieve those responsible
663040	667520	goals? Well I think that's the wokest take I've ever fucking seen. I mean wasn't there an old
667520	674240	Roman proverb about this? The whole peace of the grave thing where if everyone's dead then yeah
674240	678880	you'll have peace but it doesn't really mean anything anymore does it? Well even the times
678880	682800	of Israel recognized that this was a ridiculous article and it was pulled. And in fact the
682800	687520	article's author issued an apology Friday afternoon. He said I never intended to call
687520	694320	to harm any people although my words may have conveyed that message. So calling for righteous
694320	699920	genocide all crusades are just. You never intended to call to harm any people really? Do you know
699920	705040	what genocide is? I mean you're Jewish I presume you must know what genocide is. Do you think it
705040	709520	was a walk in the park for your ancestors? Like what do you think was going to fucking happen
709520	714080	when you publish this piece of shit? I wish to express deep regret and beg forgiveness for an
714080	720720	article I authored which was posted on 5tjt.com times of Israel and was tweeted and shared the
720720	725680	world over. I pray and hope for a quick peaceful end to the hostilities and that all people learn
725680	730400	to coexist with each other in creating a better world for us all. This is the kind of mealy-mouthed
730960	736880	wishy-washy nonsense statement that actually says nothing that I would expect someone like this to
736880	742800	put out after he's called for genocide publicly and then had the entire internet shit down his
742800	747360	throat for it. And here's the best part. Even though the article was taken down,
747360	752320	comments about the piece remain. Many Jews were among those slamming the blog post.
752320	757120	I just want to apologize for the stupidity. Genocide is never okay and this kid's a dumbass.
757120	762000	The fact that it was published was just shameful and I seriously hope someone got fired. Seriously,
762000	768320	just like not all Arabs are Hamas, not all Jews or Zionists are genocide advocating twerps.
768320	774080	It is incredible that a person of the Jewish faith could even consider using the word genocide
774080	778880	and questioning whether it is ever permissible. You need to go and take a long hard look at the
778880	784000	history of your people in the 20th century because you do those alive or the millions
784000	789680	murdered in World War II an utterly disgraceful disservice with its Nazi-like drivel. And finally
789680	793360	Twitter actually had some decent takes for once. If you have to question whether genocide
793360	797440	is permissible to achieve sustaining quiet, you have officially failed at life.
797440	801840	Well that about wraps it up for the first SJ Weekly. Considering that episode one
801840	806240	talks about permissible genocide, we can really only go up from here guys.
806240	810080	I'm still working on the other videos, the How Cuck does Canada stuff and other videos.
810080	814000	I'm still streaming on Twitch and doing the video game content. None of that stuff is being
814000	819120	displaced by SJ Weekly. This is just going to be an easy way for me to get out some funny,
819120	823440	goofy shit that is still related to the core content of my channel every Sunday.
823440	825840	So thanks for watching guys, I love you.
