1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Have you ever noticed how people who are particularly ignorant of the internet call 4chan or Newgrounds

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,360
a social media platform?

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,720
I've heard this from boomers who still think that TV is a new technology.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,160
They have no idea what the internet is, and they're just using the terms they hear their

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,160
grandkids saying.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,280
But I've also heard it from zoomers who only consume online content through whatever

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,320
apps come preloaded on their smartphone.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,160
To them, the entire internet is literally just whatever is in front of the curtain.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,120
I guess as a millennial, I got lucky.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,740
My youngest years were in an era before the internet, and I still got a taste of that

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,480
it's summer, go outside with your friends and be home by dinnertime experience.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,060
But when I finally did make my way online, it was amazingly decentralized.

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,640
Each community had its own website, its own form, its own type of service, when nowadays

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,740
they're all on Twitter or YouTube or whatever.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,040
You can definitely see different species of sites emerge as time went on.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,320
We call Twitter a social media platform, but what it really is, is a microblogging service.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,560
A place where you can post short length random thoughts in a timeline structure.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,240
Facebook operates this way too, same with Gab, Parler, Getter, and Truth Social.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,520
They're all microbloggers.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,760
To contrast, YouTube and TikTok, though they're also considered social media, they're not

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
microbloggers.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,900
4chan's an image board, like 2chan and 7chan and 420chan and all the other chans that have

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,300
popped in and out of existence.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,360
And hey, just as a side note, do you remember that one 4chan April Fools prank where Moot

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
added a cross post to Facebook option and a bunch of retards thinking it was a troll,

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,280
ended up putting porn and shit all over their normie Facebooks for their parents to see?

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,820
Ah, that was good times.

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,060
Point is, the phrase social media seems to have morphed into a Gen Z term for what we

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,040
used to call a website when there's actually multiple different types of sites.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,560
From forms to blogs to video platforms.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,520
The streamer Destiny's website, destiny.gg or DGG, was kind of hard to quantify using

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,240
this paradigm, at least for me.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
Here was my thought process on it.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,720
It's certainly a repository of his stream and YouTube content, but it also serves partially

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,280
as his blog, his merch store, and even his forums.

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,820
And it's got a particular, slick feeling that makes it stand out beyond other portals,

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,360
like Channel Awesome or Newgrounds.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Also, as somebody who's not really a part of the Twitch politics side of the internet,

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,360
when I first noticed that Vosh's website, VGG, was basically a carbon copy of Destiny's,

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,160
I figured that this was some sort of shared plugin system or drop and run setup that was

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
common among this community.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,720
I don't know, is it called a GG site, is that what we're talking about here?

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,800
That's when I discovered what I thought was the source of these sites.

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
A service called White Leaf or White Forest, run by a person named White Nervosa.

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,680
Turns out, White Leaf is the type of website, White Forest is the company providing it,

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,400
and White Nervosa is the person.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,560
White Forest is legally a worker co-op, with nine members, one member, one vote.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,460
They operate White Leaf sites, as well as doing merch fulfillment, thanks to the financial

49
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,640
support of Vosh.

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,680
Their stated goal is to provide an accessible and independent platform for content creators.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,080
And they do have an extensive list of reasonably high-profile leftist people they host.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,520
The ones that I recognize personally are Vosh, Shuonhead, Kefls, Chrisraygun, The Surfs,

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,160
Dylan Burns, Konur, who is some femboy in Vosh's Polycule, Merrick, Xanderhal, The

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,800
Deer Girl, Demon Mama, and Counterpoints, who's actually a Burkean conservative, not

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
a leftist.

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Which initially made me think this service might have been apolitical, just used primarily

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
by leftists.

58
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,680
But of course, that's actually not the case.

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,960
Although the White Forest company is kept afloat by patrons, it's also directly funded

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
by Vosh.

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,540
The fine print reads, no White Leaf users are necessarily affiliated with or endorsed

62
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,500
by White Nervosa or other members of White Forest.

63
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,320
The only content creators that pay White Forest are Vosh or those who choose to be a patron.

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,600
And then I noticed another interesting tidbit down there.

65
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,240
Website framework is a derivative work from DGG, Creative Commons Attribution, Share Like

66
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
3.0.

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
That's right!

68
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,640
DGG is not on the list of White Leaf sites.

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,680
DGG isn't a White Leaf site, all the White Leaf sites are ripoffs of DGG.

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,260
There's a fella in Destiny's community named Cake.

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,600
He does a lot of the tech work over there.

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,980
I've had a couple of casual conversations with him, nice guy, seems competent.

73
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,560
He put out a history of DGG to set the record straight.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,760
The code behind DGG was open source and available for anyone to use, because Destiny wanted

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,440
other content creators to have something they could use for themselves to help bootstrap

76
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
their own careers.

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,400
In early 2019, White Nervosa took the DGG code and made a variant of it for Vosh, VGG,

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,540
which eventually became the White Leaf template.

79
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,840
There was actually early drama between Cake and White Nervosa, as Cake provided his assistants

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,140
believing his work was going towards White Nervosa's own site, not Vosh's site, or

81
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,600
to create a service for many other creators.

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,960
As somebody relatively new to this section of the internet, this stunned me.

83
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,680
How the hell was it that all of these people who hate Destiny have the gall to blatantly

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,680
rip off his site code, even going so far as to say Destiny's got nothing to do with

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
it?

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,700
Alright, here's where I would have subbed in that viral clip of Kefl's from last summer,

87
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,560
streaming during the opening of her own White Leaf site, KGG, where she made the claim that

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,880
her site was actually not ripped off from Destiny's and he had nothing to do with

89
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
it.

90
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,700
I remember seeing that clip all over the place back then.

91
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,280
It must have been retweeted back onto my timeline at least a few dozen times, but by January

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,680
2023, it seems to have vanished from the internet.

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Ah well, I'm sure you all remember it.

94
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,340
It feels kind of like people trying to say that JK Rowling isn't the real creator of

95
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,800
Harry Potter now that her TERF views have come to light, or the Five Nights at Freddy's

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,080
guy doesn't count as the creator after it came out he was pro-life.

97
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,320
It's not hard to see how we got to this point.

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,440
I've done a lot of videos on this topic before.

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,760
Mindless consequentialism, truth is downstream from power, just make reality whatever serves

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,900
the politics, you know the story at this point.

101
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,200
Because of the volatility between Destiny and, like, all of the people using White Leaf

102
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,360
sites, this was obviously going to blow up eventually.

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,480
And it did, with the deplatforming of Rose Wriste.

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,280
Rose Wriste is some young Shoda kid who used to be a streamer.

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
I think he gave it up to go to school or something.

106
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,080
He's very progressive, very much a Nordic model kind of guy, but he is not a revolutionary

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
socialist.

108
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,420
During the Trump era, he and many others like him sided with the socialists online.

109
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,200
But post-Trump, Rose Wriste is another casualty on a long list of casualties from the internet's

110
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,060
socialist-slash-social-liberal split.

111
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,380
Rose Wriste helped Destiny with his huge manifesto on Kefls.

112
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,240
As far as I know, not in terms of digging up information, but in terms of grammar and

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,140
spell-checking, and also working over his logical inferences.

114
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,220
In other words, not on content, but on presentation and polish.

115
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,600
In response, Rose Wriste's White Leaf site, roserist.com, I think it was, was made to

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,920
redirect to the Drop Kiwi Farms site that Kefls put up.

117
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,840
Here's the DMs between Rose Wriste and White Nervosa.

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
Did you change my website?

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,840
White Forest has voted, worker co-op, remember, to discontinue servers to your site.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,120
I wish you the best of luck.

121
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,360
Okay, I understand.

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,940
Can you then fully detach all your stuff from my purchased domain so that it's just a dead

123
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
link?

124
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
You own the domain.

125
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,940
I know that I'm not particularly adept when it comes to website stuff.

126
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,140
I could probably figure out how to disconnect it myself, but I just wanted to ask.

127
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,820
Cake charges $3,000 and then $150 a month for the services you were given.

128
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,420
You cannot ask me for help, no.

129
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,240
Okay, so to be clear, you won't even detach the stuff you've attached to my domain after

130
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,580
you decided to drop it?

131
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,280
To be clear, it is your domain.

132
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,700
If you don't understand that I can't detach it from my servers, that's not my problem.

133
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,020
Sure, but you're doing something to redirect it to Drop Kiwi Farms, right?

134
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Good luck.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,700
Thanks for all your help over the past two years.

136
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
I appreciate it.

137
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,740
Your words ring hollow, but I hope you grow to understand my position.

138
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,800
Here's the tech explanation of what's going on.

139
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,900
When you put in a website into your browser, Google.com for example, your computer communicates

140
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,500
with a domain name registrar.

141
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,780
Google owns the domain name Google.com, and the registrar links that domain with an IP

142
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,600
address, in this case 142.251.42.100.

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,300
If you were to type that set of numbers into your browser, you'd go to the Google homepage.

144
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,200
And believe it or not, in the very early internet, there was no domain names, only IP addresses.

145
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,800
You had to memorize which addresses led to which sites, like telephone numbers without

146
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
profiles attached.

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,760
So, the IP address is the number of a physical computer somewhere on the internet that hosts

148
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
the website.

149
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,600
And the domain name is a shorthand for that address, registered with the registrar.

150
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,340
Rose Wriste owns the domain name RoseWriste.com, and he asked his registrar to have it point

151
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,640
to the IP address of his White Leaf site hosted by White Forest.

152
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,400
But what White Nervosa did was have the IP address on White Forest's end redirect to

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,240
the Kefl's Drop Kiwi Farms page.

154
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,400
All Rose Wriste had to do to remedy the situation was to log in to his registrar and have it

155
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,740
point at a different IP.

156
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,960
But Rose Wriste, not being very tech-savvy, didn't know any of this.

157
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,280
Something that White Nervosa knew he was ignorant of.

158
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,320
That's why the only reply given when Rose Wriste asked, you're doing something to

159
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,200
redirect it to Drop Kiwi Farms, right, was, good luck.

160
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,160
No admission of guilt or innocence, no confirm or denial, just have fun figuring it out,

161
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
fuck you.

162
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,520
I should point out that Rose Wriste, like every other creator with White Forest, with

163
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,360
the exception of Vosh, didn't pay for a White Leaf site.

164
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,960
And White Nervosa retains the right to stop working with anyone at any time.

165
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,300
Nothing illegal has been done here, but it's certainly pretty scummy behavior, taking advantage

166
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,940
of Rose Wriste's ignorance on tech topics.

167
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,480
And eventually, Rose Wriste released a detailed manifesto describing his experience working

168
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,600
with White Forest, where it became clear that this wasn't the only scummy thing White

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
Nervosa had done.

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,320
Here is a list of 9 complaints Rose Wriste had regarding his time affiliated with White

171
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Forest.

172
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
1.

173
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,800
He was not given an opportunity to make his case when White Forest voted to discontinue

174
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
2.

175
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
He was not even given notice that such a vote was happening

176
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
3.

177
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,240
He was not even given notice that services to his website had stopped and only found

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
out several days later 4.

179
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,880
He did not consent to White Forest and White Nervosa changing the server connected to his

180
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,560
domain to make it redirect to a website that they knew he was opposed to

181
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
5.

182
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
He was not given notice that this redirection was happening

183
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
6.

184
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,680
He was treated rudely by White Nervosa when he inquired into the changes

185
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
7.

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,360
He was publicly ridiculed for this interaction by White Nervosa

187
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
8.

188
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
He did not receive any follow-up regarding the handling of sensitive connections or information

189
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,560
of his or of the users who used his website 9.

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,720
He did not receive any assistance with resetting the DNS setting from White Nervosa who knew

191
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,440
he was incapable of doing so.

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,660
As a client of White Forest, you can, without notice or chance to defend yourself, have

193
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,140
your services discontinued, because the 9 members of the co-op have decided to vote

194
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,180
you out, and you won't even be told about it.

195
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,540
You can have your domain redirected to a website you are publicly opposed to.

196
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,180
You can be humiliated, publicly and privately, by White Nervosa herself.

197
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,100
You can be ignored when you ask about the handling of sensitive information stored on

198
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
the site.

199
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,540
And you can be left high and dry in trying to undo the damage they've caused.

200
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,700
White Forest's stated goal of providing an accessible and independent platform for

201
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,980
content creators seems to be a false one, at least if you happen to assist the guy who

202
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,720
originated the code they aped in the first place.

203
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,360
After this whole thing blew up and White Nervosa was dragged on Twitter for it, Rose Wriste

204
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,740
received an apology DM saying, I truly don't wish you deplatformed.

205
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Yeah, alright.

206
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,420
Also, White Nervosa admitted to being drunk during the whole thing, which is, um, okay.

207
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,300
However, the apology only applied to the public ridiculing.

208
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
White Nervosa doubled down on everything else.

209
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,700
In one Twitter exchange, White Nervosa says, Rose Wriste agreed to our standard operating

210
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
procedure.

211
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,280
Is asked, is your standard operating procedure to redirect someone's domain name to a completely

212
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,860
different website they don't want to be affiliated with?

213
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,040
A White Nervosa supporter chimes in with, this is industry standard operating procedure.

214
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,540
When you suspend a service, it is not uncommon to redirect it to the provider's homepage

215
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,440
or a contextually relevant site, and is replied to with, the drop Kiwi Farms site is absolutely

216
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,980
not contextually relevant.

217
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,420
White Nervosa says, he called Kefles a terrorist for attempting to get Kiwi Farms taken down.

218
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,100
It is absolutely relevant.

219
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,600
What actually happened here is that at one point during the Kiwi Farms drama, Kefles

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,140
was pointing out that Kiwi Farms was hosted in Ukrainian server farm and then posted its

221
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,140
location, implying that Ukrainian partisans may want to attack it because Kiwi Farms hosts

222
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,420
Russian propaganda.

223
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,140
Destiny described this in his manifesto as calling for terroristic violence, the manifesto

224
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,020
that Rose Wriste edited for grammar and logic, and specifically not content.

225
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,500
To White Nervosa, this was Rose Wriste calling Kefles a terrorist.

226
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,740
The reply guy asks, so you're purposely redirecting his domain name to a website for a cause he

227
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,580
specifically doesn't agree with, and that's somehow morally okay to you?

228
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,700
And White Nervosa simply replies, yes.

229
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,220
White Nervosa also made a big dance around that standing operating procedure of theirs,

230
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,980
stating White Forest discontinues sites that have been inactive for more than 90 days.

231
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,380
When this happens, there is a default screen for if there's nothing to catch the URL.

232
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,020
Rose Wriste had passed the mark, handling over two dozen websites that wasn't a top

233
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
priority.

234
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,360
After he contributed to and endorsed a document calling for Cloudflare to protect Kiwi Farms,

235
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,420
it became a priority.

236
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
This was Sunday.

237
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,500
He didn't notice until Wednesday, which is when I acted poorly towards him.

238
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,180
I regret that and apologize.

239
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,020
Anybody who claims it's because he dared attack Kefles ignores that he streamed in

240
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,540
July critiquing Kefles.

241
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,540
This was not an issue.

242
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,120
You literally just mentioned one tweet ago that it was about the Kefles document.

243
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,880
Of course, people began to notice all the holes in this argument.

244
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,800
The dear gender person hadn't streamed in six months, but is still on White Forest.

245
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,080
White Nervosa replied, oh, it's because she's still getting automated donations.

246
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,240
This idea that Rose Wriste wasn't getting any automated donations is weird to me.

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,040
Rose was small but still doing well, well enough to have some automated subs or something.

248
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,800
But White Nervosa, who is the only one with access to the logs, stated, nope, Rose had

249
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,000
no donos, don't question it, even though Rose Wriste provided proof of many donations

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
during that time.

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,920
Moreover, Rose Wriste did in fact stream during the 90-day period, nine times, and you can

252
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,400
see the distinctive White Leaf chat overlay in those streams.

253
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,920
White Nervosa then claimed that Rose Wriste asked for a site to be deleted, which Rose

254
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,280
Wriste's own DMs disprove, and then finally claims that it actually is about Kefles, saying

255
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,600
it would not be brought back up assuming he maintained his endorsement.

256
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,760
Dude, at this point, just bite the bullet.

257
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,380
Say it was a power move and that you did it because you're in charge and you didn't

258
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,240
like what Rose Wriste did off platform.

259
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,520
We know that's why you did it.

260
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,720
You know that's why you did it.

261
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,560
All this dancing around just makes you look like even more of a fucking snake.

262
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,840
For a while, I believe that White Nervosa as a person was just a side story to the larger

263
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Kefles drama.

264
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,800
A little extra bit of an intermission in between the real happenings.

265
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,280
But now, I think White Nervosa is actually a lolcow in her own right.

266
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,600
And the reason I've come to that conclusion is the Chud logic drama.

267
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,400
All the stuff with Rose Wriste was months ago.

268
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,040
It was involving White Nervosa's capacity at the head of a business, and it involved

269
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Kefles.

270
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,400
But now, White Nervosa herself is just going nuts over literally nothing.

271
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Let's check it out.

272
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,440
On January 17th, White Nervosa tweeted this.

273
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm out of my mind, Chud logic, but is there any reason you're paying a person who felt

274
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,620
the need to tweet this twice?

275
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,640
Are you too lazy to find another editor?

276
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,840
Are they doing it for scraps off the plate so it's worth it?

277
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,320
Is there no connection you feel?

278
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,520
This is in response to DriftKingEdits, also known as DK, Chud's editor, tweeting the

279
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,140
following in quick succession.

280
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,480
Not really sure what's going on, but Andrew Callahan definitely didn't rape that young

281
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
lady.

282
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,880
Followed by, not really sure what's going on, but Andrew Callahan definitely raped that

283
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
young lady.

284
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,800
Now, I'm not really sure what's going on with Andrew Callahan, but I'm pretty sure

285
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
this is a joke.

286
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,020
It's literally the cover all your bases thing.

287
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,420
And White Nervosa was offended by it, to the point that she went to Chud logic and did

288
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,960
the cancel culture, why is he your editor thing.

289
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Chud's response was to point out that while White Nervosa is tagging him into the tweet,

290
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,440
making it look like to her followers that she's inviting him to have a conversation,

291
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,000
she's actually got him blocked.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,480
He can't see it, so it looks like he's ducking her.

293
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,120
But he replied anyway, simply saying, I will never kowtow to the gay retarded sensibilities

294
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,920
of leftoids based, always reject the struggle session.

295
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,720
The Twitter canceling attempt went nowhere.

296
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,640
So White Nervosa took it a step further by reporting Chud's Twitch channel to Twitch

297
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,000
because he called her a gay retard on Twitter.

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,480
And even though Twitch's off platform policies can be kind of ridiculous, even they weren't

299
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,380
ridiculous enough to take this bait.

300
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,520
Twitch has explicitly told me that it's okay that the partner Chud logic has called me

301
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,740
another partner, a gay retard.

302
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,440
Take that as you will and do as you wish off platform, as long as it's not an imminent

303
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
threat.

304
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,160
Yeah, Twitch's off service conduct policy states that Twitch will ban you if you do

305
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
any of the following off platform.

306
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
1.

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,880
Engage in deadly violence or terrorism or terroristic recruiting.

308
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
2.

309
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Explicit and or credible threats of mass violence.

310
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
3.

311
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,760
Explicit and or credible threats against Twitch.

312
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
4.

313
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,040
Leadership, membership, sponsorship of a known hate group.

314
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
5.

315
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,360
Carrying out or acting as an accomplice to sexual assault.

316
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
6.

317
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Sexual exploitation of youth.

318
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
7.

319
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,080
Compromising the physical safety of the Twitch community.

320
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
8.

321
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Harmful misinformation.

322
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,080
And any of this stuff applied to Chud logic calling White Nervosa a gay retard.

323
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,480
It's not terrorism or violence, it's not a credible threat, it's not membership

324
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,840
in a hate group unless you count the Chud nation, it's not sexual assault or exploiting

325
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,040
youth or threatening the safety of Twitch, and perhaps most explicitly of all, it's

326
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,560
not misinformation either.

327
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,040
White Nervosa continued to complain about Twitch refusing to take action on offsite

328
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,460
behavior beyond what's listed.

329
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,560
And the reason why is explicitly because she wants Chud logic deplatformed.

330
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,240
Hey, and like with Rose Wriste, at least she has the balls to say it directly this time.

331
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
Or maybe it's because Chud's an easier target among leftoids than Rose Wriste was.

332
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Who knows.

333
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,100
Chud's reply was to call White Nervosa a disgusting freak who has no problems with

334
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,800
abusing power and is now making a concerted effort to deplatform him.

335
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,840
White Nervosa mocks the concerted effort bit by saying she sent one email and she actually

336
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
doesn't really care.

337
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,120
Despite, of course, being the one who started the Nothing Burger and pushing her followers

338
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
to go at it.

339
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,880
Chud's editor, DK, returned to write a lengthy anime villain post about how basically, White

340
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,840
Nervosa is a fraud hack who will fade away because everything she's ever done that's

341
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,520
noteworthy has been stolen by others and the next wave of innovation will be the end

342
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,680
of her 15 minutes of fame.

343
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,240
The backlash White Nervosa received from all of this nonsense was enough to make her leave

344
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,380
Twitter for a few days.

345
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
But only a few.

346
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,040
These people always come back eventually.

347
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,000
White Nervosa is also a moderator for Vaush's community, though she may be on a break from

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that position for a while.

349
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She's friends with him.

350
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She still runs his site.

351
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
She gets paid by him.

352
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,240
And was a mod for a long time.

353
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,920
While White Nervosa was offline, some other Vaush mod, Thena, publicly continued the crusade

354
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,880
in her place, repeating the calls for Twitch to ban Chud.

355
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,320
But more notably, she went into Vaush's community and began petitioning Vaush viewers to join

356
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,720
in on the dogpile, saying that Chud is violating his Twitch partner contract by harassing her

357
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,200
over her gender identity.

358
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Excuse me, but where the fuck did this happen?

359
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Come on, you really think you can just go on the internet and make shit up?

360
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,320
Afterward, Thena banned Chud from VGG and the Vaush subreddit, as well as a bunch of

361
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,400
other people who aren't even in these communities but have publicly spoken out against White

362
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,640
Nervosa, most notably Stardust, who's been laughing at all this nonsense on her stream.

363
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,240
Now, these people have the right to run their shitty little communities however they like.

364
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,280
But this is just like 2015, 2016 all over again, where the leftoids won't tolerate

365
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,120
anybody who disagrees with them even a little bit and will go scorched earth on everyone

366
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
who steps out of line.

367
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,760
And I'm not being hyperbolic.

368
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,120
There was also the White Nervosa deny milkshakes drama.

369
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,440
Deny milkshakes is some other flavor of leftist.

370
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,120
These people always eat each other.

371
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,840
And last fall, these two nobodies were at war.

372
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,560
Deny milkshakes said Japanese nuclear bombings were genocidal terror apologia and he would

373
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,360
block anyone who was partisan in favor of the bombings.

374
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,520
Nervosa replied, calling him indistinguishable from a tanky and that he was making light

375
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,880
of the Holocaust.

376
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,360
Just so we're clear, there's a reason that socialists look at every other socialist

377
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
except themselves and see fascists.

378
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,640
White Nervosa, a totally sane person, replied to deny milkshakes by threatening to, if he

379
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,640
did not agree to a streamed debate with her, block him, block his followers, and punish

380
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,360
everyone using White Forest by deplatforming all of them.

381
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Well, hold on there.

382
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,280
I thought this was a worker co-op, White Nervosa.

383
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,960
I thought you needed a vote of the nine crumbtubers who run the whole thing in order to be able

384
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,280
to do something like this.

385
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,120
This is how the leftoid worker democracy always degenerates into an authoritarian shithole,

386
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
by the way.

387
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,600
It's always because another leftist disagrees with them and they can't accept disunity

388
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,700
among the proles.

389
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,320
The backlash to this event was severe, way more than anything related to tread logic,

390
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,820
to the point that White Nervosa scrubbed the internet of it in an effort to get people

391
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,280
to forget it ever happened.

392
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,120
But the internet never forgets.

393
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,360
And get a load at what the internet remembered.

394
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,600
To be more specific, they said they were okay with Kefl's, Xanderhal, Roserist, Vosch,

395
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,880
Marek, and several others being deplatformed because they refused to have a conversation

396
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,960
about calling me a genocide apologist.

397
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Are you serious, bitch?

398
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
You were the one with the finger on the off switch.

399
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,680
This is nobody else's fault but your own.

400
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,580
Why in the fuck would you ever get yourself a White Leaf site when the dictator running

401
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,360
the whole operation can nuke you off the internet simply because she got into a Twitter

402
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,720
spat with a random person you don't even know?

403
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,440
Now this whole thing so far has just been lame twitter drama.

404
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,700
And if it were only lame twitter drama, it wouldn't really be worth it for me to do

405
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
a video on it.

406
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,400
I enjoy watching Chud and Stardust dream about it, it's pretty fun to watch petty drama

407
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
sometimes.

408
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,920
But my personal interest on its own isn't enough for me to make a video on the topic.

409
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,640
What I discovered after digging into White Nervosa myself, though, was...

410
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,520
Let's start at the surface level stuff.

411
00:19:49,520 --> 00:20:14,760
Check out Vosha's comments on this shitshow.

412
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:27,300
Hold on, pause it right here.

413
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,840
Look who posted that Xanderhal tweet in Vosha's chat.

414
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,280
Oh, it's Xanderhal!

415
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,480
The only guy who would ever actually post a Xanderhal tweet anywhere.

416
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,960
He's literally doing the tattletale thing.

417
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,520
And if you look around online, you'll find a lot of these crumbtubers all trying to pile

418
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,720
on Chud and trying to get Vosha to come out against him.

419
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,600
You gotta cancel Chud logic, guys.

420
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,320
Vosha's reply, though, is kind of anemic.

421
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,440
On the one hand, he doesn't seem to care too much about this stuff.

422
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,640
But on the other, he's completely fine with his mods behaving this way.

423
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,460
Now, I personally don't think that's a problem.

424
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,320
What my mods do outside of the context of my community isn't any of my business, and

425
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
I extend that chariability to everyone.

426
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,520
But that's not the rules the progs use.

427
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,800
These people are losing their marbles over what DK does and how Chud is obviously co-signing

428
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,500
it all by continuing to employ him.

429
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,980
So by that standard, Vosha is a worse person because of White Nervosa's terrible behavior.

430
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,060
And the Chud deplatforming is just the tip of the iceberg.

431
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,340
It's also how, while trying to get Chud deplatformed, they cry that any pushback they

432
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,020
receive is harassment.

433
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,820
This is literally the Jani cries out in pain as she strikes you.

434
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,040
These people cry about body positivity and bigotry and trans-nonsense while at the same

435
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,940
time using low testosterone as an insult.

436
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,520
These people were the ones who face-doxed Chud logic in the first place.

437
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,940
These people were the ones who thought it was a good idea to try and cover up Vosha's

438
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,860
sexual harassment allegations.

439
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,340
White Nervosa and her White Forest crowd are the gang of people who do the on-the-ground

440
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,900
work of following around leftist streamers, most commonly Vosh, and cleaning up their

441
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,420
messes, while serving as relentless attack dogs against anyone who dares to cross their

442
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,660
parasocial daddies.

443
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Let's rewind.

444
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
January 26th, 2018.

445
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,860
Over a year before White Nervosa took the open-source DGG code and made a closed for-profit

446
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
fork of it.

447
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,860
She was a member of Destiny's community, no surprise there, and debated him on the

448
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
topic of deplatforming.

449
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,780
I can't believe we're here, five years later, having the same fucking conversations.

450
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,360
This stream actually isn't too spicy, and there's not one clip that I can pull out

451
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,060
to explicitly prove what I'm saying.

452
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,640
It's the tone of the thing, you kinda have to watch it for yourself.

453
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,980
White Nervosa is clearly trying to nudge Destiny to the left throughout the conversation, with

454
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,040
the general tenor of the conversation being, well, these rightoids are idiots, so you should

455
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,860
be agreeing more with us leftoids, right?

456
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,940
And Destiny, to his credit, doesn't take the bait.

457
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,260
I need a criterion by which I can deplatform somebody that I can objectively argue for,

458
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,420
which is difficult.

459
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,820
The big problem with me for deplatforming is that, to deplatform somebody, it almost

460
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:50,420
feels like you're saying, my philosophy is objectively superior to yours, because what

461
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,120
I need is I need an argument by which I can deplatform another that wouldn't allow me

462
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,420
to get deplatformed, because I wouldn't want to be deplatformed, right?

463
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:02,740
So how would society deplatform people, like, if society were to do it?

464
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,780
For example, Twitter would deplatform people by, if you share fake news or something, like,

465
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,980
these would be my criterion, right?

466
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,500
Like, if you post lies or something like that, you'd be deplatformed on Twitter or something,

467
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,140
they would ban your accounts or something like that.

468
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,900
I don't know.

469
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,220
You'd have to be very rigid and very specific in your set of criteria.

470
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,740
For somebody like Warski, like, how is he supposed to platform somebody responsibly?

471
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,860
Like, what would he do to actually not be a Nazi?

472
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,620
Oh, so I'm not even on that, like, platforming people responsibly?

473
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Like, I, maybe.

474
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,660
I don't know if Andy's, like, if you bring on a bunch of Nazis and you don't challenge

475
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,140
their opinion, I don't consider that to be falling under the purview of what I would

476
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,300
be going after.

477
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:48,300
It would be going after people who are intentionally or with gross negligence or recklessness spreading

478
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
fake news.

479
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,500
That would be, like, my starting ground, and that's the only part that I'm at right now.

480
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,500
So, like, if somebody wants to come on and argue, like, listen, I want to create an ethno-state,

481
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,860
I want to get all the blacks and all the Mexicans out of here, like, fine, that's fine.

482
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,540
That person gets a platform, they can argue their shit, I love free speech.

483
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,140
It's a goddamn beautiful thing.

484
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,260
But if that guy wants to get up and make that argument by spreading a bunch of bullshit

485
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,620
news around, by linking to fucking Breitbart articles that have bullshit sources, by quoting

486
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,260
headlines and sniping data and not really making an honest argument, fuck that guy.

487
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Take him out.

488
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,100
So when you say Worsky doesn't, or he's irresponsibly platforming people, should he not be allowed

489
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,900
to carry on that platform, or?

490
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,340
Oh, no, Andy can, um, Andy can platform whoever he wants.

491
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,260
I just don't like that he doesn't acknowledge the reality of it.

492
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
I mean, if he, I don't think it should be, like, illegal.

493
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Oh, yeah, now it's an immoral issue.

494
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
One.

496
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:41,380
Right, I feel like, though, like, um, some countries really, like, yeah, I feel like

497
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:48,780
America has a good freedom of press, freedom of speech, and you don't think that any other

498
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,740
country should adopt, or rather, reverse, you don't think we should adopt any of the...

499
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,700
I don't know, like, shit like the Germany shit, like, makes me pretty wary, like, that

500
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,180
you can't even do, like, that hail Hitler salute, or you can get in trouble, you can

501
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,180
get fined for that.

502
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,180
Why does that make you weary?

503
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,300
I don't know, because I, fuck, if I want to go outside and do the hail Hitler salute,

504
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,820
I don't want to get in trouble by the state.

505
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,140
It's fucking crazy to me.

506
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,180
Fuck that shit.

507
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
I'm a free goddamn American.

508
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,780
Well, you're a free American who supports responsible platforming.

509
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,060
Yeah, but supporting responsible platforming doesn't mean that I explicitly or implicitly

510
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,140
support, like, throwing people in jail for shit.

511
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,620
Well, wait, there is a, there's a thing where, like, a line that, irresponsible, irresponsibly

512
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,140
speech could get you thrown in prison.

513
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,260
I don't agree with that, unless it's literally, like, direct calls to harm or something.

514
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
How indirect could you get?

515
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,260
I don't fucking know.

516
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,260
It's up to the courts to decide.

517
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,340
Like, if there was a, if there was a march, and they chanted, kill all Jews, or killed

518
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,580
the Jews, is that direct, or?

519
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,460
That sounds pretty direct to me, yeah, sure.

520
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,580
Anytime you're saying kill, and then something, it's probably over the line, right?

521
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Yeah, no, yeah, that makes sense.

522
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Yeah.

523
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,060
So what's your opinion of hate speech laws?

524
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,500
I don't know, I would have to think really hard about it.

525
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,580
My gut tells me that I think they're bad.

526
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,220
I feel like the hate speech laws are there to give that pre-, not necessarily preemptive

527
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:21,700
strike, but, like, when speeches basically kill all, kill all of, you know, this group.

528
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
Mm-hmm.

529
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,820
I think, I think that's why the hate speech laws are there, because they're not necessarily

530
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,780
a threat towards any one person, but what do you charge them with otherwise?

531
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,820
I mean, if that's what you mean by hate speech, like, just, like, directly threatening somebody,

532
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,180
then I'm probably- Well, no, no, right, it's, it's, it's more

533
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,940
broad than just that, but- Sure.

534
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,140
I think it covers a lot of, um, areas that need to be covered.

535
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,140
Why aren't you a socialist?

536
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
I love capitalism.

537
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,260
Why can't you have a capitalist market system under socialist means?

538
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,620
I mean, doesn't capitalism also speak to things like labor and whatnot?

539
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,660
Which, and it doesn't let all that labor and everything work fundamentally differently

540
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
in a socialist system?

541
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:09,260
Sure, but wouldn't labor be more, um, well, couldn't unions be a form of-

542
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,220
Um, but unions don't oftentimes- Well, hold on, I have to think about whether or not,

543
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,780
do unions represent market power or not?

544
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,120
Um, basically, whenever I ask, whenever I think about a question like this, what I'm

545
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,660
trying to think of is, is there a market failure?

546
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,340
And if there's a market failure, I'm always okay with, with some sort of government intervention,

547
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
right?

548
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,300
So, just to trigger x skills me in the, in the chat, something like net neutrality, I

549
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,580
would consider the, um, the natural, the, the ISP's being prone to being naturalistic

550
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,080
monopolies, I would consider that a form of market failure.

551
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,260
And market failures, I think, should always be remedied by some sort of government policy.

552
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,380
So, would a company being too big to have any threat of, of unionizing happen, and where

553
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,380
no other companies could compete?

554
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,280
I mean, if that market failure existed, then yeah, I would be okay with remedying that

555
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
with government shit.

556
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Does that make sense?

557
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Yeah, that makes sense.

558
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Yeah.

559
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,880
Um, a lot of people in chat are bringing up that they live in countries where the lines

560
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,280
are shared and, and ISPs have to rent the lines.

561
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,560
I mean, like, that seems like the reasonable thing for me, like, it's, it's infrastructure

562
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,600
that the whole city should care about because pretty much everybody has internet, so I'm

563
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,160
okay publicly paying for it.

564
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,200
We want to keep the lines running well, and then an ISP can open a data center and they

565
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,280
can run, you know, they can hook up at the last, you know, towards them.

566
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,680
So, so do you think U.S. should go in that direction?

568
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
We should start at least.

569
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Probably.

570
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Yeah.

571
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Well, well, you sounded really hesitant there, buddy.

572
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,180
Well, because everything, everything is informed, everything is informed by the data.

573
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,180
I don't know, like, if, if, if shit turns bad, then no, but like, that seems like a

574
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,180
good, a good thing to me, I think.

575
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,520
That seems like a good direction forward, but maybe there, there might be a better argument

576
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,000
against it, but yeah, because I don't, I don't know what the argument would be for having

577
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
independent lines or everybody owning their own lines or whatever.

578
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
It just seems like a huge fucking waste.

579
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,780
There's nothing really too bombastic in this video.

580
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
No big blowout.

581
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,000
White Nervosa just kind of meekly says, okay, after getting pushed back every single time.

582
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,360
It feels like she wants to pull him to the left, but also doesn't want to jeopardize

583
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,560
her connection to him.

584
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,240
Some of you might be saying, Dev, you're reading into this way too much.

585
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,720
How can you possibly know that?

586
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,780
Well, I know it because of a conversation that White Nervosa had with Vosh on her channel

587
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,320
a year later on March 12th, 2019 titled, um, to kill cops.

588
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,900
This is White Nervosa's first encounter with Vosh, and it's from this meeting that becoming

589
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,960
a moderator and creating his website with the forked code that would eventually become

590
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,340
White Leaf would spring.

591
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,480
There's a few interesting things in this conversation.

592
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,520
One, White Nervosa and Vosh both consider liberals, fascists, centrists, and rightists

593
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
to all be the same thing.

594
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,920
Kind of like how some rightoids think that all liberals, socialists, centrists, and leftists

595
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,040
are the same thing as well.

596
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,120
It's just centrism, right?

597
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,960
It's just the typical centrist, right?

598
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:51,920
That's just like, like until they die, you know, both sides are radical and both sides

599
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,680
are equal and both sides need to come together.

600
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,440
Even though one side is literally Nazis.

601
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Yeah.

602
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,720
Um, I mean, that sounds like some of the centrists that I've discussed in the past.

603
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,800
It is, it is fucking incredible to me.

604
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,160
It's amazing how, um, how subjective centrism is these days.

605
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,640
Um, Nazism sure is closer to the center than I, uh, than I originally interpreted.

606
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Yeah.

607
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Like, holy shit.

608
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,920
I just can't even tokens like Dave Rubin, right?

609
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,520
Like he's a liberal, right?

610
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,200
And like these are his talking points and the same thing with Candace Owens and the

611
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,160
same thing with Ben Shapiro and the same thing with, um, yeah, like it just goes on and on.

612
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,880
But yeah, like I think like the biggest problem is people don't perceive how like harmful

613
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,400
it is to public discourse and like centrism is fucking cancer for that.

614
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:51,080
Just the ignorance of like, uh, the Overton window and again, like crypto fascism and

615
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,920
I mean, I don't like, I don't know.

616
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,200
Like I fucking hate, I fucking hate him.

617
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,360
I hate him so goddamn much, fascists and centrists.

618
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I don't know.

619
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
I don't know how to improve.

620
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
It just doesn't make any sense.

621
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,840
Cause I feel like every demonstrable study shows like, like these are, this is supposed

622
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
to be the facts over feels crowd.

623
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,960
Nope, centrists have never read a study in their entire life.

624
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
You can drop that right now.

625
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,840
None of them have ever read a single study.

626
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,480
Like centrists will acknowledge like psychological pitfalls, but then like they always fall back

627
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,920
on this weird, like, so, so it is like they are still right wing because they still always

628
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,480
fall back onto individual like responsibility.

629
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,360
Like, like, like for fascism, I view the only means is violence.

630
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,840
You can only defeat fascism with violence, right?

631
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,200
There is no argument.

632
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,760
There's no, like, like the centrist will always be drifted towards fascism.

633
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,600
So the only way to combat it is to dissuade fascists from protesting.

634
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
So you have to hit them with violence.

635
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,760
Does not exist in America because there is no revolutionary movement and how they want

636
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
to be a part of one.

637
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,200
I think like, I don't fucking know.

638
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Like what makes a person want to be centrist?

639
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,200
Is it they, they were like a conservative, but conservatism is a cool because the average

640
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,560
age of Republican in America is 900.

641
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,920
So they want to be like the edgy fucking libertarian centrist.

642
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,680
Is it because they once went to a college campus and they think they're kind of liberal

643
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,360
and then like some, a woman with blue hair yelled at them and now they're assuming like

644
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,640
I don't, I don't know.

645
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,800
Whatever it is, it stems from ignorance or stupidity or fear.

646
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,440
It's like, like a little bit of just stunning Kruger, right?

647
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,160
They, they just know like a little bit about politics and they think they know so much.

648
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,960
Like they think they see like the extreme left and the extreme right, but like they've

649
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,200
just made this like fossil equivocation that just doesn't exist.

650
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,400
Like there is no extreme left.

651
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,280
We will become the extreme left and we will stride across this great land, um, seize the

652
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,440
means of production.

653
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
You know?

654
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Oh yeah.

655
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Yeah.

656
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
Okay.

657
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Yeah.

658
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
Let's well, yeah.

659
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,200
I mean, you know, I mean, I'd say like, you know, the car was going down the wrong street

660
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,240
and you know, Charlottesville, you know, it's just White, Nervosa and Vosh talk about how

661
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,560
while a far left party winning elections would be ideal, a revolutionary movement of working

662
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,600
class people, uh, storming the seat of government is also good too.

663
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
As long as they're leftist.

664
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,180
Of course, I think we need at least another century, maybe a century and a half of class

665
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,160
consciousness spreading amongst the pros before we're ready to have a revolution.

666
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,700
And when it happens, I would like it to happen in conjunction with a far left political party

667
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:40,520
gaining prominence in the legislator, which would be able to secure a clean transition

668
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:46,380
of power rather than the literal like citizens up revolt against the entire United States

669
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,700
military storming Washington, taking control of the, uh, oval office.

670
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,380
Um, you know, broadcasting a message of victory to the rest of the American people.

671
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,380
I hope that in the future, the material circumstances eventually arrive at a point where, um, where

672
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,300
they feel revolution is possible.

673
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,300
They're okay.

674
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,340
If police die during this uprising, I presume you're not in favor of outlawing armor piercing

675
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
bullets.

676
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Fuck that.

677
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,080
The only people who wear armor are cops.

678
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:26,520
They're hoping for a revolution that may occur in more than a century, but in the meantime,

679
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,400
we have bullets designed explicitly to kill cops.

680
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,920
Oh, I mean, yeah.

681
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.

682
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,200
Just because I advocate for a revolution in the future doesn't mean I'm not okay with

683
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,920
cop killing now.

684
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,480
But at the same time, they also don't want individuals to actually own guns.

685
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,060
They want the guns to be owned by the community and kept in a community armory, which is just

686
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,060
the state owning all the guns again with a new label attached.

687
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,540
But ideally I wouldn't like guns to be kept in the house.

688
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:58,220
I would like there to be like, uh, community armories, um, that neighborhoods would have

689
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,740
where like, if there was ever a need to, uh, you could go to this like sort of collectively

690
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,380
owned bunker maintained by the community and you've got your fucking mousins and F4s and

691
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
shit.

692
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,380
For rebranding, I think like, uh, you could pitch it as just a shooting range, right?

693
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,440
Like you can even own like a automatic weapons, right?

694
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,660
Just lock them up at the shooting range and then you go grenade launchers.

695
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,120
Absolutely own that shit.

696
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
Grenade launchers.

697
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,860
I want the fucking anti-tank mines.

698
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:31,060
I want the God, I want the sniper rifles that can penetrate, um, police, uh, car doors.

699
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
I want all that shit.

700
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,220
I want them stock block.

701
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,580
I want the fucking barrel.

702
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,460
I want the barrel, the chamber loaded as you pick up the gun.

703
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,740
I want us to be ready.

704
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,820
They also have no real concern with what happens after the revolution either, as long as it

705
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,380
moves the world ever more leftward.

706
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,100
Is your end game to abolish the state wholesale?

707
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,020
I don't really care what happens after we overthrow capitalism.

708
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,260
The material circumstances of the time will dictate what comes next.

709
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,920
I just want to see us move forward, move leftward.

710
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,460
And by the way, they don't believe that democracy can do this.

711
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,300
I reject the idea that electoralism is the means by which we can overthrow the hold police

712
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,320
have on disenfranchised communities.

713
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,720
And finally, White, Nervosa and Vashj describe hiding their true beliefs and subverting this

714
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
system from the outside.

715
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,800
Like, couldn't you like falsely moralize that to yourself though?

716
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,720
Because I feel like I could very easily fall into that like psychological trap where I

717
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,280
could like moralize myself or, you know, say that I'm not doing tangible harm to public

718
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
discourse.

719
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm just doing it for a paycheck to feed my family and to further like my own personal

720
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
goals.

721
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,840
I don't know if I could justify it ethically under my own like personal set of values,

722
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,720
but I do know, I think the only way that I could come away from that thinking like, okay,

723
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,200
maybe I'm not going to blow my brains out in this gas station bathroom.

724
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,320
The only way I could come out feeling like I'm not doing that is if I thought like, okay,

725
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,720
I'm building power from within, but one day I will unveil my true power level.

726
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,160
Personally on a personal level, I do not think that I could do it unless I had some

727
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,560
sort of like secret underlying motive, some way in which I felt I was actually supporting

728
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,720
the leftist cause.

729
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
I understand how other people could do it though.

730
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,880
Not everyone is as politically enfranchised as you or I have such strongly formed opinions,

731
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,000
such a firm understanding of theory.

732
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,640
The most refreshing part of all of this is seeing a more mask off Vashj than he is nowadays.

733
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:38,520
So then if you believe that Republicans have intent right now to bring about an LGBT genocide,

734
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,720
how can you morally object against people right now taking arms and going out and killing

735
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,960
Republican lawmakers?

736
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Exactly.

737
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Republican lawmakers?

738
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Yes.

739
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,000
Well, it would be a utilitarian thing, wouldn't it?

740
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Oh God, stop.

741
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Stop.

742
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Which unfortunately I don't really think it's possible to know that because I'm not God,

743
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,040
but as a general rule, that type of thing doesn't tend to work out.

744
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
But there are plenty of examples-

745
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:10,580
Ask him this, if it did work out, if they were able to kill lawmakers with no consequences,

746
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,000
would it be morally justified, question mark?

747
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,640
You know, are a legitimate-

748
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Ask him.

749
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Let's hear it.

750
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Make him answer our question.

751
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,080
... are trying to use that power to suppress minority groups.

752
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,680
You talked about the utilitarian thing before.

753
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,360
So if it would be possible, if it were to be possible to get away with killing Republican

754
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,880
lawmakers with no consequences, would it then be-

755
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,840
Are you actually fed posting at me right now?

756
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
You're glowing in this convo.

757
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Wait, are you being fed these questions?

758
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,240
Ah, he won't answer that question.

759
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
I knew he wouldn't.

760
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,400
I knew he wouldn't answer that question.

761
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,440
He won't do it.

762
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
He won't do it.

763
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,960
What a fucking weaselly little coward.

764
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,200
2023, Vosh is too scared to say what he really thinks.

765
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,700
He likes the Twitch bucks too much, so he hides his power level.

766
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,340
And Vosh on IRL panels?

767
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
Forget it.

768
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,700
The milk toast progressive opinions you can imagine.

769
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,820
If you look at any major social movement, you will see disinformation.

770
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,780
That was the case with BLM, that was the case with the civil rights movement, the suffragette

771
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,620
movement, the abolitionist movement, the American revolution, and everything prior to it.

772
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,300
Misinformation is just a part and parcel.

773
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,100
If you try to minimize it, but at the end of the day, it is something that will be produced

774
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,700
and sometimes focused on.

775
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,660
You have to take a look at the underlying social motivations and the processes that

776
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
led to that.

777
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,140
So with regards to the January 6th stuff, again, you can, as you said, normalize very

778
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,000
terrible stuff with the wrong descriptive understanding of the world.

779
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,700
You can take just about every heinous totalitarian ideology that's ever festered on this planet,

780
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,960
you know, whether you want to go Nazism or Stalinist, Pol Pot, wherever you want to go.

781
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,460
If you fed a person the right set of facts about the world, big air quotes, by the way,

782
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,940
you could approximate those ideologies in them.

783
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,120
Compare that take to this one and you'll see exactly what I mean.

784
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,900
There is not a good base of conservatives in this country.

785
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,240
These people are no different from the Ku Klux Klan.

786
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,220
They are no different from the fucking white nationalists who ran terror campaigns in the

787
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,560
South back during the 1920s, 30s, 40s.

788
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,780
They are absolutely no different from the frothing at the mouth screaming fucking pasty

789
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,380
male people who are throwing rocks at black folk going to integrated schools.

790
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,780
There is no difference.

791
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,400
If you have a conservative family member, I'm sorry, they're part of the problem.

792
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,100
If you have a conservative friend, I'm sorry, they're part of the problem.

793
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,760
History will crush these people beneath its feet.

794
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,400
Every single time a political party has tried this shit, every single time they've gone

795
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,480
down this road, they have been reviled through the generations.

796
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,020
There is no good history for these people.

797
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,560
And every conservative, every Republican is on the hook for this.

798
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,800
Every last one of them.

799
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,620
These people present one view when they're in real life and being challenged directly

800
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,200
and another view entirely when they feel like only their community, their people are watching

801
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,480
and they're safe from the eyes of outsiders.

802
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,640
They are just as subversive as the fascists they claim to oppose.

803
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,840
They tell the big lie just as much.

804
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,360
They too hide their real politics until the moment is right.

805
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,280
Three, stemming from their subversiveness, White-Nervosa and Vosch both admit that the

806
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,640
reason they hang around destiny is to convert him to their political beliefs and to pull

807
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,040
his audience into their sphere of influence.

808
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:13,080
I've seen like, yeah, you go toe to toe with destiny on economics and I kind of accidentally

809
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,760
push him further away because I pushed him towards getting rid of minimum wage.

810
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Oh no.

811
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,640
I think, I honestly, the best way to radicalize destiny and leftward is to, if you're a leftist,

812
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,560
is to not talk with him because he gets really fucking angry and defensive talking to leftists.

813
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,000
I feel, I almost feel for him because he, he's like, cause he's a lib boy, you know,

814
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,080
he's a good old lib guy and, and because he gets popular debating on these idiot right-wingers,

815
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,560
he'll like sort of throw him in with the lefties.

816
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,000
But now he feels like this performative need to distance himself from them so he can stand

817
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,320
alone on his own little, like, yeah, yeah, he definitely loves, like it, it's almost

818
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,680
like a virtue signal, like that he loves to like say like, oh man, I guess you're a communist,

819
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
right?

820
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,400
Like, like, like, uh, in a condescending way in a discussion, um, we'll get them one day.

821
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Yeah.

822
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,360
I mean, well, I, I feel like, like, like, again, like just by accident, right?

823
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:23,640
Just by him, I mean, cause fuck, he used to be a libertarian, so he's on the right track.

824
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,720
He just has to get there.

825
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,640
White Nervosa also decries the equivalence between the radical left and the radical right

826
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,840
as a symptom of fascism, which destiny did in their previous conversation, but she was

827
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,160
too cucked to speak up about.

828
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,120
Like Dave Rubin, I think it's an easy example that shouldn't have a platform.

829
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,640
Well, no, I'm not sure I would have to think about Ruben.

830
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,520
So again, I want to be really, really, really careful here.

831
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Okay.

832
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,800
So remember primarily my value system is usually going after what is true.

833
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,240
I don't care about political agendas.

834
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,080
I have no desire to push a political agenda whatsoever.

835
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
I don't care.

836
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,520
I have no interest, no desire.

837
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,800
So I think that all offensive ideas should be spoken about.

838
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,960
So pedophilia, incest, Ku Klux Klan, Nazism, ethno states, all of that shit, communism,

839
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
whatever the fuck.

840
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,640
All of these ideas should be up for discussion.

841
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
I'm okay with that.

842
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,840
And I'm okay with people providing a platform to discuss these ideas.

843
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,200
The ideas don't bother me.

844
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,160
It's just engaging in disinformation or misinformation or reckless, like reckless reporting that

845
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,360
is like horrendously disingenuous.

846
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,880
Yeah, I don't have, I don't want to name drop too many people, but the reason I specifically

847
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,760
think of Ruben instantly is because he really, really interviews a lot of people who are

848
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,640
far to the alt-right and even further so, and I feel like platforming those people and

849
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,640
giving them just basically a softball interview to pitch their platform, I feel like really

850
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,840
does a disservice to everybody that's watching.

851
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,120
I don't, I don't agree with that.

852
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,320
I mean, it gets the ideas out there.

853
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,720
Even if you might find them offensive or horrible, it just gets the ideas out.

854
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,440
I mean, do you make all softball interviews illegal then or?

855
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,360
Well, no, not at all, but I mean, isn't that, isn't that your point though?

856
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,040
Cause isn't that sort of fake news on, on steroids.

857
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
No, I don't think so.

858
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
The pinnacle of that.

859
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
Well, like, so here's a question.

860
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,320
If you want to go after people that give softball interviews to extremists, what about somebody

861
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,400
that has a channel where they interview like Contra points or the interview Sean and January

862
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,120
somebody, and they give them all softball questions, would that be no, I feel like that's

863
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
entirely different.

864
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:29,160
If your channel, give me some, wow, very clearly a stilted, uh, slant, you know, you're just

865
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
an interview channel.

866
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,840
But Dave Rubin, I don't feel like is presented as such as it's presented as the marketplace

867
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,280
of ideas, which it very clearly isn't.

868
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,280
Yeah.

869
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Maybe.

870
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
I don't know.

871
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
I guess it's, it's, I like to focus on branding and presentation.

872
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,520
I like to focus on fake news because I can do a hard line objective.

873
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,840
Like this is bullshit.

874
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,040
You're screenshotting article headlines.

875
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,720
You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.

876
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,880
Like you're, you're lying to your teeth.

877
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,400
That's easy to target saying somebody like Dave Rubin, disingenuously, disingenuously

878
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
presents as policy.

879
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,680
I feel like that line is a lot harder to walk.

880
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,200
Yeah, maybe so.

881
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Maybe.

882
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,800
So this is all a year and a half before destiny and Vash stopped publicly being friends after

883
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,200
that infamous Kyle Rittenhouse debate destiny always described Vash as his friend, white

884
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,960
nervosa spent time in his community as a noted orbiter, but it seems to be increasingly obvious,

885
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,680
at least to me that these people were simply using him the whole time for, and to tie it

886
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,480
all into one neat package, Vash and white nervosa advocate for direct violence against

887
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,400
fascists, keeping in mind that to them, fascists are not only fascists, but liberals, centrists

888
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
and rightists.

889
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,680
And she even readmits as much in the statement.

890
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:42,880
And I feel like we can win on like, like socialism because emotional appeals or emotional propaganda

891
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
is very, very easy.

892
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,360
How do you win on like against fascism?

893
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,760
Like, because that's a really tough, like, you know, they, they show like the other and

894
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,280
they're going to take, you know, your kid's job, like, I mean, I don't, I don't think

895
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,480
you can argue with fascists.

896
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,080
I think they just need to be killed or something.

897
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,160
I don't disagree with you, but I mean, like from a, like for attacking, uh, like centrists,

898
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,320
like how do you attack, especially since it's so crypto in the first place, like, like it's

899
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,720
not usually Charlottesville and like it's a wordness.

900
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,080
I mean, ideally I think a lot of centrists are crypto fascist too, and they get the bullet

901
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,080
as well.

902
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,640
But the system we live in today is full of violence as it exists.

903
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,640
And to ignore that.

904
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Yeah.

905
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,640
Oh God.

906
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
That fucking triggers me.

907
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
This is literally nothing.

908
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,280
Well, like, I mean, people don't realize that a government is just a society agreeing on

909
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,280
violence.

910
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,520
Like, you know, like, like if guns are being passed around, like fucking, I mean, I, like,

911
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,320
I don't know, fucking well, like let's go.

912
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,280
What matters is if you see me in the street with my Mosin, okay, what matters is that

913
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,280
I join you with two.

914
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Okay.

915
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,280
All right.

916
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,280
Yeah.

917
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
My fucking comrades.

918
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,400
Hey, destiny being a liberal is only there to either be subverted or destroyed.

919
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,160
And because they both failed to subvert him and they're both too bitch baby to actually

920
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,080
do anything outside their own houses, destroying him online is the next best thing.

921
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,500
With all of this additional context, look at white nervosa statement on the Rose wrist

922
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,400
thing again, allow this to be a larger statement on those who look towards DGG for a place

923
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,000
to be rather than a place to move on from.

924
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,720
They don't watch your content.

925
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,720
Never.

926
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,720
You're nothing but a tool to them.

927
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
This isn't picking sides.

928
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,640
This is understanding that DGG isn't a place for growth.

929
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,840
On the one hand, you're entirely wrong.

930
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,680
There's a ton of content creators who have benefited greatly from the destiny bump, erudite,

931
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,880
stardust, counterpoints, even vosh, but the difference is that they took the exposure

932
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,200
destiny gave them and then made something that was new, something that was them using

933
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,640
the opportunity properly.

934
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,400
White nervosa didn't like DK said, everything she's done is simply a copy of the work of

935
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
better people.

936
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,200
On the other hand, though, this mindset of white nervosas pretty much proves my point

937
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,040
that her and her crowd are just users.

938
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,040
To them, DGG is a stepping stone to appeal to when it builds them up and to attack when

939
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,040
it builds them up.

940
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,620
Vash and Asan did this to destiny.

941
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,700
A bunch of crumb tubers did it too, book smarts, Merrick, Xanderhal.

942
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,960
This is also what's happening to chud logic right now.

943
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,880
And now that twitch politics has become an insular lefty only space, they're turning

944
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,080
on each other for clout as they always do.

945
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,020
Right now, as I'm recording this bad bunny and keffles are getting into a fight because

946
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,280
they're both fucking irrelevant, contributing nothing of substance to anything.

947
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,220
And despite their public exclamations of commitment to the leftist cause, they're only here

948
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,220
to make money.

949
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,980
And yes, underneath all of the rhetoric, that's all it is for any of these leftoids.

950
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,780
You don't need to actually build socialism if you're a rich socialist because you've

951
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,180
got the correct beliefs.

952
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,260
So whatever is a good consequentialist end for you is what the good is.

953
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,060
In fact, with white nervosa, it's even more blatant because the main reason she even tried

954
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,000
to be a streamer before the whole white forest thing is so that she could stream snipe other

955
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,440
people's auto-hosts and turn those donations into cocaine.

956
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,940
And no, this isn't just some Kiwi Farms rumor, though they get a kick out of it too.

957
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,160
This is something that is actually confirmed by her.

958
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:58,960
Yeah, I mean, I just love the EU streams, I'm trying to jack the auto-hosts from everybody

959
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,560
else so, you know, we start early as fuck.

960
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,900
Listen, just know that if you support the White Leaf Project, all that money is going

961
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,500
straight up her nose.

962
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,480
At this point, let's check out the big picture.

963
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,640
White Nervosa is a core part of Vasha's community, paid by him to rip off Destiny's

964
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,400
code for his, and later, all of BreadTube's use.

965
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,520
This entire group shares the same ethics, which constitute a violent support of revolutionary

966
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,640
leftism without any concern of the actual behaviors involved, or concern for any of

967
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,760
the outcomes beyond what is simply good for them.

968
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,920
And beneath that mask, what is good is whatever makes them money.

969
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,640
And people who disagree with what they consider the good to be exist only to be exploited

970
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,280
by them, to either be converted to their cause or discarded and destroyed.

971
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,540
And in order to accomplish all of this, these people are willing to lie, to cheat, to steal,

972
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,580
to attack you in the street if they had the opportunity, to deprive you of your income

973
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,420
so that you and your dependents starve, to go against every stated value that they claim

974
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,820
to hold, including things like universal human rights or democracy.

975
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,160
There is a direct throughline between the rhetoric these people used in 2018 and 2019

976
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,440
and their morally reprehensible behaviors today.

977
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,460
They were always going to become this.

978
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,540
This is why people in my area of the internet spoke out about it all those years ago.

979
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,780
We all told Shu on head she was going to get backstabbed.

980
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,780
She didn't believe us.

981
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,780
And here we are.

982
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,140
She was scamming chudlogic in like April 2022 or something, saying, I bet demon mama backstabs

983
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,140
you within the next six months.

984
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,540
And he was like, I don't know, man.

985
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,820
And lo and behold, she did.

986
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,700
When I spoke to Dylan Burns, I told him there will probably eventually be backlash for you

987
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,740
and I talking, especially if you do it regularly.

988
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,740
And it hasn't come yet.

989
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,000
But, you know, it will.

990
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,660
I don't agree with Sargon or ArchWarhammer all the time.

991
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,740
We have some very rowdy debates in private, but we never violate the meta-ethic that is

992
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,740
the friendship.

993
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,660
Over some political disagreement, why would we?

994
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,540
Even though they're drifting away from me politically, and I agree with them less and

995
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,100
less over time, they are vastly better people than any of these BreadTube fucks.

996
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,920
White Nervosa herself is just a blip on the radar.

997
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,540
She will fade in the same way that Kefles is fading, now that her Drop Kiwi Farms campaign

998
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,380
has failed spectacularly.

999
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,260
Even if you were braindead enough to be interested in the BreadTube socialist type of thing,

1000
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,700
all of her content is just what the larger BreadTubers say, only strictly worse.

1001
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,140
Her only claim to fame is exactly as DK said.

1002
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,780
She stole the work of better people.

1003
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,300
She enriched herself, temporarily, off that work.

1004
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,880
She has no ability to innovate on that foundation.

1005
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,740
And so, when the ecosystem moves on, she will be left behind.

1006
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:14,660
Her one claim to fame is fleeting fast, and nothing else she's ever done has any substance

1007
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,660
whatsoever.

1008
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,140
She will one day wake up and discover that the cocaine money has dried up, nobody's

1009
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,180
keeping up with her anymore, nobody's using the few dollops of value she stole from others

1010
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,180
anymore.

1011
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,660
Theirs is a community of users, in many ways.

1012
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,180
And White Nervosa is rapidly reaching the end of her usefulness.

1013
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,060
I don't know why she thinks she won't be discarded, in the same way that she and

1014
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,260
her ilk have discarded so many others.
