0	10800	Have you ever noticed how people who are particularly ignorant of the internet call 4chan or Newgrounds
10800	12360	a social media platform?
12360	15720	I've heard this from boomers who still think that TV is a new technology.
15720	19160	They have no idea what the internet is, and they're just using the terms they hear their
19160	20160	grandkids saying.
20160	24280	But I've also heard it from zoomers who only consume online content through whatever
24280	26320	apps come preloaded on their smartphone.
26320	29160	To them, the entire internet is literally just whatever is in front of the curtain.
29160	31120	I guess as a millennial, I got lucky.
31120	34740	My youngest years were in an era before the internet, and I still got a taste of that
34740	38480	it's summer, go outside with your friends and be home by dinnertime experience.
38480	43060	But when I finally did make my way online, it was amazingly decentralized.
43060	46640	Each community had its own website, its own form, its own type of service, when nowadays
46640	48740	they're all on Twitter or YouTube or whatever.
48740	53040	You can definitely see different species of sites emerge as time went on.
53040	57320	We call Twitter a social media platform, but what it really is, is a microblogging service.
57320	61560	A place where you can post short length random thoughts in a timeline structure.
61560	65240	Facebook operates this way too, same with Gab, Parler, Getter, and Truth Social.
65240	66520	They're all microbloggers.
66520	70760	To contrast, YouTube and TikTok, though they're also considered social media, they're not
70760	71760	microbloggers.
71760	75900	4chan's an image board, like 2chan and 7chan and 420chan and all the other chans that have
75900	77300	popped in and out of existence.
77300	81360	And hey, just as a side note, do you remember that one 4chan April Fools prank where Moot
81360	85520	added a cross post to Facebook option and a bunch of retards thinking it was a troll,
85520	89280	ended up putting porn and shit all over their normie Facebooks for their parents to see?
89280	90820	Ah, that was good times.
90820	96060	Point is, the phrase social media seems to have morphed into a Gen Z term for what we
96060	100040	used to call a website when there's actually multiple different types of sites.
100040	102560	From forms to blogs to video platforms.
102560	108520	The streamer Destiny's website, destiny.gg or DGG, was kind of hard to quantify using
108520	110240	this paradigm, at least for me.
110240	111840	Here was my thought process on it.
111840	115720	It's certainly a repository of his stream and YouTube content, but it also serves partially
115720	118280	as his blog, his merch store, and even his forums.
118280	122820	And it's got a particular, slick feeling that makes it stand out beyond other portals,
122820	124360	like Channel Awesome or Newgrounds.
124360	128240	Also, as somebody who's not really a part of the Twitch politics side of the internet,
128240	133360	when I first noticed that Vosh's website, VGG, was basically a carbon copy of Destiny's,
133360	137160	I figured that this was some sort of shared plugin system or drop and run setup that was
137160	138160	common among this community.
138160	141720	I don't know, is it called a GG site, is that what we're talking about here?
142600	144800	That's when I discovered what I thought was the source of these sites.
144800	149520	A service called White Leaf or White Forest, run by a person named White Nervosa.
149520	153680	Turns out, White Leaf is the type of website, White Forest is the company providing it,
153680	155400	and White Nervosa is the person.
155400	159560	White Forest is legally a worker co-op, with nine members, one member, one vote.
159560	163460	They operate White Leaf sites, as well as doing merch fulfillment, thanks to the financial
163460	164640	support of Vosh.
164640	168680	Their stated goal is to provide an accessible and independent platform for content creators.
168680	173080	And they do have an extensive list of reasonably high-profile leftist people they host.
173080	177520	The ones that I recognize personally are Vosh, Shuonhead, Kefls, Chrisraygun, The Surfs,
177520	182160	Dylan Burns, Konur, who is some femboy in Vosh's Polycule, Merrick, Xanderhal, The
182160	186800	Deer Girl, Demon Mama, and Counterpoints, who's actually a Burkean conservative, not
186800	187800	a leftist.
187800	191520	Which initially made me think this service might have been apolitical, just used primarily
191520	192520	by leftists.
192520	194680	But of course, that's actually not the case.
194680	198960	Although the White Forest company is kept afloat by patrons, it's also directly funded
198960	199960	by Vosh.
199960	204540	The fine print reads, no White Leaf users are necessarily affiliated with or endorsed
204540	207500	by White Nervosa or other members of White Forest.
207500	212320	The only content creators that pay White Forest are Vosh or those who choose to be a patron.
212320	215600	And then I noticed another interesting tidbit down there.
215600	220240	Website framework is a derivative work from DGG, Creative Commons Attribution, Share Like
220240	221240	3.0.
221240	222240	That's right!
222240	224640	DGG is not on the list of White Leaf sites.
224640	228680	DGG isn't a White Leaf site, all the White Leaf sites are ripoffs of DGG.
228680	231260	There's a fella in Destiny's community named Cake.
231260	232600	He does a lot of the tech work over there.
232600	235980	I've had a couple of casual conversations with him, nice guy, seems competent.
235980	238560	He put out a history of DGG to set the record straight.
238560	242760	The code behind DGG was open source and available for anyone to use, because Destiny wanted
242760	246440	other content creators to have something they could use for themselves to help bootstrap
246440	247440	their own careers.
247600	253400	In early 2019, White Nervosa took the DGG code and made a variant of it for Vosh, VGG,
253400	255540	which eventually became the White Leaf template.
255540	259840	There was actually early drama between Cake and White Nervosa, as Cake provided his assistants
259840	264140	believing his work was going towards White Nervosa's own site, not Vosh's site, or
264140	266600	to create a service for many other creators.
266600	269960	As somebody relatively new to this section of the internet, this stunned me.
269960	273680	How the hell was it that all of these people who hate Destiny have the gall to blatantly
273680	277680	rip off his site code, even going so far as to say Destiny's got nothing to do with
277680	278680	it?
278680	282700	Alright, here's where I would have subbed in that viral clip of Kefl's from last summer,
282700	286560	streaming during the opening of her own White Leaf site, KGG, where she made the claim that
286560	289880	her site was actually not ripped off from Destiny's and he had nothing to do with
289880	290880	it.
290880	292700	I remember seeing that clip all over the place back then.
292700	297280	It must have been retweeted back onto my timeline at least a few dozen times, but by January
297280	299680	2023, it seems to have vanished from the internet.
299680	301720	Ah well, I'm sure you all remember it.
301720	305340	It feels kind of like people trying to say that JK Rowling isn't the real creator of
305340	308800	Harry Potter now that her TERF views have come to light, or the Five Nights at Freddy's
308800	312080	guy doesn't count as the creator after it came out he was pro-life.
312080	313320	It's not hard to see how we got to this point.
313320	315440	I've done a lot of videos on this topic before.
315440	318760	Mindless consequentialism, truth is downstream from power, just make reality whatever serves
318760	320900	the politics, you know the story at this point.
320900	325200	Because of the volatility between Destiny and, like, all of the people using White Leaf
325200	327360	sites, this was obviously going to blow up eventually.
327360	330480	And it did, with the deplatforming of Rose Wriste.
330480	333280	Rose Wriste is some young Shoda kid who used to be a streamer.
333280	335360	I think he gave it up to go to school or something.
335360	340080	He's very progressive, very much a Nordic model kind of guy, but he is not a revolutionary
340080	341080	socialist.
341080	344420	During the Trump era, he and many others like him sided with the socialists online.
344420	349200	But post-Trump, Rose Wriste is another casualty on a long list of casualties from the internet's
349200	352060	socialist-slash-social-liberal split.
352060	355380	Rose Wriste helped Destiny with his huge manifesto on Kefls.
355380	359240	As far as I know, not in terms of digging up information, but in terms of grammar and
359240	362140	spell-checking, and also working over his logical inferences.
362140	365220	In other words, not on content, but on presentation and polish.
365220	369600	In response, Rose Wriste's White Leaf site, roserist.com, I think it was, was made to
369600	372920	redirect to the Drop Kiwi Farms site that Kefls put up.
372920	375840	Here's the DMs between Rose Wriste and White Nervosa.
375840	377160	Did you change my website?
377160	380840	White Forest has voted, worker co-op, remember, to discontinue servers to your site.
380840	382120	I wish you the best of luck.
382120	383360	Okay, I understand.
383360	386940	Can you then fully detach all your stuff from my purchased domain so that it's just a dead
386940	387940	link?
387940	388940	You own the domain.
388940	391940	I know that I'm not particularly adept when it comes to website stuff.
391940	395140	I could probably figure out how to disconnect it myself, but I just wanted to ask.
395140	399820	Cake charges $3,000 and then $150 a month for the services you were given.
399820	401420	You cannot ask me for help, no.
401420	405240	Okay, so to be clear, you won't even detach the stuff you've attached to my domain after
405240	406580	you decided to drop it?
406580	408280	To be clear, it is your domain.
408280	411700	If you don't understand that I can't detach it from my servers, that's not my problem.
411700	415020	Sure, but you're doing something to redirect it to Drop Kiwi Farms, right?
415020	416020	Good luck.
416020	417700	Thanks for all your help over the past two years.
417700	418700	I appreciate it.
419460	422740	Your words ring hollow, but I hope you grow to understand my position.
422740	424800	Here's the tech explanation of what's going on.
424800	428900	When you put in a website into your browser, Google.com for example, your computer communicates
428900	430500	with a domain name registrar.
430500	434780	Google owns the domain name Google.com, and the registrar links that domain with an IP
434780	439600	address, in this case 142.251.42.100.
439600	443300	If you were to type that set of numbers into your browser, you'd go to the Google homepage.
443300	448200	And believe it or not, in the very early internet, there was no domain names, only IP addresses.
448200	451800	You had to memorize which addresses led to which sites, like telephone numbers without
451800	452800	profiles attached.
452800	456760	So, the IP address is the number of a physical computer somewhere on the internet that hosts
456760	457760	the website.
457760	460600	And the domain name is a shorthand for that address, registered with the registrar.
460600	465340	Rose Wriste owns the domain name RoseWriste.com, and he asked his registrar to have it point
465340	468640	to the IP address of his White Leaf site hosted by White Forest.
468640	473400	But what White Nervosa did was have the IP address on White Forest's end redirect to
473400	475240	the Kefl's Drop Kiwi Farms page.
475240	479400	All Rose Wriste had to do to remedy the situation was to log in to his registrar and have it
479400	480740	point at a different IP.
480740	483960	But Rose Wriste, not being very tech-savvy, didn't know any of this.
483960	486280	Something that White Nervosa knew he was ignorant of.
486280	490320	That's why the only reply given when Rose Wriste asked, you're doing something to
490320	493200	redirect it to Drop Kiwi Farms, right, was, good luck.
493200	497160	No admission of guilt or innocence, no confirm or denial, just have fun figuring it out,
497160	498160	fuck you.
498160	501520	I should point out that Rose Wriste, like every other creator with White Forest, with
501520	504360	the exception of Vosh, didn't pay for a White Leaf site.
504360	507960	And White Nervosa retains the right to stop working with anyone at any time.
507960	511300	Nothing illegal has been done here, but it's certainly pretty scummy behavior, taking advantage
511300	513940	of Rose Wriste's ignorance on tech topics.
513940	518480	And eventually, Rose Wriste released a detailed manifesto describing his experience working
518480	522600	with White Forest, where it became clear that this wasn't the only scummy thing White
522600	523960	Nervosa had done.
523960	528320	Here is a list of 9 complaints Rose Wriste had regarding his time affiliated with White
528320	529320	Forest.
529320	530320	1.
530320	533800	He was not given an opportunity to make his case when White Forest voted to discontinue
534240	535240	2.
535240	537240	He was not even given notice that such a vote was happening
537240	538240	3.
538240	542240	He was not even given notice that services to his website had stopped and only found
542240	544080	out several days later 4.
544080	547880	He did not consent to White Forest and White Nervosa changing the server connected to his
547880	551560	domain to make it redirect to a website that they knew he was opposed to
551560	552560	5.
552560	554640	He was not given notice that this redirection was happening
554640	555640	6.
555640	558680	He was treated rudely by White Nervosa when he inquired into the changes
558680	559680	7.
559680	562360	He was publicly ridiculed for this interaction by White Nervosa
562360	563360	8.
563920	567440	He did not receive any follow-up regarding the handling of sensitive connections or information
567440	570560	of his or of the users who used his website 9.
570560	574720	He did not receive any assistance with resetting the DNS setting from White Nervosa who knew
574720	576440	he was incapable of doing so.
576440	580660	As a client of White Forest, you can, without notice or chance to defend yourself, have
580660	584140	your services discontinued, because the 9 members of the co-op have decided to vote
584140	586180	you out, and you won't even be told about it.
586180	589540	You can have your domain redirected to a website you are publicly opposed to.
589540	593180	You can be humiliated, publicly and privately, by White Nervosa herself.
593180	597100	You can be ignored when you ask about the handling of sensitive information stored on
597100	598100	the site.
598100	601540	And you can be left high and dry in trying to undo the damage they've caused.
601540	605700	White Forest's stated goal of providing an accessible and independent platform for
605700	609980	content creators seems to be a false one, at least if you happen to assist the guy who
609980	612720	originated the code they aped in the first place.
612720	616360	After this whole thing blew up and White Nervosa was dragged on Twitter for it, Rose Wriste
616360	619740	received an apology DM saying, I truly don't wish you deplatformed.
619740	620740	Yeah, alright.
620900	625420	Also, White Nervosa admitted to being drunk during the whole thing, which is, um, okay.
625420	628300	However, the apology only applied to the public ridiculing.
628300	630500	White Nervosa doubled down on everything else.
630500	634700	In one Twitter exchange, White Nervosa says, Rose Wriste agreed to our standard operating
634700	635700	procedure.
635700	639280	Is asked, is your standard operating procedure to redirect someone's domain name to a completely
639280	641860	different website they don't want to be affiliated with?
641860	646040	A White Nervosa supporter chimes in with, this is industry standard operating procedure.
646040	649540	When you suspend a service, it is not uncommon to redirect it to the provider's homepage
649540	654440	or a contextually relevant site, and is replied to with, the drop Kiwi Farms site is absolutely
654440	655980	not contextually relevant.
655980	660420	White Nervosa says, he called Kefles a terrorist for attempting to get Kiwi Farms taken down.
660420	662100	It is absolutely relevant.
662100	665600	What actually happened here is that at one point during the Kiwi Farms drama, Kefles
665600	670140	was pointing out that Kiwi Farms was hosted in Ukrainian server farm and then posted its
670140	675140	location, implying that Ukrainian partisans may want to attack it because Kiwi Farms hosts
675140	676420	Russian propaganda.
676420	681140	Destiny described this in his manifesto as calling for terroristic violence, the manifesto
681140	685020	that Rose Wriste edited for grammar and logic, and specifically not content.
685020	688500	To White Nervosa, this was Rose Wriste calling Kefles a terrorist.
688500	692740	The reply guy asks, so you're purposely redirecting his domain name to a website for a cause he
692740	695580	specifically doesn't agree with, and that's somehow morally okay to you?
695580	697700	And White Nervosa simply replies, yes.
697700	702220	White Nervosa also made a big dance around that standing operating procedure of theirs,
702220	705980	stating White Forest discontinues sites that have been inactive for more than 90 days.
705980	709380	When this happens, there is a default screen for if there's nothing to catch the URL.
709380	713020	Rose Wriste had passed the mark, handling over two dozen websites that wasn't a top
713020	714020	priority.
714020	718360	After he contributed to and endorsed a document calling for Cloudflare to protect Kiwi Farms,
718360	719420	it became a priority.
719420	720420	This was Sunday.
720420	723500	He didn't notice until Wednesday, which is when I acted poorly towards him.
723500	725180	I regret that and apologize.
725180	729020	Anybody who claims it's because he dared attack Kefles ignores that he streamed in
729020	730540	July critiquing Kefles.
730540	731540	This was not an issue.
731540	735120	You literally just mentioned one tweet ago that it was about the Kefles document.
736120	738880	Of course, people began to notice all the holes in this argument.
738880	742800	The dear gender person hadn't streamed in six months, but is still on White Forest.
742800	746080	White Nervosa replied, oh, it's because she's still getting automated donations.
746080	750240	This idea that Rose Wriste wasn't getting any automated donations is weird to me.
750240	754040	Rose was small but still doing well, well enough to have some automated subs or something.
754040	757800	But White Nervosa, who is the only one with access to the logs, stated, nope, Rose had
757800	762000	no donos, don't question it, even though Rose Wriste provided proof of many donations
762000	763000	during that time.
763000	767920	Moreover, Rose Wriste did in fact stream during the 90-day period, nine times, and you can
767920	771400	see the distinctive White Leaf chat overlay in those streams.
771400	774920	White Nervosa then claimed that Rose Wriste asked for a site to be deleted, which Rose
774920	779280	Wriste's own DMs disprove, and then finally claims that it actually is about Kefles, saying
779280	782600	it would not be brought back up assuming he maintained his endorsement.
782600	784760	Dude, at this point, just bite the bullet.
784760	787380	Say it was a power move and that you did it because you're in charge and you didn't
787380	789240	like what Rose Wriste did off platform.
789240	790520	We know that's why you did it.
790520	791720	You know that's why you did it.
791720	794560	All this dancing around just makes you look like even more of a fucking snake.
794560	798840	For a while, I believe that White Nervosa as a person was just a side story to the larger
798840	799840	Kefles drama.
799840	802800	A little extra bit of an intermission in between the real happenings.
802800	806280	But now, I think White Nervosa is actually a lolcow in her own right.
806280	809600	And the reason I've come to that conclusion is the Chud logic drama.
809600	811400	All the stuff with Rose Wriste was months ago.
811400	815040	It was involving White Nervosa's capacity at the head of a business, and it involved
815040	816040	Kefles.
816040	820400	But now, White Nervosa herself is just going nuts over literally nothing.
820400	821400	Let's check it out.
821400	823440	On January 17th, White Nervosa tweeted this.
823440	827040	I'm out of my mind, Chud logic, but is there any reason you're paying a person who felt
827040	828620	the need to tweet this twice?
828620	830640	Are you too lazy to find another editor?
830640	832840	Are they doing it for scraps off the plate so it's worth it?
832840	834320	Is there no connection you feel?
834320	838520	This is in response to DriftKingEdits, also known as DK, Chud's editor, tweeting the
838520	840140	following in quick succession.
840140	843480	Not really sure what's going on, but Andrew Callahan definitely didn't rape that young
843480	844480	lady.
844480	847880	Followed by, not really sure what's going on, but Andrew Callahan definitely raped that
847880	848880	young lady.
848880	851800	Now, I'm not really sure what's going on with Andrew Callahan, but I'm pretty sure
851800	852800	this is a joke.
852800	855020	It's literally the cover all your bases thing.
855020	858420	And White Nervosa was offended by it, to the point that she went to Chud logic and did
858420	860960	the cancel culture, why is he your editor thing.
860960	864960	Chud's response was to point out that while White Nervosa is tagging him into the tweet,
864960	868440	making it look like to her followers that she's inviting him to have a conversation,
868440	870000	she's actually got him blocked.
870000	872480	He can't see it, so it looks like he's ducking her.
872480	877120	But he replied anyway, simply saying, I will never kowtow to the gay retarded sensibilities
877120	880920	of leftoids based, always reject the struggle session.
880920	882720	The Twitter canceling attempt went nowhere.
882720	886640	So White Nervosa took it a step further by reporting Chud's Twitch channel to Twitch
886640	889000	because he called her a gay retard on Twitter.
889000	893480	And even though Twitch's off platform policies can be kind of ridiculous, even they weren't
893480	895380	ridiculous enough to take this bait.
895380	899520	Twitch has explicitly told me that it's okay that the partner Chud logic has called me
899520	901740	another partner, a gay retard.
901740	905440	Take that as you will and do as you wish off platform, as long as it's not an imminent
905440	906440	threat.
906440	910160	Yeah, Twitch's off service conduct policy states that Twitch will ban you if you do
910160	912000	any of the following off platform.
912000	913000	1.
913000	915880	Engage in deadly violence or terrorism or terroristic recruiting.
915880	916880	2.
916880	918880	Explicit and or credible threats of mass violence.
918880	919880	3.
919880	921760	Explicit and or credible threats against Twitch.
921760	922760	4.
922760	925040	Leadership, membership, sponsorship of a known hate group.
925040	926040	5.
926040	928360	Carrying out or acting as an accomplice to sexual assault.
928360	929360	6.
929360	930360	Sexual exploitation of youth.
930360	931360	7.
931360	933080	Compromising the physical safety of the Twitch community.
933080	934080	8.
934080	935080	Harmful misinformation.
935080	939080	And any of this stuff applied to Chud logic calling White Nervosa a gay retard.
939080	942480	It's not terrorism or violence, it's not a credible threat, it's not membership
942480	945840	in a hate group unless you count the Chud nation, it's not sexual assault or exploiting
945840	950040	youth or threatening the safety of Twitch, and perhaps most explicitly of all, it's
950040	951560	not misinformation either.
951560	955040	White Nervosa continued to complain about Twitch refusing to take action on offsite
955040	956460	behavior beyond what's listed.
956460	960560	And the reason why is explicitly because she wants Chud logic deplatformed.
960560	964240	Hey, and like with Rose Wriste, at least she has the balls to say it directly this time.
964240	967680	Or maybe it's because Chud's an easier target among leftoids than Rose Wriste was.
967680	968680	Who knows.
968680	972100	Chud's reply was to call White Nervosa a disgusting freak who has no problems with
972100	975800	abusing power and is now making a concerted effort to deplatform him.
975800	979840	White Nervosa mocks the concerted effort bit by saying she sent one email and she actually
979840	980840	doesn't really care.
980840	984120	Despite, of course, being the one who started the Nothing Burger and pushing her followers
984120	985120	to go at it.
985120	989880	Chud's editor, DK, returned to write a lengthy anime villain post about how basically, White
989880	993840	Nervosa is a fraud hack who will fade away because everything she's ever done that's
993840	997520	noteworthy has been stolen by others and the next wave of innovation will be the end
997520	998680	of her 15 minutes of fame.
998680	1002240	The backlash White Nervosa received from all of this nonsense was enough to make her leave
1002240	1003380	Twitter for a few days.
1003380	1004380	But only a few.
1004380	1006040	These people always come back eventually.
1006040	1010000	White Nervosa is also a moderator for Vaush's community, though she may be on a break from
1010000	1011000	that position for a while.
1011000	1012000	She's friends with him.
1012000	1013000	She still runs his site.
1013000	1014000	She gets paid by him.
1014000	1015240	And was a mod for a long time.
1015240	1019920	While White Nervosa was offline, some other Vaush mod, Thena, publicly continued the crusade
1019920	1022880	in her place, repeating the calls for Twitch to ban Chud.
1022920	1027320	But more notably, she went into Vaush's community and began petitioning Vaush viewers to join
1027320	1032720	in on the dogpile, saying that Chud is violating his Twitch partner contract by harassing her
1032720	1034200	over her gender identity.
1034200	1036200	Excuse me, but where the fuck did this happen?
1036200	1039200	Come on, you really think you can just go on the internet and make shit up?
1039200	1044320	Afterward, Thena banned Chud from VGG and the Vaush subreddit, as well as a bunch of
1044320	1048400	other people who aren't even in these communities but have publicly spoken out against White
1048400	1052640	Nervosa, most notably Stardust, who's been laughing at all this nonsense on her stream.
1053400	1056240	Now, these people have the right to run their shitty little communities however they like.
1056240	1060280	But this is just like 2015, 2016 all over again, where the leftoids won't tolerate
1060280	1064120	anybody who disagrees with them even a little bit and will go scorched earth on everyone
1064120	1065120	who steps out of line.
1065120	1066760	And I'm not being hyperbolic.
1066760	1070120	There was also the White Nervosa deny milkshakes drama.
1070120	1072440	Deny milkshakes is some other flavor of leftist.
1072440	1074120	These people always eat each other.
1074120	1076840	And last fall, these two nobodies were at war.
1076840	1081560	Deny milkshakes said Japanese nuclear bombings were genocidal terror apologia and he would
1081560	1084360	block anyone who was partisan in favor of the bombings.
1084360	1088520	Nervosa replied, calling him indistinguishable from a tanky and that he was making light
1088520	1089880	of the Holocaust.
1089880	1093360	Just so we're clear, there's a reason that socialists look at every other socialist
1093360	1095760	except themselves and see fascists.
1095760	1100640	White Nervosa, a totally sane person, replied to deny milkshakes by threatening to, if he
1100640	1105640	did not agree to a streamed debate with her, block him, block his followers, and punish
1105640	1109360	everyone using White Forest by deplatforming all of them.
1109360	1110360	Well, hold on there.
1110360	1112280	I thought this was a worker co-op, White Nervosa.
1112280	1115960	I thought you needed a vote of the nine crumbtubers who run the whole thing in order to be able
1115960	1117280	to do something like this.
1117280	1122120	This is how the leftoid worker democracy always degenerates into an authoritarian shithole,
1122120	1123120	by the way.
1123120	1126600	It's always because another leftist disagrees with them and they can't accept disunity
1126600	1127700	among the proles.
1127700	1132320	The backlash to this event was severe, way more than anything related to tread logic,
1132320	1135820	to the point that White Nervosa scrubbed the internet of it in an effort to get people
1135820	1137280	to forget it ever happened.
1137280	1139120	But the internet never forgets.
1139120	1141360	And get a load at what the internet remembered.
1141360	1146600	To be more specific, they said they were okay with Kefl's, Xanderhal, Roserist, Vosch,
1146600	1150880	Marek, and several others being deplatformed because they refused to have a conversation
1150880	1152960	about calling me a genocide apologist.
1152960	1153960	Are you serious, bitch?
1153960	1155960	You were the one with the finger on the off switch.
1155960	1157680	This is nobody else's fault but your own.
1157680	1161580	Why in the fuck would you ever get yourself a White Leaf site when the dictator running
1161580	1165360	the whole operation can nuke you off the internet simply because she got into a Twitter
1165360	1167720	spat with a random person you don't even know?
1167720	1171440	Now this whole thing so far has just been lame twitter drama.
1171440	1174700	And if it were only lame twitter drama, it wouldn't really be worth it for me to do
1174700	1175700	a video on it.
1175700	1179400	I enjoy watching Chud and Stardust dream about it, it's pretty fun to watch petty drama
1179400	1180400	sometimes.
1180400	1183920	But my personal interest on its own isn't enough for me to make a video on the topic.
1183920	1187640	What I discovered after digging into White Nervosa myself, though, was...
1187640	1189520	Let's start at the surface level stuff.
1189520	1214760	Check out Vosha's comments on this shitshow.
1214760	1227300	Hold on, pause it right here.
1227300	1229840	Look who posted that Xanderhal tweet in Vosha's chat.
1229840	1231280	Oh, it's Xanderhal!
1231280	1234480	The only guy who would ever actually post a Xanderhal tweet anywhere.
1234480	1235960	He's literally doing the tattletale thing.
1235960	1239520	And if you look around online, you'll find a lot of these crumbtubers all trying to pile
1239520	1241720	on Chud and trying to get Vosha to come out against him.
1241720	1243600	You gotta cancel Chud logic, guys.
1243600	1245320	Vosha's reply, though, is kind of anemic.
1245320	1247440	On the one hand, he doesn't seem to care too much about this stuff.
1247440	1250640	But on the other, he's completely fine with his mods behaving this way.
1250640	1252460	Now, I personally don't think that's a problem.
1252460	1256320	What my mods do outside of the context of my community isn't any of my business, and
1256320	1258320	I extend that chariability to everyone.
1258320	1260520	But that's not the rules the progs use.
1260520	1265800	These people are losing their marbles over what DK does and how Chud is obviously co-signing
1265800	1267500	it all by continuing to employ him.
1267500	1272980	So by that standard, Vosha is a worse person because of White Nervosa's terrible behavior.
1272980	1275060	And the Chud deplatforming is just the tip of the iceberg.
1275060	1279340	It's also how, while trying to get Chud deplatformed, they cry that any pushback they
1279340	1281020	receive is harassment.
1281020	1284820	This is literally the Jani cries out in pain as she strikes you.
1284820	1289040	These people cry about body positivity and bigotry and trans-nonsense while at the same
1289040	1291940	time using low testosterone as an insult.
1291940	1295520	These people were the ones who face-doxed Chud logic in the first place.
1295520	1298940	These people were the ones who thought it was a good idea to try and cover up Vosha's
1298940	1300860	sexual harassment allegations.
1300860	1305340	White Nervosa and her White Forest crowd are the gang of people who do the on-the-ground
1305340	1309900	work of following around leftist streamers, most commonly Vosh, and cleaning up their
1309900	1314420	messes, while serving as relentless attack dogs against anyone who dares to cross their
1314420	1315660	parasocial daddies.
1315660	1316660	Let's rewind.
1316660	1318660	January 26th, 2018.
1318660	1323860	Over a year before White Nervosa took the open-source DGG code and made a closed for-profit
1323860	1324860	fork of it.
1324860	1327860	She was a member of Destiny's community, no surprise there, and debated him on the
1327860	1328860	topic of deplatforming.
1328860	1332780	I can't believe we're here, five years later, having the same fucking conversations.
1332780	1336360	This stream actually isn't too spicy, and there's not one clip that I can pull out
1336360	1338060	to explicitly prove what I'm saying.
1338060	1340640	It's the tone of the thing, you kinda have to watch it for yourself.
1340640	1344980	White Nervosa is clearly trying to nudge Destiny to the left throughout the conversation, with
1344980	1349040	the general tenor of the conversation being, well, these rightoids are idiots, so you should
1349040	1350860	be agreeing more with us leftoids, right?
1350860	1352940	And Destiny, to his credit, doesn't take the bait.
1352940	1358260	I need a criterion by which I can deplatform somebody that I can objectively argue for,
1358260	1359420	which is difficult.
1359420	1363820	The big problem with me for deplatforming is that, to deplatform somebody, it almost
1363820	1370420	feels like you're saying, my philosophy is objectively superior to yours, because what
1370420	1374120	I need is I need an argument by which I can deplatform another that wouldn't allow me
1374120	1376420	to get deplatformed, because I wouldn't want to be deplatformed, right?
1376420	1382740	So how would society deplatform people, like, if society were to do it?
1382740	1386780	For example, Twitter would deplatform people by, if you share fake news or something, like,
1386980	1387980	these would be my criterion, right?
1387980	1391500	Like, if you post lies or something like that, you'd be deplatformed on Twitter or something,
1391500	1393140	they would ban your accounts or something like that.
1393140	1393900	I don't know.
1393900	1397220	You'd have to be very rigid and very specific in your set of criteria.
1397220	1402740	For somebody like Warski, like, how is he supposed to platform somebody responsibly?
1402740	1406860	Like, what would he do to actually not be a Nazi?
1406860	1412620	Oh, so I'm not even on that, like, platforming people responsibly?
1412620	1414620	Like, I, maybe.
1414620	1417660	I don't know if Andy's, like, if you bring on a bunch of Nazis and you don't challenge
1417660	1421140	their opinion, I don't consider that to be falling under the purview of what I would
1421140	1422300	be going after.
1422300	1428300	It would be going after people who are intentionally or with gross negligence or recklessness spreading
1428300	1429300	fake news.
1429300	1432500	That would be, like, my starting ground, and that's the only part that I'm at right now.
1432500	1436500	So, like, if somebody wants to come on and argue, like, listen, I want to create an ethno-state,
1436500	1439860	I want to get all the blacks and all the Mexicans out of here, like, fine, that's fine.
1439860	1442540	That person gets a platform, they can argue their shit, I love free speech.
1442540	1444140	It's a goddamn beautiful thing.
1444140	1447260	But if that guy wants to get up and make that argument by spreading a bunch of bullshit
1447260	1451620	news around, by linking to fucking Breitbart articles that have bullshit sources, by quoting
1451620	1455260	headlines and sniping data and not really making an honest argument, fuck that guy.
1455260	1456260	Take him out.
1456260	1461100	So when you say Worsky doesn't, or he's irresponsibly platforming people, should he not be allowed
1461100	1462900	to carry on that platform, or?
1462900	1466340	Oh, no, Andy can, um, Andy can platform whoever he wants.
1466340	1468260	I just don't like that he doesn't acknowledge the reality of it.
1468260	1470260	I mean, if he, I don't think it should be, like, illegal.
1470260	1471260	Oh, yeah, now it's an immoral issue.
1471260	1472260	Yeah, yeah.
1472260	1473260	One.
1473380	1481380	Right, I feel like, though, like, um, some countries really, like, yeah, I feel like
1481380	1488780	America has a good freedom of press, freedom of speech, and you don't think that any other
1488780	1495740	country should adopt, or rather, reverse, you don't think we should adopt any of the...
1495740	1499700	I don't know, like, shit like the Germany shit, like, makes me pretty wary, like, that
1499700	1502180	you can't even do, like, that hail Hitler salute, or you can get in trouble, you can
1502180	1503180	get fined for that.
1503180	1505180	Why does that make you weary?
1505180	1508300	I don't know, because I, fuck, if I want to go outside and do the hail Hitler salute,
1508300	1509820	I don't want to get in trouble by the state.
1509820	1511140	It's fucking crazy to me.
1511140	1512180	Fuck that shit.
1512180	1514180	I'm a free goddamn American.
1514180	1518780	Well, you're a free American who supports responsible platforming.
1518780	1524060	Yeah, but supporting responsible platforming doesn't mean that I explicitly or implicitly
1524060	1527140	support, like, throwing people in jail for shit.
1527140	1531620	Well, wait, there is a, there's a thing where, like, a line that, irresponsible, irresponsibly
1532220	1534140	speech could get you thrown in prison.
1534140	1540260	I don't agree with that, unless it's literally, like, direct calls to harm or something.
1540260	1541260	How indirect could you get?
1541260	1543260	I don't fucking know.
1543260	1544260	It's up to the courts to decide.
1544260	1549340	Like, if there was a, if there was a march, and they chanted, kill all Jews, or killed
1549340	1552580	the Jews, is that direct, or?
1552580	1554460	That sounds pretty direct to me, yeah, sure.
1554460	1558580	Anytime you're saying kill, and then something, it's probably over the line, right?
1558580	1561580	Yeah, no, yeah, that makes sense.
1561580	1562580	Yeah.
1562580	1565060	So what's your opinion of hate speech laws?
1565060	1567500	I don't know, I would have to think really hard about it.
1567500	1569580	My gut tells me that I think they're bad.
1569580	1574220	I feel like the hate speech laws are there to give that pre-, not necessarily preemptive
1574220	1581700	strike, but, like, when speeches basically kill all, kill all of, you know, this group.
1581700	1582700	Mm-hmm.
1582700	1585820	I think, I think that's why the hate speech laws are there, because they're not necessarily
1585820	1589780	a threat towards any one person, but what do you charge them with otherwise?
1589780	1592820	I mean, if that's what you mean by hate speech, like, just, like, directly threatening somebody,
1592820	1596180	then I'm probably- Well, no, no, right, it's, it's, it's more
1596180	1598940	broad than just that, but- Sure.
1598940	1603140	I think it covers a lot of, um, areas that need to be covered.
1603140	1607140	Why aren't you a socialist?
1607140	1608140	I love capitalism.
1608140	1614260	Why can't you have a capitalist market system under socialist means?
1614260	1617620	I mean, doesn't capitalism also speak to things like labor and whatnot?
1617620	1620660	Which, and it doesn't let all that labor and everything work fundamentally differently
1620660	1621660	in a socialist system?
1621660	1629260	Sure, but wouldn't labor be more, um, well, couldn't unions be a form of-
1629260	1634220	Um, but unions don't oftentimes- Well, hold on, I have to think about whether or not,
1634220	1636780	do unions represent market power or not?
1636780	1640120	Um, basically, whenever I ask, whenever I think about a question like this, what I'm
1640120	1642660	trying to think of is, is there a market failure?
1642660	1646340	And if there's a market failure, I'm always okay with, with some sort of government intervention,
1646340	1647340	right?
1647340	1650300	So, just to trigger x skills me in the, in the chat, something like net neutrality, I
1650300	1654580	would consider the, um, the natural, the, the ISP's being prone to being naturalistic
1654580	1657080	monopolies, I would consider that a form of market failure.
1657080	1660260	And market failures, I think, should always be remedied by some sort of government policy.
1660260	1665380	So, would a company being too big to have any threat of, of unionizing happen, and where
1665380	1666380	no other companies could compete?
1666380	1669280	I mean, if that market failure existed, then yeah, I would be okay with remedying that
1669280	1670280	with government shit.
1670280	1671280	Does that make sense?
1672280	1673280	Yeah, that makes sense.
1673280	1674280	Yeah.
1674280	1676880	Um, a lot of people in chat are bringing up that they live in countries where the lines
1676880	1679280	are shared and, and ISPs have to rent the lines.
1679280	1683560	I mean, like, that seems like the reasonable thing for me, like, it's, it's infrastructure
1683560	1686600	that the whole city should care about because pretty much everybody has internet, so I'm
1686600	1688160	okay publicly paying for it.
1688160	1691200	We want to keep the lines running well, and then an ISP can open a data center and they
1691200	1694280	can run, you know, they can hook up at the last, you know, towards them.
1697680	1698680	Yeah, yeah.
1699080	1701680	So, so do you think U.S. should go in that direction?
1701680	1702680	We should start at least.
1702680	1703680	Probably.
1703680	1704680	Yeah.
1706680	1709680	Well, well, you sounded really hesitant there, buddy.
1709680	1712180	Well, because everything, everything is informed, everything is informed by the data.
1712180	1716180	I don't know, like, if, if, if shit turns bad, then no, but like, that seems like a
1716180	1720180	good, a good thing to me, I think.
1720180	1723520	That seems like a good direction forward, but maybe there, there might be a better argument
1723520	1727000	against it, but yeah, because I don't, I don't know what the argument would be for having
1727000	1729000	independent lines or everybody owning their own lines or whatever.
1729000	1731400	It just seems like a huge fucking waste.
1731400	1733780	There's nothing really too bombastic in this video.
1733780	1734780	No big blowout.
1734780	1739000	White Nervosa just kind of meekly says, okay, after getting pushed back every single time.
1739000	1742360	It feels like she wants to pull him to the left, but also doesn't want to jeopardize
1742360	1743560	her connection to him.
1743560	1746240	Some of you might be saying, Dev, you're reading into this way too much.
1746240	1747720	How can you possibly know that?
1747720	1751780	Well, I know it because of a conversation that White Nervosa had with Vosh on her channel
1751780	1756320	a year later on March 12th, 2019 titled, um, to kill cops.
1756320	1759900	This is White Nervosa's first encounter with Vosh, and it's from this meeting that becoming
1759900	1762960	a moderator and creating his website with the forked code that would eventually become
1762960	1764340	White Leaf would spring.
1764340	1766480	There's a few interesting things in this conversation.
1766480	1771520	One, White Nervosa and Vosh both consider liberals, fascists, centrists, and rightists
1771520	1772800	to all be the same thing.
1772800	1776920	Kind of like how some rightoids think that all liberals, socialists, centrists, and leftists
1776920	1778040	are the same thing as well.
1778040	1780120	It's just centrism, right?
1780120	1783960	It's just the typical centrist, right?
1783960	1791920	That's just like, like until they die, you know, both sides are radical and both sides
1791920	1796680	are equal and both sides need to come together.
1796680	1800440	Even though one side is literally Nazis.
1800440	1801440	Yeah.
1801440	1805720	Um, I mean, that sounds like some of the centrists that I've discussed in the past.
1805720	1808800	It is, it is fucking incredible to me.
1808800	1814160	It's amazing how, um, how subjective centrism is these days.
1814160	1819640	Um, Nazism sure is closer to the center than I, uh, than I originally interpreted.
1819640	1820640	Yeah.
1820640	1821640	Like, holy shit.
1821640	1824920	I just can't even tokens like Dave Rubin, right?
1824920	1827520	Like he's a liberal, right?
1827520	1831200	And like these are his talking points and the same thing with Candace Owens and the
1831200	1836160	same thing with Ben Shapiro and the same thing with, um, yeah, like it just goes on and on.
1836200	1839880	But yeah, like I think like the biggest problem is people don't perceive how like harmful
1839880	1844400	it is to public discourse and like centrism is fucking cancer for that.
1844400	1851080	Just the ignorance of like, uh, the Overton window and again, like crypto fascism and
1851080	1852920	I mean, I don't like, I don't know.
1852920	1855200	Like I fucking hate, I fucking hate him.
1855200	1858360	I hate him so goddamn much, fascists and centrists.
1858360	1859360	I don't know.
1859360	1860360	I don't know how to improve.
1860360	1861360	It just doesn't make any sense.
1861760	1867840	Cause I feel like every demonstrable study shows like, like these are, this is supposed
1867840	1869840	to be the facts over feels crowd.
1869840	1872960	Nope, centrists have never read a study in their entire life.
1872960	1874640	You can drop that right now.
1874640	1877840	None of them have ever read a single study.
1877840	1882480	Like centrists will acknowledge like psychological pitfalls, but then like they always fall back
1882480	1887920	on this weird, like, so, so it is like they are still right wing because they still always
1887920	1890480	fall back onto individual like responsibility.
1890480	1896360	Like, like, like for fascism, I view the only means is violence.
1896360	1898840	You can only defeat fascism with violence, right?
1898840	1901200	There is no argument.
1901200	1906760	There's no, like, like the centrist will always be drifted towards fascism.
1906760	1911600	So the only way to combat it is to dissuade fascists from protesting.
1911600	1913360	So you have to hit them with violence.
1917920	1921760	Does not exist in America because there is no revolutionary movement and how they want
1921760	1922760	to be a part of one.
1922760	1924200	I think like, I don't fucking know.
1924200	1927000	Like what makes a person want to be centrist?
1927000	1931200	Is it they, they were like a conservative, but conservatism is a cool because the average
1931200	1933560	age of Republican in America is 900.
1933560	1936920	So they want to be like the edgy fucking libertarian centrist.
1936920	1941680	Is it because they once went to a college campus and they think they're kind of liberal
1941680	1946360	and then like some, a woman with blue hair yelled at them and now they're assuming like
1946360	1947640	I don't, I don't know.
1947640	1951800	Whatever it is, it stems from ignorance or stupidity or fear.
1951800	1954440	It's like, like a little bit of just stunning Kruger, right?
1954440	1959160	They, they just know like a little bit about politics and they think they know so much.
1959160	1964960	Like they think they see like the extreme left and the extreme right, but like they've
1964960	1970200	just made this like fossil equivocation that just doesn't exist.
1970200	1972400	Like there is no extreme left.
1972400	1976280	We will become the extreme left and we will stride across this great land, um, seize the
1976280	1977440	means of production.
1977440	1978440	You know?
1978440	1979440	Oh yeah.
1979440	1980440	Yeah.
1980440	1981440	Okay.
1981440	1982440	Yeah.
1982440	1983440	Let's well, yeah.
1983440	1987200	I mean, you know, I mean, I'd say like, you know, the car was going down the wrong street
1987200	1991240	and you know, Charlottesville, you know, it's just White, Nervosa and Vosh talk about how
1991240	1995560	while a far left party winning elections would be ideal, a revolutionary movement of working
1995560	1999600	class people, uh, storming the seat of government is also good too.
1999600	2000600	As long as they're leftist.
2000600	2005180	Of course, I think we need at least another century, maybe a century and a half of class
2005180	2009160	consciousness spreading amongst the pros before we're ready to have a revolution.
2009160	2014700	And when it happens, I would like it to happen in conjunction with a far left political party
2014700	2020520	gaining prominence in the legislator, which would be able to secure a clean transition
2020520	2026380	of power rather than the literal like citizens up revolt against the entire United States
2026380	2030700	military storming Washington, taking control of the, uh, oval office.
2030700	2036380	Um, you know, broadcasting a message of victory to the rest of the American people.
2036380	2042380	I hope that in the future, the material circumstances eventually arrive at a point where, um, where
2042380	2044300	they feel revolution is possible.
2044300	2045300	They're okay.
2045300	2050340	If police die during this uprising, I presume you're not in favor of outlawing armor piercing
2050340	2051340	bullets.
2051340	2052340	Fuck that.
2052340	2056080	The only people who wear armor are cops.
2056080	2066520	They're hoping for a revolution that may occur in more than a century, but in the meantime,
2066520	2069400	we have bullets designed explicitly to kill cops.
2069400	2070920	Oh, I mean, yeah.
2070920	2072640	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2072640	2076200	Just because I advocate for a revolution in the future doesn't mean I'm not okay with
2076200	2077920	cop killing now.
2077920	2081480	But at the same time, they also don't want individuals to actually own guns.
2081480	2086060	They want the guns to be owned by the community and kept in a community armory, which is just
2086060	2089060	the state owning all the guns again with a new label attached.
2089060	2091540	But ideally I wouldn't like guns to be kept in the house.
2091540	2098220	I would like there to be like, uh, community armories, um, that neighborhoods would have
2098220	2102740	where like, if there was ever a need to, uh, you could go to this like sort of collectively
2102740	2107380	owned bunker maintained by the community and you've got your fucking mousins and F4s and
2107380	2108380	shit.
2108380	2114380	For rebranding, I think like, uh, you could pitch it as just a shooting range, right?
2114380	2117440	Like you can even own like a automatic weapons, right?
2117440	2121660	Just lock them up at the shooting range and then you go grenade launchers.
2121660	2123120	Absolutely own that shit.
2123120	2124120	Grenade launchers.
2124120	2125860	I want the fucking anti-tank mines.
2125860	2131060	I want the God, I want the sniper rifles that can penetrate, um, police, uh, car doors.
2131060	2132060	I want all that shit.
2132060	2133220	I want them stock block.
2133220	2134580	I want the fucking barrel.
2134580	2139460	I want the barrel, the chamber loaded as you pick up the gun.
2139460	2140740	I want us to be ready.
2140740	2144820	They also have no real concern with what happens after the revolution either, as long as it
2144820	2147380	moves the world ever more leftward.
2147380	2152100	Is your end game to abolish the state wholesale?
2152100	2155020	I don't really care what happens after we overthrow capitalism.
2155020	2158260	The material circumstances of the time will dictate what comes next.
2158260	2160920	I just want to see us move forward, move leftward.
2160920	2163460	And by the way, they don't believe that democracy can do this.
2163460	2168300	I reject the idea that electoralism is the means by which we can overthrow the hold police
2168300	2170320	have on disenfranchised communities.
2170320	2174720	And finally, White, Nervosa and Vashj describe hiding their true beliefs and subverting this
2174720	2175720	system from the outside.
2175720	2178800	Like, couldn't you like falsely moralize that to yourself though?
2178800	2182720	Because I feel like I could very easily fall into that like psychological trap where I
2182720	2190280	could like moralize myself or, you know, say that I'm not doing tangible harm to public
2190280	2191280	discourse.
2191280	2196280	I'm just doing it for a paycheck to feed my family and to further like my own personal
2196280	2197280	goals.
2197280	2201840	I don't know if I could justify it ethically under my own like personal set of values,
2201840	2207720	but I do know, I think the only way that I could come away from that thinking like, okay,
2207720	2211200	maybe I'm not going to blow my brains out in this gas station bathroom.
2211200	2218320	The only way I could come out feeling like I'm not doing that is if I thought like, okay,
2218320	2223720	I'm building power from within, but one day I will unveil my true power level.
2223720	2227160	Personally on a personal level, I do not think that I could do it unless I had some
2227160	2231560	sort of like secret underlying motive, some way in which I felt I was actually supporting
2231560	2232720	the leftist cause.
2232720	2234800	I understand how other people could do it though.
2234800	2241880	Not everyone is as politically enfranchised as you or I have such strongly formed opinions,
2241880	2244000	such a firm understanding of theory.
2244000	2249640	The most refreshing part of all of this is seeing a more mask off Vashj than he is nowadays.
2249640	2258520	So then if you believe that Republicans have intent right now to bring about an LGBT genocide,
2258520	2263720	how can you morally object against people right now taking arms and going out and killing
2263720	2264960	Republican lawmakers?
2264960	2265960	Exactly.
2265960	2266960	Republican lawmakers?
2266960	2267960	Yes.
2267960	2271000	Well, it would be a utilitarian thing, wouldn't it?
2271000	2273000	Oh God, stop.
2273000	2274000	Stop.
2274000	2278000	Which unfortunately I don't really think it's possible to know that because I'm not God,
2278000	2281040	but as a general rule, that type of thing doesn't tend to work out.
2281040	2282040	But there are plenty of examples-
2282040	2290580	Ask him this, if it did work out, if they were able to kill lawmakers with no consequences,
2290580	2294000	would it be morally justified, question mark?
2294000	2295640	You know, are a legitimate-
2295640	2296640	Ask him.
2296640	2297640	Let's hear it.
2297640	2298640	Make him answer our question.
2298640	2302080	... are trying to use that power to suppress minority groups.
2302080	2303680	You talked about the utilitarian thing before.
2303680	2309360	So if it would be possible, if it were to be possible to get away with killing Republican
2309360	2311880	lawmakers with no consequences, would it then be-
2311880	2313840	Are you actually fed posting at me right now?
2313840	2314840	You're glowing in this convo.
2314840	2315840	Wait, are you being fed these questions?
2315840	2317240	Ah, he won't answer that question.
2317240	2318240	I knew he wouldn't.
2318240	2319400	I knew he wouldn't answer that question.
2319400	2320440	He won't do it.
2320440	2321440	He won't do it.
2321440	2323960	What a fucking weaselly little coward.
2323960	2327200	2023, Vosh is too scared to say what he really thinks.
2327200	2329700	He likes the Twitch bucks too much, so he hides his power level.
2329700	2331340	And Vosh on IRL panels?
2331340	2332340	Forget it.
2332340	2334700	The milk toast progressive opinions you can imagine.
2334700	2337820	If you look at any major social movement, you will see disinformation.
2337820	2341780	That was the case with BLM, that was the case with the civil rights movement, the suffragette
2341780	2345620	movement, the abolitionist movement, the American revolution, and everything prior to it.
2345620	2347300	Misinformation is just a part and parcel.
2347300	2351100	If you try to minimize it, but at the end of the day, it is something that will be produced
2351100	2352700	and sometimes focused on.
2352700	2356660	You have to take a look at the underlying social motivations and the processes that
2356660	2357660	led to that.
2357660	2362140	So with regards to the January 6th stuff, again, you can, as you said, normalize very
2362140	2366000	terrible stuff with the wrong descriptive understanding of the world.
2366000	2371700	You can take just about every heinous totalitarian ideology that's ever festered on this planet,
2371700	2375960	you know, whether you want to go Nazism or Stalinist, Pol Pot, wherever you want to go.
2375960	2381460	If you fed a person the right set of facts about the world, big air quotes, by the way,
2381460	2384940	you could approximate those ideologies in them.
2384940	2388120	Compare that take to this one and you'll see exactly what I mean.
2388120	2391900	There is not a good base of conservatives in this country.
2391900	2394240	These people are no different from the Ku Klux Klan.
2394240	2399220	They are no different from the fucking white nationalists who ran terror campaigns in the
2399220	2401560	South back during the 1920s, 30s, 40s.
2401560	2405780	They are absolutely no different from the frothing at the mouth screaming fucking pasty
2405780	2410380	male people who are throwing rocks at black folk going to integrated schools.
2410380	2411780	There is no difference.
2411780	2415400	If you have a conservative family member, I'm sorry, they're part of the problem.
2415400	2418100	If you have a conservative friend, I'm sorry, they're part of the problem.
2418100	2420760	History will crush these people beneath its feet.
2420760	2424400	Every single time a political party has tried this shit, every single time they've gone
2424400	2428480	down this road, they have been reviled through the generations.
2428480	2431020	There is no good history for these people.
2431020	2434560	And every conservative, every Republican is on the hook for this.
2434560	2435800	Every last one of them.
2435800	2439620	These people present one view when they're in real life and being challenged directly
2439620	2444200	and another view entirely when they feel like only their community, their people are watching
2444200	2446480	and they're safe from the eyes of outsiders.
2446480	2449640	They are just as subversive as the fascists they claim to oppose.
2449640	2451840	They tell the big lie just as much.
2451840	2455360	They too hide their real politics until the moment is right.
2455360	2459280	Three, stemming from their subversiveness, White-Nervosa and Vosch both admit that the
2459280	2463640	reason they hang around destiny is to convert him to their political beliefs and to pull
2463640	2466040	his audience into their sphere of influence.
2466040	2473080	I've seen like, yeah, you go toe to toe with destiny on economics and I kind of accidentally
2473080	2478760	push him further away because I pushed him towards getting rid of minimum wage.
2479280	2481280	Oh no.
2481280	2486640	I think, I honestly, the best way to radicalize destiny and leftward is to, if you're a leftist,
2486640	2492560	is to not talk with him because he gets really fucking angry and defensive talking to leftists.
2492560	2497000	I feel, I almost feel for him because he, he's like, cause he's a lib boy, you know,
2497000	2505080	he's a good old lib guy and, and because he gets popular debating on these idiot right-wingers,
2505080	2507560	he'll like sort of throw him in with the lefties.
2507560	2512000	But now he feels like this performative need to distance himself from them so he can stand
2512000	2517320	alone on his own little, like, yeah, yeah, he definitely loves, like it, it's almost
2517320	2522680	like a virtue signal, like that he loves to like say like, oh man, I guess you're a communist,
2522680	2523680	right?
2523680	2529400	Like, like, like, uh, in a condescending way in a discussion, um, we'll get them one day.
2529400	2530400	Yeah.
2530400	2536360	I mean, well, I, I feel like, like, like, again, like just by accident, right?
2536360	2543640	Just by him, I mean, cause fuck, he used to be a libertarian, so he's on the right track.
2543640	2545720	He just has to get there.
2545720	2549640	White Nervosa also decries the equivalence between the radical left and the radical right
2549640	2553840	as a symptom of fascism, which destiny did in their previous conversation, but she was
2553840	2555160	too cucked to speak up about.
2555160	2559120	Like Dave Rubin, I think it's an easy example that shouldn't have a platform.
2559160	2561640	Well, no, I'm not sure I would have to think about Ruben.
2561640	2563520	So again, I want to be really, really, really careful here.
2563520	2564520	Okay.
2564520	2567800	So remember primarily my value system is usually going after what is true.
2567800	2569240	I don't care about political agendas.
2569240	2572080	I have no desire to push a political agenda whatsoever.
2572080	2573080	I don't care.
2573080	2574520	I have no interest, no desire.
2574520	2577800	So I think that all offensive ideas should be spoken about.
2577800	2582960	So pedophilia, incest, Ku Klux Klan, Nazism, ethno states, all of that shit, communism,
2582960	2583960	whatever the fuck.
2583960	2585640	All of these ideas should be up for discussion.
2585640	2586640	I'm okay with that.
2586640	2589840	And I'm okay with people providing a platform to discuss these ideas.
2589840	2591200	The ideas don't bother me.
2591200	2597160	It's just engaging in disinformation or misinformation or reckless, like reckless reporting that
2597160	2599360	is like horrendously disingenuous.
2601360	2606880	Yeah, I don't have, I don't want to name drop too many people, but the reason I specifically
2606880	2612760	think of Ruben instantly is because he really, really interviews a lot of people who are
2612760	2618640	far to the alt-right and even further so, and I feel like platforming those people and
2618640	2625640	giving them just basically a softball interview to pitch their platform, I feel like really
2625640	2627840	does a disservice to everybody that's watching.
2627840	2629120	I don't, I don't agree with that.
2629120	2631320	I mean, it gets the ideas out there.
2631320	2633720	Even if you might find them offensive or horrible, it just gets the ideas out.
2633720	2636440	I mean, do you make all softball interviews illegal then or?
2636440	2641360	Well, no, not at all, but I mean, isn't that, isn't that your point though?
2641360	2645040	Cause isn't that sort of fake news on, on steroids.
2645040	2646040	No, I don't think so.
2646040	2647040	The pinnacle of that.
2647040	2648040	Well, like, so here's a question.
2648040	2651320	If you want to go after people that give softball interviews to extremists, what about somebody
2651320	2655400	that has a channel where they interview like Contra points or the interview Sean and January
2655400	2661120	somebody, and they give them all softball questions, would that be no, I feel like that's
2661120	2662120	entirely different.
2662120	2669160	If your channel, give me some, wow, very clearly a stilted, uh, slant, you know, you're just
2669160	2670160	an interview channel.
2670160	2674840	But Dave Rubin, I don't feel like is presented as such as it's presented as the marketplace
2674840	2677280	of ideas, which it very clearly isn't.
2677280	2678280	Yeah.
2678280	2679280	Maybe.
2679280	2680280	I don't know.
2680280	2681280	I guess it's, it's, I like to focus on branding and presentation.
2681280	2684520	I like to focus on fake news because I can do a hard line objective.
2684520	2685840	Like this is bullshit.
2685840	2688040	You're screenshotting article headlines.
2688040	2689720	You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
2689720	2691880	Like you're, you're lying to your teeth.
2691880	2696400	That's easy to target saying somebody like Dave Rubin, disingenuously, disingenuously
2696400	2697400	presents as policy.
2697400	2700680	I feel like that line is a lot harder to walk.
2700680	2703200	Yeah, maybe so.
2703200	2704200	Maybe.
2704200	2709800	So this is all a year and a half before destiny and Vash stopped publicly being friends after
2709800	2714200	that infamous Kyle Rittenhouse debate destiny always described Vash as his friend, white
2714200	2718960	nervosa spent time in his community as a noted orbiter, but it seems to be increasingly obvious,
2718960	2723680	at least to me that these people were simply using him the whole time for, and to tie it
2723680	2728480	all into one neat package, Vash and white nervosa advocate for direct violence against
2728480	2732400	fascists, keeping in mind that to them, fascists are not only fascists, but liberals, centrists
2732400	2733400	and rightists.
2733400	2735680	And she even readmits as much in the statement.
2735680	2742880	And I feel like we can win on like, like socialism because emotional appeals or emotional propaganda
2742880	2743880	is very, very easy.
2743880	2747360	How do you win on like against fascism?
2747360	2751760	Like, because that's a really tough, like, you know, they, they show like the other and
2751760	2756280	they're going to take, you know, your kid's job, like, I mean, I don't, I don't think
2756280	2757480	you can argue with fascists.
2757480	2759080	I think they just need to be killed or something.
2759080	2764160	I don't disagree with you, but I mean, like from a, like for attacking, uh, like centrists,
2764160	2770320	like how do you attack, especially since it's so crypto in the first place, like, like it's
2770320	2773720	not usually Charlottesville and like it's a wordness.
2773720	2779080	I mean, ideally I think a lot of centrists are crypto fascist too, and they get the bullet
2779080	2780080	as well.
2780080	2783640	But the system we live in today is full of violence as it exists.
2783640	2784640	And to ignore that.
2784640	2785640	Yeah.
2785640	2786640	Oh God.
2786640	2787640	That fucking triggers me.
2787640	2788640	This is literally nothing.
2788640	2794280	Well, like, I mean, people don't realize that a government is just a society agreeing on
2794280	2795280	violence.
2795280	2801520	Like, you know, like, like if guns are being passed around, like fucking, I mean, I, like,
2801520	2804320	I don't know, fucking well, like let's go.
2804320	2808280	What matters is if you see me in the street with my Mosin, okay, what matters is that
2809280	2810280	I join you with two.
2810280	2811280	Okay.
2811280	2812280	All right.
2812280	2813280	Yeah.
2813280	2814280	My fucking comrades.
2814280	2818400	Hey, destiny being a liberal is only there to either be subverted or destroyed.
2818400	2822160	And because they both failed to subvert him and they're both too bitch baby to actually
2822160	2826080	do anything outside their own houses, destroying him online is the next best thing.
2826080	2830500	With all of this additional context, look at white nervosa statement on the Rose wrist
2830500	2835400	thing again, allow this to be a larger statement on those who look towards DGG for a place
2835400	2838000	to be rather than a place to move on from.
2838720	2839720	They don't watch your content.
2839720	2840720	Never.
2840720	2841720	You're nothing but a tool to them.
2841720	2842720	This isn't picking sides.
2842720	2844640	This is understanding that DGG isn't a place for growth.
2844640	2845840	On the one hand, you're entirely wrong.
2845840	2849680	There's a ton of content creators who have benefited greatly from the destiny bump, erudite,
2849680	2852880	stardust, counterpoints, even vosh, but the difference is that they took the exposure
2852880	2857200	destiny gave them and then made something that was new, something that was them using
2857200	2858640	the opportunity properly.
2858640	2863400	White nervosa didn't like DK said, everything she's done is simply a copy of the work of
2863400	2864400	better people.
2864400	2868200	On the other hand, though, this mindset of white nervosas pretty much proves my point
2868200	2871040	that her and her crowd are just users.
2871040	2875040	To them, DGG is a stepping stone to appeal to when it builds them up and to attack when
2875040	2876040	it builds them up.
2876040	2877620	Vash and Asan did this to destiny.
2877620	2880700	A bunch of crumb tubers did it too, book smarts, Merrick, Xanderhal.
2880700	2882960	This is also what's happening to chud logic right now.
2882960	2886880	And now that twitch politics has become an insular lefty only space, they're turning
2886880	2889080	on each other for clout as they always do.
2889080	2893020	Right now, as I'm recording this bad bunny and keffles are getting into a fight because
2893020	2896280	they're both fucking irrelevant, contributing nothing of substance to anything.
2896280	2900220	And despite their public exclamations of commitment to the leftist cause, they're only here
2900220	2901220	to make money.
2901220	2905980	And yes, underneath all of the rhetoric, that's all it is for any of these leftoids.
2905980	2909780	You don't need to actually build socialism if you're a rich socialist because you've
2909780	2911180	got the correct beliefs.
2911180	2915260	So whatever is a good consequentialist end for you is what the good is.
2915260	2919060	In fact, with white nervosa, it's even more blatant because the main reason she even tried
2919060	2923000	to be a streamer before the whole white forest thing is so that she could stream snipe other
2923000	2926440	people's auto-hosts and turn those donations into cocaine.
2926440	2929940	And no, this isn't just some Kiwi Farms rumor, though they get a kick out of it too.
2929940	2932160	This is something that is actually confirmed by her.
2932160	2938960	Yeah, I mean, I just love the EU streams, I'm trying to jack the auto-hosts from everybody
2938960	2941560	else so, you know, we start early as fuck.
2941560	2944900	Listen, just know that if you support the White Leaf Project, all that money is going
2944900	2946500	straight up her nose.
2946500	2948480	At this point, let's check out the big picture.
2948480	2952640	White Nervosa is a core part of Vasha's community, paid by him to rip off Destiny's
2952680	2955400	code for his, and later, all of BreadTube's use.
2955400	2959520	This entire group shares the same ethics, which constitute a violent support of revolutionary
2959520	2963640	leftism without any concern of the actual behaviors involved, or concern for any of
2963640	2965760	the outcomes beyond what is simply good for them.
2965760	2968920	And beneath that mask, what is good is whatever makes them money.
2968920	2972640	And people who disagree with what they consider the good to be exist only to be exploited
2972640	2976280	by them, to either be converted to their cause or discarded and destroyed.
2976280	2980540	And in order to accomplish all of this, these people are willing to lie, to cheat, to steal,
2980540	2983580	to attack you in the street if they had the opportunity, to deprive you of your income
2983580	2987420	so that you and your dependents starve, to go against every stated value that they claim
2987420	2990820	to hold, including things like universal human rights or democracy.
2990820	2995160	There is a direct throughline between the rhetoric these people used in 2018 and 2019
2995160	2997440	and their morally reprehensible behaviors today.
2997440	2999460	They were always going to become this.
2999460	3003540	This is why people in my area of the internet spoke out about it all those years ago.
3003540	3005780	We all told Shu on head she was going to get backstabbed.
3005780	3006780	She didn't believe us.
3006780	3007780	And here we are.
3007780	3012140	She was scamming chudlogic in like April 2022 or something, saying, I bet demon mama backstabs
3012140	3013140	you within the next six months.
3013140	3014540	And he was like, I don't know, man.
3014540	3015820	And lo and behold, she did.
3015820	3019700	When I spoke to Dylan Burns, I told him there will probably eventually be backlash for you
3019700	3021740	and I talking, especially if you do it regularly.
3021740	3022740	And it hasn't come yet.
3022740	3024000	But, you know, it will.
3024000	3026660	I don't agree with Sargon or ArchWarhammer all the time.
3026660	3030740	We have some very rowdy debates in private, but we never violate the meta-ethic that is
3030740	3031740	the friendship.
3031740	3033660	Over some political disagreement, why would we?
3033660	3036540	Even though they're drifting away from me politically, and I agree with them less and
3036540	3041100	less over time, they are vastly better people than any of these BreadTube fucks.
3041100	3043920	White Nervosa herself is just a blip on the radar.
3043920	3047540	She will fade in the same way that Kefles is fading, now that her Drop Kiwi Farms campaign
3047540	3049380	has failed spectacularly.
3049380	3053260	Even if you were braindead enough to be interested in the BreadTube socialist type of thing,
3053260	3057700	all of her content is just what the larger BreadTubers say, only strictly worse.
3057700	3060140	Her only claim to fame is exactly as DK said.
3060140	3061780	She stole the work of better people.
3061780	3064300	She enriched herself, temporarily, off that work.
3064300	3066880	She has no ability to innovate on that foundation.
3066880	3069740	And so, when the ecosystem moves on, she will be left behind.
3069740	3074660	Her one claim to fame is fleeting fast, and nothing else she's ever done has any substance
3074660	3075660	whatsoever.
3075660	3079140	She will one day wake up and discover that the cocaine money has dried up, nobody's
3079140	3083180	keeping up with her anymore, nobody's using the few dollops of value she stole from others
3083180	3084180	anymore.
3084180	3086660	Theirs is a community of users, in many ways.
3086660	3090180	And White Nervosa is rapidly reaching the end of her usefulness.
3090180	3094060	I don't know why she thinks she won't be discarded, in the same way that she and
3094060	3096260	her ilk have discarded so many others.
