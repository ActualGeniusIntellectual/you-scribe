00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
Have you ever noticed how people who are particularly ignorant of the internet call 4chan or Newgrounds

00:10.800 --> 00:12.360
a social media platform?

00:12.360 --> 00:15.720
I've heard this from boomers who still think that TV is a new technology.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.160
They have no idea what the internet is, and they're just using the terms they hear their

00:19.160 --> 00:20.160
grandkids saying.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.280
But I've also heard it from zoomers who only consume online content through whatever

00:24.280 --> 00:26.320
apps come preloaded on their smartphone.

00:26.320 --> 00:29.160
To them, the entire internet is literally just whatever is in front of the curtain.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.120
I guess as a millennial, I got lucky.

00:31.120 --> 00:34.740
My youngest years were in an era before the internet, and I still got a taste of that

00:34.740 --> 00:38.480
it's summer, go outside with your friends and be home by dinnertime experience.

00:38.480 --> 00:43.060
But when I finally did make my way online, it was amazingly decentralized.

00:43.060 --> 00:46.640
Each community had its own website, its own form, its own type of service, when nowadays

00:46.640 --> 00:48.740
they're all on Twitter or YouTube or whatever.

00:48.740 --> 00:53.040
You can definitely see different species of sites emerge as time went on.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.320
We call Twitter a social media platform, but what it really is, is a microblogging service.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.560
A place where you can post short length random thoughts in a timeline structure.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.240
Facebook operates this way too, same with Gab, Parler, Getter, and Truth Social.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.520
They're all microbloggers.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.760
To contrast, YouTube and TikTok, though they're also considered social media, they're not

01:10.760 --> 01:11.760
microbloggers.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.900
4chan's an image board, like 2chan and 7chan and 420chan and all the other chans that have

01:15.900 --> 01:17.300
popped in and out of existence.

01:17.300 --> 01:21.360
And hey, just as a side note, do you remember that one 4chan April Fools prank where Moot

01:21.360 --> 01:25.520
added a cross post to Facebook option and a bunch of retards thinking it was a troll,

01:25.520 --> 01:29.280
ended up putting porn and shit all over their normie Facebooks for their parents to see?

01:29.280 --> 01:30.820
Ah, that was good times.

01:30.820 --> 01:36.060
Point is, the phrase social media seems to have morphed into a Gen Z term for what we

01:36.060 --> 01:40.040
used to call a website when there's actually multiple different types of sites.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.560
From forms to blogs to video platforms.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.520
The streamer Destiny's website, destiny.gg or DGG, was kind of hard to quantify using

01:48.520 --> 01:50.240
this paradigm, at least for me.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.840
Here was my thought process on it.

01:51.840 --> 01:55.720
It's certainly a repository of his stream and YouTube content, but it also serves partially

01:55.720 --> 01:58.280
as his blog, his merch store, and even his forums.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.820
And it's got a particular, slick feeling that makes it stand out beyond other portals,

02:02.820 --> 02:04.360
like Channel Awesome or Newgrounds.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.240
Also, as somebody who's not really a part of the Twitch politics side of the internet,

02:08.240 --> 02:13.360
when I first noticed that Vosh's website, VGG, was basically a carbon copy of Destiny's,

02:13.360 --> 02:17.160
I figured that this was some sort of shared plugin system or drop and run setup that was

02:17.160 --> 02:18.160
common among this community.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.720
I don't know, is it called a GG site, is that what we're talking about here?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.800
That's when I discovered what I thought was the source of these sites.

02:24.800 --> 02:29.520
A service called White Leaf or White Forest, run by a person named White Nervosa.

02:29.520 --> 02:33.680
Turns out, White Leaf is the type of website, White Forest is the company providing it,

02:33.680 --> 02:35.400
and White Nervosa is the person.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.560
White Forest is legally a worker co-op, with nine members, one member, one vote.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.460
They operate White Leaf sites, as well as doing merch fulfillment, thanks to the financial

02:43.460 --> 02:44.640
support of Vosh.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.680
Their stated goal is to provide an accessible and independent platform for content creators.

02:48.680 --> 02:53.080
And they do have an extensive list of reasonably high-profile leftist people they host.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.520
The ones that I recognize personally are Vosh, Shuonhead, Kefls, Chrisraygun, The Surfs,

02:57.520 --> 03:02.160
Dylan Burns, Konur, who is some femboy in Vosh's Polycule, Merrick, Xanderhal, The

03:02.160 --> 03:06.800
Deer Girl, Demon Mama, and Counterpoints, who's actually a Burkean conservative, not

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
a leftist.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.520
Which initially made me think this service might have been apolitical, just used primarily

03:11.520 --> 03:12.520
by leftists.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.680
But of course, that's actually not the case.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.960
Although the White Forest company is kept afloat by patrons, it's also directly funded

03:18.960 --> 03:19.960
by Vosh.

03:19.960 --> 03:24.540
The fine print reads, no White Leaf users are necessarily affiliated with or endorsed

03:24.540 --> 03:27.500
by White Nervosa or other members of White Forest.

03:27.500 --> 03:32.320
The only content creators that pay White Forest are Vosh or those who choose to be a patron.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.600
And then I noticed another interesting tidbit down there.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.240
Website framework is a derivative work from DGG, Creative Commons Attribution, Share Like

03:40.240 --> 03:41.240
3.0.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.240
That's right!

03:42.240 --> 03:44.640
DGG is not on the list of White Leaf sites.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.680
DGG isn't a White Leaf site, all the White Leaf sites are ripoffs of DGG.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.260
There's a fella in Destiny's community named Cake.

03:51.260 --> 03:52.600
He does a lot of the tech work over there.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.980
I've had a couple of casual conversations with him, nice guy, seems competent.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.560
He put out a history of DGG to set the record straight.

03:58.560 --> 04:02.760
The code behind DGG was open source and available for anyone to use, because Destiny wanted

04:02.760 --> 04:06.440
other content creators to have something they could use for themselves to help bootstrap

04:06.440 --> 04:07.440
their own careers.

04:07.600 --> 04:13.400
In early 2019, White Nervosa took the DGG code and made a variant of it for Vosh, VGG,

04:13.400 --> 04:15.540
which eventually became the White Leaf template.

04:15.540 --> 04:19.840
There was actually early drama between Cake and White Nervosa, as Cake provided his assistants

04:19.840 --> 04:24.140
believing his work was going towards White Nervosa's own site, not Vosh's site, or

04:24.140 --> 04:26.600
to create a service for many other creators.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.960
As somebody relatively new to this section of the internet, this stunned me.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.680
How the hell was it that all of these people who hate Destiny have the gall to blatantly

04:33.680 --> 04:37.680
rip off his site code, even going so far as to say Destiny's got nothing to do with

04:37.680 --> 04:38.680
it?

04:38.680 --> 04:42.700
Alright, here's where I would have subbed in that viral clip of Kefl's from last summer,

04:42.700 --> 04:46.560
streaming during the opening of her own White Leaf site, KGG, where she made the claim that

04:46.560 --> 04:49.880
her site was actually not ripped off from Destiny's and he had nothing to do with

04:49.880 --> 04:50.880
it.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.700
I remember seeing that clip all over the place back then.

04:52.700 --> 04:57.280
It must have been retweeted back onto my timeline at least a few dozen times, but by January

04:57.280 --> 04:59.680
2023, it seems to have vanished from the internet.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.720
Ah well, I'm sure you all remember it.

05:01.720 --> 05:05.340
It feels kind of like people trying to say that JK Rowling isn't the real creator of

05:05.340 --> 05:08.800
Harry Potter now that her TERF views have come to light, or the Five Nights at Freddy's

05:08.800 --> 05:12.080
guy doesn't count as the creator after it came out he was pro-life.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.320
It's not hard to see how we got to this point.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.440
I've done a lot of videos on this topic before.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.760
Mindless consequentialism, truth is downstream from power, just make reality whatever serves

05:18.760 --> 05:20.900
the politics, you know the story at this point.

05:20.900 --> 05:25.200
Because of the volatility between Destiny and, like, all of the people using White Leaf

05:25.200 --> 05:27.360
sites, this was obviously going to blow up eventually.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.480
And it did, with the deplatforming of Rose Wriste.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.280
Rose Wriste is some young Shoda kid who used to be a streamer.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.360
I think he gave it up to go to school or something.

05:35.360 --> 05:40.080
He's very progressive, very much a Nordic model kind of guy, but he is not a revolutionary

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
socialist.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.420
During the Trump era, he and many others like him sided with the socialists online.

05:44.420 --> 05:49.200
But post-Trump, Rose Wriste is another casualty on a long list of casualties from the internet's

05:49.200 --> 05:52.060
socialist-slash-social-liberal split.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.380
Rose Wriste helped Destiny with his huge manifesto on Kefls.

05:55.380 --> 05:59.240
As far as I know, not in terms of digging up information, but in terms of grammar and

05:59.240 --> 06:02.140
spell-checking, and also working over his logical inferences.

06:02.140 --> 06:05.220
In other words, not on content, but on presentation and polish.

06:05.220 --> 06:09.600
In response, Rose Wriste's White Leaf site, roserist.com, I think it was, was made to

06:09.600 --> 06:12.920
redirect to the Drop Kiwi Farms site that Kefls put up.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.840
Here's the DMs between Rose Wriste and White Nervosa.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.160
Did you change my website?

06:17.160 --> 06:20.840
White Forest has voted, worker co-op, remember, to discontinue servers to your site.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.120
I wish you the best of luck.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.360
Okay, I understand.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.940
Can you then fully detach all your stuff from my purchased domain so that it's just a dead

06:26.940 --> 06:27.940
link?

06:27.940 --> 06:28.940
You own the domain.

06:28.940 --> 06:31.940
I know that I'm not particularly adept when it comes to website stuff.

06:31.940 --> 06:35.140
I could probably figure out how to disconnect it myself, but I just wanted to ask.

06:35.140 --> 06:39.820
Cake charges $3,000 and then $150 a month for the services you were given.

06:39.820 --> 06:41.420
You cannot ask me for help, no.

06:41.420 --> 06:45.240
Okay, so to be clear, you won't even detach the stuff you've attached to my domain after

06:45.240 --> 06:46.580
you decided to drop it?

06:46.580 --> 06:48.280
To be clear, it is your domain.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.700
If you don't understand that I can't detach it from my servers, that's not my problem.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.020
Sure, but you're doing something to redirect it to Drop Kiwi Farms, right?

06:55.020 --> 06:56.020
Good luck.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.700
Thanks for all your help over the past two years.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.700
I appreciate it.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.740
Your words ring hollow, but I hope you grow to understand my position.

07:02.740 --> 07:04.800
Here's the tech explanation of what's going on.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.900
When you put in a website into your browser, Google.com for example, your computer communicates

07:08.900 --> 07:10.500
with a domain name registrar.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.780
Google owns the domain name Google.com, and the registrar links that domain with an IP

07:14.780 --> 07:19.600
address, in this case 142.251.42.100.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.300
If you were to type that set of numbers into your browser, you'd go to the Google homepage.

07:23.300 --> 07:28.200
And believe it or not, in the very early internet, there was no domain names, only IP addresses.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.800
You had to memorize which addresses led to which sites, like telephone numbers without

07:31.800 --> 07:32.800
profiles attached.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.760
So, the IP address is the number of a physical computer somewhere on the internet that hosts

07:36.760 --> 07:37.760
the website.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.600
And the domain name is a shorthand for that address, registered with the registrar.

07:40.600 --> 07:45.340
Rose Wriste owns the domain name RoseWriste.com, and he asked his registrar to have it point

07:45.340 --> 07:48.640
to the IP address of his White Leaf site hosted by White Forest.

07:48.640 --> 07:53.400
But what White Nervosa did was have the IP address on White Forest's end redirect to

07:53.400 --> 07:55.240
the Kefl's Drop Kiwi Farms page.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.400
All Rose Wriste had to do to remedy the situation was to log in to his registrar and have it

07:59.400 --> 08:00.740
point at a different IP.

08:00.740 --> 08:03.960
But Rose Wriste, not being very tech-savvy, didn't know any of this.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.280
Something that White Nervosa knew he was ignorant of.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.320
That's why the only reply given when Rose Wriste asked, you're doing something to

08:10.320 --> 08:13.200
redirect it to Drop Kiwi Farms, right, was, good luck.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.160
No admission of guilt or innocence, no confirm or denial, just have fun figuring it out,

08:17.160 --> 08:18.160
fuck you.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.520
I should point out that Rose Wriste, like every other creator with White Forest, with

08:21.520 --> 08:24.360
the exception of Vosh, didn't pay for a White Leaf site.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.960
And White Nervosa retains the right to stop working with anyone at any time.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.300
Nothing illegal has been done here, but it's certainly pretty scummy behavior, taking advantage

08:31.300 --> 08:33.940
of Rose Wriste's ignorance on tech topics.

08:33.940 --> 08:38.480
And eventually, Rose Wriste released a detailed manifesto describing his experience working

08:38.480 --> 08:42.600
with White Forest, where it became clear that this wasn't the only scummy thing White

08:42.600 --> 08:43.960
Nervosa had done.

08:43.960 --> 08:48.320
Here is a list of 9 complaints Rose Wriste had regarding his time affiliated with White

08:48.320 --> 08:49.320
Forest.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.320
1.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.800
He was not given an opportunity to make his case when White Forest voted to discontinue

08:54.240 --> 08:55.240
2.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.240
He was not even given notice that such a vote was happening

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
3.

08:58.240 --> 09:02.240
He was not even given notice that services to his website had stopped and only found

09:02.240 --> 09:04.080
out several days later 4.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.880
He did not consent to White Forest and White Nervosa changing the server connected to his

09:07.880 --> 09:11.560
domain to make it redirect to a website that they knew he was opposed to

09:11.560 --> 09:12.560
5.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.640
He was not given notice that this redirection was happening

09:14.640 --> 09:15.640
6.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.680
He was treated rudely by White Nervosa when he inquired into the changes

09:18.680 --> 09:19.680
7.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.360
He was publicly ridiculed for this interaction by White Nervosa

09:22.360 --> 09:23.360
8.

09:23.920 --> 09:27.440
He did not receive any follow-up regarding the handling of sensitive connections or information

09:27.440 --> 09:30.560
of his or of the users who used his website 9.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.720
He did not receive any assistance with resetting the DNS setting from White Nervosa who knew

09:34.720 --> 09:36.440
he was incapable of doing so.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.660
As a client of White Forest, you can, without notice or chance to defend yourself, have

09:40.660 --> 09:44.140
your services discontinued, because the 9 members of the co-op have decided to vote

09:44.140 --> 09:46.180
you out, and you won't even be told about it.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.540
You can have your domain redirected to a website you are publicly opposed to.

09:49.540 --> 09:53.180
You can be humiliated, publicly and privately, by White Nervosa herself.

09:53.180 --> 09:57.100
You can be ignored when you ask about the handling of sensitive information stored on

09:57.100 --> 09:58.100
the site.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.540
And you can be left high and dry in trying to undo the damage they've caused.

10:01.540 --> 10:05.700
White Forest's stated goal of providing an accessible and independent platform for

10:05.700 --> 10:09.980
content creators seems to be a false one, at least if you happen to assist the guy who

10:09.980 --> 10:12.720
originated the code they aped in the first place.

10:12.720 --> 10:16.360
After this whole thing blew up and White Nervosa was dragged on Twitter for it, Rose Wriste

10:16.360 --> 10:19.740
received an apology DM saying, I truly don't wish you deplatformed.

10:19.740 --> 10:20.740
Yeah, alright.

10:20.900 --> 10:25.420
Also, White Nervosa admitted to being drunk during the whole thing, which is, um, okay.

10:25.420 --> 10:28.300
However, the apology only applied to the public ridiculing.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.500
White Nervosa doubled down on everything else.

10:30.500 --> 10:34.700
In one Twitter exchange, White Nervosa says, Rose Wriste agreed to our standard operating

10:34.700 --> 10:35.700
procedure.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.280
Is asked, is your standard operating procedure to redirect someone's domain name to a completely

10:39.280 --> 10:41.860
different website they don't want to be affiliated with?

10:41.860 --> 10:46.040
A White Nervosa supporter chimes in with, this is industry standard operating procedure.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.540
When you suspend a service, it is not uncommon to redirect it to the provider's homepage

10:49.540 --> 10:54.440
or a contextually relevant site, and is replied to with, the drop Kiwi Farms site is absolutely

10:54.440 --> 10:55.980
not contextually relevant.

10:55.980 --> 11:00.420
White Nervosa says, he called Kefles a terrorist for attempting to get Kiwi Farms taken down.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.100
It is absolutely relevant.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.600
What actually happened here is that at one point during the Kiwi Farms drama, Kefles

11:05.600 --> 11:10.140
was pointing out that Kiwi Farms was hosted in Ukrainian server farm and then posted its

11:10.140 --> 11:15.140
location, implying that Ukrainian partisans may want to attack it because Kiwi Farms hosts

11:15.140 --> 11:16.420
Russian propaganda.

11:16.420 --> 11:21.140
Destiny described this in his manifesto as calling for terroristic violence, the manifesto

11:21.140 --> 11:25.020
that Rose Wriste edited for grammar and logic, and specifically not content.

11:25.020 --> 11:28.500
To White Nervosa, this was Rose Wriste calling Kefles a terrorist.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.740
The reply guy asks, so you're purposely redirecting his domain name to a website for a cause he

11:32.740 --> 11:35.580
specifically doesn't agree with, and that's somehow morally okay to you?

11:35.580 --> 11:37.700
And White Nervosa simply replies, yes.

11:37.700 --> 11:42.220
White Nervosa also made a big dance around that standing operating procedure of theirs,

11:42.220 --> 11:45.980
stating White Forest discontinues sites that have been inactive for more than 90 days.

11:45.980 --> 11:49.380
When this happens, there is a default screen for if there's nothing to catch the URL.

11:49.380 --> 11:53.020
Rose Wriste had passed the mark, handling over two dozen websites that wasn't a top

11:53.020 --> 11:54.020
priority.

11:54.020 --> 11:58.360
After he contributed to and endorsed a document calling for Cloudflare to protect Kiwi Farms,

11:58.360 --> 11:59.420
it became a priority.

11:59.420 --> 12:00.420
This was Sunday.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.500
He didn't notice until Wednesday, which is when I acted poorly towards him.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.180
I regret that and apologize.

12:05.180 --> 12:09.020
Anybody who claims it's because he dared attack Kefles ignores that he streamed in

12:09.020 --> 12:10.540
July critiquing Kefles.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.540
This was not an issue.

12:11.540 --> 12:15.120
You literally just mentioned one tweet ago that it was about the Kefles document.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.880
Of course, people began to notice all the holes in this argument.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.800
The dear gender person hadn't streamed in six months, but is still on White Forest.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.080
White Nervosa replied, oh, it's because she's still getting automated donations.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.240
This idea that Rose Wriste wasn't getting any automated donations is weird to me.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.040
Rose was small but still doing well, well enough to have some automated subs or something.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.800
But White Nervosa, who is the only one with access to the logs, stated, nope, Rose had

12:37.800 --> 12:42.000
no donos, don't question it, even though Rose Wriste provided proof of many donations

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
during that time.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.920
Moreover, Rose Wriste did in fact stream during the 90-day period, nine times, and you can

12:47.920 --> 12:51.400
see the distinctive White Leaf chat overlay in those streams.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.920
White Nervosa then claimed that Rose Wriste asked for a site to be deleted, which Rose

12:54.920 --> 12:59.280
Wriste's own DMs disprove, and then finally claims that it actually is about Kefles, saying

12:59.280 --> 13:02.600
it would not be brought back up assuming he maintained his endorsement.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.760
Dude, at this point, just bite the bullet.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.380
Say it was a power move and that you did it because you're in charge and you didn't

13:07.380 --> 13:09.240
like what Rose Wriste did off platform.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.520
We know that's why you did it.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.720
You know that's why you did it.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.560
All this dancing around just makes you look like even more of a fucking snake.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.840
For a while, I believe that White Nervosa as a person was just a side story to the larger

13:18.840 --> 13:19.840
Kefles drama.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.800
A little extra bit of an intermission in between the real happenings.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.280
But now, I think White Nervosa is actually a lolcow in her own right.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.600
And the reason I've come to that conclusion is the Chud logic drama.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.400
All the stuff with Rose Wriste was months ago.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.040
It was involving White Nervosa's capacity at the head of a business, and it involved

13:35.040 --> 13:36.040
Kefles.

13:36.040 --> 13:40.400
But now, White Nervosa herself is just going nuts over literally nothing.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
Let's check it out.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.440
On January 17th, White Nervosa tweeted this.

13:43.440 --> 13:47.040
I'm out of my mind, Chud logic, but is there any reason you're paying a person who felt

13:47.040 --> 13:48.620
the need to tweet this twice?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.640
Are you too lazy to find another editor?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.840
Are they doing it for scraps off the plate so it's worth it?

13:52.840 --> 13:54.320
Is there no connection you feel?

13:54.320 --> 13:58.520
This is in response to DriftKingEdits, also known as DK, Chud's editor, tweeting the

13:58.520 --> 14:00.140
following in quick succession.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.480
Not really sure what's going on, but Andrew Callahan definitely didn't rape that young

14:03.480 --> 14:04.480
lady.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.880
Followed by, not really sure what's going on, but Andrew Callahan definitely raped that

14:07.880 --> 14:08.880
young lady.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.800
Now, I'm not really sure what's going on with Andrew Callahan, but I'm pretty sure

14:11.800 --> 14:12.800
this is a joke.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.020
It's literally the cover all your bases thing.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.420
And White Nervosa was offended by it, to the point that she went to Chud logic and did

14:18.420 --> 14:20.960
the cancel culture, why is he your editor thing.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.960
Chud's response was to point out that while White Nervosa is tagging him into the tweet,

14:24.960 --> 14:28.440
making it look like to her followers that she's inviting him to have a conversation,

14:28.440 --> 14:30.000
she's actually got him blocked.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.480
He can't see it, so it looks like he's ducking her.

14:32.480 --> 14:37.120
But he replied anyway, simply saying, I will never kowtow to the gay retarded sensibilities

14:37.120 --> 14:40.920
of leftoids based, always reject the struggle session.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.720
The Twitter canceling attempt went nowhere.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.640
So White Nervosa took it a step further by reporting Chud's Twitch channel to Twitch

14:46.640 --> 14:49.000
because he called her a gay retard on Twitter.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.480
And even though Twitch's off platform policies can be kind of ridiculous, even they weren't

14:53.480 --> 14:55.380
ridiculous enough to take this bait.

14:55.380 --> 14:59.520
Twitch has explicitly told me that it's okay that the partner Chud logic has called me

14:59.520 --> 15:01.740
another partner, a gay retard.

15:01.740 --> 15:05.440
Take that as you will and do as you wish off platform, as long as it's not an imminent

15:05.440 --> 15:06.440
threat.

15:06.440 --> 15:10.160
Yeah, Twitch's off service conduct policy states that Twitch will ban you if you do

15:10.160 --> 15:12.000
any of the following off platform.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
1.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.880
Engage in deadly violence or terrorism or terroristic recruiting.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.880
2.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.880
Explicit and or credible threats of mass violence.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.880
3.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.760
Explicit and or credible threats against Twitch.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.760
4.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.040
Leadership, membership, sponsorship of a known hate group.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
5.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.360
Carrying out or acting as an accomplice to sexual assault.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.360
6.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.360
Sexual exploitation of youth.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.360
7.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.080
Compromising the physical safety of the Twitch community.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.080
8.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.080
Harmful misinformation.

15:35.080 --> 15:39.080
And any of this stuff applied to Chud logic calling White Nervosa a gay retard.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.480
It's not terrorism or violence, it's not a credible threat, it's not membership

15:42.480 --> 15:45.840
in a hate group unless you count the Chud nation, it's not sexual assault or exploiting

15:45.840 --> 15:50.040
youth or threatening the safety of Twitch, and perhaps most explicitly of all, it's

15:50.040 --> 15:51.560
not misinformation either.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.040
White Nervosa continued to complain about Twitch refusing to take action on offsite

15:55.040 --> 15:56.460
behavior beyond what's listed.

15:56.460 --> 16:00.560
And the reason why is explicitly because she wants Chud logic deplatformed.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.240
Hey, and like with Rose Wriste, at least she has the balls to say it directly this time.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.680
Or maybe it's because Chud's an easier target among leftoids than Rose Wriste was.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.680
Who knows.

16:08.680 --> 16:12.100
Chud's reply was to call White Nervosa a disgusting freak who has no problems with

16:12.100 --> 16:15.800
abusing power and is now making a concerted effort to deplatform him.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.840
White Nervosa mocks the concerted effort bit by saying she sent one email and she actually

16:19.840 --> 16:20.840
doesn't really care.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.120
Despite, of course, being the one who started the Nothing Burger and pushing her followers

16:24.120 --> 16:25.120
to go at it.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.880
Chud's editor, DK, returned to write a lengthy anime villain post about how basically, White

16:29.880 --> 16:33.840
Nervosa is a fraud hack who will fade away because everything she's ever done that's

16:33.840 --> 16:37.520
noteworthy has been stolen by others and the next wave of innovation will be the end

16:37.520 --> 16:38.680
of her 15 minutes of fame.

16:38.680 --> 16:42.240
The backlash White Nervosa received from all of this nonsense was enough to make her leave

16:42.240 --> 16:43.380
Twitter for a few days.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.380
But only a few.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.040
These people always come back eventually.

16:46.040 --> 16:50.000
White Nervosa is also a moderator for Vaush's community, though she may be on a break from

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
that position for a while.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
She's friends with him.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
She still runs his site.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
She gets paid by him.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.240
And was a mod for a long time.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.920
While White Nervosa was offline, some other Vaush mod, Thena, publicly continued the crusade

16:59.920 --> 17:02.880
in her place, repeating the calls for Twitch to ban Chud.

17:02.920 --> 17:07.320
But more notably, she went into Vaush's community and began petitioning Vaush viewers to join

17:07.320 --> 17:12.720
in on the dogpile, saying that Chud is violating his Twitch partner contract by harassing her

17:12.720 --> 17:14.200
over her gender identity.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.200
Excuse me, but where the fuck did this happen?

17:16.200 --> 17:19.200
Come on, you really think you can just go on the internet and make shit up?

17:19.200 --> 17:24.320
Afterward, Thena banned Chud from VGG and the Vaush subreddit, as well as a bunch of

17:24.320 --> 17:28.400
other people who aren't even in these communities but have publicly spoken out against White

17:28.400 --> 17:32.640
Nervosa, most notably Stardust, who's been laughing at all this nonsense on her stream.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.240
Now, these people have the right to run their shitty little communities however they like.

17:36.240 --> 17:40.280
But this is just like 2015, 2016 all over again, where the leftoids won't tolerate

17:40.280 --> 17:44.120
anybody who disagrees with them even a little bit and will go scorched earth on everyone

17:44.120 --> 17:45.120
who steps out of line.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.760
And I'm not being hyperbolic.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.120
There was also the White Nervosa deny milkshakes drama.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.440
Deny milkshakes is some other flavor of leftist.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.120
These people always eat each other.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.840
And last fall, these two nobodies were at war.

17:56.840 --> 18:01.560
Deny milkshakes said Japanese nuclear bombings were genocidal terror apologia and he would

18:01.560 --> 18:04.360
block anyone who was partisan in favor of the bombings.

18:04.360 --> 18:08.520
Nervosa replied, calling him indistinguishable from a tanky and that he was making light

18:08.520 --> 18:09.880
of the Holocaust.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.360
Just so we're clear, there's a reason that socialists look at every other socialist

18:13.360 --> 18:15.760
except themselves and see fascists.

18:15.760 --> 18:20.640
White Nervosa, a totally sane person, replied to deny milkshakes by threatening to, if he

18:20.640 --> 18:25.640
did not agree to a streamed debate with her, block him, block his followers, and punish

18:25.640 --> 18:29.360
everyone using White Forest by deplatforming all of them.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.360
Well, hold on there.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.280
I thought this was a worker co-op, White Nervosa.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.960
I thought you needed a vote of the nine crumbtubers who run the whole thing in order to be able

18:35.960 --> 18:37.280
to do something like this.

18:37.280 --> 18:42.120
This is how the leftoid worker democracy always degenerates into an authoritarian shithole,

18:42.120 --> 18:43.120
by the way.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.600
It's always because another leftist disagrees with them and they can't accept disunity

18:46.600 --> 18:47.700
among the proles.

18:47.700 --> 18:52.320
The backlash to this event was severe, way more than anything related to tread logic,

18:52.320 --> 18:55.820
to the point that White Nervosa scrubbed the internet of it in an effort to get people

18:55.820 --> 18:57.280
to forget it ever happened.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.120
But the internet never forgets.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.360
And get a load at what the internet remembered.

19:01.360 --> 19:06.600
To be more specific, they said they were okay with Kefl's, Xanderhal, Roserist, Vosch,

19:06.600 --> 19:10.880
Marek, and several others being deplatformed because they refused to have a conversation

19:10.880 --> 19:12.960
about calling me a genocide apologist.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.960
Are you serious, bitch?

19:13.960 --> 19:15.960
You were the one with the finger on the off switch.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.680
This is nobody else's fault but your own.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.580
Why in the fuck would you ever get yourself a White Leaf site when the dictator running

19:21.580 --> 19:25.360
the whole operation can nuke you off the internet simply because she got into a Twitter

19:25.360 --> 19:27.720
spat with a random person you don't even know?

19:27.720 --> 19:31.440
Now this whole thing so far has just been lame twitter drama.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.700
And if it were only lame twitter drama, it wouldn't really be worth it for me to do

19:34.700 --> 19:35.700
a video on it.

19:35.700 --> 19:39.400
I enjoy watching Chud and Stardust dream about it, it's pretty fun to watch petty drama

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
sometimes.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.920
But my personal interest on its own isn't enough for me to make a video on the topic.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.640
What I discovered after digging into White Nervosa myself, though, was...

19:47.640 --> 19:49.520
Let's start at the surface level stuff.

19:49.520 --> 20:14.760
Check out Vosha's comments on this shitshow.

20:14.760 --> 20:27.300
Hold on, pause it right here.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.840
Look who posted that Xanderhal tweet in Vosha's chat.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.280
Oh, it's Xanderhal!

20:31.280 --> 20:34.480
The only guy who would ever actually post a Xanderhal tweet anywhere.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.960
He's literally doing the tattletale thing.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.520
And if you look around online, you'll find a lot of these crumbtubers all trying to pile

20:39.520 --> 20:41.720
on Chud and trying to get Vosha to come out against him.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.600
You gotta cancel Chud logic, guys.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.320
Vosha's reply, though, is kind of anemic.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.440
On the one hand, he doesn't seem to care too much about this stuff.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.640
But on the other, he's completely fine with his mods behaving this way.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.460
Now, I personally don't think that's a problem.

20:52.460 --> 20:56.320
What my mods do outside of the context of my community isn't any of my business, and

20:56.320 --> 20:58.320
I extend that chariability to everyone.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.520
But that's not the rules the progs use.

21:00.520 --> 21:05.800
These people are losing their marbles over what DK does and how Chud is obviously co-signing

21:05.800 --> 21:07.500
it all by continuing to employ him.

21:07.500 --> 21:12.980
So by that standard, Vosha is a worse person because of White Nervosa's terrible behavior.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.060
And the Chud deplatforming is just the tip of the iceberg.

21:15.060 --> 21:19.340
It's also how, while trying to get Chud deplatformed, they cry that any pushback they

21:19.340 --> 21:21.020
receive is harassment.

21:21.020 --> 21:24.820
This is literally the Jani cries out in pain as she strikes you.

21:24.820 --> 21:29.040
These people cry about body positivity and bigotry and trans-nonsense while at the same

21:29.040 --> 21:31.940
time using low testosterone as an insult.

21:31.940 --> 21:35.520
These people were the ones who face-doxed Chud logic in the first place.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.940
These people were the ones who thought it was a good idea to try and cover up Vosha's

21:38.940 --> 21:40.860
sexual harassment allegations.

21:40.860 --> 21:45.340
White Nervosa and her White Forest crowd are the gang of people who do the on-the-ground

21:45.340 --> 21:49.900
work of following around leftist streamers, most commonly Vosh, and cleaning up their

21:49.900 --> 21:54.420
messes, while serving as relentless attack dogs against anyone who dares to cross their

21:54.420 --> 21:55.660
parasocial daddies.

21:55.660 --> 21:56.660
Let's rewind.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.660
January 26th, 2018.

21:58.660 --> 22:03.860
Over a year before White Nervosa took the open-source DGG code and made a closed for-profit

22:03.860 --> 22:04.860
fork of it.

22:04.860 --> 22:07.860
She was a member of Destiny's community, no surprise there, and debated him on the

22:07.860 --> 22:08.860
topic of deplatforming.

22:08.860 --> 22:12.780
I can't believe we're here, five years later, having the same fucking conversations.

22:12.780 --> 22:16.360
This stream actually isn't too spicy, and there's not one clip that I can pull out

22:16.360 --> 22:18.060
to explicitly prove what I'm saying.

22:18.060 --> 22:20.640
It's the tone of the thing, you kinda have to watch it for yourself.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.980
White Nervosa is clearly trying to nudge Destiny to the left throughout the conversation, with

22:24.980 --> 22:29.040
the general tenor of the conversation being, well, these rightoids are idiots, so you should

22:29.040 --> 22:30.860
be agreeing more with us leftoids, right?

22:30.860 --> 22:32.940
And Destiny, to his credit, doesn't take the bait.

22:32.940 --> 22:38.260
I need a criterion by which I can deplatform somebody that I can objectively argue for,

22:38.260 --> 22:39.420
which is difficult.

22:39.420 --> 22:43.820
The big problem with me for deplatforming is that, to deplatform somebody, it almost

22:43.820 --> 22:50.420
feels like you're saying, my philosophy is objectively superior to yours, because what

22:50.420 --> 22:54.120
I need is I need an argument by which I can deplatform another that wouldn't allow me

22:54.120 --> 22:56.420
to get deplatformed, because I wouldn't want to be deplatformed, right?

22:56.420 --> 23:02.740
So how would society deplatform people, like, if society were to do it?

23:02.740 --> 23:06.780
For example, Twitter would deplatform people by, if you share fake news or something, like,

23:06.980 --> 23:07.980
these would be my criterion, right?

23:07.980 --> 23:11.500
Like, if you post lies or something like that, you'd be deplatformed on Twitter or something,

23:11.500 --> 23:13.140
they would ban your accounts or something like that.

23:13.140 --> 23:13.900
I don't know.

23:13.900 --> 23:17.220
You'd have to be very rigid and very specific in your set of criteria.

23:17.220 --> 23:22.740
For somebody like Warski, like, how is he supposed to platform somebody responsibly?

23:22.740 --> 23:26.860
Like, what would he do to actually not be a Nazi?

23:26.860 --> 23:32.620
Oh, so I'm not even on that, like, platforming people responsibly?

23:32.620 --> 23:34.620
Like, I, maybe.

23:34.620 --> 23:37.660
I don't know if Andy's, like, if you bring on a bunch of Nazis and you don't challenge

23:37.660 --> 23:41.140
their opinion, I don't consider that to be falling under the purview of what I would

23:41.140 --> 23:42.300
be going after.

23:42.300 --> 23:48.300
It would be going after people who are intentionally or with gross negligence or recklessness spreading

23:48.300 --> 23:49.300
fake news.

23:49.300 --> 23:52.500
That would be, like, my starting ground, and that's the only part that I'm at right now.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.500
So, like, if somebody wants to come on and argue, like, listen, I want to create an ethno-state,

23:56.500 --> 23:59.860
I want to get all the blacks and all the Mexicans out of here, like, fine, that's fine.

23:59.860 --> 24:02.540
That person gets a platform, they can argue their shit, I love free speech.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.140
It's a goddamn beautiful thing.

24:04.140 --> 24:07.260
But if that guy wants to get up and make that argument by spreading a bunch of bullshit

24:07.260 --> 24:11.620
news around, by linking to fucking Breitbart articles that have bullshit sources, by quoting

24:11.620 --> 24:15.260
headlines and sniping data and not really making an honest argument, fuck that guy.

24:15.260 --> 24:16.260
Take him out.

24:16.260 --> 24:21.100
So when you say Worsky doesn't, or he's irresponsibly platforming people, should he not be allowed

24:21.100 --> 24:22.900
to carry on that platform, or?

24:22.900 --> 24:26.340
Oh, no, Andy can, um, Andy can platform whoever he wants.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.260
I just don't like that he doesn't acknowledge the reality of it.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.260
I mean, if he, I don't think it should be, like, illegal.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.260
Oh, yeah, now it's an immoral issue.

24:31.260 --> 24:32.260
Yeah, yeah.

24:32.260 --> 24:33.260
One.

24:33.380 --> 24:41.380
Right, I feel like, though, like, um, some countries really, like, yeah, I feel like

24:41.380 --> 24:48.780
America has a good freedom of press, freedom of speech, and you don't think that any other

24:48.780 --> 24:55.740
country should adopt, or rather, reverse, you don't think we should adopt any of the...

24:55.740 --> 24:59.700
I don't know, like, shit like the Germany shit, like, makes me pretty wary, like, that

24:59.700 --> 25:02.180
you can't even do, like, that hail Hitler salute, or you can get in trouble, you can

25:02.180 --> 25:03.180
get fined for that.

25:03.180 --> 25:05.180
Why does that make you weary?

25:05.180 --> 25:08.300
I don't know, because I, fuck, if I want to go outside and do the hail Hitler salute,

25:08.300 --> 25:09.820
I don't want to get in trouble by the state.

25:09.820 --> 25:11.140
It's fucking crazy to me.

25:11.140 --> 25:12.180
Fuck that shit.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.180
I'm a free goddamn American.

25:14.180 --> 25:18.780
Well, you're a free American who supports responsible platforming.

25:18.780 --> 25:24.060
Yeah, but supporting responsible platforming doesn't mean that I explicitly or implicitly

25:24.060 --> 25:27.140
support, like, throwing people in jail for shit.

25:27.140 --> 25:31.620
Well, wait, there is a, there's a thing where, like, a line that, irresponsible, irresponsibly

25:32.220 --> 25:34.140
speech could get you thrown in prison.

25:34.140 --> 25:40.260
I don't agree with that, unless it's literally, like, direct calls to harm or something.

25:40.260 --> 25:41.260
How indirect could you get?

25:41.260 --> 25:43.260
I don't fucking know.

25:43.260 --> 25:44.260
It's up to the courts to decide.

25:44.260 --> 25:49.340
Like, if there was a, if there was a march, and they chanted, kill all Jews, or killed

25:49.340 --> 25:52.580
the Jews, is that direct, or?

25:52.580 --> 25:54.460
That sounds pretty direct to me, yeah, sure.

25:54.460 --> 25:58.580
Anytime you're saying kill, and then something, it's probably over the line, right?

25:58.580 --> 26:01.580
Yeah, no, yeah, that makes sense.

26:01.580 --> 26:02.580
Yeah.

26:02.580 --> 26:05.060
So what's your opinion of hate speech laws?

26:05.060 --> 26:07.500
I don't know, I would have to think really hard about it.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.580
My gut tells me that I think they're bad.

26:09.580 --> 26:14.220
I feel like the hate speech laws are there to give that pre-, not necessarily preemptive

26:14.220 --> 26:21.700
strike, but, like, when speeches basically kill all, kill all of, you know, this group.

26:21.700 --> 26:22.700
Mm-hmm.

26:22.700 --> 26:25.820
I think, I think that's why the hate speech laws are there, because they're not necessarily

26:25.820 --> 26:29.780
a threat towards any one person, but what do you charge them with otherwise?

26:29.780 --> 26:32.820
I mean, if that's what you mean by hate speech, like, just, like, directly threatening somebody,

26:32.820 --> 26:36.180
then I'm probably- Well, no, no, right, it's, it's, it's more

26:36.180 --> 26:38.940
broad than just that, but- Sure.

26:38.940 --> 26:43.140
I think it covers a lot of, um, areas that need to be covered.

26:43.140 --> 26:47.140
Why aren't you a socialist?

26:47.140 --> 26:48.140
I love capitalism.

26:48.140 --> 26:54.260
Why can't you have a capitalist market system under socialist means?

26:54.260 --> 26:57.620
I mean, doesn't capitalism also speak to things like labor and whatnot?

26:57.620 --> 27:00.660
Which, and it doesn't let all that labor and everything work fundamentally differently

27:00.660 --> 27:01.660
in a socialist system?

27:01.660 --> 27:09.260
Sure, but wouldn't labor be more, um, well, couldn't unions be a form of-

27:09.260 --> 27:14.220
Um, but unions don't oftentimes- Well, hold on, I have to think about whether or not,

27:14.220 --> 27:16.780
do unions represent market power or not?

27:16.780 --> 27:20.120
Um, basically, whenever I ask, whenever I think about a question like this, what I'm

27:20.120 --> 27:22.660
trying to think of is, is there a market failure?

27:22.660 --> 27:26.340
And if there's a market failure, I'm always okay with, with some sort of government intervention,

27:26.340 --> 27:27.340
right?

27:27.340 --> 27:30.300
So, just to trigger x skills me in the, in the chat, something like net neutrality, I

27:30.300 --> 27:34.580
would consider the, um, the natural, the, the ISP's being prone to being naturalistic

27:34.580 --> 27:37.080
monopolies, I would consider that a form of market failure.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.260
And market failures, I think, should always be remedied by some sort of government policy.

27:40.260 --> 27:45.380
So, would a company being too big to have any threat of, of unionizing happen, and where

27:45.380 --> 27:46.380
no other companies could compete?

27:46.380 --> 27:49.280
I mean, if that market failure existed, then yeah, I would be okay with remedying that

27:49.280 --> 27:50.280
with government shit.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.280
Does that make sense?

27:52.280 --> 27:53.280
Yeah, that makes sense.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.280
Yeah.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.880
Um, a lot of people in chat are bringing up that they live in countries where the lines

27:56.880 --> 27:59.280
are shared and, and ISPs have to rent the lines.

27:59.280 --> 28:03.560
I mean, like, that seems like the reasonable thing for me, like, it's, it's infrastructure

28:03.560 --> 28:06.600
that the whole city should care about because pretty much everybody has internet, so I'm

28:06.600 --> 28:08.160
okay publicly paying for it.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.200
We want to keep the lines running well, and then an ISP can open a data center and they

28:11.200 --> 28:14.280
can run, you know, they can hook up at the last, you know, towards them.

28:17.680 --> 28:18.680
Yeah, yeah.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.680
So, so do you think U.S. should go in that direction?

28:21.680 --> 28:22.680
We should start at least.

28:22.680 --> 28:23.680
Probably.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.680
Yeah.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.680
Well, well, you sounded really hesitant there, buddy.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.180
Well, because everything, everything is informed, everything is informed by the data.

28:32.180 --> 28:36.180
I don't know, like, if, if, if shit turns bad, then no, but like, that seems like a

28:36.180 --> 28:40.180
good, a good thing to me, I think.

28:40.180 --> 28:43.520
That seems like a good direction forward, but maybe there, there might be a better argument

28:43.520 --> 28:47.000
against it, but yeah, because I don't, I don't know what the argument would be for having

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
independent lines or everybody owning their own lines or whatever.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.400
It just seems like a huge fucking waste.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.780
There's nothing really too bombastic in this video.

28:53.780 --> 28:54.780
No big blowout.

28:54.780 --> 28:59.000
White Nervosa just kind of meekly says, okay, after getting pushed back every single time.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.360
It feels like she wants to pull him to the left, but also doesn't want to jeopardize

29:02.360 --> 29:03.560
her connection to him.

29:03.560 --> 29:06.240
Some of you might be saying, Dev, you're reading into this way too much.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.720
How can you possibly know that?

29:07.720 --> 29:11.780
Well, I know it because of a conversation that White Nervosa had with Vosh on her channel

29:11.780 --> 29:16.320
a year later on March 12th, 2019 titled, um, to kill cops.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.900
This is White Nervosa's first encounter with Vosh, and it's from this meeting that becoming

29:19.900 --> 29:22.960
a moderator and creating his website with the forked code that would eventually become

29:22.960 --> 29:24.340
White Leaf would spring.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.480
There's a few interesting things in this conversation.

29:26.480 --> 29:31.520
One, White Nervosa and Vosh both consider liberals, fascists, centrists, and rightists

29:31.520 --> 29:32.800
to all be the same thing.

29:32.800 --> 29:36.920
Kind of like how some rightoids think that all liberals, socialists, centrists, and leftists

29:36.920 --> 29:38.040
are the same thing as well.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.120
It's just centrism, right?

29:40.120 --> 29:43.960
It's just the typical centrist, right?

29:43.960 --> 29:51.920
That's just like, like until they die, you know, both sides are radical and both sides

29:51.920 --> 29:56.680
are equal and both sides need to come together.

29:56.680 --> 30:00.440
Even though one side is literally Nazis.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.440
Yeah.

30:01.440 --> 30:05.720
Um, I mean, that sounds like some of the centrists that I've discussed in the past.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.800
It is, it is fucking incredible to me.

30:08.800 --> 30:14.160
It's amazing how, um, how subjective centrism is these days.

30:14.160 --> 30:19.640
Um, Nazism sure is closer to the center than I, uh, than I originally interpreted.

30:19.640 --> 30:20.640
Yeah.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.640
Like, holy shit.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.920
I just can't even tokens like Dave Rubin, right?

30:24.920 --> 30:27.520
Like he's a liberal, right?

30:27.520 --> 30:31.200
And like these are his talking points and the same thing with Candace Owens and the

30:31.200 --> 30:36.160
same thing with Ben Shapiro and the same thing with, um, yeah, like it just goes on and on.

30:36.200 --> 30:39.880
But yeah, like I think like the biggest problem is people don't perceive how like harmful

30:39.880 --> 30:44.400
it is to public discourse and like centrism is fucking cancer for that.

30:44.400 --> 30:51.080
Just the ignorance of like, uh, the Overton window and again, like crypto fascism and

30:51.080 --> 30:52.920
I mean, I don't like, I don't know.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.200
Like I fucking hate, I fucking hate him.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.360
I hate him so goddamn much, fascists and centrists.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.360
I don't know.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.360
I don't know how to improve.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.360
It just doesn't make any sense.

31:01.760 --> 31:07.840
Cause I feel like every demonstrable study shows like, like these are, this is supposed

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
to be the facts over feels crowd.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.960
Nope, centrists have never read a study in their entire life.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.640
You can drop that right now.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.840
None of them have ever read a single study.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.480
Like centrists will acknowledge like psychological pitfalls, but then like they always fall back

31:22.480 --> 31:27.920
on this weird, like, so, so it is like they are still right wing because they still always

31:27.920 --> 31:30.480
fall back onto individual like responsibility.

31:30.480 --> 31:36.360
Like, like, like for fascism, I view the only means is violence.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.840
You can only defeat fascism with violence, right?

31:38.840 --> 31:41.200
There is no argument.

31:41.200 --> 31:46.760
There's no, like, like the centrist will always be drifted towards fascism.

31:46.760 --> 31:51.600
So the only way to combat it is to dissuade fascists from protesting.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.360
So you have to hit them with violence.

31:57.920 --> 32:01.760
Does not exist in America because there is no revolutionary movement and how they want

32:01.760 --> 32:02.760
to be a part of one.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.200
I think like, I don't fucking know.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.000
Like what makes a person want to be centrist?

32:07.000 --> 32:11.200
Is it they, they were like a conservative, but conservatism is a cool because the average

32:11.200 --> 32:13.560
age of Republican in America is 900.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.920
So they want to be like the edgy fucking libertarian centrist.

32:16.920 --> 32:21.680
Is it because they once went to a college campus and they think they're kind of liberal

32:21.680 --> 32:26.360
and then like some, a woman with blue hair yelled at them and now they're assuming like

32:26.360 --> 32:27.640
I don't, I don't know.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.800
Whatever it is, it stems from ignorance or stupidity or fear.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.440
It's like, like a little bit of just stunning Kruger, right?

32:34.440 --> 32:39.160
They, they just know like a little bit about politics and they think they know so much.

32:39.160 --> 32:44.960
Like they think they see like the extreme left and the extreme right, but like they've

32:44.960 --> 32:50.200
just made this like fossil equivocation that just doesn't exist.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.400
Like there is no extreme left.

32:52.400 --> 32:56.280
We will become the extreme left and we will stride across this great land, um, seize the

32:56.280 --> 32:57.440
means of production.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.440
You know?

32:58.440 --> 32:59.440
Oh yeah.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.440
Yeah.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.440
Okay.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.440
Yeah.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.440
Let's well, yeah.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.200
I mean, you know, I mean, I'd say like, you know, the car was going down the wrong street

33:07.200 --> 33:11.240
and you know, Charlottesville, you know, it's just White, Nervosa and Vosh talk about how

33:11.240 --> 33:15.560
while a far left party winning elections would be ideal, a revolutionary movement of working

33:15.560 --> 33:19.600
class people, uh, storming the seat of government is also good too.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.600
As long as they're leftist.

33:20.600 --> 33:25.180
Of course, I think we need at least another century, maybe a century and a half of class

33:25.180 --> 33:29.160
consciousness spreading amongst the pros before we're ready to have a revolution.

33:29.160 --> 33:34.700
And when it happens, I would like it to happen in conjunction with a far left political party

33:34.700 --> 33:40.520
gaining prominence in the legislator, which would be able to secure a clean transition

33:40.520 --> 33:46.380
of power rather than the literal like citizens up revolt against the entire United States

33:46.380 --> 33:50.700
military storming Washington, taking control of the, uh, oval office.

33:50.700 --> 33:56.380
Um, you know, broadcasting a message of victory to the rest of the American people.

33:56.380 --> 34:02.380
I hope that in the future, the material circumstances eventually arrive at a point where, um, where

34:02.380 --> 34:04.300
they feel revolution is possible.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.300
They're okay.

34:05.300 --> 34:10.340
If police die during this uprising, I presume you're not in favor of outlawing armor piercing

34:10.340 --> 34:11.340
bullets.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.340
Fuck that.

34:12.340 --> 34:16.080
The only people who wear armor are cops.

34:16.080 --> 34:26.520
They're hoping for a revolution that may occur in more than a century, but in the meantime,

34:26.520 --> 34:29.400
we have bullets designed explicitly to kill cops.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.920
Oh, I mean, yeah.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:32.640 --> 34:36.200
Just because I advocate for a revolution in the future doesn't mean I'm not okay with

34:36.200 --> 34:37.920
cop killing now.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.480
But at the same time, they also don't want individuals to actually own guns.

34:41.480 --> 34:46.060
They want the guns to be owned by the community and kept in a community armory, which is just

34:46.060 --> 34:49.060
the state owning all the guns again with a new label attached.

34:49.060 --> 34:51.540
But ideally I wouldn't like guns to be kept in the house.

34:51.540 --> 34:58.220
I would like there to be like, uh, community armories, um, that neighborhoods would have

34:58.220 --> 35:02.740
where like, if there was ever a need to, uh, you could go to this like sort of collectively

35:02.740 --> 35:07.380
owned bunker maintained by the community and you've got your fucking mousins and F4s and

35:07.380 --> 35:08.380
shit.

35:08.380 --> 35:14.380
For rebranding, I think like, uh, you could pitch it as just a shooting range, right?

35:14.380 --> 35:17.440
Like you can even own like a automatic weapons, right?

35:17.440 --> 35:21.660
Just lock them up at the shooting range and then you go grenade launchers.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.120
Absolutely own that shit.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.120
Grenade launchers.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.860
I want the fucking anti-tank mines.

35:25.860 --> 35:31.060
I want the God, I want the sniper rifles that can penetrate, um, police, uh, car doors.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.060
I want all that shit.

35:32.060 --> 35:33.220
I want them stock block.

35:33.220 --> 35:34.580
I want the fucking barrel.

35:34.580 --> 35:39.460
I want the barrel, the chamber loaded as you pick up the gun.

35:39.460 --> 35:40.740
I want us to be ready.

35:40.740 --> 35:44.820
They also have no real concern with what happens after the revolution either, as long as it

35:44.820 --> 35:47.380
moves the world ever more leftward.

35:47.380 --> 35:52.100
Is your end game to abolish the state wholesale?

35:52.100 --> 35:55.020
I don't really care what happens after we overthrow capitalism.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.260
The material circumstances of the time will dictate what comes next.

35:58.260 --> 36:00.920
I just want to see us move forward, move leftward.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.460
And by the way, they don't believe that democracy can do this.

36:03.460 --> 36:08.300
I reject the idea that electoralism is the means by which we can overthrow the hold police

36:08.300 --> 36:10.320
have on disenfranchised communities.

36:10.320 --> 36:14.720
And finally, White, Nervosa and Vashj describe hiding their true beliefs and subverting this

36:14.720 --> 36:15.720
system from the outside.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.800
Like, couldn't you like falsely moralize that to yourself though?

36:18.800 --> 36:22.720
Because I feel like I could very easily fall into that like psychological trap where I

36:22.720 --> 36:30.280
could like moralize myself or, you know, say that I'm not doing tangible harm to public

36:30.280 --> 36:31.280
discourse.

36:31.280 --> 36:36.280
I'm just doing it for a paycheck to feed my family and to further like my own personal

36:36.280 --> 36:37.280
goals.

36:37.280 --> 36:41.840
I don't know if I could justify it ethically under my own like personal set of values,

36:41.840 --> 36:47.720
but I do know, I think the only way that I could come away from that thinking like, okay,

36:47.720 --> 36:51.200
maybe I'm not going to blow my brains out in this gas station bathroom.

36:51.200 --> 36:58.320
The only way I could come out feeling like I'm not doing that is if I thought like, okay,

36:58.320 --> 37:03.720
I'm building power from within, but one day I will unveil my true power level.

37:03.720 --> 37:07.160
Personally on a personal level, I do not think that I could do it unless I had some

37:07.160 --> 37:11.560
sort of like secret underlying motive, some way in which I felt I was actually supporting

37:11.560 --> 37:12.720
the leftist cause.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.800
I understand how other people could do it though.

37:14.800 --> 37:21.880
Not everyone is as politically enfranchised as you or I have such strongly formed opinions,

37:21.880 --> 37:24.000
such a firm understanding of theory.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.640
The most refreshing part of all of this is seeing a more mask off Vashj than he is nowadays.

37:29.640 --> 37:38.520
So then if you believe that Republicans have intent right now to bring about an LGBT genocide,

37:38.520 --> 37:43.720
how can you morally object against people right now taking arms and going out and killing

37:43.720 --> 37:44.960
Republican lawmakers?

37:44.960 --> 37:45.960
Exactly.

37:45.960 --> 37:46.960
Republican lawmakers?

37:46.960 --> 37:47.960
Yes.

37:47.960 --> 37:51.000
Well, it would be a utilitarian thing, wouldn't it?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Oh God, stop.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Stop.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
Which unfortunately I don't really think it's possible to know that because I'm not God,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.040
but as a general rule, that type of thing doesn't tend to work out.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.040
But there are plenty of examples-

38:02.040 --> 38:10.580
Ask him this, if it did work out, if they were able to kill lawmakers with no consequences,

38:10.580 --> 38:14.000
would it be morally justified, question mark?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.640
You know, are a legitimate-

38:15.640 --> 38:16.640
Ask him.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.640
Let's hear it.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.640
Make him answer our question.

38:18.640 --> 38:22.080
... are trying to use that power to suppress minority groups.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.680
You talked about the utilitarian thing before.

38:23.680 --> 38:29.360
So if it would be possible, if it were to be possible to get away with killing Republican

38:29.360 --> 38:31.880
lawmakers with no consequences, would it then be-

38:31.880 --> 38:33.840
Are you actually fed posting at me right now?

38:33.840 --> 38:34.840
You're glowing in this convo.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
Wait, are you being fed these questions?

38:35.840 --> 38:37.240
Ah, he won't answer that question.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.240
I knew he wouldn't.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.400
I knew he wouldn't answer that question.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.440
He won't do it.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.440
He won't do it.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.960
What a fucking weaselly little coward.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.200
2023, Vosh is too scared to say what he really thinks.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.700
He likes the Twitch bucks too much, so he hides his power level.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.340
And Vosh on IRL panels?

38:51.340 --> 38:52.340
Forget it.

38:52.340 --> 38:54.700
The milk toast progressive opinions you can imagine.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.820
If you look at any major social movement, you will see disinformation.

38:57.820 --> 39:01.780
That was the case with BLM, that was the case with the civil rights movement, the suffragette

39:01.780 --> 39:05.620
movement, the abolitionist movement, the American revolution, and everything prior to it.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.300
Misinformation is just a part and parcel.

39:07.300 --> 39:11.100
If you try to minimize it, but at the end of the day, it is something that will be produced

39:11.100 --> 39:12.700
and sometimes focused on.

39:12.700 --> 39:16.660
You have to take a look at the underlying social motivations and the processes that

39:16.660 --> 39:17.660
led to that.

39:17.660 --> 39:22.140
So with regards to the January 6th stuff, again, you can, as you said, normalize very

39:22.140 --> 39:26.000
terrible stuff with the wrong descriptive understanding of the world.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.700
You can take just about every heinous totalitarian ideology that's ever festered on this planet,

39:31.700 --> 39:35.960
you know, whether you want to go Nazism or Stalinist, Pol Pot, wherever you want to go.

39:35.960 --> 39:41.460
If you fed a person the right set of facts about the world, big air quotes, by the way,

39:41.460 --> 39:44.940
you could approximate those ideologies in them.

39:44.940 --> 39:48.120
Compare that take to this one and you'll see exactly what I mean.

39:48.120 --> 39:51.900
There is not a good base of conservatives in this country.

39:51.900 --> 39:54.240
These people are no different from the Ku Klux Klan.

39:54.240 --> 39:59.220
They are no different from the fucking white nationalists who ran terror campaigns in the

39:59.220 --> 40:01.560
South back during the 1920s, 30s, 40s.

40:01.560 --> 40:05.780
They are absolutely no different from the frothing at the mouth screaming fucking pasty

40:05.780 --> 40:10.380
male people who are throwing rocks at black folk going to integrated schools.

40:10.380 --> 40:11.780
There is no difference.

40:11.780 --> 40:15.400
If you have a conservative family member, I'm sorry, they're part of the problem.

40:15.400 --> 40:18.100
If you have a conservative friend, I'm sorry, they're part of the problem.

40:18.100 --> 40:20.760
History will crush these people beneath its feet.

40:20.760 --> 40:24.400
Every single time a political party has tried this shit, every single time they've gone

40:24.400 --> 40:28.480
down this road, they have been reviled through the generations.

40:28.480 --> 40:31.020
There is no good history for these people.

40:31.020 --> 40:34.560
And every conservative, every Republican is on the hook for this.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.800
Every last one of them.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.620
These people present one view when they're in real life and being challenged directly

40:39.620 --> 40:44.200
and another view entirely when they feel like only their community, their people are watching

40:44.200 --> 40:46.480
and they're safe from the eyes of outsiders.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.640
They are just as subversive as the fascists they claim to oppose.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.840
They tell the big lie just as much.

40:51.840 --> 40:55.360
They too hide their real politics until the moment is right.

40:55.360 --> 40:59.280
Three, stemming from their subversiveness, White-Nervosa and Vosch both admit that the

40:59.280 --> 41:03.640
reason they hang around destiny is to convert him to their political beliefs and to pull

41:03.640 --> 41:06.040
his audience into their sphere of influence.

41:06.040 --> 41:13.080
I've seen like, yeah, you go toe to toe with destiny on economics and I kind of accidentally

41:13.080 --> 41:18.760
push him further away because I pushed him towards getting rid of minimum wage.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.280
Oh no.

41:21.280 --> 41:26.640
I think, I honestly, the best way to radicalize destiny and leftward is to, if you're a leftist,

41:26.640 --> 41:32.560
is to not talk with him because he gets really fucking angry and defensive talking to leftists.

41:32.560 --> 41:37.000
I feel, I almost feel for him because he, he's like, cause he's a lib boy, you know,

41:37.000 --> 41:45.080
he's a good old lib guy and, and because he gets popular debating on these idiot right-wingers,

41:45.080 --> 41:47.560
he'll like sort of throw him in with the lefties.

41:47.560 --> 41:52.000
But now he feels like this performative need to distance himself from them so he can stand

41:52.000 --> 41:57.320
alone on his own little, like, yeah, yeah, he definitely loves, like it, it's almost

41:57.320 --> 42:02.680
like a virtue signal, like that he loves to like say like, oh man, I guess you're a communist,

42:02.680 --> 42:03.680
right?

42:03.680 --> 42:09.400
Like, like, like, uh, in a condescending way in a discussion, um, we'll get them one day.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.400
Yeah.

42:10.400 --> 42:16.360
I mean, well, I, I feel like, like, like, again, like just by accident, right?

42:16.360 --> 42:23.640
Just by him, I mean, cause fuck, he used to be a libertarian, so he's on the right track.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.720
He just has to get there.

42:25.720 --> 42:29.640
White Nervosa also decries the equivalence between the radical left and the radical right

42:29.640 --> 42:33.840
as a symptom of fascism, which destiny did in their previous conversation, but she was

42:33.840 --> 42:35.160
too cucked to speak up about.

42:35.160 --> 42:39.120
Like Dave Rubin, I think it's an easy example that shouldn't have a platform.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.640
Well, no, I'm not sure I would have to think about Ruben.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.520
So again, I want to be really, really, really careful here.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.520
Okay.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.800
So remember primarily my value system is usually going after what is true.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.240
I don't care about political agendas.

42:49.240 --> 42:52.080
I have no desire to push a political agenda whatsoever.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.080
I don't care.

42:53.080 --> 42:54.520
I have no interest, no desire.

42:54.520 --> 42:57.800
So I think that all offensive ideas should be spoken about.

42:57.800 --> 43:02.960
So pedophilia, incest, Ku Klux Klan, Nazism, ethno states, all of that shit, communism,

43:02.960 --> 43:03.960
whatever the fuck.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.640
All of these ideas should be up for discussion.

43:05.640 --> 43:06.640
I'm okay with that.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.840
And I'm okay with people providing a platform to discuss these ideas.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.200
The ideas don't bother me.

43:11.200 --> 43:17.160
It's just engaging in disinformation or misinformation or reckless, like reckless reporting that

43:17.160 --> 43:19.360
is like horrendously disingenuous.

43:21.360 --> 43:26.880
Yeah, I don't have, I don't want to name drop too many people, but the reason I specifically

43:26.880 --> 43:32.760
think of Ruben instantly is because he really, really interviews a lot of people who are

43:32.760 --> 43:38.640
far to the alt-right and even further so, and I feel like platforming those people and

43:38.640 --> 43:45.640
giving them just basically a softball interview to pitch their platform, I feel like really

43:45.640 --> 43:47.840
does a disservice to everybody that's watching.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.120
I don't, I don't agree with that.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.320
I mean, it gets the ideas out there.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.720
Even if you might find them offensive or horrible, it just gets the ideas out.

43:53.720 --> 43:56.440
I mean, do you make all softball interviews illegal then or?

43:56.440 --> 44:01.360
Well, no, not at all, but I mean, isn't that, isn't that your point though?

44:01.360 --> 44:05.040
Cause isn't that sort of fake news on, on steroids.

44:05.040 --> 44:06.040
No, I don't think so.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.040
The pinnacle of that.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.040
Well, like, so here's a question.

44:08.040 --> 44:11.320
If you want to go after people that give softball interviews to extremists, what about somebody

44:11.320 --> 44:15.400
that has a channel where they interview like Contra points or the interview Sean and January

44:15.400 --> 44:21.120
somebody, and they give them all softball questions, would that be no, I feel like that's

44:21.120 --> 44:22.120
entirely different.

44:22.120 --> 44:29.160
If your channel, give me some, wow, very clearly a stilted, uh, slant, you know, you're just

44:29.160 --> 44:30.160
an interview channel.

44:30.160 --> 44:34.840
But Dave Rubin, I don't feel like is presented as such as it's presented as the marketplace

44:34.840 --> 44:37.280
of ideas, which it very clearly isn't.

44:37.280 --> 44:38.280
Yeah.

44:38.280 --> 44:39.280
Maybe.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.280
I don't know.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.280
I guess it's, it's, I like to focus on branding and presentation.

44:41.280 --> 44:44.520
I like to focus on fake news because I can do a hard line objective.

44:44.520 --> 44:45.840
Like this is bullshit.

44:45.840 --> 44:48.040
You're screenshotting article headlines.

44:48.040 --> 44:49.720
You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.880
Like you're, you're lying to your teeth.

44:51.880 --> 44:56.400
That's easy to target saying somebody like Dave Rubin, disingenuously, disingenuously

44:56.400 --> 44:57.400
presents as policy.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.680
I feel like that line is a lot harder to walk.

45:00.680 --> 45:03.200
Yeah, maybe so.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.200
Maybe.

45:04.200 --> 45:09.800
So this is all a year and a half before destiny and Vash stopped publicly being friends after

45:09.800 --> 45:14.200
that infamous Kyle Rittenhouse debate destiny always described Vash as his friend, white

45:14.200 --> 45:18.960
nervosa spent time in his community as a noted orbiter, but it seems to be increasingly obvious,

45:18.960 --> 45:23.680
at least to me that these people were simply using him the whole time for, and to tie it

45:23.680 --> 45:28.480
all into one neat package, Vash and white nervosa advocate for direct violence against

45:28.480 --> 45:32.400
fascists, keeping in mind that to them, fascists are not only fascists, but liberals, centrists

45:32.400 --> 45:33.400
and rightists.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.680
And she even readmits as much in the statement.

45:35.680 --> 45:42.880
And I feel like we can win on like, like socialism because emotional appeals or emotional propaganda

45:42.880 --> 45:43.880
is very, very easy.

45:43.880 --> 45:47.360
How do you win on like against fascism?

45:47.360 --> 45:51.760
Like, because that's a really tough, like, you know, they, they show like the other and

45:51.760 --> 45:56.280
they're going to take, you know, your kid's job, like, I mean, I don't, I don't think

45:56.280 --> 45:57.480
you can argue with fascists.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.080
I think they just need to be killed or something.

45:59.080 --> 46:04.160
I don't disagree with you, but I mean, like from a, like for attacking, uh, like centrists,

46:04.160 --> 46:10.320
like how do you attack, especially since it's so crypto in the first place, like, like it's

46:10.320 --> 46:13.720
not usually Charlottesville and like it's a wordness.

46:13.720 --> 46:19.080
I mean, ideally I think a lot of centrists are crypto fascist too, and they get the bullet

46:19.080 --> 46:20.080
as well.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.640
But the system we live in today is full of violence as it exists.

46:23.640 --> 46:24.640
And to ignore that.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.640
Yeah.

46:25.640 --> 46:26.640
Oh God.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.640
That fucking triggers me.

46:27.640 --> 46:28.640
This is literally nothing.

46:28.640 --> 46:34.280
Well, like, I mean, people don't realize that a government is just a society agreeing on

46:34.280 --> 46:35.280
violence.

46:35.280 --> 46:41.520
Like, you know, like, like if guns are being passed around, like fucking, I mean, I, like,

46:41.520 --> 46:44.320
I don't know, fucking well, like let's go.

46:44.320 --> 46:48.280
What matters is if you see me in the street with my Mosin, okay, what matters is that

46:49.280 --> 46:50.280
I join you with two.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.280
Okay.

46:51.280 --> 46:52.280
All right.

46:52.280 --> 46:53.280
Yeah.

46:53.280 --> 46:54.280
My fucking comrades.

46:54.280 --> 46:58.400
Hey, destiny being a liberal is only there to either be subverted or destroyed.

46:58.400 --> 47:02.160
And because they both failed to subvert him and they're both too bitch baby to actually

47:02.160 --> 47:06.080
do anything outside their own houses, destroying him online is the next best thing.

47:06.080 --> 47:10.500
With all of this additional context, look at white nervosa statement on the Rose wrist

47:10.500 --> 47:15.400
thing again, allow this to be a larger statement on those who look towards DGG for a place

47:15.400 --> 47:18.000
to be rather than a place to move on from.

47:18.720 --> 47:19.720
They don't watch your content.

47:19.720 --> 47:20.720
Never.

47:20.720 --> 47:21.720
You're nothing but a tool to them.

47:21.720 --> 47:22.720
This isn't picking sides.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.640
This is understanding that DGG isn't a place for growth.

47:24.640 --> 47:25.840
On the one hand, you're entirely wrong.

47:25.840 --> 47:29.680
There's a ton of content creators who have benefited greatly from the destiny bump, erudite,

47:29.680 --> 47:32.880
stardust, counterpoints, even vosh, but the difference is that they took the exposure

47:32.880 --> 47:37.200
destiny gave them and then made something that was new, something that was them using

47:37.200 --> 47:38.640
the opportunity properly.

47:38.640 --> 47:43.400
White nervosa didn't like DK said, everything she's done is simply a copy of the work of

47:43.400 --> 47:44.400
better people.

47:44.400 --> 47:48.200
On the other hand, though, this mindset of white nervosas pretty much proves my point

47:48.200 --> 47:51.040
that her and her crowd are just users.

47:51.040 --> 47:55.040
To them, DGG is a stepping stone to appeal to when it builds them up and to attack when

47:55.040 --> 47:56.040
it builds them up.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.620
Vash and Asan did this to destiny.

47:57.620 --> 48:00.700
A bunch of crumb tubers did it too, book smarts, Merrick, Xanderhal.

48:00.700 --> 48:02.960
This is also what's happening to chud logic right now.

48:02.960 --> 48:06.880
And now that twitch politics has become an insular lefty only space, they're turning

48:06.880 --> 48:09.080
on each other for clout as they always do.

48:09.080 --> 48:13.020
Right now, as I'm recording this bad bunny and keffles are getting into a fight because

48:13.020 --> 48:16.280
they're both fucking irrelevant, contributing nothing of substance to anything.

48:16.280 --> 48:20.220
And despite their public exclamations of commitment to the leftist cause, they're only here

48:20.220 --> 48:21.220
to make money.

48:21.220 --> 48:25.980
And yes, underneath all of the rhetoric, that's all it is for any of these leftoids.

48:25.980 --> 48:29.780
You don't need to actually build socialism if you're a rich socialist because you've

48:29.780 --> 48:31.180
got the correct beliefs.

48:31.180 --> 48:35.260
So whatever is a good consequentialist end for you is what the good is.

48:35.260 --> 48:39.060
In fact, with white nervosa, it's even more blatant because the main reason she even tried

48:39.060 --> 48:43.000
to be a streamer before the whole white forest thing is so that she could stream snipe other

48:43.000 --> 48:46.440
people's auto-hosts and turn those donations into cocaine.

48:46.440 --> 48:49.940
And no, this isn't just some Kiwi Farms rumor, though they get a kick out of it too.

48:49.940 --> 48:52.160
This is something that is actually confirmed by her.

48:52.160 --> 48:58.960
Yeah, I mean, I just love the EU streams, I'm trying to jack the auto-hosts from everybody

48:58.960 --> 49:01.560
else so, you know, we start early as fuck.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.900
Listen, just know that if you support the White Leaf Project, all that money is going

49:04.900 --> 49:06.500
straight up her nose.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.480
At this point, let's check out the big picture.

49:08.480 --> 49:12.640
White Nervosa is a core part of Vasha's community, paid by him to rip off Destiny's

49:12.680 --> 49:15.400
code for his, and later, all of BreadTube's use.

49:15.400 --> 49:19.520
This entire group shares the same ethics, which constitute a violent support of revolutionary

49:19.520 --> 49:23.640
leftism without any concern of the actual behaviors involved, or concern for any of

49:23.640 --> 49:25.760
the outcomes beyond what is simply good for them.

49:25.760 --> 49:28.920
And beneath that mask, what is good is whatever makes them money.

49:28.920 --> 49:32.640
And people who disagree with what they consider the good to be exist only to be exploited

49:32.640 --> 49:36.280
by them, to either be converted to their cause or discarded and destroyed.

49:36.280 --> 49:40.540
And in order to accomplish all of this, these people are willing to lie, to cheat, to steal,

49:40.540 --> 49:43.580
to attack you in the street if they had the opportunity, to deprive you of your income

49:43.580 --> 49:47.420
so that you and your dependents starve, to go against every stated value that they claim

49:47.420 --> 49:50.820
to hold, including things like universal human rights or democracy.

49:50.820 --> 49:55.160
There is a direct throughline between the rhetoric these people used in 2018 and 2019

49:55.160 --> 49:57.440
and their morally reprehensible behaviors today.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.460
They were always going to become this.

49:59.460 --> 50:03.540
This is why people in my area of the internet spoke out about it all those years ago.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.780
We all told Shu on head she was going to get backstabbed.

50:05.780 --> 50:06.780
She didn't believe us.

50:06.780 --> 50:07.780
And here we are.

50:07.780 --> 50:12.140
She was scamming chudlogic in like April 2022 or something, saying, I bet demon mama backstabs

50:12.140 --> 50:13.140
you within the next six months.

50:13.140 --> 50:14.540
And he was like, I don't know, man.

50:14.540 --> 50:15.820
And lo and behold, she did.

50:15.820 --> 50:19.700
When I spoke to Dylan Burns, I told him there will probably eventually be backlash for you

50:19.700 --> 50:21.740
and I talking, especially if you do it regularly.

50:21.740 --> 50:22.740
And it hasn't come yet.

50:22.740 --> 50:24.000
But, you know, it will.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.660
I don't agree with Sargon or ArchWarhammer all the time.

50:26.660 --> 50:30.740
We have some very rowdy debates in private, but we never violate the meta-ethic that is

50:30.740 --> 50:31.740
the friendship.

50:31.740 --> 50:33.660
Over some political disagreement, why would we?

50:33.660 --> 50:36.540
Even though they're drifting away from me politically, and I agree with them less and

50:36.540 --> 50:41.100
less over time, they are vastly better people than any of these BreadTube fucks.

50:41.100 --> 50:43.920
White Nervosa herself is just a blip on the radar.

50:43.920 --> 50:47.540
She will fade in the same way that Kefles is fading, now that her Drop Kiwi Farms campaign

50:47.540 --> 50:49.380
has failed spectacularly.

50:49.380 --> 50:53.260
Even if you were braindead enough to be interested in the BreadTube socialist type of thing,

50:53.260 --> 50:57.700
all of her content is just what the larger BreadTubers say, only strictly worse.

50:57.700 --> 51:00.140
Her only claim to fame is exactly as DK said.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.780
She stole the work of better people.

51:01.780 --> 51:04.300
She enriched herself, temporarily, off that work.

51:04.300 --> 51:06.880
She has no ability to innovate on that foundation.

51:06.880 --> 51:09.740
And so, when the ecosystem moves on, she will be left behind.

51:09.740 --> 51:14.660
Her one claim to fame is fleeting fast, and nothing else she's ever done has any substance

51:14.660 --> 51:15.660
whatsoever.

51:15.660 --> 51:19.140
She will one day wake up and discover that the cocaine money has dried up, nobody's

51:19.140 --> 51:23.180
keeping up with her anymore, nobody's using the few dollops of value she stole from others

51:23.180 --> 51:24.180
anymore.

51:24.180 --> 51:26.660
Theirs is a community of users, in many ways.

51:26.660 --> 51:30.180
And White Nervosa is rapidly reaching the end of her usefulness.

51:30.180 --> 51:34.060
I don't know why she thinks she won't be discarded, in the same way that she and

51:34.060 --> 51:36.260
her ilk have discarded so many others.
