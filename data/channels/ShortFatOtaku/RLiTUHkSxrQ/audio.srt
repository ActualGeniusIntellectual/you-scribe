00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello and welcome to SJ Weekly. And you know what? This is an absolute fucking disgrace,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,120
you guys, okay? So, my girlfriend had to go to work for 7 a.m. today. I was up before she was

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,880
5.30. I make her her favorite breakfast, peanut butter and banana toast. I make her the last

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,160
cup of coffee that we have, all right? There's no more coffee. And she doesn't even finish any of

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,320
this shit. So, I mean, if you guys want to slurp, this is it. I have to drink cold old coffee today.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,400
Fucking delicious. I want everyone to start shaming Naomi immediately. Those of you who've

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,160
been watching for a little while now know that the 50,000 sub mark is coming up soon. If growth

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,520
continues, probably sometime this week. So, I'm kind of curious. What do you guys want to see me

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,200
do for a 50,000 sub special? I was thinking maybe a Q&A or something. Here's what we'll do. Post

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,160
all your ideas for a 50,000 sub special video in the comments of this video. And if there's any

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,200
decent ideas, I'll consider them, okay? That's what we'll do. But let's start SJ Weekly with

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,640
this tweet from Black Hebrew Israelite. I just walked by Buzzfeed's office and some horrible

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
monster put these stickers up around the entrance. I hope the FBI investigates this

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,800
hate crime and catches the perpetrator ASAP. So, there's Buzzfeed's offices and someone put

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:47,600
learn to code stickers. Oh God, I wonder if they managed to stay there. Anybody who's in the same

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
city as Buzzfeed's offices, go see if they're there. Alternatively, go plant more. But speaking

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,760
of the Black Hebrew Israelites, here's an article from Coed. Complete and utter cuck licks boot of

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,360
hate group because he cares about justice. The group is, of course, the Black Israelites. And

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,120
look at this guy. The Black Israelites are out there protesting for black rights, for black

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,240
supremacy basically. And this white soy boy cuck decides to lick his boot to show how non-racist

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,240
he is. I know this is an older article, but nonetheless, Jesus Christ, man. This is next

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,400
level cuckery at its finest. A white guilt-ridden beta male passes by a group of Black Hebrew

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,880
Israelites and proceeds to lick a boot clean upon request. The beta male claims to care about

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,800
justice. And one preaching Israelite put this guy's SJW stats to the test and said,

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,000
so if you're really a man of justice, bow down your face to the earth and lick the dust off of

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,960
my boot. And you probably know what happened next. The beta male shrugs his shoulders,

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,320
asks if that's what they really want him to do, and then gets down on his knees to lick the boot

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,040
of the vocal Black Israelites. What the fuck, dude? Wait, there's a video?

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:34,560
What you just saw was a trailer for Black Panther 2, guys.

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,040
Let's move on to something a bit more contemporary on The Blaze. After 55,000 people show support,

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,440
a new period emoji will soon be released to destigmatize menstruation.

32
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,800
The inclusion of an emoji is a huge step towards normalizing periods. Is that really all it takes

33
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,320
nowadays? If you want a certain event or a social issue or whatever to be destigmatized

34
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,440
and normalized, you just make an emoji about it. Is that really all it takes at this point?

35
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,680
Let me just point something out. If you live with a girlfriend or a wife ever at any point

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,920
in your life, periods will stop being a mystery to you. They don't need to be destigmatized

37
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,440
or normalized at that point. So it sounds like if there's any actual serious problem

38
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,080
with the normalization of periods, it's probably among a generation or a crowd of people who

39
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,480
can't have a committed relationship. Also, Jesus Christ, the red drop emoji is fine.

40
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,880
You don't need the fucking period pad. Let's have an emoji for just shit-stained underwear.

41
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,520
Let's destigmatize and normalize shitting your pants. That sounds good.

42
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Children's rights charity Plan International UK launched the campaign for a period emoji after

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,760
conducting a 2017 survey and discovered just how much shame and stigma still impact girls

44
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,600
and women's experience of having their period. That sucks and that sounds like something they

45
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
got to get over, but I don't think an emoji will help with that. There's a reason why

46
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,160
the eggplant and the peach emojis are used for genitalia or sexual purposes, and it's because

47
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,640
you shouldn't have blatantly sexual things as universal emoji. The winning image was dubbed

48
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,520
period pants. Plan International UK submitted to the emoji powers that be at Unicode,

49
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,480
but sadly the design didn't get accepted. Good. Undeterred, Plan International UK partnered with

50
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,040
NHS Blood and Transplant and submitted its second place design, the blood droplet,

51
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,360
which was accepted. And that's fine because you know what? The blood droplet can be used

52
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,480
for multiple things. Human beings do occasionally bleed from places other than their vagina.

53
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,080
They might spin it as a period emoji, and I'm sure there's going to be some girls out there

54
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,480
who use it as a period emoji. That's definitely fine, of course. However, a red drop of liquid

55
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,720
is honestly fine. You could also have a green one if you want. I think there's probably already

56
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,880
a blue one for water. This is just a non-story. What the fuck? I can't believe I'm actually

57
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,640
talking about this nonsense. However, some people are really fucking excited about it.

58
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,240
We're getting a period emoji and it's bloody brilliant news. They say that an emoji won't

59
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,720
necessarily solve the issues surrounding period stigma and silence, but it will help change the

60
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,720
conversation and end the shame around periods. I don't know. I don't know about that, man. Like,

61
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,360
very clearly, nobody should be shamed for basic biological functions. I think we can all agree

62
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,680
on that. That makes sense, right? If your body is doing stuff that you can't control, should you be

63
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,520
shamed about it? No. Should you still have a responsibility to perform adequate maintenance

64
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,960
on your body even though it's doing things that are out of your control? Yes. That's why free

65
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,160
bleeding, for example, is so stupid. And that's why it's hilarious that a whole bunch of dumb

66
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,800
feminists fell for it when 4chan basically made it up. Men, it is completely reasonable to treat

67
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,280
period blood like it's any other type of waste product that comes out of the human body and

68
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,560
therefore is disgusting because that's exactly what it is. I mean, you probably shouldn't be

69
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,240
shamed for taking a shit, but that's no reason to celebrate taking a shit, is it? And hey,

70
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,600
that does put the period emoji in line with the poop emoji, so there you go. Good company.

71
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,280
However, while emojis can be used to empower some people, they're also meant to be used to

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,040
oppress others. For example...

73
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Finally, a new emoji to mock men. The latest batch of emojis features new possibilities

74
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,280
for shattering fragile masculinities and capitalism alike. We're going to be using

75
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,520
emojis to own capitalism now, epic style. Is that it? Is that what we're doing? Also,

76
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm pretty sure that there are more than one way to use this emoji. It's not all about

77
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,840
penis size, though I'm sure that's all Vice cares about.

78
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,560
Great news! We're finally getting an emoji that's perfect for easily humiliating men

79
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,240
when they're being disgusting online. Or, you know, being men. The small dick emoji.

80
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,720
Officially named Pinching Hand, the emoji has been approved by the Unicode Consortium

81
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,360
for release across major platforms this year. It's also great for illustrating capitalism's

82
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,920
failures by capturing the inadequate minimum wage or your lackluster salary.

83
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:50,160
The possibilities are endless. Countless men who aren't secure in their masculinity will

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,040
be affected by the new option, we know, but it was high time to replace the purple eggplant,

85
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,560
which, as a 2015 study confirmed, everyone obviously uses a dick for something more

86
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,320
realistic. Emojipedia catalogued the new emojis. The batch includes a wheelchair,

87
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,840
a gender inclusive couple, two service dogs, a yawning face, a flamingo, an orangutan,

88
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,120
a hang glider, butter, garlic, and more. I thought a lot of those were already emojis.

89
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,800
Is this an old article? Hold on a minute. No. February 6th, 2019.

90
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,760
You know what I want? I want inclusivity and equality here. I want to see a new emoji

91
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,400
to mock women. And you know what it's going to be? Just two hands making a giant circle

92
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,640
to show how gigantically wide and overused the vaginas of the women at Vice actually are.

93
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,720
And I guarantee you, once we get that emoji, there's going to be a bunch of angry women

94
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
online complaining that it is sexist. Speaking of female empowerment, I wish

95
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,320
Resident Evil 2 let me be a more compassionate hero. This is a game I pretty much passed on.

96
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,440
One of my new year's resolutions was to only play video games if I'm streaming them

97
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
on Twitch TV. And that was just one way to get me to at least be making some type of content

98
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,880
if I'm gaming, so it's not like a complete waste of time. And right now I'm just playing too many

99
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,920
games on Twitch at the moment. Hollow Knight, Kingdom Hearts, Octopath Traveler. There just

100
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,160
wasn't really room for Resident Evil 2 beyond the 30 minute demo that came out a few weeks back.

101
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,920
I'm playing Resident Evil 2 for the first time. Well, mostly. Back in 1998, my 14 year old self

102
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
scoured the pages of a Tips and Tricks magazine walkthrough of the game, covering every gameplay

103
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,360
beat and plot point. And I played a few minutes of it on a friend's PS1. So I'm familiar with

104
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,880
the scenery and the structure, the quests and the characters, but this is the first time I'm

105
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,520
experiencing it. It's scary and tense, and very much a period piece, a late 90s survival horror

106
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,520
game set squarely in the later Clinton era with dollar gallons of gas and chunky computers,

107
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,400
now boasting some modern design niceties. Playing on normal, I can save as many times as I'd like,

108
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,640
and the cutscenes and visuals are pretty adept Resident Evil 7 standards. But one thing that's

109
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,760
sticking out to me, still early on in the police station, is how perfectly the game uses scarcity

110
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,480
and this fantasy of hyper competence to make me feel a certain way. How much permission it gives

111
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,840
me to be a total asshole. The lone survivor type. How the fantasy here presents an uncomfortable

112
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,800
tension between the ways I want to roleplay in this world versus the ways the game requires me

113
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,600
to play to make it through the night. As I stalk the halls of the station, I'm vulnerable. I don't

114
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,960
have many bullets to protect myself with. I have fewer healing items. Zombies are tough. Even on

115
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,160
normal, they take multiple headshots, and they often don't stay down. I have to raid this place

116
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,560
to survive by looking in lockers, desks, in weird corners and dark cabinets. And I'm collecting all

117
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,080
kinds of things. Bullets, sure, but also gunpowder and knick-knacks. Keys. Crappy

118
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,240
boards to slam onto windows and keep out the riff-raff. Yeah, this is Resident Evil. It's

119
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,520
a survival horror game. You scavenge for stuff to stay alive during the zombie apocalypse as you

120
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,080
make your way through the game. It's supposed to be like this. The PlayStation as a fortress or

121
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,760
safe haven is laughably naive, particularly for people of colour. Oh, here we go.

122
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,440
It certainly was in the 90s as well, and really, when has policing in America ever

123
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,840
actually been about keeping neighbourhoods safe, as opposed to keeping the racist status quo up

124
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,920
and running? You fucking had to go here, didn't you? I feel bad looting the place at least at

125
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,840
first since this is the staging area for what we in EMS call a mass casualty incident. So of course,

126
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,480
I went in thinking like an EMT, looking for survivors to help. Like the nice dude who

127
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,960
saves me from a faulty door, who is clearly suffering from some kind of awful wound.

128
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I want to help him. Claire wants to help him too, exclaiming that we need to get him to the

129
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,520
hospital, but he refuses. And the game doesn't give me any tools for mending wounds or even

130
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,600
putting gauze on bandages or something. The only first aid items are hilarious

131
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,640
magical herbs and sprays, though the guns and blood look, well, more or less like the actual

132
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,200
thing. This is a game about dealing and surviving damage, not healing it. And after a while,

133
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,160
I subtly give in to its goofy logic. I have permission to loot and run just mashing the

134
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,040
X button to try and drive by pickup items. There's no one else here, really. It's a world

135
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,440
all for me. And I'm allowed to do anything I goddamn well please. To treat it all like my own

136
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,040
shitty playground. No, I need to treat it this way if I want to progress. And I'm morally allowed to,

137
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,120
because I'm not hurting anyone else, anyone who's alive anyway, because scarcity doesn't affect

138
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,640
anybody else in this world. I cannot believe you are bitching about this. That the game is set up

139
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:48,560
in such a way that you find stuff and use it. I'm limited to and encouraged to engage in a whole

140
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,360
bunch of antisocial behaviors, stealing shit, shooting antagonists in the face, stabbing them.

141
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,760
They're fucking zombies. I think this person just might not be fucking into video games,

142
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,480
or at least video games that aren't walking simulators.

143
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,440
Next article. Child abuse images hidden in cryptocurrency blockchain.

144
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,000
Pedophiles are hiding child porn in the bitcoins. Somebody added the illegal images to the core

145
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,120
ledger of Bitcoin Satoshi vision by using a payment processor. This ledger, known as the

146
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,320
blockchain, is a running record of cryptocurrency transactions shared among users of the platform.

147
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,440
Experts have warned that abuse of blockchain tech is a growing problem. Experts have also warned

148
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,800
that use of blockchain tech frees people from the global financial system, and to them, that's also

149
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,760
a growing problem. Let's be honest though, very clearly embedding child porn in the bitcoins is

150
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,600
not a good thing, but I don't know what they could honestly do about it because Bitcoin is so

151
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,440
decentralized, like good luck stopping that. One key feature of the blockchain is that information

152
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,560
added to it cannot be changed without significant effort. In January, the amount of data that could

153
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,760
be added to the BSV blockchain was increased significantly. Before that, people could generally

154
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,360
only add short chunks of text or web links to the blockchain. But now it's possible to add

155
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,520
full images in an encoded format. I wonder if this is what they'll use to shut down Bitcoin.

156
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,720
They'll just say, oh, we can't change it. We can't edit it. There's child porn in the bitcoins.

157
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,680
Shut it all down. End the entire project. Let's end with this. Karl Marx's London grave

158
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:35,280
vandalized and suspected hammer attack. Oh no. Smash the patriarchy, my friends. Use the hammer

159
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,360
from the hammer and sickle. The tomb of Karl Marx at London's Highgate cemetery has been

160
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,960
vandalized in a targeted attack. That means the grade one listed monument will never be the same

161
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,080
again. Suspected vandal damaged a marble plaque, which was taken from Marx's original 1883

162
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,040
gravestone and incorporated into the 1954 monument. Images of the defaced memorial,

163
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,240
which attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year, shows what appears to be damaged done by a

164
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,360
hammer to the lettering of Marx's name and the marble on which it's mounted. Ian Dungavel,

165
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,840
the chief executive of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, condemned the attack as an

166
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,440
appalling thing to do and a particularly inarticulate form of political comment,

167
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,600
warning that the tomb would be permanently scarred. I assume that was the point,

168
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,880
was to permanently scar it? And let's be honest here, communism is a particularly inarticulate

169
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,480
form of political organization. But to cut right to the heart of the matter,

170
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,000
it's kind of funny, but it shouldn't have been done. In much the same way that you can't be

171
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,280
taking down Confederate monuments or any other artwork or plaques that you disagree with,

172
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,360
that shit shouldn't be happening. Regardless of what anyone thinks about Marx's philosophy,

173
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,520
I just think it's an appalling thing to do. On a human level, this is a grave of his wife,

174
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,160
his own grave, and other members of his family. If it is someone who is rabidly anti-Marxist,

175
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
they could do a lot better trying to change people's opinions rather than just smashing

176
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,400
up the monument. This is not going to win any sympathy to the anti-Marxist cause.

177
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,080
And yeah, that's probably accurate. The children's author and poet, Michael Rosen,

178
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:12,000
suggested launching an appeal for the cost of repair. Cost of repair? I'm sorry, sir,

179
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,360
but you don't understand the labor theory of value. You can't just let the market decide what

180
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,200
is going to be on Karl Marx's tombstone. Alright my friends, that does it for me.

181
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:30,480
I hope you enjoyed the video. Yesterday I did a Q&A session on Twitch. I just grinded out some levels

182
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,160
in Octopath Traveler and answered questions from the chat room. It was pretty fun, so I'd say

183
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,760
there's a 50-50 chance of me doing it again tonight. Drop by twitch.tv slash Game Boomers

184
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,080
if you want to join in. More accurate times will be posted in my Discord. Additionally,

185
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,560
the SFO subscribe star is finally up, for the most part. I've still got to add like

186
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,120
descriptions to the tiers, but it's basically working. That's at subscribestar.com slash

187
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,000
shortfiretaku. As soon as I get my first subscribe star payout, I'm going to take down the Patreon

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,320
link. And don't remember, leave a comment. Inspire me regarding the 50k special, guys.

189
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,280
Thank you very much. Thank you for all the support and all of your viewership, your patronage.

190
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I appreciate all of it. I'm getting out of here. I love you.
