0	5120	Hello and welcome to SJ Weekly. And you know what? This is an absolute fucking disgrace,
5120	11120	you guys, okay? So, my girlfriend had to go to work for 7 a.m. today. I was up before she was
11120	16880	5.30. I make her her favorite breakfast, peanut butter and banana toast. I make her the last
16880	22160	cup of coffee that we have, all right? There's no more coffee. And she doesn't even finish any of
22160	28320	this shit. So, I mean, if you guys want to slurp, this is it. I have to drink cold old coffee today.
30000	42400	Fucking delicious. I want everyone to start shaming Naomi immediately. Those of you who've
42400	48160	been watching for a little while now know that the 50,000 sub mark is coming up soon. If growth
48160	53520	continues, probably sometime this week. So, I'm kind of curious. What do you guys want to see me
53600	61200	do for a 50,000 sub special? I was thinking maybe a Q&A or something. Here's what we'll do. Post
61200	68160	all your ideas for a 50,000 sub special video in the comments of this video. And if there's any
68160	73200	decent ideas, I'll consider them, okay? That's what we'll do. But let's start SJ Weekly with
73200	80640	this tweet from Black Hebrew Israelite. I just walked by Buzzfeed's office and some horrible
80640	85840	monster put these stickers up around the entrance. I hope the FBI investigates this
85840	92800	hate crime and catches the perpetrator ASAP. So, there's Buzzfeed's offices and someone put
92800	107600	learn to code stickers. Oh God, I wonder if they managed to stay there. Anybody who's in the same
107680	112560	city as Buzzfeed's offices, go see if they're there. Alternatively, go plant more. But speaking
112560	119760	of the Black Hebrew Israelites, here's an article from Coed. Complete and utter cuck licks boot of
119760	125360	hate group because he cares about justice. The group is, of course, the Black Israelites. And
125360	131120	look at this guy. The Black Israelites are out there protesting for black rights, for black
131120	138240	supremacy basically. And this white soy boy cuck decides to lick his boot to show how non-racist
138240	144240	he is. I know this is an older article, but nonetheless, Jesus Christ, man. This is next
144240	150400	level cuckery at its finest. A white guilt-ridden beta male passes by a group of Black Hebrew
150400	156880	Israelites and proceeds to lick a boot clean upon request. The beta male claims to care about
156880	162800	justice. And one preaching Israelite put this guy's SJW stats to the test and said,
162800	168000	so if you're really a man of justice, bow down your face to the earth and lick the dust off of
168000	172960	my boot. And you probably know what happened next. The beta male shrugs his shoulders,
172960	176320	asks if that's what they really want him to do, and then gets down on his knees to lick the boot
176320	181040	of the vocal Black Israelites. What the fuck, dude? Wait, there's a video?
206320	214560	What you just saw was a trailer for Black Panther 2, guys.
214560	221040	Let's move on to something a bit more contemporary on The Blaze. After 55,000 people show support,
221040	225440	a new period emoji will soon be released to destigmatize menstruation.
226400	230800	The inclusion of an emoji is a huge step towards normalizing periods. Is that really all it takes
230880	238320	nowadays? If you want a certain event or a social issue or whatever to be destigmatized
238320	243440	and normalized, you just make an emoji about it. Is that really all it takes at this point?
243440	249680	Let me just point something out. If you live with a girlfriend or a wife ever at any point
249680	255920	in your life, periods will stop being a mystery to you. They don't need to be destigmatized
255920	261440	or normalized at that point. So it sounds like if there's any actual serious problem
262240	268080	with the normalization of periods, it's probably among a generation or a crowd of people who
268960	274480	can't have a committed relationship. Also, Jesus Christ, the red drop emoji is fine.
274480	282880	You don't need the fucking period pad. Let's have an emoji for just shit-stained underwear.
282880	287520	Let's destigmatize and normalize shitting your pants. That sounds good.
287520	293520	Children's rights charity Plan International UK launched the campaign for a period emoji after
293520	299760	conducting a 2017 survey and discovered just how much shame and stigma still impact girls
299760	303600	and women's experience of having their period. That sucks and that sounds like something they
303600	308320	got to get over, but I don't think an emoji will help with that. There's a reason why
308960	316160	the eggplant and the peach emojis are used for genitalia or sexual purposes, and it's because
316160	322640	you shouldn't have blatantly sexual things as universal emoji. The winning image was dubbed
322640	327520	period pants. Plan International UK submitted to the emoji powers that be at Unicode,
327520	334480	but sadly the design didn't get accepted. Good. Undeterred, Plan International UK partnered with
334480	339040	NHS Blood and Transplant and submitted its second place design, the blood droplet,
339040	343360	which was accepted. And that's fine because you know what? The blood droplet can be used
343360	350480	for multiple things. Human beings do occasionally bleed from places other than their vagina.
350480	356080	They might spin it as a period emoji, and I'm sure there's going to be some girls out there
356080	362480	who use it as a period emoji. That's definitely fine, of course. However, a red drop of liquid
362480	368720	is honestly fine. You could also have a green one if you want. I think there's probably already
368720	374880	a blue one for water. This is just a non-story. What the fuck? I can't believe I'm actually
374880	378640	talking about this nonsense. However, some people are really fucking excited about it.
378640	384240	We're getting a period emoji and it's bloody brilliant news. They say that an emoji won't
384240	388720	necessarily solve the issues surrounding period stigma and silence, but it will help change the
388720	394720	conversation and end the shame around periods. I don't know. I don't know about that, man. Like,
395680	401360	very clearly, nobody should be shamed for basic biological functions. I think we can all agree
401360	407680	on that. That makes sense, right? If your body is doing stuff that you can't control, should you be
407680	415520	shamed about it? No. Should you still have a responsibility to perform adequate maintenance
415520	420960	on your body even though it's doing things that are out of your control? Yes. That's why free
420960	426160	bleeding, for example, is so stupid. And that's why it's hilarious that a whole bunch of dumb
426160	432800	feminists fell for it when 4chan basically made it up. Men, it is completely reasonable to treat
432800	439280	period blood like it's any other type of waste product that comes out of the human body and
439280	444560	therefore is disgusting because that's exactly what it is. I mean, you probably shouldn't be
444560	450240	shamed for taking a shit, but that's no reason to celebrate taking a shit, is it? And hey,
450240	455600	that does put the period emoji in line with the poop emoji, so there you go. Good company.
455600	461280	However, while emojis can be used to empower some people, they're also meant to be used to
461280	463040	oppress others. For example...
463040	475040	Finally, a new emoji to mock men. The latest batch of emojis features new possibilities
475040	481280	for shattering fragile masculinities and capitalism alike. We're going to be using
481840	487520	emojis to own capitalism now, epic style. Is that it? Is that what we're doing? Also,
487600	494800	I'm pretty sure that there are more than one way to use this emoji. It's not all about
494800	497840	penis size, though I'm sure that's all Vice cares about.
497840	502560	Great news! We're finally getting an emoji that's perfect for easily humiliating men
502560	508240	when they're being disgusting online. Or, you know, being men. The small dick emoji.
508240	512720	Officially named Pinching Hand, the emoji has been approved by the Unicode Consortium
512720	517360	for release across major platforms this year. It's also great for illustrating capitalism's
518240	521920	failures by capturing the inadequate minimum wage or your lackluster salary.
521920	530160	The possibilities are endless. Countless men who aren't secure in their masculinity will
530160	535040	be affected by the new option, we know, but it was high time to replace the purple eggplant,
535600	540560	which, as a 2015 study confirmed, everyone obviously uses a dick for something more
540560	546320	realistic. Emojipedia catalogued the new emojis. The batch includes a wheelchair,
546320	551840	a gender inclusive couple, two service dogs, a yawning face, a flamingo, an orangutan,
551840	557120	a hang glider, butter, garlic, and more. I thought a lot of those were already emojis.
557120	562800	Is this an old article? Hold on a minute. No. February 6th, 2019.
562800	567760	You know what I want? I want inclusivity and equality here. I want to see a new emoji
567760	574400	to mock women. And you know what it's going to be? Just two hands making a giant circle
574480	580640	to show how gigantically wide and overused the vaginas of the women at Vice actually are.
581600	586720	And I guarantee you, once we get that emoji, there's going to be a bunch of angry women
586720	591760	online complaining that it is sexist. Speaking of female empowerment, I wish
591760	596320	Resident Evil 2 let me be a more compassionate hero. This is a game I pretty much passed on.
597040	601440	One of my new year's resolutions was to only play video games if I'm streaming them
601920	606880	on Twitch TV. And that was just one way to get me to at least be making some type of content
606880	612880	if I'm gaming, so it's not like a complete waste of time. And right now I'm just playing too many
612880	617920	games on Twitch at the moment. Hollow Knight, Kingdom Hearts, Octopath Traveler. There just
617920	624160	wasn't really room for Resident Evil 2 beyond the 30 minute demo that came out a few weeks back.
624160	629920	I'm playing Resident Evil 2 for the first time. Well, mostly. Back in 1998, my 14 year old self
629920	634160	scoured the pages of a Tips and Tricks magazine walkthrough of the game, covering every gameplay
634160	639360	beat and plot point. And I played a few minutes of it on a friend's PS1. So I'm familiar with
639360	642880	the scenery and the structure, the quests and the characters, but this is the first time I'm
642880	649520	experiencing it. It's scary and tense, and very much a period piece, a late 90s survival horror
649520	655520	game set squarely in the later Clinton era with dollar gallons of gas and chunky computers,
656480	662400	now boasting some modern design niceties. Playing on normal, I can save as many times as I'd like,
662400	666640	and the cutscenes and visuals are pretty adept Resident Evil 7 standards. But one thing that's
666640	671760	sticking out to me, still early on in the police station, is how perfectly the game uses scarcity
671760	676480	and this fantasy of hyper competence to make me feel a certain way. How much permission it gives
676480	681840	me to be a total asshole. The lone survivor type. How the fantasy here presents an uncomfortable
681840	686800	tension between the ways I want to roleplay in this world versus the ways the game requires me
686800	691600	to play to make it through the night. As I stalk the halls of the station, I'm vulnerable. I don't
691600	696960	have many bullets to protect myself with. I have fewer healing items. Zombies are tough. Even on
696960	702160	normal, they take multiple headshots, and they often don't stay down. I have to raid this place
702160	708560	to survive by looking in lockers, desks, in weird corners and dark cabinets. And I'm collecting all
708560	714080	kinds of things. Bullets, sure, but also gunpowder and knick-knacks. Keys. Crappy
714080	718240	boards to slam onto windows and keep out the riff-raff. Yeah, this is Resident Evil. It's
718240	723520	a survival horror game. You scavenge for stuff to stay alive during the zombie apocalypse as you
723520	728080	make your way through the game. It's supposed to be like this. The PlayStation as a fortress or
728080	733760	safe haven is laughably naive, particularly for people of colour. Oh, here we go.
734080	739440	It certainly was in the 90s as well, and really, when has policing in America ever
739440	743840	actually been about keeping neighbourhoods safe, as opposed to keeping the racist status quo up
743840	749920	and running? You fucking had to go here, didn't you? I feel bad looting the place at least at
749920	755840	first since this is the staging area for what we in EMS call a mass casualty incident. So of course,
755840	760480	I went in thinking like an EMT, looking for survivors to help. Like the nice dude who
760560	764960	saves me from a faulty door, who is clearly suffering from some kind of awful wound.
764960	768960	I want to help him. Claire wants to help him too, exclaiming that we need to get him to the
768960	773520	hospital, but he refuses. And the game doesn't give me any tools for mending wounds or even
773520	777600	putting gauze on bandages or something. The only first aid items are hilarious
777600	782640	magical herbs and sprays, though the guns and blood look, well, more or less like the actual
782640	789200	thing. This is a game about dealing and surviving damage, not healing it. And after a while,
789200	794160	I subtly give in to its goofy logic. I have permission to loot and run just mashing the
794160	799040	X button to try and drive by pickup items. There's no one else here, really. It's a world
799040	803440	all for me. And I'm allowed to do anything I goddamn well please. To treat it all like my own
803440	809040	shitty playground. No, I need to treat it this way if I want to progress. And I'm morally allowed to,
809040	813120	because I'm not hurting anyone else, anyone who's alive anyway, because scarcity doesn't affect
813120	820640	anybody else in this world. I cannot believe you are bitching about this. That the game is set up
820640	828560	in such a way that you find stuff and use it. I'm limited to and encouraged to engage in a whole
828560	835360	bunch of antisocial behaviors, stealing shit, shooting antagonists in the face, stabbing them.
835360	841760	They're fucking zombies. I think this person just might not be fucking into video games,
841760	844480	or at least video games that aren't walking simulators.
844480	849440	Next article. Child abuse images hidden in cryptocurrency blockchain.
850400	856000	Pedophiles are hiding child porn in the bitcoins. Somebody added the illegal images to the core
856000	861120	ledger of Bitcoin Satoshi vision by using a payment processor. This ledger, known as the
861120	866320	blockchain, is a running record of cryptocurrency transactions shared among users of the platform.
866320	871440	Experts have warned that abuse of blockchain tech is a growing problem. Experts have also warned
871440	876800	that use of blockchain tech frees people from the global financial system, and to them, that's also
876800	881760	a growing problem. Let's be honest though, very clearly embedding child porn in the bitcoins is
881760	887600	not a good thing, but I don't know what they could honestly do about it because Bitcoin is so
887600	893440	decentralized, like good luck stopping that. One key feature of the blockchain is that information
893440	898560	added to it cannot be changed without significant effort. In January, the amount of data that could
898560	903760	be added to the BSV blockchain was increased significantly. Before that, people could generally
903760	909360	only add short chunks of text or web links to the blockchain. But now it's possible to add
909360	913520	full images in an encoded format. I wonder if this is what they'll use to shut down Bitcoin.
914560	918720	They'll just say, oh, we can't change it. We can't edit it. There's child porn in the bitcoins.
918720	925680	Shut it all down. End the entire project. Let's end with this. Karl Marx's London grave
925680	935280	vandalized and suspected hammer attack. Oh no. Smash the patriarchy, my friends. Use the hammer
935280	941360	from the hammer and sickle. The tomb of Karl Marx at London's Highgate cemetery has been
941360	946960	vandalized in a targeted attack. That means the grade one listed monument will never be the same
946960	952080	again. Suspected vandal damaged a marble plaque, which was taken from Marx's original 1883
952080	957040	gravestone and incorporated into the 1954 monument. Images of the defaced memorial,
957040	962240	which attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year, shows what appears to be damaged done by a
962240	967360	hammer to the lettering of Marx's name and the marble on which it's mounted. Ian Dungavel,
967360	971840	the chief executive of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, condemned the attack as an
971840	975440	appalling thing to do and a particularly inarticulate form of political comment,
976320	979600	warning that the tomb would be permanently scarred. I assume that was the point,
979600	984880	was to permanently scar it? And let's be honest here, communism is a particularly inarticulate
984880	988480	form of political organization. But to cut right to the heart of the matter,
989680	994000	it's kind of funny, but it shouldn't have been done. In much the same way that you can't be
994000	999280	taking down Confederate monuments or any other artwork or plaques that you disagree with,
999280	1003360	that shit shouldn't be happening. Regardless of what anyone thinks about Marx's philosophy,
1003360	1007520	I just think it's an appalling thing to do. On a human level, this is a grave of his wife,
1007520	1012160	his own grave, and other members of his family. If it is someone who is rabidly anti-Marxist,
1012160	1016240	they could do a lot better trying to change people's opinions rather than just smashing
1016240	1020400	up the monument. This is not going to win any sympathy to the anti-Marxist cause.
1021120	1026080	And yeah, that's probably accurate. The children's author and poet, Michael Rosen,
1026080	1032000	suggested launching an appeal for the cost of repair. Cost of repair? I'm sorry, sir,
1032000	1037360	but you don't understand the labor theory of value. You can't just let the market decide what
1038240	1043200	is going to be on Karl Marx's tombstone. Alright my friends, that does it for me.
1043200	1050480	I hope you enjoyed the video. Yesterday I did a Q&A session on Twitch. I just grinded out some levels
1050480	1054160	in Octopath Traveler and answered questions from the chat room. It was pretty fun, so I'd say
1054160	1059760	there's a 50-50 chance of me doing it again tonight. Drop by twitch.tv slash Game Boomers
1059760	1064080	if you want to join in. More accurate times will be posted in my Discord. Additionally,
1064160	1068560	the SFO subscribe star is finally up, for the most part. I've still got to add like
1068560	1073120	descriptions to the tiers, but it's basically working. That's at subscribestar.com slash
1073120	1078000	shortfiretaku. As soon as I get my first subscribe star payout, I'm going to take down the Patreon
1078000	1084320	link. And don't remember, leave a comment. Inspire me regarding the 50k special, guys.
1084320	1089280	Thank you very much. Thank you for all the support and all of your viewership, your patronage.
1089280	1093280	I appreciate all of it. I'm getting out of here. I love you.
