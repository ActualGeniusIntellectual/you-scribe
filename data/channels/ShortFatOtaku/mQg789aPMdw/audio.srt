00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
So, in case you haven't been watching The Simpsons, and really, who still does,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,400
this clip from a recent episode went viral.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
She's not a big presence in my life.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Your love life makes us heave.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You two will never see Tel Aviv.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your grief's in your palm with emoluments.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's okay with God, says Mike Pence.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're Boris Johnson without the class.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Can't wait to see you behind prison glass.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Your nose is right up Putin's ass.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We say it's time to impeach you fast.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh no, it's the Democratic candidates.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Can't be the first one to lose my breath.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can't be the first one to fall.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who's an old man now?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, I'll say goodbye to the ad revenue on this video already.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Donate on Subscribestar, pals.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But this does seem to be a new low for The Simpsons,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
which has already been a shambling corpse of a show for the last decade or two.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To be clear, I'm not complaining with the goofy Trump caricature.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I didn't complain when Family Guy did Clinton, Bush, or Obama.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's exactly what political comedy should be.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The problem is that, in The Simpsons clip, it's just not funny.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
To contrast, Clinton has sex with Lois.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mr. President, I need to have a word with you.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, you certainly are very persuasive.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I've been told. Hey, you wanna give me that cigar? I'm ready to smoke it now.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Obama's a smooth-talking, literal star.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Bush acts like a bumbling monkey.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Uh, Mr. President, are you up there?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go away!

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sir, there's a disaster in New Orleans.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm reading super fudge.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You gotta come down and deal with this.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't make me do stuff.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The point of parody is to magnify the negative traits of the real person to the point of absurdity.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
With the exception of Trump's tiny hands, nothing in this clip is parody.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Trump's a man of many faults, but he's not known for running away from four empowered whammans who sing in unison at him.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is like watching a video of what the radical left desperately wants Trump to be, not an overblown version of what he actually is.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And speaking of those four whammans, the Squad's got many negative traits as well, as do all the Democratic candidates.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They're just as ripe for parody as Trump is, and a good political parody that includes people from multiple parties will take shots at all of them.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm reminded of the 2004 presidential election cartoon that JibJab did, where they clearly left their own politics at the door and made everyone look like a goof for the sake of comedy.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, I wish our winning were a bit more certain.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Better call my friends at Halliburton.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We will pay!

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So we stay!

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Rule the day.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
D.C. land.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sensitive, I cannot lie.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'd love to hug and kiss this guy.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are they gay?

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We won't say.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
On our way.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
D.C. land.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But we don't have that with The Simpsons.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's just orange man bad and Democrats good.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Maybe it's because The Simpsons has been in Dead Show since what, season 12? Season 10?

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
According to DeadHomerSociety.com, The Simpsons has been colloquially known as Zombie Simpsons since 1999, because it's obvious that nobody involved with the show cares anymore, and nobody's actually left watching.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The Simpsons is kept around nowadays because it's a cultural staple, not because it's any good.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Kinda like Star Trek Voyager was.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And, back in the good seasons of The Simpsons, you would have never seen this Trump clip happen.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, you'd see political parody, sure.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But here's how old Simpsons did it.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Part of the charm of old Simpsons is that celebrity guests wouldn't actually play themselves.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They'd do caricatures of themselves, caricatures of others.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hell, they'd sometimes do random normal characters.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The fun was in recognizing their voice.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It was kind of a meta-joke, realizing that a singer you were a fan of, or that actor you liked, was playing somebody ridiculous and not at all within their usual wheelhouse.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But now, the joke is that the celebrities play themselves, showing up in Springfield for no reason other than just to be there.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, let's directly compare.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Here's how old Simpsons would have handled the Trump situation.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ugh, that Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity. Can you believe that?

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, switch the station.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, no, no, no, guys.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not very political.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I usually think people who vote are a bit fruity.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But for some reason, this Burt's Barlow really speaks to me.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He speaks to me.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Good morning, fellow freedom-likers. Burt's Barlow, the fourth branch of government, the 51st state.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
See, in this case, we didn't need to be told that Homer was listening to Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In fact, if he actually was listening to one of those guys, this clip wouldn't be funny at all.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This speaks to a larger point about The Simpsons.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Homer was always a parody of the sitcom Dad, and the comedy comes from the fact that he is a parody.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Everything goes for every other character on The Simpsons, from the other family members, to the kids at school, to the people around town.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They're all stylized, hyper-exaggerated variants of real people.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's what makes them a parody, which is why it was absolutely stupid, by the way, that the creators bowed to social justice outrage and removed Apu from the show a little while ago,

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
because he was a parody of an Indian immigrant, something they found offensive, which was not only the point of his character, but the point of the entire show.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I hate Apu.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I hate Apu.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And because of that, I dislike The Simpsons.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The whole series.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I love The Simpsons because you hate yourself.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Except that's not the point of The Simpsons anymore.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Not in the zombie years.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Bart's not a parody of a skateboarding, video game loving kid.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He's just a kid now.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Homer's not a parody of a bumbling dad.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's just a dad.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mr. Burns isn't a parody of the Monopoly man, Bent Evil.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's just an evil capitalist.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The Simpsons shifted from being the parody that everyone loved, to being the bland, milquetoast media that is now parodied by greater shows.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's no surprise that Family Guy came to prominence alongside the decline of The Simpsons, because old Family Guy was willing to be a parody again when The Simpsons wasn't.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And it's also no surprise that as Family Guy's creators talk about not being able to do edgy jokes anymore, that that show is also on the decline.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In a broader sense, the culture of the late 80s all the way up to the early 2000s was a crash course in shock value.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
From lesbian titty flicks and gory action movies, early internet shitposting in the creation of 4chan, Mortal Kombat and Duke Nukem, Jackass and Punk'd and MXC.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Everything that was popular revolved around getting a rise out of people.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Not a reaction, I'm not talking about the fine bros garbage where everything's faked and people pose with their mouths open as wide as they can for a thumbnail.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean a rise.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Doing wild things for laughs.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Watching wild things to scare yourself or gross yourself out.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Pushing boundaries.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Enjoying extreme sports for the sick moves and the bone-crunching failures.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
For all the drawbacks of punk subculture, it was at least willing to have an edge.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Horror movies were celebrated for their gore, not censored for it.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Violent games were awesome, not problematic.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sexual content was cool, not oppressive.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Raunchy comedies were hilarious, not gross.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you really think a show or a movie like Jackass would fly today?

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Or is that just too violent or disgusting for 2019's audience?

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you think Punk'd would fly today?

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Or is being the butt of a hidden camera joke just too traumatizing for the zoomers out there?

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Old Simpsons thrived throughout it all.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It was one of the go-tos alongside South Park for parody.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It was the show where the viewer could laugh at the powerful or poke fun at society around them.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But when those disaffected 20 and 30-somethings of the 90's became the current power structure, they stopped critiquing it.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They lost their edge and all of their old works were either cancelled or neutered into oblivion.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In my video on the downvote button, I talked about how Egoraptor went from being an edgy content creator to a total cuck.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's kind of like that.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In fact, I think Egoraptor rode the exact same cultural wave that The Simpsons did,

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
although obviously in a completely different capacity.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He exists in the same class of people as the creators of The Simpsons.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
When they were young and brash, still in the exploratory phase of their lives,

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
all of these dudes were edgy little shits that liked shock humor, cultural critique, prank culture, sex, and violence.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Racism was funny, not because they were racist, but because their old fuddy-duddy parents would gasp in startled disapproval at a racist joke.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But now they're the old parents.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now that they've made their fortunes and earned their place in the zeitgeist using shock humor,

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
they themselves gasp at the next generation doing what they once did 10 or 20 years ago.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can honestly hear Egoraptor's thoughts in my head when he sees a YouTuber make a racist joke.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How did he get away with that? That's problematic. That hurts people's feelings.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He shouldn't get famous doing that.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Even though that's what he did when he was that age.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's fallen out of that exploratory mindset, and he just doesn't understand that the next generation is reaching the height of it.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I know, Egoraptor's not The Simpsons, obviously.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But this logic applies to every single person, every single group, every organization, show, movie, series, whatever,

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that did a complete tonal 180 as they stopped seeing the world with a sense of wonder.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The sexually liberated woman becomes the sex-negative SJW.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The shock humor comedian begins to language police everything around him.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The peddler of violent games and movies starts telling us to think of the children.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And The Simpsons stops parodying politicians and simply draws them hoping we'll laugh.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But nobody's laughing.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And it's not because we're all Trump supporters and we just hate the joke or something.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, it's more fundamental than that.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's because zombie Simpsons is a symptom of a larger problem.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Millennials, and to a slightly lesser extent Gen Xers, are people so self-centered,

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
they have yet to realize that just because they're now in their 30s and 40s,

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and they're growing out of the stuff they used to like,

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that stuff does not need to be banned or butchered in order to serve their new sensibilities.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's okay to not like the things that you used to like.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That doesn't make those things retroactively immoral or something.

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's also okay for other people to like things you don't like too.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That doesn't make them immoral people either.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is why you got ratioed on Twitter when you posted this absolute garbage.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Because everyone knows what you're doing.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is the midlife crisis of The Simpsons.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Desperately at trying to appear young and cool.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And everybody just shat on them for it.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'd rather go check out some of that awful Russian-made Simpsons porn of Bart fucking Marge or something.
