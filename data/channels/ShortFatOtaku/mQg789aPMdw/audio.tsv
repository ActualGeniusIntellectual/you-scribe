0	4160	So, in case you haven't been watching The Simpsons, and really, who still does,
4160	6400	this clip from a recent episode went viral.
31000	34000	She's not a big presence in my life.
34000	36000	Your love life makes us heave.
36000	39000	You two will never see Tel Aviv.
40000	43000	Your grief's in your palm with emoluments.
43000	46000	It's okay with God, says Mike Pence.
46000	48000	You're Boris Johnson without the class.
48000	51000	Can't wait to see you behind prison glass.
51000	53000	Your nose is right up Putin's ass.
53000	56000	We say it's time to impeach you fast.
60000	62000	Oh no, it's the Democratic candidates.
67000	69000	Can't be the first one to lose my breath.
69000	72000	Can't be the first one to fall.
73000	75000	Who's an old man now?
79000	83000	Yeah, I'll say goodbye to the ad revenue on this video already.
83000	85000	Donate on Subscribestar, pals.
85000	87000	But this does seem to be a new low for The Simpsons,
87000	91000	which has already been a shambling corpse of a show for the last decade or two.
91000	94000	To be clear, I'm not complaining with the goofy Trump caricature.
94000	98000	I didn't complain when Family Guy did Clinton, Bush, or Obama.
98000	100000	That's exactly what political comedy should be.
100000	104000	The problem is that, in The Simpsons clip, it's just not funny.
104000	106000	To contrast, Clinton has sex with Lois.
106000	109000	Mr. President, I need to have a word with you.
109000	113000	Well, you certainly are very persuasive.
113000	117000	So I've been told. Hey, you wanna give me that cigar? I'm ready to smoke it now.
117000	120000	Obama's a smooth-talking, literal star.
128000	130000	Bush acts like a bumbling monkey.
130000	132000	Uh, Mr. President, are you up there?
132000	133000	Go away!
133000	135000	Sir, there's a disaster in New Orleans.
135000	136000	I'm reading super fudge.
136000	137000	You gotta come down and deal with this.
137000	138000	Don't make me do stuff.
138000	143000	The point of parody is to magnify the negative traits of the real person to the point of absurdity.
143000	147000	With the exception of Trump's tiny hands, nothing in this clip is parody.
147000	154000	Trump's a man of many faults, but he's not known for running away from four empowered whammans who sing in unison at him.
154000	161000	This is like watching a video of what the radical left desperately wants Trump to be, not an overblown version of what he actually is.
161000	167000	And speaking of those four whammans, the Squad's got many negative traits as well, as do all the Democratic candidates.
167000	173000	They're just as ripe for parody as Trump is, and a good political parody that includes people from multiple parties will take shots at all of them.
173000	182000	I'm reminded of the 2004 presidential election cartoon that JibJab did, where they clearly left their own politics at the door and made everyone look like a goof for the sake of comedy.
182000	185000	Oh, I wish our winning were a bit more certain.
185000	187000	Better call my friends at Halliburton.
187000	188000	We will pay!
188000	189000	So we stay!
189000	190000	Rule the day.
190000	191000	D.C. land.
191000	194000	I'm sensitive, I cannot lie.
194000	196000	I'd love to hug and kiss this guy.
196000	197000	Are they gay?
197000	198000	We won't say.
198000	199000	On our way.
199000	200000	D.C. land.
200000	202000	But we don't have that with The Simpsons.
202000	205000	It's just orange man bad and Democrats good.
205000	210000	Maybe it's because The Simpsons has been in Dead Show since what, season 12? Season 10?
210000	222000	According to DeadHomerSociety.com, The Simpsons has been colloquially known as Zombie Simpsons since 1999, because it's obvious that nobody involved with the show cares anymore, and nobody's actually left watching.
222000	225000	The Simpsons is kept around nowadays because it's a cultural staple, not because it's any good.
225000	227000	Kinda like Star Trek Voyager was.
227000	232000	And, back in the good seasons of The Simpsons, you would have never seen this Trump clip happen.
232000	234000	Oh, you'd see political parody, sure.
234000	236000	But here's how old Simpsons did it.
256000	261000	Part of the charm of old Simpsons is that celebrity guests wouldn't actually play themselves.
261000	264000	They'd do caricatures of themselves, caricatures of others.
264000	267000	Hell, they'd sometimes do random normal characters.
267000	269000	The fun was in recognizing their voice.
269000	278000	It was kind of a meta-joke, realizing that a singer you were a fan of, or that actor you liked, was playing somebody ridiculous and not at all within their usual wheelhouse.
279000	285000	But now, the joke is that the celebrities play themselves, showing up in Springfield for no reason other than just to be there.
294000	295000	Okay, let's directly compare.
295000	298000	Here's how old Simpsons would have handled the Trump situation.
309000	312000	Ugh, that Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.
312000	315000	He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity. Can you believe that?
315000	316000	Yeah, switch the station.
316000	321000	I consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable.
321000	322000	No, no, no, no, guys.
322000	324000	I'm not very political.
324000	327000	I usually think people who vote are a bit fruity.
327000	330000	But for some reason, this Burt's Barlow really speaks to me.
330000	331000	He speaks to me.
337000	341000	Good morning, fellow freedom-likers. Burt's Barlow, the fourth branch of government, the 51st state.
341000	346000	See, in this case, we didn't need to be told that Homer was listening to Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones.
346000	351000	In fact, if he actually was listening to one of those guys, this clip wouldn't be funny at all.
351000	353000	This speaks to a larger point about The Simpsons.
353000	358000	Homer was always a parody of the sitcom Dad, and the comedy comes from the fact that he is a parody.
358000	363000	Everything goes for every other character on The Simpsons, from the other family members, to the kids at school, to the people around town.
363000	367000	They're all stylized, hyper-exaggerated variants of real people.
367000	375000	That's what makes them a parody, which is why it was absolutely stupid, by the way, that the creators bowed to social justice outrage and removed Apu from the show a little while ago,
375000	382000	because he was a parody of an Indian immigrant, something they found offensive, which was not only the point of his character, but the point of the entire show.
382000	383000	I hate Apu.
383000	384000	I hate Apu.
384000	385000	And because of that, I dislike The Simpsons.
385000	386000	The whole series.
386000	390000	I love The Simpsons because you hate yourself.
390000	392000	Except that's not the point of The Simpsons anymore.
392000	393000	Not in the zombie years.
393000	397000	Bart's not a parody of a skateboarding, video game loving kid.
397000	398000	He's just a kid now.
398000	400000	Homer's not a parody of a bumbling dad.
400000	401000	He's just a dad.
401000	404000	Mr. Burns isn't a parody of the Monopoly man, Bent Evil.
404000	406000	He's just an evil capitalist.
406000	413000	The Simpsons shifted from being the parody that everyone loved, to being the bland, milquetoast media that is now parodied by greater shows.
413000	421000	It's no surprise that Family Guy came to prominence alongside the decline of The Simpsons, because old Family Guy was willing to be a parody again when The Simpsons wasn't.
421000	428000	And it's also no surprise that as Family Guy's creators talk about not being able to do edgy jokes anymore, that that show is also on the decline.
428000	434000	In a broader sense, the culture of the late 80s all the way up to the early 2000s was a crash course in shock value.
435000	444000	From lesbian titty flicks and gory action movies, early internet shitposting in the creation of 4chan, Mortal Kombat and Duke Nukem, Jackass and Punk'd and MXC.
444000	447000	Everything that was popular revolved around getting a rise out of people.
447000	454000	Not a reaction, I'm not talking about the fine bros garbage where everything's faked and people pose with their mouths open as wide as they can for a thumbnail.
454000	455000	I mean a rise.
455000	457000	Doing wild things for laughs.
457000	460000	Watching wild things to scare yourself or gross yourself out.
460000	461000	Pushing boundaries.
461000	465000	Enjoying extreme sports for the sick moves and the bone-crunching failures.
465000	470000	For all the drawbacks of punk subculture, it was at least willing to have an edge.
470000	473000	Horror movies were celebrated for their gore, not censored for it.
473000	475000	Violent games were awesome, not problematic.
475000	478000	Sexual content was cool, not oppressive.
478000	481000	Raunchy comedies were hilarious, not gross.
481000	484000	Do you really think a show or a movie like Jackass would fly today?
484000	488000	Or is that just too violent or disgusting for 2019's audience?
488000	490000	Do you think Punk'd would fly today?
490000	494000	Or is being the butt of a hidden camera joke just too traumatizing for the zoomers out there?
494000	496000	Old Simpsons thrived throughout it all.
496000	499000	It was one of the go-tos alongside South Park for parody.
499000	504000	It was the show where the viewer could laugh at the powerful or poke fun at society around them.
504000	510000	But when those disaffected 20 and 30-somethings of the 90's became the current power structure, they stopped critiquing it.
510000	515000	They lost their edge and all of their old works were either cancelled or neutered into oblivion.
515000	521000	In my video on the downvote button, I talked about how Egoraptor went from being an edgy content creator to a total cuck.
521000	522000	It's kind of like that.
522000	526000	In fact, I think Egoraptor rode the exact same cultural wave that The Simpsons did,
526000	529000	although obviously in a completely different capacity.
529000	533000	He exists in the same class of people as the creators of The Simpsons.
533000	537000	When they were young and brash, still in the exploratory phase of their lives,
537000	544000	all of these dudes were edgy little shits that liked shock humor, cultural critique, prank culture, sex, and violence.
544000	551000	Racism was funny, not because they were racist, but because their old fuddy-duddy parents would gasp in startled disapproval at a racist joke.
551000	553000	But now they're the old parents.
553000	558000	Now that they've made their fortunes and earned their place in the zeitgeist using shock humor,
558000	563000	they themselves gasp at the next generation doing what they once did 10 or 20 years ago.
563000	568000	I can honestly hear Egoraptor's thoughts in my head when he sees a YouTuber make a racist joke.
568000	572000	How did he get away with that? That's problematic. That hurts people's feelings.
572000	573000	He shouldn't get famous doing that.
573000	576000	Even though that's what he did when he was that age.
576000	582000	He's fallen out of that exploratory mindset, and he just doesn't understand that the next generation is reaching the height of it.
582000	585000	I know, Egoraptor's not The Simpsons, obviously.
585000	592000	But this logic applies to every single person, every single group, every organization, show, movie, series, whatever,
592000	598000	that did a complete tonal 180 as they stopped seeing the world with a sense of wonder.
598000	601000	The sexually liberated woman becomes the sex-negative SJW.
601000	605000	The shock humor comedian begins to language police everything around him.
605000	609000	The peddler of violent games and movies starts telling us to think of the children.
609000	614000	And The Simpsons stops parodying politicians and simply draws them hoping we'll laugh.
614000	616000	But nobody's laughing.
616000	619000	And it's not because we're all Trump supporters and we just hate the joke or something.
619000	621000	No, it's more fundamental than that.
621000	624000	It's because zombie Simpsons is a symptom of a larger problem.
624000	629000	Millennials, and to a slightly lesser extent Gen Xers, are people so self-centered,
629000	633000	they have yet to realize that just because they're now in their 30s and 40s,
633000	635000	and they're growing out of the stuff they used to like,
635000	640000	that stuff does not need to be banned or butchered in order to serve their new sensibilities.
640000	642000	It's okay to not like the things that you used to like.
642000	645000	That doesn't make those things retroactively immoral or something.
645000	648000	It's also okay for other people to like things you don't like too.
648000	650000	That doesn't make them immoral people either.
650000	653000	This is why you got ratioed on Twitter when you posted this absolute garbage.
653000	655000	Because everyone knows what you're doing.
655000	657000	This is the midlife crisis of The Simpsons.
657000	659000	Desperately at trying to appear young and cool.
659000	661000	And everybody just shat on them for it.
661000	667000	I'd rather go check out some of that awful Russian-made Simpsons porn of Bart fucking Marge or something.
