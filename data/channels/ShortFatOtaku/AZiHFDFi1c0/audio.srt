1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
So, China's social credit system has been making the rounds for the past few weeks on

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,320
social media.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,680
The basic idea is that, in the near future, each of China's citizens will be ranked

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,220
by social credit.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,040
People will be punished or rewarded based on their scores, and like financial credit

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
scores, will move up or down depending on their behavior.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,300
Examples of bad behavior that would lower a person's score given by the Chinese government

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,360
includes bad driving, smoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games, and posting

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,920
fake news online.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,440
Here's an incomplete list of things that can happen to you if you happen to have a

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,960
low enough credit score.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,660
You can be banned from flying or traveling by train.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,440
Your internet speeds can be throttled.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,060
You or your kids can be banned from attending the best schools, working the best jobs, or

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,540
staying at the best hotels.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,560
You will have your pets removed from you.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,560
And the government will also have the option of publicly shaming you.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,520
A prototype list already exists that the government is running tests with.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,860
And most recently, Beijing has decided to go forward with full scale implementation

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,280
on all of the city's 22 million inhabitants by 2020.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,740
Those with better so-called social credit will get green channel benefits, while those

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,420
who violate laws will find life more difficult.

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,000
The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,260
will be unable to move even a single step, according to the government's plan.

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,940
If this sounds like a massive overreach of government power, as well as the violation

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,100
of the individual's right to a private life, hey, you'd be right.

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,100
But it's China.

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,140
It's not the West.

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,140
It's not the US.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,140
It's not Canada.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
It's not Europe.

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,580
We don't have anything to worry about, right?

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,540
Laura Loomer was just drummed off the internet, like Gavin McInnes and the Proud Boys, like

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,340
Alex Jones, like the Daily Stormer before her.

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,200
And Laura Loomer's actually pretty innocuous compared to those other examples.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,800
She's an air-headed loon that's too attached to her tires.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
But she's harmless.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,240
However, she's also a high-profile conservative.

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,400
And with the radicals already purged away, people like her are the next to go.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,820
Under a totalitarian form of government, like a fascist or communist state, nearly everything

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,200
is run top-down.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,540
The government creates a plan encompassing the whole of society, and then attempts to

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,820
implement that plan.

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,460
However, in free societies, things are much more likely to be run bottom-up.

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,220
Individuals each build small sections of society piecemeal, according to their own inclinations,

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,700
ability and resources.

47
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,460
This is the fundamental difference between a controlled economy and the free market.

48
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,660
But it applies to more than economics.

49
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,220
Communist China has no problem with a top-down solution like a social credit score.

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,300
And it's pretty clear with the naming and shaming tactics that we see from the progressive

51
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,100
left nowadays that the Chinese solution is basically their wet dream.

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,780
But the citizens of free countries generally don't like the idea of the government becoming

53
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,260
the arbiter of not only the law, but of cultural morality.

54
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,060
And the more that a free country inches towards becoming that arbiter of cultural morality

55
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,740
– like, say, the UK with its hate speech laws – the less free and more centrally

56
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,440
planned that country becomes.

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,820
In the absence of a unified, government-enforced social credit system in the West, the progressives

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,480
within private businesses have taken it upon themselves to piecemeal construct such a system

59
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,620
– a top-down solution implemented in a bottom-up manner.

60
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,660
With YouTube banning problematic streams mid-broadcast, Twitter considering removing likes and follower

61
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,500
accounts, Facebook blaming human nature for its need to censor, PayPal banning people

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,740
without warning or reason, and Google believing free speech is disastrous for society, I don't

63
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,340
know about you, but I can only see one conclusion.

64
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,780
Big tech is angry that the government won't police people's thoughts.

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,640
So they're going to try and do it themselves.

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,820
And the most bewildering part of it all is, if these neo-Marxists would just put down

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,700
their little red book, they'd realize that capitalism already has a social credit score

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
built right in.

69
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,180
It's called money.

70
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,720
I described this phenomenon in my previous video on why capitalism works, but let me

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,820
quickly reiterate.

72
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,180
With the exception of the ultra-rich and the ultra-poor, the amount of money you earn is

73
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,500
a rough estimate of how much value your actions have brought to other people's lives.

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,400
When you go to a job and get paid, you're performing work for the betterment of somebody

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
other than yourself.

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,260
In a sense, it's quite altruistic.

77
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,960
And then you get a reward in the form of little slips of paper, which would be the physical

78
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,280
representation of your social credit score.

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,380
The more people you help at your job, generally speaking, the more paperized social credit

80
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,380
you get.

81
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,460
And that's what money is.

82
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,560
And then you can trade in your social credit for other goods and services that you can't

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,940
provide yourself, and since the person you're hiring or buying from has added value to your

84
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,000
life through that good or service, they gain some social credit from you.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,040
This is why theft is immoral not only on a personal level, but on a social level.

86
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,340
Because it's gaining social credit that you didn't earn.

87
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,200
The reason the Chinese social credit score includes restrictions on what you can buy,

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,760
as well as why SJWs in the West get mad at consumer boycotts of their approved products,

89
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,520
like Gamergate or Comixgate or the panning of She-Ra or Han Solo, it's because they know

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,300
money already functions as a social credit score.

91
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,000
But because it's a bottom-up solution, they can't control it.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
To them, capitalism needs to be destroyed.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,240
Not because it's oppressive, despite what they say, but because it does not allow them

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
to become the oppressors.
