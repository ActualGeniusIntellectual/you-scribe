0	4280	So, China's social credit system has been making the rounds for the past few weeks on
4280	5320	social media.
5320	9680	The basic idea is that, in the near future, each of China's citizens will be ranked
9680	11220	by social credit.
11220	15040	People will be punished or rewarded based on their scores, and like financial credit
15040	18400	scores, will move up or down depending on their behavior.
18400	22300	Examples of bad behavior that would lower a person's score given by the Chinese government
22300	28360	includes bad driving, smoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games, and posting
28360	29920	fake news online.
29920	33440	Here's an incomplete list of things that can happen to you if you happen to have a
33440	34960	low enough credit score.
34960	37660	You can be banned from flying or traveling by train.
37660	39440	Your internet speeds can be throttled.
39440	44060	You or your kids can be banned from attending the best schools, working the best jobs, or
44060	45540	staying at the best hotels.
45540	47560	You will have your pets removed from you.
47560	50560	And the government will also have the option of publicly shaming you.
50560	54520	A prototype list already exists that the government is running tests with.
54520	58860	And most recently, Beijing has decided to go forward with full scale implementation
58860	62280	on all of the city's 22 million inhabitants by 2020.
62280	66740	Those with better so-called social credit will get green channel benefits, while those
66740	69420	who violate laws will find life more difficult.
69420	74000	The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy
74000	78260	will be unable to move even a single step, according to the government's plan.
78260	81940	If this sounds like a massive overreach of government power, as well as the violation
81940	85100	of the individual's right to a private life, hey, you'd be right.
85100	86100	But it's China.
86100	87140	It's not the West.
87140	88140	It's not the US.
88140	89140	It's not Canada.
89140	90140	It's not Europe.
90140	92580	We don't have anything to worry about, right?
92580	96540	Laura Loomer was just drummed off the internet, like Gavin McInnes and the Proud Boys, like
96540	99340	Alex Jones, like the Daily Stormer before her.
99340	103200	And Laura Loomer's actually pretty innocuous compared to those other examples.
103200	105800	She's an air-headed loon that's too attached to her tires.
105800	106800	But she's harmless.
106800	109240	However, she's also a high-profile conservative.
109240	113400	And with the radicals already purged away, people like her are the next to go.
113400	117820	Under a totalitarian form of government, like a fascist or communist state, nearly everything
117820	119200	is run top-down.
119200	122540	The government creates a plan encompassing the whole of society, and then attempts to
122540	123820	implement that plan.
123820	128460	However, in free societies, things are much more likely to be run bottom-up.
128460	133220	Individuals each build small sections of society piecemeal, according to their own inclinations,
133220	134700	ability and resources.
134700	138460	This is the fundamental difference between a controlled economy and the free market.
138460	140660	But it applies to more than economics.
140660	144220	Communist China has no problem with a top-down solution like a social credit score.
144220	147300	And it's pretty clear with the naming and shaming tactics that we see from the progressive
147300	151100	left nowadays that the Chinese solution is basically their wet dream.
151100	154780	But the citizens of free countries generally don't like the idea of the government becoming
154780	158260	the arbiter of not only the law, but of cultural morality.
158260	162060	And the more that a free country inches towards becoming that arbiter of cultural morality
162060	166740	– like, say, the UK with its hate speech laws – the less free and more centrally
166740	168440	planned that country becomes.
168440	172820	In the absence of a unified, government-enforced social credit system in the West, the progressives
172820	177480	within private businesses have taken it upon themselves to piecemeal construct such a system
177480	180620	– a top-down solution implemented in a bottom-up manner.
180620	185660	With YouTube banning problematic streams mid-broadcast, Twitter considering removing likes and follower
185660	190500	accounts, Facebook blaming human nature for its need to censor, PayPal banning people
190500	195740	without warning or reason, and Google believing free speech is disastrous for society, I don't
195740	198340	know about you, but I can only see one conclusion.
198340	201780	Big tech is angry that the government won't police people's thoughts.
201780	203640	So they're going to try and do it themselves.
203640	207820	And the most bewildering part of it all is, if these neo-Marxists would just put down
207820	211700	their little red book, they'd realize that capitalism already has a social credit score
211700	212700	built right in.
212700	214180	It's called money.
214180	217720	I described this phenomenon in my previous video on why capitalism works, but let me
217720	218820	quickly reiterate.
218820	223180	With the exception of the ultra-rich and the ultra-poor, the amount of money you earn is
223180	227500	a rough estimate of how much value your actions have brought to other people's lives.
227500	231400	When you go to a job and get paid, you're performing work for the betterment of somebody
231400	232520	other than yourself.
232520	234260	In a sense, it's quite altruistic.
234260	237960	And then you get a reward in the form of little slips of paper, which would be the physical
237960	240280	representation of your social credit score.
240280	244380	The more people you help at your job, generally speaking, the more paperized social credit
244380	245380	you get.
245380	246460	And that's what money is.
246460	249560	And then you can trade in your social credit for other goods and services that you can't
249560	253940	provide yourself, and since the person you're hiring or buying from has added value to your
253940	258000	life through that good or service, they gain some social credit from you.
258000	262040	This is why theft is immoral not only on a personal level, but on a social level.
262040	264340	Because it's gaining social credit that you didn't earn.
264340	268200	The reason the Chinese social credit score includes restrictions on what you can buy,
268200	273760	as well as why SJWs in the West get mad at consumer boycotts of their approved products,
273760	279520	like Gamergate or Comixgate or the panning of She-Ra or Han Solo, it's because they know
279520	282300	money already functions as a social credit score.
282300	285000	But because it's a bottom-up solution, they can't control it.
285000	287520	To them, capitalism needs to be destroyed.
287520	291240	Not because it's oppressive, despite what they say, but because it does not allow them
291240	292480	to become the oppressors.
