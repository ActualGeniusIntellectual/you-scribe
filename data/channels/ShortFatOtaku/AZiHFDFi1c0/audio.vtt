00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
So, China's social credit system has been making the rounds for the past few weeks on

00:04.280 --> 00:05.320
social media.

00:05.320 --> 00:09.680
The basic idea is that, in the near future, each of China's citizens will be ranked

00:09.680 --> 00:11.220
by social credit.

00:11.220 --> 00:15.040
People will be punished or rewarded based on their scores, and like financial credit

00:15.040 --> 00:18.400
scores, will move up or down depending on their behavior.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.300
Examples of bad behavior that would lower a person's score given by the Chinese government

00:22.300 --> 00:28.360
includes bad driving, smoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games, and posting

00:28.360 --> 00:29.920
fake news online.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.440
Here's an incomplete list of things that can happen to you if you happen to have a

00:33.440 --> 00:34.960
low enough credit score.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.660
You can be banned from flying or traveling by train.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.440
Your internet speeds can be throttled.

00:39.440 --> 00:44.060
You or your kids can be banned from attending the best schools, working the best jobs, or

00:44.060 --> 00:45.540
staying at the best hotels.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.560
You will have your pets removed from you.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.560
And the government will also have the option of publicly shaming you.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.520
A prototype list already exists that the government is running tests with.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.860
And most recently, Beijing has decided to go forward with full scale implementation

00:58.860 --> 01:02.280
on all of the city's 22 million inhabitants by 2020.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.740
Those with better so-called social credit will get green channel benefits, while those

01:06.740 --> 01:09.420
who violate laws will find life more difficult.

01:09.420 --> 01:14.000
The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy

01:14.000 --> 01:18.260
will be unable to move even a single step, according to the government's plan.

01:18.260 --> 01:21.940
If this sounds like a massive overreach of government power, as well as the violation

01:21.940 --> 01:25.100
of the individual's right to a private life, hey, you'd be right.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.100
But it's China.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.140
It's not the West.

01:27.140 --> 01:28.140
It's not the US.

01:28.140 --> 01:29.140
It's not Canada.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.140
It's not Europe.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.580
We don't have anything to worry about, right?

01:32.580 --> 01:36.540
Laura Loomer was just drummed off the internet, like Gavin McInnes and the Proud Boys, like

01:36.540 --> 01:39.340
Alex Jones, like the Daily Stormer before her.

01:39.340 --> 01:43.200
And Laura Loomer's actually pretty innocuous compared to those other examples.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.800
She's an air-headed loon that's too attached to her tires.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
But she's harmless.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.240
However, she's also a high-profile conservative.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.400
And with the radicals already purged away, people like her are the next to go.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.820
Under a totalitarian form of government, like a fascist or communist state, nearly everything

01:57.820 --> 01:59.200
is run top-down.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.540
The government creates a plan encompassing the whole of society, and then attempts to

02:02.540 --> 02:03.820
implement that plan.

02:03.820 --> 02:08.460
However, in free societies, things are much more likely to be run bottom-up.

02:08.460 --> 02:13.220
Individuals each build small sections of society piecemeal, according to their own inclinations,

02:13.220 --> 02:14.700
ability and resources.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.460
This is the fundamental difference between a controlled economy and the free market.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.660
But it applies to more than economics.

02:20.660 --> 02:24.220
Communist China has no problem with a top-down solution like a social credit score.

02:24.220 --> 02:27.300
And it's pretty clear with the naming and shaming tactics that we see from the progressive

02:27.300 --> 02:31.100
left nowadays that the Chinese solution is basically their wet dream.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.780
But the citizens of free countries generally don't like the idea of the government becoming

02:34.780 --> 02:38.260
the arbiter of not only the law, but of cultural morality.

02:38.260 --> 02:42.060
And the more that a free country inches towards becoming that arbiter of cultural morality

02:42.060 --> 02:46.740
– like, say, the UK with its hate speech laws – the less free and more centrally

02:46.740 --> 02:48.440
planned that country becomes.

02:48.440 --> 02:52.820
In the absence of a unified, government-enforced social credit system in the West, the progressives

02:52.820 --> 02:57.480
within private businesses have taken it upon themselves to piecemeal construct such a system

02:57.480 --> 03:00.620
– a top-down solution implemented in a bottom-up manner.

03:00.620 --> 03:05.660
With YouTube banning problematic streams mid-broadcast, Twitter considering removing likes and follower

03:05.660 --> 03:10.500
accounts, Facebook blaming human nature for its need to censor, PayPal banning people

03:10.500 --> 03:15.740
without warning or reason, and Google believing free speech is disastrous for society, I don't

03:15.740 --> 03:18.340
know about you, but I can only see one conclusion.

03:18.340 --> 03:21.780
Big tech is angry that the government won't police people's thoughts.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.640
So they're going to try and do it themselves.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.820
And the most bewildering part of it all is, if these neo-Marxists would just put down

03:27.820 --> 03:31.700
their little red book, they'd realize that capitalism already has a social credit score

03:31.700 --> 03:32.700
built right in.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.180
It's called money.

03:34.180 --> 03:37.720
I described this phenomenon in my previous video on why capitalism works, but let me

03:37.720 --> 03:38.820
quickly reiterate.

03:38.820 --> 03:43.180
With the exception of the ultra-rich and the ultra-poor, the amount of money you earn is

03:43.180 --> 03:47.500
a rough estimate of how much value your actions have brought to other people's lives.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.400
When you go to a job and get paid, you're performing work for the betterment of somebody

03:51.400 --> 03:52.520
other than yourself.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.260
In a sense, it's quite altruistic.

03:54.260 --> 03:57.960
And then you get a reward in the form of little slips of paper, which would be the physical

03:57.960 --> 04:00.280
representation of your social credit score.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.380
The more people you help at your job, generally speaking, the more paperized social credit

04:04.380 --> 04:05.380
you get.

04:05.380 --> 04:06.460
And that's what money is.

04:06.460 --> 04:09.560
And then you can trade in your social credit for other goods and services that you can't

04:09.560 --> 04:13.940
provide yourself, and since the person you're hiring or buying from has added value to your

04:13.940 --> 04:18.000
life through that good or service, they gain some social credit from you.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.040
This is why theft is immoral not only on a personal level, but on a social level.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.340
Because it's gaining social credit that you didn't earn.

04:24.340 --> 04:28.200
The reason the Chinese social credit score includes restrictions on what you can buy,

04:28.200 --> 04:33.760
as well as why SJWs in the West get mad at consumer boycotts of their approved products,

04:33.760 --> 04:39.520
like Gamergate or Comixgate or the panning of She-Ra or Han Solo, it's because they know

04:39.520 --> 04:42.300
money already functions as a social credit score.

04:42.300 --> 04:45.000
But because it's a bottom-up solution, they can't control it.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.520
To them, capitalism needs to be destroyed.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.240
Not because it's oppressive, despite what they say, but because it does not allow them

04:51.240 --> 04:52.480
to become the oppressors.
