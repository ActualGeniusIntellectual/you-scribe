1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
So, while I spent the last few weeks completely buried under a mountain of prison notebooks,

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,800
a few news cycles completely passed me by, and I still want to talk about them.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,640
It's okay, you're used to me being late to the party anyway, right?

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,380
There's a clip that went viral from a show on thehill.com called Rising.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,720
It seems to be a lefty online news outlet, where Bethany Mandel, a conservative journalist

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,160
and co-author of the book, Stolen Youth, How Radicals Are Erasing Innocence, and Indoctrinating

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,200
a Generation, was asked to define the word woke.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Let's check it out.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,920
Americans consider themselves very liberal, and probably fewer of them consider themselves

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
to be woke.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,760
And so, you know, when we talk about traditional- What does that mean to you?

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Would you mind defining woke?

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,680
Because it's come up a couple times, and I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:05,740
So I mean, woke is sort of the idea that- This is going to be one of those moments that

15
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,740
goes viral.

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,360
I mean, woke is something that's very hard to define, and we've spent an entire chapter

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,240
defining it.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,040
It is sort of the understanding that we need to totally reimagine and redo society in order

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,520
to create hierarchies of oppression.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,800
Sorry, it's hard to explain in a 15-second soundbite.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,320
Yeah, look at- Boy, she called it.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,100
Considering the topic of her book, and how often the word woke is used nowadays, you'd

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,600
think she'd have a definition on hand.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I know I do.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,160
I was asked to define the term by some permanently online Twitteroid a few days ago, and I gave

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
this answer.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,120
Wokeism is the ethics and processes of socialism expanded beyond class struggle to include

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,700
race struggle, gender struggle, sexual struggle, and any other near-infinite number of marginalized

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,000
groups as defined by intersectionality.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,040
I didn't really bring up wokeism or wokeness in my critical race theory video.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,760
It really wasn't necessary, I think.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Everyone got the point.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,900
But as a quick send-off, woke is just the latest term in that chain of ideology stretching

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,520
back to Antonio Gramsci.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,440
In fact, it's the Zoomer AAVE label for it.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,880
The wiki article on woke will tell you as much.

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,000
Woke is an adjective derived from African-American vernacular English, meaning alert to racial

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,720
prejudice and discrimination.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,960
Beginning in the 2010s, it came to encompass a broader awareness of social inequality such

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,080
as sexism, and has also been used as shorthand for American left ideas involving identity

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,880
politics and social justice, such as the notion of white privilege and slavery reparations

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,040
for African-Americans.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,060
The phrase stay woke has history in AAVE as far back as the 1930s.

44
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,480
In some contexts, referring to an awareness of the social and political issues affecting

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,800
African-Americans.

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,680
By 2020, however, members of the political center and right wing in several Western countries

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,460
were using the term woke in an ironic way, as an insult for various progressive or leftist

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,660
movements and ideologies perceived as overzealous, performative, or insincere.

49
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,960
This is a different definition than the one I gave earlier, so let's start by breaking

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,220
mine down.

51
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,780
Wokeism is the ethics and processes of socialism.

52
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,760
When I say woke ethics, I'm talking about wokeism valuing equality and collectivism

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,260
as a priori good like socialists do.

54
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,780
And when I say woke processes, I'm talking about wokeism using redistribution, planism,

55
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,420
and subversion to achieve those ethics, also like socialists do.

56
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,540
Expanded beyond class struggle to include race struggle, gender struggle, sexual struggle,

57
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,940
and any other near infinite number of marginalized groups as defined by intersectionality.

58
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,260
Where traditional Marxists confined their interests to class only, you may sometimes

59
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,060
hear the phrase, no war but class war.

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,380
Western Marxists, cultural Marxists, intersectionalists, wokeoids, whatever you want to call them,

61
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,780
they adapt the traditional Marxist form to other oppressed and oppressor groups.

62
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,340
And you can do this theoretically infinitely.

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,900
As long as you can identify an ingroup and an outgroup within any dynamic, the intersectional

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
lens applies.

65
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,700
However, don't expect most leftoids to be sympathetic to struggles outside of the usual

66
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,540
race, gender, sexuality ones.

67
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,720
So we have two definitions, the Wikipedia one and mine.

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,860
They have many similarities, but also a few key differences.

69
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,900
The Wikipedia one seems to be more surface level, referencing only being alert to prejudice.

70
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,400
While mine is based in their political theory and goes beyond simple alertness, relying

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,140
on lenses of analysis to critique liberalism.

72
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,060
These lenses can actually be used to uncover new truths and reform liberalism.

73
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,180
But their creators explicitly meant for them to be used to weaken liberalism in preparation

74
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,260
for a revolution.

75
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,620
The surface level definition has been used by a lot of left-wing commentators in attempts

76
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,580
to normalize wokeness.

77
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,320
As an example, check out this reply.

78
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,620
Mega folks are unable to define woke.

79
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,620
Why?

80
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,660
Because here's the real definition, being respectful and not a jerk.

81
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,560
For example, a bunch of Americans tonight will go to sleep holding their spouse who

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,100
is of the same sex.

83
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,300
If that somehow fills you with rage, then you are not woke.

84
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,640
Now it doesn't fill me with rage that people of the same sex go to sleep holding each other.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,240
I think girls holding each other is pretty hot, actually.

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720
And yet, I'm not woke.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,760
What's going on here is that people are taking that surface level definition of woke,

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,440
simply being aware of issues, rather than being a tuned out little droid or something,

89
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,880
and using it to push forward a sense of moral superiority.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,160
And why wouldn't they?

91
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,520
The left and the right both agree that more knowledge is generally good.

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,000
They both privilege the state of being informed over being ignorant.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,840
The right even has their own word for it, getting red pilled.

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,400
Woke and red pill describe being informed by different schools of thought, but they

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
appeal to the same sentiment.

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,960
Woke is the past tense form of wake, which is emerging from being asleep, awoken.

97
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
Red pill comes from the 1999 movie The Matrix, Jesus, it's been that long, where Neo is

98
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
given a choice between two pills.

99
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,360
The blue pill is the rejection of truth and the return to the mundane, dreamlike simulated

100
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,400
world of the Matrix.

101
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,720
The red pill is what allows Neo to leave the Matrix and experience the true reality for

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
the first time.

103
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,800
Both terms involve a metaphorical awakening, equating sleep with falsehood and consciousness

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
with truth.

105
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,000
And both political camps look down upon those who have not yet awoken or taken the red pill

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,520
as pitiable normies, while looking at those who have rejected the awakening or rejected

107
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,240
the red pill as valuing ignorance, perpetuating a comfortable lie, and acting in the service

108
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
of evil.

109
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,900
The actual truth is, of course, you should know all of the information that is contained

110
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,800
within both the woke and red pill knowledge sets, and you should not be ideologically

111
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,940
committed to acting out either theory.

112
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,760
The point I'm getting at, though, is when a leftoid tries to pin the label of woke to

113
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,400
the definition of just being a good person, that isn't actually an accurate statement

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
of what woke is.

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,880
The leftoid probably believes it is, but his belief serves a purpose.

116
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,760
Claiming what is normal, especially when what you're pushing is considered abnormal, is

117
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
a power move.

118
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,240
That is why there's always calls to normalize what is not normal.

119
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,680
Me personally, being a liberal idealist and all, I think that the normal should be what

120
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,200
is factually true, independent of power.

121
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,080
But not everyone sees things the way that I do.

122
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,440
If woke becomes just being a good person, then that is a backdoor wedge for all of the

123
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,080
other stuff contained within the woke label to slip in.

124
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,760
You're a normal person, right?

125
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,240
Well, then why aren't you, say, analyzing every police interaction you see using intersectional

126
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
theory, such that even black cops are white supremacists, and everything is all white

127
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
people's fault somehow?

128
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
Does that sound a bit weird to you?

129
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Well guess what?

130
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
It's woke.

131
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,240
That is what normal good people do.

132
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,460
And you want to be a normal good person, don't you?

133
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,840
You can see the subversion plainly.

134
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,400
You still don't believe it's a power play?

135
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,740
What I just described was how the left analyzes the left's use of the word woke.

136
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,880
When the left analyzes the right's use of the word woke, this is the result.

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,820
At this point, woke is a slur.

138
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,720
The way the right uses it is an undercover way of saying those people, or non-white people.

139
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,240
It's a polite way of saying the n-word, but in this case, the n-word includes blacks,

140
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,180
LGBTQ folks, and other marginalized groups.

141
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,840
Think back to the Antonio Gramsci video again, specifically to the part where I point out

142
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,820
that even their own labels used to identify their processes become problematic if someone

143
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,860
not in their political camp says them.

144
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,580
When my critical theory professor said cultural Marxism, he was talking about the name of

145
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,760
a philosophy.

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,860
When anybody not on the left says cultural Marxism, it's an anti-Semitic conspiracy

147
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,400
theory, and we're all Nazis for daring to use their language to describe their ideas.

148
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,260
It's the same thing with woke here.

149
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,540
It's actually funny that they're calling us Nazis over this.

150
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,660
Considering the Nazis were at least partially woke, no, really.

151
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,820
Consider the words of Mia Khalifa stunt double Ash Sarkar when she gave her definition of

152
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,820
woke.

153
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:35,780
Woke is accepting that LGBT identities are valid and should be protected under the law.

154
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:42,580
That woke culture is an acknowledgement that there are racialized outcomes reproduced through

155
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:49,420
institutions in society and people of color measurably are treated differently.

156
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:56,220
What I want at an interpersonal level is understanding empathy and solidarity on a political level.

157
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,100
I want the pursuit of redistributive goals, whether that's power, whether that's wealth,

158
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,180
whether that's land, um, in order to pursue aims of social justice along class, gender,

159
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,540
and race lines.

160
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,480
If you cut away all the fat here, she's actually given us a pretty good formulation.

161
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,060
Redistribution of land, power, and wealth along race, gender, and class lines.

162
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,280
Is that not what the actual Nazis did?

163
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,020
Not with gender, obviously, but race and class?

164
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Absolutely.

165
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,620
This is why liberals, with their pesky colorblindness, can actually see the socialism that exists

166
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,360
within national socialism.

167
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,260
It isn't the same type of socialism that your average anti-fagoon would want to see

168
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,100
implemented, but it is a form of socialism.

169
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,820
And as liberals, we should be against all of it.

170
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Here, you know what?

171
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,520
You want to know what wokeism is?

172
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Here it is.

173
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,020
McDonald's in the 1990s versus McDonald's today.

174
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,260
This picture is a great representation.

175
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,420
I know I sound like I'm joking, and I kind of am, but I'm also kind of not.

176
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,380
I mentioned in my video on indigeneity that the broader left creates its own demons to

177
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
fight.

178
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,020
You will find leftists who decry capitalism because, in Marxian terms, it turns labor

179
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,380
into a commodity that is bought and sold, where the individual is a replaceable cog

180
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,420
in a vast corporate machine that exists only to produce.

181
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,460
But at the same time, these same leftists will call for the dissolution of borders,

182
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,340
the mixing of all peoples and cultures into one gray, unidentifiable sludge where all

183
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,060
cultural difference is destroyed.

184
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,940
The left's demand for fungible culture, where in order not to offend anybody everything

185
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,560
must be mixed into one universalized culture, is what creates the environment for the fungible

186
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,660
economics that they hate so much.

187
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,700
The left creates a replaceability culture which generates replaceability economics,

188
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,260
and then they cry about it as it replaces them.

189
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,020
What does McDonald's have to do with any of this?

190
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,460
Well, compare the two pictures.

191
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,960
The top one is particular.

192
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,940
It is undeniably McDonald's.

193
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,380
For non-McDonald's fans, this isn't appealing to you.

194
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
But if you love McDonald's, this is home sweet home.

195
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,640
It is less universalized, more specific.

196
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,660
It will certainly attract less customers, but it retains its loveability for those customers

197
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,900
who do enjoy it.

198
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,920
Meanwhile, the bottom picture is universal.

199
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,280
It could be any restaurant.

200
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,660
Less people are offended, but less people love it.

201
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,060
More people will likely eat here, but nobody will truly enjoy it the way that McDonald's

202
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,580
fans enjoyed the first picture.

203
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,720
Like I said, the left demands fungible culture, while decrying the fungible economic structure

204
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,860
that culture is inherently intertwined with.

205
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,740
That is the end result of wokeism.

206
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,300
After you remove all the irregular bits that might offend somebody's sensibilities, there's

207
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,540
no reason you wouldn't end up in a padded room civilization, where nobody is uncomfortable

208
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,060
but nobody grows.

209
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,980
Despite these people loudly proclaiming progress, this philosophy always leads to stagnation.

210
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,020
Oh, there's one more thing to talk about real quick.

211
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,220
I know I was given $500 to shave my hair into a mohawk.

212
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,700
Well, I've got it now.

213
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,100
And if you want to see that video, head over to the side channel, the dev kit, or click

214
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
on the link on screen.

215
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,820
I don't know why you want to see me getting my head shaved, but there it is.

216
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I'll see you there, guys.

217
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,380
I love you.
