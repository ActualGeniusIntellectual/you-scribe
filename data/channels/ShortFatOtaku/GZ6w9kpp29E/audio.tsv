0	11760	So, while I spent the last few weeks completely buried under a mountain of prison notebooks,
11760	15800	a few news cycles completely passed me by, and I still want to talk about them.
15800	18640	It's okay, you're used to me being late to the party anyway, right?
18640	23380	There's a clip that went viral from a show on thehill.com called Rising.
23380	28720	It seems to be a lefty online news outlet, where Bethany Mandel, a conservative journalist
28720	34160	and co-author of the book, Stolen Youth, How Radicals Are Erasing Innocence, and Indoctrinating
34160	37200	a Generation, was asked to define the word woke.
37200	38200	Let's check it out.
38200	42920	Americans consider themselves very liberal, and probably fewer of them consider themselves
42920	43920	to be woke.
43920	46760	And so, you know, when we talk about traditional- What does that mean to you?
46760	47760	Would you mind defining woke?
47760	51680	Because it's come up a couple times, and I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
51680	65740	So I mean, woke is sort of the idea that- This is going to be one of those moments that
65740	66740	goes viral.
66740	70360	I mean, woke is something that's very hard to define, and we've spent an entire chapter
70360	72240	defining it.
72240	79040	It is sort of the understanding that we need to totally reimagine and redo society in order
79040	82520	to create hierarchies of oppression.
82520	88800	Sorry, it's hard to explain in a 15-second soundbite.
88800	91320	Yeah, look at- Boy, she called it.
91320	95100	Considering the topic of her book, and how often the word woke is used nowadays, you'd
95100	96600	think she'd have a definition on hand.
96600	97600	I know I do.
97600	102160	I was asked to define the term by some permanently online Twitteroid a few days ago, and I gave
102160	103160	this answer.
103160	108120	Wokeism is the ethics and processes of socialism expanded beyond class struggle to include
108120	113700	race struggle, gender struggle, sexual struggle, and any other near-infinite number of marginalized
113700	116000	groups as defined by intersectionality.
116000	120040	I didn't really bring up wokeism or wokeness in my critical race theory video.
120040	121760	It really wasn't necessary, I think.
121760	122760	Everyone got the point.
122760	126900	But as a quick send-off, woke is just the latest term in that chain of ideology stretching
126900	128520	back to Antonio Gramsci.
128520	131440	In fact, it's the Zoomer AAVE label for it.
131440	133880	The wiki article on woke will tell you as much.
133880	139000	Woke is an adjective derived from African-American vernacular English, meaning alert to racial
139000	140720	prejudice and discrimination.
140720	144960	Beginning in the 2010s, it came to encompass a broader awareness of social inequality such
144960	150080	as sexism, and has also been used as shorthand for American left ideas involving identity
150080	154880	politics and social justice, such as the notion of white privilege and slavery reparations
154880	156040	for African-Americans.
156040	161060	The phrase stay woke has history in AAVE as far back as the 1930s.
161060	165480	In some contexts, referring to an awareness of the social and political issues affecting
165480	166800	African-Americans.
166800	171680	By 2020, however, members of the political center and right wing in several Western countries
171680	176460	were using the term woke in an ironic way, as an insult for various progressive or leftist
176460	181660	movements and ideologies perceived as overzealous, performative, or insincere.
181660	184960	This is a different definition than the one I gave earlier, so let's start by breaking
184960	186220	mine down.
186220	188780	Wokeism is the ethics and processes of socialism.
188780	193760	When I say woke ethics, I'm talking about wokeism valuing equality and collectivism
193760	196260	as a priori good like socialists do.
196260	200780	And when I say woke processes, I'm talking about wokeism using redistribution, planism,
200780	204420	and subversion to achieve those ethics, also like socialists do.
204420	208540	Expanded beyond class struggle to include race struggle, gender struggle, sexual struggle,
208540	212940	and any other near infinite number of marginalized groups as defined by intersectionality.
212940	216260	Where traditional Marxists confined their interests to class only, you may sometimes
216260	219060	hear the phrase, no war but class war.
219060	223380	Western Marxists, cultural Marxists, intersectionalists, wokeoids, whatever you want to call them,
223380	227780	they adapt the traditional Marxist form to other oppressed and oppressor groups.
227780	230340	And you can do this theoretically infinitely.
230340	234900	As long as you can identify an ingroup and an outgroup within any dynamic, the intersectional
234900	235900	lens applies.
235900	240700	However, don't expect most leftoids to be sympathetic to struggles outside of the usual
240700	243540	race, gender, sexuality ones.
243540	246720	So we have two definitions, the Wikipedia one and mine.
246720	249860	They have many similarities, but also a few key differences.
249860	254900	The Wikipedia one seems to be more surface level, referencing only being alert to prejudice.
254900	259400	While mine is based in their political theory and goes beyond simple alertness, relying
259400	262140	on lenses of analysis to critique liberalism.
262140	267060	These lenses can actually be used to uncover new truths and reform liberalism.
267060	272180	But their creators explicitly meant for them to be used to weaken liberalism in preparation
272180	273260	for a revolution.
273260	277620	The surface level definition has been used by a lot of left-wing commentators in attempts
277620	279580	to normalize wokeness.
279580	281320	As an example, check out this reply.
281320	283620	Mega folks are unable to define woke.
283620	284620	Why?
284620	287660	Because here's the real definition, being respectful and not a jerk.
287660	291560	For example, a bunch of Americans tonight will go to sleep holding their spouse who
291560	293100	is of the same sex.
293100	296300	If that somehow fills you with rage, then you are not woke.
296300	300640	Now it doesn't fill me with rage that people of the same sex go to sleep holding each other.
300640	303240	I think girls holding each other is pretty hot, actually.
303240	304720	And yet, I'm not woke.
304720	308760	What's going on here is that people are taking that surface level definition of woke,
308760	313440	simply being aware of issues, rather than being a tuned out little droid or something,
313440	315880	and using it to push forward a sense of moral superiority.
315880	317160	And why wouldn't they?
317160	320520	The left and the right both agree that more knowledge is generally good.
320520	324000	They both privilege the state of being informed over being ignorant.
324000	326840	The right even has their own word for it, getting red pilled.
326880	330400	Woke and red pill describe being informed by different schools of thought, but they
330400	332240	appeal to the same sentiment.
332240	336960	Woke is the past tense form of wake, which is emerging from being asleep, awoken.
336960	341520	Red pill comes from the 1999 movie The Matrix, Jesus, it's been that long, where Neo is
341520	343280	given a choice between two pills.
343280	347360	The blue pill is the rejection of truth and the return to the mundane, dreamlike simulated
347360	348400	world of the Matrix.
348400	352720	The red pill is what allows Neo to leave the Matrix and experience the true reality for
352720	353720	the first time.
353720	358800	Both terms involve a metaphorical awakening, equating sleep with falsehood and consciousness
358800	359800	with truth.
359800	364000	And both political camps look down upon those who have not yet awoken or taken the red pill
364000	368520	as pitiable normies, while looking at those who have rejected the awakening or rejected
368520	373240	the red pill as valuing ignorance, perpetuating a comfortable lie, and acting in the service
373240	374240	of evil.
374240	377900	The actual truth is, of course, you should know all of the information that is contained
377900	382800	within both the woke and red pill knowledge sets, and you should not be ideologically
382800	384940	committed to acting out either theory.
384940	388760	The point I'm getting at, though, is when a leftoid tries to pin the label of woke to
388760	393400	the definition of just being a good person, that isn't actually an accurate statement
393400	394400	of what woke is.
394400	397880	The leftoid probably believes it is, but his belief serves a purpose.
397880	401760	Claiming what is normal, especially when what you're pushing is considered abnormal, is
401760	402760	a power move.
402760	406240	That is why there's always calls to normalize what is not normal.
406240	410680	Me personally, being a liberal idealist and all, I think that the normal should be what
410680	413200	is factually true, independent of power.
413200	415080	But not everyone sees things the way that I do.
415080	420440	If woke becomes just being a good person, then that is a backdoor wedge for all of the
420440	423080	other stuff contained within the woke label to slip in.
423080	424760	You're a normal person, right?
424760	430240	Well, then why aren't you, say, analyzing every police interaction you see using intersectional
430240	434840	theory, such that even black cops are white supremacists, and everything is all white
434840	435840	people's fault somehow?
435840	437360	Does that sound a bit weird to you?
437360	438360	Well guess what?
438360	439360	It's woke.
439360	441240	That is what normal good people do.
441240	443460	And you want to be a normal good person, don't you?
443460	444840	You can see the subversion plainly.
444840	446400	You still don't believe it's a power play?
446400	450740	What I just described was how the left analyzes the left's use of the word woke.
450740	454880	When the left analyzes the right's use of the word woke, this is the result.
454880	456820	At this point, woke is a slur.
456820	461720	The way the right uses it is an undercover way of saying those people, or non-white people.
461720	466240	It's a polite way of saying the n-word, but in this case, the n-word includes blacks,
466240	469180	LGBTQ folks, and other marginalized groups.
469180	472840	Think back to the Antonio Gramsci video again, specifically to the part where I point out
472840	477820	that even their own labels used to identify their processes become problematic if someone
477820	479860	not in their political camp says them.
479860	483580	When my critical theory professor said cultural Marxism, he was talking about the name of
483580	484760	a philosophy.
484760	488860	When anybody not on the left says cultural Marxism, it's an anti-Semitic conspiracy
488860	493400	theory, and we're all Nazis for daring to use their language to describe their ideas.
493400	495260	It's the same thing with woke here.
495260	497540	It's actually funny that they're calling us Nazis over this.
497540	501660	Considering the Nazis were at least partially woke, no, really.
501660	506820	Consider the words of Mia Khalifa stunt double Ash Sarkar when she gave her definition of
506820	507820	woke.
507820	515780	Woke is accepting that LGBT identities are valid and should be protected under the law.
515780	522580	That woke culture is an acknowledgement that there are racialized outcomes reproduced through
522580	529420	institutions in society and people of color measurably are treated differently.
529420	536220	What I want at an interpersonal level is understanding empathy and solidarity on a political level.
536220	542100	I want the pursuit of redistributive goals, whether that's power, whether that's wealth,
542100	548180	whether that's land, um, in order to pursue aims of social justice along class, gender,
548180	549540	and race lines.
549540	553480	If you cut away all the fat here, she's actually given us a pretty good formulation.
553480	558060	Redistribution of land, power, and wealth along race, gender, and class lines.
558060	560280	Is that not what the actual Nazis did?
560280	563020	Not with gender, obviously, but race and class?
563020	564020	Absolutely.
564020	568620	This is why liberals, with their pesky colorblindness, can actually see the socialism that exists
568620	570360	within national socialism.
570360	574260	It isn't the same type of socialism that your average anti-fagoon would want to see
574260	577100	implemented, but it is a form of socialism.
577100	579820	And as liberals, we should be against all of it.
579820	580820	Here, you know what?
580820	582520	You want to know what wokeism is?
582520	583520	Here it is.
583520	586020	McDonald's in the 1990s versus McDonald's today.
586020	587260	This picture is a great representation.
587260	590420	I know I sound like I'm joking, and I kind of am, but I'm also kind of not.
590420	595380	I mentioned in my video on indigeneity that the broader left creates its own demons to
595380	596380	fight.
596380	600020	You will find leftists who decry capitalism because, in Marxian terms, it turns labor
600020	604380	into a commodity that is bought and sold, where the individual is a replaceable cog
604380	607420	in a vast corporate machine that exists only to produce.
607420	611460	But at the same time, these same leftists will call for the dissolution of borders,
611460	616340	the mixing of all peoples and cultures into one gray, unidentifiable sludge where all
616340	618060	cultural difference is destroyed.
618060	621940	The left's demand for fungible culture, where in order not to offend anybody everything
621940	626560	must be mixed into one universalized culture, is what creates the environment for the fungible
626560	628660	economics that they hate so much.
628660	632700	The left creates a replaceability culture which generates replaceability economics,
632700	635260	and then they cry about it as it replaces them.
635260	637020	What does McDonald's have to do with any of this?
637020	638460	Well, compare the two pictures.
638460	639960	The top one is particular.
639960	641940	It is undeniably McDonald's.
641940	644380	For non-McDonald's fans, this isn't appealing to you.
644380	646380	But if you love McDonald's, this is home sweet home.
646380	648640	It is less universalized, more specific.
648640	652660	It will certainly attract less customers, but it retains its loveability for those customers
652660	653900	who do enjoy it.
653900	655920	Meanwhile, the bottom picture is universal.
655920	657280	It could be any restaurant.
657280	659660	Less people are offended, but less people love it.
659660	664060	More people will likely eat here, but nobody will truly enjoy it the way that McDonald's
664060	665580	fans enjoyed the first picture.
665580	669720	Like I said, the left demands fungible culture, while decrying the fungible economic structure
669720	671860	that culture is inherently intertwined with.
671860	673740	That is the end result of wokeism.
673740	677300	After you remove all the irregular bits that might offend somebody's sensibilities, there's
677300	681540	no reason you wouldn't end up in a padded room civilization, where nobody is uncomfortable
681540	683060	but nobody grows.
683060	687980	Despite these people loudly proclaiming progress, this philosophy always leads to stagnation.
687980	691020	Oh, there's one more thing to talk about real quick.
691020	695220	I know I was given $500 to shave my hair into a mohawk.
695220	696700	Well, I've got it now.
696700	700100	And if you want to see that video, head over to the side channel, the dev kit, or click
700100	701100	on the link on screen.
701100	704820	I don't know why you want to see me getting my head shaved, but there it is.
704820	705820	I'll see you there, guys.
705820	706380	I love you.
