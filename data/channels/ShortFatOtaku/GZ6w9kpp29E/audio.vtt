WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.760
So, while I spent the last few weeks completely buried under a mountain of prison notebooks,

00:11.760 --> 00:15.800
a few news cycles completely passed me by, and I still want to talk about them.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.640
It's okay, you're used to me being late to the party anyway, right?

00:18.640 --> 00:23.380
There's a clip that went viral from a show on thehill.com called Rising.

00:23.380 --> 00:28.720
It seems to be a lefty online news outlet, where Bethany Mandel, a conservative journalist

00:28.720 --> 00:34.160
and co-author of the book, Stolen Youth, How Radicals Are Erasing Innocence, and Indoctrinating

00:34.160 --> 00:37.200
a Generation, was asked to define the word woke.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
Let's check it out.

00:38.200 --> 00:42.920
Americans consider themselves very liberal, and probably fewer of them consider themselves

00:42.920 --> 00:43.920
to be woke.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.760
And so, you know, when we talk about traditional- What does that mean to you?

00:46.760 --> 00:47.760
Would you mind defining woke?

00:47.760 --> 00:51.680
Because it's come up a couple times, and I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

00:51.680 --> 01:05.740
So I mean, woke is sort of the idea that- This is going to be one of those moments that

01:05.740 --> 01:06.740
goes viral.

01:06.740 --> 01:10.360
I mean, woke is something that's very hard to define, and we've spent an entire chapter

01:10.360 --> 01:12.240
defining it.

01:12.240 --> 01:19.040
It is sort of the understanding that we need to totally reimagine and redo society in order

01:19.040 --> 01:22.520
to create hierarchies of oppression.

01:22.520 --> 01:28.800
Sorry, it's hard to explain in a 15-second soundbite.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.320
Yeah, look at- Boy, she called it.

01:31.320 --> 01:35.100
Considering the topic of her book, and how often the word woke is used nowadays, you'd

01:35.100 --> 01:36.600
think she'd have a definition on hand.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600
I know I do.

01:37.600 --> 01:42.160
I was asked to define the term by some permanently online Twitteroid a few days ago, and I gave

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
this answer.

01:43.160 --> 01:48.120
Wokeism is the ethics and processes of socialism expanded beyond class struggle to include

01:48.120 --> 01:53.700
race struggle, gender struggle, sexual struggle, and any other near-infinite number of marginalized

01:53.700 --> 01:56.000
groups as defined by intersectionality.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.040
I didn't really bring up wokeism or wokeness in my critical race theory video.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.760
It really wasn't necessary, I think.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
Everyone got the point.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.900
But as a quick send-off, woke is just the latest term in that chain of ideology stretching

02:06.900 --> 02:08.520
back to Antonio Gramsci.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.440
In fact, it's the Zoomer AAVE label for it.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.880
The wiki article on woke will tell you as much.

02:13.880 --> 02:19.000
Woke is an adjective derived from African-American vernacular English, meaning alert to racial

02:19.000 --> 02:20.720
prejudice and discrimination.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.960
Beginning in the 2010s, it came to encompass a broader awareness of social inequality such

02:24.960 --> 02:30.080
as sexism, and has also been used as shorthand for American left ideas involving identity

02:30.080 --> 02:34.880
politics and social justice, such as the notion of white privilege and slavery reparations

02:34.880 --> 02:36.040
for African-Americans.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.060
The phrase stay woke has history in AAVE as far back as the 1930s.

02:41.060 --> 02:45.480
In some contexts, referring to an awareness of the social and political issues affecting

02:45.480 --> 02:46.800
African-Americans.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.680
By 2020, however, members of the political center and right wing in several Western countries

02:51.680 --> 02:56.460
were using the term woke in an ironic way, as an insult for various progressive or leftist

02:56.460 --> 03:01.660
movements and ideologies perceived as overzealous, performative, or insincere.

03:01.660 --> 03:04.960
This is a different definition than the one I gave earlier, so let's start by breaking

03:04.960 --> 03:06.220
mine down.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.780
Wokeism is the ethics and processes of socialism.

03:08.780 --> 03:13.760
When I say woke ethics, I'm talking about wokeism valuing equality and collectivism

03:13.760 --> 03:16.260
as a priori good like socialists do.

03:16.260 --> 03:20.780
And when I say woke processes, I'm talking about wokeism using redistribution, planism,

03:20.780 --> 03:24.420
and subversion to achieve those ethics, also like socialists do.

03:24.420 --> 03:28.540
Expanded beyond class struggle to include race struggle, gender struggle, sexual struggle,

03:28.540 --> 03:32.940
and any other near infinite number of marginalized groups as defined by intersectionality.

03:32.940 --> 03:36.260
Where traditional Marxists confined their interests to class only, you may sometimes

03:36.260 --> 03:39.060
hear the phrase, no war but class war.

03:39.060 --> 03:43.380
Western Marxists, cultural Marxists, intersectionalists, wokeoids, whatever you want to call them,

03:43.380 --> 03:47.780
they adapt the traditional Marxist form to other oppressed and oppressor groups.

03:47.780 --> 03:50.340
And you can do this theoretically infinitely.

03:50.340 --> 03:54.900
As long as you can identify an ingroup and an outgroup within any dynamic, the intersectional

03:54.900 --> 03:55.900
lens applies.

03:55.900 --> 04:00.700
However, don't expect most leftoids to be sympathetic to struggles outside of the usual

04:00.700 --> 04:03.540
race, gender, sexuality ones.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.720
So we have two definitions, the Wikipedia one and mine.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.860
They have many similarities, but also a few key differences.

04:09.860 --> 04:14.900
The Wikipedia one seems to be more surface level, referencing only being alert to prejudice.

04:14.900 --> 04:19.400
While mine is based in their political theory and goes beyond simple alertness, relying

04:19.400 --> 04:22.140
on lenses of analysis to critique liberalism.

04:22.140 --> 04:27.060
These lenses can actually be used to uncover new truths and reform liberalism.

04:27.060 --> 04:32.180
But their creators explicitly meant for them to be used to weaken liberalism in preparation

04:32.180 --> 04:33.260
for a revolution.

04:33.260 --> 04:37.620
The surface level definition has been used by a lot of left-wing commentators in attempts

04:37.620 --> 04:39.580
to normalize wokeness.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.320
As an example, check out this reply.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.620
Mega folks are unable to define woke.

04:43.620 --> 04:44.620
Why?

04:44.620 --> 04:47.660
Because here's the real definition, being respectful and not a jerk.

04:47.660 --> 04:51.560
For example, a bunch of Americans tonight will go to sleep holding their spouse who

04:51.560 --> 04:53.100
is of the same sex.

04:53.100 --> 04:56.300
If that somehow fills you with rage, then you are not woke.

04:56.300 --> 05:00.640
Now it doesn't fill me with rage that people of the same sex go to sleep holding each other.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.240
I think girls holding each other is pretty hot, actually.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.720
And yet, I'm not woke.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.760
What's going on here is that people are taking that surface level definition of woke,

05:08.760 --> 05:13.440
simply being aware of issues, rather than being a tuned out little droid or something,

05:13.440 --> 05:15.880
and using it to push forward a sense of moral superiority.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.160
And why wouldn't they?

05:17.160 --> 05:20.520
The left and the right both agree that more knowledge is generally good.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.000
They both privilege the state of being informed over being ignorant.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.840
The right even has their own word for it, getting red pilled.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.400
Woke and red pill describe being informed by different schools of thought, but they

05:30.400 --> 05:32.240
appeal to the same sentiment.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.960
Woke is the past tense form of wake, which is emerging from being asleep, awoken.

05:36.960 --> 05:41.520
Red pill comes from the 1999 movie The Matrix, Jesus, it's been that long, where Neo is

05:41.520 --> 05:43.280
given a choice between two pills.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.360
The blue pill is the rejection of truth and the return to the mundane, dreamlike simulated

05:47.360 --> 05:48.400
world of the Matrix.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.720
The red pill is what allows Neo to leave the Matrix and experience the true reality for

05:52.720 --> 05:53.720
the first time.

05:53.720 --> 05:58.800
Both terms involve a metaphorical awakening, equating sleep with falsehood and consciousness

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
with truth.

05:59.800 --> 06:04.000
And both political camps look down upon those who have not yet awoken or taken the red pill

06:04.000 --> 06:08.520
as pitiable normies, while looking at those who have rejected the awakening or rejected

06:08.520 --> 06:13.240
the red pill as valuing ignorance, perpetuating a comfortable lie, and acting in the service

06:13.240 --> 06:14.240
of evil.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.900
The actual truth is, of course, you should know all of the information that is contained

06:17.900 --> 06:22.800
within both the woke and red pill knowledge sets, and you should not be ideologically

06:22.800 --> 06:24.940
committed to acting out either theory.

06:24.940 --> 06:28.760
The point I'm getting at, though, is when a leftoid tries to pin the label of woke to

06:28.760 --> 06:33.400
the definition of just being a good person, that isn't actually an accurate statement

06:33.400 --> 06:34.400
of what woke is.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.880
The leftoid probably believes it is, but his belief serves a purpose.

06:37.880 --> 06:41.760
Claiming what is normal, especially when what you're pushing is considered abnormal, is

06:41.760 --> 06:42.760
a power move.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.240
That is why there's always calls to normalize what is not normal.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.680
Me personally, being a liberal idealist and all, I think that the normal should be what

06:50.680 --> 06:53.200
is factually true, independent of power.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.080
But not everyone sees things the way that I do.

06:55.080 --> 07:00.440
If woke becomes just being a good person, then that is a backdoor wedge for all of the

07:00.440 --> 07:03.080
other stuff contained within the woke label to slip in.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.760
You're a normal person, right?

07:04.760 --> 07:10.240
Well, then why aren't you, say, analyzing every police interaction you see using intersectional

07:10.240 --> 07:14.840
theory, such that even black cops are white supremacists, and everything is all white

07:14.840 --> 07:15.840
people's fault somehow?

07:15.840 --> 07:17.360
Does that sound a bit weird to you?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
Well guess what?

07:18.360 --> 07:19.360
It's woke.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.240
That is what normal good people do.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.460
And you want to be a normal good person, don't you?

07:23.460 --> 07:24.840
You can see the subversion plainly.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.400
You still don't believe it's a power play?

07:26.400 --> 07:30.740
What I just described was how the left analyzes the left's use of the word woke.

07:30.740 --> 07:34.880
When the left analyzes the right's use of the word woke, this is the result.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.820
At this point, woke is a slur.

07:36.820 --> 07:41.720
The way the right uses it is an undercover way of saying those people, or non-white people.

07:41.720 --> 07:46.240
It's a polite way of saying the n-word, but in this case, the n-word includes blacks,

07:46.240 --> 07:49.180
LGBTQ folks, and other marginalized groups.

07:49.180 --> 07:52.840
Think back to the Antonio Gramsci video again, specifically to the part where I point out

07:52.840 --> 07:57.820
that even their own labels used to identify their processes become problematic if someone

07:57.820 --> 07:59.860
not in their political camp says them.

07:59.860 --> 08:03.580
When my critical theory professor said cultural Marxism, he was talking about the name of

08:03.580 --> 08:04.760
a philosophy.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.860
When anybody not on the left says cultural Marxism, it's an anti-Semitic conspiracy

08:08.860 --> 08:13.400
theory, and we're all Nazis for daring to use their language to describe their ideas.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.260
It's the same thing with woke here.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.540
It's actually funny that they're calling us Nazis over this.

08:17.540 --> 08:21.660
Considering the Nazis were at least partially woke, no, really.

08:21.660 --> 08:26.820
Consider the words of Mia Khalifa stunt double Ash Sarkar when she gave her definition of

08:26.820 --> 08:27.820
woke.

08:27.820 --> 08:35.780
Woke is accepting that LGBT identities are valid and should be protected under the law.

08:35.780 --> 08:42.580
That woke culture is an acknowledgement that there are racialized outcomes reproduced through

08:42.580 --> 08:49.420
institutions in society and people of color measurably are treated differently.

08:49.420 --> 08:56.220
What I want at an interpersonal level is understanding empathy and solidarity on a political level.

08:56.220 --> 09:02.100
I want the pursuit of redistributive goals, whether that's power, whether that's wealth,

09:02.100 --> 09:08.180
whether that's land, um, in order to pursue aims of social justice along class, gender,

09:08.180 --> 09:09.540
and race lines.

09:09.540 --> 09:13.480
If you cut away all the fat here, she's actually given us a pretty good formulation.

09:13.480 --> 09:18.060
Redistribution of land, power, and wealth along race, gender, and class lines.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.280
Is that not what the actual Nazis did?

09:20.280 --> 09:23.020
Not with gender, obviously, but race and class?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.020
Absolutely.

09:24.020 --> 09:28.620
This is why liberals, with their pesky colorblindness, can actually see the socialism that exists

09:28.620 --> 09:30.360
within national socialism.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.260
It isn't the same type of socialism that your average anti-fagoon would want to see

09:34.260 --> 09:37.100
implemented, but it is a form of socialism.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.820
And as liberals, we should be against all of it.

09:39.820 --> 09:40.820
Here, you know what?

09:40.820 --> 09:42.520
You want to know what wokeism is?

09:42.520 --> 09:43.520
Here it is.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.020
McDonald's in the 1990s versus McDonald's today.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.260
This picture is a great representation.

09:47.260 --> 09:50.420
I know I sound like I'm joking, and I kind of am, but I'm also kind of not.

09:50.420 --> 09:55.380
I mentioned in my video on indigeneity that the broader left creates its own demons to

09:55.380 --> 09:56.380
fight.

09:56.380 --> 10:00.020
You will find leftists who decry capitalism because, in Marxian terms, it turns labor

10:00.020 --> 10:04.380
into a commodity that is bought and sold, where the individual is a replaceable cog

10:04.380 --> 10:07.420
in a vast corporate machine that exists only to produce.

10:07.420 --> 10:11.460
But at the same time, these same leftists will call for the dissolution of borders,

10:11.460 --> 10:16.340
the mixing of all peoples and cultures into one gray, unidentifiable sludge where all

10:16.340 --> 10:18.060
cultural difference is destroyed.

10:18.060 --> 10:21.940
The left's demand for fungible culture, where in order not to offend anybody everything

10:21.940 --> 10:26.560
must be mixed into one universalized culture, is what creates the environment for the fungible

10:26.560 --> 10:28.660
economics that they hate so much.

10:28.660 --> 10:32.700
The left creates a replaceability culture which generates replaceability economics,

10:32.700 --> 10:35.260
and then they cry about it as it replaces them.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.020
What does McDonald's have to do with any of this?

10:37.020 --> 10:38.460
Well, compare the two pictures.

10:38.460 --> 10:39.960
The top one is particular.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.940
It is undeniably McDonald's.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.380
For non-McDonald's fans, this isn't appealing to you.

10:44.380 --> 10:46.380
But if you love McDonald's, this is home sweet home.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.640
It is less universalized, more specific.

10:48.640 --> 10:52.660
It will certainly attract less customers, but it retains its loveability for those customers

10:52.660 --> 10:53.900
who do enjoy it.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.920
Meanwhile, the bottom picture is universal.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.280
It could be any restaurant.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.660
Less people are offended, but less people love it.

10:59.660 --> 11:04.060
More people will likely eat here, but nobody will truly enjoy it the way that McDonald's

11:04.060 --> 11:05.580
fans enjoyed the first picture.

11:05.580 --> 11:09.720
Like I said, the left demands fungible culture, while decrying the fungible economic structure

11:09.720 --> 11:11.860
that culture is inherently intertwined with.

11:11.860 --> 11:13.740
That is the end result of wokeism.

11:13.740 --> 11:17.300
After you remove all the irregular bits that might offend somebody's sensibilities, there's

11:17.300 --> 11:21.540
no reason you wouldn't end up in a padded room civilization, where nobody is uncomfortable

11:21.540 --> 11:23.060
but nobody grows.

11:23.060 --> 11:27.980
Despite these people loudly proclaiming progress, this philosophy always leads to stagnation.

11:27.980 --> 11:31.020
Oh, there's one more thing to talk about real quick.

11:31.020 --> 11:35.220
I know I was given $500 to shave my hair into a mohawk.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.700
Well, I've got it now.

11:36.700 --> 11:40.100
And if you want to see that video, head over to the side channel, the dev kit, or click

11:40.100 --> 11:41.100
on the link on screen.

I don't know why you want to see me getting my head shaved, but there it is.

11:44.820 --> 11:45.820
I'll see you there, guys.

11:45.820 --> 11:46.380
I love you.
