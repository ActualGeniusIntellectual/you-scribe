WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
hey guys how's it going dev here uh the canadian elections are in two weeks hard to believe isn't

00:05.920 --> 00:10.640
it we're almost there my personal prediction just uh just off the bat is that trudo is probably

00:10.640 --> 00:14.960
going to get a minority government i hate to say it but i think it's true not because of his

00:14.960 --> 00:20.080
strengths he's been a pretty terrible prime minister all things considered however his his

00:20.080 --> 00:24.560
opponents aren't really that strong and to be frank that's why he won his first election it

00:24.560 --> 00:27.840
wasn't because of his own strengths it was because of his father's good name and the fact that all of

00:27.840 --> 00:33.360
his opponents were were quite weak but the elections in two weeks and last night was the

00:33.360 --> 00:40.560
first and only english debate believe it or not there was an informal debate back in september but

00:40.560 --> 00:47.040
trudo actually opted not to go he he refused the other leaders debated without him and in fact

00:47.040 --> 00:53.040
i think to uh to showcase the point they left his podium empty on stage but we've got an

00:53.040 --> 00:57.040
english-speaking debate that happened last night and we've got a french debate uh later in the week

00:57.040 --> 01:02.400
that i'm not going to watch because screw that honestly french is kind of a joke language here

01:02.400 --> 01:06.800
in canada they force a lot of us to learn it in schools and then we instantly purge those memories

01:06.800 --> 01:10.480
from our brain the minute we graduate for the most part and i don't mean to poison the well here or

01:10.480 --> 01:15.680
anything but having seen the debate it's it's my opinion that trudo didn't do very well and i would

01:15.680 --> 01:23.680
like to showcase why so everyone get your uh your 4chan poll 2019 canadian election general debate

01:23.680 --> 01:29.440
bingo cards ready and we're gonna see how many of these things we can tick off that's that's

01:29.440 --> 01:33.760
some incredible artwork by the way i always love these things many canadians have felt the

01:33.760 --> 01:39.920
implications of a divided world more so than 2015 from u.s protectionism to brexit to our growing

01:39.920 --> 01:45.040
tensions with china as prime minister how would you effectively defend both the interests and

01:45.040 --> 01:49.760
values of canadians on the world stage we know we live in a very challenging time right now from

01:49.760 --> 01:53.280
protectionism to fear-based politics to the transformative technological change people are

01:53.280 --> 01:56.800
facing we need to make sure that canadians are equipped and tooled to be able to succeed in an

01:56.800 --> 02:00.320
uncertain world and that's why over the past four years we've invested directly in canadians help

02:00.320 --> 02:03.440
people be optimistic about their future have the tools to succeed and the tools to see their kids

02:03.440 --> 02:07.200
succeed we know the environment is a massive and pressing challenge and building a stronger economy

02:07.200 --> 02:09.840
for the future means protecting the environment for the future as well these are the things we're

02:09.840 --> 02:13.840
going to be talking about tonight this is something that you'll notice about trudeau

02:13.840 --> 02:19.760
throughout this entire night he doesn't really bring up much in the way of concrete numbers

02:19.760 --> 02:25.920
a few times he does and other candidates do a little bit more than he does but he is just a

02:25.920 --> 02:31.280
walking talking point he's basically playing from the same handbook that he did five years ago

02:31.840 --> 02:36.880
and that's not going to work this time in my opinion because he's now had five years of

02:36.880 --> 02:43.520
government at least five years ago it was him outlining his his general values and then us

02:43.520 --> 02:48.320
voting on them and saying okay maybe you know those values will translate into some kind of

02:48.320 --> 02:52.880
concrete action down the road but he hasn't done most of the things he said he would do

02:52.880 --> 02:58.160
during that first campaign and in this debate you'll notice he offers no excuse as to why those

02:58.160 --> 03:03.120
things haven't been done and now with five years of government under your belt justin you can't

03:03.120 --> 03:08.080
rely solely on values anymore because nothing's come of them but as you watch this you'll see

03:08.080 --> 03:12.880
that's how almost all of his answers are framed a lot of talking points and a lot of dodging

03:12.880 --> 03:18.240
questions about specifics we are the people's party and we put canada first the other leaders

03:18.240 --> 03:24.240
on this stage are globalists they spend your money to buy this as u.n security council and also they

03:24.240 --> 03:28.800
are giving your money to other countries to fight climate change in asia and build roads in africa

03:28.800 --> 03:34.800
the u.n is a dysfunctional organization and we must be able to fight for our country actually

03:34.800 --> 03:39.040
we are the only party that will have foreign policies that is based on our security and

03:39.040 --> 03:45.920
prosperity for our country holy shit so i guess this is why this guy has kind of become a meme

03:45.920 --> 03:55.440
in canada and elsewhere you you open the debate your first words by saying that everyone's a

03:55.440 --> 04:03.680
globalist and the u.n is a corrupt organization i mean he's he's not wrong but holy shit

04:05.200 --> 04:09.840
this guy is for those of you who don't know this is maxime bernier he's trying to position himself

04:09.840 --> 04:15.920
as like the outsider conservative candidate he was a member of the conservatives for quite a long

04:15.920 --> 04:20.720
time and he left to start his own party called the people's party which is in my opinion not not

04:20.720 --> 04:25.280
a very good name it doesn't really ring conservatism at all it rings communism but it's not a

04:25.280 --> 04:30.560
communist party um he left to start his own party because he viewed the conservatives as too corrupt

04:30.560 --> 04:35.840
to be able to be fixed and he wanted to take his uh his connections and his clout elsewhere and

04:35.840 --> 04:40.960
since then he's been trying to to to position himself as the the alt conservative i don't know

04:40.960 --> 04:45.680
how it is in the rest of the world but in canada conservatism has been definitely branded with um

04:45.680 --> 04:51.440
the stain of religious fundamentalism and he's trying to go with like the secular conservative

04:51.440 --> 04:56.320
option kind of like donald trump in a sense but he's not as uh as bombastic as trump is almost

04:56.320 --> 05:00.800
almost like the libertarian option in a sense where he's he's for small government he's for

05:00.800 --> 05:05.840
devolution of powers he's anti-globalist he's kind of positioning his party to be kind of like the

05:05.840 --> 05:12.400
ukip of of canada if that makes any sense and his remarks in social media are are meme worthy

05:12.400 --> 05:18.800
they're bombastic they go viral regularly and and frankly it's definitely one of those emperor has

05:18.800 --> 05:24.400
no close situations because as you'll see in this debate he doesn't say too much that's unreasonable

05:24.400 --> 05:29.040
and yet he's branded as like a white supremacist it's kind of unreal to watch to me leadership is

05:29.040 --> 05:32.960
about who you're fighting for the choices you make and whether you're doing what's right for people

05:32.960 --> 05:36.640
and whether it comes to international affairs standing up to trump making sure we fight to build

05:36.640 --> 05:39.440
a better trade agreements that actually put canadians first for me the question really comes

05:39.440 --> 05:43.440
down to do you have the courage to stand up to the powerful and wealthy interests the corporations

05:43.440 --> 05:47.120
that are having too much influence over canada and i've seen so far in ottawa whether it's liberal

05:47.120 --> 05:49.760
conservative governments they haven't had the courage to stand up and fight for people we're

05:49.760 --> 05:53.120
different we're in it for you i don't work for the rich and powerful i work for people this is

05:53.120 --> 05:59.120
the ndp candidate uh jagmeet singh the ndp is they were born out of the canadian communist party back

05:59.120 --> 06:03.760
in i think the 60s or the 70s they they reformed themselves and became the new democrats they're

06:03.760 --> 06:10.240
basically canada's equivalent of i guess the lib dems they're hard left very hard left definitely

06:10.240 --> 06:16.160
socialist definitely full of social justice warriors in a sense and although jagmeet is

06:16.160 --> 06:22.400
kind of down to earth in a lot of ways um there are also just ways where he he operates an

06:22.400 --> 06:27.840
ideology he doesn't explain much regarding uh how he's going to do the things that he wants to do

06:27.840 --> 06:32.400
he talks about standing up to trump which is quite honestly he just shoved that in there because it

06:32.400 --> 06:37.760
was a virtue signal he talks a lot in this debate about um you know expanding various social

06:37.760 --> 06:41.200
programs but he never actually talks about how he's going to pay for it he talks about taxing

06:41.200 --> 06:45.120
the one percent he never actually talks about what happens when the one percent leave canada

06:45.120 --> 06:49.440
because canada's not the united states you know a lot of the richest people in the united states

06:49.440 --> 06:54.240
and a lot of the biggest corporations still might not leave the u.s even if they got more heavily

06:54.240 --> 06:59.040
taxed because they're a massive market canada isn't that there is very little that someone

06:59.040 --> 07:05.360
like jagmeet can do to prevent capital flight from happening to canada so i just don't think

07:05.360 --> 07:09.920
he understands how delicately he has to tiptoe around the situation he thinks he can just

07:09.920 --> 07:13.520
bulldoze in with state force it's not going to work like that of course i will always stand up

07:13.520 --> 07:16.640
for canada and canadian's interests and promote free trade and defend our interests all around the

07:16.640 --> 07:20.800
world but justin trudeau only pretends to stand up for canada you know he's very good at pretending

07:20.800 --> 07:24.480
things he can't even remember how many times he put blackface on because the fact of the matter is

07:24.480 --> 07:28.080
he's always wearing a mask he puts on a reconciliation mask and then fires the attorney

07:28.080 --> 07:32.080
general the first one of indigenous background he puts on a feminist mask and then fires two strong

07:32.080 --> 07:35.760
female MPs for not going along with his corruption he puts on a middle-class mask and then raises

07:35.760 --> 07:39.280
taxes on middle-class canadians mr trudeau you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve

07:39.280 --> 07:49.840
to govern this country holy okay so this is okay andrew shear leader of the tories he's always been

07:49.840 --> 07:54.640
kind of a milquetoast kind of dude and i think this is him trying to break out of that shell

07:54.640 --> 08:00.480
with you know only half success this is supposed to be okay shear i don't know if you know what

08:00.480 --> 08:06.720
this this these 45 seconds are for you to outline your platform not just a shit on trudeau i mean i

08:06.720 --> 08:13.040
enjoyed it but i think you might i think you might have squandered your opportunity also that's the

08:13.040 --> 08:18.080
only mention of the blackface it never comes up again judo never responds to it they just kind of

08:18.080 --> 08:21.280
whitewash that shit which i guess is appropriate because that's what you have to do to get that

08:21.280 --> 08:24.400
makeup off hey justin but i want to start by acknowledging that we're on the traditional

08:24.400 --> 08:27.200
territory of the algonquin peoples into them the which canada's role in the world is an

08:27.200 --> 08:30.560
amiable one we have a historic reputation for being an honest broker for being a country that

08:30.560 --> 08:33.760
stands up for multilateralism we have a commitment as a nation to meet the sustainable development

08:33.760 --> 08:37.520
goals which means our future as a world is built on ending poverty and encouraging the education

08:37.520 --> 08:41.360
of women and girls that's a cornerstone on top of that we really need to renegotiate the world trade

08:41.360 --> 08:44.560
organization and make it an organization that promotes climate action we need a world trade

08:44.560 --> 08:48.160
and climate organization we need to support the rule of law and human rights around the world

08:48.160 --> 08:55.520
because we are world leaders there's the greens elizabeth may um she's very popular and she almost

08:55.520 --> 09:01.120
always wins her seat whenever she runs for it but nobody else in her her party has ever won a seat i

09:01.120 --> 09:06.400
think aside from like one or two other times um so the green party despite constantly getting

09:06.400 --> 09:12.960
platformed in these debates is is not much of a political force in canada and her party basically

09:12.960 --> 09:19.040
competes with with space with the ndp because they have very similar policies um in fact they

09:19.040 --> 09:25.120
could probably just merge and be one party frankly it's just that she just wants to run for herself i

09:25.120 --> 09:30.000
guess i don't know i don't quite know i think it's because the greens are more environmentally

09:30.000 --> 09:34.160
focused than the ndp even though the ndp is quite environmentally focused also she is the prime

09:34.160 --> 09:39.520
virtue signaller of the bunch every single time she talks about a location in canada she talks

09:39.520 --> 09:45.840
about the the native people that used to inhabit that location before europeans came over i get the

09:45.840 --> 09:50.400
point i understand but it's not relevant to the debate i think everybody and thank you for having

09:50.400 --> 09:54.880
me on behalf of the block having leadership or showing leadership sometimes mean not making

09:54.880 --> 09:59.520
mistakes and arresting the chief financial financial officer of we might have been a big

09:59.520 --> 10:05.280
mistake for which farmers growing soya or those who import or be might have paid the price when

10:05.280 --> 10:10.880
you're facing a powerful foe like china you don't try to show biceps if you have only tiny biceps

10:10.880 --> 10:15.280
and this is something that has to be learned and we would support somebody with real leadership

10:15.280 --> 10:22.000
not making mistakes hit the fucking gym trudeau okay this guy is the um leader of the block

10:22.880 --> 10:27.760
the block are the quebec separatists for some reason they always run in the national elections

10:27.760 --> 10:33.760
even though they only run candidates in quebec and they only have interest in quebec politics

10:33.760 --> 10:39.840
and frankly their long-term goal is to have quebec leave canada i have no clue why this guy is here

10:39.840 --> 10:44.720
i don't know why their party keeps getting invited back if they don't want to be part of the national

10:44.720 --> 10:49.360
discussion and frankly i don't really care much about this guy's opinions because he always talks

10:49.360 --> 10:55.120
about quebec rather than canada he always talks about what he'll do for people living in quebec

10:55.120 --> 11:00.320
not for canadians i don't know man mr bernier you like to tweet so let me read some of your

11:00.320 --> 11:05.680
tweets back to you uh you called diversity in canada a cult and extreme multiculturalism

11:05.680 --> 11:10.720
you've used the words ghetto and tribes to describe newcomers whom you say bring distrust

11:10.720 --> 11:15.760
and potential violence on greta tunberg the 16 year old climate change activist you called her

11:15.760 --> 11:20.560
quote clearly mentally unstable are these the words of someone with the character and integrity

11:20.640 --> 11:27.680
to lead all canadians and represent us on the world stage oh yeah okay okay

11:29.520 --> 11:33.120
the question you must tell the truth to canadians if you want to be the leader of this country

11:33.120 --> 11:37.520
and what i'm saying about extreme multiculturalism it is not the way to build this country yes this

11:37.520 --> 11:41.360
country is a diverse country and we must be proud of that but we don't need the legislation like the

11:41.360 --> 11:45.600
multiculturalism act to tell us who we are we are a diverse country and we are proud of that what i'm

11:45.600 --> 11:48.800
saying because it's in line with the immigration i'm saying that we must have fewer immigrants in

11:48.800 --> 11:52.800
this country to be sure for these people to participate in our society so it is a great

11:52.800 --> 11:56.480
country but it's time to have a discussion about the immigration we don't want our country to be

11:56.480 --> 12:00.160
like other countries in europe where they have a huge difficulty to integrate their immigrants and

12:00.160 --> 12:03.680
i'm a proud canadians and that's why i love this country and i'm the only leader on this stage who

12:03.680 --> 12:08.640
wants to have a discussion about the level of immigration completely reasonable there's nothing

12:08.640 --> 12:14.000
in that statement that was inflammatory simply having a concern about about integration does

12:14.000 --> 12:18.560
not make you a racist or a white supremacist wanting a cap on immigration so that you may

12:19.120 --> 12:24.880
preserve the unique culture of the host country is not unreasonable and he's right when he says

12:24.880 --> 12:28.480
that nobody up there wants to actually have a discussion about this issue the conservatives

12:28.480 --> 12:32.640
and the liberals are fine with open borders because that gives big business an underclass

12:32.640 --> 12:38.080
from which to draw cheap labor the greens and the ndp are fine with open borders for for ideological

12:38.080 --> 12:43.200
reasons maxime bernier is the only person who's saying slow immigration i mean trudeau wants

12:43.200 --> 12:49.840
350 000 immigrants to canada a year that's wild and i've got an upcoming video on trudeau that

12:49.840 --> 12:53.680
i'll put out probably at the end of the week or something where um where i discuss some of the

12:53.680 --> 12:59.200
stuff in more in more detail but trudeau has also said that canada is a nation with no identity

12:59.200 --> 13:03.840
which is complete bullshit it's complete bs and and there's not much in the world that actually

13:03.840 --> 13:09.600
offends me but that's pretty offensive justin the reason that i side with maxime bernier on this

13:09.600 --> 13:14.880
issue is because he seems to be the only actual political leader who wants to see the the

13:14.880 --> 13:19.600
preservation of canadian values and canadian culture i mean mr bernie after hearing what was

13:19.600 --> 13:22.080
just said you could have just said hey man i messed up because those are pretty horrible

13:22.080 --> 13:27.680
tweets that you made and those aren't horrible dude jagmeet those aren't horrible tweets those

13:27.680 --> 13:34.240
are completely reasonable jagmeet you're a sikh your religion was founded as a reaction

13:34.240 --> 13:39.280
to muslims attacking your people and you're going to sit here and talk about how multiculturalism

13:39.280 --> 13:44.240
is good you can say that because you're a sikh because the sikh community has integrated into

13:44.240 --> 13:50.480
the commonwealth very nicely and you actually respect human rights but the islamists the people

13:50.480 --> 13:56.960
who would impose sharia on you and i jagmeet they don't respect those values and you can't simply

13:56.960 --> 14:02.160
say that all people are the same because that's just they're just not and it's not a race thing

14:02.160 --> 14:07.120
man it's not a racist thing it's not a bigoted thing it's an ideology thing all people are

14:07.120 --> 14:12.480
compatible with canada but not all ideologies are compatible with the canadian values that's what

14:12.480 --> 14:17.200
this boils down to and you are too cowardly to say that really for me i mean should come as no

14:17.200 --> 14:20.400
surprise to you i believe a leader is not someone who tries to divide people or to pit people

14:20.400 --> 14:23.600
against each other a true leader someone tries to find bridges bringing people together that's what

14:23.600 --> 14:27.120
a leader does and a leader works for the people who need help not helping those at the very top

14:27.120 --> 14:29.760
which we've seen with governments in ottawa for far too long they've been working to make life

14:29.760 --> 14:33.280
easier for the multi-billionaires they get massive corporate tax cuts billions of dollars go towards

14:33.280 --> 14:37.040
them we see offshore tax havens continue this is not the way to build the country the way to build

14:37.040 --> 14:43.840
the future is completely unrelated jagmeet this is not the conversation the conversation is

14:43.840 --> 14:50.480
multiculturalism you can't just swing it back around to to your talking points of of basically

14:50.480 --> 14:54.640
communism i find the things that maxine bernier has said to be completely appalling and he knows

14:54.640 --> 14:57.120
that i feel that way about the things he says in the house we used to sit together and generally

14:57.120 --> 15:00.960
when he said anything i'd have to put my head in my hands because it was so horrific i appreciate

15:00.960 --> 15:04.640
you but you know i don't share your policies i don't share your socialist policies because you

15:04.640 --> 15:08.320
know we won't be able to create any wealth with your policies you have the same kind of policies

15:08.320 --> 15:15.520
than socialist countries like venezuela that won't and see it's he's he's right you know he

15:15.520 --> 15:20.720
if you turn if you turn the government's attention toward the redistribution of wealth you don't

15:20.720 --> 15:25.440
generate any new wealth you might be able to equalize the the amount of wealth that exists

15:25.440 --> 15:30.000
the amount of value that currently exists in the nation but no one's going to be inclined to create

15:30.000 --> 15:36.240
new value and yes value is not a zero-sum game people can create it through their own hard work

15:36.240 --> 15:40.400
that's why people on the far left can never answer the question what do you do when you

15:40.400 --> 15:44.080
run out of other people's money because those people now that they've had they've had all

15:44.080 --> 15:47.840
their all their money taken from them they're not going to want to keep working are they going to

15:47.840 --> 15:51.200
keep running their business and just to have the government steal it from them no they're going to

15:51.200 --> 15:56.640
leave and i think more importantly the the things that maxine bernia has said uh they're not really

15:56.640 --> 16:02.400
that appalling they're they're quite normal extreme multiculturalism has failed pretty much

16:02.400 --> 16:06.720
everywhere i don't know why this is such poison to say but you have to have integration they're

16:06.720 --> 16:12.080
acting like he's he's this pariah for even suggesting the fact that people move to canada

16:12.080 --> 16:18.560
to become canadians what the hell man immigration is not that much a matter of number it's a matter

16:18.560 --> 16:22.800
of resources we invest in it in order to have those persons welcome as well in canada as they

16:22.800 --> 16:27.760
are in quebec with our desire for them to share our language to share some of our values and if

16:27.760 --> 16:33.120
we do have enough resources invested in that this is workable and you do not do it by saying or

16:33.120 --> 16:38.000
sending the message that they are not welcome the block's always been a little bit hard to pin down

16:38.000 --> 16:43.520
on the basic uh on the traditional political spectrum because in some ways they are very very

16:43.520 --> 16:48.800
left and in some ways they're very very right they're very left socially however when it comes

16:48.800 --> 16:54.480
to to quebec sovereignty they're very very right they want their language their culture to be

16:54.480 --> 16:59.360
to be protected and paramount at the same time you'll notice this guy again said quebec and

16:59.360 --> 17:04.880
canada as if they are separate things he has an adversarial relationship with the nation that he

17:04.880 --> 17:11.360
is a part of which is why i consider him to be a joke everybody's will come in this country and

17:11.360 --> 17:15.360
you know 49 of our population believe that we must have fewer immigrants they are not racist

17:15.360 --> 17:18.480
they're not radical so what you are saying because i'm in line with the majority of our

17:18.480 --> 17:21.760
population that i'm supposed to be a radical we have the right we have the right in this

17:25.600 --> 17:30.560
absolutely and we are proud we are proud canadians see there you go half of people

17:30.560 --> 17:36.880
in canada do not want more immigrants and his reply is we're all immigrants you know

17:36.880 --> 17:41.520
technically true the people that were here you know 600 years ago were native people not

17:41.520 --> 17:47.200
not european people i get the argument but we have come to accept that colonization's not a

17:47.200 --> 17:52.800
good thing i mean we can't do anything about it now it would be a great injustice to remove all

17:52.800 --> 17:57.280
white people from north america now but just because we did one horrible thing in the past

17:57.280 --> 18:01.280
does that mean that we should keep letting it happen should we allow colonies of non-integrative

18:01.280 --> 18:05.680
people to come into canada and just fuck the nation up is that what we should do is that

18:05.680 --> 18:10.400
the argument here and no the half of canadians who don't want any more immigration they're not

18:10.400 --> 18:14.720
racist for wanting that he's not a racist for putting forward that idea i think it's important

18:14.720 --> 18:18.400
to recognize we're in a world right now where these discussions this polarization this fear

18:18.400 --> 18:22.320
of the other has become easy currency for politicians who do want to strike up uncertainty

18:22.320 --> 18:25.120
in people's hearts and lift those anxieties and try to get people to vote against things

18:25.120 --> 18:29.040
unfortunately mr bernier on this stage is playing that role of trying to uh to make people more

18:29.040 --> 18:32.080
fearful about the migrations that are happening in the world and the opportunities around

18:32.080 --> 18:35.680
globalization and our ability to continue to redefine every single day what it is to be

18:35.680 --> 18:41.360
canadian listen to this fucking guy just listen just listen migration around the world just seems

18:41.360 --> 18:45.840
to be a a good thing for him and if you're afraid of it well then you're just being fear-mongered by

18:45.840 --> 18:50.240
some kind of racist leader or maybe you're a racist yourself who knows globalization's uh

18:50.240 --> 18:56.000
a great thing it's a goal you know take take the power centers away from local people and put it on

18:56.000 --> 19:00.400
a different continent or in a different country or something somewhere far enough that that regular

19:00.400 --> 19:04.720
people just can't do anything about it that's a great thing isn't it trudeau and if you object

19:04.720 --> 19:10.480
to any of this you're just you're just fearful ignorant small-minded it's such bs you must

19:10.480 --> 19:14.240
celebrate who we are and i'm proud canadian like you and you know we build this country together

19:14.240 --> 19:17.520
and we want this country to be like that in 25 years we love this country and it's not because

19:17.520 --> 19:25.200
i want to have a discussion about immigration publicly what mr shear thinks privately so that

19:25.200 --> 19:33.120
line went viral that maxime bernier only exists to to push the more radical elements of conservatism

19:33.120 --> 19:39.040
that andrew shear can't actually speak into the public limelight um i don't think that's the case

19:39.040 --> 19:44.160
i don't think that he's you know uh paid opposition or anything like that i think maxime bernie is a

19:44.160 --> 19:49.520
patriot who wants to see canada as it currently exists uh continue meanwhile justin shiro talks

19:49.520 --> 19:54.400
about redefining what it is to be canadian you know what it is to be canadian is pretty well

19:54.400 --> 19:59.120
defined all right and i don't agree with some of those definitions but i get it all right there's

19:59.120 --> 20:03.520
there's english and french in my opinion there should be probably ojibwe as as a third language

20:03.520 --> 20:07.440
we have history with the native people here some very bad history with the native people here let's

20:07.440 --> 20:12.640
be honest at the same time there's obviously a lot of good about canada as it currently stands

20:12.640 --> 20:16.000
there's obviously a lot of good things that we do there's a lot of good things that we have that

20:16.000 --> 20:20.960
we've created a lot of good that we've built up here we don't need to redefine canada to to the

20:20.960 --> 20:26.240
point that suddenly people who are completely against our values can be considered canadian

20:26.240 --> 20:31.040
no they can't i'll just be honest here and if this makes me a radical or something so be it if

20:31.040 --> 20:36.160
you have a a muslim immigrant who wants to implement sharia law in canada i don't consider

20:36.160 --> 20:41.120
them canadian i don't consider them part of canadian values i don't think we should redefine

20:41.120 --> 20:47.040
ourselves to include them as part of who we are they are antithetical to who we are i will respect

20:47.040 --> 20:50.880
the constitution i will respect provinces and that's very important and i won't interfere in

20:50.880 --> 20:54.960
provincial jurisdiction i want to interfere in health care because it is a provincial jurisdiction

20:54.960 --> 20:58.640
and you know we cannot in ottawa solve the challenges that we're having for health care

20:58.640 --> 21:02.640
and what we can do we can transfer the money to the provinces and what i will do i will let

21:02.640 --> 21:06.480
provinces being able to deal with health care and education that's our constitution will transfer the

21:06.480 --> 21:10.240
gst so provinces will have the money to deal with that and they will be able to answer to your

21:10.240 --> 21:16.080
challenges so there you go devolution of powers do not infringe on on the rights of the provincial

21:16.080 --> 21:20.720
governments to to act in their own domains that seems reasonable to me the new democratic

21:20.720 --> 21:23.920
government we will bring in universal farm maker for all you would use your health card not your

21:23.920 --> 21:27.680
credit card for medication how are you going to pay for it again it never comes up how it's going

21:27.680 --> 21:31.920
to be paid for he he talks about taxing the one percent but he doesn't really know what that

21:31.920 --> 21:36.560
entails or how you have to do it jagmeet operates on pure ideology if you want cooperation with

21:36.560 --> 21:41.200
provinces or quebec you need to respect the jurisdiction and something that you have to

21:41.200 --> 21:46.480
provinces or quebec as if quebec isn't a province fuck you in 10 years of steven harper's government

21:46.480 --> 21:49.680
he chose to stop meeting with premiers and first ministers meetings and we restarted that when we

21:49.680 --> 21:53.680
took office in 2015 we were able to strengthen the cpp for a generation we were able to sign historic

21:53.680 --> 21:57.120
health accords with massive investments in in home care and in mental health we were able to invest

21:57.120 --> 22:00.560
in infrastructure like housing and public transit across the country and we continue to work with

22:00.560 --> 22:05.200
provinces on renegotiating in naphtha that it had everyone playing on one team canada but yes with

22:05.200 --> 22:08.240
certain provinces right now we're fighting on the defining issue of our time because jason kenny and

22:08.240 --> 22:11.840
doug ford and other conservative premiers don't want to do anything on climate change and we need

22:11.840 --> 22:15.600
a government in ottawa that is going to fight them and fight for canadians on climate change and

22:15.600 --> 22:21.360
that's exactly what we're going to do those of you don't know doug ford is he's basically a trump

22:21.360 --> 22:28.880
style candidate that won the ontario premiership and he has become a uh a liberal boogeyman in a

22:28.880 --> 22:33.360
sense now doug ford he's he's not a great politician um frankly he's kind of like he's

22:33.360 --> 22:39.600
kind of a shitbag but he is like trump was a pressure release valve because the previous

22:39.600 --> 22:45.760
premiere had acted so poorly in how they operated that people said you know what we will take the

22:45.760 --> 22:50.960
shitbag over institutional corruption and it was important that doug ford got elected i don't think

22:50.960 --> 22:56.000
he's he's good at his job at all at the very least it was a slap to the left saying that we will take

22:56.000 --> 23:01.680
somebody this bad over you because you're worse you're the worse of the two evils not the better

23:01.680 --> 23:06.320
but more importantly trudeau mentioned uh stephen harper's predecessor he mentions harper a lot

23:06.320 --> 23:09.520
because harper was prime minister for something like 10 years uh something around those lines

23:10.160 --> 23:15.440
and he doesn't actually have much to say about andrew shear he just talks about stephen harper

23:15.440 --> 23:20.720
when he talks about the toys um maybe because i don't know maybe because shear hasn't formed

23:20.720 --> 23:24.320
government yet so you can't really really critique what he would do maybe it's because he wants to

23:24.320 --> 23:31.120
establish some kind of direct link between shear and harper but the truth is harper was only so so

23:31.120 --> 23:35.520
as prime minister he didn't have the best stints as leader of canada but he was better than trudeau

23:35.520 --> 23:40.000
and i think on some level trudeau needs to needs to understand that he's not running against harper

23:40.000 --> 23:45.040
this time the field is different than it was in 2015 you criticized mr harper on his climate

23:45.040 --> 23:48.000
targets but you failed to achieve them you criticized mr harper on the fact that he cut

23:48.000 --> 23:51.920
healthcare funding you also cut them you criticized mr harper and conservatives on giving billions to

23:51.920 --> 23:55.440
billionaires and corporations but you gave 14 billion more the question is this why do you keep

23:55.440 --> 23:59.040
letting down the people that voted for you first thing we did was cut taxes for the middle class

23:59.040 --> 24:02.240
and raise them for the wealthiest one percent and on climate change after 10 years of stephen

24:02.240 --> 24:06.000
harper doing nothing in just four years we've reached three quarters of the way to our 2030

24:06.000 --> 24:09.680
targets which we will meet and surpass but we know that's not enough we're going to continue to do

24:09.680 --> 24:13.520
more like planting 2 billion trees like moving forward on giving money up front so people can

24:13.520 --> 24:18.320
retrofit their homes on making canada net zero by 2050 we know how important it is to move forward

24:18.320 --> 24:22.880
and right now mr shear has promised that the first thing he would do is rip up the only real plan to

24:22.880 --> 24:25.760
fight climate change that canada has ever had these are the things we're going to be moving

24:25.760 --> 24:29.520
forward on because canadians expect us to we lifted 900 000 people out of poverty with our

24:29.520 --> 24:32.720
investments in families with the canada child benefit and things that actually mr shear and

24:32.720 --> 24:36.800
mr singh the ndp voted against another thing that happens throughout the entire debate is that trudeau

24:36.800 --> 24:42.560
he kind of tries to play the middle and he puts on all these different hats so for example when

24:42.560 --> 24:47.120
the people on the left attack him like the ndp and the greens he says no no look at all the

24:47.120 --> 24:51.600
leftist things we've done our way is working and then when people on the right attack him

24:51.600 --> 24:55.360
well he doesn't actually try to play the right at all he just kind of calls them discriminatory

24:55.360 --> 24:59.360
but you know whatever the point is that he's getting hammered from both sides and to some

24:59.360 --> 25:03.280
extent that's kind of accepted because he is the incumbent so everyone's going to try and take pot

25:03.280 --> 25:07.840
shots at him at the same time it really seems like no one is happy with him and there is a lot

25:07.840 --> 25:12.560
of legitimate criticisms to be leveled at him to which he just reverts the talking points as as he

25:12.560 --> 25:17.040
just did in reality statistics canada points out in 2017 the wealthiest actually paid less in tax

25:17.040 --> 25:19.600
and gained more in wealth and when we look at one of the biggest problems that we're faced with as

25:19.600 --> 25:23.280
a country is offshore tax havens now not only did your finance minister use offshore offshore tax

25:23.280 --> 25:26.480
havens but also the president of the treasury boarding she also used offshore tax havens so

25:26.480 --> 25:29.360
how can you tell canadians we don't have the money to fund things like universal pharmacare

25:29.360 --> 25:34.400
when you're talked to cabinet ministers don't pay their fair share see at the very least we can go

25:34.400 --> 25:39.920
to stats can 2017 now if we wanted and look up to see whether or not that figure was true you can in

25:39.920 --> 25:44.400
fact hit up some older news articles and check out the corruption of trudeau's ministers i don't i

25:44.400 --> 25:49.360
don't like jagmeet but at the very least he talks about tangible things rather than talking points

25:49.360 --> 25:54.960
and yeah i have a a basically a trouble with trudeau 2 video coming before the election

25:54.960 --> 25:59.280
describing a lot of his problems and oh boy does he have some problems right now mr trudeau has

25:59.280 --> 26:03.040
not changed the climate targets from those of mr harper it needs to be said very clearly and

26:03.040 --> 26:06.720
i'm so disappointed because i believe the liberals in 2015 that they would go with science-based

26:06.720 --> 26:11.360
evidence-based policies but the target is saying he will hit by 2030 is a target for losing the

26:11.360 --> 26:14.880
fight against climate change because it ignores the science it ignores the ipcc advice on this

26:14.880 --> 26:18.480
stage tonight the green party is the only party with a plan mission possible actually

26:20.160 --> 26:26.640
here's the thing about the environment insofar as canada is concerned canada produces 1.6 percent

26:27.600 --> 26:33.200
of the world's um the world's emissions isn't china like 20 isn't the states like 20 isn't

26:33.200 --> 26:40.320
india like 17 or something i don't have the numbers offhand but talking like if canada

26:40.320 --> 26:45.280
doesn't do something the planet will burst into flames or something is is ridiculous when it

26:45.280 --> 26:50.880
comes to climate change we are small players it's the honest truth i don't think canadians like to

26:50.880 --> 26:56.080
hear that but it's the truth none of these people on the stage frankly even maxime burnier want to

26:56.080 --> 27:01.920
admit this but it's the truth now maxime burnier's argument is is that all of these restrictions

27:01.920 --> 27:05.200
that you have to put to to hit climate change will actually destroy the economy you can hear

27:05.200 --> 27:11.040
you can hear him say it right here see he says destroy the economy and that's because that's

27:11.040 --> 27:17.920
because they will so here we are we have leaders who want to wreck canada's economy to try and meet

27:17.920 --> 27:23.920
their quotas in climate change however canada's output is so small that even meeting those quotas

27:24.560 --> 27:28.960
won't have much long-term impact of the plans that are forward here on the stage there's only

27:28.960 --> 27:32.400
one plan that the experts is qualified as both ambitious and doable and that is the plan that

27:32.400 --> 27:36.800
we have begun to put in place mr trudeau's plan is failing it is making everything more expensive

27:36.800 --> 27:40.000
for hard-working canyons and he has granted a massive exemption to the country's largest

27:40.000 --> 27:43.840
emitters our plan takes the climate change fight global recognizing that canada can do more to

27:43.840 --> 27:46.800
fight climate change by exporting our clean technology and helping other countries lower

27:48.480 --> 27:54.400
see there you go helping other countries lower their emissions and export clean technology

27:54.400 --> 28:00.480
boom sounds decent to me i don't know why this guy's getting maligned for for this but it sounds

28:00.480 --> 28:04.080
good to me your campaign is about courage but you have not shown the courage to fight kibex

28:04.080 --> 28:07.680
discriminatory law it bars individuals who like yourself wear religious symbols from some

28:07.680 --> 28:11.440
provincial employment if you were prime minister would you stand back and allow another province

28:11.440 --> 28:15.440
to discriminate against its citizens aren't you and frankly the other leaders on the stage putting

28:15.440 --> 28:19.920
your own party's interests in quebec ahead of your principles and equality rights of all citizens you

28:19.920 --> 28:23.120
have a minute to answer sure uh it's probably pretty obvious to folks that i am obviously

28:23.120 --> 28:28.800
against bill 21 it is something that hurts me bill 21 by the way it it uh it basically means that you

28:28.800 --> 28:35.280
can't wear religious um religious iconography if you're working for the government in quebec so no

28:35.280 --> 28:41.360
crucifixes no turbans no hijabs or i guess anything else that you would wear i guess like yarmulkes

28:41.360 --> 28:46.560
or anything it they basically want to enforce a secular state i don't like the idea of that

28:46.560 --> 28:52.160
because you know um individuality human rights restricting that stuff might be the lesser of two

28:52.160 --> 28:57.520
evils if if integration if a lack of integration is getting that bad i think about all the times i

28:57.520 --> 28:59.920
grew up being told that i couldn't do things because the way i looked i think about all the

28:59.920 --> 29:02.960
people in canada that grow up being told they can't achieve more because of their identity or

29:02.960 --> 29:09.120
who they are i think about who says that i have not met a single canadian outside of the oldest

29:09.120 --> 29:15.600
hillbillies who say shit like that anymore i think that attitude's gone i think even among like more

29:15.600 --> 29:20.400
conservative people that attitude's gone people in quebec right now that are being told just because

29:20.400 --> 29:23.440
they wear hijab that they can't be a teacher or if they wear yarmulke they can't be a judge and

29:23.440 --> 29:26.880
that's hurtful it's wrong and it probably comes as no surprise that i'm opposed to laws that divide

29:26.880 --> 29:30.560
people what i do every single day when i go to quebec is i say hey i'm here i'm someone that believes

29:30.560 --> 29:33.520
in fighting climate the flight fighting the climate crisis i'm something that believes in

29:33.520 --> 29:36.640
firmly and unequivocally the rights of women the right of women to choose and to build more access

29:36.640 --> 29:40.160
to abortion services i believe firmly in making sure we tackle the powerful corporations that are

29:40.160 --> 29:44.160
that are influencing government and that are not allowing other none of this is related it's

29:44.160 --> 29:48.320
talking points i believe it's very important for for people to understand that well we will not

29:48.320 --> 29:51.280
intervene in this court case as a conservative government we do recognize and the conservative

29:51.280 --> 29:54.880
party always stands for freedom and equality and individual liberty and we will make sure that this

29:54.880 --> 29:58.160
does we will not pursue this type of bill i appreciate that i want to touch on one of the

29:58.160 --> 30:03.440
themes of this discussion here's what's interesting um he said that his government will not interfere

30:04.080 --> 30:08.080
in the province's right to pass this bill but he would not introduce it federally

30:08.080 --> 30:12.880
i think that's important you can disagree with something and still not take legal action against

30:12.880 --> 30:19.200
it and that is in fact part of the devolution of powers um it's not simply using the government as

30:19.200 --> 30:25.120
a hammer to bludgeon everyone and everything in your path and i think the right both the tories

30:25.120 --> 30:29.840
and and the people's party understand this a bit more than the left does we all have done through

30:29.840 --> 30:36.080
this rather strange period of an election campaign confronting issues of of of privilege and anyone

30:36.080 --> 30:41.760
with white skin has privilege but when we look at bill 21 in quebec oh god with 70 of the population

30:41.760 --> 30:45.200
of quebec supporting the bill 21 and 70 of the members of parliament in quebec supporting bill

30:45.200 --> 30:51.920
21 it's not only a polarization issue in quebec see this is where this guy's um quebec not canada

30:51.920 --> 30:56.560
attitude kind of serves him even though i still think it's it's kind of stupid in this context

30:56.560 --> 31:02.960
but he says hey where i'm from it's not a polarizing issue 70 of people in quebec want

31:02.960 --> 31:09.600
this bill so even though the block does sometimes promote socialist policies they're also very much

31:09.600 --> 31:13.760
for the devolution of powers it's like i said they're hard to pin down on the spectrum but i

31:13.760 --> 31:20.160
do know that being like a quebec only party in a canadian national election is just ridiculous on

31:20.160 --> 31:26.640
the face of it it's kind of like the um the the scottish national party who who run in the uk's

31:26.640 --> 31:29.280
elections like they're never going to form a government because they're only interested in

31:29.280 --> 31:32.480
scotland interesting you have spoken very eloquently about discrimination and fought

31:32.480 --> 31:36.320
against it all your life um and that's why it's so surprising to have heard you say like every

31:36.320 --> 31:40.640
other leader on the stage the federal government under you would not intervene in the question of

31:40.640 --> 31:45.680
bill 21 in quebec it's a question where yes it's awkward politically because as mr blanchette says

31:45.680 --> 31:49.600
it is very popular but i'm the only one on the stage who has said yes a federal government might

31:49.600 --> 31:52.720
have to intervene on this because the federal government needs to protect minority rights needs

31:52.720 --> 31:56.880
to protect language rights needs to protect women's rights and needs to do that right across the

31:56.880 --> 32:01.440
federal government needs to be a hammer it's like i said he doesn't understand that you can't simply

32:01.440 --> 32:07.200
use the powers of the government to bludgeon your way into everything you didn't say that you would

32:07.200 --> 32:10.320
possibly intervene you didn't even leave the door open and that's not let's be honest for a second

32:10.320 --> 32:14.080
here every single day of my life is fighting a bill like bill 21 so every single day of my life

32:14.080 --> 32:16.800
if you form government every single day of my life is challenging people who think that you

32:16.800 --> 32:22.080
can't do things because the way you look every man you you are one of the most privileged people

32:22.080 --> 32:28.480
in canada you're on a national stage with the leaders of other parties you are the leader of

32:28.480 --> 32:35.360
a prominent party yourself and you're talking about every single day is is is fighting this kind

32:35.360 --> 32:41.760
of oppression like are you kidding me you know i i get it brown skin turban beard some people are

32:41.760 --> 32:46.400
going to look at you funny some people might might might throw a slur at you it shouldn't

32:46.400 --> 32:52.560
happen it's disgusting i understand to act like that you are not the height of privilege despite

32:52.560 --> 32:58.240
those things is quite frankly ridiculous about the bill 21 we must respect the constitution and

32:58.240 --> 33:02.000
we won't interfere at the federal level that's the decision from the from the provincial government

33:02.000 --> 33:06.960
and that's what we must do but also mr thing you said that you didn't want boom respect the

33:06.960 --> 33:12.720
constitution don't interfere with the provinces at the federal level great i mean again i don't

33:12.720 --> 33:18.640
really agree with with bill 21 either but that's the right answer for a federal leader that is the

33:18.640 --> 33:23.280
right answer so you're for diversity but what about diversity of opinions i have the right

33:23.280 --> 33:27.040
to have another opinion about immigration and i don't know why you're not you you're a leader

33:27.040 --> 33:30.880
and you must be try to have everybody on your side but are you believing let me answer that

33:30.880 --> 33:33.840
question are you going to be free speech only when people are saying things that you want to

33:33.920 --> 33:37.280
here you're asking the part let me answer it after a couple minutes of this debate tonight i think

33:37.280 --> 33:40.160
people can clearly see why i didn't think you should deserve a platform the comments that

33:40.160 --> 33:42.880
you're making the type of things you say there's one thing to say that you disagree with somebody

33:42.880 --> 33:47.920
that's fine but when you incite hatred no i don't it's not you cannot say that i just want to ask

33:47.920 --> 33:51.360
about her mental stability it shows a lack of judgment you don't deserve a platform and i'm

33:51.360 --> 33:55.120
happy to challenge you on that because your your ideas are hurtful to canada i will always work to

33:55.120 --> 34:01.120
build unity and bring people together holy shit okay so because uh because maxime bernia talks

34:01.120 --> 34:04.880
about living immigration because he talks about the negative effects of extreme multiculturalism

34:04.880 --> 34:08.640
because he talks about the problems of non-integrative immigrants into canada

34:09.200 --> 34:15.120
he's he's hurtful he hurts canada are you are you crazy there was there was a great debate on

34:15.120 --> 34:19.600
whether or not to even invite maxime bernier and jagmeet's position is that he shouldn't have been

34:19.600 --> 34:25.200
there there's no there's no reason to hold that position i mean let's say his ideas are as bad

34:25.200 --> 34:30.000
as you think they are jagmeet surely you would be able to absolutely destroy them in a debate

34:30.560 --> 34:35.520
you haven't this is a debate you can do it but you haven't you've just said that he's hurtful

34:35.520 --> 34:40.720
you don't stop extremism by isolating it when you isolate it it goes into an echo chamber and

34:40.720 --> 34:47.280
festers you stop it by debating it and showing other people who are watching the debate how

34:47.280 --> 34:53.280
right you are and how wrong they are you're not willing to do this with maxime bernier because

34:53.280 --> 35:00.240
you know that he would wipe the floor with you if you actually got down to comparing ideologies

35:00.240 --> 35:04.640
and the effects of immigration you don't want to have that discussion which is why you didn't

35:04.640 --> 35:10.960
want him at the debate in my opinion jagmeet you're a coward what is very dangerous is when

35:10.960 --> 35:15.040
you have a prime minister like justin trudeau who uses legitimate issues like racism and hateful

35:15.600 --> 35:19.360
hateful language to demonize anyone who disagrees with him calling people uncanadian for disagreeing

35:19.360 --> 35:23.680
with his failure on the border thank you very much i'm sorry i mean he was cut off but he's

35:23.680 --> 35:28.160
also right there are legitimate refugees from middle eastern nations and elsewhere who who

35:28.160 --> 35:33.840
come to canada because they want to be canadian and inviting in the sharia types is only going to

35:33.840 --> 35:41.120
make life harder for them not not easier they came here to escape the barbarism of their home country

35:41.120 --> 35:46.320
we don't want to import that same barbarism thanks page and hey to ubc thank you i raise

35:46.320 --> 35:51.120
my hands to musqueam swamish and slave with his territory see see it's all about who used to live

35:51.120 --> 35:55.040
there we need fair voting we need to get rid of first past the post because it creates each

35:55.040 --> 36:00.240
political party as rival warring camps even when the elections are over oh first past the post you

36:00.240 --> 36:04.720
know uh justin trudeau ran on on getting rid of that and then he later turned around and said

36:04.720 --> 36:09.520
that he wasn't going to do it remember that i did a video on it remember that it's really important

36:09.520 --> 36:13.360
to recognize that yes we're in a time of polarization and differences that get highlighted

36:13.360 --> 36:16.480
by the kind of debate going on at this stage and in this campaign about how we're moving forward

36:16.480 --> 36:20.080
the reality is canadians agree on most things we want to raise our kids in that world that

36:20.080 --> 36:22.480
is getting better for them we want to be able to pay for their future their futures we want

36:22.480 --> 36:25.920
to be able to retire in in comfort we want to create opportunities for our neighbors as well

36:25.920 --> 36:29.040
this is something that binds canadians together right around the country and the fact that there

36:29.040 --> 36:32.880
is a politics of fear and division that is continuing to dominate here uh underlies uh

36:32.880 --> 36:36.960
what we're actually doing thank you very much it's it's not politics of fear and division

36:36.960 --> 36:42.400
because those things that you mentioned justin that all canadians want and i agree i think most

36:42.400 --> 36:49.120
canadians want those things um you can't do that with open borders the welfare state cannot support

36:49.120 --> 36:54.240
hundreds of thousands of immigrants flooding in and taking out from a system they didn't pay into

36:54.800 --> 36:58.960
it's just it's just the it's just the math of it we are a successful country but we are not

36:58.960 --> 37:04.000
successful enough that we can support the entire world's poor and i'm not a racist for saying that

37:04.960 --> 37:09.360
it's it's just the numbers it's the truth speaking about immigration it is not polarization

37:09.360 --> 37:15.440
actually canada receive more more immigrants per capita than any other western countries three

37:15.440 --> 37:19.600
times higher than the u.s so we must have a discussion about that it is the equivalent of

37:19.600 --> 37:23.920
one nova scotia every three years like the population of nova scotia every three years

37:23.920 --> 37:28.320
here in canada so you know they are for mass immigration and for a sustainable immigration

37:28.320 --> 37:32.560
and that's why we must have fewer immigrants a maximum of 150 000 a year with more economic

37:32.560 --> 37:36.720
immigrants for our country seems completely reasonable nothing about that was racist he

37:36.720 --> 37:40.800
didn't mention a single race or a single location from where the immigrants are coming from he

37:40.800 --> 37:45.920
didn't even mention a single ideology although in my opinion the the the biggest problem is competing

37:45.920 --> 37:50.720
ideologies incompatible ideologies flooding into canada he just talked about the economic realities

37:50.720 --> 37:55.920
of the numbers and it was a completely reasonable thing to say mr trudeau you broke ethics laws twice

37:55.920 --> 37:59.600
you interfered in an ongoing criminal court proceeding you shut down parliamentary

37:59.600 --> 38:02.720
investigations into your corruption and you fire the only two people in your caucus who

38:02.720 --> 38:06.960
are speaking out against what you're trying to do just for telling the truth tell me when did

38:06.960 --> 38:12.000
you decide that the rules don't apply to you oh this will be something that i bring up in that

38:12.000 --> 38:20.800
video by the way that upcoming video uh trudeau's corruption the snc scandal oh god i i can't go into

38:20.800 --> 38:27.120
it now guys but you will see and i think this might be the thing that at the very least make

38:27.120 --> 38:31.440
ensures that trudeau does not get a majority government this time around mr shear the role

38:31.440 --> 38:34.400
of a prime minister is to stand up for canadian's jobs to stand up for the public interest and that's

38:34.400 --> 38:37.440
what i've done and that's what i will continue to do every single day the way i have worked for

38:37.440 --> 38:40.960
canadians is around investing in them unlike the vision that you're putting forward of giving tax

38:40.960 --> 38:44.720
breaks that help people who are making 400 000 k a year 400 000 a year more than someone making

38:44.720 --> 38:50.080
40 000 a year you're offering a 50 000 tax break which is more money than most canadians earn to

38:50.080 --> 38:53.200
the wealthiest canadians with your plan of course we don't entirely know your plan because you

38:53.200 --> 38:56.560
haven't released your costed platform yet which i think is a disrespect to every Canadian watching

38:57.520 --> 39:01.440
you'll notice that he didn't say a single thing about the corruption or the the court case

39:01.440 --> 39:07.840
currently going on didn't say a single thing pure dodge went completely back to talking points

39:10.480 --> 39:13.280
you looked canadians in the eye and you said that the allegations in the global mail were false you

39:13.280 --> 39:16.640
said jody wilson rayburn never came to you you said you never put pressure on her we now know

39:16.640 --> 39:20.560
that those were all lies you have failed to tell the truth mr shear the responsibility of any prime

39:20.560 --> 39:23.680
minister is to stand up for jobs and what you're saying is you wouldn't have done it the ceo of

39:24.480 --> 39:30.240
you never threatened jobs or headquarters you are making that up again see complete dodge he talks

39:30.240 --> 39:35.840
about specific he talks about specific people in specific publications specific articles talking

39:35.840 --> 39:41.360
about what justin trudeau did the corruption didn't say a single thing about it justin trudeau

39:41.360 --> 39:46.720
will never answer questions about about the snc scandal don't worry i'll talk about it someday

39:46.720 --> 39:49.440
we're gonna save families money by investing in pharmacare for all which is gonna save families

39:49.440 --> 39:55.520
over 500 a month we're gonna invest in child care which is gonna save families thousands of

39:55.520 --> 39:58.160
dollars a month and we're gonna make sure that those families that earn less than 70 000 get

39:58.160 --> 40:02.960
denticare that's gonna save families at least 1240 a month our taxpayers where will you where

40:02.960 --> 40:05.440
will you find the money where will you find the money this is a conservative spin where we're

40:05.440 --> 40:08.480
gonna find the money is this we're gonna ask the wealthiest canadians the wealthiest canadians

40:08.480 --> 40:11.600
those who have wealth of over 20 million dollars those who have fortunes of over 20 million dollars

40:11.600 --> 40:14.960
we're gonna ask them to pay a little more yes how do you prevent them from leaving the country

40:15.920 --> 40:19.600
what if they say hey you know what i'm just going to take my 20 million dollars and go

40:20.400 --> 40:24.720
and if that means that i i shut down a business in canada and bring it to the states or bring

40:24.720 --> 40:31.520
it elsewhere then i'll do that what do you do then what do you do when all the high earners leave

40:31.520 --> 40:34.480
it's the united nations declaration the right for indigenous peoples needs to come into force of law

40:34.480 --> 40:37.760
in this country i know you oppose it because the debate we had at mcclean's but the reality of it

40:37.760 --> 40:40.880
is section 35 of the constitution already requires consultation and it does not boil down to

40:41.440 --> 40:46.080
the thing about the uh the un declaration of the rights of indigenous persons

40:46.800 --> 40:53.760
is that it is it is largely considered unworkable in law the justice minister in 2016 said that

40:53.760 --> 40:57.760
adopting the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples is unworkable

40:58.480 --> 41:01.920
respectfully it is a political distraction to undertaking the hard work required to actually

41:01.920 --> 41:06.080
implement it this un declaration really seems to be something that other uh other leaders

41:06.080 --> 41:11.840
beat the current government with while knowing that it's not something that could actually work

41:11.840 --> 41:15.040
in canadian law so what does free prior and informed consent mean for every single

41:15.040 --> 41:18.480
indigenous community what about the dozens and dozens of indigenous communities who want these

41:18.480 --> 41:21.520
projects why are you prepared to set aside the decision of the human rights tribunal to fight

41:21.520 --> 41:24.720
it in court just as mr trudeau is when they actually found as a matter of fact that our

41:24.720 --> 41:28.400
government committed acts that were reckless and willful in the violation of the rights of

41:28.400 --> 41:32.960
indigenous children there are dozens of well let's be honest um i don't know exactly what she's

41:32.960 --> 41:38.240
referring to here i'll have to look into it later but in general the human rights tribunal in canada

41:38.240 --> 41:45.360
is a joke body they're the tribunal that prevented a guy from tweeting for three years because he

41:45.360 --> 41:50.240
shit posted too hard i don't consider them legitimate i don't think they have any place in canada

41:50.800 --> 41:54.880
you don't fear the idea of expropriating territories going into provinces and saying

41:55.520 --> 42:00.480
the constitution yours not mine the constitution it is your constitution because quebec's part of

42:00.480 --> 42:07.280
canada this this guy's ridiculous man this section is about about land treaties with

42:07.280 --> 42:13.600
canada's first nations not quebec rights that's all that's what he turns it to is just the rights

42:13.600 --> 42:18.720
of of people in quebec says that i have the right to go through provinces through quebec without

42:18.720 --> 42:22.400
their approval and i remind you that's just the beccers and the prime minister said clearly

42:22.400 --> 42:27.040
quebec isn't a prime minister because you're not a country perry belvard the grand chief of the uh

42:27.040 --> 42:30.480
the head of the assembly of first nations has said that no government has done more for indigenous

42:30.480 --> 42:34.000
peoples than this government and he's one of your constituents mr shear that's right he comes from

42:34.000 --> 42:41.360
my little blackberry i have nothing to learn from mr trudeau who fired the first indigenous attorney

42:41.360 --> 42:45.520
general for doing her job she said that she would do politics differently and you fired her when

42:45.520 --> 42:51.440
she did see that's actually uh somewhat unrelated it's still a good point because trudeau did fire

42:51.440 --> 42:56.320
somebody who was looking into into his corruption um at the same time the fact that she's indigenous

42:56.320 --> 43:02.560
doesn't matter and this is just the tories trying to play the left's game of identity politics but

43:02.560 --> 43:06.960
at the same time if that is the game i guess you have to play it nowadays you said that you're

43:06.960 --> 43:10.880
ready for building pipelines all across this country by the private sector but at the same

43:10.880 --> 43:14.960
time you said you know quebecers are ready to buy oil and gas from canada i agree with that i agree

43:14.960 --> 43:19.200
that quebecers know that it's safer to transport oil and gas by pipelines than by trains but at the

43:19.200 --> 43:23.600
same time the quebec government said that there's no social acceptability for a pipeline in quebec

43:23.600 --> 43:26.720
what will be your position on that do you think that you'll be able to use the constitution

43:26.720 --> 43:30.480
because after consultation if we don't have any agreement we must be able to use a constitution

43:30.480 --> 43:33.920
section 9210 to be able to build a pipeline when you do that the federal government will have the

43:33.920 --> 43:36.880
full authority the full jurisdiction to approve pipeline but what you're saying you're for

43:36.880 --> 43:40.800
pipelines but you don't have the courage to use a constitution to be sure that we'll have pipelines

43:40.800 --> 43:44.080
in this country for the unity of our country and the prosperity of our country that's just not the

43:44.080 --> 43:46.800
case at all i've always said that the federal government must stand up for federal jurisdiction

43:46.800 --> 43:50.480
we respect provincial jurisdiction and when you've got the best idea i am convinced that i can get

43:50.480 --> 43:55.280
support for this project because quebecers know that it's better to take energy from western

43:55.280 --> 43:58.160
canada than the tanker after tanker of foreign oil coming up to st lawrence or oil and gas coming

43:58.160 --> 44:00.880
from donald trump's economy i know quebecers will support this project because it will also allow

44:00.880 --> 44:04.000
them to share their hydro electrical power with other provinces as well see despite that little

44:04.000 --> 44:08.800
jab at donald trump in the end when you get the two guys on the right actually talking about

44:08.800 --> 44:14.000
policy it seems like there's a real discussion going on and it's not just mudslinging there was

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
a little bit of mudslinging you know you know uh maxime bernier telling andrew shear that he

44:18.000 --> 44:23.360
he was too cowardly to use the constitution to ensure a pipeline gets built but in general

44:23.360 --> 44:27.280
they're talking about policy and they're talking about specifics of policy and it's kind of

44:27.280 --> 44:31.840
refreshing because it's not just ideology it's not just talking points they're actually talking about

44:31.840 --> 44:36.880
a specific project that has been held up by the liberal government and how they would solve the

44:36.880 --> 44:42.320
situation that's kind of refreshing to be honest even though i don't really agree with either their

44:42.320 --> 44:47.840
solutions at least we're talking about something specific and not just ideals you know i went to

44:48.320 --> 44:51.440
again just recently we've got a community impacted by mercury poisoning an indigenous activist went

44:51.440 --> 44:54.720
to a private fundraiser where mr chuteau mocked that indigenous activist saying thank you for

44:54.720 --> 44:57.760
your donation living with mercury poisoning because he's a fraud what kind of prime minister

44:57.760 --> 45:00.640
does that i wish i had an answer but one that doesn't deserve to be re-elected

45:02.160 --> 45:07.280
oh boy future video it's not a short-term project it is on us as settler canation settler canadians

45:07.280 --> 45:13.520
to bring justice settler canadians that is how the greens at least i'm pretty sure most of the

45:13.520 --> 45:19.280
radical left in canada but the greens at least view white people in canada not as canadians

45:19.920 --> 45:26.720
as settler canadians they're they have to have this distinction where we're the settler canadians

45:26.720 --> 45:32.320
and then the the aboriginals are i guess the the native canadians considering how much

45:32.320 --> 45:40.640
fluff has been given about the politics of of divisiveness in this debate it is ridiculous

45:40.640 --> 45:46.800
to use term like settler canadian i do not view myself as a settler canadian nor will i ever view

45:46.800 --> 45:51.840
myself as a settler canadian i don't accept that label i don't even accept you know uh italian

45:51.840 --> 45:58.320
canadian or or irish canadian or or newfoundlander i'm a canadian and that's that no other leader

45:58.320 --> 46:02.560
is ready to build a new relationship with our first nation they all support the status quo

46:02.560 --> 46:08.560
but the system is broken we still have extreme poverty on reserve we need a bold reform and we

46:08.560 --> 46:13.760
are the only party that will try to implement property rights on reserve and also establish

46:13.760 --> 46:19.200
a new relationship based on self-reliance for these communities we need to build a new system

46:19.200 --> 46:23.280
working with them but that's not what they want because we cannot fix the system right now if we

46:23.280 --> 46:28.080
don't do a bold reform and we are ready for that this is what's interesting about this um those of

46:28.080 --> 46:35.120
you who don't know how the first nations reserve system works in in canada is that all of the the

46:35.120 --> 46:40.960
reserve property is communally owned which means that it's an it's basically owned by by the chiefs

46:41.840 --> 46:47.600
of uh of that nation and and they're just funded by the government and so when a first nations

46:47.600 --> 46:53.040
person lives in a house on a reserve they don't actually own the house they can't they can't sell

46:53.040 --> 46:59.040
the house and you know on service it sounds good free housing great at the same time um

47:00.160 --> 47:04.240
it also means that you don't have any kind of capital to leave you know if you wanted to sell

47:04.240 --> 47:08.720
your house and move off reserve you can't do that because you don't own the house and so it ends up

47:08.720 --> 47:15.280
being the case that like um there's a lot of alcoholism and drug problems on canada's reserves

47:15.280 --> 47:22.400
they are in fact under a lot of uh boil water advisories um the the conditions on them are

47:22.400 --> 47:28.640
appalling and at the same time the people who live there they seem to largely have no desire

47:28.640 --> 47:33.040
to actually help themselves but not only no desire but also no ability to help themselves because

47:33.120 --> 47:37.600
they don't own any property they can't really you know get off the reserve at least some of them do

47:37.600 --> 47:42.960
some of them have you know because there are also um there are also subsidies that come through

47:43.520 --> 47:47.440
the the the the reserve system to allow people to go to school and they pay for part of their

47:47.440 --> 47:52.640
tuition so they can in fact leave the reserve but man when they leave the reserve they don't go back

47:53.280 --> 47:57.040
they go to like a canadian city and they work a regular job and they own a house themselves

47:57.040 --> 48:00.160
people who are stuck on the reserve they're they're stuck there and they can't leave

48:00.160 --> 48:04.800
and they don't really have anything a lot of stuff is just provided to them so it's become

48:04.800 --> 48:10.000
this this negative feedback loop where the government is willing to provide for them based

48:10.000 --> 48:17.200
on various uh treaty rights and based on the fact that um unlike in the united states canada's first

48:17.200 --> 48:21.840
nations were never really conquered in a sense so in the past there was this sense of allowing the

48:21.840 --> 48:28.000
first nations to live as they like in this reserve system however you know to be to be quite frank

48:28.000 --> 48:32.720
and open about it european technology was always significantly more advanced than than first

48:32.720 --> 48:38.640
nations technology and so when canada modernized and became you know a regional power and and

48:38.640 --> 48:44.400
became a world economic power in a sense and you know became one of one of the g8 and a first world

48:44.400 --> 48:49.680
nation and the whole bit um the first nations still living traditional lives were like well

48:49.680 --> 48:54.000
what the hell like aren't we part aren't we in canada too like how come we how come we're

48:54.000 --> 49:01.040
subsisting off the land as canada transforms itself into into this great nation and so it

49:01.040 --> 49:06.960
like there's it's become this limbo where the reserve system is broken it's not working the

49:06.960 --> 49:11.520
first nations people living within the system are completely destitute and addicted to a number of

49:11.520 --> 49:16.000
things but at the same time they're also very dependent on those handouts and it kind of goes

49:16.000 --> 49:22.560
both ways in a sense where where they're both victims of of the environment and of the government

49:22.560 --> 49:28.160
but also victims of themselves and each other it's it is it is appalling that this kind of thing

49:28.160 --> 49:33.200
happens in canada maxime bernie's solution here and he seems to be the only one who even talks

49:33.200 --> 49:40.560
about it is to basically remove the reserve system and privatize the the property within so that

49:40.560 --> 49:45.920
people actually own property now on the one hand that would be what helps them like fundamentally

49:45.920 --> 49:52.000
it would be at this on the other hand um it would completely destroy not only the reserve system but

49:52.000 --> 49:57.920
large parts of of uh of native culture and they don't want that and i understand that they don't

49:57.920 --> 50:04.720
want that but it's like you know you you can live a modern lifestyle or you you can't and if you

50:04.720 --> 50:10.160
can't you can't complain that you're not living a modern lifestyle this halfway half-assed solution

50:10.160 --> 50:16.800
of the reserve system uh is ruining the native population in canada it's terrible but but but

50:16.800 --> 50:21.600
the solutions are to to go backwards and live how they used to live before europeans uh showed up

50:21.760 --> 50:26.000
which is no good frankly like do you really want to do that if you're native and listen to this

50:26.000 --> 50:29.600
do you really want to do that do you really want to live without all modern conveniences

50:29.600 --> 50:33.280
and you want to live how your ancestors lived do you think you would survive a canadian winter

50:33.280 --> 50:38.080
like that maybe you would maybe some of you would you know but let's be honest here do you want to

50:38.080 --> 50:42.240
go without internet do you want do you want to go without all modern conveniences of life do you

50:42.240 --> 50:48.480
want to go without individual um human rights and all of the philosophical and political advances

50:48.480 --> 50:52.160
that european contact brought i know it brought a lot of terrible things but it also brought a lot

50:52.160 --> 50:58.880
of good things or do you want to join modern canada which by necessity means that you you

50:58.880 --> 51:03.520
you have to have private property and not have and not depend on government handouts there is no good

51:03.520 --> 51:08.240
answer to that even asking the question will get people angry at me and will make people offended

51:08.240 --> 51:13.120
and will probably get me labeled as a bigot and i commend maxime burnier you know another reason

51:13.120 --> 51:17.680
for them to call him a racist but he's actually asking a proper question and putting forward an

51:18.160 --> 51:22.320
imperfect solution but it's better than anything that anybody else wants to do the science is clear

51:22.320 --> 51:26.160
your target is a commitment to failure that's why it's so doable and achievable because it doesn't

51:26.160 --> 51:30.720
do what the ipcc says we must do we must go off fossil fuels as quickly as possible and you bought

51:30.720 --> 51:35.200
a pipeline you can't be a climate leader and spend 10 to 13 billion dollars more on a project that by

51:35.200 --> 51:41.600
itself blows through our carbon budget consider elizabeth may's uh rhetoric the green party rhetoric

51:42.320 --> 51:48.240
trudeau's plan is doable because it won't do anything is the implication that what we need

51:48.240 --> 51:54.800
to do to to solve the the the climate crisis if it is as you describe is the implication that

51:54.800 --> 52:02.880
what needs to be done is not doable because if that's the case then we're fucked anyway so what

52:02.880 --> 52:06.960
does it matter people must know that that mr shear and mr trudeau you're the same on climate change

52:06.960 --> 52:10.480
you want to impose a carbon tax on canadians and you want to impose more costly regulation

52:10.480 --> 52:13.120
i think that's the most offensive thing you said all night max we're the same on climate change

52:13.120 --> 52:18.160
you want to impose also a big tax so you're the same on climate change and you won't be able to

52:18.160 --> 52:24.400
achieve your target he hasn't said anything offensive that's the most offensive thing you've

52:24.400 --> 52:30.640
said all night max is it i mean maybe it is but he hasn't really said much in a way that's been

52:30.640 --> 52:37.440
offensive i know that these guys are desperate to to paint maxime burnier as as this white supremacist

52:37.440 --> 52:42.080
or something but it's getting pretty desperate you know the way to bring more public service

52:42.080 --> 52:46.800
to bring more help to canadians child care banning tuition investing in post-secondary education

52:46.800 --> 53:00.480
pharma care in bet banning tuition um i what happens to colleges then i mean part of the value

53:00.480 --> 53:08.320
of of of a college diploma or a university degree is that not everyone has them it sounds kind of

53:08.320 --> 53:14.480
harsh i know but it is the truth it is the truth of the matter you can't just ban tuition look at

53:14.480 --> 53:20.880
your platform elizabeth and you know you will spend 60 billion dollars spending won't create any wealth

53:20.880 --> 53:25.280
you cannot spend your way to prosperity we need to have more private sector investment and at the end

53:25.280 --> 53:29.520
you know you know that our national credit card is full did you see her laugh there hold on i'm

53:29.520 --> 53:35.440
going to go back look at her laugh when he says here hold on billion dollars spending won't create

53:35.440 --> 53:40.000
any wealth you cannot spend your way to prosperity we need to have more private sector investment

53:40.000 --> 53:45.280
and at the end you know you know that see she she laughs at the idea that you can't spend your way

53:45.280 --> 53:51.680
to wealth and i mean that is that is essentially uh the truth i mean yeah like in terms of

53:51.680 --> 53:55.600
businesses you have to spend money to make money you have to invest and and you know buy buy

53:55.600 --> 54:01.840
supplies and you know shit like that i understand that but she's laughing at the idea that

54:01.840 --> 54:07.520
governments can't spend their way to having a prosperous nation and no they can't because

54:07.520 --> 54:11.360
governments aren't in the business of doing business and i don't think she understands

54:11.360 --> 54:16.800
this because frankly she's a she's a communist and and that smile there is from somebody who

54:16.800 --> 54:25.840
who doesn't understand economics i guess so our national credit card is full we still have

54:25.840 --> 54:30.800
deficit and mr tudo just had 70 billion dollars on our debt and you'll have another 60 billion

54:30.800 --> 54:34.400
dollars on our debt it is not responsible our children will have to pay for that but you have

54:34.400 --> 54:37.760
you have your famous private sector having got massive tax cuts when you were in mr harper's

54:37.760 --> 54:40.480
cabinet based on being told these were the job creators and it would be great when they got tax

54:40.480 --> 54:43.920
cuts they have not invested in the economy they're sitting on piles of cash mark carney calls it the

54:44.000 --> 54:49.120
money we need to get that money and do public sector infrastructure so they're just scrooge

54:49.120 --> 54:54.720
mcducking it is that what it is they have they have big vaults of money that they swim around in

54:56.160 --> 55:01.680
i don't think that's what um that's what what the hardcore capitalists do now because it was

55:01.680 --> 55:05.120
she's talking about steven harper's government what the hardcore capitalists did in steven

55:05.120 --> 55:09.200
harper's government was take that money and then move it out of canada because they were

55:09.200 --> 55:12.640
they were multinationals they were globalists and that's something that maxime bernier

55:12.640 --> 55:17.200
does not like he talks about wanting to fight that in his platform so so this really is the

55:17.200 --> 55:22.080
problem with somebody who who is a socialist or is a communist is that they don't see an

55:22.080 --> 55:27.920
ideological difference between somebody who is a capitalist globalist and somebody who is a

55:27.920 --> 55:34.320
capitalist nationalist they just see capitalist and stop thinking right there our universal tax

55:34.320 --> 55:37.840
cut will mean 850 in the pocket of a hard-working average income canadian we're going to bring back

55:37.840 --> 55:41.120
the children's fitness tax credit to make raising children more affordable we're going to bring back

55:41.120 --> 55:44.400
the green public transit tax credit to make taking the bus or the train more affordable as well we're

55:44.400 --> 55:47.280
going to help fight climate change by bringing in the green home renovation tax credit which will

55:47.280 --> 55:49.840
put money in the pockets of canadians and help lower emissions and we're going to pay for that

55:51.840 --> 55:55.360
the way we're going to pay for those is by cutting corporate welfare and reducing canada's foreign

55:55.360 --> 55:59.040
aid budget by 25 so we're going to stop sending money to the relatively well-off countries we're

55:59.040 --> 56:02.160
going to bring that money back home so that canadians can get ahead mr share that may be

56:02.160 --> 56:05.840
the worst idea in your whole non-platform is the cutting of foreign aid i wear this little pin this

56:05.840 --> 56:08.800
is sustainable development goals the united nations to which this country is committed

56:08.800 --> 56:12.640
ending poverty within the next decade within canada and globally is actually possible but not

56:12.640 --> 56:15.280
if we ever had the misfortune of having your i believe you should take that money and bring it

56:15.280 --> 56:21.680
back home greedy and selfish policies hold on a minute hold on a minute so shears shear's plan

56:21.680 --> 56:26.320
is to not just tax the one percent you know to be fair i don't i don't believe that uh shear will

56:26.320 --> 56:30.640
ever tax the one percent even though he says he it's part of his platform i just don't think he

56:30.640 --> 56:36.640
will but he says he's gonna he's gonna start cutting canadian foreign aid why not if if

56:36.640 --> 56:42.000
canada's first nations are living under boil water advisories if we have homeless people here

56:42.000 --> 56:45.760
if we're cutting social programs and we're cutting education why are we still sending

56:46.400 --> 56:51.440
money overseas yeah sure those countries are are also not well off and they probably deserve some

56:51.440 --> 56:55.440
help but i mean one a lot of them are corrupt and the money doesn't go to actually helping the

56:55.440 --> 57:00.640
people and two we have our own people to deal with first it's it's it's the same ideology as

57:00.640 --> 57:06.800
the open borders people we can't take care of everyone and our priority is canadians if federal

57:06.800 --> 57:12.080
government was to respect jurisdiction of provinces it would take less time it would cost less money

57:12.080 --> 57:16.000
and provinces and quebec could do what they have to do about health care bring the money that is

57:16.000 --> 57:20.160
owed to quebec and provinces this is what has to be done lodging the money the money should be

57:20.160 --> 57:25.920
see it's it's always quebec and provinces as if they are two separate entities quebec is a

57:25.920 --> 57:29.360
province we recognize that we need to help people more directly that's why the first thing we did

57:29.360 --> 57:32.080
was lower taxes for the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest one percent we're moving

57:32.080 --> 57:36.400
again forward with a tax break for low and middle income canadians and nothing for the wealthiest

57:36.400 --> 57:39.760
unlike mr shear's universal tax credit we're also moving forward by increasing the canada child

57:39.760 --> 57:43.200
benefit which has lifted hundreds of thousands of families out of poverty by fifteen percent for

57:43.200 --> 57:46.800
kids under one we're increasing the old age security for seniors over 75 we're making sure

57:46.800 --> 57:49.760
that students have an easier time paying back their student debts by not having to pay back

57:49.760 --> 57:53.040
until they're making thirty five thousand dollars a year we're investing in canadians mr trudeau

57:53.040 --> 57:59.120
thank you mr bernier your turn man look at how quickly he just rattles those off that is pure

57:59.120 --> 58:04.880
rehearsed talking points and the honest truth is there's there's not much substance in those

58:04.880 --> 58:09.520
those numbers are are kind of iffy at best the few numbers that he actually did provide

58:29.120 --> 58:35.840
canadian under my watch that was the only uh good thing trudeau said the entire the entire debate

58:35.840 --> 58:40.320
mr shear you said in english a few months ago that you were strongly against the very idea of

58:40.320 --> 58:44.320
bill 21 about laicity of the state in quebec then you said in french in quebec that you would do

58:44.320 --> 58:50.000
nothing against that law but your very close collaborator mr allen reyes said the day before

58:50.000 --> 58:55.200
yesterday that you would protect the bill 21 he said that in french i must admit you would you

58:55.200 --> 58:59.360
were the only one that would protect the bill can you get to the question please how will you do that

58:59.360 --> 59:02.480
it's very uh this the answer to this question is very simple mr blanchette and you know that i've

59:02.480 --> 59:05.680
always been very clear on this issue we will not intervene in the court case that is currently

59:05.680 --> 59:09.040
before the courts uh the elected officials of quebec have taken this decision and now it is

59:09.040 --> 59:13.120
before the courts and the courts and the courts will protect protect the law that is exactly what

59:13.120 --> 59:16.640
we said in english and in french it's very important that a federal government respects

59:16.640 --> 59:20.000
and protects individual liberties and individual human rights we will not pursue this court of

59:20.000 --> 59:23.680
action at a federal level but mr shear has the floor in the law it's quite simple i just

59:23.840 --> 59:31.440
this happens a few times in this debate uh going forward where people just keep re-asking sheer

59:31.440 --> 59:35.440
a question and he says i just answered it like what are you talking about and in this case he did

59:35.440 --> 59:40.160
he said that he personally disagrees with bill 21 which is something we talked about much earlier

59:40.160 --> 59:47.040
in the debate but he will uh he will not uh use the use the federal powers to block it which i

59:47.040 --> 59:52.640
think is is a reasonable is a reasonable position to hold but rather than listen to that answer or

59:52.640 --> 59:57.440
respond to it um his opponent just asks the question again this is something that the federal

59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.800
level we will not pursue the conservative party has always stood for individual liberty for

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.360
fundamental human rights it was a conservative prime minister that brought forward the bill

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.440
of rights the last prime minister from saskatchewan except you won't defend a woman's right to choose

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.920
you you've dismissed lgbt lgbt protections you haven't apologized for your words

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:18.640
millions millions millions years ago will you okay okay so as i said they're they're gonna do it to

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.080
share again where first of all i don't i don't justin i don't think it's your place to bring up

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:30.080
things that happened years ago i i really don't think it's your place to bring up things that

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.920
happened years ago and ask for somebody to apologize for them will you recognize and

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.920
apologize for that millions of canadians have a different position on this issue and like millions

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.080
of canadians i am personally pro-life it is okay in this country to have a difference of opinion

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:52.720
canadians need to know one at a time please one at a time the laws and access on this issue have

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.360
not changed for 30 years under liberal prime ministers under conservative prime minister

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.480
now you probably couldn't hear that because they were just uh shouting over top of each other

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.440
but shear said he's personally pro-life and despite that the laws on abortion in canada

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.280
have not changed for 30 years um it's not it's not a court case like it is in the states with

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.560
roe v wade and he does not plan to disrupt the status quo despite his personal position

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:27.200
of being pro-life he does not want things to change as they are in canada and you know what

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.520
that doesn't matter because they just keep asking him over and over and over and over and over

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.200
will you respect a woman's right to choose will you respect a woman's right to choose

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.400
and he he's answered he just answered it but they don't want to listen to him see check it out

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.680
you have been not let's allow mr you're signing the nomination papers

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.440
nobody can nobody can hear what you're saying anymore and of course at this point it devolves

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.640
into a shit show and it's a whole bunch of virtue signaling and playing identity politics because

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.600
even though shear's not the greatest candidate he has some things going for him and at the same

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.600
time he also does resort to identity politics when because he knows that that's the game that's

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.680
currently being played right now into larger political discussion at the same time uh check

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:18.080
out maxime burnier's face here he is just so fed up with this nonsense like check it out we'll be

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:26.000
signing the nomination this is this is a man who knows this is an absurd discussion and has

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.840
checked out of the stupidity it's our next theme we've already talked about it a little bit but

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.560
now we will for real the environment and energy and we will talk about it a little bit half of

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.600
the entire thing so far has been about the environment and energy and i believe we live

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.440
in an age of climate crisis and this is the last election we have before a point of no return is

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:52.560
reached furthermore holy shit dude i i'm pretty sure that it's not quite that dire all right

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.960
i'm not saying it doesn't exist i just don't think that we're we are not headed for the barbecue you

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.480
know in the next few years or anything as mr blanchett said quebec and other provinces like

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.680
bc have moved forward with putting a price on pollution we've ensured that that price is put

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.120
in right across the country because it is a mechanism that will both lower emissions and

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.120
ensure that canadians can afford this transition the choice tonight is very clear between two

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.200
parties that have very different views see he didn't really answer the question before moving on

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:25.520
the the question was most businesses view the the carbon tax as just a price they have to pay

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.120
to enter into a marketplace and trudeau says yeah we've made the carbon tax um nationwide

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.920
yeah but that's not an answer to the question justin i don't know if you've noticed that's

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.400
how he handles a lot of things he spends maybe 15 seconds sidestepping a question and then the

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.320
rest of his time talking about talking points first of all we want to do things that are

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.400
possible we want to do things that are possible to protect our health our hair our environment

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.880
our water all the other leaders claim to save the world and to save the climate they cannot

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:59.280
canada represent only to 1.6 percent of the green gas emission there you go an actual figure canada

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:06.240
represents 1.6 of greenhouse gas emissions how do we stop climate change as canadians well it

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.640
seems like it might be a bit out of our control and also if we're only representing 1.6 while

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.680
places like the united states china and india represent in the double digits maybe we're

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.920
actually pulling our weight already maybe we're actually doing our share and they claim also to

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.240
be able to achieve the paris accord target they cannot they have to impose a carbon tax of 300

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.000
to do that and they won't do it they don't do it they're hypocrites we won't

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.560
have attacks on carbon there you go just straight up you're hypocrites refreshing to hear in a

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.800
debate i mean he might even be wrong about some things but at least he's willing to tell the truth

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.920
as he sees it and and not resort to talking points you know i'll i will take that respect for the

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.360
viewer now while mr trudeau has said a lot of nice things let's look at what he's done he said that

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.720
he's for the environment but then he continues to exempt the biggest polluters from his price on

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.920
pollution he says he wants to fight the climate crisis what does he do he continues to subsidize

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.240
oil and gas massively he says he's a climate leader what does he do he buys a pipeline

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:06.000
there's a big gap between what mr trudeau says and what he does yep have to agree with jagmeet again

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.520
um i don't like him as a candidate he seems like a good guy i don't like him as a candidate

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:18.080
but uh when he talks about the hypocrisy of trudeau he has his facts down you unlike everyone

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.680
else on this stage clearly understand that we're up against a real climate emergency the

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.920
intergovernmental panel on climate change has given us hard timelines challenging targets if

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.680
we've been given those hard timelines and challenging targets before may um i remember

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.040
being in the 90s and listening to the fact that by the year 2000 we'll be underwater

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.080
and society will have been destroyed we're still here when justin trudeau took office there were

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.720
three major pipeline projects ready to go under his watch all of them have failed he had to take

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.480
4.5 billion dollars of canadian tax money to put the trans mountain pipeline on life support and

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.480
he did that by sending 4.5 billion dollars of taxpayers money to another country to the

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.400
united states to be invested in the oil and gas sector there instead of here in canada his answer

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.640
for his rationale for having two campaign planes was that he bought carbon offsets which is just

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:10.400
a thing that privileged people can do that's right trudeau has two campaign planes flying around i

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:16.160
mean i don't know why he can just if he needs to go places as prime minister i understand you have

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.440
a plane why do you need two you can't fit can't fit everything on one plane we must double our

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.800
current target we must listen to science we must not build the trans mountain pipeline it's not

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.720
the last because it gets cancelled if we're serious you can't negotiate with physics you

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.440
can't as prime minister you can't just leave a leader of the liberal party there's a carbon

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.520
budget it doesn't budge and that's why it's so heartbreaking for me to look at you today and

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.400
know you could have done so much more the last four years please god you don't get a majority

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.240
this time around from the rockies from the rockies to the bay of fundy conservative premiers have

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.200
gotten elected on promises to do nothing on climate change and we need a strong federal

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.320
government to fight them to make sure that we are moving forward on protecting the future

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:53.280
generations from the impacts of climate change see this this argument here between uh may and trudeau

01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:01.440
it sounds it sounds like the uh the establishment leftist arguing with the ideologue and saying

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.280
you know please keep supporting me i have the best you've got and the ideologue saying no you're not

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.880
pure enough from correct first would you agree with the demand of the prime minister of quebec

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.040
mr lugo that quebec review and environmental issues will have precedence over canada's

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.400
overview second question do you promise after this judgment in british columbia

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:22.560
do not ever try to have a pipeline cross quebec ever after 10 years of mr harper's failures to

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.600
get things built because he did not understand you have to work with indigenous peoples you have to

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.040
work with local communities you have to respect environmental science we brought in a process that

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.040
does exactly that and we work with the provinces on ensuring that there's not a duplication of

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.960
environmental environmental oversight that's what bill c69 is all about we know that the way we move

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:43.280
forward is responsible and will be done and that's the time mr trudeau no answer who's surprised

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.080
also you know i've said this a few times now so maybe i'm just maybe just sound like a broken

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:53.280
record but uh the block guy really does talk like quebec is this separate country entering into

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.720
negotiations with canada no man no it's never going to happen mr trudeau it's now your chance

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.800
to ask a question of any other leader you have one minute to do so sir we cut taxes for small

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:07.040
businesses to nine percent uh we cut taxes for canadians we know that tax breaks for wealthy

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.800
do not work to grow the economy 10 years of mr harper's failure has done that yet mr shear's

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.240
platform what we've seen of it because most of it is still secret and will remain secret apparently

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.640
like doug ford that doesn't work out so well for ontarians um is to reduce taxes for the wealthiest

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:23.120
canadians the multi-millionaires by 50 000 which is more money than most canadians wrap it up

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.760
why the 50 000 you have one minute to respond mr shear there was there wasn't really a question

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:35.040
in there what's there yeah justin when when you're given a chance to ask another candidate

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.600
a question that's not doesn't mean you just shit on him for 30 seconds you actually ask him a

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.440
question so mr trudeau you seem to be oddly obsessed with provincial politics there is a

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.880
vacancy for the ontario liberal leadership and if you are so focused on provincial politics go and

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.560
run for the leadership of that part of mr trudeau your tax policy has meant that 80 of canadian

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.960
families pay higher taxes today than when you first took office that is exactly true that was

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.800
a conservative principle that liberals fought against that you fought against your signature

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.720
achievement was taking a conservative idea to send support directly to downstairs i voted against

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.280
your tax hikes on canadians mr trudeau that's what i was voting is no i did not we are committed one

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.640
at a time we are committed to protecting that benefit because it is based on conservative

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.680
principle but we are going to go this is supposed to be mr shear's answer we're going to move into

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.560
open debate for all canadians with a universal tax cut we're going to bring back the children's

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.680
sports and fitness that's it mr shear we've got three minutes on this open debate starting with

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.400
me yes that's right sir okay mr shear you did not answer the question on why you are lowering taxes

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.840
by 50 000 for multi-millionaires in this country maybe you'll answer it tomorrow in the press

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.560
conference but you haven't answered it tonight that is just not true you haven't answered a

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.840
question your entire time as prime minister i've sat across you you okay that is true i can

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.880
definitely um when it comes to making that new video i will definitely put in the the montage of

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.680
trudeau literally ignoring everything if you think this is the first time he's done this ignoring

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:56.720
every single question no man this is this is mo andrew you are calling yourself a conservative

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.880
but you don't want to balance the budget in two years you will have 70 billion dollars on our debt

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.720
you support the cartel in meal dairy and poultry knowing that the canadian family is paying more

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.240
than 400 a year for that andrew are you a real conservative no i think you are a liberals why

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:17.920
are you pretending to be something that you are not you know maxime vernier hasn't done the best

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.480
in this debate it's been a lot of fiery rhetoric it's been a lot of shooting from the hip a lot of

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:30.720
truth telling in uh in a platform in a place where there's not much truth telling i mean look at this

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.200
look at this happy motherfucker right here he he gets it it's really unfortunate because this

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.720
debate has not really touched on the places where maxime vernier is at his strongest which is um

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.560
free speech and uh canadian nationalism canadian values let's talk about pretending to be something

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.760
that you're not i'm not sure which maxime vernier i'm debating tonight was it the maxime vernier from

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.040
the 1990s who was a separatist was it the maxime vernier who was minister responsible for handing

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.120
out corporate welfare was it the maxime vernier who defended supply management when it suited him

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.840
the fact of the matter is sorry it's my it's my time to respond to that question the fact of the

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.440
matter is there's a clear contrast in the selection justin trudeau's endless deficits and tax hikes to

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.480
pay for or a conservative plan that will leave more money in your pocket we will lower taxes

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.160
for all canadians we'll bring back popular tax credits like the kids sports and fitness tax credit

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.000
we'll boost the resp we'll raise the age credit for seniors and we'll bring in a green home

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.920
renovation tax credit that all the while cutting corporate welfare and canada's foreign aid budget

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.280
to bring that money back home so that canadians can get ahead nine seconds well let's do open

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.360
debate off you go you're starting that too thank you very much i'm the maxime vernier who's there

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.200
for canadians and i'm the maxime vernier who does not care about having real debates on real issues

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.880
that are important for you don't want to have debates to help every canadian and abolishing

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.640
that cartel in supply management you don't want to be able to cut foreign aid you don't want to

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.880
cut foreign it's precisely not the case we've said that i've said that we will cut canada's

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.560
foreign aid budget by 25 to pay for the tax cuts that we can save five billion dollars there and

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.680
balancing the budget what this election is all about this election is all about who's

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.160
going to fight for you who's going to stand up for you okay see that see that okay so bernier

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.680
and shear get into it again and they have a discussion on the minutia of their policies

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:09.600
and it's an interesting discussion and then we got jagmeet's low iq intervention of this is

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.800
really about who's going to fight for you it's just a platitude it's just platitudes man

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:20.560
our price on pollution helps canadians more uh than removing it does okay see okay that was

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.720
interesting because she says yeah five seconds go that's kind of unfair that was a point that

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.600
needed more than five seconds to reply to so it makes sense that trudeau got a bit flustered there

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.080
at the end but you could tell he was like searching for the proper talking point and

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:40.480
they kind of mashed together because it it is all talking points with him it feels like

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.800
he didn't come here to actually have any kind of substantive discussion on these issues that's it

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.200
thank you that brings us to the end of this segment and to the end of this debate we want

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.080
to thank all of you of course for taking the time our questioners tonight and all of you for

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.960
watching live in person and on your various screens just a reminder as monsieur blanche

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.720
hinted at that french language debate is later on this week thursday at 8 p.m eastern on behalf

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:05.520
yep and that's useless uh because frankly uh fuck french maxime burnier's uh frankly massive social

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.960
media presence came up a few times in this debate and so i want to show you something along the

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:17.040
lines of what he he posts regularly this election will go down in history as the one where identity

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.440
politics went off the rails can we get back to debating policies this is an reply to the

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:28.320
official conservative party's um tweet that justin trudeau's next cabinet has racists misogynists

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.680
and conspiracy theorists in it he stands by all the maze and fire a single single one and i think

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.120
this can be best exemplified by that one bit where maxime burnier you know looked up at the sky shook

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:47.120
his head and then put his head down you know i i get it identity politics does not help anyone and

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:53.600
pretty much everyone there except maxime burnier um played on identity politics and of course we

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.520
would not uh and of course this wouldn't be a debate without a canadian flavored version of

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.680
somebody saying something over and over and over and over because saying it multiple times makes

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:10.080
it true i guess allowing maxime burnier on stage platforms white supremacy does it is maxime burnier

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:16.240
a a white supremacist are you sure about that nothing that he said in there sounds like white

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.320
supremacy to me he sound completely reasonable well maybe this is the white supremacy here

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.440
burnier promises to build border fences if he's elected prime minister he said we cannot be the

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:31.360
welfare state of the planet canada must look at look after its own citizens first and focus on

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.800
newcomers who bring economic value to the country he denounced mass immigration and extreme

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.360
multiculturalism saying these policies would lead to social conflicts and potentially violence

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.880
these ideas nothing to do with freedom his speech said but rather a very dangerous type of social

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.800
engineering he identified islamism or political islam as a threat to our values and way of life

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.640
and apparently half of respondents in a poll think immigration levels are too high well is

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.080
you wrong and is this racist to say i don't think it is i don't think it's white supremacist to to

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:10.560
to to point out that islamists um are basically cancerous to western liberal democracies they're

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.160
they're they're incompatible this is a lie based on the idea that all cultures cultures are equal

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.360
a lie destructive of our western liberal democratic heritage traditions and values

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:27.120
based on individual rights and freedoms where's the racism where's the falsehood a people's party

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.840
government would focus on religious minorities in majority muslim countries and members of

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:37.680
sexual minorities instead of refugees identified by the united nations what's the problem seriously

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:46.480
what's the problem what possible complaint could say the lgbtq uh community have uh against this

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:52.240
proposal if there are gay people fleeing muslim countries because they they will be killed for

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:58.240
being gay and they come to canada and they get a focus what's the problem is this white supremacy

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.520
maxine bernie vows to slash immigration impose a values test on newcomers a values test how

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:08.880
terrible but what's wrong with the values test both he personally and his party despises

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.280
prejudice in all forms but nonetheless they're going to break the taboo of immigration to canada

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.680
by forcing the conversation upon the country yeah see the idea of a values test seems completely

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:23.520
reasonable to me if you do not hold values that are in line with canadian values then why should

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.120
you come here maybe this is the white supremacy maybe we've finally found it former neo-nazi and

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:34.560
pagata canada official among the people's party party of canada signatories okay

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:40.480
you actually have an instance of potential white supremacy if a neo-nazi is showing up to maxine

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:46.800
bernie's political party okay there you go we found it oh apparently the party cut its ties

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.440
with him last month after his past involvement in the white nationalist movement came to light

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.920
while his position within the people's party of canada was unclear at the time the elections

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:02.560
canada forums disclose his role in registering the party okay so as soon as it became apparent

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:09.600
that there was a white supremacist they kicked him out is that not what you would want if if

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.800
you're going after the ppc for having white supremacists in it is this not exactly what

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.880
you would want to see what's the complaint there's a link here what does this say

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.640
man linked to neo-nazi group in the u.s no longer with the people's party of canada

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.360
is this not the appropriate response of course you have to know that uh tangible results will

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.240
never be enough um you know what would be better than all the white leaders congratulating jagmeet

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.320
on dealing with racism in the campaign actually coming up with a plan to deal with racism and

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.040
white supremacy and their platforms well it seems like the only person who's done that at least

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:57.680
publicly so far is maxime bernia by kicking a white supremacist out of his party now you don't

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:04.000
want to hear that you probably think he's the literal fucking devil but nonetheless look at

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.680
these replies here more like reverse racism those of us unfortunate enough to have been born white

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.760
always having to choose our words and apologize for policies and atrocities many generations ago

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:20.480
committed you know fair enough i am not responsible for anything people with my skin color did 100 or

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:28.240
200 years ago oh check out this reply no one likes you you you fucking showed him as this

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.840
debate gets going i want to be clear that mclean's harmful irresponsible decision to invite maxime

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:41.680
bernie is the story tonight yeah why was it harmful irresponsible is it because he actually

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:47.440
had a chance to put forward his idea listen if his ideas were actually dangerous um they would be

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.440
he would be blown off the stage and he wasn't that's kind of the point here is that you want

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.560
to de-platform people that you can't beat in a straight debate fascists don't deserve a place

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:06.640
on on the stage any stage but he's not a fascist seriously canes deserve the freedom to decide

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.840
no canes deserve freedom from fascism he's not a fascist fascist is not just people you disagree

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:19.760
with you idiots of course it comes from a joker dickbutt avatar but can't win on the on the debate

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.680
stage rig the debates that's how they do this shit man throughout the debates shear and bernie hammered

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.600
the theme of canada maxing out its credit card relatively unchallenged well it's because it's

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:36.320
true but debt to gdp is falling which is not really a related statistic uh public spending

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:43.600
can create growth no public spending it's private spending that creates growth public spending

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:48.960
creates a safety net that for people who who are say really hurting can kind of fall into and then

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.440
from there build themselves back up to self-sustainability public spending does not create

01:19:53.440 --> 01:20:00.240
growth and we have a civilizational duty to fund a green new deal no we don't the green new deal

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:04.960
failed in the states because it wasn't even about the climate it was about pushing socialism here

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.920
i'll end our post-election discussion since this has mostly just been uh twitter stupidity

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.960
with this this is google trends all right what you'll notice is that during the debate

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:22.800
um the most searched term from people on google in canada was for the people's party of canada

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.440
more than the other uh either parties by a fair amount you know the the conservatives were up

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:33.440
there for a bit the the the greens were up there liberals and ndp both at the bottom

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.960
and then the people's party massive spikes man i don't even think maxine brand did a particularly

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.280
good job but something must have come about in that debate that resonated with people because

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.400
people were looking them up people were looking them up and here they are this this is uh during

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.880
during the the time of the debate in fact right here everyone's looking them up and then you'll

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:59.600
notice um they're consistently reasonably high between last night when the debate happened and

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:05.040
now you know they're they're in the top three they're contending now this is google search

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:12.480
terms not um not votes not projections but something happened that people said hey

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:19.280
let's look into these guys and all the provinces of canada there's no data on the three territories

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:25.040
of north but during this period of time from the beginning of the debate until now and every

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:31.120
province except saskatchewan all of all the five parties the people's party is the most searched

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:40.080
that's crazy just putting maxime burnier on stage even though he didn't do that well got him some

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.160
pretty crazy reach that's that's nuts now of course you don't know what kind of searches

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:52.720
these are these could be people who are negatively predisposed towards the people's party of canada

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.120
and they're searching for uh not necessarily reasons revolving around supporting them like

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:02.480
we don't know but at the very least their name has been put out there and i think this is exactly uh

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:08.000
why jagmeet objected and why a lot of people on twitter are saying that he's a racist he's a nazi

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.080
he's he's a bigot he's all these things he shouldn't have been platformed because they know

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:18.960
that even though he flubbed the uh even though he flubbed the debate there was something about what

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:25.280
he was saying that was resonating with people and so they would rather him have not had a platform

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:31.360
to say it at all to every single brain-dead idiot who thinks that maxime burnier shouldn't have been

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:37.760
allowed on the stage because of fighting fascists or whatever here's a copy of the canadian charter

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.640
of rights and freedoms let's discuss the fundamental freedoms of all canadian citizens

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:47.200
everyone has the following fundamental freedoms freedom of conscience and religion freedom of

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:51.280
thought belief opinion and expression including freedom of the press and other media of

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:57.120
communication freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association every single time that

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:02.720
you label anybody that you disagree with a fascist every single time that you say that people should

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.800
not be allowed to partake in public life because you don't like their politics every single time

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.680
you either implement state force and suppressing opinions you don't like or whine that the state

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:19.120
is not doing it this is what you're pissing on and if you have to wonder why so many people

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:25.360
oppose you nowadays this is it you can't win debates so instead you try to stop them

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.080
all right chums that's about it for me this video was over four hours long this is going to be a

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:36.000
shitty one to edit i'll get it out as soon as i can i finished it at about 4 p.m october 8th

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.120
i want to get it out sometime tonight still on october 8th hopefully i will and most importantly

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:46.560
of all i'm going to continue with the canada stuff leading up until the election unless

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:52.960
something major happens i will keep doing these videos on various aspects of canadian society

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.560
because there are things unfolding including what's going on with justin trudeau that i think

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:04.320
are worth talking about before the election hits on the 21st that's the plan i will see you guys

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.560
next time i love you
