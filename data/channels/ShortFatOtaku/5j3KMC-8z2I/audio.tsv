0	5920	hey guys how's it going dev here uh the canadian elections are in two weeks hard to believe isn't
5920	10640	it we're almost there my personal prediction just uh just off the bat is that trudo is probably
10640	14960	going to get a minority government i hate to say it but i think it's true not because of his
14960	20080	strengths he's been a pretty terrible prime minister all things considered however his his
20080	24560	opponents aren't really that strong and to be frank that's why he won his first election it
24560	27840	wasn't because of his own strengths it was because of his father's good name and the fact that all of
27840	33360	his opponents were were quite weak but the elections in two weeks and last night was the
33360	40560	first and only english debate believe it or not there was an informal debate back in september but
40560	47040	trudo actually opted not to go he he refused the other leaders debated without him and in fact
47040	53040	i think to uh to showcase the point they left his podium empty on stage but we've got an
53040	57040	english-speaking debate that happened last night and we've got a french debate uh later in the week
57040	62400	that i'm not going to watch because screw that honestly french is kind of a joke language here
62400	66800	in canada they force a lot of us to learn it in schools and then we instantly purge those memories
66800	70480	from our brain the minute we graduate for the most part and i don't mean to poison the well here or
70480	75680	anything but having seen the debate it's it's my opinion that trudo didn't do very well and i would
75680	83680	like to showcase why so everyone get your uh your 4chan poll 2019 canadian election general debate
83680	89440	bingo cards ready and we're gonna see how many of these things we can tick off that's that's
89440	93760	some incredible artwork by the way i always love these things many canadians have felt the
93760	99920	implications of a divided world more so than 2015 from u.s protectionism to brexit to our growing
99920	105040	tensions with china as prime minister how would you effectively defend both the interests and
105040	109760	values of canadians on the world stage we know we live in a very challenging time right now from
109760	113280	protectionism to fear-based politics to the transformative technological change people are
113280	116800	facing we need to make sure that canadians are equipped and tooled to be able to succeed in an
116800	120320	uncertain world and that's why over the past four years we've invested directly in canadians help
120320	123440	people be optimistic about their future have the tools to succeed and the tools to see their kids
123440	127200	succeed we know the environment is a massive and pressing challenge and building a stronger economy
127200	129840	for the future means protecting the environment for the future as well these are the things we're
129840	133840	going to be talking about tonight this is something that you'll notice about trudeau
133840	139760	throughout this entire night he doesn't really bring up much in the way of concrete numbers
139760	145920	a few times he does and other candidates do a little bit more than he does but he is just a
145920	151280	walking talking point he's basically playing from the same handbook that he did five years ago
151840	156880	and that's not going to work this time in my opinion because he's now had five years of
156880	163520	government at least five years ago it was him outlining his his general values and then us
163520	168320	voting on them and saying okay maybe you know those values will translate into some kind of
168320	172880	concrete action down the road but he hasn't done most of the things he said he would do
172880	178160	during that first campaign and in this debate you'll notice he offers no excuse as to why those
178160	183120	things haven't been done and now with five years of government under your belt justin you can't
183120	188080	rely solely on values anymore because nothing's come of them but as you watch this you'll see
188080	192880	that's how almost all of his answers are framed a lot of talking points and a lot of dodging
192880	198240	questions about specifics we are the people's party and we put canada first the other leaders
198240	204240	on this stage are globalists they spend your money to buy this as u.n security council and also they
204240	208800	are giving your money to other countries to fight climate change in asia and build roads in africa
208800	214800	the u.n is a dysfunctional organization and we must be able to fight for our country actually
214800	219040	we are the only party that will have foreign policies that is based on our security and
219040	225920	prosperity for our country holy shit so i guess this is why this guy has kind of become a meme
225920	235440	in canada and elsewhere you you open the debate your first words by saying that everyone's a
235440	243680	globalist and the u.n is a corrupt organization i mean he's he's not wrong but holy shit
245200	249840	this guy is for those of you who don't know this is maxime bernier he's trying to position himself
249840	255920	as like the outsider conservative candidate he was a member of the conservatives for quite a long
255920	260720	time and he left to start his own party called the people's party which is in my opinion not not
260720	265280	a very good name it doesn't really ring conservatism at all it rings communism but it's not a
265280	270560	communist party um he left to start his own party because he viewed the conservatives as too corrupt
270560	275840	to be able to be fixed and he wanted to take his uh his connections and his clout elsewhere and
275840	280960	since then he's been trying to to to position himself as the the alt conservative i don't know
280960	285680	how it is in the rest of the world but in canada conservatism has been definitely branded with um
285680	291440	the stain of religious fundamentalism and he's trying to go with like the secular conservative
291440	296320	option kind of like donald trump in a sense but he's not as uh as bombastic as trump is almost
296320	300800	almost like the libertarian option in a sense where he's he's for small government he's for
300800	305840	devolution of powers he's anti-globalist he's kind of positioning his party to be kind of like the
305840	312400	ukip of of canada if that makes any sense and his remarks in social media are are meme worthy
312400	318800	they're bombastic they go viral regularly and and frankly it's definitely one of those emperor has
318800	324400	no close situations because as you'll see in this debate he doesn't say too much that's unreasonable
324400	329040	and yet he's branded as like a white supremacist it's kind of unreal to watch to me leadership is
329040	332960	about who you're fighting for the choices you make and whether you're doing what's right for people
332960	336640	and whether it comes to international affairs standing up to trump making sure we fight to build
336640	339440	a better trade agreements that actually put canadians first for me the question really comes
339440	343440	down to do you have the courage to stand up to the powerful and wealthy interests the corporations
343440	347120	that are having too much influence over canada and i've seen so far in ottawa whether it's liberal
347120	349760	conservative governments they haven't had the courage to stand up and fight for people we're
349760	353120	different we're in it for you i don't work for the rich and powerful i work for people this is
353120	359120	the ndp candidate uh jagmeet singh the ndp is they were born out of the canadian communist party back
359120	363760	in i think the 60s or the 70s they they reformed themselves and became the new democrats they're
363760	370240	basically canada's equivalent of i guess the lib dems they're hard left very hard left definitely
370240	376160	socialist definitely full of social justice warriors in a sense and although jagmeet is
376160	382400	kind of down to earth in a lot of ways um there are also just ways where he he operates an
382400	387840	ideology he doesn't explain much regarding uh how he's going to do the things that he wants to do
387840	392400	he talks about standing up to trump which is quite honestly he just shoved that in there because it
392400	397760	was a virtue signal he talks a lot in this debate about um you know expanding various social
397760	401200	programs but he never actually talks about how he's going to pay for it he talks about taxing
401200	405120	the one percent he never actually talks about what happens when the one percent leave canada
405120	409440	because canada's not the united states you know a lot of the richest people in the united states
409440	414240	and a lot of the biggest corporations still might not leave the u.s even if they got more heavily
414240	419040	taxed because they're a massive market canada isn't that there is very little that someone
419040	425360	like jagmeet can do to prevent capital flight from happening to canada so i just don't think
425360	429920	he understands how delicately he has to tiptoe around the situation he thinks he can just
429920	433520	bulldoze in with state force it's not going to work like that of course i will always stand up
433520	436640	for canada and canadian's interests and promote free trade and defend our interests all around the
436640	440800	world but justin trudeau only pretends to stand up for canada you know he's very good at pretending
440800	444480	things he can't even remember how many times he put blackface on because the fact of the matter is
444480	448080	he's always wearing a mask he puts on a reconciliation mask and then fires the attorney
448080	452080	general the first one of indigenous background he puts on a feminist mask and then fires two strong
452080	455760	female MPs for not going along with his corruption he puts on a middle-class mask and then raises
455760	459280	taxes on middle-class canadians mr trudeau you are a phony and you are a fraud and you do not deserve
459280	469840	to govern this country holy okay so this is okay andrew shear leader of the tories he's always been
469840	474640	kind of a milquetoast kind of dude and i think this is him trying to break out of that shell
474640	480480	with you know only half success this is supposed to be okay shear i don't know if you know what
480480	486720	this this these 45 seconds are for you to outline your platform not just a shit on trudeau i mean i
486720	493040	enjoyed it but i think you might i think you might have squandered your opportunity also that's the
493040	498080	only mention of the blackface it never comes up again judo never responds to it they just kind of
498080	501280	whitewash that shit which i guess is appropriate because that's what you have to do to get that
501280	504400	makeup off hey justin but i want to start by acknowledging that we're on the traditional
504400	507200	territory of the algonquin peoples into them the which canada's role in the world is an
507200	510560	amiable one we have a historic reputation for being an honest broker for being a country that
510560	513760	stands up for multilateralism we have a commitment as a nation to meet the sustainable development
513760	517520	goals which means our future as a world is built on ending poverty and encouraging the education
517520	521360	of women and girls that's a cornerstone on top of that we really need to renegotiate the world trade
521360	524560	organization and make it an organization that promotes climate action we need a world trade
524560	528160	and climate organization we need to support the rule of law and human rights around the world
528160	535520	because we are world leaders there's the greens elizabeth may um she's very popular and she almost
535520	541120	always wins her seat whenever she runs for it but nobody else in her her party has ever won a seat i
541120	546400	think aside from like one or two other times um so the green party despite constantly getting
546400	552960	platformed in these debates is is not much of a political force in canada and her party basically
552960	559040	competes with with space with the ndp because they have very similar policies um in fact they
559040	565120	could probably just merge and be one party frankly it's just that she just wants to run for herself i
565120	570000	guess i don't know i don't quite know i think it's because the greens are more environmentally
570000	574160	focused than the ndp even though the ndp is quite environmentally focused also she is the prime
574160	579520	virtue signaller of the bunch every single time she talks about a location in canada she talks
579520	585840	about the the native people that used to inhabit that location before europeans came over i get the
585840	590400	point i understand but it's not relevant to the debate i think everybody and thank you for having
590400	594880	me on behalf of the block having leadership or showing leadership sometimes mean not making
594880	599520	mistakes and arresting the chief financial financial officer of we might have been a big
599520	605280	mistake for which farmers growing soya or those who import or be might have paid the price when
605280	610880	you're facing a powerful foe like china you don't try to show biceps if you have only tiny biceps
610880	615280	and this is something that has to be learned and we would support somebody with real leadership
615280	622000	not making mistakes hit the fucking gym trudeau okay this guy is the um leader of the block
622880	627760	the block are the quebec separatists for some reason they always run in the national elections
627760	633760	even though they only run candidates in quebec and they only have interest in quebec politics
633760	639840	and frankly their long-term goal is to have quebec leave canada i have no clue why this guy is here
639840	644720	i don't know why their party keeps getting invited back if they don't want to be part of the national
644720	649360	discussion and frankly i don't really care much about this guy's opinions because he always talks
649360	655120	about quebec rather than canada he always talks about what he'll do for people living in quebec
655120	660320	not for canadians i don't know man mr bernier you like to tweet so let me read some of your
660320	665680	tweets back to you uh you called diversity in canada a cult and extreme multiculturalism
665680	670720	you've used the words ghetto and tribes to describe newcomers whom you say bring distrust
670720	675760	and potential violence on greta tunberg the 16 year old climate change activist you called her
675760	680560	quote clearly mentally unstable are these the words of someone with the character and integrity
680640	687680	to lead all canadians and represent us on the world stage oh yeah okay okay
689520	693120	the question you must tell the truth to canadians if you want to be the leader of this country
693120	697520	and what i'm saying about extreme multiculturalism it is not the way to build this country yes this
697520	701360	country is a diverse country and we must be proud of that but we don't need the legislation like the
701360	705600	multiculturalism act to tell us who we are we are a diverse country and we are proud of that what i'm
705600	708800	saying because it's in line with the immigration i'm saying that we must have fewer immigrants in
708800	712800	this country to be sure for these people to participate in our society so it is a great
712800	716480	country but it's time to have a discussion about the immigration we don't want our country to be
716480	720160	like other countries in europe where they have a huge difficulty to integrate their immigrants and
720160	723680	i'm a proud canadians and that's why i love this country and i'm the only leader on this stage who
723680	728640	wants to have a discussion about the level of immigration completely reasonable there's nothing
728640	734000	in that statement that was inflammatory simply having a concern about about integration does
734000	738560	not make you a racist or a white supremacist wanting a cap on immigration so that you may
739120	744880	preserve the unique culture of the host country is not unreasonable and he's right when he says
744880	748480	that nobody up there wants to actually have a discussion about this issue the conservatives
748480	752640	and the liberals are fine with open borders because that gives big business an underclass
752640	758080	from which to draw cheap labor the greens and the ndp are fine with open borders for for ideological
758080	763200	reasons maxime bernier is the only person who's saying slow immigration i mean trudeau wants
763200	769840	350 000 immigrants to canada a year that's wild and i've got an upcoming video on trudeau that
769840	773680	i'll put out probably at the end of the week or something where um where i discuss some of the
773680	779200	stuff in more in more detail but trudeau has also said that canada is a nation with no identity
779200	783840	which is complete bullshit it's complete bs and and there's not much in the world that actually
783840	789600	offends me but that's pretty offensive justin the reason that i side with maxime bernier on this
789600	794880	issue is because he seems to be the only actual political leader who wants to see the the
794880	799600	preservation of canadian values and canadian culture i mean mr bernie after hearing what was
799600	802080	just said you could have just said hey man i messed up because those are pretty horrible
802080	807680	tweets that you made and those aren't horrible dude jagmeet those aren't horrible tweets those
807680	814240	are completely reasonable jagmeet you're a sikh your religion was founded as a reaction
814240	819280	to muslims attacking your people and you're going to sit here and talk about how multiculturalism
819280	824240	is good you can say that because you're a sikh because the sikh community has integrated into
824240	830480	the commonwealth very nicely and you actually respect human rights but the islamists the people
830480	836960	who would impose sharia on you and i jagmeet they don't respect those values and you can't simply
836960	842160	say that all people are the same because that's just they're just not and it's not a race thing
842160	847120	man it's not a racist thing it's not a bigoted thing it's an ideology thing all people are
847120	852480	compatible with canada but not all ideologies are compatible with the canadian values that's what
852480	857200	this boils down to and you are too cowardly to say that really for me i mean should come as no
857200	860400	surprise to you i believe a leader is not someone who tries to divide people or to pit people
860400	863600	against each other a true leader someone tries to find bridges bringing people together that's what
863600	867120	a leader does and a leader works for the people who need help not helping those at the very top
867120	869760	which we've seen with governments in ottawa for far too long they've been working to make life
869760	873280	easier for the multi-billionaires they get massive corporate tax cuts billions of dollars go towards
873280	877040	them we see offshore tax havens continue this is not the way to build the country the way to build
877040	883840	the future is completely unrelated jagmeet this is not the conversation the conversation is
883840	890480	multiculturalism you can't just swing it back around to to your talking points of of basically
890480	894640	communism i find the things that maxine bernier has said to be completely appalling and he knows
894640	897120	that i feel that way about the things he says in the house we used to sit together and generally
897120	900960	when he said anything i'd have to put my head in my hands because it was so horrific i appreciate
900960	904640	you but you know i don't share your policies i don't share your socialist policies because you
904640	908320	know we won't be able to create any wealth with your policies you have the same kind of policies
908320	915520	than socialist countries like venezuela that won't and see it's he's he's right you know he
915520	920720	if you turn if you turn the government's attention toward the redistribution of wealth you don't
920720	925440	generate any new wealth you might be able to equalize the the amount of wealth that exists
925440	930000	the amount of value that currently exists in the nation but no one's going to be inclined to create
930000	936240	new value and yes value is not a zero-sum game people can create it through their own hard work
936240	940400	that's why people on the far left can never answer the question what do you do when you
940400	944080	run out of other people's money because those people now that they've had they've had all
944080	947840	their all their money taken from them they're not going to want to keep working are they going to
947840	951200	keep running their business and just to have the government steal it from them no they're going to
951200	956640	leave and i think more importantly the the things that maxine bernia has said uh they're not really
956640	962400	that appalling they're they're quite normal extreme multiculturalism has failed pretty much
962400	966720	everywhere i don't know why this is such poison to say but you have to have integration they're
966720	972080	acting like he's he's this pariah for even suggesting the fact that people move to canada
972080	978560	to become canadians what the hell man immigration is not that much a matter of number it's a matter
978560	982800	of resources we invest in it in order to have those persons welcome as well in canada as they
982800	987760	are in quebec with our desire for them to share our language to share some of our values and if
987760	993120	we do have enough resources invested in that this is workable and you do not do it by saying or
993120	998000	sending the message that they are not welcome the block's always been a little bit hard to pin down
998000	1003520	on the basic uh on the traditional political spectrum because in some ways they are very very
1003520	1008800	left and in some ways they're very very right they're very left socially however when it comes
1008800	1014480	to to quebec sovereignty they're very very right they want their language their culture to be
1014480	1019360	to be protected and paramount at the same time you'll notice this guy again said quebec and
1019360	1024880	canada as if they are separate things he has an adversarial relationship with the nation that he
1024880	1031360	is a part of which is why i consider him to be a joke everybody's will come in this country and
1031360	1035360	you know 49 of our population believe that we must have fewer immigrants they are not racist
1035360	1038480	they're not radical so what you are saying because i'm in line with the majority of our
1038480	1041760	population that i'm supposed to be a radical we have the right we have the right in this
1045600	1050560	absolutely and we are proud we are proud canadians see there you go half of people
1050560	1056880	in canada do not want more immigrants and his reply is we're all immigrants you know
1056880	1061520	technically true the people that were here you know 600 years ago were native people not
1061520	1067200	not european people i get the argument but we have come to accept that colonization's not a
1067200	1072800	good thing i mean we can't do anything about it now it would be a great injustice to remove all
1072800	1077280	white people from north america now but just because we did one horrible thing in the past
1077280	1081280	does that mean that we should keep letting it happen should we allow colonies of non-integrative
1081280	1085680	people to come into canada and just fuck the nation up is that what we should do is that
1085680	1090400	the argument here and no the half of canadians who don't want any more immigration they're not
1090400	1094720	racist for wanting that he's not a racist for putting forward that idea i think it's important
1094720	1098400	to recognize we're in a world right now where these discussions this polarization this fear
1098400	1102320	of the other has become easy currency for politicians who do want to strike up uncertainty
1102320	1105120	in people's hearts and lift those anxieties and try to get people to vote against things
1105120	1109040	unfortunately mr bernier on this stage is playing that role of trying to uh to make people more
1109040	1112080	fearful about the migrations that are happening in the world and the opportunities around
1112080	1115680	globalization and our ability to continue to redefine every single day what it is to be
1115680	1121360	canadian listen to this fucking guy just listen just listen migration around the world just seems
1121360	1125840	to be a a good thing for him and if you're afraid of it well then you're just being fear-mongered by
1125840	1130240	some kind of racist leader or maybe you're a racist yourself who knows globalization's uh
1130240	1136000	a great thing it's a goal you know take take the power centers away from local people and put it on
1136000	1140400	a different continent or in a different country or something somewhere far enough that that regular
1140400	1144720	people just can't do anything about it that's a great thing isn't it trudeau and if you object
1144720	1150480	to any of this you're just you're just fearful ignorant small-minded it's such bs you must
1150480	1154240	celebrate who we are and i'm proud canadian like you and you know we build this country together
1154240	1157520	and we want this country to be like that in 25 years we love this country and it's not because
1157520	1165200	i want to have a discussion about immigration publicly what mr shear thinks privately so that
1165200	1173120	line went viral that maxime bernier only exists to to push the more radical elements of conservatism
1173120	1179040	that andrew shear can't actually speak into the public limelight um i don't think that's the case
1179040	1184160	i don't think that he's you know uh paid opposition or anything like that i think maxime bernie is a
1184160	1189520	patriot who wants to see canada as it currently exists uh continue meanwhile justin shiro talks
1189520	1194400	about redefining what it is to be canadian you know what it is to be canadian is pretty well
1194400	1199120	defined all right and i don't agree with some of those definitions but i get it all right there's
1199120	1203520	there's english and french in my opinion there should be probably ojibwe as as a third language
1203520	1207440	we have history with the native people here some very bad history with the native people here let's
1207440	1212640	be honest at the same time there's obviously a lot of good about canada as it currently stands
1212640	1216000	there's obviously a lot of good things that we do there's a lot of good things that we have that
1216000	1220960	we've created a lot of good that we've built up here we don't need to redefine canada to to the
1220960	1226240	point that suddenly people who are completely against our values can be considered canadian
1226240	1231040	no they can't i'll just be honest here and if this makes me a radical or something so be it if
1231040	1236160	you have a a muslim immigrant who wants to implement sharia law in canada i don't consider
1236160	1241120	them canadian i don't consider them part of canadian values i don't think we should redefine
1241120	1247040	ourselves to include them as part of who we are they are antithetical to who we are i will respect
1247040	1250880	the constitution i will respect provinces and that's very important and i won't interfere in
1250880	1254960	provincial jurisdiction i want to interfere in health care because it is a provincial jurisdiction
1254960	1258640	and you know we cannot in ottawa solve the challenges that we're having for health care
1258640	1262640	and what we can do we can transfer the money to the provinces and what i will do i will let
1262640	1266480	provinces being able to deal with health care and education that's our constitution will transfer the
1266480	1270240	gst so provinces will have the money to deal with that and they will be able to answer to your
1270240	1276080	challenges so there you go devolution of powers do not infringe on on the rights of the provincial
1276080	1280720	governments to to act in their own domains that seems reasonable to me the new democratic
1280720	1283920	government we will bring in universal farm maker for all you would use your health card not your
1283920	1287680	credit card for medication how are you going to pay for it again it never comes up how it's going
1287680	1291920	to be paid for he he talks about taxing the one percent but he doesn't really know what that
1291920	1296560	entails or how you have to do it jagmeet operates on pure ideology if you want cooperation with
1296560	1301200	provinces or quebec you need to respect the jurisdiction and something that you have to
1301200	1306480	provinces or quebec as if quebec isn't a province fuck you in 10 years of steven harper's government
1306480	1309680	he chose to stop meeting with premiers and first ministers meetings and we restarted that when we
1309680	1313680	took office in 2015 we were able to strengthen the cpp for a generation we were able to sign historic
1313680	1317120	health accords with massive investments in in home care and in mental health we were able to invest
1317120	1320560	in infrastructure like housing and public transit across the country and we continue to work with
1320560	1325200	provinces on renegotiating in naphtha that it had everyone playing on one team canada but yes with
1325200	1328240	certain provinces right now we're fighting on the defining issue of our time because jason kenny and
1328240	1331840	doug ford and other conservative premiers don't want to do anything on climate change and we need
1331840	1335600	a government in ottawa that is going to fight them and fight for canadians on climate change and
1335600	1341360	that's exactly what we're going to do those of you don't know doug ford is he's basically a trump
1341360	1348880	style candidate that won the ontario premiership and he has become a uh a liberal boogeyman in a
1348880	1353360	sense now doug ford he's he's not a great politician um frankly he's kind of like he's
1353360	1359600	kind of a shitbag but he is like trump was a pressure release valve because the previous
1359600	1365760	premiere had acted so poorly in how they operated that people said you know what we will take the
1365760	1370960	shitbag over institutional corruption and it was important that doug ford got elected i don't think
1370960	1376000	he's he's good at his job at all at the very least it was a slap to the left saying that we will take
1376000	1381680	somebody this bad over you because you're worse you're the worse of the two evils not the better
1381680	1386320	but more importantly trudeau mentioned uh stephen harper's predecessor he mentions harper a lot
1386320	1389520	because harper was prime minister for something like 10 years uh something around those lines
1390160	1395440	and he doesn't actually have much to say about andrew shear he just talks about stephen harper
1395440	1400720	when he talks about the toys um maybe because i don't know maybe because shear hasn't formed
1400720	1404320	government yet so you can't really really critique what he would do maybe it's because he wants to
1404320	1411120	establish some kind of direct link between shear and harper but the truth is harper was only so so
1411120	1415520	as prime minister he didn't have the best stints as leader of canada but he was better than trudeau
1415520	1420000	and i think on some level trudeau needs to needs to understand that he's not running against harper
1420000	1425040	this time the field is different than it was in 2015 you criticized mr harper on his climate
1425040	1428000	targets but you failed to achieve them you criticized mr harper on the fact that he cut
1428000	1431920	healthcare funding you also cut them you criticized mr harper and conservatives on giving billions to
1431920	1435440	billionaires and corporations but you gave 14 billion more the question is this why do you keep
1435440	1439040	letting down the people that voted for you first thing we did was cut taxes for the middle class
1439040	1442240	and raise them for the wealthiest one percent and on climate change after 10 years of stephen
1442240	1446000	harper doing nothing in just four years we've reached three quarters of the way to our 2030
1446000	1449680	targets which we will meet and surpass but we know that's not enough we're going to continue to do
1449680	1453520	more like planting 2 billion trees like moving forward on giving money up front so people can
1453520	1458320	retrofit their homes on making canada net zero by 2050 we know how important it is to move forward
1458320	1462880	and right now mr shear has promised that the first thing he would do is rip up the only real plan to
1462880	1465760	fight climate change that canada has ever had these are the things we're going to be moving
1465760	1469520	forward on because canadians expect us to we lifted 900 000 people out of poverty with our
1469520	1472720	investments in families with the canada child benefit and things that actually mr shear and
1472720	1476800	mr singh the ndp voted against another thing that happens throughout the entire debate is that trudeau
1476800	1482560	he kind of tries to play the middle and he puts on all these different hats so for example when
1482560	1487120	the people on the left attack him like the ndp and the greens he says no no look at all the
1487120	1491600	leftist things we've done our way is working and then when people on the right attack him
1491600	1495360	well he doesn't actually try to play the right at all he just kind of calls them discriminatory
1495360	1499360	but you know whatever the point is that he's getting hammered from both sides and to some
1499360	1503280	extent that's kind of accepted because he is the incumbent so everyone's going to try and take pot
1503280	1507840	shots at him at the same time it really seems like no one is happy with him and there is a lot
1507840	1512560	of legitimate criticisms to be leveled at him to which he just reverts the talking points as as he
1512560	1517040	just did in reality statistics canada points out in 2017 the wealthiest actually paid less in tax
1517040	1519600	and gained more in wealth and when we look at one of the biggest problems that we're faced with as
1519600	1523280	a country is offshore tax havens now not only did your finance minister use offshore offshore tax
1523280	1526480	havens but also the president of the treasury boarding she also used offshore tax havens so
1526480	1529360	how can you tell canadians we don't have the money to fund things like universal pharmacare
1529360	1534400	when you're talked to cabinet ministers don't pay their fair share see at the very least we can go
1534400	1539920	to stats can 2017 now if we wanted and look up to see whether or not that figure was true you can in
1539920	1544400	fact hit up some older news articles and check out the corruption of trudeau's ministers i don't i
1544400	1549360	don't like jagmeet but at the very least he talks about tangible things rather than talking points
1549360	1554960	and yeah i have a a basically a trouble with trudeau 2 video coming before the election
1554960	1559280	describing a lot of his problems and oh boy does he have some problems right now mr trudeau has
1559280	1563040	not changed the climate targets from those of mr harper it needs to be said very clearly and
1563040	1566720	i'm so disappointed because i believe the liberals in 2015 that they would go with science-based
1566720	1571360	evidence-based policies but the target is saying he will hit by 2030 is a target for losing the
1571360	1574880	fight against climate change because it ignores the science it ignores the ipcc advice on this
1574880	1578480	stage tonight the green party is the only party with a plan mission possible actually
1580160	1586640	here's the thing about the environment insofar as canada is concerned canada produces 1.6 percent
1587600	1593200	of the world's um the world's emissions isn't china like 20 isn't the states like 20 isn't
1593200	1600320	india like 17 or something i don't have the numbers offhand but talking like if canada
1600320	1605280	doesn't do something the planet will burst into flames or something is is ridiculous when it
1605280	1610880	comes to climate change we are small players it's the honest truth i don't think canadians like to
1610880	1616080	hear that but it's the truth none of these people on the stage frankly even maxime burnier want to
1616080	1621920	admit this but it's the truth now maxime burnier's argument is is that all of these restrictions
1621920	1625200	that you have to put to to hit climate change will actually destroy the economy you can hear
1625200	1631040	you can hear him say it right here see he says destroy the economy and that's because that's
1631040	1637920	because they will so here we are we have leaders who want to wreck canada's economy to try and meet
1637920	1643920	their quotas in climate change however canada's output is so small that even meeting those quotas
1644560	1648960	won't have much long-term impact of the plans that are forward here on the stage there's only
1648960	1652400	one plan that the experts is qualified as both ambitious and doable and that is the plan that
1652400	1656800	we have begun to put in place mr trudeau's plan is failing it is making everything more expensive
1656800	1660000	for hard-working canyons and he has granted a massive exemption to the country's largest
1660000	1663840	emitters our plan takes the climate change fight global recognizing that canada can do more to
1663840	1666800	fight climate change by exporting our clean technology and helping other countries lower
1668480	1674400	see there you go helping other countries lower their emissions and export clean technology
1674400	1680480	boom sounds decent to me i don't know why this guy's getting maligned for for this but it sounds
1680480	1684080	good to me your campaign is about courage but you have not shown the courage to fight kibex
1684080	1687680	discriminatory law it bars individuals who like yourself wear religious symbols from some
1687680	1691440	provincial employment if you were prime minister would you stand back and allow another province
1691440	1695440	to discriminate against its citizens aren't you and frankly the other leaders on the stage putting
1695440	1699920	your own party's interests in quebec ahead of your principles and equality rights of all citizens you
1699920	1703120	have a minute to answer sure uh it's probably pretty obvious to folks that i am obviously
1703120	1708800	against bill 21 it is something that hurts me bill 21 by the way it it uh it basically means that you
1708800	1715280	can't wear religious um religious iconography if you're working for the government in quebec so no
1715280	1721360	crucifixes no turbans no hijabs or i guess anything else that you would wear i guess like yarmulkes
1721360	1726560	or anything it they basically want to enforce a secular state i don't like the idea of that
1726560	1732160	because you know um individuality human rights restricting that stuff might be the lesser of two
1732160	1737520	evils if if integration if a lack of integration is getting that bad i think about all the times i
1737520	1739920	grew up being told that i couldn't do things because the way i looked i think about all the
1739920	1742960	people in canada that grow up being told they can't achieve more because of their identity or
1742960	1749120	who they are i think about who says that i have not met a single canadian outside of the oldest
1749120	1755600	hillbillies who say shit like that anymore i think that attitude's gone i think even among like more
1755600	1760400	conservative people that attitude's gone people in quebec right now that are being told just because
1760400	1763440	they wear hijab that they can't be a teacher or if they wear yarmulke they can't be a judge and
1763440	1766880	that's hurtful it's wrong and it probably comes as no surprise that i'm opposed to laws that divide
1766880	1770560	people what i do every single day when i go to quebec is i say hey i'm here i'm someone that believes
1770560	1773520	in fighting climate the flight fighting the climate crisis i'm something that believes in
1773520	1776640	firmly and unequivocally the rights of women the right of women to choose and to build more access
1776640	1780160	to abortion services i believe firmly in making sure we tackle the powerful corporations that are
1780160	1784160	that are influencing government and that are not allowing other none of this is related it's
1784160	1788320	talking points i believe it's very important for for people to understand that well we will not
1788320	1791280	intervene in this court case as a conservative government we do recognize and the conservative
1791280	1794880	party always stands for freedom and equality and individual liberty and we will make sure that this
1794880	1798160	does we will not pursue this type of bill i appreciate that i want to touch on one of the
1798160	1803440	themes of this discussion here's what's interesting um he said that his government will not interfere
1804080	1808080	in the province's right to pass this bill but he would not introduce it federally
1808080	1812880	i think that's important you can disagree with something and still not take legal action against
1812880	1819200	it and that is in fact part of the devolution of powers um it's not simply using the government as
1819200	1825120	a hammer to bludgeon everyone and everything in your path and i think the right both the tories
1825120	1829840	and and the people's party understand this a bit more than the left does we all have done through
1829840	1836080	this rather strange period of an election campaign confronting issues of of of privilege and anyone
1836080	1841760	with white skin has privilege but when we look at bill 21 in quebec oh god with 70 of the population
1841760	1845200	of quebec supporting the bill 21 and 70 of the members of parliament in quebec supporting bill
1845200	1851920	21 it's not only a polarization issue in quebec see this is where this guy's um quebec not canada
1851920	1856560	attitude kind of serves him even though i still think it's it's kind of stupid in this context
1856560	1862960	but he says hey where i'm from it's not a polarizing issue 70 of people in quebec want
1862960	1869600	this bill so even though the block does sometimes promote socialist policies they're also very much
1869600	1873760	for the devolution of powers it's like i said they're hard to pin down on the spectrum but i
1873760	1880160	do know that being like a quebec only party in a canadian national election is just ridiculous on
1880160	1886640	the face of it it's kind of like the um the the scottish national party who who run in the uk's
1886640	1889280	elections like they're never going to form a government because they're only interested in
1889280	1892480	scotland interesting you have spoken very eloquently about discrimination and fought
1892480	1896320	against it all your life um and that's why it's so surprising to have heard you say like every
1896320	1900640	other leader on the stage the federal government under you would not intervene in the question of
1900640	1905680	bill 21 in quebec it's a question where yes it's awkward politically because as mr blanchette says
1905680	1909600	it is very popular but i'm the only one on the stage who has said yes a federal government might
1909600	1912720	have to intervene on this because the federal government needs to protect minority rights needs
1912720	1916880	to protect language rights needs to protect women's rights and needs to do that right across the
1916880	1921440	federal government needs to be a hammer it's like i said he doesn't understand that you can't simply
1921440	1927200	use the powers of the government to bludgeon your way into everything you didn't say that you would
1927200	1930320	possibly intervene you didn't even leave the door open and that's not let's be honest for a second
1930320	1934080	here every single day of my life is fighting a bill like bill 21 so every single day of my life
1934080	1936800	if you form government every single day of my life is challenging people who think that you
1936800	1942080	can't do things because the way you look every man you you are one of the most privileged people
1942080	1948480	in canada you're on a national stage with the leaders of other parties you are the leader of
1948480	1955360	a prominent party yourself and you're talking about every single day is is is fighting this kind
1955360	1961760	of oppression like are you kidding me you know i i get it brown skin turban beard some people are
1961760	1966400	going to look at you funny some people might might might throw a slur at you it shouldn't
1966400	1972560	happen it's disgusting i understand to act like that you are not the height of privilege despite
1972560	1978240	those things is quite frankly ridiculous about the bill 21 we must respect the constitution and
1978240	1982000	we won't interfere at the federal level that's the decision from the from the provincial government
1982000	1986960	and that's what we must do but also mr thing you said that you didn't want boom respect the
1986960	1992720	constitution don't interfere with the provinces at the federal level great i mean again i don't
1992720	1998640	really agree with with bill 21 either but that's the right answer for a federal leader that is the
1998640	2003280	right answer so you're for diversity but what about diversity of opinions i have the right
2003280	2007040	to have another opinion about immigration and i don't know why you're not you you're a leader
2007040	2010880	and you must be try to have everybody on your side but are you believing let me answer that
2010880	2013840	question are you going to be free speech only when people are saying things that you want to
2013920	2017280	here you're asking the part let me answer it after a couple minutes of this debate tonight i think
2017280	2020160	people can clearly see why i didn't think you should deserve a platform the comments that
2020160	2022880	you're making the type of things you say there's one thing to say that you disagree with somebody
2022880	2027920	that's fine but when you incite hatred no i don't it's not you cannot say that i just want to ask
2027920	2031360	about her mental stability it shows a lack of judgment you don't deserve a platform and i'm
2031360	2035120	happy to challenge you on that because your your ideas are hurtful to canada i will always work to
2035120	2041120	build unity and bring people together holy shit okay so because uh because maxime bernia talks
2041120	2044880	about living immigration because he talks about the negative effects of extreme multiculturalism
2044880	2048640	because he talks about the problems of non-integrative immigrants into canada
2049200	2055120	he's he's hurtful he hurts canada are you are you crazy there was there was a great debate on
2055120	2059600	whether or not to even invite maxime bernier and jagmeet's position is that he shouldn't have been
2059600	2065200	there there's no there's no reason to hold that position i mean let's say his ideas are as bad
2065200	2070000	as you think they are jagmeet surely you would be able to absolutely destroy them in a debate
2070560	2075520	you haven't this is a debate you can do it but you haven't you've just said that he's hurtful
2075520	2080720	you don't stop extremism by isolating it when you isolate it it goes into an echo chamber and
2080720	2087280	festers you stop it by debating it and showing other people who are watching the debate how
2087280	2093280	right you are and how wrong they are you're not willing to do this with maxime bernier because
2093280	2100240	you know that he would wipe the floor with you if you actually got down to comparing ideologies
2100240	2104640	and the effects of immigration you don't want to have that discussion which is why you didn't
2104640	2110960	want him at the debate in my opinion jagmeet you're a coward what is very dangerous is when
2110960	2115040	you have a prime minister like justin trudeau who uses legitimate issues like racism and hateful
2115600	2119360	hateful language to demonize anyone who disagrees with him calling people uncanadian for disagreeing
2119360	2123680	with his failure on the border thank you very much i'm sorry i mean he was cut off but he's
2123680	2128160	also right there are legitimate refugees from middle eastern nations and elsewhere who who
2128160	2133840	come to canada because they want to be canadian and inviting in the sharia types is only going to
2133840	2141120	make life harder for them not not easier they came here to escape the barbarism of their home country
2141120	2146320	we don't want to import that same barbarism thanks page and hey to ubc thank you i raise
2146320	2151120	my hands to musqueam swamish and slave with his territory see see it's all about who used to live
2151120	2155040	there we need fair voting we need to get rid of first past the post because it creates each
2155040	2160240	political party as rival warring camps even when the elections are over oh first past the post you
2160240	2164720	know uh justin trudeau ran on on getting rid of that and then he later turned around and said
2164720	2169520	that he wasn't going to do it remember that i did a video on it remember that it's really important
2169520	2173360	to recognize that yes we're in a time of polarization and differences that get highlighted
2173360	2176480	by the kind of debate going on at this stage and in this campaign about how we're moving forward
2176480	2180080	the reality is canadians agree on most things we want to raise our kids in that world that
2180080	2182480	is getting better for them we want to be able to pay for their future their futures we want
2182480	2185920	to be able to retire in in comfort we want to create opportunities for our neighbors as well
2185920	2189040	this is something that binds canadians together right around the country and the fact that there
2189040	2192880	is a politics of fear and division that is continuing to dominate here uh underlies uh
2192880	2196960	what we're actually doing thank you very much it's it's not politics of fear and division
2196960	2202400	because those things that you mentioned justin that all canadians want and i agree i think most
2202400	2209120	canadians want those things um you can't do that with open borders the welfare state cannot support
2209120	2214240	hundreds of thousands of immigrants flooding in and taking out from a system they didn't pay into
2214800	2218960	it's just it's just the it's just the math of it we are a successful country but we are not
2218960	2224000	successful enough that we can support the entire world's poor and i'm not a racist for saying that
2224960	2229360	it's it's just the numbers it's the truth speaking about immigration it is not polarization
2229360	2235440	actually canada receive more more immigrants per capita than any other western countries three
2235440	2239600	times higher than the u.s so we must have a discussion about that it is the equivalent of
2239600	2243920	one nova scotia every three years like the population of nova scotia every three years
2243920	2248320	here in canada so you know they are for mass immigration and for a sustainable immigration
2248320	2252560	and that's why we must have fewer immigrants a maximum of 150 000 a year with more economic
2252560	2256720	immigrants for our country seems completely reasonable nothing about that was racist he
2256720	2260800	didn't mention a single race or a single location from where the immigrants are coming from he
2260800	2265920	didn't even mention a single ideology although in my opinion the the the biggest problem is competing
2265920	2270720	ideologies incompatible ideologies flooding into canada he just talked about the economic realities
2270720	2275920	of the numbers and it was a completely reasonable thing to say mr trudeau you broke ethics laws twice
2275920	2279600	you interfered in an ongoing criminal court proceeding you shut down parliamentary
2279600	2282720	investigations into your corruption and you fire the only two people in your caucus who
2282720	2286960	are speaking out against what you're trying to do just for telling the truth tell me when did
2286960	2292000	you decide that the rules don't apply to you oh this will be something that i bring up in that
2292000	2300800	video by the way that upcoming video uh trudeau's corruption the snc scandal oh god i i can't go into
2300800	2307120	it now guys but you will see and i think this might be the thing that at the very least make
2307120	2311440	ensures that trudeau does not get a majority government this time around mr shear the role
2311440	2314400	of a prime minister is to stand up for canadian's jobs to stand up for the public interest and that's
2314400	2317440	what i've done and that's what i will continue to do every single day the way i have worked for
2317440	2320960	canadians is around investing in them unlike the vision that you're putting forward of giving tax
2320960	2324720	breaks that help people who are making 400 000 k a year 400 000 a year more than someone making
2324720	2330080	40 000 a year you're offering a 50 000 tax break which is more money than most canadians earn to
2330080	2333200	the wealthiest canadians with your plan of course we don't entirely know your plan because you
2333200	2336560	haven't released your costed platform yet which i think is a disrespect to every Canadian watching
2337520	2341440	you'll notice that he didn't say a single thing about the corruption or the the court case
2341440	2347840	currently going on didn't say a single thing pure dodge went completely back to talking points
2350480	2353280	you looked canadians in the eye and you said that the allegations in the global mail were false you
2353280	2356640	said jody wilson rayburn never came to you you said you never put pressure on her we now know
2356640	2360560	that those were all lies you have failed to tell the truth mr shear the responsibility of any prime
2360560	2363680	minister is to stand up for jobs and what you're saying is you wouldn't have done it the ceo of
2364480	2370240	you never threatened jobs or headquarters you are making that up again see complete dodge he talks
2370240	2375840	about specific he talks about specific people in specific publications specific articles talking
2375840	2381360	about what justin trudeau did the corruption didn't say a single thing about it justin trudeau
2381360	2386720	will never answer questions about about the snc scandal don't worry i'll talk about it someday
2386720	2389440	we're gonna save families money by investing in pharmacare for all which is gonna save families
2389440	2395520	over 500 a month we're gonna invest in child care which is gonna save families thousands of
2395520	2398160	dollars a month and we're gonna make sure that those families that earn less than 70 000 get
2398160	2402960	denticare that's gonna save families at least 1240 a month our taxpayers where will you where
2402960	2405440	will you find the money where will you find the money this is a conservative spin where we're
2405440	2408480	gonna find the money is this we're gonna ask the wealthiest canadians the wealthiest canadians
2408480	2411600	those who have wealth of over 20 million dollars those who have fortunes of over 20 million dollars
2411600	2414960	we're gonna ask them to pay a little more yes how do you prevent them from leaving the country
2415920	2419600	what if they say hey you know what i'm just going to take my 20 million dollars and go
2420400	2424720	and if that means that i i shut down a business in canada and bring it to the states or bring
2424720	2431520	it elsewhere then i'll do that what do you do then what do you do when all the high earners leave
2431520	2434480	it's the united nations declaration the right for indigenous peoples needs to come into force of law
2434480	2437760	in this country i know you oppose it because the debate we had at mcclean's but the reality of it
2437760	2440880	is section 35 of the constitution already requires consultation and it does not boil down to
2441440	2446080	the thing about the uh the un declaration of the rights of indigenous persons
2446800	2453760	is that it is it is largely considered unworkable in law the justice minister in 2016 said that
2453760	2457760	adopting the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples is unworkable
2458480	2461920	respectfully it is a political distraction to undertaking the hard work required to actually
2461920	2466080	implement it this un declaration really seems to be something that other uh other leaders
2466080	2471840	beat the current government with while knowing that it's not something that could actually work
2471840	2475040	in canadian law so what does free prior and informed consent mean for every single
2475040	2478480	indigenous community what about the dozens and dozens of indigenous communities who want these
2478480	2481520	projects why are you prepared to set aside the decision of the human rights tribunal to fight
2481520	2484720	it in court just as mr trudeau is when they actually found as a matter of fact that our
2484720	2488400	government committed acts that were reckless and willful in the violation of the rights of
2488400	2492960	indigenous children there are dozens of well let's be honest um i don't know exactly what she's
2492960	2498240	referring to here i'll have to look into it later but in general the human rights tribunal in canada
2498240	2505360	is a joke body they're the tribunal that prevented a guy from tweeting for three years because he
2505360	2510240	shit posted too hard i don't consider them legitimate i don't think they have any place in canada
2510800	2514880	you don't fear the idea of expropriating territories going into provinces and saying
2515520	2520480	the constitution yours not mine the constitution it is your constitution because quebec's part of
2520480	2527280	canada this this guy's ridiculous man this section is about about land treaties with
2527280	2533600	canada's first nations not quebec rights that's all that's what he turns it to is just the rights
2533600	2538720	of of people in quebec says that i have the right to go through provinces through quebec without
2538720	2542400	their approval and i remind you that's just the beccers and the prime minister said clearly
2542400	2547040	quebec isn't a prime minister because you're not a country perry belvard the grand chief of the uh
2547040	2550480	the head of the assembly of first nations has said that no government has done more for indigenous
2550480	2554000	peoples than this government and he's one of your constituents mr shear that's right he comes from
2554000	2561360	my little blackberry i have nothing to learn from mr trudeau who fired the first indigenous attorney
2561360	2565520	general for doing her job she said that she would do politics differently and you fired her when
2565520	2571440	she did see that's actually uh somewhat unrelated it's still a good point because trudeau did fire
2571440	2576320	somebody who was looking into into his corruption um at the same time the fact that she's indigenous
2576320	2582560	doesn't matter and this is just the tories trying to play the left's game of identity politics but
2582560	2586960	at the same time if that is the game i guess you have to play it nowadays you said that you're
2586960	2590880	ready for building pipelines all across this country by the private sector but at the same
2590880	2594960	time you said you know quebecers are ready to buy oil and gas from canada i agree with that i agree
2594960	2599200	that quebecers know that it's safer to transport oil and gas by pipelines than by trains but at the
2599200	2603600	same time the quebec government said that there's no social acceptability for a pipeline in quebec
2603600	2606720	what will be your position on that do you think that you'll be able to use the constitution
2606720	2610480	because after consultation if we don't have any agreement we must be able to use a constitution
2610480	2613920	section 9210 to be able to build a pipeline when you do that the federal government will have the
2613920	2616880	full authority the full jurisdiction to approve pipeline but what you're saying you're for
2616880	2620800	pipelines but you don't have the courage to use a constitution to be sure that we'll have pipelines
2620800	2624080	in this country for the unity of our country and the prosperity of our country that's just not the
2624080	2626800	case at all i've always said that the federal government must stand up for federal jurisdiction
2626800	2630480	we respect provincial jurisdiction and when you've got the best idea i am convinced that i can get
2630480	2635280	support for this project because quebecers know that it's better to take energy from western
2635280	2638160	canada than the tanker after tanker of foreign oil coming up to st lawrence or oil and gas coming
2638160	2640880	from donald trump's economy i know quebecers will support this project because it will also allow
2640880	2644000	them to share their hydro electrical power with other provinces as well see despite that little
2644000	2648800	jab at donald trump in the end when you get the two guys on the right actually talking about
2648800	2654000	policy it seems like there's a real discussion going on and it's not just mudslinging there was
2654000	2658000	a little bit of mudslinging you know you know uh maxime bernier telling andrew shear that he
2658000	2663360	he was too cowardly to use the constitution to ensure a pipeline gets built but in general
2663360	2667280	they're talking about policy and they're talking about specifics of policy and it's kind of
2667280	2671840	refreshing because it's not just ideology it's not just talking points they're actually talking about
2671840	2676880	a specific project that has been held up by the liberal government and how they would solve the
2676880	2682320	situation that's kind of refreshing to be honest even though i don't really agree with either their
2682320	2687840	solutions at least we're talking about something specific and not just ideals you know i went to
2688320	2691440	again just recently we've got a community impacted by mercury poisoning an indigenous activist went
2691440	2694720	to a private fundraiser where mr chuteau mocked that indigenous activist saying thank you for
2694720	2697760	your donation living with mercury poisoning because he's a fraud what kind of prime minister
2697760	2700640	does that i wish i had an answer but one that doesn't deserve to be re-elected
2702160	2707280	oh boy future video it's not a short-term project it is on us as settler canation settler canadians
2707280	2713520	to bring justice settler canadians that is how the greens at least i'm pretty sure most of the
2713520	2719280	radical left in canada but the greens at least view white people in canada not as canadians
2719920	2726720	as settler canadians they're they have to have this distinction where we're the settler canadians
2726720	2732320	and then the the aboriginals are i guess the the native canadians considering how much
2732320	2740640	fluff has been given about the politics of of divisiveness in this debate it is ridiculous
2740640	2746800	to use term like settler canadian i do not view myself as a settler canadian nor will i ever view
2746800	2751840	myself as a settler canadian i don't accept that label i don't even accept you know uh italian
2751840	2758320	canadian or or irish canadian or or newfoundlander i'm a canadian and that's that no other leader
2758320	2762560	is ready to build a new relationship with our first nation they all support the status quo
2762560	2768560	but the system is broken we still have extreme poverty on reserve we need a bold reform and we
2768560	2773760	are the only party that will try to implement property rights on reserve and also establish
2773760	2779200	a new relationship based on self-reliance for these communities we need to build a new system
2779200	2783280	working with them but that's not what they want because we cannot fix the system right now if we
2783280	2788080	don't do a bold reform and we are ready for that this is what's interesting about this um those of
2788080	2795120	you who don't know how the first nations reserve system works in in canada is that all of the the
2795120	2800960	reserve property is communally owned which means that it's an it's basically owned by by the chiefs
2801840	2807600	of uh of that nation and and they're just funded by the government and so when a first nations
2807600	2813040	person lives in a house on a reserve they don't actually own the house they can't they can't sell
2813040	2819040	the house and you know on service it sounds good free housing great at the same time um
2820160	2824240	it also means that you don't have any kind of capital to leave you know if you wanted to sell
2824240	2828720	your house and move off reserve you can't do that because you don't own the house and so it ends up
2828720	2835280	being the case that like um there's a lot of alcoholism and drug problems on canada's reserves
2835280	2842400	they are in fact under a lot of uh boil water advisories um the the conditions on them are
2842400	2848640	appalling and at the same time the people who live there they seem to largely have no desire
2848640	2853040	to actually help themselves but not only no desire but also no ability to help themselves because
2853120	2857600	they don't own any property they can't really you know get off the reserve at least some of them do
2857600	2862960	some of them have you know because there are also um there are also subsidies that come through
2863520	2867440	the the the the reserve system to allow people to go to school and they pay for part of their
2867440	2872640	tuition so they can in fact leave the reserve but man when they leave the reserve they don't go back
2873280	2877040	they go to like a canadian city and they work a regular job and they own a house themselves
2877040	2880160	people who are stuck on the reserve they're they're stuck there and they can't leave
2880160	2884800	and they don't really have anything a lot of stuff is just provided to them so it's become
2884800	2890000	this this negative feedback loop where the government is willing to provide for them based
2890000	2897200	on various uh treaty rights and based on the fact that um unlike in the united states canada's first
2897200	2901840	nations were never really conquered in a sense so in the past there was this sense of allowing the
2901840	2908000	first nations to live as they like in this reserve system however you know to be to be quite frank
2908000	2912720	and open about it european technology was always significantly more advanced than than first
2912720	2918640	nations technology and so when canada modernized and became you know a regional power and and
2918640	2924400	became a world economic power in a sense and you know became one of one of the g8 and a first world
2924400	2929680	nation and the whole bit um the first nations still living traditional lives were like well
2929680	2934000	what the hell like aren't we part aren't we in canada too like how come we how come we're
2934000	2941040	subsisting off the land as canada transforms itself into into this great nation and so it
2941040	2946960	like there's it's become this limbo where the reserve system is broken it's not working the
2946960	2951520	first nations people living within the system are completely destitute and addicted to a number of
2951520	2956000	things but at the same time they're also very dependent on those handouts and it kind of goes
2956000	2962560	both ways in a sense where where they're both victims of of the environment and of the government
2962560	2968160	but also victims of themselves and each other it's it is it is appalling that this kind of thing
2968160	2973200	happens in canada maxime bernie's solution here and he seems to be the only one who even talks
2973200	2980560	about it is to basically remove the reserve system and privatize the the property within so that
2980560	2985920	people actually own property now on the one hand that would be what helps them like fundamentally
2985920	2992000	it would be at this on the other hand um it would completely destroy not only the reserve system but
2992000	2997920	large parts of of uh of native culture and they don't want that and i understand that they don't
2997920	3004720	want that but it's like you know you you can live a modern lifestyle or you you can't and if you
3004720	3010160	can't you can't complain that you're not living a modern lifestyle this halfway half-assed solution
3010160	3016800	of the reserve system uh is ruining the native population in canada it's terrible but but but
3016800	3021600	the solutions are to to go backwards and live how they used to live before europeans uh showed up
3021760	3026000	which is no good frankly like do you really want to do that if you're native and listen to this
3026000	3029600	do you really want to do that do you really want to live without all modern conveniences
3029600	3033280	and you want to live how your ancestors lived do you think you would survive a canadian winter
3033280	3038080	like that maybe you would maybe some of you would you know but let's be honest here do you want to
3038080	3042240	go without internet do you want do you want to go without all modern conveniences of life do you
3042240	3048480	want to go without individual um human rights and all of the philosophical and political advances
3048480	3052160	that european contact brought i know it brought a lot of terrible things but it also brought a lot
3052160	3058880	of good things or do you want to join modern canada which by necessity means that you you
3058880	3063520	you have to have private property and not have and not depend on government handouts there is no good
3063520	3068240	answer to that even asking the question will get people angry at me and will make people offended
3068240	3073120	and will probably get me labeled as a bigot and i commend maxime burnier you know another reason
3073120	3077680	for them to call him a racist but he's actually asking a proper question and putting forward an
3078160	3082320	imperfect solution but it's better than anything that anybody else wants to do the science is clear
3082320	3086160	your target is a commitment to failure that's why it's so doable and achievable because it doesn't
3086160	3090720	do what the ipcc says we must do we must go off fossil fuels as quickly as possible and you bought
3090720	3095200	a pipeline you can't be a climate leader and spend 10 to 13 billion dollars more on a project that by
3095200	3101600	itself blows through our carbon budget consider elizabeth may's uh rhetoric the green party rhetoric
3102320	3108240	trudeau's plan is doable because it won't do anything is the implication that what we need
3108240	3114800	to do to to solve the the the climate crisis if it is as you describe is the implication that
3114800	3122880	what needs to be done is not doable because if that's the case then we're fucked anyway so what
3122880	3126960	does it matter people must know that that mr shear and mr trudeau you're the same on climate change
3126960	3130480	you want to impose a carbon tax on canadians and you want to impose more costly regulation
3130480	3133120	i think that's the most offensive thing you said all night max we're the same on climate change
3133120	3138160	you want to impose also a big tax so you're the same on climate change and you won't be able to
3138160	3144400	achieve your target he hasn't said anything offensive that's the most offensive thing you've
3144400	3150640	said all night max is it i mean maybe it is but he hasn't really said much in a way that's been
3150640	3157440	offensive i know that these guys are desperate to to paint maxime burnier as as this white supremacist
3157440	3162080	or something but it's getting pretty desperate you know the way to bring more public service
3162080	3166800	to bring more help to canadians child care banning tuition investing in post-secondary education
3166800	3180480	pharma care in bet banning tuition um i what happens to colleges then i mean part of the value
3180480	3188320	of of of a college diploma or a university degree is that not everyone has them it sounds kind of
3188320	3194480	harsh i know but it is the truth it is the truth of the matter you can't just ban tuition look at
3194480	3200880	your platform elizabeth and you know you will spend 60 billion dollars spending won't create any wealth
3200880	3205280	you cannot spend your way to prosperity we need to have more private sector investment and at the end
3205280	3209520	you know you know that our national credit card is full did you see her laugh there hold on i'm
3209520	3215440	going to go back look at her laugh when he says here hold on billion dollars spending won't create
3215440	3220000	any wealth you cannot spend your way to prosperity we need to have more private sector investment
3220000	3225280	and at the end you know you know that see she she laughs at the idea that you can't spend your way
3225280	3231680	to wealth and i mean that is that is essentially uh the truth i mean yeah like in terms of
3231680	3235600	businesses you have to spend money to make money you have to invest and and you know buy buy
3235600	3241840	supplies and you know shit like that i understand that but she's laughing at the idea that
3241840	3247520	governments can't spend their way to having a prosperous nation and no they can't because
3247520	3251360	governments aren't in the business of doing business and i don't think she understands
3251360	3256800	this because frankly she's a she's a communist and and that smile there is from somebody who
3256800	3265840	who doesn't understand economics i guess so our national credit card is full we still have
3265840	3270800	deficit and mr tudo just had 70 billion dollars on our debt and you'll have another 60 billion
3270800	3274400	dollars on our debt it is not responsible our children will have to pay for that but you have
3274400	3277760	you have your famous private sector having got massive tax cuts when you were in mr harper's
3277760	3280480	cabinet based on being told these were the job creators and it would be great when they got tax
3280480	3283920	cuts they have not invested in the economy they're sitting on piles of cash mark carney calls it the
3284000	3289120	money we need to get that money and do public sector infrastructure so they're just scrooge
3289120	3294720	mcducking it is that what it is they have they have big vaults of money that they swim around in
3296160	3301680	i don't think that's what um that's what what the hardcore capitalists do now because it was
3301680	3305120	she's talking about steven harper's government what the hardcore capitalists did in steven
3305120	3309200	harper's government was take that money and then move it out of canada because they were
3309200	3312640	they were multinationals they were globalists and that's something that maxime bernier
3312640	3317200	does not like he talks about wanting to fight that in his platform so so this really is the
3317200	3322080	problem with somebody who who is a socialist or is a communist is that they don't see an
3322080	3327920	ideological difference between somebody who is a capitalist globalist and somebody who is a
3327920	3334320	capitalist nationalist they just see capitalist and stop thinking right there our universal tax
3334320	3337840	cut will mean 850 in the pocket of a hard-working average income canadian we're going to bring back
3337840	3341120	the children's fitness tax credit to make raising children more affordable we're going to bring back
3341120	3344400	the green public transit tax credit to make taking the bus or the train more affordable as well we're
3344400	3347280	going to help fight climate change by bringing in the green home renovation tax credit which will
3347280	3349840	put money in the pockets of canadians and help lower emissions and we're going to pay for that
3351840	3355360	the way we're going to pay for those is by cutting corporate welfare and reducing canada's foreign
3355360	3359040	aid budget by 25 so we're going to stop sending money to the relatively well-off countries we're
3359040	3362160	going to bring that money back home so that canadians can get ahead mr share that may be
3362160	3365840	the worst idea in your whole non-platform is the cutting of foreign aid i wear this little pin this
3365840	3368800	is sustainable development goals the united nations to which this country is committed
3368800	3372640	ending poverty within the next decade within canada and globally is actually possible but not
3372640	3375280	if we ever had the misfortune of having your i believe you should take that money and bring it
3375280	3381680	back home greedy and selfish policies hold on a minute hold on a minute so shears shear's plan
3381680	3386320	is to not just tax the one percent you know to be fair i don't i don't believe that uh shear will
3386320	3390640	ever tax the one percent even though he says he it's part of his platform i just don't think he
3390640	3396640	will but he says he's gonna he's gonna start cutting canadian foreign aid why not if if
3396640	3402000	canada's first nations are living under boil water advisories if we have homeless people here
3402000	3405760	if we're cutting social programs and we're cutting education why are we still sending
3406400	3411440	money overseas yeah sure those countries are are also not well off and they probably deserve some
3411440	3415440	help but i mean one a lot of them are corrupt and the money doesn't go to actually helping the
3415440	3420640	people and two we have our own people to deal with first it's it's it's the same ideology as
3420640	3426800	the open borders people we can't take care of everyone and our priority is canadians if federal
3426800	3432080	government was to respect jurisdiction of provinces it would take less time it would cost less money
3432080	3436000	and provinces and quebec could do what they have to do about health care bring the money that is
3436000	3440160	owed to quebec and provinces this is what has to be done lodging the money the money should be
3440160	3445920	see it's it's always quebec and provinces as if they are two separate entities quebec is a
3445920	3449360	province we recognize that we need to help people more directly that's why the first thing we did
3449360	3452080	was lower taxes for the middle class and raise them on the wealthiest one percent we're moving
3452080	3456400	again forward with a tax break for low and middle income canadians and nothing for the wealthiest
3456400	3459760	unlike mr shear's universal tax credit we're also moving forward by increasing the canada child
3459760	3463200	benefit which has lifted hundreds of thousands of families out of poverty by fifteen percent for
3463200	3466800	kids under one we're increasing the old age security for seniors over 75 we're making sure
3466800	3469760	that students have an easier time paying back their student debts by not having to pay back
3469760	3473040	until they're making thirty five thousand dollars a year we're investing in canadians mr trudeau
3473040	3479120	thank you mr bernier your turn man look at how quickly he just rattles those off that is pure
3479120	3484880	rehearsed talking points and the honest truth is there's there's not much substance in those
3484880	3489520	those numbers are are kind of iffy at best the few numbers that he actually did provide
3509120	3515840	canadian under my watch that was the only uh good thing trudeau said the entire the entire debate
3515840	3520320	mr shear you said in english a few months ago that you were strongly against the very idea of
3520320	3524320	bill 21 about laicity of the state in quebec then you said in french in quebec that you would do
3524320	3530000	nothing against that law but your very close collaborator mr allen reyes said the day before
3530000	3535200	yesterday that you would protect the bill 21 he said that in french i must admit you would you
3535200	3539360	were the only one that would protect the bill can you get to the question please how will you do that
3539360	3542480	it's very uh this the answer to this question is very simple mr blanchette and you know that i've
3542480	3545680	always been very clear on this issue we will not intervene in the court case that is currently
3545680	3549040	before the courts uh the elected officials of quebec have taken this decision and now it is
3549040	3553120	before the courts and the courts and the courts will protect protect the law that is exactly what
3553120	3556640	we said in english and in french it's very important that a federal government respects
3556640	3560000	and protects individual liberties and individual human rights we will not pursue this court of
3560000	3563680	action at a federal level but mr shear has the floor in the law it's quite simple i just
3563840	3571440	this happens a few times in this debate uh going forward where people just keep re-asking sheer
3571440	3575440	a question and he says i just answered it like what are you talking about and in this case he did
3575440	3580160	he said that he personally disagrees with bill 21 which is something we talked about much earlier
3580160	3587040	in the debate but he will uh he will not uh use the use the federal powers to block it which i
3587040	3592640	think is is a reasonable is a reasonable position to hold but rather than listen to that answer or
3592640	3597440	respond to it um his opponent just asks the question again this is something that the federal
3597440	3600800	level we will not pursue the conservative party has always stood for individual liberty for
3600800	3603360	fundamental human rights it was a conservative prime minister that brought forward the bill
3603360	3607440	of rights the last prime minister from saskatchewan except you won't defend a woman's right to choose
3607440	3611920	you you've dismissed lgbt lgbt protections you haven't apologized for your words
3611920	3618640	millions millions millions years ago will you okay okay so as i said they're they're gonna do it to
3618640	3624080	share again where first of all i don't i don't justin i don't think it's your place to bring up
3624080	3630080	things that happened years ago i i really don't think it's your place to bring up things that
3630080	3635920	happened years ago and ask for somebody to apologize for them will you recognize and
3635920	3639920	apologize for that millions of canadians have a different position on this issue and like millions
3639920	3644080	of canadians i am personally pro-life it is okay in this country to have a difference of opinion
3644880	3652720	canadians need to know one at a time please one at a time the laws and access on this issue have
3652720	3655360	not changed for 30 years under liberal prime ministers under conservative prime minister
3659360	3662480	now you probably couldn't hear that because they were just uh shouting over top of each other
3664000	3669440	but shear said he's personally pro-life and despite that the laws on abortion in canada
3669440	3675280	have not changed for 30 years um it's not it's not a court case like it is in the states with
3675280	3680560	roe v wade and he does not plan to disrupt the status quo despite his personal position
3680560	3687200	of being pro-life he does not want things to change as they are in canada and you know what
3687200	3691520	that doesn't matter because they just keep asking him over and over and over and over and over
3691520	3695200	will you respect a woman's right to choose will you respect a woman's right to choose
3695200	3698400	and he he's answered he just answered it but they don't want to listen to him see check it out
3699680	3703680	you have been not let's allow mr you're signing the nomination papers
3709600	3713440	nobody can nobody can hear what you're saying anymore and of course at this point it devolves
3713440	3718640	into a shit show and it's a whole bunch of virtue signaling and playing identity politics because
3718640	3723600	even though shear's not the greatest candidate he has some things going for him and at the same
3723600	3727600	time he also does resort to identity politics when because he knows that that's the game that's
3727600	3731680	currently being played right now into larger political discussion at the same time uh check
3731680	3738080	out maxime burnier's face here he is just so fed up with this nonsense like check it out we'll be
3738080	3746000	signing the nomination this is this is a man who knows this is an absurd discussion and has
3746000	3749840	checked out of the stupidity it's our next theme we've already talked about it a little bit but
3749840	3754560	now we will for real the environment and energy and we will talk about it a little bit half of
3754560	3759600	the entire thing so far has been about the environment and energy and i believe we live
3759600	3763440	in an age of climate crisis and this is the last election we have before a point of no return is
3763440	3772560	reached furthermore holy shit dude i i'm pretty sure that it's not quite that dire all right
3773440	3778960	i'm not saying it doesn't exist i just don't think that we're we are not headed for the barbecue you
3778960	3782480	know in the next few years or anything as mr blanchett said quebec and other provinces like
3782480	3785680	bc have moved forward with putting a price on pollution we've ensured that that price is put
3785680	3789120	in right across the country because it is a mechanism that will both lower emissions and
3789120	3793120	ensure that canadians can afford this transition the choice tonight is very clear between two
3793120	3797200	parties that have very different views see he didn't really answer the question before moving on
3798080	3805520	the the question was most businesses view the the carbon tax as just a price they have to pay
3805520	3811120	to enter into a marketplace and trudeau says yeah we've made the carbon tax um nationwide
3812800	3815920	yeah but that's not an answer to the question justin i don't know if you've noticed that's
3815920	3820400	how he handles a lot of things he spends maybe 15 seconds sidestepping a question and then the
3820400	3824320	rest of his time talking about talking points first of all we want to do things that are
3824320	3828400	possible we want to do things that are possible to protect our health our hair our environment
3828400	3832880	our water all the other leaders claim to save the world and to save the climate they cannot
3832880	3839280	canada represent only to 1.6 percent of the green gas emission there you go an actual figure canada
3839280	3846240	represents 1.6 of greenhouse gas emissions how do we stop climate change as canadians well it
3846240	3852640	seems like it might be a bit out of our control and also if we're only representing 1.6 while
3852640	3857680	places like the united states china and india represent in the double digits maybe we're
3857680	3861920	actually pulling our weight already maybe we're actually doing our share and they claim also to
3861920	3866240	be able to achieve the paris accord target they cannot they have to impose a carbon tax of 300
3866480	3870000	to do that and they won't do it they don't do it they're hypocrites we won't
3870000	3876560	have attacks on carbon there you go just straight up you're hypocrites refreshing to hear in a
3876560	3880800	debate i mean he might even be wrong about some things but at least he's willing to tell the truth
3880800	3885920	as he sees it and and not resort to talking points you know i'll i will take that respect for the
3885920	3889360	viewer now while mr trudeau has said a lot of nice things let's look at what he's done he said that
3889360	3892720	he's for the environment but then he continues to exempt the biggest polluters from his price on
3892720	3895920	pollution he says he wants to fight the climate crisis what does he do he continues to subsidize
3895920	3900240	oil and gas massively he says he's a climate leader what does he do he buys a pipeline
3900240	3906000	there's a big gap between what mr trudeau says and what he does yep have to agree with jagmeet again
3906000	3911520	um i don't like him as a candidate he seems like a good guy i don't like him as a candidate
3911520	3918080	but uh when he talks about the hypocrisy of trudeau he has his facts down you unlike everyone
3918080	3921680	else on this stage clearly understand that we're up against a real climate emergency the
3921680	3925920	intergovernmental panel on climate change has given us hard timelines challenging targets if
3927280	3931680	we've been given those hard timelines and challenging targets before may um i remember
3931680	3937040	being in the 90s and listening to the fact that by the year 2000 we'll be underwater
3937760	3942080	and society will have been destroyed we're still here when justin trudeau took office there were
3942080	3946720	three major pipeline projects ready to go under his watch all of them have failed he had to take
3946720	3950480	4.5 billion dollars of canadian tax money to put the trans mountain pipeline on life support and
3950480	3954480	he did that by sending 4.5 billion dollars of taxpayers money to another country to the
3954480	3958400	united states to be invested in the oil and gas sector there instead of here in canada his answer
3958400	3962640	for his rationale for having two campaign planes was that he bought carbon offsets which is just
3962640	3970400	a thing that privileged people can do that's right trudeau has two campaign planes flying around i
3970400	3976160	mean i don't know why he can just if he needs to go places as prime minister i understand you have
3976160	3981440	a plane why do you need two you can't fit can't fit everything on one plane we must double our
3981440	3984800	current target we must listen to science we must not build the trans mountain pipeline it's not
3984800	3988720	the last because it gets cancelled if we're serious you can't negotiate with physics you
3988720	3991440	can't as prime minister you can't just leave a leader of the liberal party there's a carbon
3991440	3995520	budget it doesn't budge and that's why it's so heartbreaking for me to look at you today and
3995520	3998400	know you could have done so much more the last four years please god you don't get a majority
3998400	4002240	this time around from the rockies from the rockies to the bay of fundy conservative premiers have
4002240	4005200	gotten elected on promises to do nothing on climate change and we need a strong federal
4005200	4008320	government to fight them to make sure that we are moving forward on protecting the future
4008320	4013280	generations from the impacts of climate change see this this argument here between uh may and trudeau
4014080	4021440	it sounds it sounds like the uh the establishment leftist arguing with the ideologue and saying
4021440	4025280	you know please keep supporting me i have the best you've got and the ideologue saying no you're not
4025280	4028880	pure enough from correct first would you agree with the demand of the prime minister of quebec
4028880	4033040	mr lugo that quebec review and environmental issues will have precedence over canada's
4033040	4036400	overview second question do you promise after this judgment in british columbia
4036400	4042560	do not ever try to have a pipeline cross quebec ever after 10 years of mr harper's failures to
4042560	4045600	get things built because he did not understand you have to work with indigenous peoples you have to
4045600	4049040	work with local communities you have to respect environmental science we brought in a process that
4049040	4053040	does exactly that and we work with the provinces on ensuring that there's not a duplication of
4053040	4056960	environmental environmental oversight that's what bill c69 is all about we know that the way we move
4056960	4063280	forward is responsible and will be done and that's the time mr trudeau no answer who's surprised
4063920	4068080	also you know i've said this a few times now so maybe i'm just maybe just sound like a broken
4068080	4073280	record but uh the block guy really does talk like quebec is this separate country entering into
4073280	4078720	negotiations with canada no man no it's never going to happen mr trudeau it's now your chance
4078720	4082800	to ask a question of any other leader you have one minute to do so sir we cut taxes for small
4082800	4087040	businesses to nine percent uh we cut taxes for canadians we know that tax breaks for wealthy
4087040	4090800	do not work to grow the economy 10 years of mr harper's failure has done that yet mr shear's
4090800	4094240	platform what we've seen of it because most of it is still secret and will remain secret apparently
4094240	4098640	like doug ford that doesn't work out so well for ontarians um is to reduce taxes for the wealthiest
4098640	4103120	canadians the multi-millionaires by 50 000 which is more money than most canadians wrap it up
4103120	4107760	why the 50 000 you have one minute to respond mr shear there was there wasn't really a question
4107760	4115040	in there what's there yeah justin when when you're given a chance to ask another candidate
4115040	4119600	a question that's not doesn't mean you just shit on him for 30 seconds you actually ask him a
4119600	4125440	question so mr trudeau you seem to be oddly obsessed with provincial politics there is a
4125440	4128880	vacancy for the ontario liberal leadership and if you are so focused on provincial politics go and
4128880	4134560	run for the leadership of that part of mr trudeau your tax policy has meant that 80 of canadian
4134560	4138960	families pay higher taxes today than when you first took office that is exactly true that was
4138960	4142800	a conservative principle that liberals fought against that you fought against your signature
4142800	4146720	achievement was taking a conservative idea to send support directly to downstairs i voted against
4146720	4151280	your tax hikes on canadians mr trudeau that's what i was voting is no i did not we are committed one
4151280	4154640	at a time we are committed to protecting that benefit because it is based on conservative
4154640	4157680	principle but we are going to go this is supposed to be mr shear's answer we're going to move into
4157680	4160560	open debate for all canadians with a universal tax cut we're going to bring back the children's
4160560	4163680	sports and fitness that's it mr shear we've got three minutes on this open debate starting with
4163680	4168400	me yes that's right sir okay mr shear you did not answer the question on why you are lowering taxes
4168400	4171840	by 50 000 for multi-millionaires in this country maybe you'll answer it tomorrow in the press
4171840	4174560	conference but you haven't answered it tonight that is just not true you haven't answered a
4174560	4179840	question your entire time as prime minister i've sat across you you okay that is true i can
4179840	4184880	definitely um when it comes to making that new video i will definitely put in the the montage of
4184880	4189680	trudeau literally ignoring everything if you think this is the first time he's done this ignoring
4189680	4196720	every single question no man this is this is mo andrew you are calling yourself a conservative
4196720	4200880	but you don't want to balance the budget in two years you will have 70 billion dollars on our debt
4200880	4204720	you support the cartel in meal dairy and poultry knowing that the canadian family is paying more
4204720	4210240	than 400 a year for that andrew are you a real conservative no i think you are a liberals why
4210240	4217920	are you pretending to be something that you are not you know maxime vernier hasn't done the best
4217920	4224480	in this debate it's been a lot of fiery rhetoric it's been a lot of shooting from the hip a lot of
4224480	4230720	truth telling in uh in a platform in a place where there's not much truth telling i mean look at this
4230720	4235200	look at this happy motherfucker right here he he gets it it's really unfortunate because this
4235200	4240720	debate has not really touched on the places where maxime vernier is at his strongest which is um
4240720	4246560	free speech and uh canadian nationalism canadian values let's talk about pretending to be something
4246560	4249760	that you're not i'm not sure which maxime vernier i'm debating tonight was it the maxime vernier from
4249760	4253040	the 1990s who was a separatist was it the maxime vernier who was minister responsible for handing
4253040	4257120	out corporate welfare was it the maxime vernier who defended supply management when it suited him
4257120	4259840	the fact of the matter is sorry it's my it's my time to respond to that question the fact of the
4259840	4263440	matter is there's a clear contrast in the selection justin trudeau's endless deficits and tax hikes to
4263440	4266480	pay for or a conservative plan that will leave more money in your pocket we will lower taxes
4266480	4270160	for all canadians we'll bring back popular tax credits like the kids sports and fitness tax credit
4270160	4274000	we'll boost the resp we'll raise the age credit for seniors and we'll bring in a green home
4274000	4277920	renovation tax credit that all the while cutting corporate welfare and canada's foreign aid budget
4277920	4281280	to bring that money back home so that canadians can get ahead nine seconds well let's do open
4281280	4285360	debate off you go you're starting that too thank you very much i'm the maxime vernier who's there
4285360	4291200	for canadians and i'm the maxime vernier who does not care about having real debates on real issues
4291200	4296880	that are important for you don't want to have debates to help every canadian and abolishing
4296880	4300640	that cartel in supply management you don't want to be able to cut foreign aid you don't want to
4300720	4306880	cut foreign it's precisely not the case we've said that i've said that we will cut canada's
4306880	4310560	foreign aid budget by 25 to pay for the tax cuts that we can save five billion dollars there and
4310560	4313680	balancing the budget what this election is all about this election is all about who's
4313680	4318160	going to fight for you who's going to stand up for you okay see that see that okay so bernier
4318160	4323680	and shear get into it again and they have a discussion on the minutia of their policies
4323680	4329600	and it's an interesting discussion and then we got jagmeet's low iq intervention of this is
4329600	4332800	really about who's going to fight for you it's just a platitude it's just platitudes man
4334640	4340560	our price on pollution helps canadians more uh than removing it does okay see okay that was
4340560	4344720	interesting because she says yeah five seconds go that's kind of unfair that was a point that
4344720	4349600	needed more than five seconds to reply to so it makes sense that trudeau got a bit flustered there
4349600	4354080	at the end but you could tell he was like searching for the proper talking point and
4354080	4360480	they kind of mashed together because it it is all talking points with him it feels like
4360480	4366800	he didn't come here to actually have any kind of substantive discussion on these issues that's it
4366800	4369200	thank you that brings us to the end of this segment and to the end of this debate we want
4369200	4372080	to thank all of you of course for taking the time our questioners tonight and all of you for
4372080	4374960	watching live in person and on your various screens just a reminder as monsieur blanche
4374960	4378720	hinted at that french language debate is later on this week thursday at 8 p.m eastern on behalf
4378720	4385520	yep and that's useless uh because frankly uh fuck french maxime burnier's uh frankly massive social
4385520	4390960	media presence came up a few times in this debate and so i want to show you something along the
4390960	4397040	lines of what he he posts regularly this election will go down in history as the one where identity
4397040	4401440	politics went off the rails can we get back to debating policies this is an reply to the
4401440	4408320	official conservative party's um tweet that justin trudeau's next cabinet has racists misogynists
4409120	4413680	and conspiracy theorists in it he stands by all the maze and fire a single single one and i think
4413680	4419120	this can be best exemplified by that one bit where maxime burnier you know looked up at the sky shook
4419120	4427120	his head and then put his head down you know i i get it identity politics does not help anyone and
4427120	4433600	pretty much everyone there except maxime burnier um played on identity politics and of course we
4433600	4437520	would not uh and of course this wouldn't be a debate without a canadian flavored version of
4437520	4443680	somebody saying something over and over and over and over because saying it multiple times makes
4443680	4450080	it true i guess allowing maxime burnier on stage platforms white supremacy does it is maxime burnier
4450080	4456240	a a white supremacist are you sure about that nothing that he said in there sounds like white
4456240	4460320	supremacy to me he sound completely reasonable well maybe this is the white supremacy here
4460320	4465440	burnier promises to build border fences if he's elected prime minister he said we cannot be the
4465440	4471360	welfare state of the planet canada must look at look after its own citizens first and focus on
4471360	4476800	newcomers who bring economic value to the country he denounced mass immigration and extreme
4476800	4481360	multiculturalism saying these policies would lead to social conflicts and potentially violence
4481360	4484880	these ideas nothing to do with freedom his speech said but rather a very dangerous type of social
4484880	4490800	engineering he identified islamism or political islam as a threat to our values and way of life
4491760	4496640	and apparently half of respondents in a poll think immigration levels are too high well is
4496640	4502080	you wrong and is this racist to say i don't think it is i don't think it's white supremacist to to
4502080	4510560	to to point out that islamists um are basically cancerous to western liberal democracies they're
4510560	4516160	they're they're incompatible this is a lie based on the idea that all cultures cultures are equal
4516480	4521360	a lie destructive of our western liberal democratic heritage traditions and values
4521360	4527120	based on individual rights and freedoms where's the racism where's the falsehood a people's party
4527120	4531840	government would focus on religious minorities in majority muslim countries and members of
4531840	4537680	sexual minorities instead of refugees identified by the united nations what's the problem seriously
4537680	4546480	what's the problem what possible complaint could say the lgbtq uh community have uh against this
4546480	4552240	proposal if there are gay people fleeing muslim countries because they they will be killed for
4552240	4558240	being gay and they come to canada and they get a focus what's the problem is this white supremacy
4558240	4563520	maxine bernie vows to slash immigration impose a values test on newcomers a values test how
4563520	4568880	terrible but what's wrong with the values test both he personally and his party despises
4568880	4573280	prejudice in all forms but nonetheless they're going to break the taboo of immigration to canada
4573280	4577680	by forcing the conversation upon the country yeah see the idea of a values test seems completely
4577680	4583520	reasonable to me if you do not hold values that are in line with canadian values then why should
4583520	4589120	you come here maybe this is the white supremacy maybe we've finally found it former neo-nazi and
4589840	4594560	pagata canada official among the people's party party of canada signatories okay
4594560	4600480	you actually have an instance of potential white supremacy if a neo-nazi is showing up to maxine
4600480	4606800	bernie's political party okay there you go we found it oh apparently the party cut its ties
4606800	4611440	with him last month after his past involvement in the white nationalist movement came to light
4612240	4615920	while his position within the people's party of canada was unclear at the time the elections
4615920	4622560	canada forums disclose his role in registering the party okay so as soon as it became apparent
4622560	4629600	that there was a white supremacist they kicked him out is that not what you would want if if
4629600	4634800	you're going after the ppc for having white supremacists in it is this not exactly what
4634800	4638880	you would want to see what's the complaint there's a link here what does this say
4646400	4650640	man linked to neo-nazi group in the u.s no longer with the people's party of canada
4652000	4657360	is this not the appropriate response of course you have to know that uh tangible results will
4657360	4662240	never be enough um you know what would be better than all the white leaders congratulating jagmeet
4662240	4666320	on dealing with racism in the campaign actually coming up with a plan to deal with racism and
4666320	4671040	white supremacy and their platforms well it seems like the only person who's done that at least
4671040	4677680	publicly so far is maxime bernia by kicking a white supremacist out of his party now you don't
4677680	4684000	want to hear that you probably think he's the literal fucking devil but nonetheless look at
4684000	4689680	these replies here more like reverse racism those of us unfortunate enough to have been born white
4689680	4693760	always having to choose our words and apologize for policies and atrocities many generations ago
4693760	4700480	committed you know fair enough i am not responsible for anything people with my skin color did 100 or
4700480	4708240	200 years ago oh check out this reply no one likes you you you fucking showed him as this
4708240	4713840	debate gets going i want to be clear that mclean's harmful irresponsible decision to invite maxime
4713840	4721680	bernie is the story tonight yeah why was it harmful irresponsible is it because he actually
4721680	4727440	had a chance to put forward his idea listen if his ideas were actually dangerous um they would be
4728160	4733440	he would be blown off the stage and he wasn't that's kind of the point here is that you want
4733440	4738560	to de-platform people that you can't beat in a straight debate fascists don't deserve a place
4738560	4746640	on on the stage any stage but he's not a fascist seriously canes deserve the freedom to decide
4746640	4751840	no canes deserve freedom from fascism he's not a fascist fascist is not just people you disagree
4751840	4759760	with you idiots of course it comes from a joker dickbutt avatar but can't win on the on the debate
4759760	4765680	stage rig the debates that's how they do this shit man throughout the debates shear and bernie hammered
4765680	4769600	the theme of canada maxing out its credit card relatively unchallenged well it's because it's
4769600	4776320	true but debt to gdp is falling which is not really a related statistic uh public spending
4776320	4783600	can create growth no public spending it's private spending that creates growth public spending
4783600	4788960	creates a safety net that for people who who are say really hurting can kind of fall into and then
4788960	4793440	from there build themselves back up to self-sustainability public spending does not create
4793440	4800240	growth and we have a civilizational duty to fund a green new deal no we don't the green new deal
4800240	4804960	failed in the states because it wasn't even about the climate it was about pushing socialism here
4804960	4809920	i'll end our post-election discussion since this has mostly just been uh twitter stupidity
4809920	4814960	with this this is google trends all right what you'll notice is that during the debate
4815600	4822800	um the most searched term from people on google in canada was for the people's party of canada
4822800	4827440	more than the other uh either parties by a fair amount you know the the conservatives were up
4827440	4833440	there for a bit the the the greens were up there liberals and ndp both at the bottom
4834000	4838960	and then the people's party massive spikes man i don't even think maxine brand did a particularly
4838960	4843280	good job but something must have come about in that debate that resonated with people because
4843280	4848400	people were looking them up people were looking them up and here they are this this is uh during
4848400	4852880	during the the time of the debate in fact right here everyone's looking them up and then you'll
4852880	4859600	notice um they're consistently reasonably high between last night when the debate happened and
4859920	4865040	now you know they're they're in the top three they're contending now this is google search
4865040	4872480	terms not um not votes not projections but something happened that people said hey
4873280	4879280	let's look into these guys and all the provinces of canada there's no data on the three territories
4879280	4885040	of north but during this period of time from the beginning of the debate until now and every
4885040	4891120	province except saskatchewan all of all the five parties the people's party is the most searched
4892720	4900080	that's crazy just putting maxime burnier on stage even though he didn't do that well got him some
4900080	4906160	pretty crazy reach that's that's nuts now of course you don't know what kind of searches
4906160	4912720	these are these could be people who are negatively predisposed towards the people's party of canada
4912720	4917120	and they're searching for uh not necessarily reasons revolving around supporting them like
4917120	4922480	we don't know but at the very least their name has been put out there and i think this is exactly uh
4922480	4928000	why jagmeet objected and why a lot of people on twitter are saying that he's a racist he's a nazi
4928000	4932080	he's he's a bigot he's all these things he shouldn't have been platformed because they know
4932640	4938960	that even though he flubbed the uh even though he flubbed the debate there was something about what
4938960	4945280	he was saying that was resonating with people and so they would rather him have not had a platform
4945280	4951360	to say it at all to every single brain-dead idiot who thinks that maxime burnier shouldn't have been
4951360	4957760	allowed on the stage because of fighting fascists or whatever here's a copy of the canadian charter
4957760	4962640	of rights and freedoms let's discuss the fundamental freedoms of all canadian citizens
4962640	4967200	everyone has the following fundamental freedoms freedom of conscience and religion freedom of
4967200	4971280	thought belief opinion and expression including freedom of the press and other media of
4971280	4977120	communication freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association every single time that
4977120	4982720	you label anybody that you disagree with a fascist every single time that you say that people should
4982720	4988800	not be allowed to partake in public life because you don't like their politics every single time
4988800	4993680	you either implement state force and suppressing opinions you don't like or whine that the state
4993680	4999120	is not doing it this is what you're pissing on and if you have to wonder why so many people
4999120	5005360	oppose you nowadays this is it you can't win debates so instead you try to stop them
5005360	5010080	all right chums that's about it for me this video was over four hours long this is going to be a
5010080	5016000	shitty one to edit i'll get it out as soon as i can i finished it at about 4 p.m october 8th
5016000	5021120	i want to get it out sometime tonight still on october 8th hopefully i will and most importantly
5021120	5026560	of all i'm going to continue with the canada stuff leading up until the election unless
5026560	5032960	something major happens i will keep doing these videos on various aspects of canadian society
5032960	5038560	because there are things unfolding including what's going on with justin trudeau that i think
5038560	5044320	are worth talking about before the election hits on the 21st that's the plan i will see you guys
5044320	5046560	next time i love you
