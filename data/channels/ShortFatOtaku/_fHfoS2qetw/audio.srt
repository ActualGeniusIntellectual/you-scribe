1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Hey guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,960
A lot of you who've been watching our channel for a while have probably figured out that

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,260
we have used the same camera for the past six and a half years.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:15,420
It's a Canon HG-10, it's pretty reliable, it survives several house moves, we've filmed

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,080
outside in the winter with it, we've filmed on the go with it, and it's largely been a

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,420
pretty good camera.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,500
But it's finally starting to die, we recorded a session of Sonic Adventure 2 and it just

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,380
failed to record, I mean it showed us the red light saying it was recording but it didn't

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,200
actually record any of the footage to the hard drive.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,660
And we thought this might just be a random error with the camera not recording to its

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,980
hard drive so we tried playing a session of some Kirby games and that actually did record

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,400
but the truth of the matter is, it's just not reliable anymore, we can't be filming

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,540
stuff and then lose a whole session of something.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,060
So we're going to keep this camera as a backup but we actually got a new one in the mail

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,180
and thanks to everybody who made this possible, this is actually a very nice camera.

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,180
What's up?

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,180
You're actually awake.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
I've been awake for a while.

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,180
Here, take the scissors, do you want to open it?

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
Instead of me doing this myself?

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,180
Okay.

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Don't fucking break anything.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,180
I shall not.

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,180
Don't like stab the scissors through the box and then like ruin it.

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,180
You fucking ass.

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,660
Off to an amazing start.

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,780
I was already getting paranoid.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,660
Straight from Japan.

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
You should go downstairs and wake up Cam.

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,660
Fuck that.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,660
Actually the guy coming up the stairs to deliver actually woke me up.

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,660
Oh yeah?

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,660
Yeah.

34
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay so look at all this high quality paper that he packed it with.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,340
Each sheet is worth five dollars.

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,420
It says 1405 Canon V, sorry XA10, 00A34.

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
And then some Japanese.

38
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Random, random characters.

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,580
It's Japanese, you don't be a fucking racist.

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580
Well it's random to us.

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,580
Oh what's this?

42
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,580
Ah!

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,580
It just has a postcard.

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,780
You didn't write anything on the postcard but you sent it as a postcard from Japan.

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
Thanks Packer.

46
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Is that like the Himeji Castle?

47
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,780
I don't fucking know.

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
You want to go there one day?

49
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,780
Himeji?

50
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,780
It might actually be Himeji Castle.

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,260
You didn't even know what Himeji Castle is.

52
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,300
Yeah it was featured in New England Toys.

53
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,780
It was featured in Civilization V, that's how I know it.

54
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,780
I saw it first.

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,780
Value of bubble wrap, which we will pop later.

56
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Okay.

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Let's try and see where it's taped.

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Yeah.

59
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Just stab your scissors through it.

60
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,620
I thought that was the point, not stabbing it.

61
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,860
We did buy it used because it was like, I think what it was, it was like a store model,

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
you know?

63
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Like never actually used.

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,860
Transfer utility.

65
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
Video.

66
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Video.

67
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
Power cables.

68
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,420
Yes.

69
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
Amazing.

70
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,420
Dude, just fucking cables.

71
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,420
Looks like a lens cover or something.

72
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,100
No not a lens cover, it's what you put on the lens, like you attach it to, well I can't

73
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,820
put it on this fucking camera, but you attach it to the lens to make it work.

74
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,460
You guys see some kind of stand or?

75
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Battery charger I think.

76
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,420
Battery charger I think.

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,980
We can, you can unwrap these things and look at them.

78
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
I suppose I can.

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,100
What do you think we're here for?

80
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,980
The camera, not the accoutrements.

81
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,940
This is the audio module, I know what this is.

82
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,500
This is the audio module, and this, let's see if I can get a good picture of it.

83
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,180
You can put two mics in here, and the controls for them are right here, come on focus, focus

84
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,180
please.

85
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
There you go.

86
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,180
Perhaps we should use the new one.

87
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,940
And you can put the two mics, there's the controls for the two mics, and you can basically

88
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,380
have a miniature soundboard on the go, it's good for like on the go interviews, which

89
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,740
hopefully we'll be able to do one day.

90
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,740
Yeah, sure.

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,740
Let's go over here.

92
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,540
Yeah, I totally just said that.

93
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:59,260
You can also attach like a shotgun mic or a light to this fixture here, and also this

94
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,260
fixture here.

95
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,260
And now what's left in there Dave?

96
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:11,140
Um, looks like the battery pack, sorry, battery charger, and another power cable, very nice.

97
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
I wonder what the hell.

98
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,140
And another, dude, dude, look at our own, it has two pieces.

99
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,140
That's true, that's true.

100
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Every fucking power cable nowadays has two pieces.

101
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Another battery pack?

102
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Well, that's the remote.

103
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,140
It looks pretty similar.

104
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,140
Yeah, it's like identical to our, just in black, but it's identical to our other remote.

105
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,140
Oh, that black would look better.

106
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,140
The remote for the HG10s, that's identical.

107
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,140
This covers the battery upper use.

108
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,140
I wonder if like the remotes are compatible.

109
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Like if you use the HG10 remote, it'll actually trigger on the, on the XA10 camera.

110
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,140
I don't know.

111
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,140
They're very simple signals though.

112
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,140
Yeah, they are.

113
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,140
Probably.

114
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,140
A lot of remotes like from TVs work on their TVs, you know?

115
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Yeah.

116
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,140
Well, that's why universal remotes.

117
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Yeah.

118
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,140
I remember there was once a time when like I stuck my remote out a window of a place

119
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,140
I was at and I changed my neighbor's TV.

120
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,140
It was kind of funny.

121
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
Asshole.

122
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,140
See, I didn't have the same TV as him, but I had like a similar one and the remote was

123
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,140
compatible.

124
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Yeah.

125
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,140
Oh, you mean like it was the same brand?

126
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Yeah.

127
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:34,140
And as Dave struggles with his life, he will cut away to an ad from McDonald's.

128
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,140
And here is the Canon HG10.

129
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
It's slightly, no, no, I'm sorry.

130
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
I'm holding the HG10.

131
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,140
Dave's holding the XA10.

132
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,140
It is, um, it is slightly bigger.

133
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,140
Don't fucking break it already.

134
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,140
It is slightly bigger than the HG10.

135
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,140
It's longer, but it's otherwise like relatively the same size.

136
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:09,140
And the handle, once you get it on, will attach to the top like right here.

137
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,140
And that's sort of how you carry it around.

138
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,140
And then this attaches right there.

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,140
Once we get the cap off.

140
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,140
And that is the full Canon XA10 experience.

141
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,140
Check it out, check it out.

142
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Even this is wider.

143
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
It's also a touch screen, dude.

144
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Yeah, it's a touch screen.

145
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,140
It has two SD card slots if you wanted to use SD cards, but it also has an infrared

146
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,140
so you can shoot at night.

147
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Yes, it has an infrared switch.

148
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,140
And I've actually seen some infrared footage on YouTube for this thing.

149
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Me too.

150
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
It's pretty good.

151
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
It is.

152
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
It's pretty impressive.

153
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,140
Um, it has, shut up, a 64 gig hard drive.

154
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
The HG10 only has a 32.

155
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Um, but most importantly, it shoots in significantly higher quality.

156
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Well, 1080, compared to the 720 on this magnificent piece of machinery.

157
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:14,140
The HG10 could shoot in 720 or in full screen 1080, not in widescreen.

159
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:24,140
While this is a fully HD camera, and the quality of it is significantly better.

160
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,140
We were looking at other cameras as well.

161
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
There is, what is it called, the HGX10?

162
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Or the HGA10?

163
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:39,140
There was another camera that was basically this camera for a thousand dollars less.

164
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,140
A thousand dollars less, but it didn't have any hard drive space, it didn't have the audio

165
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,140
module, and it didn't have the touch screen, and it didn't have the infrared.

166
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
And we were like...

167
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,140
And then, hold on Dave, hold on.

168
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:58,140
And then it turned out that, um, you look at the XA20, the models that were more expensive

169
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:04,140
than the XA10, and it didn't have any hard drive space, it just had more SD card slots,

170
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
and it didn't have infrared.

171
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,140
And I'm like, how come these more expensive models are lacking features?

172
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:16,140
You know, I don't quite get the camera scene, but basically we decided that the XA10 was

173
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,140
the professional camera that we wanted.

174
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,140
It normally runs for about $2,700 in Canada, we managed to get it for $14, which is quite

175
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,140
nice, because it was technically used, but it was a store display model, so it was never

176
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,140
actually used, it was only unpackaged and put on a pedestal for a while.

177
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
So, it's pretty good.

178
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
It's pretty fucking awesome.

179
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Don't break it Dave.

180
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,140
Alright Dave, so do you want to actually...

181
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Let's turn it on and see how it looks.

182
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Okay, turn it on.

183
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
I actually already did, but...

184
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
I know, I heard the beat.

185
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
Check it out.

186
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
Camera model.

187
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,140
Camera model.

188
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Holy crap, that looks so much clearer.

189
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,140
Yeah.

190
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,140
There's the component and audio out if you wanted to watch it on your TV.

191
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,140
I'm hoping there's an HDMI hookup, it said that there was.

192
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,140
It's probably on this side, probably underneath Dave's hand or something.

193
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Because we want an HDMI output on this.

194
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,140
Yes, we want an HDMI.

195
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
There it is, okay.

196
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
I'm not opening that now because I'll drop it.

197
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,140
We do actually have some expansion plans for the show and it's going to require a camera

198
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,140
that has an HDMI out.

199
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
It's nice that it does.

200
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
Yes, this one did too.

201
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,140
The HG10 also had an HDMI out.

202
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
It's on where my fingers as well.

203
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,140
But we never actually ended up using it.

204
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,140
So this is how it actually records.

205
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
Let's see...

206
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,140
It took like 20 minutes.

207
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
Trying to figure it out.

208
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,140
It is like the simplest thing.

209
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Well, let's see if it's actually any better quality.

210
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
I guess you'll see in the video, but I don't fucking know.

211
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,140
We'll have to play back on something a little bigger than this.

212
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Okay, in any case, what we're going to do is we're going to shoot probably kind of like

213
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,140
how we did Mario Party 8 with the sound stuff.

214
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,140
We just kind of recorded a meaningless short series of goofy shit to see if the sound would

215
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,140
work.

216
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,140
Because if the sound didn't work, we were just going to check out the session.

217
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,140
It's not that big of a deal.

218
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,140
We're going to do the same thing with this camera.

219
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
We're probably going to record...

220
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:13,140
I think it'll be Mario Tennis with this camera just to see how it works.

221
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,140
And if we get everything set up properly, then you guys will see Mario Tennis.

222
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
And if not, then you guys won't see Mario Tennis.

223
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,140
In fact, if this camera that I'm holding fucks up, you won't even see this video.

224
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,140
So there's that.

225
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,140
We are going to keep the HG10 around as a backup because it still works like some of

226
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,140
the time.

227
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,140
It'll be nice to have like a second angle sometimes or whatever, just like as an auxiliary,

228
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
right?

229
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,140
But we're definitely switching over to the XA10 as our main camera.

230
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,140
We have shot a lot of footage on the HG10, so some videos will still be in lower quality

231
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,140
for a little while.

232
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,140
But we'll gradually make the switch over to the new camera.

233
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,140
In any case, I'm going to turn this off now and take it from Dave before he fucking breaks

234
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,140
something.

235
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
Goodbye.

236
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Thanks.

237
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Thanks.
