00:00.000 --> 00:01.360
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:01.360 --> 00:04.960
A lot of you who've been watching our channel for a while have probably figured out that

00:04.960 --> 00:09.260
we have used the same camera for the past six and a half years.

00:09.260 --> 00:15.420
It's a Canon HG-10, it's pretty reliable, it survives several house moves, we've filmed

00:15.420 --> 00:19.080
outside in the winter with it, we've filmed on the go with it, and it's largely been a

00:19.080 --> 00:20.420
pretty good camera.

00:20.420 --> 00:26.500
But it's finally starting to die, we recorded a session of Sonic Adventure 2 and it just

00:26.500 --> 00:32.380
failed to record, I mean it showed us the red light saying it was recording but it didn't

00:32.380 --> 00:35.200
actually record any of the footage to the hard drive.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.660
And we thought this might just be a random error with the camera not recording to its

00:39.660 --> 00:44.980
hard drive so we tried playing a session of some Kirby games and that actually did record

00:44.980 --> 00:50.400
but the truth of the matter is, it's just not reliable anymore, we can't be filming

00:50.400 --> 00:52.540
stuff and then lose a whole session of something.

00:52.580 --> 00:57.060
So we're going to keep this camera as a backup but we actually got a new one in the mail

00:57.060 --> 01:01.180
and thanks to everybody who made this possible, this is actually a very nice camera.

01:02.180 --> 01:03.180
What's up?

01:03.180 --> 01:04.180
You're actually awake.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.180
I've been awake for a while.

01:05.180 --> 01:07.180
Here, take the scissors, do you want to open it?

01:07.180 --> 01:09.180
Instead of me doing this myself?

01:09.180 --> 01:10.180
Okay.

01:10.180 --> 01:11.180
Don't fucking break anything.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.180
I shall not.

01:12.180 --> 01:16.180
Don't like stab the scissors through the box and then like ruin it.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.180
You fucking ass.

01:18.180 --> 01:21.660
Off to an amazing start.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.780
I was already getting paranoid.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.660
Straight from Japan.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.660
You should go downstairs and wake up Cam.

01:28.660 --> 01:33.660
Fuck that.

01:33.660 --> 01:36.660
Actually the guy coming up the stairs to deliver actually woke me up.

01:36.660 --> 01:37.660
Oh yeah?

01:37.660 --> 01:38.660
Yeah.

01:38.660 --> 01:43.000
Okay so look at all this high quality paper that he packed it with.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.340
Each sheet is worth five dollars.

01:47.340 --> 01:54.420
It says 1405 Canon V, sorry XA10, 00A34.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.420
And then some Japanese.

01:55.420 --> 01:56.420
Random, random characters.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.580
It's Japanese, you don't be a fucking racist.

01:59.580 --> 02:00.580
Well it's random to us.

02:00.580 --> 02:01.580
Oh what's this?

02:01.580 --> 02:02.580
Ah!

02:02.580 --> 02:03.580
It just has a postcard.

02:03.580 --> 02:06.780
You didn't write anything on the postcard but you sent it as a postcard from Japan.

02:06.780 --> 02:07.780
Thanks Packer.

02:07.780 --> 02:08.780
Is that like the Himeji Castle?

02:08.780 --> 02:09.780
I don't fucking know.

02:09.780 --> 02:10.780
You want to go there one day?

02:10.780 --> 02:11.780
Himeji?

02:11.780 --> 02:12.780
It might actually be Himeji Castle.

02:12.780 --> 02:14.260
You didn't even know what Himeji Castle is.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.300
Yeah it was featured in New England Toys.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.780
It was featured in Civilization V, that's how I know it.

02:19.780 --> 02:20.780
I saw it first.

02:20.780 --> 02:23.780
Value of bubble wrap, which we will pop later.

02:23.780 --> 02:24.780
Okay.

02:24.780 --> 02:27.780
Let's try and see where it's taped.

02:27.780 --> 02:28.780
Yeah.

02:28.780 --> 02:31.780
Just stab your scissors through it.

02:31.780 --> 02:35.620
I thought that was the point, not stabbing it.

02:35.620 --> 02:40.860
We did buy it used because it was like, I think what it was, it was like a store model,

02:40.860 --> 02:41.860
you know?

02:41.860 --> 02:43.860
Like never actually used.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.860
Transfer utility.

02:46.420 --> 02:47.420
Video.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.420
Video.

02:48.420 --> 02:49.420
Power cables.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.420
Yes.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.420
Amazing.

02:51.420 --> 02:52.420
Dude, just fucking cables.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.420
Looks like a lens cover or something.

02:55.420 --> 02:59.100
No not a lens cover, it's what you put on the lens, like you attach it to, well I can't

02:59.100 --> 03:02.820
put it on this fucking camera, but you attach it to the lens to make it work.

03:02.820 --> 03:06.460
You guys see some kind of stand or?

03:06.460 --> 03:07.460
Battery charger I think.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.420
Battery charger I think.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.980
We can, you can unwrap these things and look at them.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.980
I suppose I can.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.100
What do you think we're here for?

03:17.100 --> 03:18.980
The camera, not the accoutrements.

03:18.980 --> 03:23.940
This is the audio module, I know what this is.

03:23.940 --> 03:29.500
This is the audio module, and this, let's see if I can get a good picture of it.

03:29.500 --> 03:35.180
You can put two mics in here, and the controls for them are right here, come on focus, focus

03:35.180 --> 03:36.180
please.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.180
There you go.

03:37.180 --> 03:39.180
Perhaps we should use the new one.

03:39.180 --> 03:43.940
And you can put the two mics, there's the controls for the two mics, and you can basically

03:43.940 --> 03:47.380
have a miniature soundboard on the go, it's good for like on the go interviews, which

03:47.380 --> 03:48.740
hopefully we'll be able to do one day.

03:48.740 --> 03:49.740
Yeah, sure.

03:49.740 --> 03:50.740
Let's go over here.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.540
Yeah, I totally just said that.

03:52.540 --> 03:59.260
You can also attach like a shotgun mic or a light to this fixture here, and also this

03:59.260 --> 04:00.260
fixture here.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.260
And now what's left in there Dave?

04:02.260 --> 04:11.140
Um, looks like the battery pack, sorry, battery charger, and another power cable, very nice.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.140
I wonder what the hell.

04:14.140 --> 04:18.140
And another, dude, dude, look at our own, it has two pieces.

04:18.140 --> 04:20.140
That's true, that's true.

04:20.140 --> 04:24.140
Every fucking power cable nowadays has two pieces.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.140
Another battery pack?

04:26.140 --> 04:27.140
Well, that's the remote.

04:27.140 --> 04:29.140
It looks pretty similar.

04:29.140 --> 04:32.140
Yeah, it's like identical to our, just in black, but it's identical to our other remote.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.140
Oh, that black would look better.

04:35.140 --> 04:37.140
The remote for the HG10s, that's identical.

04:37.140 --> 04:39.140
This covers the battery upper use.

04:39.140 --> 04:40.140
I wonder if like the remotes are compatible.

04:41.140 --> 04:46.140
Like if you use the HG10 remote, it'll actually trigger on the, on the XA10 camera.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.140
I don't know.

04:48.140 --> 04:50.140
They're very simple signals though.

04:50.140 --> 04:51.140
Yeah, they are.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.140
Probably.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.140
A lot of remotes like from TVs work on their TVs, you know?

04:55.140 --> 04:56.140
Yeah.

04:56.140 --> 05:00.140
Well, that's why universal remotes.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.140
Yeah.

05:01.140 --> 05:07.140
I remember there was once a time when like I stuck my remote out a window of a place

05:07.140 --> 05:10.140
I was at and I changed my neighbor's TV.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.140
It was kind of funny.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.140
Asshole.

05:14.140 --> 05:19.140
See, I didn't have the same TV as him, but I had like a similar one and the remote was

05:19.140 --> 05:20.140
compatible.

05:20.140 --> 05:21.140
Yeah.

05:21.140 --> 05:25.140
Oh, you mean like it was the same brand?

05:25.140 --> 05:26.140
Yeah.

05:26.140 --> 05:34.140
And as Dave struggles with his life, he will cut away to an ad from McDonald's.

05:34.140 --> 05:41.140
And here is the Canon HG10.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.140
It's slightly, no, no, I'm sorry.

05:43.140 --> 05:44.140
I'm holding the HG10.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.140
Dave's holding the XA10.

05:46.140 --> 05:52.140
It is, um, it is slightly bigger.

05:52.140 --> 05:55.140
Don't fucking break it already.

05:55.140 --> 05:57.140
It is slightly bigger than the HG10.

05:57.140 --> 06:02.140
It's longer, but it's otherwise like relatively the same size.

06:02.140 --> 06:09.140
And the handle, once you get it on, will attach to the top like right here.

06:09.140 --> 06:14.140
And that's sort of how you carry it around.

06:14.140 --> 06:18.140
And then this attaches right there.

06:18.140 --> 06:21.140
Once we get the cap off.

06:21.140 --> 06:24.140
And that is the full Canon XA10 experience.

06:24.140 --> 06:25.140
Check it out, check it out.

06:25.140 --> 06:26.140
Even this is wider.

06:26.140 --> 06:28.140
It's also a touch screen, dude.

06:28.140 --> 06:30.140
Yeah, it's a touch screen.

06:30.140 --> 06:36.140
It has two SD card slots if you wanted to use SD cards, but it also has an infrared

06:36.140 --> 06:37.140
so you can shoot at night.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.140
Yes, it has an infrared switch.

06:39.140 --> 06:42.140
And I've actually seen some infrared footage on YouTube for this thing.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.140
Me too.

06:43.140 --> 06:44.140
It's pretty good.

06:44.140 --> 06:45.140
It is.

06:45.140 --> 06:46.140
It's pretty impressive.

06:46.140 --> 06:51.140
Um, it has, shut up, a 64 gig hard drive.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.140
The HG10 only has a 32.

06:53.140 --> 06:58.140
Um, but most importantly, it shoots in significantly higher quality.

06:58.140 --> 07:04.140
Well, 1080, compared to the 720 on this magnificent piece of machinery.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.140
Yeah, yeah.

07:05.140 --> 07:14.140
The HG10 could shoot in 720 or in full screen 1080, not in widescreen.

07:14.140 --> 07:24.140
While this is a fully HD camera, and the quality of it is significantly better.

07:24.140 --> 07:27.140
We were looking at other cameras as well.

07:27.140 --> 07:30.140
There is, what is it called, the HGX10?

07:30.140 --> 07:33.140
Or the HGA10?

07:33.140 --> 07:39.140
There was another camera that was basically this camera for a thousand dollars less.

07:39.140 --> 07:44.140
A thousand dollars less, but it didn't have any hard drive space, it didn't have the audio

07:44.140 --> 07:47.140
module, and it didn't have the touch screen, and it didn't have the infrared.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.140
And we were like...

07:49.140 --> 07:51.140
And then, hold on Dave, hold on.

07:51.140 --> 07:58.140
And then it turned out that, um, you look at the XA20, the models that were more expensive

07:58.140 --> 08:04.140
than the XA10, and it didn't have any hard drive space, it just had more SD card slots,

08:04.140 --> 08:05.140
and it didn't have infrared.

08:05.140 --> 08:11.140
And I'm like, how come these more expensive models are lacking features?

08:11.140 --> 08:16.140
You know, I don't quite get the camera scene, but basically we decided that the XA10 was

08:16.140 --> 08:18.140
the professional camera that we wanted.

08:19.140 --> 08:25.140
It normally runs for about $2,700 in Canada, we managed to get it for $14, which is quite

08:25.140 --> 08:30.140
nice, because it was technically used, but it was a store display model, so it was never

08:30.140 --> 08:34.140
actually used, it was only unpackaged and put on a pedestal for a while.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.140
So, it's pretty good.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.140
It's pretty fucking awesome.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.140
Don't break it Dave.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.140
Alright Dave, so do you want to actually...

08:39.140 --> 08:41.140
Let's turn it on and see how it looks.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.140
Okay, turn it on.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.140
I actually already did, but...

08:43.140 --> 08:44.140
I know, I heard the beat.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.140
Check it out.

08:45.140 --> 08:46.140
Camera model.

08:46.140 --> 08:47.140
Camera model.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.140
Holy crap, that looks so much clearer.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.140
Yeah.

08:49.140 --> 08:53.140
There's the component and audio out if you wanted to watch it on your TV.

08:53.140 --> 08:56.140
I'm hoping there's an HDMI hookup, it said that there was.

08:56.140 --> 09:01.140
It's probably on this side, probably underneath Dave's hand or something.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.140
Because we want an HDMI output on this.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.140
Yes, we want an HDMI.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.140
There it is, okay.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.140
I'm not opening that now because I'll drop it.

09:08.140 --> 09:12.140
We do actually have some expansion plans for the show and it's going to require a camera

09:12.140 --> 09:14.140
that has an HDMI out.

09:14.140 --> 09:15.140
It's nice that it does.

09:15.140 --> 09:16.140
Yes, this one did too.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.140
The HG10 also had an HDMI out.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.140
It's on where my fingers as well.

09:21.140 --> 09:24.140
But we never actually ended up using it.

09:24.140 --> 09:27.140
So this is how it actually records.

09:27.140 --> 09:28.140
Let's see...

09:28.140 --> 09:30.140
It took like 20 minutes.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.140
Trying to figure it out.

09:31.140 --> 09:33.140
It is like the simplest thing.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.140
Well, let's see if it's actually any better quality.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.140
I guess you'll see in the video, but I don't fucking know.

09:38.140 --> 09:42.140
We'll have to play back on something a little bigger than this.

09:42.140 --> 09:48.140
Okay, in any case, what we're going to do is we're going to shoot probably kind of like

09:48.140 --> 09:51.140
how we did Mario Party 8 with the sound stuff.

09:51.140 --> 09:57.140
We just kind of recorded a meaningless short series of goofy shit to see if the sound would

09:57.140 --> 09:58.140
work.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.140
Because if the sound didn't work, we were just going to check out the session.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.140
It's not that big of a deal.

10:02.140 --> 10:05.140
We're going to do the same thing with this camera.

10:05.140 --> 10:06.140
We're probably going to record...

10:06.140 --> 10:13.140
I think it'll be Mario Tennis with this camera just to see how it works.

10:13.140 --> 10:17.140
And if we get everything set up properly, then you guys will see Mario Tennis.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.140
And if not, then you guys won't see Mario Tennis.

10:19.140 --> 10:23.140
In fact, if this camera that I'm holding fucks up, you won't even see this video.

10:23.140 --> 10:27.140
So there's that.

10:27.140 --> 10:31.140
We are going to keep the HG10 around as a backup because it still works like some of

10:31.140 --> 10:32.140
the time.

10:32.140 --> 10:37.140
It'll be nice to have like a second angle sometimes or whatever, just like as an auxiliary,

10:37.140 --> 10:38.140
right?

10:38.140 --> 10:42.140
But we're definitely switching over to the XA10 as our main camera.

10:42.140 --> 10:47.140
We have shot a lot of footage on the HG10, so some videos will still be in lower quality

10:47.140 --> 10:48.140
for a little while.

10:48.140 --> 10:52.140
But we'll gradually make the switch over to the new camera.

10:52.140 --> 10:56.140
In any case, I'm going to turn this off now and take it from Dave before he fucking breaks

10:56.140 --> 10:57.140
something.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.140
Goodbye.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.140
Thanks.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.140
Thanks.
