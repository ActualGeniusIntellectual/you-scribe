0	1360	Hey guys, Dev here.
1360	4960	A lot of you who've been watching our channel for a while have probably figured out that
4960	9260	we have used the same camera for the past six and a half years.
9260	15420	It's a Canon HG-10, it's pretty reliable, it survives several house moves, we've filmed
15420	19080	outside in the winter with it, we've filmed on the go with it, and it's largely been a
19080	20420	pretty good camera.
20420	26500	But it's finally starting to die, we recorded a session of Sonic Adventure 2 and it just
26500	32380	failed to record, I mean it showed us the red light saying it was recording but it didn't
32380	35200	actually record any of the footage to the hard drive.
35200	39660	And we thought this might just be a random error with the camera not recording to its
39660	44980	hard drive so we tried playing a session of some Kirby games and that actually did record
44980	50400	but the truth of the matter is, it's just not reliable anymore, we can't be filming
50400	52540	stuff and then lose a whole session of something.
52580	57060	So we're going to keep this camera as a backup but we actually got a new one in the mail
57060	61180	and thanks to everybody who made this possible, this is actually a very nice camera.
62180	63180	What's up?
63180	64180	You're actually awake.
64180	65180	I've been awake for a while.
65180	67180	Here, take the scissors, do you want to open it?
67180	69180	Instead of me doing this myself?
69180	70180	Okay.
70180	71180	Don't fucking break anything.
71180	72180	I shall not.
72180	76180	Don't like stab the scissors through the box and then like ruin it.
76180	78180	You fucking ass.
78180	81660	Off to an amazing start.
81780	84780	I was already getting paranoid.
84780	86660	Straight from Japan.
86660	88660	You should go downstairs and wake up Cam.
88660	93660	Fuck that.
93660	96660	Actually the guy coming up the stairs to deliver actually woke me up.
96660	97660	Oh yeah?
97660	98660	Yeah.
98660	103000	Okay so look at all this high quality paper that he packed it with.
103000	107340	Each sheet is worth five dollars.
107340	114420	It says 1405 Canon V, sorry XA10, 00A34.
114420	115420	And then some Japanese.
115420	116420	Random, random characters.
116420	119580	It's Japanese, you don't be a fucking racist.
119580	120580	Well it's random to us.
120580	121580	Oh what's this?
121580	122580	Ah!
122580	123580	It just has a postcard.
123580	126780	You didn't write anything on the postcard but you sent it as a postcard from Japan.
126780	127780	Thanks Packer.
127780	128780	Is that like the Himeji Castle?
128780	129780	I don't fucking know.
129780	130780	You want to go there one day?
130780	131780	Himeji?
131780	132780	It might actually be Himeji Castle.
132780	134260	You didn't even know what Himeji Castle is.
134260	136300	Yeah it was featured in New England Toys.
136300	139780	It was featured in Civilization V, that's how I know it.
139780	140780	I saw it first.
140780	143780	Value of bubble wrap, which we will pop later.
143780	144780	Okay.
144780	147780	Let's try and see where it's taped.
147780	148780	Yeah.
148780	151780	Just stab your scissors through it.
151780	155620	I thought that was the point, not stabbing it.
155620	160860	We did buy it used because it was like, I think what it was, it was like a store model,
160860	161860	you know?
161860	163860	Like never actually used.
163860	165860	Transfer utility.
166420	167420	Video.
167420	168420	Video.
168420	169420	Power cables.
169420	170420	Yes.
170420	171420	Amazing.
171420	172420	Dude, just fucking cables.
172420	175420	Looks like a lens cover or something.
175420	179100	No not a lens cover, it's what you put on the lens, like you attach it to, well I can't
179100	182820	put it on this fucking camera, but you attach it to the lens to make it work.
182820	186460	You guys see some kind of stand or?
186460	187460	Battery charger I think.
187460	189420	Battery charger I think.
189420	191980	We can, you can unwrap these things and look at them.
191980	193980	I suppose I can.
194100	197100	What do you think we're here for?
197100	198980	The camera, not the accoutrements.
198980	203940	This is the audio module, I know what this is.
203940	209500	This is the audio module, and this, let's see if I can get a good picture of it.
209500	215180	You can put two mics in here, and the controls for them are right here, come on focus, focus
215180	216180	please.
216180	217180	There you go.
217180	219180	Perhaps we should use the new one.
219180	223940	And you can put the two mics, there's the controls for the two mics, and you can basically
223940	227380	have a miniature soundboard on the go, it's good for like on the go interviews, which
227380	228740	hopefully we'll be able to do one day.
228740	229740	Yeah, sure.
229740	230740	Let's go over here.
230740	232540	Yeah, I totally just said that.
232540	239260	You can also attach like a shotgun mic or a light to this fixture here, and also this
239260	240260	fixture here.
240260	242260	And now what's left in there Dave?
242260	251140	Um, looks like the battery pack, sorry, battery charger, and another power cable, very nice.
252140	254140	I wonder what the hell.
254140	258140	And another, dude, dude, look at our own, it has two pieces.
258140	260140	That's true, that's true.
260140	264140	Every fucking power cable nowadays has two pieces.
264140	266140	Another battery pack?
266140	267140	Well, that's the remote.
267140	269140	It looks pretty similar.
269140	272140	Yeah, it's like identical to our, just in black, but it's identical to our other remote.
272140	275140	Oh, that black would look better.
275140	277140	The remote for the HG10s, that's identical.
277140	279140	This covers the battery upper use.
279140	280140	I wonder if like the remotes are compatible.
281140	286140	Like if you use the HG10 remote, it'll actually trigger on the, on the XA10 camera.
286140	288140	I don't know.
288140	290140	They're very simple signals though.
290140	291140	Yeah, they are.
291140	292140	Probably.
292140	295140	A lot of remotes like from TVs work on their TVs, you know?
295140	296140	Yeah.
296140	300140	Well, that's why universal remotes.
300140	301140	Yeah.
301140	307140	I remember there was once a time when like I stuck my remote out a window of a place
307140	310140	I was at and I changed my neighbor's TV.
310140	313140	It was kind of funny.
313140	314140	Asshole.
314140	319140	See, I didn't have the same TV as him, but I had like a similar one and the remote was
319140	320140	compatible.
320140	321140	Yeah.
321140	325140	Oh, you mean like it was the same brand?
325140	326140	Yeah.
326140	334140	And as Dave struggles with his life, he will cut away to an ad from McDonald's.
334140	341140	And here is the Canon HG10.
341140	343140	It's slightly, no, no, I'm sorry.
343140	344140	I'm holding the HG10.
344140	346140	Dave's holding the XA10.
346140	352140	It is, um, it is slightly bigger.
352140	355140	Don't fucking break it already.
355140	357140	It is slightly bigger than the HG10.
357140	362140	It's longer, but it's otherwise like relatively the same size.
362140	369140	And the handle, once you get it on, will attach to the top like right here.
369140	374140	And that's sort of how you carry it around.
374140	378140	And then this attaches right there.
378140	381140	Once we get the cap off.
381140	384140	And that is the full Canon XA10 experience.
384140	385140	Check it out, check it out.
385140	386140	Even this is wider.
386140	388140	It's also a touch screen, dude.
388140	390140	Yeah, it's a touch screen.
390140	396140	It has two SD card slots if you wanted to use SD cards, but it also has an infrared
396140	397140	so you can shoot at night.
397140	399140	Yes, it has an infrared switch.
399140	402140	And I've actually seen some infrared footage on YouTube for this thing.
402140	403140	Me too.
403140	404140	It's pretty good.
404140	405140	It is.
405140	406140	It's pretty impressive.
406140	411140	Um, it has, shut up, a 64 gig hard drive.
411140	413140	The HG10 only has a 32.
413140	418140	Um, but most importantly, it shoots in significantly higher quality.
418140	424140	Well, 1080, compared to the 720 on this magnificent piece of machinery.
424140	425140	Yeah, yeah.
425140	434140	The HG10 could shoot in 720 or in full screen 1080, not in widescreen.
434140	444140	While this is a fully HD camera, and the quality of it is significantly better.
444140	447140	We were looking at other cameras as well.
447140	450140	There is, what is it called, the HGX10?
450140	453140	Or the HGA10?
453140	459140	There was another camera that was basically this camera for a thousand dollars less.
459140	464140	A thousand dollars less, but it didn't have any hard drive space, it didn't have the audio
464140	467140	module, and it didn't have the touch screen, and it didn't have the infrared.
467140	469140	And we were like...
469140	471140	And then, hold on Dave, hold on.
471140	478140	And then it turned out that, um, you look at the XA20, the models that were more expensive
478140	484140	than the XA10, and it didn't have any hard drive space, it just had more SD card slots,
484140	485140	and it didn't have infrared.
485140	491140	And I'm like, how come these more expensive models are lacking features?
491140	496140	You know, I don't quite get the camera scene, but basically we decided that the XA10 was
496140	498140	the professional camera that we wanted.
499140	505140	It normally runs for about $2,700 in Canada, we managed to get it for $14, which is quite
505140	510140	nice, because it was technically used, but it was a store display model, so it was never
510140	514140	actually used, it was only unpackaged and put on a pedestal for a while.
514140	516140	So, it's pretty good.
516140	517140	It's pretty fucking awesome.
517140	518140	Don't break it Dave.
518140	519140	Alright Dave, so do you want to actually...
519140	521140	Let's turn it on and see how it looks.
521140	522140	Okay, turn it on.
522140	523140	I actually already did, but...
523140	524140	I know, I heard the beat.
524140	525140	Check it out.
525140	526140	Camera model.
526140	527140	Camera model.
527140	528140	Holy crap, that looks so much clearer.
528140	529140	Yeah.
529140	533140	There's the component and audio out if you wanted to watch it on your TV.
533140	536140	I'm hoping there's an HDMI hookup, it said that there was.
536140	541140	It's probably on this side, probably underneath Dave's hand or something.
541140	543140	Because we want an HDMI output on this.
543140	545140	Yes, we want an HDMI.
545140	546140	There it is, okay.
546140	548140	I'm not opening that now because I'll drop it.
548140	552140	We do actually have some expansion plans for the show and it's going to require a camera
552140	554140	that has an HDMI out.
554140	555140	It's nice that it does.
555140	556140	Yes, this one did too.
556140	559140	The HG10 also had an HDMI out.
559140	561140	It's on where my fingers as well.
561140	564140	But we never actually ended up using it.
564140	567140	So this is how it actually records.
567140	568140	Let's see...
568140	570140	It took like 20 minutes.
570140	571140	Trying to figure it out.
571140	573140	It is like the simplest thing.
573140	576140	Well, let's see if it's actually any better quality.
576140	578140	I guess you'll see in the video, but I don't fucking know.
578140	582140	We'll have to play back on something a little bigger than this.
582140	588140	Okay, in any case, what we're going to do is we're going to shoot probably kind of like
588140	591140	how we did Mario Party 8 with the sound stuff.
591140	597140	We just kind of recorded a meaningless short series of goofy shit to see if the sound would
597140	598140	work.
598140	601140	Because if the sound didn't work, we were just going to check out the session.
601140	602140	It's not that big of a deal.
602140	605140	We're going to do the same thing with this camera.
605140	606140	We're probably going to record...
606140	613140	I think it'll be Mario Tennis with this camera just to see how it works.
613140	617140	And if we get everything set up properly, then you guys will see Mario Tennis.
617140	619140	And if not, then you guys won't see Mario Tennis.
619140	623140	In fact, if this camera that I'm holding fucks up, you won't even see this video.
623140	627140	So there's that.
627140	631140	We are going to keep the HG10 around as a backup because it still works like some of
631140	632140	the time.
632140	637140	It'll be nice to have like a second angle sometimes or whatever, just like as an auxiliary,
637140	638140	right?
638140	642140	But we're definitely switching over to the XA10 as our main camera.
642140	647140	We have shot a lot of footage on the HG10, so some videos will still be in lower quality
647140	648140	for a little while.
648140	652140	But we'll gradually make the switch over to the new camera.
652140	656140	In any case, I'm going to turn this off now and take it from Dave before he fucking breaks
656140	657140	something.
657140	658140	Goodbye.
658140	659140	Thanks.
659140	660140	Thanks.
