0	5560	Hey chums, no video today unfortunately, I spent a whole bunch of today shooting some
5560	10560	stuff for the 50,000 subs special which I know I still haven't gotten out, it's been
10560	16920	like a month since I hit 50,000 subs but I wanted to do something special for it so I
16920	22120	shot some stuff today and I just don't have time to put out a video.
22120	26820	Instead let me fluff my ego a bit if you don't mind.
26820	31780	So on Twitch I've been playing a game called Trails in the Sky, it's not a bad game but
31780	34680	it's not a game that I would normally play.
34680	39620	I'm playing it because one of my supporters has hit the donation tier to play a game with
39620	40620	me on stream.
40620	47940	Anyway, on stream he asked me what is the grossest most expired food that I have or
47940	52980	I've ever seen and I thought about it for a bit and I think I can show you guys what
52980	54420	it is just for fun.
54420	59400	It is this, crushed pineapple.
59400	67200	You can see the cans inflated on both sides, it's inflated and those of you who are Canadians
67200	75880	will recognize this packaging as having gone out of style many, many, many years ago.
75880	80460	This can of crushed pineapple is from 1996, look at it.
80460	83880	Look at how it's fucking, look at it.
83880	88160	So the whole deal with this can of crushed pineapple is that my mom bought it back in
88160	89160	1996.
89160	94640	I was just a kid, I was with her in the grocery store and it went down into the family pantry
94640	96880	back at my parents' place.
96880	100000	And it sat there and it sat there, it was in the back of the pantry, it just got ignored
100000	106000	over the years and eventually when my parents decided to move into a smaller house because
106000	110680	I had moved into my own house and my sister moved out, they had just decided to downsize.
110680	114480	We were cleaning the house out, we cleaned out the pantry and I found this can and my
114480	119160	mom said, oh just throw it out and I said no way, there's no way I'm throwing, it hadn't
119160	123840	inflated at that point but I was like there's no way I'm throwing this thing out, it's kind
123840	126600	of a relic at this point you know.
126600	135840	So I kept it and I brought it to my house here, I live in a different city, but anyway
135840	141480	I put it in the back of my pantry and over time, it spins because it's inflated, in fact
141480	148760	it was on the bottom and behind a bunch of other cans and I noticed it because the stack
148760	152560	of tuna had like slightly shifted because it was starting to expand upward and push
152560	154100	the rest of the tuna cans.
154100	156680	So I pulled it out and I realized that it was inflating like a balloon.
156680	161600	I have no idea what causes this by the way, I don't really know why when canned foods
161600	165920	get this old they start to expand, but I have noticed that it's been expanding more
165920	167660	and more over time.
167660	173440	So I know I haven't even completed the 50,000 sub video yet, it is coming probably in about
173440	176560	two weeks time, but you know what I'll do?
176560	182960	If and when I hit 100,000 subs, I'll open this can and see what's inside of it.
182960	188840	I hope you guys are interested in that, I might fucking die, so enjoy.
188840	192960	I'll see you later, I'm probably going to stream on Twitch tonight, address is on the
192960	194400	screen, you know where to go.
194400	199880	New video tomorrow and Road to 100k, awesome, I love you.
