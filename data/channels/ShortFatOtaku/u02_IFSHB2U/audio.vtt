Hey chums, no video today unfortunately, I spent a whole bunch of today shooting some

00:05.560 --> 00:10.560
stuff for the 50,000 subs special which I know I still haven't gotten out, it's been

00:10.560 --> 00:16.920
like a month since I hit 50,000 subs but I wanted to do something special for it so I

00:16.920 --> 00:22.120
shot some stuff today and I just don't have time to put out a video.

00:22.120 --> 00:26.820
Instead let me fluff my ego a bit if you don't mind.

00:26.820 --> 00:31.780
So on Twitch I've been playing a game called Trails in the Sky, it's not a bad game but

00:31.780 --> 00:34.680
it's not a game that I would normally play.

00:34.680 --> 00:39.620
I'm playing it because one of my supporters has hit the donation tier to play a game with

00:39.620 --> 00:40.620
me on stream.

00:40.620 --> 00:47.940
Anyway, on stream he asked me what is the grossest most expired food that I have or

00:47.940 --> 00:52.980
I've ever seen and I thought about it for a bit and I think I can show you guys what

00:52.980 --> 00:54.420
it is just for fun.

00:54.420 --> 00:59.400
It is this, crushed pineapple.

00:59.400 --> 01:07.200
You can see the cans inflated on both sides, it's inflated and those of you who are Canadians

01:07.200 --> 01:15.880
will recognize this packaging as having gone out of style many, many, many years ago.

01:15.880 --> 01:20.460
This can of crushed pineapple is from 1996, look at it.

01:20.460 --> 01:23.880
Look at how it's fucking, look at it.

01:23.880 --> 01:28.160
So the whole deal with this can of crushed pineapple is that my mom bought it back in

01:28.160 --> 01:29.160
1996.

01:29.160 --> 01:34.640
I was just a kid, I was with her in the grocery store and it went down into the family pantry

01:34.640 --> 01:36.880
back at my parents' place.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.000
And it sat there and it sat there, it was in the back of the pantry, it just got ignored

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
over the years and eventually when my parents decided to move into a smaller house because

01:46.000 --> 01:50.680
I had moved into my own house and my sister moved out, they had just decided to downsize.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.480
We were cleaning the house out, we cleaned out the pantry and I found this can and my

01:54.480 --> 01:59.160
mom said, oh just throw it out and I said no way, there's no way I'm throwing, it hadn't

01:59.160 --> 02:03.840
inflated at that point but I was like there's no way I'm throwing this thing out, it's kind

02:03.840 --> 02:06.600
of a relic at this point you know.

02:06.600 --> 02:15.840
So I kept it and I brought it to my house here, I live in a different city, but anyway

02:15.840 --> 02:21.480
I put it in the back of my pantry and over time, it spins because it's inflated, in fact

02:21.480 --> 02:28.760
it was on the bottom and behind a bunch of other cans and I noticed it because the stack

02:28.760 --> 02:32.560
of tuna had like slightly shifted because it was starting to expand upward and push

02:32.560 --> 02:34.100
the rest of the tuna cans.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.680
So I pulled it out and I realized that it was inflating like a balloon.

02:36.680 --> 02:41.600
I have no idea what causes this by the way, I don't really know why when canned foods

02:41.600 --> 02:45.920
get this old they start to expand, but I have noticed that it's been expanding more

02:45.920 --> 02:47.660
and more over time.

02:47.660 --> 02:53.440
So I know I haven't even completed the 50,000 sub video yet, it is coming probably in about

02:53.440 --> 02:56.560
two weeks time, but you know what I'll do?

02:56.560 --> 03:02.960
If and when I hit 100,000 subs, I'll open this can and see what's inside of it.

03:02.960 --> 03:08.840
I hope you guys are interested in that, I might fucking die, so enjoy.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.960
I'll see you later, I'm probably going to stream on Twitch tonight, address is on the

03:12.960 --> 03:14.400
screen, you know where to go.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.880
New video tomorrow and Road to 100k, awesome, I love you.
