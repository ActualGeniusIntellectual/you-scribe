0	10040	Hey all, if I sound a bit out of it, it's because I'm recording this on Monday afternoon
10040	13540	while I'm still sick with a sore throat. It feels like it's coming down, but I still
13540	17440	might sound odd, I certainly still feel odd. Because of this, even though I'm recording
17440	20560	on Monday, you're probably not going to see the video until Tuesday.
20560	25320	Last night, I was watching Adam and Sitch's weekly Sunday show. This time around, they
25320	29120	were talking about Lindsay Ellis' recent video about getting cancelled, where she goes
29120	33940	over all of the cancellable things she's done and gives her side of each story. As
33940	38880	always, Adam and Sitch do a great job at picking apart the train wreck of hypocrisy and narcissism
38880	44160	for, uh, 11 hours. But the most telling part of Lindsay's video is where she states that
44160	48860	she cannot admit the broader left has a problem with cancelling people, because labelling
48860	51800	the problem empowers her ideological opponents.
51800	56080	A friend of mine named it The Beast, the name for the sphere that we all live under but
56080	60800	don't acknowledge. And over the last few years, I have had so many of my colleagues,
60800	65400	all of them women, people of color, trans people, queer people, or some combination
65400	70860	of the above, voice to me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something
70860	74600	wrong that will get them on the bad side of their own communities. Every thought is a
74600	79680	hostage situation. Is this the tweet that's going to sink me? So what do we call it? What
79680	84060	is the name for this unspoken, unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one
84060	89100	misstep can ruin our lives? This social media culture where we participate in the public
89100	93340	shaming one day and become chained to the pillory the next. We can't even talk about
93340	97140	it because The Beast does not have a name. If we admit that this is a problem, then the
97140	101380	right will just take it and run with it and use it to increase their own power, same as
101380	105740	they did with cancel, same as they did with woke, same as they did with fake news. If
105740	110880	it has a name, then it has power, so it is a discussion that cannot be had. And so we
110880	116120	do not have it. We say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease. Pretend it
116120	120320	isn't doing real harm. In other words, the intersectionalists have cultivated the cancel
120320	124580	culture environment. The conservatives have correctly identified it as a problem. And
124580	127980	so the intersectionalists can't actually do anything except take it from their own
127980	133100	audiences in order to never agree with the conservatives on anything. And yes, the intersectionalists
133100	137440	are the ones who have cultivated cancel culture. A core point of Lindsay's video was something
137440	142720	like, cancel culture is when your own community destroys you, which is just an absurd statement.
142720	148440	Prominent controversial conservatives like Alex Jones or Tommy Robinson were not destroyed by
148440	152760	their own fans, but instead by progressives screeching that their opinions were too vile
152760	157640	to ever allow to be spoken. And then that sentiment came for regular non-controversial
157640	162560	conservatives, then centrists and liberals, and now it's finally affecting the big tent left,
162560	167240	and they're not happy about it. One of Lindsay's friends, ContraPoints, pointed out on Twitter
167240	171720	that there is a parallel between what she calls Diet Nazi Internet, which is literally
171720	176720	just the people who troll and laugh on Chan sites, kiwi farms, and Encyclopedia Dramatica,
176720	182240	and Twitter Wokescolds who anthologize a person's entire history of misdeeds and embarrassments.
182240	187160	I have some sympathy for this position. Myself, Lindsay, and Contra are all old enough to
187160	192160	have experienced our formative years offline and without social media. A lot of my embarrassing
192160	197840	childhood and teenage moments are not immortalized as tweets or videos, to be brought up a decade
197840	203920	later to destroy my adult life, but are simply hazy memories and funny stories. Or not so funny,
203920	208920	as the case may be. However, ContraPoints believes that the parallel she draws means
208920	213760	that cancel culture is not unique to the left. On the surface this makes a lot of sense. It may
213760	218600	even have been an opinion I once held at one point, but I don't think so anymore. She brings
218600	223680	up Gamergate as an example of right wing cancel culture, and again on the surface I see why.
223680	228440	It was an angry group of gamers on the internet, yelling about how individuals within the subcultures
228440	232440	of indie game development and games journalism were acting unethically, and therefore deserve
232440	237440	to be out of a job. To compare, today's cancelling events are angry groups of progressives on the
237440	242080	internet, yelling about how whatever celebrity or e-celebrity has said something bigoted,
242080	246860	or defended the wrong person or take, or simply had an accusation even a false one flung at them,
246860	250500	and therefore also deserve to be out of a job. But you can already see the difference, right?
250500	255460	The core people involved in Gamergate actually acted unethically, and their customers responded
255460	260300	with a consumer boycott. It's always seemed very strange to me that a rabidly anti-capitalist
260300	265220	political camp would turn around and decry large swaths of normal, everyday,
265220	271020	dare I say proletariat people engaging in a consumer boycott against the owners of capital,
271020	275660	and instead actually side with those owners. Meanwhile most of today's cancel events don't
275660	281140	seem to involve any kind of actual gamergate style ethical breaches. Piers Morgan was cancelled when
281140	285780	he said that Meghan Markle's son couldn't become a prince, not due to racism, but due to the current
285780	290540	laws of succession. Gina Carano was cancelled for a long list of tiny reasons regarding pronouns and
290540	295620	tweets and whatever, but the big one was saying that today's mob mentality went too far, comparing
295620	300220	it to Nazi Germany. Tucker Carlson seems to face a cancelling event once a year like clockwork.
300220	304300	Dr. Seuss was cancelled over the content of books that are considered racist today,
304340	308740	but were acceptable for the time period, and funnily enough, Disney has not been cancelled
308740	313820	for the same thing regarding their old movies. Gabb and Parler were cancelled after the January
313820	318580	6th Capitol riots, despite Facebook being a larger hub for the organization of that event.
318580	323060	Troy Levitt was invited to resign from his job, working on the game Hogwarts Legacy,
323060	327180	when people noticed he ran an anti-SJW YouTube channel back in the day. Keemstar,
327180	331660	Pewdiepie and JonTron have all been cancelled multiple times. The list goes on, from Hollywood
331660	336140	celebrities, to online personalities, to companies and products. The difference between these events
336140	340620	and Gamergate is clear to me. These don't seem to involve any legal or ethical breaches,
340620	345860	but rather differences of opinion over politics or philosophy or even art. I think this is why
345860	350980	the pro-Jared situation felt different than your usual cancelling event, even though pro-Jared was
350980	354820	obviously innocent in the end, and it's because he was actually accused of something that,
354820	358580	if it were true, would have been a real violation and not something trumped up.
358580	363460	Compare these two scenarios. In the first, a small YouTuber named Trillium, with less than
363460	368500	5,000 subs, makes a video about how she doesn't like The Last of Us Part 2. Her take goes viral
368500	373220	with both fans of Naughty Dog and progressives plugged into the culture war, and she catches so
373220	377860	much flak that people dox her and she deletes her online presence and goes into hiding. In the
377860	382500	second, Asmongold on stream goes over the blatant racism of one of Blizzard Entertainment's writers,
382500	387460	Madeleine Roux, while noticing that she may be related to the senior vice president of HR. His
387460	392220	fans notice a surprising amount of similar racism and sexism from other writers at Blizzard. In the
392220	396300	first scenario, a person has an opinion about something innocuous that runs counter to the
396300	400340	mainline progressive narrative, and they get harassed for it by a crowd of people largely
400340	404260	unrelated to them. In the second scenario, a progressive within a position of power acts
404260	408060	unethically and hypocritically, and their own consumer base shines a light on their bad
408060	412660	behavior. The first scenario is cancel culture, because it's done by people wholly unrelated to
412660	416900	the target for completely asinine reasons. The second scenario is accountability, because it's
416900	420500	done by the people who consume the product created by the target, holding the belief that their own
420500	425100	subculture is being weaponized against them by those in power. Of course, if you're a progressive,
425100	429740	there seems to be all the motivation in the world to conflate these two things. A non-lefty gets
429740	434100	canceled for ridiculous reasons? It's just consequence culture. It's accountability. You
434100	438340	did something bad and deserve it for sure. A lefty gets held accountable for their own shitty actions?
438340	443540	Oh no, cancel culture is at it again? I'm not at fault, it's those evil goobergators. But
443540	447900	muddying the waters between these two things obscures their most important difference. While
447900	452700	it's true that consequence culture, that accountability, that the consumer boycott is apolitical,
452700	458500	as ContraPoints pointed out, cancel culture itself is specifically a product of progressivism. This
458500	463060	is why whenever somebody is canceled over something benign, like both Lindsay Ellis and ContraPoints
463060	468300	have been, it is always by their own progressive audiences. And in fact, whenever anybody of any
468300	472940	political persuasion is canceled over something benign, it's always by a progressive mob. The
472940	478540	people who wish to wield the justice of the mob against anybody on a whim have purposefully blurred
478540	484180	the boundaries between canceling events and consumer boycotts. And with that merger now
484180	489500	complete, you need not think about anything other than the politics of the parties involved. For
489500	494580	example, was it cancel culture going too far, or just accountability in action when Jimmy
494580	500060	Galligan held onto a three-second clip of a white teenage girl saying the n-word while singing along
500060	505660	to a song, only to finally release it years later when that girl was an adult in order to foul her
505660	510180	university admissions? Well, in the mindset of the progressive, we only need to understand the
510180	514500	target's politics to know if it was deserved, or even worse, her race or gender. Now that we've
514500	519660	stripped away the meaningful difference between canceling events and consumer boycotts, tribalism
519660	524580	is all we have left. You can apply this framework to any event. Why did Justin Trudeau get away with
524580	529700	blackface? Why did Sarah Jong not immediately lose her journalist job over old racist tweets
529700	536140	when Alexi McCammond lost hers over her old racist tweets? Why did a literary agent get fired solely
536140	541460	over owning a parlor account? The answer to each of these questions is, what tribe are you a part
541460	545500	of? The problem with countering this type of conflation is that it can be really hard to
545500	550220	discern the truth based on who's presenting the evidence. This video went viral last week,
550220	554900	and it's an excellent example of what I mean. Tariq Wash Yoaz Nasheed posted,
554900	560780	A white Holiday Inn Express worker has a nervous breakdown after he got scolded by a black customer
560780	562620	because of a mistake in the reservation system.
580220	585500	Did you get mad and hit the computer? I'm sure you're on camera, right? I'm sure you're on camera.
585500	610660	So this is the type of people that have working here. Wow. You gotta be kidding me.
615500	627660	Wow. And a lot of people lost it on Tariq for posting what is clearly a man having a nervous
627660	633180	breakdown and making it about race. But a lot of people is not everybody. Somebody make sure this
633180	637060	white boy don't have a gun. Would he have done that if the man wasn't black? He would have fixed
637060	640980	the issue and moved on like he probably did countless of times before then. Black people
640980	645780	are never afforded the grace of a public mental health meltdown. This man has mental health issues
645780	650740	and shouldn't be in a public facing job. The black man who filmed feared for his safety.
650740	657260	Hold on a second guys. I'm sick. I'm trying to record this video and somebody royally fucked up
657260	661020	the SFO Minecraft server. I was mid recording and I had to go fix it. It took like an hour.
661020	665540	This is going to be a big audio file. If you didn't know we had a community Minecraft server,
665540	669740	well now you do. Join us sometime. In any case, from the progressive BIPOC lens,
670060	674380	Tariq and the others are absolutely correct. This is a black person fearing for their lives
674380	678180	and recording a potential white aggressors meltdown. However, from the progressive,
678180	683100	ableist and queer centric lens, all of these people objecting to Tariq Nasheed are absolutely
683100	688060	right too. This is a neuro atypical gay man being harassed by a privileged healthy straight
688060	692820	oppressor who is about to use his own oppression to ruin his life. But neither of these are the
692820	698460	correct lens to use. They each filter out important information. The first lens implies that if the
698460	703300	races of the person recording the video and the hotel clerk were reversed, then suddenly it would
703300	707300	be objectionable to record him. And Tariq would absolutely say so if that were the case. The
707300	712140	second lens implies that it would be totally fine to cancel this person if he didn't have his mental
712140	716180	problems. And yes, this is exactly how it's coming off to progressives who find themselves
716180	721740	prioritizing race and losing that clash on this event. If he was just a normal white guy who
721740	726620	wasn't mentally retarded or a gay freak or whatever, nobody would give a fuck. He would
726620	731500	lose his job, and everyone would agree with Tariq. It is the use of these lenses that turns
731500	737260	everything into a premeditated calculated strike with no room for the actual humanity of the people
737260	741980	involved. Is no one going to point out that the reason the guy smashed the computer on his head
741980	746180	is because he knew that the black guy was trying to frame him as a racist and destroy his life?
746180	750980	That's the new strategy. If you can't defend yourself with words, just have an autistic mental
750980	754780	breakdown. The quartering started up a GoFundMe in support of this guy, which has gained a lot of
754780	759020	traction. But judging by his Reddit post history, he doesn't seem to want it. Since the event,
759020	763740	he's been slowly spiraling into worse and worse depression, with the family of the guy who recorded
763740	767780	him harassing him at his workplace, which he quit, as well as his home, threatening his life. And
767780	772300	because legitimate consumer boycott has been merged with cancel culture, the only tool the
772300	776980	progressive has left to judge whether or not this event was justice served or justice aborted is
776980	780540	which progressive lens you think it's more appropriate to look through. Meanwhile, the
780540	785860	individualist position rejects all of these lenses and simply says treat people like individuals. It
785860	790260	doesn't matter if one's black and one's white. It doesn't matter if one has mental problems and the
790260	793700	other doesn't. I mean, it might matter in terms of understanding why he had that kind of reaction,
793700	797540	but it doesn't matter in terms of understanding whether or not he deserves to be dragged through
797540	802620	the mud. And yes, for the progressive, it most certainly comes down to this type of tribalism
802620	808540	rather than any actual interest in real wrongdoing. One can be strongly against a cancel culture and
808540	812780	still support the cancellation of dangerous psychopaths. And who defines the psychopath Sam
812780	817940	Harris? Would that be the progressives by any chance? And again, yes, the muddying effect I've
817940	823700	been describing is real. Cancel culture in 2020 is exactly what political correctness was in 1990.
823700	827780	It's a thing conservatives made up so they can pretend they are speaking truth to power and
827780	832660	fighting for free speech when they are actually just being awful people. No, what's actually
832660	837460	happening is that when people speak truth to your power, when they advocate for speech you don't
837500	842980	like, the only thing you can do is conflate them with the idea of just being awful. Honestly,
842980	848900	what a lot of this behavior stems from is simple narcissism. If you watch Lindsay Ellis's hour 40
848900	853700	non-apology video, you can clearly see it. The whole thing is filled with digs and backstabs
853700	859180	and humble brags and fake ass apologies. These are people who view themselves as the hero while
859180	863980	simultaneously celebrating the shutting down of all opinions that go against them, the firing of
864020	868380	all people who do not march in lockstep with them, and the subversion of all organizations
868380	873300	and platforms to suit their needs. These are people who shriek bloody murder about the injustices of
873300	878020	cancel culture when their Patreon is raking in $18,000 a month rather than the $20,000 they're
878020	882860	accustomed to. All the while gleefully getting the assistant manager at Payless Shoes fired
882860	887660	because he's sexist for posting on his private Twitter account that he doesn't like the new
887660	892540	Star Wars movies. If progressives actually thought anybody I've talked about in this video has done
892580	896700	anything wrong and they were actually interested in justice, they would talk to them. But it's not
896700	901060	about peace and understanding, it's about control and dominance. Progressives are pushing an anti
901060	905980	hierarchy philosophy and when your average rank-and-file progressive turns on the progressives
905980	910140	at the top of the hierarchy, they're shocked it finally came for them. Here's where we are now.
910140	915340	Your average person is no longer comfortable sharing their political views. This is not a
915340	921020	good turn of events. Civil society survives when disagreements happen at the ballot box and during
921020	925940	a debate. It crumbles when they happen in the streets and on the battlefield. But that is the
925940	930060	future we're moving towards. A growing chorus of people who have survived the many repressive
930060	934540	governments around the world have all been saying that what they see in cancel culture is the
934540	939580	beginnings of a totalitarian regime. It's no surprise to me therefore that ContraPoints went
939580	946180	on a podcast recently to advocate for Maoist style struggle sessions where a person accused
946180	952100	goes through a revolutionary tribunal where they get raked over the coals by those who object to
952100	957180	their past behavior so that they may come out the other side as a redeemed comrade. It feels like
957180	964100	there is a cultural void when it comes to what penance and absolution looks like. The options
964100	971580	are excommunication from society or no consequences whatsoever. Yeah I've actually had the thought
971580	980820	that it would be better to have something like internet panels of restorative justice. Yes. And
980820	985580	I know that probably sounds like super dystopian but I would argue it's way less dystopian than
985580	990780	what we currently have. Like but if people who had you know so suppose someone's going through
990780	996300	a canceling event I think we all know what that means at this point right. Oh the tweet is trending
996300	1001420	we're talking about it right. If we were able to kind of have I don't know like a live stream or
1001660	1007340	something with a peacekeeper or mediator where like the person who is accused is sort of able
1007340	1012460	to sort of I don't know face the people the group of people that's maybe hurt by this and like able
1012460	1018060	to kind of try to understand where each other is coming from if we can see if this you know give
1018060	1023060	some percent get try to get some sense for if the person who's you know who did blackface 20 years
1023060	1028100	ago has actually moved on or not do they understand why this is bad like is you know have they done
1028100	1034460	things in the time sense that would sort of be the opposite values of that in action. It's an
1034460	1041980	online revolutionary tribunal. Yeah. And you know we'll have we'll have judges. Powdered wigs we
1041980	1048500	gotta bring back the powdered wigs. We can do a little camp. Maybe it's like the three judges are
1048500	1053340	all dressed differently and one has a powdered wig and another is wearing the the Mao outfit.
1053340	1060020	This is the end point of the progressives cancel culture. They are fundamentally hypocritical and
1060020	1064380	they want to affect everybody except themselves. However now that they're learning that it cannot
1064380	1069740	not affect them they want to implement a dystopian apology process where the progressive gets to
1069740	1074860	self-flagellate for the benefit of all for the crime of making a rape joke in 2009 and as for
1074860	1080460	the unrepentant what do they get executed I mean they did in Maoist China they did during the
1080460	1084620	French Revolution that's not going to happen now at least not online are they getting deleted off
1084620	1089980	the internet maybe but all tech is a thing now Sarah Silverman properly identified that because
1089980	1094340	progressives don't offer a path to redemption regular people are simply abandoning the
1094340	1099220	progressive idea of justice and finding kinship elsewhere that's what bit shoot and mines and
1099220	1104300	parlor are part of what I've been talking about here can be more properly explained in the article
1104300	1110260	beating back cancel culture by Pedro Domingos in it he outlines a list of things you should
1110300	1115740	do during a canceling event find your friends pick your battles know what to expect don't back down
1115740	1121900	don't let them make it about you hold the moral high ground mock them mercilessly don't let their
1121900	1127340	narrative outrun yours goad them into overreaching turn their weapons against them use the courts
1127340	1133380	bring administrators around don't antagonize educate get the majority on your side and most
1133380	1137740	importantly remember that most cancellation attempts end in failure if you're getting
1137740	1140980	canceled you don't have to do all of these things but you do have to do most of them and really the
1140980	1145140	most important one is remembering that most cancellation attempts end in failure how many
1145140	1149740	times has Lindsay Ellis been canceled before she made this video like 15 most of them did nothing
1149740	1154580	at all and that is how you have to approach getting canceled it can only truly stop you if
1154580	1158300	you let it stop you I'm not saying you're gonna come out of it unscathed you may lose a friend or
1158300	1163620	a job and that sucks but you can make new friends or land new jobs but if you capitulate to them you
1163620	1168860	only make the losses more severe or even worse you begin to inflict them on yourself when I look
1168860	1173260	at Domingos list I realize it's the complete opposite vision of what contra points espouse
1173260	1178100	in that podcast with her struggle sessions the point of a struggle session is to lose to the
1178100	1183020	mob so that you can be taught the lesson you need to learn the point of Domingos list is to oppose
1183020	1188020	the mob because you don't agree there's anything that they can teach you and you know as dystopian
1188020	1193300	as it sounds part of me loves the idea of attending an internet struggle session I would not mind the
1193300	1198100	opportunity to tell all of these self-important losers off to their face to completely reject
1198100	1202940	their conception of justice to let them know that I do not regret any of my past actions and to shove
1202940	1208100	their opportunities of forgiveness up their cloacas I have no need to be absolved of my
1208100	1213700	crimes by progressives vosh style because I have not committed any crimes at all yeah I do just
1213700	1218820	want the opportunity to shit on the whole thing but talking seriously no internet struggle sessions
1218820	1222860	are an awful dystopian idea from a group of people who cannot conceive of actually living
1222940	1228380	in freedom cancel culture is just rebranded witch-hunting and it's one repressive practice
1228380	1233700	of many that progressives have brought back from our past racism and sexism are okay again if it's
1233700	1238540	directed towards white men sexuality is bad again not because of the conservative calling it
1238540	1244180	ungodly but the progressive calling it objectifying stalking is okay again as long as you call it
1244180	1249260	stanning being gay or trans is a choice again because the idea of immutable characteristics
1249260	1255060	is now biological essentialism fighting fascism is now simply making a snarky post online it's
1255060	1259460	somebody your favorite youtuber said is a Nazi and when you hit that send button it's almost like
1259460	1265380	being there on D day freedom of expression is encouraged but only if living your best life means
1265380	1270660	saying and doing things that progressives approve of every single problem I've listed off is a
1270660	1275900	progressive problem and really there's no progress in it these are all rollbacks not advancements
1275900	1280900	cancel culture as well as contra points is a struggle session solution for it are just
1280900	1286140	modern-day drumhead trials there's no justice here nothing's improved nobody's wrongs are
1286140	1290540	righted nobody deserves the punishments they get so when the mob comes for you tell them to fuck
1290540	1295380	off even if they're right tell them to fuck off because you can privately take whatever legitimate
1295380	1300660	criticism some of them may have without allowing them to destroy you don't be so pigheaded to
1300660	1304820	assume that any person who speaks against you is out to destroy you that's a fast track to
1304820	1308820	spoonieville but also don't let them use their honest attempt to point out a problem as a vector
1308820	1312780	to actually harm you either this is advice that the progressive will never truly be able to accept
1312780	1318060	because in blurring the boundaries between unjust cancellation and just accountability they've also
1318060	1322160	blurred the boundaries between those who would point out their blind spots and those who would
1322160	1326460	attempt to destroy them they have made it so that they can never again self-improve through a
1326460	1330740	friend's honest criticism because that friend and now appears to them as the villain moving in for
1330980	1336900	but here we're individualists not progressives and that problem isn't our problem we know the
1336900	1340700	difference between a friend's criticism and an enemy's attack just as we know the difference
1340700	1345140	between the consequences of a real mistake and angry people filling up our mentions or something
1345140	1349100	that we still think is correct it doesn't matter if they appeal to the authority of numbers of
1349100	1354780	their large mob against your lone opinion they may derisively call you protagonist brain that's
1354780	1359180	only because they're all NPCs it doesn't matter if they appeal to the correct opinion or the proper
1359180	1365180	politics they will call you Nazi or fascist or alt-right or whatever else solely out of desperation
1365180	1370340	it might matter if they manage to worm their way into your IRL circles if they call your job or
1370340	1375000	your family or your partner it's certainly possible to lose those things and that's no joke but if you
1375000	1379620	remain on good terms with them if you let them know what's happening if you are a good honest
1379620	1384260	trustworthy person they will side with their experience of you over what a random online
1384260	1389180	person says any day and if they don't they probably weren't good for you in any case point
1389180	1394700	is while the overbearing officer might say if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear to
1394700	1399940	justify the state's unwarranted surveillance the Liberty focused argument regarding cancel culture
1399940	1404980	is actually this sayings inverse if you have nothing to fear then you have nothing to hide if
1404980	1411020	you are true in your convictions then show them no fear when the angry mob of people comes for you
1411020	1416180	and you're certain you've done no wrong then anchor yourself right beside the truth and weather
