00:00.000 --> 00:10.040
Hey all, if I sound a bit out of it, it's because I'm recording this on Monday afternoon

00:10.040 --> 00:13.540
while I'm still sick with a sore throat. It feels like it's coming down, but I still

00:13.540 --> 00:17.440
might sound odd, I certainly still feel odd. Because of this, even though I'm recording

00:17.440 --> 00:20.560
on Monday, you're probably not going to see the video until Tuesday.

00:20.560 --> 00:25.320
Last night, I was watching Adam and Sitch's weekly Sunday show. This time around, they

00:25.320 --> 00:29.120
were talking about Lindsay Ellis' recent video about getting cancelled, where she goes

00:29.120 --> 00:33.940
over all of the cancellable things she's done and gives her side of each story. As

00:33.940 --> 00:38.880
always, Adam and Sitch do a great job at picking apart the train wreck of hypocrisy and narcissism

00:38.880 --> 00:44.160
for, uh, 11 hours. But the most telling part of Lindsay's video is where she states that

00:44.160 --> 00:48.860
she cannot admit the broader left has a problem with cancelling people, because labelling

00:48.860 --> 00:51.800
the problem empowers her ideological opponents.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.080
A friend of mine named it The Beast, the name for the sphere that we all live under but

00:56.080 --> 01:00.800
don't acknowledge. And over the last few years, I have had so many of my colleagues,

01:00.800 --> 01:05.400
all of them women, people of color, trans people, queer people, or some combination

01:05.400 --> 01:10.860
of the above, voice to me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something

01:10.860 --> 01:14.600
wrong that will get them on the bad side of their own communities. Every thought is a

01:14.600 --> 01:19.680
hostage situation. Is this the tweet that's going to sink me? So what do we call it? What

01:19.680 --> 01:24.060
is the name for this unspoken, unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one

01:24.060 --> 01:29.100
misstep can ruin our lives? This social media culture where we participate in the public

01:29.100 --> 01:33.340
shaming one day and become chained to the pillory the next. We can't even talk about

01:33.340 --> 01:37.140
it because The Beast does not have a name. If we admit that this is a problem, then the

01:37.140 --> 01:41.380
right will just take it and run with it and use it to increase their own power, same as

01:41.380 --> 01:45.740
they did with cancel, same as they did with woke, same as they did with fake news. If

01:45.740 --> 01:50.880
it has a name, then it has power, so it is a discussion that cannot be had. And so we

01:50.880 --> 01:56.120
do not have it. We say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease. Pretend it

01:56.120 --> 02:00.320
isn't doing real harm. In other words, the intersectionalists have cultivated the cancel

02:00.320 --> 02:04.580
culture environment. The conservatives have correctly identified it as a problem. And

02:04.580 --> 02:07.980
so the intersectionalists can't actually do anything except take it from their own

02:07.980 --> 02:13.100
audiences in order to never agree with the conservatives on anything. And yes, the intersectionalists

02:13.100 --> 02:17.440
are the ones who have cultivated cancel culture. A core point of Lindsay's video was something

02:17.440 --> 02:22.720
like, cancel culture is when your own community destroys you, which is just an absurd statement.

02:22.720 --> 02:28.440
Prominent controversial conservatives like Alex Jones or Tommy Robinson were not destroyed by

02:28.440 --> 02:32.760
their own fans, but instead by progressives screeching that their opinions were too vile

02:32.760 --> 02:37.640
to ever allow to be spoken. And then that sentiment came for regular non-controversial

02:37.640 --> 02:42.560
conservatives, then centrists and liberals, and now it's finally affecting the big tent left,

02:42.560 --> 02:47.240
and they're not happy about it. One of Lindsay's friends, ContraPoints, pointed out on Twitter

02:47.240 --> 02:51.720
that there is a parallel between what she calls Diet Nazi Internet, which is literally

02:51.720 --> 02:56.720
just the people who troll and laugh on Chan sites, kiwi farms, and Encyclopedia Dramatica,

02:56.720 --> 03:02.240
and Twitter Wokescolds who anthologize a person's entire history of misdeeds and embarrassments.

03:02.240 --> 03:07.160
I have some sympathy for this position. Myself, Lindsay, and Contra are all old enough to

03:07.160 --> 03:12.160
have experienced our formative years offline and without social media. A lot of my embarrassing

03:12.160 --> 03:17.840
childhood and teenage moments are not immortalized as tweets or videos, to be brought up a decade

03:17.840 --> 03:23.920
later to destroy my adult life, but are simply hazy memories and funny stories. Or not so funny,

03:23.920 --> 03:28.920
as the case may be. However, ContraPoints believes that the parallel she draws means

03:28.920 --> 03:33.760
that cancel culture is not unique to the left. On the surface this makes a lot of sense. It may

03:33.760 --> 03:38.600
even have been an opinion I once held at one point, but I don't think so anymore. She brings

03:38.600 --> 03:43.680
up Gamergate as an example of right wing cancel culture, and again on the surface I see why.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.440
It was an angry group of gamers on the internet, yelling about how individuals within the subcultures

03:48.440 --> 03:52.440
of indie game development and games journalism were acting unethically, and therefore deserve

03:52.440 --> 03:57.440
to be out of a job. To compare, today's cancelling events are angry groups of progressives on the

03:57.440 --> 04:02.080
internet, yelling about how whatever celebrity or e-celebrity has said something bigoted,

04:02.080 --> 04:06.860
or defended the wrong person or take, or simply had an accusation even a false one flung at them,

04:06.860 --> 04:10.500
and therefore also deserve to be out of a job. But you can already see the difference, right?

04:10.500 --> 04:15.460
The core people involved in Gamergate actually acted unethically, and their customers responded

04:15.460 --> 04:20.300
with a consumer boycott. It's always seemed very strange to me that a rabidly anti-capitalist

04:20.300 --> 04:25.220
political camp would turn around and decry large swaths of normal, everyday,

04:25.220 --> 04:31.020
dare I say proletariat people engaging in a consumer boycott against the owners of capital,

04:31.020 --> 04:35.660
and instead actually side with those owners. Meanwhile most of today's cancel events don't

04:35.660 --> 04:41.140
seem to involve any kind of actual gamergate style ethical breaches. Piers Morgan was cancelled when

04:41.140 --> 04:45.780
he said that Meghan Markle's son couldn't become a prince, not due to racism, but due to the current

04:45.780 --> 04:50.540
laws of succession. Gina Carano was cancelled for a long list of tiny reasons regarding pronouns and

04:50.540 --> 04:55.620
tweets and whatever, but the big one was saying that today's mob mentality went too far, comparing

04:55.620 --> 05:00.220
it to Nazi Germany. Tucker Carlson seems to face a cancelling event once a year like clockwork.

05:00.220 --> 05:04.300
Dr. Seuss was cancelled over the content of books that are considered racist today,

05:04.340 --> 05:08.740
but were acceptable for the time period, and funnily enough, Disney has not been cancelled

05:08.740 --> 05:13.820
for the same thing regarding their old movies. Gabb and Parler were cancelled after the January

05:13.820 --> 05:18.580
6th Capitol riots, despite Facebook being a larger hub for the organization of that event.

05:18.580 --> 05:23.060
Troy Levitt was invited to resign from his job, working on the game Hogwarts Legacy,

05:23.060 --> 05:27.180
when people noticed he ran an anti-SJW YouTube channel back in the day. Keemstar,

05:27.180 --> 05:31.660
Pewdiepie and JonTron have all been cancelled multiple times. The list goes on, from Hollywood

05:31.660 --> 05:36.140
celebrities, to online personalities, to companies and products. The difference between these events

05:36.140 --> 05:40.620
and Gamergate is clear to me. These don't seem to involve any legal or ethical breaches,

05:40.620 --> 05:45.860
but rather differences of opinion over politics or philosophy or even art. I think this is why

05:45.860 --> 05:50.980
the pro-Jared situation felt different than your usual cancelling event, even though pro-Jared was

05:50.980 --> 05:54.820
obviously innocent in the end, and it's because he was actually accused of something that,

05:54.820 --> 05:58.580
if it were true, would have been a real violation and not something trumped up.

05:58.580 --> 06:03.460
Compare these two scenarios. In the first, a small YouTuber named Trillium, with less than

06:03.460 --> 06:08.500
5,000 subs, makes a video about how she doesn't like The Last of Us Part 2. Her take goes viral

06:08.500 --> 06:13.220
with both fans of Naughty Dog and progressives plugged into the culture war, and she catches so

06:13.220 --> 06:17.860
much flak that people dox her and she deletes her online presence and goes into hiding. In the

06:17.860 --> 06:22.500
second, Asmongold on stream goes over the blatant racism of one of Blizzard Entertainment's writers,

06:22.500 --> 06:27.460
Madeleine Roux, while noticing that she may be related to the senior vice president of HR. His

06:27.460 --> 06:32.220
fans notice a surprising amount of similar racism and sexism from other writers at Blizzard. In the

06:32.220 --> 06:36.300
first scenario, a person has an opinion about something innocuous that runs counter to the

06:36.300 --> 06:40.340
mainline progressive narrative, and they get harassed for it by a crowd of people largely

06:40.340 --> 06:44.260
unrelated to them. In the second scenario, a progressive within a position of power acts

06:44.260 --> 06:48.060
unethically and hypocritically, and their own consumer base shines a light on their bad

06:48.060 --> 06:52.660
behavior. The first scenario is cancel culture, because it's done by people wholly unrelated to

06:52.660 --> 06:56.900
the target for completely asinine reasons. The second scenario is accountability, because it's

06:56.900 --> 07:00.500
done by the people who consume the product created by the target, holding the belief that their own

07:00.500 --> 07:05.100
subculture is being weaponized against them by those in power. Of course, if you're a progressive,

07:05.100 --> 07:09.740
there seems to be all the motivation in the world to conflate these two things. A non-lefty gets

07:09.740 --> 07:14.100
canceled for ridiculous reasons? It's just consequence culture. It's accountability. You

07:14.100 --> 07:18.340
did something bad and deserve it for sure. A lefty gets held accountable for their own shitty actions?

07:18.340 --> 07:23.540
Oh no, cancel culture is at it again? I'm not at fault, it's those evil goobergators. But

07:23.540 --> 07:27.900
muddying the waters between these two things obscures their most important difference. While

07:27.900 --> 07:32.700
it's true that consequence culture, that accountability, that the consumer boycott is apolitical,

07:32.700 --> 07:38.500
as ContraPoints pointed out, cancel culture itself is specifically a product of progressivism. This

07:38.500 --> 07:43.060
is why whenever somebody is canceled over something benign, like both Lindsay Ellis and ContraPoints

07:43.060 --> 07:48.300
have been, it is always by their own progressive audiences. And in fact, whenever anybody of any

07:48.300 --> 07:52.940
political persuasion is canceled over something benign, it's always by a progressive mob. The

07:52.940 --> 07:58.540
people who wish to wield the justice of the mob against anybody on a whim have purposefully blurred

07:58.540 --> 08:04.180
the boundaries between canceling events and consumer boycotts. And with that merger now

08:04.180 --> 08:09.500
complete, you need not think about anything other than the politics of the parties involved. For

08:09.500 --> 08:14.580
example, was it cancel culture going too far, or just accountability in action when Jimmy

08:14.580 --> 08:20.060
Galligan held onto a three-second clip of a white teenage girl saying the n-word while singing along

08:20.060 --> 08:25.660
to a song, only to finally release it years later when that girl was an adult in order to foul her

08:25.660 --> 08:30.180
university admissions? Well, in the mindset of the progressive, we only need to understand the

08:30.180 --> 08:34.500
target's politics to know if it was deserved, or even worse, her race or gender. Now that we've

08:34.500 --> 08:39.660
stripped away the meaningful difference between canceling events and consumer boycotts, tribalism

08:39.660 --> 08:44.580
is all we have left. You can apply this framework to any event. Why did Justin Trudeau get away with

08:44.580 --> 08:49.700
blackface? Why did Sarah Jong not immediately lose her journalist job over old racist tweets

08:49.700 --> 08:56.140
when Alexi McCammond lost hers over her old racist tweets? Why did a literary agent get fired solely

08:56.140 --> 09:01.460
over owning a parlor account? The answer to each of these questions is, what tribe are you a part

09:01.460 --> 09:05.500
of? The problem with countering this type of conflation is that it can be really hard to

09:05.500 --> 09:10.220
discern the truth based on who's presenting the evidence. This video went viral last week,

09:10.220 --> 09:14.900
and it's an excellent example of what I mean. Tariq Wash Yoaz Nasheed posted,

09:14.900 --> 09:20.780
A white Holiday Inn Express worker has a nervous breakdown after he got scolded by a black customer

09:20.780 --> 09:22.620
because of a mistake in the reservation system.

09:40.220 --> 09:45.500
Did you get mad and hit the computer? I'm sure you're on camera, right? I'm sure you're on camera.

09:45.500 --> 10:10.660
So this is the type of people that have working here. Wow. You gotta be kidding me.

10:15.500 --> 10:27.660
Wow. And a lot of people lost it on Tariq for posting what is clearly a man having a nervous

10:27.660 --> 10:33.180
breakdown and making it about race. But a lot of people is not everybody. Somebody make sure this

10:33.180 --> 10:37.060
white boy don't have a gun. Would he have done that if the man wasn't black? He would have fixed

10:37.060 --> 10:40.980
the issue and moved on like he probably did countless of times before then. Black people

10:40.980 --> 10:45.780
are never afforded the grace of a public mental health meltdown. This man has mental health issues

10:45.780 --> 10:50.740
and shouldn't be in a public facing job. The black man who filmed feared for his safety.

10:50.740 --> 10:57.260
Hold on a second guys. I'm sick. I'm trying to record this video and somebody royally fucked up

10:57.260 --> 11:01.020
the SFO Minecraft server. I was mid recording and I had to go fix it. It took like an hour.

11:01.020 --> 11:05.540
This is going to be a big audio file. If you didn't know we had a community Minecraft server,

11:05.540 --> 11:09.740
well now you do. Join us sometime. In any case, from the progressive BIPOC lens,

11:10.060 --> 11:14.380
Tariq and the others are absolutely correct. This is a black person fearing for their lives

11:14.380 --> 11:18.180
and recording a potential white aggressors meltdown. However, from the progressive,

11:18.180 --> 11:23.100
ableist and queer centric lens, all of these people objecting to Tariq Nasheed are absolutely

11:23.100 --> 11:28.060
right too. This is a neuro atypical gay man being harassed by a privileged healthy straight

11:28.060 --> 11:32.820
oppressor who is about to use his own oppression to ruin his life. But neither of these are the

11:32.820 --> 11:38.460
correct lens to use. They each filter out important information. The first lens implies that if the

11:38.460 --> 11:43.300
races of the person recording the video and the hotel clerk were reversed, then suddenly it would

11:43.300 --> 11:47.300
be objectionable to record him. And Tariq would absolutely say so if that were the case. The

11:47.300 --> 11:52.140
second lens implies that it would be totally fine to cancel this person if he didn't have his mental

11:52.140 --> 11:56.180
problems. And yes, this is exactly how it's coming off to progressives who find themselves

11:56.180 --> 12:01.740
prioritizing race and losing that clash on this event. If he was just a normal white guy who

12:01.740 --> 12:06.620
wasn't mentally retarded or a gay freak or whatever, nobody would give a fuck. He would

12:06.620 --> 12:11.500
lose his job, and everyone would agree with Tariq. It is the use of these lenses that turns

12:11.500 --> 12:17.260
everything into a premeditated calculated strike with no room for the actual humanity of the people

12:17.260 --> 12:21.980
involved. Is no one going to point out that the reason the guy smashed the computer on his head

12:21.980 --> 12:26.180
is because he knew that the black guy was trying to frame him as a racist and destroy his life?

12:26.180 --> 12:30.980
That's the new strategy. If you can't defend yourself with words, just have an autistic mental

12:30.980 --> 12:34.780
breakdown. The quartering started up a GoFundMe in support of this guy, which has gained a lot of

12:34.780 --> 12:39.020
traction. But judging by his Reddit post history, he doesn't seem to want it. Since the event,

12:39.020 --> 12:43.740
he's been slowly spiraling into worse and worse depression, with the family of the guy who recorded

12:43.740 --> 12:47.780
him harassing him at his workplace, which he quit, as well as his home, threatening his life. And

12:47.780 --> 12:52.300
because legitimate consumer boycott has been merged with cancel culture, the only tool the

12:52.300 --> 12:56.980
progressive has left to judge whether or not this event was justice served or justice aborted is

12:56.980 --> 13:00.540
which progressive lens you think it's more appropriate to look through. Meanwhile, the

13:00.540 --> 13:05.860
individualist position rejects all of these lenses and simply says treat people like individuals. It

13:05.860 --> 13:10.260
doesn't matter if one's black and one's white. It doesn't matter if one has mental problems and the

13:10.260 --> 13:13.700
other doesn't. I mean, it might matter in terms of understanding why he had that kind of reaction,

13:13.700 --> 13:17.540
but it doesn't matter in terms of understanding whether or not he deserves to be dragged through

13:17.540 --> 13:22.620
the mud. And yes, for the progressive, it most certainly comes down to this type of tribalism

13:22.620 --> 13:28.540
rather than any actual interest in real wrongdoing. One can be strongly against a cancel culture and

13:28.540 --> 13:32.780
still support the cancellation of dangerous psychopaths. And who defines the psychopath Sam

13:32.780 --> 13:37.940
Harris? Would that be the progressives by any chance? And again, yes, the muddying effect I've

13:37.940 --> 13:43.700
been describing is real. Cancel culture in 2020 is exactly what political correctness was in 1990.

13:43.700 --> 13:47.780
It's a thing conservatives made up so they can pretend they are speaking truth to power and

13:47.780 --> 13:52.660
fighting for free speech when they are actually just being awful people. No, what's actually

13:52.660 --> 13:57.460
happening is that when people speak truth to your power, when they advocate for speech you don't

13:57.500 --> 14:02.980
like, the only thing you can do is conflate them with the idea of just being awful. Honestly,

14:02.980 --> 14:08.900
what a lot of this behavior stems from is simple narcissism. If you watch Lindsay Ellis's hour 40

14:08.900 --> 14:13.700
non-apology video, you can clearly see it. The whole thing is filled with digs and backstabs

14:13.700 --> 14:19.180
and humble brags and fake ass apologies. These are people who view themselves as the hero while

14:19.180 --> 14:23.980
simultaneously celebrating the shutting down of all opinions that go against them, the firing of

14:24.020 --> 14:28.380
all people who do not march in lockstep with them, and the subversion of all organizations

14:28.380 --> 14:33.300
and platforms to suit their needs. These are people who shriek bloody murder about the injustices of

14:33.300 --> 14:38.020
cancel culture when their Patreon is raking in $18,000 a month rather than the $20,000 they're

14:38.020 --> 14:42.860
accustomed to. All the while gleefully getting the assistant manager at Payless Shoes fired

14:42.860 --> 14:47.660
because he's sexist for posting on his private Twitter account that he doesn't like the new

14:47.660 --> 14:52.540
Star Wars movies. If progressives actually thought anybody I've talked about in this video has done

14:52.580 --> 14:56.700
anything wrong and they were actually interested in justice, they would talk to them. But it's not

14:56.700 --> 15:01.060
about peace and understanding, it's about control and dominance. Progressives are pushing an anti

15:01.060 --> 15:05.980
hierarchy philosophy and when your average rank-and-file progressive turns on the progressives

15:05.980 --> 15:10.140
at the top of the hierarchy, they're shocked it finally came for them. Here's where we are now.

15:10.140 --> 15:15.340
Your average person is no longer comfortable sharing their political views. This is not a

15:15.340 --> 15:21.020
good turn of events. Civil society survives when disagreements happen at the ballot box and during

15:21.020 --> 15:25.940
a debate. It crumbles when they happen in the streets and on the battlefield. But that is the

15:25.940 --> 15:30.060
future we're moving towards. A growing chorus of people who have survived the many repressive

15:30.060 --> 15:34.540
governments around the world have all been saying that what they see in cancel culture is the

15:34.540 --> 15:39.580
beginnings of a totalitarian regime. It's no surprise to me therefore that ContraPoints went

15:39.580 --> 15:46.180
on a podcast recently to advocate for Maoist style struggle sessions where a person accused

15:46.180 --> 15:52.100
goes through a revolutionary tribunal where they get raked over the coals by those who object to

15:52.100 --> 15:57.180
their past behavior so that they may come out the other side as a redeemed comrade. It feels like

15:57.180 --> 16:04.100
there is a cultural void when it comes to what penance and absolution looks like. The options

16:04.100 --> 16:11.580
are excommunication from society or no consequences whatsoever. Yeah I've actually had the thought

16:11.580 --> 16:20.820
that it would be better to have something like internet panels of restorative justice. Yes. And

16:20.820 --> 16:25.580
I know that probably sounds like super dystopian but I would argue it's way less dystopian than

16:25.580 --> 16:30.780
what we currently have. Like but if people who had you know so suppose someone's going through

16:30.780 --> 16:36.300
a canceling event I think we all know what that means at this point right. Oh the tweet is trending

16:36.300 --> 16:41.420
we're talking about it right. If we were able to kind of have I don't know like a live stream or

16:41.660 --> 16:47.340
something with a peacekeeper or mediator where like the person who is accused is sort of able

16:47.340 --> 16:52.460
to sort of I don't know face the people the group of people that's maybe hurt by this and like able

16:52.460 --> 16:58.060
to kind of try to understand where each other is coming from if we can see if this you know give

16:58.060 --> 17:03.060
some percent get try to get some sense for if the person who's you know who did blackface 20 years

17:03.060 --> 17:08.100
ago has actually moved on or not do they understand why this is bad like is you know have they done

17:08.100 --> 17:14.460
things in the time sense that would sort of be the opposite values of that in action. It's an

17:14.460 --> 17:21.980
online revolutionary tribunal. Yeah. And you know we'll have we'll have judges. Powdered wigs we

17:21.980 --> 17:28.500
gotta bring back the powdered wigs. We can do a little camp. Maybe it's like the three judges are

17:28.500 --> 17:33.340
all dressed differently and one has a powdered wig and another is wearing the the Mao outfit.

17:33.340 --> 17:40.020
This is the end point of the progressives cancel culture. They are fundamentally hypocritical and

17:40.020 --> 17:44.380
they want to affect everybody except themselves. However now that they're learning that it cannot

17:44.380 --> 17:49.740
not affect them they want to implement a dystopian apology process where the progressive gets to

17:49.740 --> 17:54.860
self-flagellate for the benefit of all for the crime of making a rape joke in 2009 and as for

17:54.860 --> 18:00.460
the unrepentant what do they get executed I mean they did in Maoist China they did during the

18:00.460 --> 18:04.620
French Revolution that's not going to happen now at least not online are they getting deleted off

18:04.620 --> 18:09.980
the internet maybe but all tech is a thing now Sarah Silverman properly identified that because

18:09.980 --> 18:14.340
progressives don't offer a path to redemption regular people are simply abandoning the

18:14.340 --> 18:19.220
progressive idea of justice and finding kinship elsewhere that's what bit shoot and mines and

18:19.220 --> 18:24.300
parlor are part of what I've been talking about here can be more properly explained in the article

18:24.300 --> 18:30.260
beating back cancel culture by Pedro Domingos in it he outlines a list of things you should

18:30.300 --> 18:35.740
do during a canceling event find your friends pick your battles know what to expect don't back down

18:35.740 --> 18:41.900
don't let them make it about you hold the moral high ground mock them mercilessly don't let their

18:41.900 --> 18:47.340
narrative outrun yours goad them into overreaching turn their weapons against them use the courts

18:47.340 --> 18:53.380
bring administrators around don't antagonize educate get the majority on your side and most

18:53.380 --> 18:57.740
importantly remember that most cancellation attempts end in failure if you're getting

18:57.740 --> 19:00.980
canceled you don't have to do all of these things but you do have to do most of them and really the

19:00.980 --> 19:05.140
most important one is remembering that most cancellation attempts end in failure how many

19:05.140 --> 19:09.740
times has Lindsay Ellis been canceled before she made this video like 15 most of them did nothing

19:09.740 --> 19:14.580
at all and that is how you have to approach getting canceled it can only truly stop you if

19:14.580 --> 19:18.300
you let it stop you I'm not saying you're gonna come out of it unscathed you may lose a friend or

19:18.300 --> 19:23.620
a job and that sucks but you can make new friends or land new jobs but if you capitulate to them you

19:23.620 --> 19:28.860
only make the losses more severe or even worse you begin to inflict them on yourself when I look

19:28.860 --> 19:33.260
at Domingos list I realize it's the complete opposite vision of what contra points espouse

19:33.260 --> 19:38.100
in that podcast with her struggle sessions the point of a struggle session is to lose to the

19:38.100 --> 19:43.020
mob so that you can be taught the lesson you need to learn the point of Domingos list is to oppose

19:43.020 --> 19:48.020
the mob because you don't agree there's anything that they can teach you and you know as dystopian

19:48.020 --> 19:53.300
as it sounds part of me loves the idea of attending an internet struggle session I would not mind the

19:53.300 --> 19:58.100
opportunity to tell all of these self-important losers off to their face to completely reject

19:58.100 --> 20:02.940
their conception of justice to let them know that I do not regret any of my past actions and to shove

20:02.940 --> 20:08.100
their opportunities of forgiveness up their cloacas I have no need to be absolved of my

20:08.100 --> 20:13.700
crimes by progressives vosh style because I have not committed any crimes at all yeah I do just

20:13.700 --> 20:18.820
want the opportunity to shit on the whole thing but talking seriously no internet struggle sessions

20:18.820 --> 20:22.860
are an awful dystopian idea from a group of people who cannot conceive of actually living

20:22.940 --> 20:28.380
in freedom cancel culture is just rebranded witch-hunting and it's one repressive practice

20:28.380 --> 20:33.700
of many that progressives have brought back from our past racism and sexism are okay again if it's

20:33.700 --> 20:38.540
directed towards white men sexuality is bad again not because of the conservative calling it

20:38.540 --> 20:44.180
ungodly but the progressive calling it objectifying stalking is okay again as long as you call it

20:44.180 --> 20:49.260
stanning being gay or trans is a choice again because the idea of immutable characteristics

20:49.260 --> 20:55.060
is now biological essentialism fighting fascism is now simply making a snarky post online it's

20:55.060 --> 20:59.460
somebody your favorite youtuber said is a Nazi and when you hit that send button it's almost like

20:59.460 --> 21:05.380
being there on D day freedom of expression is encouraged but only if living your best life means

21:05.380 --> 21:10.660
saying and doing things that progressives approve of every single problem I've listed off is a

21:10.660 --> 21:15.900
progressive problem and really there's no progress in it these are all rollbacks not advancements

21:15.900 --> 21:20.900
cancel culture as well as contra points is a struggle session solution for it are just

21:20.900 --> 21:26.140
modern-day drumhead trials there's no justice here nothing's improved nobody's wrongs are

21:26.140 --> 21:30.540
righted nobody deserves the punishments they get so when the mob comes for you tell them to fuck

21:30.540 --> 21:35.380
off even if they're right tell them to fuck off because you can privately take whatever legitimate

21:35.380 --> 21:40.660
criticism some of them may have without allowing them to destroy you don't be so pigheaded to

21:40.660 --> 21:44.820
assume that any person who speaks against you is out to destroy you that's a fast track to

21:44.820 --> 21:48.820
spoonieville but also don't let them use their honest attempt to point out a problem as a vector

21:48.820 --> 21:52.780
to actually harm you either this is advice that the progressive will never truly be able to accept

21:52.780 --> 21:58.060
because in blurring the boundaries between unjust cancellation and just accountability they've also

21:58.060 --> 22:02.160
blurred the boundaries between those who would point out their blind spots and those who would

22:02.160 --> 22:06.460
attempt to destroy them they have made it so that they can never again self-improve through a

22:06.460 --> 22:10.740
friend's honest criticism because that friend and now appears to them as the villain moving in for

22:10.980 --> 22:16.900
but here we're individualists not progressives and that problem isn't our problem we know the

22:16.900 --> 22:20.700
difference between a friend's criticism and an enemy's attack just as we know the difference

22:20.700 --> 22:25.140
between the consequences of a real mistake and angry people filling up our mentions or something

22:25.140 --> 22:29.100
that we still think is correct it doesn't matter if they appeal to the authority of numbers of

22:29.100 --> 22:34.780
their large mob against your lone opinion they may derisively call you protagonist brain that's

22:34.780 --> 22:39.180
only because they're all NPCs it doesn't matter if they appeal to the correct opinion or the proper

22:39.180 --> 22:45.180
politics they will call you Nazi or fascist or alt-right or whatever else solely out of desperation

22:45.180 --> 22:50.340
it might matter if they manage to worm their way into your IRL circles if they call your job or

22:50.340 --> 22:55.000
your family or your partner it's certainly possible to lose those things and that's no joke but if you

22:55.000 --> 22:59.620
remain on good terms with them if you let them know what's happening if you are a good honest

22:59.620 --> 23:04.260
trustworthy person they will side with their experience of you over what a random online

23:04.260 --> 23:09.180
person says any day and if they don't they probably weren't good for you in any case point

23:09.180 --> 23:14.700
is while the overbearing officer might say if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear to

23:14.700 --> 23:19.940
justify the state's unwarranted surveillance the Liberty focused argument regarding cancel culture

23:19.940 --> 23:24.980
is actually this sayings inverse if you have nothing to fear then you have nothing to hide if

23:24.980 --> 23:31.020
you are true in your convictions then show them no fear when the angry mob of people comes for you

23:31.020 --> 23:36.180
and you're certain you've done no wrong then anchor yourself right beside the truth and weather

23:36.180 --> 23:42.740
