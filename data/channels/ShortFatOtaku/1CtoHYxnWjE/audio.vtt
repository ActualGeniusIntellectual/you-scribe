WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
So, it seems like the Cuban people are currently engaged in a revolt against the communist

00:10.440 --> 00:11.440
government there.

00:11.440 --> 00:17.120
And I gotta say, if you ever want to see a bunch of progressives and libertarian socialists

00:17.120 --> 00:22.520
immediately turn into boot-looking tankies, all you have to do is bring up Cuba.

00:22.520 --> 00:26.760
People on the left talk about Cuban healthcare all the time, how it's free and universal

00:26.760 --> 00:27.760
and great.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.760
They've even heard trans activists talk about how they fund gender transitions.

00:31.760 --> 00:36.680
Of course, what actually happens is communist Cuba enslaves physicians, sending them abroad,

00:36.680 --> 00:39.600
stealing their wages and forcing them to act as spies.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.520
Cuba is known for sending doctors out to other countries to perform humanitarian work.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.920
And I'm sure in between the spying they actually do perform that work.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.400
But let's not pretend that that's anything more than propaganda.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.120
In fact, a lot of Cuba's doctors just seem to be regular people who wanted to go into

00:53.120 --> 00:54.900
the profession and help others.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.640
And they're forced by their government to do this sort of stuff.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.760
Cuba has long been renowned for its medical diplomacy.

01:00.760 --> 01:04.960
But according to a new report, some of the doctors themselves say conditions can be nightmarish,

01:04.960 --> 01:09.520
controlled by minders, subject to a curfew, and posted to extremely dangerous places.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.120
Dr. Daley Coro wanted to be an intensive care specialist.

01:13.120 --> 01:17.760
She said that after graduating she was told that if she went on a medical mission to Venezuela,

01:17.760 --> 01:19.760
she would gain experience in her chosen field.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.740
However, she found herself in a war zone, one in which she became accustomed to having

01:23.740 --> 01:24.880
a gun pointed at her.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.320
There were many criminal gangs.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.120
When they fought, they brought their injured to us because the local Venezuelan hospital

01:30.120 --> 01:32.180
had a police presence and we didn't.

01:32.180 --> 01:36.360
These kids would bring in a patient with 12 or 15 bullets in his body, point their guns

01:36.360 --> 01:37.900
at you, and say you had to save them.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.200
If he died, you would die.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.540
I had one with a bullet through the heart, another with five in the head.

01:42.540 --> 01:45.720
Some would be alive, but you knew that if they were not operated on within 20 minutes,

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
they would die.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.400
And we didn't have the necessary conditions.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.320
We didn't even have basic medicine.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.200
Once an ambulance was shot up by another gang and a Venezuelan doctor and the driver were

01:54.200 --> 01:55.200
killed.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.640
There was always the possibility that the rival gang might try to finish off the patient

01:57.640 --> 01:58.640
during the transfer.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.320
I had a situation where a rival gang came in and shot the patient dead.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.520
Here's another one's point of view.

02:03.520 --> 02:07.040
A Cuban-American doctor says that the left has a terrible blind spot for Cuba's health

02:07.040 --> 02:08.040
care system.

02:08.040 --> 02:13.560
Dr. Grazie Cristi, a Cuban-American doctor, had to explain why Cuba is a terrible, corrupt

02:13.560 --> 02:16.360
nation after Bernie Sanders praised Cuba's policies.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.000
To talk about health care in Cuba is to talk about one of the saddest things on earth.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.600
There is no health care in Cuba for regular people.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.360
There are clinics for foreign visitors and tourists, and there is one special hospital

02:26.360 --> 02:27.360
for the communist elite.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.200
The hospitals and clinics for everyone else are covered in roaches and rats and have no

02:31.200 --> 02:32.200
equipment.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
They have no medicine.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.200
They have no gauze.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.960
When a Cuban person in Cuba needs to have an operation, they call their family members

02:36.960 --> 02:41.380
here in Miami to send them gauze, syringes, suture material, and that's what they use

02:41.380 --> 02:42.760
in Cuba for operations.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.100
The Cuban people have nothing for themselves.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.620
Various socialist countries have a long history of doing this.

02:47.620 --> 02:52.660
They have a walled garden where Westerners can come in and observe the utopia in progress

02:52.660 --> 02:54.500
while the regular people suffer.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.820
And the current revolt against the government seems to be based in health care, at least

02:58.820 --> 02:59.820
partially.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.900
Thousands of Cubans take to the streets to demand the end of the dictatorship.

03:02.900 --> 03:07.820
In an unprecedented display of anger and frustration, thousands of people took to the streets Sunday

03:07.820 --> 03:11.580
in cities and towns across Cuba, including Havana, to call for the end of the decades-old

03:11.580 --> 03:16.740
dictatorship and demand food and vaccines as shortages of basic necessities have reached

03:16.740 --> 03:20.380
crisis proportions and COVID-19 cases have soared.

03:20.380 --> 03:24.620
And of course, because progressives are nothing if not hypocritical, suddenly all that open

03:24.620 --> 03:28.620
border stuff has vanished now that it's Cubans fleeing Cuba.

03:28.620 --> 03:32.300
Homeland Security Chief says the US will not give refuge to those fleeing Cuba and Haiti

03:32.300 --> 03:33.300
by boat.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.540
They will not be allowed to enter the US even if they demonstrate fear of being persecuted

03:36.540 --> 03:37.960
or tortured in their home countries.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.900
Allow me to be clear, if you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States.

03:40.900 --> 03:45.160
Now the reason that progressives absolutely hate the idea of ICE is that they deport illegal

03:45.160 --> 03:46.160
immigrants.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.020
And usually their outward-facing justification for this is that some of these illegal immigrants

03:50.020 --> 03:53.980
might actually be able to get refugee status, they just haven't gotten around to it yet.

03:53.980 --> 03:57.980
And downstream from that is the idea that it's a violation of international law if a

03:57.980 --> 03:59.480
country doesn't take refugees.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.000
But what is this?

04:01.000 --> 04:06.420
People who are fleeing Cuba, clearly refugees, from a repressive communist dictatorship.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.680
And now suddenly refugee status is out the window?

04:08.680 --> 04:13.040
Maybe it's because Cubans overwhelmingly vote Republican, even more so now that the Democrats

04:13.040 --> 04:15.360
are slowly being subverted by socialists.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.120
And this is how we get back to the breadtubers and the champagne socialists.

04:18.120 --> 04:23.160
These are people who, despite their anti-tanky rhetoric, are happy to sing Cuba's praises.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.160
I despise Guasanos.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.080
I don't even know how to pronounce that word, I hope Guasanos is good enough.

04:28.080 --> 04:32.540
They're some of the worst scum on earth, functioning as the base for the fascist far right in the

04:32.540 --> 04:37.360
US, and desiring nothing more than to extend that to the country they left when their slaves

04:37.360 --> 04:39.760
were liberated and lands were redistributed.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.840
Marco Rubio Ted Cruz types.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.720
Guasanos want to do to Cuba what fascist imperialists have done to Haiti and other countries in

04:46.720 --> 04:51.280
Central and South America, utterly destroy it and salt the earth so it can never again

04:51.280 --> 04:55.120
give hope to anyone in the region, but they will fail as they have for over half a century

04:55.120 --> 04:56.120
now.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.120
The verdict's in.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.500
If you're a Cuban who opposes leftism in all of its forms, if you oppose the authoritarianism

05:01.500 --> 05:06.800
and the communism of the Cuban regime, then not only are you a fascist, but you're a race

05:06.800 --> 05:08.280
traitor as well.

05:08.280 --> 05:13.340
So the word Guasano translates to worm, and according to the left at least back in 2015,

05:13.340 --> 05:18.560
it's used as an ethnic slur against Cubans, but now that it's a slur used exclusively

05:18.560 --> 05:23.260
by leftists at this point, it's not a slur at all, at least according to Hassan, though

05:23.260 --> 05:26.680
an even more ridiculous take comes from somebody who's replying to him.

05:26.680 --> 05:31.600
It's not even a slur, it's referring to class traitors specifically, literally you lose

05:31.600 --> 05:37.080
your latino card if you're a class traitor against the socialist revolution.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.000
But of course it's always been this way.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.840
Do you remember back during the 2020 election when Cuba overwhelmingly voted for Donald

05:42.840 --> 05:46.200
Trump, and then suddenly the left's racism was on display for all to see?

05:46.200 --> 05:49.880
The Cuban vote is not the Latino vote, Cubans have been sold a narrative that they have

05:49.880 --> 05:54.800
a guaranteed path to whiteness, and many will sell out every other minority to get it.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.760
Trump's appeal is the appeal of white supremacy.

05:56.760 --> 06:01.620
What's actually being said here is that Cubans are integrating into American society successfully,

06:01.620 --> 06:05.540
and so if you're going to have a career as being anti-American, you have to cover Cuban

06:05.540 --> 06:07.580
people in a layer of white paint.

06:07.580 --> 06:11.620
Whenever the left talks about this topic, there is absolutely a conflation between the

06:11.620 --> 06:15.640
Cuban racial and ethnic identity, and the politics of the Cuban government.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.500
To them, because Cuba is communist, you can't be a real Cuban if you're not.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.700
This one has to be the most ridiculous take though.

06:22.700 --> 06:26.220
It's worth remembering right now that the US intentionally developed a social support

06:26.220 --> 06:31.860
system for Cuban exiles, meant specifically to foster a US loyal Cuban population that

06:31.860 --> 06:35.780
would lend vocal support and an appearance of legitimacy to US interventionism.

06:35.780 --> 06:40.340
Ironically, a high degree of social investment on the government's part, used to naturalize,

06:40.340 --> 06:45.460
hose, and otherwise prepare Cubans for life in the US, galvanized one of the most aggressively

06:45.460 --> 06:50.420
reactionary populations in the country, and an obstacle to socialist gains here and in

06:50.420 --> 06:51.420
Cuba.

06:51.420 --> 06:55.100
Here is where you get that whole social democracy as the left edge of fascism point of view,

06:55.100 --> 06:56.640
which is absolutely ridiculous.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.020
But now we have some Cuban food mixed into it as well, I don't fucking know.

07:00.020 --> 07:05.440
Because this guy is literally complaining that Americans did what the left wants the

07:05.440 --> 07:10.180
American government to do, which is provide social support for these people, and those

07:10.180 --> 07:11.660
people are now thankful for it.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.660
And that's the problem.

07:12.660 --> 07:17.560
Listen, if you want a wild ride down this rabbit hole, head over to Wikipedia and look

07:17.560 --> 07:19.920
up the term social fascism.

07:19.920 --> 07:25.020
It's the idea that social democrats, you know basically welfare state dems, people who aren't

07:25.020 --> 07:28.020
socialist but they're certainly progressive and certainly on the left, people who want

07:28.020 --> 07:33.260
a liberal capitalist society but they also want scandinavia style social safety nuts.

07:33.260 --> 07:39.940
Those people are fascist because in alleviating the working class's woes, the working class

07:39.940 --> 07:44.320
will no longer want to revolt and impose a communist government.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.540
Literally helping people is reactionary when you want a revolution.

07:48.540 --> 07:52.000
So we've talked about the doctors thing and we've talked about the racism thing.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.740
What else is floating around the libertarian socialists when it comes to Cuba?

07:54.740 --> 07:58.140
Do you think it has something to say when it comes to Cuba having to resort to oxen

07:58.140 --> 08:02.460
rather than tractors to produce their food due to the slow decay of their society?

08:02.460 --> 08:06.980
I wonder if they have anything to say about how an ex-Cuban judge revealed secrets of

08:06.980 --> 08:08.500
how Cuba suppresses dissent.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.500
The repression that I am seeing against part of my people is not what I want for my people.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.540
I have a lot of fear about the future.

08:14.540 --> 08:16.300
Everyday Cubans face more fear.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.980
I don't want blood on the streets of Cuba.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.700
I don't want these imprisonments.

08:19.700 --> 08:24.380
He revealed that contrary to official public figures, the government hides secret information

08:24.380 --> 08:29.000
showing that they are holding thousands of inmates on dubious charges and has the highest

08:29.000 --> 08:31.420
incarceration rate in the world.

08:31.420 --> 08:36.580
The Prague's and the socialists also like to say that Cuba is anti-imperialist and that

08:36.580 --> 08:39.020
socialism in general is anti-imperialist.

08:39.020 --> 08:42.260
They of course conveniently forget, or it's more likely that they don't know because they're

08:42.260 --> 08:47.580
completely uneducated on everything they talk about, that Cuba invaded Angola from 1975

08:47.580 --> 08:53.620
to 1991 to help prop up that genocidal socialist regime and that socialists of the day called

08:53.620 --> 08:56.340
Cuban interventionism social imperialism.

08:56.340 --> 09:00.140
Maybe they'll blame it all on the American embargo dude.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.740
Because the United States, since I think JFK, has not allowed any trade with Cuba.

09:03.740 --> 09:06.780
Well actually that's a thing, it's an embargo not a blockade.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.160
They sometimes call it a blockade but again they're wrong.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.980
If it were a blockade that would mean that the US is surrounding Cuba with ships and

09:12.980 --> 09:15.340
not allowing anybody to trade with them.

09:15.340 --> 09:16.520
But that's not what's happening.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.060
The US has an embargo.

09:18.060 --> 09:21.540
That means that it's illegal for American companies to trade with Cuba.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.940
Not Canadian ones though.

09:22.940 --> 09:23.960
Not European ones.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.140
Not any other country.

09:25.140 --> 09:28.860
In fact those doctors from the start of the video, they got paid through Venezuelan oil

09:28.860 --> 09:31.360
money that Cuba and Venezuela traded.

09:31.360 --> 09:36.380
And in fact on the IMF's website you can see that Cuba still imports some stuff from the

09:36.380 --> 09:37.560
United States.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.560
Because guess what?

09:38.560 --> 09:40.420
It's not even a full embargo.

09:40.420 --> 09:44.900
So this idea that Cuba is simply withering on the vine because America has built a wall

09:44.900 --> 09:47.680
of ships around it is just ridiculous.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.760
This here might be the source of at least some of Cuba's problems.

09:50.760 --> 09:55.000
This is from Cuba's national office of statistics where it shows the Cuban regime investing

09:55.000 --> 10:00.620
almost 50 times more money in foreign investments in comparison to things like public health

10:00.620 --> 10:01.620
or education.

10:01.620 --> 10:05.680
Maybe this is why Cuba sucks so much and it's got nothing to do with those evil liberals

10:05.680 --> 10:06.740
in the West.

10:06.740 --> 10:13.560
So in the face of all this, all of these anti-authoritarian socialists, all of these true real left libertarians,

10:13.560 --> 10:17.260
you can watch them turn into tankies right before your very eyes.

10:17.260 --> 10:21.960
If any Cubans cry about fleeing Cuba because of communist oppression and fascist Fidel

10:21.960 --> 10:26.960
Castro, ask them why they didn't flee under Batista, the actual fascist dictator.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.800
Surely political suppression is bad in all forms, no?

10:29.800 --> 10:30.800
The Mao!

10:30.800 --> 10:32.680
Might makes right is good when we do it, huh?

10:32.680 --> 10:36.800
No, might makes right is good when it does the greatest amount of good for the greatest

10:36.800 --> 10:38.240
number of people.

10:38.240 --> 10:43.640
Literally advocating for a dictatorship if that dictator is of the same politics as you.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.640
Fucking insane, dude.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.420
Here's one of my tweets.

10:46.420 --> 10:50.460
When a socialist nation, oh, this was, I know this was one of Lance's tweets, but he deleted

10:50.460 --> 10:51.460
it.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.460
Oh my God.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.740
I guess it was that bad of a take, eh?

10:54.740 --> 10:58.100
When a socialist nation needs trade with a capitalist one to even stand a chance at existing,

10:58.100 --> 11:00.420
there might be some problems with their economic system.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.220
So what was that, that deleted Lance tweet?

11:02.220 --> 11:06.140
The one that he must have got so much hate for, for being that fucking stupid.

11:06.140 --> 11:08.220
By the way, Cuba has a vaccine.

11:08.220 --> 11:10.420
In fact, they have five.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.560
What they lack are syringes due in part to Trump era sanctions that Biden hasn't reversed.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.600
You know that you can quickly fact check this shit, right?

11:17.600 --> 11:22.660
You could have looked up, for example, that Bill Clinton signed in the year 2000 the Trade

11:22.660 --> 11:29.040
Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, which exempted both food and medical supplies

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
from the embargo.

11:30.040 --> 11:35.760
And in fact, at this point, the US is Cuba's largest food supplier and its fifth largest

11:35.760 --> 11:36.760
trading partner.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.820
They're literally only banning luxury goods and I think tourism now.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.860
It's a very bourgeois topic for the serfs to take up, eh?

11:43.860 --> 11:46.340
Let's not expect any consistency from Lance, though.

11:46.340 --> 11:50.340
I'm currently on his timeline right now, and here he is retweeting fascist sticking

11:50.340 --> 11:53.860
up for fascists regarding Cuban protesters in the United States.

11:53.860 --> 11:58.300
Another one, residents in Cuba have mobilized in defense of the revolution and against US

11:58.300 --> 11:59.300
intervention.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.740
You know, it's not really defense of the revolution anymore because the revolution's

12:01.740 --> 12:02.740
over.

12:02.740 --> 12:03.900
It happened 60 years ago.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.920
The people are now having a revolution against your faction.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.640
I had to say this before, all the way back in the conservatism is the new counterculture

12:10.640 --> 12:14.100
video, but you are not eternally the revolution.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.620
At some point, you become the establishment.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.940
You become old hat.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.680
You become the thing that free people rebel against.

12:20.680 --> 12:24.240
I mean, nobody's surprised that Lance is known to be a crypto tanky, right?

12:24.240 --> 12:28.480
You know, for all they're screaming about how there is no lib right, libertarians are

12:28.480 --> 12:32.660
just secret fascists or even liberals are fascists, centrists are fascists, everyone

12:32.660 --> 12:34.000
but them is a fascist.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.120
When all of these so-called libertarian leftists, lib socialists, whatever, when the chips are

12:39.120 --> 12:41.880
down, they're all fucking treadlickers.

12:41.880 --> 12:47.120
Black lives matter, despite being all about police brutality, and despite how many people

12:47.120 --> 12:52.600
the Cuban police have absolutely fucking butchered for no reason, has decided to come out in

12:52.600 --> 12:55.560
support of Cuba's communist regime.

12:55.560 --> 12:59.920
Cuba has historically demonstrated solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent,

12:59.920 --> 13:03.940
from protecting black revolutionaries to supporting black liberation struggles in Angola,

13:03.940 --> 13:06.580
oh yeah, where they were the imperialists.

13:06.580 --> 13:11.820
Nobody should be surprised that BLM goes thin blue line as soon as Cuba is involved.

13:11.820 --> 13:15.820
After all, they said as much back in 2016.

13:15.820 --> 13:20.240
The reason why this video is not about Cuban history specifically is because on that topic

13:20.240 --> 13:21.380
I only know so much.

13:21.380 --> 13:26.140
I do know that socialism has taken a prosperous society and turned it into a ruinous one,

13:26.140 --> 13:28.220
as it does everywhere it's tried.

13:28.220 --> 13:35.000
But this video is about how all of those hypocrites on the left, the progressives, the anarcho-communists,

13:35.000 --> 13:39.960
the libertarian socialists, all the people who claim to be anti-authoritarian, all of

13:39.960 --> 13:41.920
that stuff is just an aesthetic.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.020
It's surface level.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.260
Their real positions are what I've shown you here today.

13:45.260 --> 13:48.980
BLM is not anti-policing, they just want to be the ones in power.

13:48.980 --> 13:54.440
BreadTube is not actually anti-authoritarian, they simply want their camp to be the authority.

13:54.440 --> 13:59.460
These people will simp for the worst fucking regimes in human history as long as they're

13:59.460 --> 14:01.340
waving the correct flag.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.900
The most heinous violation of all though, the worst hypocrisy, is how these people can

14:05.900 --> 14:11.660
all claim to be sex-positive and still support the sex-negative Cuban government, who went

14:11.660 --> 14:17.100
on to blame Mia Khalifa, the porn actress, for all of their woes.
