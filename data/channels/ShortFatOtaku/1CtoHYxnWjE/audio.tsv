0	10440	So, it seems like the Cuban people are currently engaged in a revolt against the communist
10440	11440	government there.
11440	17120	And I gotta say, if you ever want to see a bunch of progressives and libertarian socialists
17120	22520	immediately turn into boot-looking tankies, all you have to do is bring up Cuba.
22520	26760	People on the left talk about Cuban healthcare all the time, how it's free and universal
26760	27760	and great.
27760	31760	They've even heard trans activists talk about how they fund gender transitions.
31760	36680	Of course, what actually happens is communist Cuba enslaves physicians, sending them abroad,
36680	39600	stealing their wages and forcing them to act as spies.
39600	43520	Cuba is known for sending doctors out to other countries to perform humanitarian work.
43520	45920	And I'm sure in between the spying they actually do perform that work.
45920	48400	But let's not pretend that that's anything more than propaganda.
48400	53120	In fact, a lot of Cuba's doctors just seem to be regular people who wanted to go into
53120	54900	the profession and help others.
54900	57640	And they're forced by their government to do this sort of stuff.
57640	60760	Cuba has long been renowned for its medical diplomacy.
60760	64960	But according to a new report, some of the doctors themselves say conditions can be nightmarish,
64960	69520	controlled by minders, subject to a curfew, and posted to extremely dangerous places.
69520	73120	Dr. Daley Coro wanted to be an intensive care specialist.
73120	77760	She said that after graduating she was told that if she went on a medical mission to Venezuela,
77760	79760	she would gain experience in her chosen field.
79760	83740	However, she found herself in a war zone, one in which she became accustomed to having
83740	84880	a gun pointed at her.
84880	86320	There were many criminal gangs.
86320	90120	When they fought, they brought their injured to us because the local Venezuelan hospital
90120	92180	had a police presence and we didn't.
92180	96360	These kids would bring in a patient with 12 or 15 bullets in his body, point their guns
96360	97900	at you, and say you had to save them.
97900	99200	If he died, you would die.
99200	102540	I had one with a bullet through the heart, another with five in the head.
102540	105720	Some would be alive, but you knew that if they were not operated on within 20 minutes,
105720	106720	they would die.
106720	108400	And we didn't have the necessary conditions.
108400	110320	We didn't even have basic medicine.
110320	114200	Once an ambulance was shot up by another gang and a Venezuelan doctor and the driver were
114200	115200	killed.
115200	117640	There was always the possibility that the rival gang might try to finish off the patient
117640	118640	during the transfer.
118640	122320	I had a situation where a rival gang came in and shot the patient dead.
122320	123520	Here's another one's point of view.
123520	127040	A Cuban-American doctor says that the left has a terrible blind spot for Cuba's health
127040	128040	care system.
128040	133560	Dr. Grazie Cristi, a Cuban-American doctor, had to explain why Cuba is a terrible, corrupt
133560	136360	nation after Bernie Sanders praised Cuba's policies.
136360	140000	To talk about health care in Cuba is to talk about one of the saddest things on earth.
140000	142600	There is no health care in Cuba for regular people.
142600	146360	There are clinics for foreign visitors and tourists, and there is one special hospital
146360	147360	for the communist elite.
147360	151200	The hospitals and clinics for everyone else are covered in roaches and rats and have no
151200	152200	equipment.
152200	153200	They have no medicine.
153200	154200	They have no gauze.
154200	156960	When a Cuban person in Cuba needs to have an operation, they call their family members
156960	161380	here in Miami to send them gauze, syringes, suture material, and that's what they use
161380	162760	in Cuba for operations.
162760	165100	The Cuban people have nothing for themselves.
165100	167620	Various socialist countries have a long history of doing this.
167620	172660	They have a walled garden where Westerners can come in and observe the utopia in progress
172660	174500	while the regular people suffer.
174500	178820	And the current revolt against the government seems to be based in health care, at least
178820	179820	partially.
179820	182900	Thousands of Cubans take to the streets to demand the end of the dictatorship.
182900	187820	In an unprecedented display of anger and frustration, thousands of people took to the streets Sunday
187820	191580	in cities and towns across Cuba, including Havana, to call for the end of the decades-old
191580	196740	dictatorship and demand food and vaccines as shortages of basic necessities have reached
196740	200380	crisis proportions and COVID-19 cases have soared.
200380	204620	And of course, because progressives are nothing if not hypocritical, suddenly all that open
204620	208620	border stuff has vanished now that it's Cubans fleeing Cuba.
208620	212300	Homeland Security Chief says the US will not give refuge to those fleeing Cuba and Haiti
212300	213300	by boat.
213300	216540	They will not be allowed to enter the US even if they demonstrate fear of being persecuted
216540	217960	or tortured in their home countries.
217960	220900	Allow me to be clear, if you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States.
220900	225160	Now the reason that progressives absolutely hate the idea of ICE is that they deport illegal
225160	226160	immigrants.
226160	230020	And usually their outward-facing justification for this is that some of these illegal immigrants
230020	233980	might actually be able to get refugee status, they just haven't gotten around to it yet.
233980	237980	And downstream from that is the idea that it's a violation of international law if a
237980	239480	country doesn't take refugees.
239480	241000	But what is this?
241000	246420	People who are fleeing Cuba, clearly refugees, from a repressive communist dictatorship.
246420	248680	And now suddenly refugee status is out the window?
248680	253040	Maybe it's because Cubans overwhelmingly vote Republican, even more so now that the Democrats
253040	255360	are slowly being subverted by socialists.
255360	258120	And this is how we get back to the breadtubers and the champagne socialists.
258120	263160	These are people who, despite their anti-tanky rhetoric, are happy to sing Cuba's praises.
263160	264160	I despise Guasanos.
264160	268080	I don't even know how to pronounce that word, I hope Guasanos is good enough.
268080	272540	They're some of the worst scum on earth, functioning as the base for the fascist far right in the
272540	277360	US, and desiring nothing more than to extend that to the country they left when their slaves
277360	279760	were liberated and lands were redistributed.
279760	281840	Marco Rubio Ted Cruz types.
281840	286720	Guasanos want to do to Cuba what fascist imperialists have done to Haiti and other countries in
286720	291280	Central and South America, utterly destroy it and salt the earth so it can never again
291280	295120	give hope to anyone in the region, but they will fail as they have for over half a century
295120	296120	now.
296120	297120	The verdict's in.
297120	301500	If you're a Cuban who opposes leftism in all of its forms, if you oppose the authoritarianism
301500	306800	and the communism of the Cuban regime, then not only are you a fascist, but you're a race
306800	308280	traitor as well.
308280	313340	So the word Guasano translates to worm, and according to the left at least back in 2015,
313340	318560	it's used as an ethnic slur against Cubans, but now that it's a slur used exclusively
318560	323260	by leftists at this point, it's not a slur at all, at least according to Hassan, though
323260	326680	an even more ridiculous take comes from somebody who's replying to him.
326680	331600	It's not even a slur, it's referring to class traitors specifically, literally you lose
331600	337080	your latino card if you're a class traitor against the socialist revolution.
337080	339000	But of course it's always been this way.
339000	342840	Do you remember back during the 2020 election when Cuba overwhelmingly voted for Donald
342840	346200	Trump, and then suddenly the left's racism was on display for all to see?
346200	349880	The Cuban vote is not the Latino vote, Cubans have been sold a narrative that they have
349880	354800	a guaranteed path to whiteness, and many will sell out every other minority to get it.
354800	356760	Trump's appeal is the appeal of white supremacy.
356760	361620	What's actually being said here is that Cubans are integrating into American society successfully,
361620	365540	and so if you're going to have a career as being anti-American, you have to cover Cuban
365540	367580	people in a layer of white paint.
367580	371620	Whenever the left talks about this topic, there is absolutely a conflation between the
371620	375640	Cuban racial and ethnic identity, and the politics of the Cuban government.
375640	380500	To them, because Cuba is communist, you can't be a real Cuban if you're not.
380500	382700	This one has to be the most ridiculous take though.
382700	386220	It's worth remembering right now that the US intentionally developed a social support
386220	391860	system for Cuban exiles, meant specifically to foster a US loyal Cuban population that
391860	395780	would lend vocal support and an appearance of legitimacy to US interventionism.
395780	400340	Ironically, a high degree of social investment on the government's part, used to naturalize,
400340	405460	hose, and otherwise prepare Cubans for life in the US, galvanized one of the most aggressively
405460	410420	reactionary populations in the country, and an obstacle to socialist gains here and in
410420	411420	Cuba.
411420	415100	Here is where you get that whole social democracy as the left edge of fascism point of view,
415100	416640	which is absolutely ridiculous.
416640	420020	But now we have some Cuban food mixed into it as well, I don't fucking know.
420020	425440	Because this guy is literally complaining that Americans did what the left wants the
425440	430180	American government to do, which is provide social support for these people, and those
430180	431660	people are now thankful for it.
431660	432660	And that's the problem.
432660	437560	Listen, if you want a wild ride down this rabbit hole, head over to Wikipedia and look
437560	439920	up the term social fascism.
439920	445020	It's the idea that social democrats, you know basically welfare state dems, people who aren't
445020	448020	socialist but they're certainly progressive and certainly on the left, people who want
448020	453260	a liberal capitalist society but they also want scandinavia style social safety nuts.
453260	459940	Those people are fascist because in alleviating the working class's woes, the working class
459940	464320	will no longer want to revolt and impose a communist government.
464320	468540	Literally helping people is reactionary when you want a revolution.
468540	472000	So we've talked about the doctors thing and we've talked about the racism thing.
472000	474740	What else is floating around the libertarian socialists when it comes to Cuba?
474740	478140	Do you think it has something to say when it comes to Cuba having to resort to oxen
478140	482460	rather than tractors to produce their food due to the slow decay of their society?
482460	486980	I wonder if they have anything to say about how an ex-Cuban judge revealed secrets of
486980	488500	how Cuba suppresses dissent.
488500	492500	The repression that I am seeing against part of my people is not what I want for my people.
492500	494540	I have a lot of fear about the future.
494540	496300	Everyday Cubans face more fear.
496300	497980	I don't want blood on the streets of Cuba.
497980	499700	I don't want these imprisonments.
499700	504380	He revealed that contrary to official public figures, the government hides secret information
504380	509000	showing that they are holding thousands of inmates on dubious charges and has the highest
509000	511420	incarceration rate in the world.
511420	516580	The Prague's and the socialists also like to say that Cuba is anti-imperialist and that
516580	519020	socialism in general is anti-imperialist.
519020	522260	They of course conveniently forget, or it's more likely that they don't know because they're
522260	527580	completely uneducated on everything they talk about, that Cuba invaded Angola from 1975
527580	533620	to 1991 to help prop up that genocidal socialist regime and that socialists of the day called
533620	536340	Cuban interventionism social imperialism.
536340	540140	Maybe they'll blame it all on the American embargo dude.
540140	543740	Because the United States, since I think JFK, has not allowed any trade with Cuba.
543740	546780	Well actually that's a thing, it's an embargo not a blockade.
546780	549160	They sometimes call it a blockade but again they're wrong.
549160	552980	If it were a blockade that would mean that the US is surrounding Cuba with ships and
552980	555340	not allowing anybody to trade with them.
555340	556520	But that's not what's happening.
556520	558060	The US has an embargo.
558060	561540	That means that it's illegal for American companies to trade with Cuba.
561540	562940	Not Canadian ones though.
562940	563960	Not European ones.
563960	565140	Not any other country.
565140	568860	In fact those doctors from the start of the video, they got paid through Venezuelan oil
568860	571360	money that Cuba and Venezuela traded.
571360	576380	And in fact on the IMF's website you can see that Cuba still imports some stuff from the
576380	577560	United States.
577560	578560	Because guess what?
578560	580420	It's not even a full embargo.
580420	584900	So this idea that Cuba is simply withering on the vine because America has built a wall
584900	587680	of ships around it is just ridiculous.
587680	590760	This here might be the source of at least some of Cuba's problems.
590760	595000	This is from Cuba's national office of statistics where it shows the Cuban regime investing
595000	600620	almost 50 times more money in foreign investments in comparison to things like public health
600620	601620	or education.
601620	605680	Maybe this is why Cuba sucks so much and it's got nothing to do with those evil liberals
605680	606740	in the West.
606740	613560	So in the face of all this, all of these anti-authoritarian socialists, all of these true real left libertarians,
613560	617260	you can watch them turn into tankies right before your very eyes.
617260	621960	If any Cubans cry about fleeing Cuba because of communist oppression and fascist Fidel
621960	626960	Castro, ask them why they didn't flee under Batista, the actual fascist dictator.
626960	629800	Surely political suppression is bad in all forms, no?
629800	630800	The Mao!
630800	632680	Might makes right is good when we do it, huh?
632680	636800	No, might makes right is good when it does the greatest amount of good for the greatest
636800	638240	number of people.
638240	643640	Literally advocating for a dictatorship if that dictator is of the same politics as you.
643640	644640	Fucking insane, dude.
644640	646420	Here's one of my tweets.
646420	650460	When a socialist nation, oh, this was, I know this was one of Lance's tweets, but he deleted
650460	651460	it.
651460	652460	Oh my God.
652460	654740	I guess it was that bad of a take, eh?
654740	658100	When a socialist nation needs trade with a capitalist one to even stand a chance at existing,
658100	660420	there might be some problems with their economic system.
660420	662220	So what was that, that deleted Lance tweet?
662220	666140	The one that he must have got so much hate for, for being that fucking stupid.
666140	668220	By the way, Cuba has a vaccine.
668220	670420	In fact, they have five.
670420	674560	What they lack are syringes due in part to Trump era sanctions that Biden hasn't reversed.
674560	677600	You know that you can quickly fact check this shit, right?
677600	682660	You could have looked up, for example, that Bill Clinton signed in the year 2000 the Trade
682660	689040	Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, which exempted both food and medical supplies
689040	690040	from the embargo.
690040	695760	And in fact, at this point, the US is Cuba's largest food supplier and its fifth largest
695760	696760	trading partner.
696760	700820	They're literally only banning luxury goods and I think tourism now.
700820	703860	It's a very bourgeois topic for the serfs to take up, eh?
703860	706340	Let's not expect any consistency from Lance, though.
706340	710340	I'm currently on his timeline right now, and here he is retweeting fascist sticking
710340	713860	up for fascists regarding Cuban protesters in the United States.
713860	718300	Another one, residents in Cuba have mobilized in defense of the revolution and against US
718300	719300	intervention.
719300	721740	You know, it's not really defense of the revolution anymore because the revolution's
721740	722740	over.
722740	723900	It happened 60 years ago.
723900	726920	The people are now having a revolution against your faction.
726920	730640	I had to say this before, all the way back in the conservatism is the new counterculture
730640	734100	video, but you are not eternally the revolution.
734100	736620	At some point, you become the establishment.
736620	737940	You become old hat.
737940	740680	You become the thing that free people rebel against.
740680	744240	I mean, nobody's surprised that Lance is known to be a crypto tanky, right?
744240	748480	You know, for all they're screaming about how there is no lib right, libertarians are
748480	752660	just secret fascists or even liberals are fascists, centrists are fascists, everyone
752660	754000	but them is a fascist.
754000	759120	When all of these so-called libertarian leftists, lib socialists, whatever, when the chips are
759120	761880	down, they're all fucking treadlickers.
761880	767120	Black lives matter, despite being all about police brutality, and despite how many people
767120	772600	the Cuban police have absolutely fucking butchered for no reason, has decided to come out in
772600	775560	support of Cuba's communist regime.
775560	779920	Cuba has historically demonstrated solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent,
779920	783940	from protecting black revolutionaries to supporting black liberation struggles in Angola,
783940	786580	oh yeah, where they were the imperialists.
786580	791820	Nobody should be surprised that BLM goes thin blue line as soon as Cuba is involved.
791820	795820	After all, they said as much back in 2016.
795820	800240	The reason why this video is not about Cuban history specifically is because on that topic
800240	801380	I only know so much.
801380	806140	I do know that socialism has taken a prosperous society and turned it into a ruinous one,
806140	808220	as it does everywhere it's tried.
808220	815000	But this video is about how all of those hypocrites on the left, the progressives, the anarcho-communists,
815000	819960	the libertarian socialists, all the people who claim to be anti-authoritarian, all of
819960	821920	that stuff is just an aesthetic.
821920	823020	It's surface level.
823020	825260	Their real positions are what I've shown you here today.
825260	828980	BLM is not anti-policing, they just want to be the ones in power.
828980	834440	BreadTube is not actually anti-authoritarian, they simply want their camp to be the authority.
834440	839460	These people will simp for the worst fucking regimes in human history as long as they're
839460	841340	waving the correct flag.
841340	845900	The most heinous violation of all though, the worst hypocrisy, is how these people can
845900	851660	all claim to be sex-positive and still support the sex-negative Cuban government, who went
851660	857100	on to blame Mia Khalifa, the porn actress, for all of their woes.
