00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Jonah Hill

00:05.720 --> 00:11.040
When I saw the search term Jonah Hill go viral on Twitter last week, for a minute there I

00:11.040 --> 00:14.160
thought this was going to be like the whole Seth Rogen thing from a couple years ago.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.800
Yeah, do you remember that?

00:15.800 --> 00:20.080
In the wake of the 2020 election, Seth Rogen was running around DMing people on Twitter,

00:20.080 --> 00:23.240
asking them if they were Jewish, including Count Dankula.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.400
Now I gotta admit, I used to be big fans of both Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.800
I love those 2000s and 2010s comedies they both made.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.120
In my mind, and I'm sure in many others, they're kind of cut from the same cloth,

00:34.120 --> 00:37.880
a part of the same era, which is probably why I made the knee-jerk connection.

00:37.880 --> 00:42.560
The last time Seth Rogen went viral, it was over his public meltdown when his god-awful

00:42.560 --> 00:44.780
show Santa Inc. was a failure.

00:44.780 --> 00:48.440
So when I saw Jonah Hill go viral, I was thinking that something similar had happened.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.620
He had abandoned what made him famous, made some garbage woke show or movie, and was now

00:52.620 --> 00:54.560
having a public hissy fit about it.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.080
But nope, it was something else entirely.

00:57.080 --> 01:03.280
Jonah Hill's ex-girlfriend posts his alleged texts, blasts him as a misogynist, oh boy,

01:03.280 --> 01:04.280
here we go.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.440
Jonah Hill's alleged dirty laundry is getting aired out by an ex, who's posting what she

01:08.440 --> 01:12.140
claims are a ton of old texts from him, and painting him as a toxic partner.

01:12.140 --> 01:17.160
Surf instructor Sarah Brady, his former flame of about a year from back in 2021, is dragging

01:17.160 --> 01:21.220
the actor publicly on her Instagram account, and she's not holding anything back in her

01:21.220 --> 01:24.960
repudiation of him as an alleged misogynist narcissist.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.160
Though for those of you who don't know, I certainly didn't because I tend not to follow

01:28.160 --> 01:31.160
celeb shit, Sarah Brady is a professional surfer.

01:31.160 --> 01:35.120
Presumably they met through some LA contacts or something when she was there at the time.

01:35.120 --> 01:39.480
She posted all of the proof of these claims as an Instagram story, which is very interesting,

01:39.480 --> 01:43.960
because Instagram stories automatically delete themselves after 24 hours.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.920
Thankfully everything was screencapped and uploaded elsewhere online.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.640
Here's the one that kicked everything off.

01:48.640 --> 01:53.880
In this text, Jonah is saying to Sarah, plain and simple, if you need surfing with men,

01:53.880 --> 01:57.920
boundary-less, inappropriate friendships with men, to model, to post pictures of yourself

01:57.920 --> 02:02.280
in a bathing suit, to post sexual pictures, friendships with women who are in unstable

02:02.280 --> 02:07.120
places, and from your wild recent past, beyond getting a lunch or a coffee or something respectful,

02:07.120 --> 02:09.060
I am not the right partner for you.

02:09.060 --> 02:13.800
If these things bring you to a place of happiness, I support it, and there will be no hard feelings.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.780
These are my boundaries for a romantic partnership.

02:16.780 --> 02:20.600
Sarah added the caption, see the misuse of the term, boundaries.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.720
Now here's the thing about boundaries in a relationship.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.960
They are necessarily arbitrary and restrictive.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.560
That makes them sound abusive, and they can be, but that's not a given.

02:29.560 --> 02:33.440
A boundary is arbitrary because it's based entirely on what the people in the relationship

02:33.440 --> 02:35.300
want, and it's going to be different for everybody.

02:35.300 --> 02:39.080
What cheating looks like in a monogamous relationship is going to look a lot different than what

02:39.080 --> 02:41.240
cheating looks like in an open relationship.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.800
One couple might be fine with casual drinking, but another couple might have somebody who's

02:44.800 --> 02:48.600
a recovering alcoholic or something, and maintains a strict rule that there's no drinking in

02:48.600 --> 02:52.360
the house, or you can't hang out with old drinking friends or something like that.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.520
Boundaries have to be arbitrary because people aren't all the same.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.440
A boundary is restrictive because, well, that's literally the point of it.

02:59.440 --> 03:03.160
It's drawing lines around behaviors that you don't want your partner to engage in.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.240
In a monogamous relationship, you don't want your partner fucking people behind your back.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.800
You are necessarily restricting them from that behavior.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.360
Now, just because violating a boundary that you've agreed to in a relationship isn't a

03:13.360 --> 03:17.100
moral act, this doesn't mean that your boundaries are moral in and of themselves.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.100
Here's an example.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.840
Let's say that you're deathly afraid of clowns, and you've set a hard boundary with your partner.

03:21.840 --> 03:22.840
No clown stuff ever.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.840
No jokes.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.840
No pranks.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.840
Or else you're done.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.920
If your partner pulls a clown prank on you, the immorality doesn't stem from the clown.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.280
The clown itself isn't immoral.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.880
It's the fact that your partner violated your boundary.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.880
That's immoral.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.380
In essence, your boundaries are the conditions of your consent.

03:36.380 --> 03:39.440
The relationship is intact only with the consent of both parties.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.540
If a boundary is crossed, then the consent is violated.

03:42.540 --> 03:47.080
This is because consent is fundamentally a deontological moral concept, based on rules,

03:47.080 --> 03:48.080
not outcomes.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.680
Something that I've talked about before.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.560
So going back to Jonah Hill's boundaries, even if I personally think some of them are

03:53.560 --> 03:54.560
a bit weird.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.760
For example, I wouldn't demand of my partners not to post pics to social media of them in

03:57.760 --> 03:58.760
bathing suits.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.800
What matters is that he made them clear.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.440
Sarah knew what they were, and as we'll see in a bit, she violated them anyway.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
That's a two-way street.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.040
She can also have boundaries that he must agree to in order for him to date her too.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.440
But that's not how she reacted.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.000
Her narrative about this whole thing is that the boundaries themselves are abusive.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.820
Well, let's see her evidence.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.720
This is a warning plan to all girls.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.560
If your partner is talking to you like this, make an exit plan.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.560
Love y'all.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.840
It's a bit hard to see, but Jonah is basically asking her to take down pictures of her surfing

04:24.840 --> 04:25.840
in a bathing suit.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.640
He's saying he's done with explaining himself.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.240
She's asking what he wants pulled down.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.040
He's saying the one with her ass out, and that there's tons of them going back months.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.660
Again, it's not something that I would do, but this is pretty common for more conservative-oriented

04:35.660 --> 04:36.660
people to want.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.060
And he did communicate that it was a deal-breaker for him.

04:39.060 --> 04:43.940
This is obviously not a case of abuse, but rather of them simply being mismatched partners.

04:43.940 --> 04:47.860
If he doesn't like his girl being in public in a swimsuit and her thing is being a pro

04:47.860 --> 04:50.640
surfer and posting it to Instagram, nobody's wrong here.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.860
They're just incompatible.

04:51.860 --> 04:54.500
You can make the argument that he should have known what he was getting into, but you can

04:54.500 --> 04:57.620
also make the argument that she should have known what she was getting into as well.

04:57.620 --> 05:00.860
Sarah then posts this message from her to her friend.

05:00.860 --> 05:05.220
It's kind of unbelievable that a man who sent me shit like this, it's Jonah sending her

05:05.220 --> 05:09.220
heart emojis over a pic of her in a swimsuit, would then be upset that I didn't read his

05:09.220 --> 05:13.000
mind and take down pics of that once I was in a relationship with him.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.980
You can read this sentence in two ways.

05:14.980 --> 05:18.240
The first way is that Sarah simply wasn't told to take down the pics, hence why she

05:18.240 --> 05:20.640
says that she didn't read his mind and take them down.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.860
This makes Jonah sound unreasonable that he didn't communicate his boundaries to her

05:23.860 --> 05:25.720
and that she would have had she known.

05:25.720 --> 05:30.040
The second way to read it is that I didn't read his mind and I didn't take down the pics

05:30.040 --> 05:31.600
are two separate actions.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.120
That the mind-reading comment is used to deflect away from her not doing what he wants.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.700
Reading it this way, it sounds like even if she knew that's what he wanted specifically,

05:39.700 --> 05:40.700
she still wouldn't have done it.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.180
Because it's not just the mind-reading that's objectionable, it's the taking down of the

05:44.180 --> 05:45.180
pics itself.

05:45.180 --> 05:48.800
There's not enough context here to truly know what she means, but of course, she paints

05:48.800 --> 05:50.540
Jonah in the worst possible light.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.300
And then there's this exchange.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.300
Jonah sent her this long text.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.300
You're right.

05:54.300 --> 05:58.540
We can't do surf social things or develop trust until you consider me and make decisions

05:58.540 --> 06:00.260
that give regard to our relationship.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.740
I've been as vulnerable as possible and I'm telling you I'm needing you to step up to

06:03.740 --> 06:05.780
the plate, which you can, I'm sure of it.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.500
But these losers don't get your time if you want me.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.740
Straight up, it's consideration.

06:09.740 --> 06:13.900
I respect your love of surfing, but I respect myself as well, and your love of surfing and

06:13.900 --> 06:17.720
being in those situations and lack of awareness are not mutually exclusive.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.720
This isn't me.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.020
I have my own issues that I own.

06:20.020 --> 06:23.540
If you want marriage and family, you can't use the 25 card.

06:23.540 --> 06:24.760
Step up and cut shit.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.500
These people don't get your time or your kindness at the sacrifice of minds.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.500
She's actually cut off Jonah's messages in every single screencap, which is kind of fishy

06:31.500 --> 06:34.360
in and of itself, but she adds another of her own captions here.

06:34.360 --> 06:39.080
By these people, he meant any friends of mine that he hadn't personally approved of.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.760
Jonah's clearly trying to paint him as this abuser who's keeping her away from her friends.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.760
But read it again.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.020
He's not saying don't you dare talk to them anymore.

06:46.020 --> 06:49.100
He's saying these losers don't get your time if you want me.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.960
The option to walk away and keep her friends is right there on the table.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.160
We again don't have the full context, but it's entirely possible that Jonah has a good

06:55.160 --> 06:58.320
reason for not wanting these people in his life and it's his right to walk away from

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
them.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.040
In this case, this is him extending a hand to her and seeing if she wants to walk with

07:02.040 --> 07:03.040
him.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.120
That 25 card comment also sounds a bit odd in a context.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.280
At this point, I think she was 25 years old and he was 37.

07:09.280 --> 07:13.440
The age gap and the experience gap and the wealth gap are all power imbalances in their

07:13.440 --> 07:18.080
relationship and my intuition tells me that it's possible in previous arguments she leaned

07:18.080 --> 07:22.320
on her age to explain some part of her behavior or her lifestyle or something, which might

07:22.320 --> 07:24.400
be what he's calling the 25 card.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.400
We just don't know.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.520
This is why I try not to prejudge a relationship based on a viral story or a clip, like for

07:29.520 --> 07:32.020
example that Steven Crowder thing from a few months ago.

07:32.020 --> 07:35.560
You can't get the full deep knowledge of a romantic partnership watching a couple of

07:35.560 --> 07:36.960
curated clips.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.080
And of course there's a bunch of weird me too women on the internet who are blindly

07:41.080 --> 07:44.860
coming to our defense and talking about how scary it is that men don't see a problem with

07:44.860 --> 07:46.840
putting boundaries up in relationships.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.400
Like check this chick out.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.360
If you would have told me yesterday I would wake up today upset with Jonah Hill, I would

07:52.360 --> 07:53.360
have called you a liar.

07:53.360 --> 07:57.200
How are you going to tell a surfer to stop surfing when she was already surfing when

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
you met her?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
That's what kills me.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.800
It's like you knew who you were, right?

08:01.800 --> 08:02.960
Like you knew who?

08:03.000 --> 08:08.640
I don't know why people want a bad bitch and then they get one and they want her to be

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
Amish.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.640
No disrespect to the Amish, but perhaps me and Sarah, I'm putting myself in there.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.640
Bad bitchery.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.680
Me and Sarah are not partial to the Victorian bonnet.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.680
You know what I'm talking about?

08:18.680 --> 08:24.860
The weaponizing of therapy talk is crazy because you're learning terminology you use in therapy

08:24.860 --> 08:28.200
to get someone to stop doing what they love.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.840
That's crazy.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.840
That's crazy.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.560
Also, those are not boundaries, those are not boundaries.

08:35.560 --> 08:37.600
Like I'm so glad you're in therapy.

08:37.600 --> 08:42.520
Man, it's actually entirely reasonable to expect that a person's behaviors change in

08:42.520 --> 08:45.500
between being in a relationship and being single.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.580
If you're sleeping around when you're single, do you think you should just continue to sleep

08:48.580 --> 08:49.580
around once you're taken?

08:49.580 --> 08:52.320
Like, nah, I'm not going to change for no man, I'm a strong independent woman.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.480
Yeah, you can be fucking independent all right.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.720
After this story went viral, Jonah messaged Sarah to basically say, not cool, dude.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.200
But even here, he's actually not saying anything wrong.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.420
He's not blowing up, he's not throwing anything in her face.

09:03.420 --> 09:05.420
He's saying he's hurt, he's disappointed.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.720
He's sorry that it hurts her that he's moving on, but he's actually innocent of any wrongdoing.

09:09.720 --> 09:13.280
In fact, this entire time, everything that I've seen from him has been reasonable.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.900
He set his boundaries, he's enforced his boundaries, and he's moved on when she wasn't the right

09:16.900 --> 09:17.900
one for him.

09:17.900 --> 09:21.380
And she's coming out of the woodwork two years later, seemingly because she's just bitter

09:21.380 --> 09:22.380
about it all.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.940
And I do think it's just bitterness, by the way.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.640
Even though Sarah Brady's social media presence has increased tenfold due to this event, Jonah

09:29.640 --> 09:32.520
Hill hasn't been canceled or metooed or anything.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.280
Once the story failed to gain the traction that she wanted, Sarah began to make social

09:36.280 --> 09:40.840
media posts like Boycott Stutz, Stutz is a new Netflix documentary that Jonah's a part

09:40.840 --> 09:45.920
of, or vague posts like this, where she says, when I choose both revenge and healing.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.820
A couple of days ago, she even posted this update, proclaiming that she got Jonah banned

09:49.820 --> 09:51.540
from Hawaiian beaches.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.080
Since the breakup, she had moved to Hawaii to further her surfing career.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.020
Oh, here's a fun bit of trivia.

09:56.020 --> 09:59.860
Also a couple of days ago, Sarah Brady dropped another set of embarrassing DMs, but this

09:59.860 --> 10:02.460
time about a different ex-boyfriend.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.460
Jackson Hinkle.

10:03.460 --> 10:06.820
Yes, the pro-Russia mega-communist dipshit.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.300
That Jackson Hinkle.

10:08.300 --> 10:12.180
Apparently he was a full-on socialist on the left back in 2020, but the relationship between

10:12.180 --> 10:16.940
Hinkle and Sarah apparently left her with PTSD, which she confirmed in long reams of

10:16.940 --> 10:19.340
texts, making fun of him to her friends.

10:19.340 --> 10:24.680
It's so weird that we live in a world where Jackson Hinkle and Jonah Hill are Eskimo brothers.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.920
It's pretty clear at this point that Sarah is just a clout-chaser who's dropping DMs

10:27.920 --> 10:30.240
and tearing others down in order to pull herself up.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.180
But because this is how canceling works, once somebody's on the ropes, you pile on.

10:34.180 --> 10:39.240
A few days after this story went viral, Zoey 101 star Alexa Nicholas accused Jonah Hill

10:39.240 --> 10:43.440
of forcing himself on her when she was 16 and he was 24.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.040
That's 15 years ago, guys.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.280
Back in 2008.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.960
Why the fuck did you wait this long to talk about it if it actually happened?

10:49.580 --> 10:50.580
Are you maximizing clout?

10:50.580 --> 10:51.900
Or maybe you're just making it up?

10:51.900 --> 10:53.940
All right, let's read her story.

10:53.940 --> 10:58.260
After reading Sarah Brady's admirable post about Jonah Hill, I just got a say.

10:58.260 --> 11:02.260
When I was 16, I got invited to a house party at Justin Long's house where he was living

11:02.260 --> 11:05.340
with some lame predator actor from CSI Miami.

11:05.340 --> 11:08.660
Jonah seemed to have his eyes on me because at one point I wanted a cigarette and he said

11:08.660 --> 11:10.340
he had one in his car right outside.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.340
Didn't seem like too much of an effort, so I trusted him.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.920
I went outside and he grabbed the cigs from his front seat.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.420
Jonah Hill, notice how she's hashtagging each post, didn't hand me the cig, which

11:18.440 --> 11:19.560
I thought was weird.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.080
And then as we walked back to the door, I asked him for it and he said nothing, but

11:23.080 --> 11:25.600
slammed me to the door and shoved his tongue down my throat.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
I was so appalled.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.200
I pushed him off and ran inside.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.340
Dude, this is the most that happened story I've ever heard in my entire life.

11:32.340 --> 11:36.560
This chick, Alexa Nicholas, she's also got a history of just accusing people of shit

11:36.560 --> 11:37.560
like this.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.280
Listen to her appearance on this podcast.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.400
You're 16 years old.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.120
You message Mike because you don't see he has like any tour dates and you're like, I

11:43.120 --> 11:44.120
would like to see this guy.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.120
He's got great music.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.460
I get a response like quickly back and like, what's his response?

11:48.460 --> 11:49.460
It's friendly and everything.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.620
As for my phone number right away, right away.

11:52.620 --> 11:53.940
And at this point you're like 16.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.380
How do you know how old he was like?

11:55.380 --> 11:56.380
He was 33.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.100
Oh my God.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.020
He's three years older than I am now.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.420
I'm still not even the age that he was then.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.420
Never.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.420
Oh wow.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.420
That is so.

12:05.420 --> 12:11.460
Let me tell you at 30 right now, there is no way in hell that I would ever talk to a

12:11.460 --> 12:16.800
16 year old unless it ends up being my daughter's friend and they're over for a play and like

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
there was no power.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.720
There was no education around power dynamics yet.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.720
Grooming.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.520
I didn't even know what the fuck that was, which is horrible that I grew up in an era

12:23.520 --> 12:26.200
where I didn't even know what grooming was.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.200
So I didn't know.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.540
I just thought, Oh, this is a guy.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.860
He makes music that I like and super friendly, totally.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.420
So I gave him my phone number.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.800
He called me like five minutes later.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.800
Dude.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.800
All right.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.440
This chick's apparently been stalked or groomed or whatever twice by the time she's 16.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.220
She's apparently heading out to parties with booze and cigarettes.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.220
Yeah.

12:45.220 --> 12:46.660
She's legally still a kid at 16, but come the fuck on.

12:46.660 --> 12:47.700
What were you doing there?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.940
She was literally the bad kid that everyone tells you not to be and not to hang around.

12:50.940 --> 12:55.080
Also, all of this stuff is coming out around the same time that she's announcing a new

12:55.080 --> 12:58.500
show called Eat Predators, which is all about sexual predators.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.820
The very topic she's going around talking about and trying to get attention on her for.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.780
A show that nobody gives a shit about.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.300
3000 subs, less than a thousand views each episode.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.300
Okay.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.300
Yeah.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.700
She's literally just grifting and trying to get a spotlight on her shitty failed show.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.420
I see no reason to pretend any of her stories are real.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.640
I don't usually talk about celebrity nonsense on this channel because I generally don't

13:16.640 --> 13:17.640
care.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.260
But as always, as a deeper conversation here in the text, it's clear, in my opinion, anyway,

13:21.260 --> 13:25.040
that Jonah is putting boundaries on Sarah's behavior that he deems appropriate.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.720
Remember, she can do the same to him, but instead she's calling that abusive and dragging

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
him online for it.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.200
Claiming he's a misogynist and a narcissist and worst of all, a conservative.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.080
But also what's really noteworthy is that she accuses him of weaponizing therapy against

13:37.080 --> 13:38.080
her.

13:39.060 --> 13:42.380
And he was bringing up conversations and concepts from those sessions.

13:42.380 --> 13:46.940
Now it's entirely possible to weaponize therapy, especially couples therapy, and it's insidious

13:46.940 --> 13:49.180
because it has an air of authority around it.

13:49.180 --> 13:52.780
The therapist said that you do X makes it sound like a therapist is on your side and

13:52.780 --> 13:54.500
the other person is just the problem.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.660
And any disagreement can be washed away in the flood of having an educated official back

13:57.660 --> 13:58.660
up your claim.

13:58.660 --> 14:03.040
One of the most effective ways to gaslight people is to do so with the apparent backing

14:03.040 --> 14:04.800
of professional expertise.

14:04.800 --> 14:09.380
But this also describes how Sarah's supporters came out and weaponized the therapeutic process

14:09.380 --> 14:10.380
in the same way.

14:10.380 --> 14:11.660
Like, listen to this soy boy.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.980
Jonah Hill was using therapy speak to control his girlfriend Sarah, his now ex-girlfriend,

14:16.980 --> 14:21.240
and it's important that we go over this misuse of therapy language, which is kind of a thing

14:21.240 --> 14:26.860
these days, and how it can be super problematic as it masks controlling behavior under a commonly

14:26.860 --> 14:32.400
accepted positive concept, in this case boundaries, making it harder for the person on the receiving

14:32.400 --> 14:34.620
end, Sarah, to challenge it.

14:34.620 --> 14:39.680
Okay, so Jonah is basically telling his professional surfer girlfriend, I am not going to be with

14:39.680 --> 14:45.520
you if you surf with men, have boundaryless friendships with men, model, post pictures

14:45.520 --> 14:51.240
in a bathing suit or post suggestive pictures and are friends with women who are in unstable

14:51.240 --> 14:52.240
places.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.480
He goes on to say that these are my boundaries for a romantic relationship.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.360
He's straight up saying that Jonah is doing what Sarah did and what Sarah supporters are

15:00.360 --> 15:01.360
doing, including him.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.000
This is the Spiderman meme.

15:03.060 --> 15:07.460
Jonah's use of the term boundaries in this message is a misuse of the concept.

15:07.460 --> 15:12.820
A boundary is a healthy limit a person sets for themselves to protect their well-being

15:12.820 --> 15:13.820
and integrity.

15:13.820 --> 15:18.140
It is a rule or guideline that one creates to identify reasonable, safe, and permissible

15:18.140 --> 15:23.620
ways for others to behave towards them and how they'll respond when someone passes those

15:23.620 --> 15:24.620
limits.

15:24.620 --> 15:29.580
However, in the message Jonah sent to Sarah, he is not setting boundaries that protect

15:29.580 --> 15:31.100
his emotional well-being.

15:31.200 --> 15:36.520
Instead, he is dictating what behaviors and friendships Sarah is permitted to have.

15:36.520 --> 15:42.240
He's essentially instructing Sarah on who she can be friends with, what she can do professionally,

15:42.240 --> 15:45.080
and how she can show up online.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.920
This is not an example of healthy boundary setting.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.480
Instead, it reflects an attempt at control.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.840
It demonstrates a lack of respect for Sarah's autonomy and individuality.

15:54.840 --> 16:00.020
Jonah's message is more about restricting Sarah's behavior to suit his comfort levels

16:00.020 --> 16:04.880
and insecurities rather than expressing his feelings or needs in a healthy manner.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.880
Those are the same thing.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.580
He's describing the exact same thing, he's just using more positive and more negative

16:09.580 --> 16:12.440
language in the two examples because he's clearly biased.

16:12.440 --> 16:17.000
Jonah has established reasonable, safe, and permissible ways for others to behave towards

16:17.000 --> 16:19.800
him and how he'll respond when they pass those limits.

16:19.800 --> 16:24.080
But that necessarily means restricting her behavior to suit his comfort level.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.100
Like I said back at the start of the video, that's what a boundary is.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.100
That is its purpose.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.400
You don't get to unilaterally be in a relationship with somebody while violating all of their

16:32.400 --> 16:35.600
boundaries and then cry foul when they break it off with you.

16:35.600 --> 16:39.360
I have a lot to say about weaponizing expertise, specifically weaponizing therapy.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.140
I'm still getting through Dr. Thomas Saz's book on the topic, but this is like straight

16:43.140 --> 16:44.840
out of the Modern Abusers Handbook.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.720
To say that because you know more about a specialized field, like psychology for example,

16:48.720 --> 16:52.680
your expertise should be deferred to, all the while misusing that trust.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.920
The truth is, in my view, therapeutic terms and the weight that they carry should probably

16:56.920 --> 17:00.060
not be taken out of the therapeutic setting, at least not commonly.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.020
It's very easy to weaponize psych knowledge to attack somebody.

17:03.020 --> 17:06.700
Like my psych textbook describes narcissism and you display these traits, so it's not

17:06.700 --> 17:09.980
enough that I don't like you or that you are a bad boyfriend, but you're a narcissist.

17:09.980 --> 17:13.260
You might be, who knows, but you're not making that declaration in good faith.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.060
You're doing it because you're weaponizing your knowledge to fuck with somebody you're

17:16.060 --> 17:18.540
mad at for moving on and leaving you behind.

17:18.540 --> 17:22.740
It's common practice to just disbelieve me too stories at this point because, despite

17:22.740 --> 17:26.520
the Weinstein's and the Epstein's of the world, a lot of them did turn out to be bullshit.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.480
When you look at the Jonah Hill story, it is simply just a messy celeb breakup where

17:30.480 --> 17:32.800
the girl is mad about it years later.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.000
Even if Jonah did something wrong, it's only minor and certainly not worth trying

17:36.000 --> 17:37.180
to blow up online.

17:37.180 --> 17:40.960
But in my opinion, the greatest sign that one of these stories is actually just a bunch

17:40.960 --> 17:44.380
of trumped-up garbage is that they weaponize therapeutic language.

17:44.380 --> 17:46.080
That's the kicker here.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.340
Somebody who weaponizes therapeutic language doesn't simply want a guy canceled.

17:49.340 --> 17:51.980
They don't just want him slandered as an abuser.

17:51.980 --> 17:55.640
They want to invoke the weight of an armchair diagnosis, like there's something deeply

17:55.640 --> 17:56.960
wrong with him at his core.

17:56.960 --> 18:01.060
He's not just a shitty ex, he's a narcissist or he's a sociopath, bringing in the added

18:01.060 --> 18:02.880
condemnation of mental health stigma.

18:02.880 --> 18:07.160
Which is wild to me, considering that lefties often try to destigmatize mental health problems.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.480
At least in other scenarios where it benefits them to do so.

18:09.480 --> 18:13.260
In any case, Jonah Hill didn't do anything wrong, and if he somehow loses jobs or money

18:13.260 --> 18:15.960
for this shit show, he should probably sue her for defamation.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.760
Just like how the leftoids have been taking other cultural L's recently, this shit is

18:19.760 --> 18:23.080
unacceptable and we really gotta start slapping it down harder.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.440
Alright guys, that about does it for me, thanks for watching the whole video if you're

18:26.440 --> 18:27.440
here at the end.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.480
I'm playing more Zelda again on stream tonight, so if you're watching this on release, come

18:31.480 --> 18:33.240
by and say hi.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.600
My girlfriend would be there too.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.000
So I'll see you there.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.440
Have a good one guys, I love you.
