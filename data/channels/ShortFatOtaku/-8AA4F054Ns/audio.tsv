0	5720	Jonah Hill
5720	11040	When I saw the search term Jonah Hill go viral on Twitter last week, for a minute there I
11040	14160	thought this was going to be like the whole Seth Rogen thing from a couple years ago.
14160	15800	Yeah, do you remember that?
15800	20080	In the wake of the 2020 election, Seth Rogen was running around DMing people on Twitter,
20080	23240	asking them if they were Jewish, including Count Dankula.
23240	27400	Now I gotta admit, I used to be big fans of both Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.
27400	30800	I love those 2000s and 2010s comedies they both made.
30800	34120	In my mind, and I'm sure in many others, they're kind of cut from the same cloth,
34120	37880	a part of the same era, which is probably why I made the knee-jerk connection.
37880	42560	The last time Seth Rogen went viral, it was over his public meltdown when his god-awful
42560	44780	show Santa Inc. was a failure.
44780	48440	So when I saw Jonah Hill go viral, I was thinking that something similar had happened.
48440	52620	He had abandoned what made him famous, made some garbage woke show or movie, and was now
52620	54560	having a public hissy fit about it.
54560	57080	But nope, it was something else entirely.
57080	63280	Jonah Hill's ex-girlfriend posts his alleged texts, blasts him as a misogynist, oh boy,
63280	64280	here we go.
64280	68440	Jonah Hill's alleged dirty laundry is getting aired out by an ex, who's posting what she
68440	72140	claims are a ton of old texts from him, and painting him as a toxic partner.
72140	77160	Surf instructor Sarah Brady, his former flame of about a year from back in 2021, is dragging
77160	81220	the actor publicly on her Instagram account, and she's not holding anything back in her
81220	84960	repudiation of him as an alleged misogynist narcissist.
84960	88160	Though for those of you who don't know, I certainly didn't because I tend not to follow
88160	91160	celeb shit, Sarah Brady is a professional surfer.
91160	95120	Presumably they met through some LA contacts or something when she was there at the time.
95120	99480	She posted all of the proof of these claims as an Instagram story, which is very interesting,
99480	103960	because Instagram stories automatically delete themselves after 24 hours.
103960	106920	Thankfully everything was screencapped and uploaded elsewhere online.
106920	108640	Here's the one that kicked everything off.
108640	113880	In this text, Jonah is saying to Sarah, plain and simple, if you need surfing with men,
113880	117920	boundary-less, inappropriate friendships with men, to model, to post pictures of yourself
117920	122280	in a bathing suit, to post sexual pictures, friendships with women who are in unstable
122280	127120	places, and from your wild recent past, beyond getting a lunch or a coffee or something respectful,
127120	129060	I am not the right partner for you.
129060	133800	If these things bring you to a place of happiness, I support it, and there will be no hard feelings.
133800	136780	These are my boundaries for a romantic partnership.
136780	140600	Sarah added the caption, see the misuse of the term, boundaries.
140600	143720	Now here's the thing about boundaries in a relationship.
143720	146960	They are necessarily arbitrary and restrictive.
146960	149560	That makes them sound abusive, and they can be, but that's not a given.
149560	153440	A boundary is arbitrary because it's based entirely on what the people in the relationship
153440	155300	want, and it's going to be different for everybody.
155300	159080	What cheating looks like in a monogamous relationship is going to look a lot different than what
159080	161240	cheating looks like in an open relationship.
161240	164800	One couple might be fine with casual drinking, but another couple might have somebody who's
164800	168600	a recovering alcoholic or something, and maintains a strict rule that there's no drinking in
168600	172360	the house, or you can't hang out with old drinking friends or something like that.
172360	175520	Boundaries have to be arbitrary because people aren't all the same.
175520	179440	A boundary is restrictive because, well, that's literally the point of it.
179440	183160	It's drawing lines around behaviors that you don't want your partner to engage in.
183160	187240	In a monogamous relationship, you don't want your partner fucking people behind your back.
187240	189800	You are necessarily restricting them from that behavior.
189800	193360	Now, just because violating a boundary that you've agreed to in a relationship isn't a
193360	197100	moral act, this doesn't mean that your boundaries are moral in and of themselves.
197100	198100	Here's an example.
198100	201840	Let's say that you're deathly afraid of clowns, and you've set a hard boundary with your partner.
201840	202840	No clown stuff ever.
202840	203840	No jokes.
203840	204840	No pranks.
204840	205840	Or else you're done.
205840	208920	If your partner pulls a clown prank on you, the immorality doesn't stem from the clown.
208920	210280	The clown itself isn't immoral.
210280	212880	It's the fact that your partner violated your boundary.
212880	213880	That's immoral.
213880	216380	In essence, your boundaries are the conditions of your consent.
216380	219440	The relationship is intact only with the consent of both parties.
219440	222540	If a boundary is crossed, then the consent is violated.
222540	227080	This is because consent is fundamentally a deontological moral concept, based on rules,
227080	228080	not outcomes.
228080	229680	Something that I've talked about before.
229680	233560	So going back to Jonah Hill's boundaries, even if I personally think some of them are
233560	234560	a bit weird.
234560	237760	For example, I wouldn't demand of my partners not to post pics to social media of them in
237760	238760	bathing suits.
238760	240800	What matters is that he made them clear.
240800	244440	Sarah knew what they were, and as we'll see in a bit, she violated them anyway.
244440	245440	That's a two-way street.
245440	249040	She can also have boundaries that he must agree to in order for him to date her too.
249040	250440	But that's not how she reacted.
250440	254000	Her narrative about this whole thing is that the boundaries themselves are abusive.
254000	255820	Well, let's see her evidence.
255820	257720	This is a warning plan to all girls.
257720	260560	If your partner is talking to you like this, make an exit plan.
260560	261560	Love y'all.
261560	264840	It's a bit hard to see, but Jonah is basically asking her to take down pictures of her surfing
264840	265840	in a bathing suit.
265840	267640	He's saying he's done with explaining himself.
267640	269240	She's asking what he wants pulled down.
269240	272040	He's saying the one with her ass out, and that there's tons of them going back months.
272040	275660	Again, it's not something that I would do, but this is pretty common for more conservative-oriented
275660	276660	people to want.
276660	279060	And he did communicate that it was a deal-breaker for him.
279060	283940	This is obviously not a case of abuse, but rather of them simply being mismatched partners.
283940	287860	If he doesn't like his girl being in public in a swimsuit and her thing is being a pro
287860	290640	surfer and posting it to Instagram, nobody's wrong here.
290640	291860	They're just incompatible.
291860	294500	You can make the argument that he should have known what he was getting into, but you can
294500	297620	also make the argument that she should have known what she was getting into as well.
297620	300860	Sarah then posts this message from her to her friend.
300860	305220	It's kind of unbelievable that a man who sent me shit like this, it's Jonah sending her
305220	309220	heart emojis over a pic of her in a swimsuit, would then be upset that I didn't read his
309220	313000	mind and take down pics of that once I was in a relationship with him.
313060	314980	You can read this sentence in two ways.
314980	318240	The first way is that Sarah simply wasn't told to take down the pics, hence why she
318240	320640	says that she didn't read his mind and take them down.
320640	323860	This makes Jonah sound unreasonable that he didn't communicate his boundaries to her
323860	325720	and that she would have had she known.
325720	330040	The second way to read it is that I didn't read his mind and I didn't take down the pics
330040	331600	are two separate actions.
331600	336120	That the mind-reading comment is used to deflect away from her not doing what he wants.
336120	339700	Reading it this way, it sounds like even if she knew that's what he wanted specifically,
339700	340700	she still wouldn't have done it.
340900	344180	Because it's not just the mind-reading that's objectionable, it's the taking down of the
344180	345180	pics itself.
345180	348800	There's not enough context here to truly know what she means, but of course, she paints
348800	350540	Jonah in the worst possible light.
350540	352300	And then there's this exchange.
352300	353300	Jonah sent her this long text.
353300	354300	You're right.
354300	358540	We can't do surf social things or develop trust until you consider me and make decisions
358540	360260	that give regard to our relationship.
360260	363740	I've been as vulnerable as possible and I'm telling you I'm needing you to step up to
363740	365780	the plate, which you can, I'm sure of it.
365780	368500	But these losers don't get your time if you want me.
368500	369740	Straight up, it's consideration.
369740	373900	I respect your love of surfing, but I respect myself as well, and your love of surfing and
373900	377720	being in those situations and lack of awareness are not mutually exclusive.
377720	378720	This isn't me.
378720	380020	I have my own issues that I own.
380020	383540	If you want marriage and family, you can't use the 25 card.
383540	384760	Step up and cut shit.
384760	388500	These people don't get your time or your kindness at the sacrifice of minds.
388500	391500	She's actually cut off Jonah's messages in every single screencap, which is kind of fishy
391500	394360	in and of itself, but she adds another of her own captions here.
394360	399080	By these people, he meant any friends of mine that he hadn't personally approved of.
399080	402760	Jonah's clearly trying to paint him as this abuser who's keeping her away from her friends.
402760	403760	But read it again.
403760	406020	He's not saying don't you dare talk to them anymore.
406020	409100	He's saying these losers don't get your time if you want me.
409100	411960	The option to walk away and keep her friends is right there on the table.
411960	415160	We again don't have the full context, but it's entirely possible that Jonah has a good
415160	418320	reason for not wanting these people in his life and it's his right to walk away from
418320	419320	them.
419320	422040	In this case, this is him extending a hand to her and seeing if she wants to walk with
422040	423040	him.
423040	426120	That 25 card comment also sounds a bit odd in a context.
426160	429280	At this point, I think she was 25 years old and he was 37.
429280	433440	The age gap and the experience gap and the wealth gap are all power imbalances in their
433440	438080	relationship and my intuition tells me that it's possible in previous arguments she leaned
438080	442320	on her age to explain some part of her behavior or her lifestyle or something, which might
442320	444400	be what he's calling the 25 card.
444400	445400	We just don't know.
445400	449520	This is why I try not to prejudge a relationship based on a viral story or a clip, like for
449520	452020	example that Steven Crowder thing from a few months ago.
452020	455560	You can't get the full deep knowledge of a romantic partnership watching a couple of
455560	456960	curated clips.
456960	461080	And of course there's a bunch of weird me too women on the internet who are blindly
461080	464860	coming to our defense and talking about how scary it is that men don't see a problem with
464860	466840	putting boundaries up in relationships.
466840	468400	Like check this chick out.
468400	472360	If you would have told me yesterday I would wake up today upset with Jonah Hill, I would
472360	473360	have called you a liar.
473360	477200	How are you going to tell a surfer to stop surfing when she was already surfing when
477200	478200	you met her?
478200	479200	That's what kills me.
479200	481800	It's like you knew who you were, right?
481800	482960	Like you knew who?
483000	488640	I don't know why people want a bad bitch and then they get one and they want her to be
488640	489640	Amish.
489640	494640	No disrespect to the Amish, but perhaps me and Sarah, I'm putting myself in there.
494640	495640	Bad bitchery.
495640	497680	Me and Sarah are not partial to the Victorian bonnet.
497680	498680	You know what I'm talking about?
498680	504860	The weaponizing of therapy talk is crazy because you're learning terminology you use in therapy
504860	508200	to get someone to stop doing what they love.
508200	509840	That's crazy.
509840	510840	That's crazy.
510840	515560	Also, those are not boundaries, those are not boundaries.
515560	517600	Like I'm so glad you're in therapy.
517600	522520	Man, it's actually entirely reasonable to expect that a person's behaviors change in
522520	525500	between being in a relationship and being single.
525500	528580	If you're sleeping around when you're single, do you think you should just continue to sleep
528580	529580	around once you're taken?
529580	532320	Like, nah, I'm not going to change for no man, I'm a strong independent woman.
532320	534480	Yeah, you can be fucking independent all right.
534480	538720	After this story went viral, Jonah messaged Sarah to basically say, not cool, dude.
538720	541200	But even here, he's actually not saying anything wrong.
541200	543420	He's not blowing up, he's not throwing anything in her face.
543420	545420	He's saying he's hurt, he's disappointed.
545420	549720	He's sorry that it hurts her that he's moving on, but he's actually innocent of any wrongdoing.
549720	553280	In fact, this entire time, everything that I've seen from him has been reasonable.
553280	556900	He set his boundaries, he's enforced his boundaries, and he's moved on when she wasn't the right
556900	557900	one for him.
557900	561380	And she's coming out of the woodwork two years later, seemingly because she's just bitter
561380	562380	about it all.
562380	564940	And I do think it's just bitterness, by the way.
564940	569640	Even though Sarah Brady's social media presence has increased tenfold due to this event, Jonah
569640	572520	Hill hasn't been canceled or metooed or anything.
572520	576280	Once the story failed to gain the traction that she wanted, Sarah began to make social
576280	580840	media posts like Boycott Stutz, Stutz is a new Netflix documentary that Jonah's a part
580840	585920	of, or vague posts like this, where she says, when I choose both revenge and healing.
585920	589820	A couple of days ago, she even posted this update, proclaiming that she got Jonah banned
589820	591540	from Hawaiian beaches.
591540	594080	Since the breakup, she had moved to Hawaii to further her surfing career.
594220	596020	Oh, here's a fun bit of trivia.
596020	599860	Also a couple of days ago, Sarah Brady dropped another set of embarrassing DMs, but this
599860	602460	time about a different ex-boyfriend.
602460	603460	Jackson Hinkle.
603460	606820	Yes, the pro-Russia mega-communist dipshit.
606820	608300	That Jackson Hinkle.
608300	612180	Apparently he was a full-on socialist on the left back in 2020, but the relationship between
612180	616940	Hinkle and Sarah apparently left her with PTSD, which she confirmed in long reams of
616940	619340	texts, making fun of him to her friends.
619340	624680	It's so weird that we live in a world where Jackson Hinkle and Jonah Hill are Eskimo brothers.
624680	627920	It's pretty clear at this point that Sarah is just a clout-chaser who's dropping DMs
627920	630240	and tearing others down in order to pull herself up.
630240	634180	But because this is how canceling works, once somebody's on the ropes, you pile on.
634180	639240	A few days after this story went viral, Zoey 101 star Alexa Nicholas accused Jonah Hill
639240	643440	of forcing himself on her when she was 16 and he was 24.
643440	645040	That's 15 years ago, guys.
645040	646280	Back in 2008.
646280	648960	Why the fuck did you wait this long to talk about it if it actually happened?
649580	650580	Are you maximizing clout?
650580	651900	Or maybe you're just making it up?
651900	653940	All right, let's read her story.
653940	658260	After reading Sarah Brady's admirable post about Jonah Hill, I just got a say.
658260	662260	When I was 16, I got invited to a house party at Justin Long's house where he was living
662260	665340	with some lame predator actor from CSI Miami.
665340	668660	Jonah seemed to have his eyes on me because at one point I wanted a cigarette and he said
668660	670340	he had one in his car right outside.
670340	672340	Didn't seem like too much of an effort, so I trusted him.
672340	674920	I went outside and he grabbed the cigs from his front seat.
674920	678420	Jonah Hill, notice how she's hashtagging each post, didn't hand me the cig, which
678440	679560	I thought was weird.
679560	683080	And then as we walked back to the door, I asked him for it and he said nothing, but
683080	685600	slammed me to the door and shoved his tongue down my throat.
685600	686600	I was so appalled.
686600	688200	I pushed him off and ran inside.
688200	692340	Dude, this is the most that happened story I've ever heard in my entire life.
692340	696560	This chick, Alexa Nicholas, she's also got a history of just accusing people of shit
696560	697560	like this.
697560	699280	Listen to her appearance on this podcast.
699280	700400	You're 16 years old.
700400	703120	You message Mike because you don't see he has like any tour dates and you're like, I
703120	704120	would like to see this guy.
704120	705120	He's got great music.
705120	708460	I get a response like quickly back and like, what's his response?
708460	709460	It's friendly and everything.
709460	712620	As for my phone number right away, right away.
712620	713940	And at this point you're like 16.
713940	715380	How do you know how old he was like?
715380	716380	He was 33.
716380	718100	Oh my God.
718100	720020	He's three years older than I am now.
720020	722420	I'm still not even the age that he was then.
722420	723420	Never.
723420	724420	Oh wow.
724420	725420	That is so.
725420	731460	Let me tell you at 30 right now, there is no way in hell that I would ever talk to a
731460	736800	16 year old unless it ends up being my daughter's friend and they're over for a play and like
736800	737800	there was no power.
737800	739720	There was no education around power dynamics yet.
739720	740720	Grooming.
740720	743520	I didn't even know what the fuck that was, which is horrible that I grew up in an era
743520	746200	where I didn't even know what grooming was.
746200	747200	So I didn't know.
747200	748540	I just thought, Oh, this is a guy.
748540	752860	He makes music that I like and super friendly, totally.
752860	754420	So I gave him my phone number.
754420	755800	He called me like five minutes later.
755800	756800	Dude.
756800	757800	All right.
757800	761440	This chick's apparently been stalked or groomed or whatever twice by the time she's 16.
761440	764220	She's apparently heading out to parties with booze and cigarettes.
764220	765220	Yeah.
765220	766660	She's legally still a kid at 16, but come the fuck on.
766660	767700	What were you doing there?
767700	770940	She was literally the bad kid that everyone tells you not to be and not to hang around.
770940	775080	Also, all of this stuff is coming out around the same time that she's announcing a new
775080	778500	show called Eat Predators, which is all about sexual predators.
778500	781820	The very topic she's going around talking about and trying to get attention on her for.
781820	783780	A show that nobody gives a shit about.
783780	786300	3000 subs, less than a thousand views each episode.
786300	787300	Okay.
787300	788300	Yeah.
788300	790700	She's literally just grifting and trying to get a spotlight on her shitty failed show.
790700	793420	I see no reason to pretend any of her stories are real.
793420	796640	I don't usually talk about celebrity nonsense on this channel because I generally don't
796640	797640	care.
797640	801260	But as always, as a deeper conversation here in the text, it's clear, in my opinion, anyway,
801260	805040	that Jonah is putting boundaries on Sarah's behavior that he deems appropriate.
805040	808720	Remember, she can do the same to him, but instead she's calling that abusive and dragging
808720	809720	him online for it.
809720	813200	Claiming he's a misogynist and a narcissist and worst of all, a conservative.
813200	817080	But also what's really noteworthy is that she accuses him of weaponizing therapy against
817080	818080	her.
819060	822380	And he was bringing up conversations and concepts from those sessions.
822380	826940	Now it's entirely possible to weaponize therapy, especially couples therapy, and it's insidious
826940	829180	because it has an air of authority around it.
829180	832780	The therapist said that you do X makes it sound like a therapist is on your side and
832780	834500	the other person is just the problem.
834500	837660	And any disagreement can be washed away in the flood of having an educated official back
837660	838660	up your claim.
838660	843040	One of the most effective ways to gaslight people is to do so with the apparent backing
843040	844800	of professional expertise.
844800	849380	But this also describes how Sarah's supporters came out and weaponized the therapeutic process
849380	850380	in the same way.
850380	851660	Like, listen to this soy boy.
851660	856980	Jonah Hill was using therapy speak to control his girlfriend Sarah, his now ex-girlfriend,
856980	861240	and it's important that we go over this misuse of therapy language, which is kind of a thing
861240	866860	these days, and how it can be super problematic as it masks controlling behavior under a commonly
866860	872400	accepted positive concept, in this case boundaries, making it harder for the person on the receiving
872400	874620	end, Sarah, to challenge it.
874620	879680	Okay, so Jonah is basically telling his professional surfer girlfriend, I am not going to be with
879680	885520	you if you surf with men, have boundaryless friendships with men, model, post pictures
885520	891240	in a bathing suit or post suggestive pictures and are friends with women who are in unstable
891240	892240	places.
892240	896480	He goes on to say that these are my boundaries for a romantic relationship.
896480	900360	He's straight up saying that Jonah is doing what Sarah did and what Sarah supporters are
900360	901360	doing, including him.
901360	903000	This is the Spiderman meme.
903060	907460	Jonah's use of the term boundaries in this message is a misuse of the concept.
907460	912820	A boundary is a healthy limit a person sets for themselves to protect their well-being
912820	913820	and integrity.
913820	918140	It is a rule or guideline that one creates to identify reasonable, safe, and permissible
918140	923620	ways for others to behave towards them and how they'll respond when someone passes those
923620	924620	limits.
924620	929580	However, in the message Jonah sent to Sarah, he is not setting boundaries that protect
929580	931100	his emotional well-being.
931200	936520	Instead, he is dictating what behaviors and friendships Sarah is permitted to have.
936520	942240	He's essentially instructing Sarah on who she can be friends with, what she can do professionally,
942240	945080	and how she can show up online.
945080	947920	This is not an example of healthy boundary setting.
947920	950480	Instead, it reflects an attempt at control.
950480	954840	It demonstrates a lack of respect for Sarah's autonomy and individuality.
954840	960020	Jonah's message is more about restricting Sarah's behavior to suit his comfort levels
960020	964880	and insecurities rather than expressing his feelings or needs in a healthy manner.
964880	965880	Those are the same thing.
965880	969580	He's describing the exact same thing, he's just using more positive and more negative
969580	972440	language in the two examples because he's clearly biased.
972440	977000	Jonah has established reasonable, safe, and permissible ways for others to behave towards
977000	979800	him and how he'll respond when they pass those limits.
979800	984080	But that necessarily means restricting her behavior to suit his comfort level.
984080	987100	Like I said back at the start of the video, that's what a boundary is.
987100	988100	That is its purpose.
988440	992400	You don't get to unilaterally be in a relationship with somebody while violating all of their
992400	995600	boundaries and then cry foul when they break it off with you.
995600	999360	I have a lot to say about weaponizing expertise, specifically weaponizing therapy.
999360	1003140	I'm still getting through Dr. Thomas Saz's book on the topic, but this is like straight
1003140	1004840	out of the Modern Abusers Handbook.
1004840	1008720	To say that because you know more about a specialized field, like psychology for example,
1008720	1012680	your expertise should be deferred to, all the while misusing that trust.
1012680	1016920	The truth is, in my view, therapeutic terms and the weight that they carry should probably
1016920	1020060	not be taken out of the therapeutic setting, at least not commonly.
1020060	1023020	It's very easy to weaponize psych knowledge to attack somebody.
1023020	1026700	Like my psych textbook describes narcissism and you display these traits, so it's not
1026700	1029980	enough that I don't like you or that you are a bad boyfriend, but you're a narcissist.
1029980	1033260	You might be, who knows, but you're not making that declaration in good faith.
1033260	1036060	You're doing it because you're weaponizing your knowledge to fuck with somebody you're
1036060	1038540	mad at for moving on and leaving you behind.
1038540	1042740	It's common practice to just disbelieve me too stories at this point because, despite
1042740	1046520	the Weinstein's and the Epstein's of the world, a lot of them did turn out to be bullshit.
1046520	1050480	When you look at the Jonah Hill story, it is simply just a messy celeb breakup where
1050480	1052800	the girl is mad about it years later.
1052800	1056000	Even if Jonah did something wrong, it's only minor and certainly not worth trying
1056000	1057180	to blow up online.
1057180	1060960	But in my opinion, the greatest sign that one of these stories is actually just a bunch
1060960	1064380	of trumped-up garbage is that they weaponize therapeutic language.
1064380	1066080	That's the kicker here.
1066080	1069340	Somebody who weaponizes therapeutic language doesn't simply want a guy canceled.
1069340	1071980	They don't just want him slandered as an abuser.
1071980	1075640	They want to invoke the weight of an armchair diagnosis, like there's something deeply
1075640	1076960	wrong with him at his core.
1076960	1081060	He's not just a shitty ex, he's a narcissist or he's a sociopath, bringing in the added
1081060	1082880	condemnation of mental health stigma.
1082880	1087160	Which is wild to me, considering that lefties often try to destigmatize mental health problems.
1087160	1089480	At least in other scenarios where it benefits them to do so.
1089480	1093260	In any case, Jonah Hill didn't do anything wrong, and if he somehow loses jobs or money
1093260	1095960	for this shit show, he should probably sue her for defamation.
1095960	1099760	Just like how the leftoids have been taking other cultural L's recently, this shit is
1099760	1103080	unacceptable and we really gotta start slapping it down harder.
1103080	1106440	Alright guys, that about does it for me, thanks for watching the whole video if you're
1106440	1107440	here at the end.
1107440	1111480	I'm playing more Zelda again on stream tonight, so if you're watching this on release, come
1111480	1113240	by and say hi.
1113240	1114600	My girlfriend would be there too.
1114600	1116000	So I'll see you there.
1116000	1117440	Have a good one guys, I love you.
