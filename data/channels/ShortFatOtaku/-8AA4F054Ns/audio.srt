1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Jonah Hill

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,040
When I saw the search term Jonah Hill go viral on Twitter last week, for a minute there I

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,160
thought this was going to be like the whole Seth Rogen thing from a couple years ago.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,800
Yeah, do you remember that?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,080
In the wake of the 2020 election, Seth Rogen was running around DMing people on Twitter,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,240
asking them if they were Jewish, including Count Dankula.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,400
Now I gotta admit, I used to be big fans of both Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,800
I love those 2000s and 2010s comedies they both made.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,120
In my mind, and I'm sure in many others, they're kind of cut from the same cloth,

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,880
a part of the same era, which is probably why I made the knee-jerk connection.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,560
The last time Seth Rogen went viral, it was over his public meltdown when his god-awful

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,780
show Santa Inc. was a failure.

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,440
So when I saw Jonah Hill go viral, I was thinking that something similar had happened.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,620
He had abandoned what made him famous, made some garbage woke show or movie, and was now

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,560
having a public hissy fit about it.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,080
But nope, it was something else entirely.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,280
Jonah Hill's ex-girlfriend posts his alleged texts, blasts him as a misogynist, oh boy,

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
here we go.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,440
Jonah Hill's alleged dirty laundry is getting aired out by an ex, who's posting what she

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,140
claims are a ton of old texts from him, and painting him as a toxic partner.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,160
Surf instructor Sarah Brady, his former flame of about a year from back in 2021, is dragging

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,220
the actor publicly on her Instagram account, and she's not holding anything back in her

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,960
repudiation of him as an alleged misogynist narcissist.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,160
Though for those of you who don't know, I certainly didn't because I tend not to follow

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,160
celeb shit, Sarah Brady is a professional surfer.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,120
Presumably they met through some LA contacts or something when she was there at the time.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,480
She posted all of the proof of these claims as an Instagram story, which is very interesting,

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,960
because Instagram stories automatically delete themselves after 24 hours.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,920
Thankfully everything was screencapped and uploaded elsewhere online.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,640
Here's the one that kicked everything off.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,880
In this text, Jonah is saying to Sarah, plain and simple, if you need surfing with men,

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,920
boundary-less, inappropriate friendships with men, to model, to post pictures of yourself

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,280
in a bathing suit, to post sexual pictures, friendships with women who are in unstable

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,120
places, and from your wild recent past, beyond getting a lunch or a coffee or something respectful,

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,060
I am not the right partner for you.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,800
If these things bring you to a place of happiness, I support it, and there will be no hard feelings.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,780
These are my boundaries for a romantic partnership.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,600
Sarah added the caption, see the misuse of the term, boundaries.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,720
Now here's the thing about boundaries in a relationship.

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,960
They are necessarily arbitrary and restrictive.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,560
That makes them sound abusive, and they can be, but that's not a given.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,440
A boundary is arbitrary because it's based entirely on what the people in the relationship

43
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,300
want, and it's going to be different for everybody.

44
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,080
What cheating looks like in a monogamous relationship is going to look a lot different than what

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,240
cheating looks like in an open relationship.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,800
One couple might be fine with casual drinking, but another couple might have somebody who's

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,600
a recovering alcoholic or something, and maintains a strict rule that there's no drinking in

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,360
the house, or you can't hang out with old drinking friends or something like that.

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Boundaries have to be arbitrary because people aren't all the same.

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,440
A boundary is restrictive because, well, that's literally the point of it.

51
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,160
It's drawing lines around behaviors that you don't want your partner to engage in.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,240
In a monogamous relationship, you don't want your partner fucking people behind your back.

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,800
You are necessarily restricting them from that behavior.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,360
Now, just because violating a boundary that you've agreed to in a relationship isn't a

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,100
moral act, this doesn't mean that your boundaries are moral in and of themselves.

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Here's an example.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,840
Let's say that you're deathly afraid of clowns, and you've set a hard boundary with your partner.

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
No clown stuff ever.

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
No jokes.

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
No pranks.

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Or else you're done.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,920
If your partner pulls a clown prank on you, the immorality doesn't stem from the clown.

63
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,280
The clown itself isn't immoral.

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,880
It's the fact that your partner violated your boundary.

65
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
That's immoral.

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,380
In essence, your boundaries are the conditions of your consent.

67
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,440
The relationship is intact only with the consent of both parties.

68
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,540
If a boundary is crossed, then the consent is violated.

69
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,080
This is because consent is fundamentally a deontological moral concept, based on rules,

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
not outcomes.

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
Something that I've talked about before.

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,560
So going back to Jonah Hill's boundaries, even if I personally think some of them are

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
a bit weird.

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
For example, I wouldn't demand of my partners not to post pics to social media of them in

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
bathing suits.

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,800
What matters is that he made them clear.

77
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,440
Sarah knew what they were, and as we'll see in a bit, she violated them anyway.

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
That's a two-way street.

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,040
She can also have boundaries that he must agree to in order for him to date her too.

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,440
But that's not how she reacted.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,000
Her narrative about this whole thing is that the boundaries themselves are abusive.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,820
Well, let's see her evidence.

83
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,720
This is a warning plan to all girls.

84
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,560
If your partner is talking to you like this, make an exit plan.

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Love y'all.

86
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,840
It's a bit hard to see, but Jonah is basically asking her to take down pictures of her surfing

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
in a bathing suit.

88
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,640
He's saying he's done with explaining himself.

89
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,240
She's asking what he wants pulled down.

90
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,040
He's saying the one with her ass out, and that there's tons of them going back months.

91
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,660
Again, it's not something that I would do, but this is pretty common for more conservative-oriented

92
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
people to want.

93
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,060
And he did communicate that it was a deal-breaker for him.

94
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,940
This is obviously not a case of abuse, but rather of them simply being mismatched partners.

95
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,860
If he doesn't like his girl being in public in a swimsuit and her thing is being a pro

96
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,640
surfer and posting it to Instagram, nobody's wrong here.

97
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,860
They're just incompatible.

98
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,500
You can make the argument that he should have known what he was getting into, but you can

99
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,620
also make the argument that she should have known what she was getting into as well.

100
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,860
Sarah then posts this message from her to her friend.

101
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,220
It's kind of unbelievable that a man who sent me shit like this, it's Jonah sending her

102
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,220
heart emojis over a pic of her in a swimsuit, would then be upset that I didn't read his

103
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,000
mind and take down pics of that once I was in a relationship with him.

104
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,980
You can read this sentence in two ways.

105
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,240
The first way is that Sarah simply wasn't told to take down the pics, hence why she

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,640
says that she didn't read his mind and take them down.

107
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,860
This makes Jonah sound unreasonable that he didn't communicate his boundaries to her

108
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,720
and that she would have had she known.

109
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,040
The second way to read it is that I didn't read his mind and I didn't take down the pics

110
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,600
are two separate actions.

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,120
That the mind-reading comment is used to deflect away from her not doing what he wants.

112
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,700
Reading it this way, it sounds like even if she knew that's what he wanted specifically,

113
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
she still wouldn't have done it.

114
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,180
Because it's not just the mind-reading that's objectionable, it's the taking down of the

115
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
pics itself.

116
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,800
There's not enough context here to truly know what she means, but of course, she paints

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,540
Jonah in the worst possible light.

118
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,300
And then there's this exchange.

119
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Jonah sent her this long text.

120
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
You're right.

121
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,540
We can't do surf social things or develop trust until you consider me and make decisions

122
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,260
that give regard to our relationship.

123
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,740
I've been as vulnerable as possible and I'm telling you I'm needing you to step up to

124
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,780
the plate, which you can, I'm sure of it.

125
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,500
But these losers don't get your time if you want me.

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,740
Straight up, it's consideration.

127
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,900
I respect your love of surfing, but I respect myself as well, and your love of surfing and

128
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,720
being in those situations and lack of awareness are not mutually exclusive.

129
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
This isn't me.

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,020
I have my own issues that I own.

131
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,540
If you want marriage and family, you can't use the 25 card.

132
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,760
Step up and cut shit.

133
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,500
These people don't get your time or your kindness at the sacrifice of minds.

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
She's actually cut off Jonah's messages in every single screencap, which is kind of fishy

135
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,360
in and of itself, but she adds another of her own captions here.

136
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,080
By these people, he meant any friends of mine that he hadn't personally approved of.

137
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,760
Jonah's clearly trying to paint him as this abuser who's keeping her away from her friends.

138
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
But read it again.

139
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,020
He's not saying don't you dare talk to them anymore.

140
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,100
He's saying these losers don't get your time if you want me.

141
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,960
The option to walk away and keep her friends is right there on the table.

142
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,160
We again don't have the full context, but it's entirely possible that Jonah has a good

143
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,320
reason for not wanting these people in his life and it's his right to walk away from

144
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
them.

145
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,040
In this case, this is him extending a hand to her and seeing if she wants to walk with

146
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
him.

147
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,120
That 25 card comment also sounds a bit odd in a context.

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
At this point, I think she was 25 years old and he was 37.

149
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,440
The age gap and the experience gap and the wealth gap are all power imbalances in their

150
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,080
relationship and my intuition tells me that it's possible in previous arguments she leaned

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,320
on her age to explain some part of her behavior or her lifestyle or something, which might

152
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,400
be what he's calling the 25 card.

153
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
We just don't know.

154
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,520
This is why I try not to prejudge a relationship based on a viral story or a clip, like for

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,020
example that Steven Crowder thing from a few months ago.

156
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,560
You can't get the full deep knowledge of a romantic partnership watching a couple of

157
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,960
curated clips.

158
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,080
And of course there's a bunch of weird me too women on the internet who are blindly

159
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,860
coming to our defense and talking about how scary it is that men don't see a problem with

160
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,840
putting boundaries up in relationships.

161
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
Like check this chick out.

162
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,360
If you would have told me yesterday I would wake up today upset with Jonah Hill, I would

163
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
have called you a liar.

164
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,200
How are you going to tell a surfer to stop surfing when she was already surfing when

165
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
you met her?

166
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
That's what kills me.

167
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,800
It's like you knew who you were, right?

168
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,960
Like you knew who?

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,640
I don't know why people want a bad bitch and then they get one and they want her to be

170
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Amish.

171
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,640
No disrespect to the Amish, but perhaps me and Sarah, I'm putting myself in there.

172
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Bad bitchery.

173
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,680
Me and Sarah are not partial to the Victorian bonnet.

174
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
You know what I'm talking about?

175
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,860
The weaponizing of therapy talk is crazy because you're learning terminology you use in therapy

176
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,200
to get someone to stop doing what they love.

177
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,840
That's crazy.

178
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
That's crazy.

179
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,560
Also, those are not boundaries, those are not boundaries.

180
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,600
Like I'm so glad you're in therapy.

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,520
Man, it's actually entirely reasonable to expect that a person's behaviors change in

182
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,500
between being in a relationship and being single.

183
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,580
If you're sleeping around when you're single, do you think you should just continue to sleep

184
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
around once you're taken?

185
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,320
Like, nah, I'm not going to change for no man, I'm a strong independent woman.

186
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
Yeah, you can be fucking independent all right.

187
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,720
After this story went viral, Jonah messaged Sarah to basically say, not cool, dude.

188
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
But even here, he's actually not saying anything wrong.

189
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,420
He's not blowing up, he's not throwing anything in her face.

190
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
He's saying he's hurt, he's disappointed.

191
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,720
He's sorry that it hurts her that he's moving on, but he's actually innocent of any wrongdoing.

192
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,280
In fact, this entire time, everything that I've seen from him has been reasonable.

193
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,900
He set his boundaries, he's enforced his boundaries, and he's moved on when she wasn't the right

194
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
one for him.

195
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,380
And she's coming out of the woodwork two years later, seemingly because she's just bitter

196
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,380
about it all.

197
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,940
And I do think it's just bitterness, by the way.

198
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,640
Even though Sarah Brady's social media presence has increased tenfold due to this event, Jonah

199
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,520
Hill hasn't been canceled or metooed or anything.

200
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,280
Once the story failed to gain the traction that she wanted, Sarah began to make social

201
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,840
media posts like Boycott Stutz, Stutz is a new Netflix documentary that Jonah's a part

202
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,920
of, or vague posts like this, where she says, when I choose both revenge and healing.

203
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,820
A couple of days ago, she even posted this update, proclaiming that she got Jonah banned

204
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,540
from Hawaiian beaches.

205
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,080
Since the breakup, she had moved to Hawaii to further her surfing career.

206
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,020
Oh, here's a fun bit of trivia.

207
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,860
Also a couple of days ago, Sarah Brady dropped another set of embarrassing DMs, but this

208
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,460
time about a different ex-boyfriend.

209
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Jackson Hinkle.

210
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,820
Yes, the pro-Russia mega-communist dipshit.

211
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,300
That Jackson Hinkle.

212
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,180
Apparently he was a full-on socialist on the left back in 2020, but the relationship between

213
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,940
Hinkle and Sarah apparently left her with PTSD, which she confirmed in long reams of

214
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,340
texts, making fun of him to her friends.

215
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,680
It's so weird that we live in a world where Jackson Hinkle and Jonah Hill are Eskimo brothers.

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,920
It's pretty clear at this point that Sarah is just a clout-chaser who's dropping DMs

217
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,240
and tearing others down in order to pull herself up.

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,180
But because this is how canceling works, once somebody's on the ropes, you pile on.

219
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,240
A few days after this story went viral, Zoey 101 star Alexa Nicholas accused Jonah Hill

220
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,440
of forcing himself on her when she was 16 and he was 24.

221
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
That's 15 years ago, guys.

222
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,280
Back in 2008.

223
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,960
Why the fuck did you wait this long to talk about it if it actually happened?

224
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Are you maximizing clout?

225
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,900
Or maybe you're just making it up?

226
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,940
All right, let's read her story.

227
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,260
After reading Sarah Brady's admirable post about Jonah Hill, I just got a say.

228
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,260
When I was 16, I got invited to a house party at Justin Long's house where he was living

229
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,340
with some lame predator actor from CSI Miami.

230
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,660
Jonah seemed to have his eyes on me because at one point I wanted a cigarette and he said

231
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,340
he had one in his car right outside.

232
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Didn't seem like too much of an effort, so I trusted him.

233
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,920
I went outside and he grabbed the cigs from his front seat.

234
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,420
Jonah Hill, notice how she's hashtagging each post, didn't hand me the cig, which

235
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,560
I thought was weird.

236
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,080
And then as we walked back to the door, I asked him for it and he said nothing, but

237
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,600
slammed me to the door and shoved his tongue down my throat.

238
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I was so appalled.

239
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,200
I pushed him off and ran inside.

240
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,340
Dude, this is the most that happened story I've ever heard in my entire life.

241
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,560
This chick, Alexa Nicholas, she's also got a history of just accusing people of shit

242
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
like this.

243
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,280
Listen to her appearance on this podcast.

244
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,400
You're 16 years old.

245
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,120
You message Mike because you don't see he has like any tour dates and you're like, I

246
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
would like to see this guy.

247
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
He's got great music.

248
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,460
I get a response like quickly back and like, what's his response?

249
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
It's friendly and everything.

250
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,620
As for my phone number right away, right away.

251
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,940
And at this point you're like 16.

252
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,380
How do you know how old he was like?

253
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
He was 33.

254
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,100
Oh my God.

255
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,020
He's three years older than I am now.

256
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm still not even the age that he was then.

257
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Never.

258
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
Oh wow.

259
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
That is so.

260
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,460
Let me tell you at 30 right now, there is no way in hell that I would ever talk to a

261
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,800
16 year old unless it ends up being my daughter's friend and they're over for a play and like

262
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
there was no power.

263
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,720
There was no education around power dynamics yet.

264
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Grooming.

265
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,520
I didn't even know what the fuck that was, which is horrible that I grew up in an era

266
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,200
where I didn't even know what grooming was.

267
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
So I didn't know.

268
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,540
I just thought, Oh, this is a guy.

269
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,860
He makes music that I like and super friendly, totally.

270
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,420
So I gave him my phone number.

271
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,800
He called me like five minutes later.

272
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Dude.

273
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
All right.

274
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,440
This chick's apparently been stalked or groomed or whatever twice by the time she's 16.

275
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,220
She's apparently heading out to parties with booze and cigarettes.

276
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
Yeah.

277
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,660
She's legally still a kid at 16, but come the fuck on.

278
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,700
What were you doing there?

279
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,940
She was literally the bad kid that everyone tells you not to be and not to hang around.

280
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,080
Also, all of this stuff is coming out around the same time that she's announcing a new

281
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,500
show called Eat Predators, which is all about sexual predators.

282
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,820
The very topic she's going around talking about and trying to get attention on her for.

283
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,780
A show that nobody gives a shit about.

284
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,300
3000 subs, less than a thousand views each episode.

285
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Okay.

286
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Yeah.

287
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,700
She's literally just grifting and trying to get a spotlight on her shitty failed show.

288
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,420
I see no reason to pretend any of her stories are real.

289
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,640
I don't usually talk about celebrity nonsense on this channel because I generally don't

290
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
care.

291
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,260
But as always, as a deeper conversation here in the text, it's clear, in my opinion, anyway,

292
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,040
that Jonah is putting boundaries on Sarah's behavior that he deems appropriate.

293
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,720
Remember, she can do the same to him, but instead she's calling that abusive and dragging

294
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
him online for it.

295
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,200
Claiming he's a misogynist and a narcissist and worst of all, a conservative.

296
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,080
But also what's really noteworthy is that she accuses him of weaponizing therapy against

297
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
her.

298
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,380
And he was bringing up conversations and concepts from those sessions.

299
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,940
Now it's entirely possible to weaponize therapy, especially couples therapy, and it's insidious

300
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,180
because it has an air of authority around it.

301
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,780
The therapist said that you do X makes it sound like a therapist is on your side and

302
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,500
the other person is just the problem.

303
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,660
And any disagreement can be washed away in the flood of having an educated official back

304
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
up your claim.

305
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,040
One of the most effective ways to gaslight people is to do so with the apparent backing

306
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,800
of professional expertise.

307
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,380
But this also describes how Sarah's supporters came out and weaponized the therapeutic process

308
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
in the same way.

309
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,660
Like, listen to this soy boy.

310
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,980
Jonah Hill was using therapy speak to control his girlfriend Sarah, his now ex-girlfriend,

311
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,240
and it's important that we go over this misuse of therapy language, which is kind of a thing

312
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,860
these days, and how it can be super problematic as it masks controlling behavior under a commonly

313
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,400
accepted positive concept, in this case boundaries, making it harder for the person on the receiving

314
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,620
end, Sarah, to challenge it.

315
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,680
Okay, so Jonah is basically telling his professional surfer girlfriend, I am not going to be with

316
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,520
you if you surf with men, have boundaryless friendships with men, model, post pictures

317
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,240
in a bathing suit or post suggestive pictures and are friends with women who are in unstable

318
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
places.

319
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,480
He goes on to say that these are my boundaries for a romantic relationship.

320
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,360
He's straight up saying that Jonah is doing what Sarah did and what Sarah supporters are

321
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
doing, including him.

322
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,000
This is the Spiderman meme.

323
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,460
Jonah's use of the term boundaries in this message is a misuse of the concept.

324
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,820
A boundary is a healthy limit a person sets for themselves to protect their well-being

325
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,820
and integrity.

326
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,140
It is a rule or guideline that one creates to identify reasonable, safe, and permissible

327
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,620
ways for others to behave towards them and how they'll respond when someone passes those

328
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
limits.

329
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,580
However, in the message Jonah sent to Sarah, he is not setting boundaries that protect

330
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,100
his emotional well-being.

331
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,520
Instead, he is dictating what behaviors and friendships Sarah is permitted to have.

332
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,240
He's essentially instructing Sarah on who she can be friends with, what she can do professionally,

333
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,080
and how she can show up online.

334
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,920
This is not an example of healthy boundary setting.

335
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,480
Instead, it reflects an attempt at control.

336
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,840
It demonstrates a lack of respect for Sarah's autonomy and individuality.

337
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,020
Jonah's message is more about restricting Sarah's behavior to suit his comfort levels

338
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,880
and insecurities rather than expressing his feelings or needs in a healthy manner.

339
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Those are the same thing.

340
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,580
He's describing the exact same thing, he's just using more positive and more negative

341
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,440
language in the two examples because he's clearly biased.

342
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,000
Jonah has established reasonable, safe, and permissible ways for others to behave towards

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,800
him and how he'll respond when they pass those limits.

344
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,080
But that necessarily means restricting her behavior to suit his comfort level.

345
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,100
Like I said back at the start of the video, that's what a boundary is.

346
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
That is its purpose.

347
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,400
You don't get to unilaterally be in a relationship with somebody while violating all of their

348
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,600
boundaries and then cry foul when they break it off with you.

349
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,360
I have a lot to say about weaponizing expertise, specifically weaponizing therapy.

350
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,140
I'm still getting through Dr. Thomas Saz's book on the topic, but this is like straight

351
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,840
out of the Modern Abusers Handbook.

352
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,720
To say that because you know more about a specialized field, like psychology for example,

353
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,680
your expertise should be deferred to, all the while misusing that trust.

354
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,920
The truth is, in my view, therapeutic terms and the weight that they carry should probably

355
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,060
not be taken out of the therapeutic setting, at least not commonly.

356
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,020
It's very easy to weaponize psych knowledge to attack somebody.

357
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,700
Like my psych textbook describes narcissism and you display these traits, so it's not

358
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,980
enough that I don't like you or that you are a bad boyfriend, but you're a narcissist.

359
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,260
You might be, who knows, but you're not making that declaration in good faith.

360
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,060
You're doing it because you're weaponizing your knowledge to fuck with somebody you're

361
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,540
mad at for moving on and leaving you behind.

362
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,740
It's common practice to just disbelieve me too stories at this point because, despite

363
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,520
the Weinstein's and the Epstein's of the world, a lot of them did turn out to be bullshit.

364
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,480
When you look at the Jonah Hill story, it is simply just a messy celeb breakup where

365
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,800
the girl is mad about it years later.

366
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,000
Even if Jonah did something wrong, it's only minor and certainly not worth trying

367
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,180
to blow up online.

368
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,960
But in my opinion, the greatest sign that one of these stories is actually just a bunch

369
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,380
of trumped-up garbage is that they weaponize therapeutic language.

370
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,080
That's the kicker here.

371
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,340
Somebody who weaponizes therapeutic language doesn't simply want a guy canceled.

372
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,980
They don't just want him slandered as an abuser.

373
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,640
They want to invoke the weight of an armchair diagnosis, like there's something deeply

374
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,960
wrong with him at his core.

375
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,060
He's not just a shitty ex, he's a narcissist or he's a sociopath, bringing in the added

376
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,880
condemnation of mental health stigma.

377
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,160
Which is wild to me, considering that lefties often try to destigmatize mental health problems.

378
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,480
At least in other scenarios where it benefits them to do so.

379
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,260
In any case, Jonah Hill didn't do anything wrong, and if he somehow loses jobs or money

380
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,960
for this shit show, he should probably sue her for defamation.

381
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,760
Just like how the leftoids have been taking other cultural L's recently, this shit is

382
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,080
unacceptable and we really gotta start slapping it down harder.

383
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,440
Alright guys, that about does it for me, thanks for watching the whole video if you're

384
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
here at the end.

385
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm playing more Zelda again on stream tonight, so if you're watching this on release, come

386
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,240
by and say hi.

387
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
My girlfriend would be there too.

388
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
So I'll see you there.

389
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
Have a good one guys, I love you.
