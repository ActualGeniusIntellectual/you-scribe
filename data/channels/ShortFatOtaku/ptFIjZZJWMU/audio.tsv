0	5820	Hello everyone, welcome to TikTok Tuesday on Monday night, the main reason for this is I'm still working on that giant video
5820	10700	I don't know if you pay attention to my Twitter or my discord or the community posts on the YouTube channel
10700	15260	But I announced I think was it Friday. I announced Friday or Saturday. I was making a huge video
15260	18120	I figured I have it up by Saturday. That's why no video come out on Saturday, by the way
18120	22160	I had planned for it to come out then. Well, I didn't finish it in time
22160	24620	So I worked all through Saturday aside from the weekly sip
24620	28040	I worked all through Sunday and then I said, you know, I'll get it on Monday. Sure
28040	32960	Oh, I didn't get it on Monday. I'm nearly done though. I'm nearly done. I'll be able to get it out
33600	39560	Tuesday morning, so you know what Tuesday morning drop by it's gonna be one of those really big videos like the three forms of fascism
39560	44360	Or like the Antonio Gramsci video very long at least an hour long. I'm gonna be premiering it. It's gonna be great
44360	46420	Make sure you drop in make sure your super chat
46420	48260	I definitely need the money right now
48260	53120	Some IRL things happen that I talked about on the weekly sip the TLDR is that my car is fucked
53120	55880	I gotta get a new car. That's as simple as that. Anyway enough of that nonsense
56160	62160	We are here check out this week's round of tick-tock gobbledygook, let's go
62360	69280	This comment is asking if I could prove that all 2,000 of the billionaires are evil people. Yeah. Yeah, I can
69280	74520	Oh my god, I can already tell this is gonna be cancerous. All right, Tormund Giantsbane. Tell me all about it
74520	77560	So first let's put a billion into perspective
78320	81400	1 million seconds is about 12 days
81880	85160	1 billion seconds is just under 32 years
85840	92960	Which means that if you earned one dollar every single set number big and never number bigger any of it
92960	99400	It would take you about 32 years to earn a single billion dollars if you earned
100660	105680	$5,000 a day from the time that Columbus started his infamous voyage. It would take you about
106520	112320	527 years to earn a single billion dollars and there are people out there with
112920	117800	Multiple billions of dollars. Holy shit. I was just joking. His argument actually is a big number is bigger
118080	123480	Listen, I don't know if you value your time or your labor at one dollar a day
123480	129200	I don't know if that's your your personal level of worth, but basically I'm sure he's gonna get into it
129200	131080	He's gonna get into some sort of labor theory of value
131080	132940	I'm sure that's where we can be the next leg of the tick-tock
132980	138420	The reason some people make more money is because their labor is more valuable to more people
138420	140740	How hard you work can actually affect certain things for sure
140740	146660	But ultimately it's how valuable your labor is based on that math. We can conclude that there's no ethical way to
147380	151620	Billion really because there is no physically possible way to earn that money
151860	159340	Solely through the value of your own labor actually very very very dumb because not all labor is created equal
159340	163780	A guy digging a hole with a shovel is gonna get a whole lot less
164180	170020	Digging done with a whole lot more of his own energy expended than a guy digging a hole with a backhoe
170020	174780	It's not equal and it shouldn't be equal which means that in order to become a billionaire
174780	178500	You have to steal the labor value of thousands
178500	183740	If not millions of people and we know that this is the case and we know that this is the case because between
184220	191580	1979 oh god this statistic one the average productivity meaning the average amount of labor value produced by the workers has increased by
192380	193620	64.6%
193620	200980	Meanwhile, the average wage of workers has only increased by about seventeen point three percent. That's it. Okay, you want to know why?
201420	207160	Okay, hold on. Yeah, that's difference of nearly fifteen labor value right difference of nearly fifty percent labor value
207160	209600	Got it. You want to know why this is the case?
210040	214480	It's because productivity and value aren't the same thing
215080	222120	Laborers become more productive once they have let's say better education or better tools. There's a whole bunch of different factors here
222120	224120	It's not just that owners are
224400	230240	scraping surplus value off the backs of the laborers people at the very top of businesses still do labor in them and the fact that
230240	235680	Their labor affects the entire business and therefore all the all the people who shop at that business
235760	241000	Use that business a service that's what makes their labor more valuable because they affect more people
241000	242920	I've outlined this in several videos. I'll just do it again real quick
242920	245960	Let's say they work at a grocery store, right? So you put up a hundred boxes in an hour
245960	246440	Okay
246440	249040	During that hour of work your labor has affected
249160	255600	100 potential customers right at some point hundred customers will come by and buy those hundred boxes and so your labor affects a hundred other
255600	257720	People that's what gives it its value now
257720	264260	Let's say you have a guy who's a receiver and he's taking the product off the delivery truck and putting it in the back room
264260	269700	He's gonna be using a tool generally a hand jack or a power jack and he's gonna be moving pallets and he can move pallets
269700	273500	Way faster with his tool than you can moving individual boxes with your hands
273500	279220	He might move a thousand boxes from the truck the back room in the same hour that you move a hundred boxes
279340	281980	From the back room to the store floor his labor
282140	288260	Even though it's the same amount of time and also probably less labor intensive for him personally his labor affects
288700	291140	1,000 customers instead of a hundred so he makes more money
291140	297100	Then you have the store manager whose labor affects every customer in the store the district manager who affects the customers of every single
297260	302540	Person who shops at any store in the district all the way up the chain your labor affects more people you get paid more
302540	304540	For it. It's as simple as that already
304700	310300	Billionaires are stealing 50% or more of their workers labor value so that can sit around in
310620	314980	investment funds and stock portfolios providing nothing of value to society
315380	319620	Does even know what a stock portfolio is like an investment? Do you even know what these things are?
319660	324420	Okay, when you buy stock what you're doing is you're buying a portion of a company. All right, so there's a company
324420	327260	It's going for sale. You can buy stock in the company
327260	332300	So you own like ten you pay the company X amount of dollars you own like five stocks and like five percent of the company
332300	337740	Or something, right? The reason companies go public is because they need money for expansion
337740	337900	You know
337900	343180	The company is booming so you have a shop right and it's booming and you use it's time for you to like branch out buy
343180	345820	Other locations open other shops, you know grow the business
346180	350300	You can take a loan out but loans have interest on them or you could go public and
350780	358020	Sell part ownership of your company and then use that capital that you gain from selling the ownership to expand the business
358020	362540	So when money is sitting in a stock portfolio, you know what it's actually doing
362540	369100	It's enabling businesses to expand which allows them to hire more people and provide more services to the community
369100	374900	So it's not doing nothing sitting in a stock portfolio you fucking moron. There are currently over
375340	380980	582 thousand homeless people in the United States many of which are children. Hold on
381620	383620	582 thousand homeless people
385580	387580	Population of the USA
387940	390060	331.9 million. Okay. Okay, so it's
391660	397460	0.0015 percent of the country is homeless, you know, that's pretty good
399020	404820	The reason there's a lot of homeless people in America is because there's a lot of fucking people in America and in the year 2020
404820	409300	There were more than 34 million food insecure people in the United States
409300	410300	that's about
410300	417100	10% of the population that doesn't know where their next meal is going to come from the condition of not having access to sufficient food
417100	422220	Or food of an adequate quality to meet one's basic needs. Okay, like
423180	426500	Sufficient food means you don't have enough food. You're just going poor you have no food
426500	430180	You're hungry but food of an adequate quality that could just mean that they're eating shit
430900	435780	Because I don't know if you've noticed but poor people in the United States and in the Western world in general
435780	440060	They're not skinny. They're not starving. They're fat. All right, they're eating way too many carbs
440180	444140	That's a problem that we have to solve but it's not the same thing as just starving people everywhere
444140	450100	You know food insecurity is not the same thing as hunger and I think that's why this guy's not saying hunger
450100	455380	Now, do you know how much it would cost to end homelessness in the United States according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development?
455380	460620	It would cost 20 billion dollars to end homelessness in the United States a lot of that money
460620	467200	They have actually isn't cash its assets and if everyone sells their assets to get liquid cash one
467200	472620	They won't get as much liquid cash as they think and two there's no buyers for assets that expensive
472620	478700	Also, I'm gonna have to rely on the old-school d-boonkers, but apparently that 20 billion dollar figure
478700	483860	It's actually not that accurate would likely cost significantly more than 20 billion to house America's homeless population
484020	488760	After factoring in the expansion of the federal housing voucher program and affordable housing development
488940	494980	Yeah, it ain't just 20 billion dude. It's a lot more. Of course his answers just take more from the billionaires
494980	498500	But I mean as I said, there's no liquid cash there. It's all assets
498620	503560	This guy just doesn't understand what he's talking about. He doesn't understand economics doesn't understand finance
503560	505900	He doesn't understand why things are the way they are
505900	511900	He sees one little slice of society and thinks oh it needs to be this way because he has no actual information
511900	518460	Maybe this is why Hollywood's replacing all these redheads with black people because they're actually stupid. Okay. Now that's maybe that's a little too far
518460	520460	Sorry, sorry, my redheaded listeners
537140	539140	This has to be a troll
539140	541140	I
541380	543380	Okay, this is a troll this is a troll
547880	553700	Wow, okay. Okay. I thought maybe that was like like the cops weren't in on it initially still pretty funny though
558260	562060	Then don't post it I've had to record this for context don't do it
562060	568260	Then mom ripped up my kinky drawings called me disgusting and gave me a lifelong guilt complex for having a pregnancy finish
570140	572280	Well summer you wanted to see my drawing
574700	576700	Why
577620	579620	Here's one I did in high school
580220	585780	So guilty hated myself afterwards. Jesus Christ. You should paper you should feel guilty
585780	592180	And though I perceive myself as being completely unable to draw so more often than not I get all missions like this
