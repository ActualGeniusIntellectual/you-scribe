00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
Hello everyone, welcome to TikTok Tuesday on Monday night, the main reason for this is I'm still working on that giant video

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,700
I don't know if you pay attention to my Twitter or my discord or the community posts on the YouTube channel

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,260
But I announced I think was it Friday. I announced Friday or Saturday. I was making a huge video

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,120
I figured I have it up by Saturday. That's why no video come out on Saturday, by the way

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,160
I had planned for it to come out then. Well, I didn't finish it in time

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,620
So I worked all through Saturday aside from the weekly sip

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,040
I worked all through Sunday and then I said, you know, I'll get it on Monday. Sure

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,960
Oh, I didn't get it on Monday. I'm nearly done though. I'm nearly done. I'll be able to get it out

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,560
Tuesday morning, so you know what Tuesday morning drop by it's gonna be one of those really big videos like the three forms of fascism

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Or like the Antonio Gramsci video very long at least an hour long. I'm gonna be premiering it. It's gonna be great

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,420
Make sure you drop in make sure your super chat

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,260
I definitely need the money right now

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,120
Some IRL things happen that I talked about on the weekly sip the TLDR is that my car is fucked

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,880
I gotta get a new car. That's as simple as that. Anyway enough of that nonsense

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,160
We are here check out this week's round of tick-tock gobbledygook, let's go

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:09,280
This comment is asking if I could prove that all 2,000 of the billionaires are evil people. Yeah. Yeah, I can

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,520
Oh my god, I can already tell this is gonna be cancerous. All right, Tormund Giantsbane. Tell me all about it

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,560
So first let's put a billion into perspective

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,400
1 million seconds is about 12 days

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,160
1 billion seconds is just under 32 years

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,960
Which means that if you earned one dollar every single set number big and never number bigger any of it

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,400
It would take you about 32 years to earn a single billion dollars if you earned

23
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,680
$5,000 a day from the time that Columbus started his infamous voyage. It would take you about

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,320
527 years to earn a single billion dollars and there are people out there with

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,800
Multiple billions of dollars. Holy shit. I was just joking. His argument actually is a big number is bigger

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,480
Listen, I don't know if you value your time or your labor at one dollar a day

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,200
I don't know if that's your your personal level of worth, but basically I'm sure he's gonna get into it

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,080
He's gonna get into some sort of labor theory of value

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm sure that's where we can be the next leg of the tick-tock

30
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,420
The reason some people make more money is because their labor is more valuable to more people

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,740
How hard you work can actually affect certain things for sure

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,660
But ultimately it's how valuable your labor is based on that math. We can conclude that there's no ethical way to

33
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,620
Billion really because there is no physically possible way to earn that money

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,340
Solely through the value of your own labor actually very very very dumb because not all labor is created equal

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,780
A guy digging a hole with a shovel is gonna get a whole lot less

36
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,020
Digging done with a whole lot more of his own energy expended than a guy digging a hole with a backhoe

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,780
It's not equal and it shouldn't be equal which means that in order to become a billionaire

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,500
You have to steal the labor value of thousands

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,740
If not millions of people and we know that this is the case and we know that this is the case because between

40
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:11,580
1979 oh god this statistic one the average productivity meaning the average amount of labor value produced by the workers has increased by

41
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,620
64.6%

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,980
Meanwhile, the average wage of workers has only increased by about seventeen point three percent. That's it. Okay, you want to know why?

43
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,160
Okay, hold on. Yeah, that's difference of nearly fifteen labor value right difference of nearly fifty percent labor value

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,600
Got it. You want to know why this is the case?

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,480
It's because productivity and value aren't the same thing

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,120
Laborers become more productive once they have let's say better education or better tools. There's a whole bunch of different factors here

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
It's not just that owners are

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,240
scraping surplus value off the backs of the laborers people at the very top of businesses still do labor in them and the fact that

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,680
Their labor affects the entire business and therefore all the all the people who shop at that business

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,000
Use that business a service that's what makes their labor more valuable because they affect more people

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,920
I've outlined this in several videos. I'll just do it again real quick

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,960
Let's say they work at a grocery store, right? So you put up a hundred boxes in an hour

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,440
Okay

54
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,040
During that hour of work your labor has affected

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,600
100 potential customers right at some point hundred customers will come by and buy those hundred boxes and so your labor affects a hundred other

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,720
People that's what gives it its value now

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,260
Let's say you have a guy who's a receiver and he's taking the product off the delivery truck and putting it in the back room

58
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,700
He's gonna be using a tool generally a hand jack or a power jack and he's gonna be moving pallets and he can move pallets

59
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,500
Way faster with his tool than you can moving individual boxes with your hands

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,220
He might move a thousand boxes from the truck the back room in the same hour that you move a hundred boxes

61
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,980
From the back room to the store floor his labor

62
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,260
Even though it's the same amount of time and also probably less labor intensive for him personally his labor affects

63
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,140
1,000 customers instead of a hundred so he makes more money

64
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,100
Then you have the store manager whose labor affects every customer in the store the district manager who affects the customers of every single

65
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,540
Person who shops at any store in the district all the way up the chain your labor affects more people you get paid more

66
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,540
For it. It's as simple as that already

67
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,300
Billionaires are stealing 50% or more of their workers labor value so that can sit around in

68
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,980
investment funds and stock portfolios providing nothing of value to society

69
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,620
Does even know what a stock portfolio is like an investment? Do you even know what these things are?

70
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,420
Okay, when you buy stock what you're doing is you're buying a portion of a company. All right, so there's a company

71
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,260
It's going for sale. You can buy stock in the company

72
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,300
So you own like ten you pay the company X amount of dollars you own like five stocks and like five percent of the company

73
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,740
Or something, right? The reason companies go public is because they need money for expansion

74
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:37,900
You know

75
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,180
The company is booming so you have a shop right and it's booming and you use it's time for you to like branch out buy

76
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,820
Other locations open other shops, you know grow the business

77
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,300
You can take a loan out but loans have interest on them or you could go public and

78
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:58,020
Sell part ownership of your company and then use that capital that you gain from selling the ownership to expand the business

79
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,540
So when money is sitting in a stock portfolio, you know what it's actually doing

80
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:09,100
It's enabling businesses to expand which allows them to hire more people and provide more services to the community

81
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,900
So it's not doing nothing sitting in a stock portfolio you fucking moron. There are currently over

82
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,980
582 thousand homeless people in the United States many of which are children. Hold on

83
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,620
582 thousand homeless people

84
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Population of the USA

85
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,060
331.9 million. Okay. Okay, so it's

86
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,460
0.0015 percent of the country is homeless, you know, that's pretty good

87
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,820
The reason there's a lot of homeless people in America is because there's a lot of fucking people in America and in the year 2020

88
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,300
There were more than 34 million food insecure people in the United States

89
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,300
that's about

90
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,100
10% of the population that doesn't know where their next meal is going to come from the condition of not having access to sufficient food

91
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,220
Or food of an adequate quality to meet one's basic needs. Okay, like

92
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,500
Sufficient food means you don't have enough food. You're just going poor you have no food

93
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,180
You're hungry but food of an adequate quality that could just mean that they're eating shit

94
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,780
Because I don't know if you've noticed but poor people in the United States and in the Western world in general

95
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,060
They're not skinny. They're not starving. They're fat. All right, they're eating way too many carbs

96
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,140
That's a problem that we have to solve but it's not the same thing as just starving people everywhere

97
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,100
You know food insecurity is not the same thing as hunger and I think that's why this guy's not saying hunger

98
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,380
Now, do you know how much it would cost to end homelessness in the United States according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development?

99
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,620
It would cost 20 billion dollars to end homelessness in the United States a lot of that money

100
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:47,200
They have actually isn't cash its assets and if everyone sells their assets to get liquid cash one

101
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,620
They won't get as much liquid cash as they think and two there's no buyers for assets that expensive

102
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,700
Also, I'm gonna have to rely on the old-school d-boonkers, but apparently that 20 billion dollar figure

103
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,860
It's actually not that accurate would likely cost significantly more than 20 billion to house America's homeless population

104
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,760
After factoring in the expansion of the federal housing voucher program and affordable housing development

105
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,980
Yeah, it ain't just 20 billion dude. It's a lot more. Of course his answers just take more from the billionaires

106
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,500
But I mean as I said, there's no liquid cash there. It's all assets

107
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,560
This guy just doesn't understand what he's talking about. He doesn't understand economics doesn't understand finance

108
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,900
He doesn't understand why things are the way they are

109
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,900
He sees one little slice of society and thinks oh it needs to be this way because he has no actual information

110
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:38,460
Maybe this is why Hollywood's replacing all these redheads with black people because they're actually stupid. Okay. Now that's maybe that's a little too far

111
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Sorry, sorry, my redheaded listeners

112
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,140
This has to be a troll

113
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,140
I

114
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,380
Okay, this is a troll this is a troll

115
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,700
Wow, okay. Okay. I thought maybe that was like like the cops weren't in on it initially still pretty funny though

116
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,060
Then don't post it I've had to record this for context don't do it

117
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,260
Then mom ripped up my kinky drawings called me disgusting and gave me a lifelong guilt complex for having a pregnancy finish

118
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,280
Well summer you wanted to see my drawing

119
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Why

120
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
Here's one I did in high school

121
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,780
So guilty hated myself afterwards. Jesus Christ. You should paper you should feel guilty

122
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:52,180
And though I perceive myself as being completely unable to draw so more often than not I get all missions like this

123
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,020
or this

124
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:02,060
Here's my fursona and address, oh, of course very mean I'm male assigned at birth this basically counts as M preg

Mpreg fetish

131

134
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,260
