00:00.000 --> 00:05.820
Hello everyone, welcome to TikTok Tuesday on Monday night, the main reason for this is I'm still working on that giant video

00:05.820 --> 00:10.700
I don't know if you pay attention to my Twitter or my discord or the community posts on the YouTube channel

00:10.700 --> 00:15.260
But I announced I think was it Friday. I announced Friday or Saturday. I was making a huge video

00:15.260 --> 00:18.120
I figured I have it up by Saturday. That's why no video come out on Saturday, by the way

00:18.120 --> 00:22.160
I had planned for it to come out then. Well, I didn't finish it in time

00:22.160 --> 00:24.620
So I worked all through Saturday aside from the weekly sip

00:24.620 --> 00:28.040
I worked all through Sunday and then I said, you know, I'll get it on Monday. Sure

00:28.040 --> 00:32.960
Oh, I didn't get it on Monday. I'm nearly done though. I'm nearly done. I'll be able to get it out

00:33.600 --> 00:39.560
Tuesday morning, so you know what Tuesday morning drop by it's gonna be one of those really big videos like the three forms of fascism

00:39.560 --> 00:44.360
Or like the Antonio Gramsci video very long at least an hour long. I'm gonna be premiering it. It's gonna be great

00:44.360 --> 00:46.420
Make sure you drop in make sure your super chat

00:46.420 --> 00:48.260
I definitely need the money right now

00:48.260 --> 00:53.120
Some IRL things happen that I talked about on the weekly sip the TLDR is that my car is fucked

00:53.120 --> 00:55.880
I gotta get a new car. That's as simple as that. Anyway enough of that nonsense

00:56.160 --> 01:02.160
We are here check out this week's round of tick-tock gobbledygook, let's go

01:02.360 --> 01:09.280
This comment is asking if I could prove that all 2,000 of the billionaires are evil people. Yeah. Yeah, I can

01:09.280 --> 01:14.520
Oh my god, I can already tell this is gonna be cancerous. All right, Tormund Giantsbane. Tell me all about it

01:14.520 --> 01:17.560
So first let's put a billion into perspective

01:18.320 --> 01:21.400
1 million seconds is about 12 days

01:21.880 --> 01:25.160
1 billion seconds is just under 32 years

01:25.840 --> 01:32.960
Which means that if you earned one dollar every single set number big and never number bigger any of it

01:32.960 --> 01:39.400
It would take you about 32 years to earn a single billion dollars if you earned

01:40.660 --> 01:45.680
$5,000 a day from the time that Columbus started his infamous voyage. It would take you about

01:46.520 --> 01:52.320
527 years to earn a single billion dollars and there are people out there with

01:52.920 --> 01:57.800
Multiple billions of dollars. Holy shit. I was just joking. His argument actually is a big number is bigger

01:58.080 --> 02:03.480
Listen, I don't know if you value your time or your labor at one dollar a day

02:03.480 --> 02:09.200
I don't know if that's your your personal level of worth, but basically I'm sure he's gonna get into it

02:09.200 --> 02:11.080
He's gonna get into some sort of labor theory of value

02:11.080 --> 02:12.940
I'm sure that's where we can be the next leg of the tick-tock

02:12.980 --> 02:18.420
The reason some people make more money is because their labor is more valuable to more people

02:18.420 --> 02:20.740
How hard you work can actually affect certain things for sure

02:20.740 --> 02:26.660
But ultimately it's how valuable your labor is based on that math. We can conclude that there's no ethical way to

02:27.380 --> 02:31.620
Billion really because there is no physically possible way to earn that money

02:31.860 --> 02:39.340
Solely through the value of your own labor actually very very very dumb because not all labor is created equal

02:39.340 --> 02:43.780
A guy digging a hole with a shovel is gonna get a whole lot less

02:44.180 --> 02:50.020
Digging done with a whole lot more of his own energy expended than a guy digging a hole with a backhoe

02:50.020 --> 02:54.780
It's not equal and it shouldn't be equal which means that in order to become a billionaire

02:54.780 --> 02:58.500
You have to steal the labor value of thousands

02:58.500 --> 03:03.740
If not millions of people and we know that this is the case and we know that this is the case because between

03:04.220 --> 03:11.580
1979 oh god this statistic one the average productivity meaning the average amount of labor value produced by the workers has increased by

03:12.380 --> 03:13.620
64.6%

03:13.620 --> 03:20.980
Meanwhile, the average wage of workers has only increased by about seventeen point three percent. That's it. Okay, you want to know why?

03:21.420 --> 03:27.160
Okay, hold on. Yeah, that's difference of nearly fifteen labor value right difference of nearly fifty percent labor value

03:27.160 --> 03:29.600
Got it. You want to know why this is the case?

03:30.040 --> 03:34.480
It's because productivity and value aren't the same thing

03:35.080 --> 03:42.120
Laborers become more productive once they have let's say better education or better tools. There's a whole bunch of different factors here

03:42.120 --> 03:44.120
It's not just that owners are

03:44.400 --> 03:50.240
scraping surplus value off the backs of the laborers people at the very top of businesses still do labor in them and the fact that

03:50.240 --> 03:55.680
Their labor affects the entire business and therefore all the all the people who shop at that business

03:55.760 --> 04:01.000
Use that business a service that's what makes their labor more valuable because they affect more people

04:01.000 --> 04:02.920
I've outlined this in several videos. I'll just do it again real quick

04:02.920 --> 04:05.960
Let's say they work at a grocery store, right? So you put up a hundred boxes in an hour

04:05.960 --> 04:06.440
Okay

04:06.440 --> 04:09.040
During that hour of work your labor has affected

04:09.160 --> 04:15.600
100 potential customers right at some point hundred customers will come by and buy those hundred boxes and so your labor affects a hundred other

04:15.600 --> 04:17.720
People that's what gives it its value now

04:17.720 --> 04:24.260
Let's say you have a guy who's a receiver and he's taking the product off the delivery truck and putting it in the back room

04:24.260 --> 04:29.700
He's gonna be using a tool generally a hand jack or a power jack and he's gonna be moving pallets and he can move pallets

04:29.700 --> 04:33.500
Way faster with his tool than you can moving individual boxes with your hands

04:33.500 --> 04:39.220
He might move a thousand boxes from the truck the back room in the same hour that you move a hundred boxes

04:39.340 --> 04:41.980
From the back room to the store floor his labor

04:42.140 --> 04:48.260
Even though it's the same amount of time and also probably less labor intensive for him personally his labor affects

04:48.700 --> 04:51.140
1,000 customers instead of a hundred so he makes more money

04:51.140 --> 04:57.100
Then you have the store manager whose labor affects every customer in the store the district manager who affects the customers of every single

04:57.260 --> 05:02.540
Person who shops at any store in the district all the way up the chain your labor affects more people you get paid more

05:02.540 --> 05:04.540
For it. It's as simple as that already

05:04.700 --> 05:10.300
Billionaires are stealing 50% or more of their workers labor value so that can sit around in

05:10.620 --> 05:14.980
investment funds and stock portfolios providing nothing of value to society

05:15.380 --> 05:19.620
Does even know what a stock portfolio is like an investment? Do you even know what these things are?

05:19.660 --> 05:24.420
Okay, when you buy stock what you're doing is you're buying a portion of a company. All right, so there's a company

05:24.420 --> 05:27.260
It's going for sale. You can buy stock in the company

05:27.260 --> 05:32.300
So you own like ten you pay the company X amount of dollars you own like five stocks and like five percent of the company

05:32.300 --> 05:37.740
Or something, right? The reason companies go public is because they need money for expansion

05:37.740 --> 05:37.900
You know

05:37.900 --> 05:43.180
The company is booming so you have a shop right and it's booming and you use it's time for you to like branch out buy

05:43.180 --> 05:45.820
Other locations open other shops, you know grow the business

05:46.180 --> 05:50.300
You can take a loan out but loans have interest on them or you could go public and

05:50.780 --> 05:58.020
Sell part ownership of your company and then use that capital that you gain from selling the ownership to expand the business

05:58.020 --> 06:02.540
So when money is sitting in a stock portfolio, you know what it's actually doing

06:02.540 --> 06:09.100
It's enabling businesses to expand which allows them to hire more people and provide more services to the community

06:09.100 --> 06:14.900
So it's not doing nothing sitting in a stock portfolio you fucking moron. There are currently over

06:15.340 --> 06:20.980
582 thousand homeless people in the United States many of which are children. Hold on

06:21.620 --> 06:23.620
582 thousand homeless people

06:25.580 --> 06:27.580
Population of the USA

06:27.940 --> 06:30.060
331.9 million. Okay. Okay, so it's

06:31.660 --> 06:37.460
0.0015 percent of the country is homeless, you know, that's pretty good

06:39.020 --> 06:44.820
The reason there's a lot of homeless people in America is because there's a lot of fucking people in America and in the year 2020

06:44.820 --> 06:49.300
There were more than 34 million food insecure people in the United States

06:49.300 --> 06:50.300
that's about

06:50.300 --> 06:57.100
10% of the population that doesn't know where their next meal is going to come from the condition of not having access to sufficient food

06:57.100 --> 07:02.220
Or food of an adequate quality to meet one's basic needs. Okay, like

07:03.180 --> 07:06.500
Sufficient food means you don't have enough food. You're just going poor you have no food

07:06.500 --> 07:10.180
You're hungry but food of an adequate quality that could just mean that they're eating shit

07:10.900 --> 07:15.780
Because I don't know if you've noticed but poor people in the United States and in the Western world in general

07:15.780 --> 07:20.060
They're not skinny. They're not starving. They're fat. All right, they're eating way too many carbs

07:20.180 --> 07:24.140
That's a problem that we have to solve but it's not the same thing as just starving people everywhere

07:24.140 --> 07:30.100
You know food insecurity is not the same thing as hunger and I think that's why this guy's not saying hunger

07:30.100 --> 07:35.380
Now, do you know how much it would cost to end homelessness in the United States according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development?

07:35.380 --> 07:40.620
It would cost 20 billion dollars to end homelessness in the United States a lot of that money

07:40.620 --> 07:47.200
They have actually isn't cash its assets and if everyone sells their assets to get liquid cash one

07:47.200 --> 07:52.620
They won't get as much liquid cash as they think and two there's no buyers for assets that expensive

07:52.620 --> 07:58.700
Also, I'm gonna have to rely on the old-school d-boonkers, but apparently that 20 billion dollar figure

07:58.700 --> 08:03.860
It's actually not that accurate would likely cost significantly more than 20 billion to house America's homeless population

08:04.020 --> 08:08.760
After factoring in the expansion of the federal housing voucher program and affordable housing development

08:08.940 --> 08:14.980
Yeah, it ain't just 20 billion dude. It's a lot more. Of course his answers just take more from the billionaires

08:14.980 --> 08:18.500
But I mean as I said, there's no liquid cash there. It's all assets

08:18.620 --> 08:23.560
This guy just doesn't understand what he's talking about. He doesn't understand economics doesn't understand finance

08:23.560 --> 08:25.900
He doesn't understand why things are the way they are

08:25.900 --> 08:31.900
He sees one little slice of society and thinks oh it needs to be this way because he has no actual information

08:31.900 --> 08:38.460
Maybe this is why Hollywood's replacing all these redheads with black people because they're actually stupid. Okay. Now that's maybe that's a little too far

08:38.460 --> 08:40.460
Sorry, sorry, my redheaded listeners

08:57.140 --> 08:59.140
This has to be a troll

08:59.140 --> 09:01.140
I

09:01.380 --> 09:03.380
Okay, this is a troll this is a troll

09:07.880 --> 09:13.700
Wow, okay. Okay. I thought maybe that was like like the cops weren't in on it initially still pretty funny though

09:18.260 --> 09:22.060
Then don't post it I've had to record this for context don't do it

09:22.060 --> 09:28.260
Then mom ripped up my kinky drawings called me disgusting and gave me a lifelong guilt complex for having a pregnancy finish

09:30.140 --> 09:32.280
Well summer you wanted to see my drawing

09:34.700 --> 09:36.700
Why

09:37.620 --> 09:39.620
Here's one I did in high school

09:40.220 --> 09:45.780
So guilty hated myself afterwards. Jesus Christ. You should paper you should feel guilty

09:45.780 --> 09:52.180
And though I perceive myself as being completely unable to draw so more often than not I get all missions like this

09:53.020 --> 09:55.020
or this

09:55.260 --> 10:02.060
Here's my fursona and address, oh, of course very mean I'm male assigned at birth this basically counts as M preg

10:02.220 --> 10:04.220
Here's my among this character

10:05.700 --> 10:10.940
My blood-borne characters my planned vtuber persona

10:12.820 --> 10:18.620

10:18.620 --> 10:21.980
How do we see in there? We saw um trans

10:22.740 --> 10:23.900
stepchild

10:23.940 --> 10:25.300
Mpreg fetish

10:25.300 --> 10:31.380
Oppressive parents like this person has just won the lottery of shit that makes your life fucked up

10:31.380 --> 10:38.260
Oh and furry, of course my god. What a what a way to end it. Okay, guys, I think that's that's enough

10:38.420 --> 10:41.980
That's that's enough. I need to go do something else. In fact, you know what?

10:41.980 --> 10:45.260
I think I think after once if you're watching this right when it comes up

10:45.260 --> 10:49.000
I'll be streaming right after so I just click over to the stream say hello
