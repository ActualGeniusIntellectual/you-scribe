00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,460
Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly number 8 for the 12th of August 2018.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,940
And as you can see, I've started on my desktop.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,460
Well I've done that for a reason, and that reason is, I've been very public that the

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,120
next video I'm making is on Alex Jones, and I have the script right there along with my

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,600
social media research folder, however these six other scripts are all in various stages

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,640
of completion, so I figured we'll do a quick impromptu vote on which one you want to see

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
next.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,760
We've got a script on cultural appropriation, a script on journalists are not a protected

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,180
class, a script on forced civility, a script on Anthony Burch, a script on the origin of

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,740
Islamophobia, and a script on Boogie2988.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,740
So here's what we'll do.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,820
The first person to comment that they want one of these six scripts, I will super like

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,080
that comment, and only that comment.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,160
So hopefully those six comments will rise to the top, and then all you have to do is

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,100
simply thumbs up the topic that you want to see next, and after the Alex Jones video is

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,500
done, and presuming that nothing major happens in that time, the next video I do will be

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,960
one of these six, based on your votes.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,500
And I actually got a lot of positive feedback last week from my coffee drinking during that

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:33,900
episode, so here guys, just take a listen.

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,020
This time, I'm drinking regular coffee, but instead of milk or cream, I'm using chocolate

21
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,620
milk in the coffee, and it's actually pretty fucking incredible.

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,640
Let's get to today's social justice nonsense.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,920
Here we have Professor Slam's hegemonic masculinity of homeless men.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,400
I mean look at this guy, isn't he just the spitting image of white male privilege?

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,400
A feminist professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada recently published a book chapter

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,120
documenting the myriad ways homeless men allegedly perpetuate hegemonic masculinity while discussing

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,880
their hardships.

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,300
Of course this would come from fucking Wilfrid Laurier, for those of you who don't know,

29
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,820
that was the school that raked Lindsay Shepard over the coals for playing in a neutral manner

30
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,340
not even agreeing with him a video of Jordan Peterson to her students.

31
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,560
The book chapter, When a Man's Home is Not a Castle, Hegemonic Masculinity Among Men

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,760
Experiencing Homelessness, was published last Wednesday by Professor Erin Dege in a book

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,400
she co-edited on patriarchy in psychiatric wards and homeless shelters.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I guess the fruit was just way too low hanging to go after people like Harvey Weinstein or

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,960
anybody else in the top, because if you wanted an example of hegemonic masculinity and of

36
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,520
white patriarchy, I mean you could just go there, you can go to Hollywood, you can go

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,580
to any kind of upper echelons of any society, and you'll probably find some kind of example

38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,580
of that.

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:12,620
Maybe go for the homeless men, because even if you're homeless if you have a penis you're

40
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,620
oppressive.

41
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,740
The goal of her research, she explains, was to assess the ways hypermasculinity is performed

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,620
among men experiencing homelessness, and to do this she interviewed 27 homeless men and

43
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,620
spent an additional 296 hours spying on them in homeless shelters.

44
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,280
While research on vulnerable people typically requires informed consent and approval by

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,140
an ethics board, it is unclear if Dege sought this.

46
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,900
Imagine my shock!

47
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,940
She declined to comment on this when emailed by PJ Media, and her research makes no mention

48
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,080
of ethics review.

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,900
Of course it doesn't, because these people don't care about ethics.

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,500
To them, ethics is kind of a roadblock, it's something that's in the way.

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,060
Maybe ethics is part of the white patriarchy, if it's holding a female professor down it

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,520
has to be part of the white patriarchy, so maybe ethical standards is just doublespeak

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,200
for men trying to do her transformative research or whatever the fuck she's going to call it.

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,380
During interviews with homeless men, Dege claims she learned that many aspire to hegemonic

55
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,540
masculinity, which she defines as the type of masculinity that serves to fortify the

56
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,280
dominance of men and ultimately subordinate women.

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,240
Do you mean maybe that they aspire to not be homeless, or hold down a job, or own a

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,900
car, or a house, or have a girlfriend, or a wife, or kids?

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,560
Maybe being homeless has made them desire a generic, unremarkable white picket fence

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
life because that is just so much better than living on the fucking streets?

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,260
I wonder if this person would go so far as to say that just general desires to get a

62
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,880
girlfriend by the non-violent n-cells would be hegemonic masculinity.

63
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,280
If you're a lonely guy and you're like, man I wish I could have a girlfriend, I wish I

64
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,200
had somebody to love and cherish and share my life with, but I've just been completely

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,600
unlucky in love, that's hegemonic masculinity.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,840
I bet that's how she thinks.

67
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,240
However, she finds that it's difficult for homeless men to achieve this.

68
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,440
Without the trappings of a successful life, such as a home or a career, many men instead

69
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,280
develop what Dege refers to as compensatory masculinity to cope with their failed status.

70
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,240
This type of masculinity is worse than hegemonic masculinity, though not as bad as toxic masculinity,

71
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,480
and it involves men emphasizing whatever hyper-masculine traits they can within their stratified social

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,620
status to the detriment, allegedly, of women.

73
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,040
This is what I said a few videos back in the Starbucks and Belligerents of Black Subculture

74
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
video.

75
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:53,080
This is the one I talked about how in the absence of money or social status or job or

76
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,680
ability to get ahead or property or anything like that, men will often resort to brute

77
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,040
force as a way to create a social status, and nine times out of ten the reason that

78
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,680
happens is because of perpetual fatherlessness.

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,720
And just so we're clear, who is it that constantly talks about the breakup of the nuclear family?

80
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,480
That would be radical feminists.

81
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,120
Throughout her paper, as she writes up her research findings, Dege ridicules these men

82
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,860
for everything from reinforcing gender stereotypes, to refusing to show emotion, to talking about

83
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,220
how their ex-wives stole money from them.

84
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,560
This person sounds like a heartless sociopath at this point.

85
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,800
I have a feeling that feminist academia at this point is just pumping out these heartless

86
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,380
sociopaths who see homeless men, men who are quite literally at the bottom of the social

87
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,420
strata and just shit on them, just because they can.

88
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,600
For example, Julian, a homeless 45 year old man with severe anxiety, was accused by Dege

89
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,360
of perpetuating stereotypes when he confessed that I'm ashamed that I have problems, like

90
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,800
guys in our society are not supposed to have problems.

91
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,960
Oh look, it's actually Dege playing her part in perpetuating this toxic masculinity that

92
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,240
she rails against because I assume she was sitting there with a fucking white male tears

93
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,120
mug sipping on it as she was listening to this guy's story.

94
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,920
Dege also interviewed Ron, a 41 year old homeless man with depression and PTSD.

95
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,260
Ron used various drugs to cope with his mental health issues and by age 41, this had taken

96
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,720
a heavy toll on him, causing breathing problems and muscle weakness.

97
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,480
I walked down the street and like a little girl could have killed me.

98
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,160
That's how weak I was, Ron told Dege during an interview.

99
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,120
Strapolating from this comment, Dege then suggested that Ron somehow views women and

100
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
mass negatively.

101
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,120
That is the height of conceit that you're going to take this guy's terrible life story

102
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,260
and turn it around to be something about yourself.

103
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,900
For Ron, the feminine subjectively acts as the ultimate exemplar of physical weakness

104
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,560
and the most absurd hyperbole of who constitutes a threat, Dege wrote in her essay.

105
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:24,880
Not surprisingly, Dege writes that the only alternative for these men is to become more

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,400
emotional insofar as men should comfort, display, and work through their emotions, adding to

107
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,540
the complexity of what it means to be masculine.

108
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,120
But even men who are open about their emotions are problematic.

109
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,700
If a man opens up about his emotions, Dege laments that it still allows masculinity to

110
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,340
prevail without necessarily challenging the patriarchal foundation upon which it rests

111
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,320
– catch 22.

112
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,660
So basically, there's no winning, all men are toxic and evil, especially homeless men,

113
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,840
and this person is a complete fucking moral leper, which has also been awarded at least

114
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,460
$195,000 by the Canadian government to research this shit.

115
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,560
This is fucking ridiculous.

116
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,000
But let's keep going down the rabbit hole of ridiculousness with, new research shows

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,400
a vast majority of cis people won't date trans people.

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,540
A recent study attempts to quantify the extent of trans discrimination when it comes to romantic

119
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,080
and sexual relationships.

120
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,140
See, when I was younger I was always told to just say no if you didn't like the way

121
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,860
someone was coming on to you, but I guess nowadays your sexual preferences are considered

122
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,080
discriminatory.

123
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,140
Considering the discrimination that trans people face on a daily basis, it comes as

124
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,040
no surprise that trans people are overlooked when it comes to dating.

125
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,060
Two Canadian researchers recently asked almost 1000 cisgender folks if they would date a

126
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,700
trans person in a new study, holy shit this article is actually written like an SJW who's

127
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
tweeting.

128
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:58,260
About 150 participants, all but 7 cisgender, ranging in age from 18 to 81, were asked to

129
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,800
indicate which genders they would consider dating.

130
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,660
The options included cisgender man, cisgender woman, trans man, trans woman, or gender queer,

131
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,500
and participants could select as many genders as they wanted.

132
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,820
Only 12% of all participants selected trans woman and or trans man.

133
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,140
That is normal isn't it, I mean, what is the percentage of society that is actually

134
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
gay?

135
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,180
Isn't it around like 8% or 12% or something like that?

136
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,300
That actually seems in line.

137
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:30,180
You are not going to turn a society 100% bisexual, it is never going to be much higher than that.

138
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,580
Those who would consider dating a trans person didn't differ in race or ethnicity, but

139
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,060
were somewhat older, more likely to hold a university degree, and unsurprisingly, less

140
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,540
likely to be religious than those who would not date a trans person.

141
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,780
But some of the most striking differences were in regards to participants' gender

142
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,080
and sexual orientation.

143
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,120
Basically all heterosexuals excluded trans folks from their dating pool, that is in fact

144
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,100
the definition of heterosexual.

145
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,880
Only 1.8% of straight women and 3.3% of straight men chose a trans person of either binary

146
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
gender.

147
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,560
But most non-heterosexuals weren't down for dating a trans person either, with only

148
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,060
11.5% of gay men and 29% of lesbians being trans inclusive in their dating preferences.

149
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,940
Well that's because, one, I forget the exact terminology, Blair White used it, it was a

150
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:28,660
long psychological term, but attraction to a trans person is its own sexuality outside

151
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,740
of gay, straight, or bi.

152
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,200
Secondly, and this is the more ridiculous explanation, if you actually believe in there

153
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,460
being more than two genders, well then if straight people are only attracted to a specific

154
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:48,080
gender and gay people are only attracted to a specific gender, well if trans people

155
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:55,340
are a different third gender or an 8th gender or a 1200th gender, gay or straight wouldn't

156
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,540
encompass that.

157
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,140
Bisexual, queer, and non-binary participants, they were all combined into one group, were

158
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,620
most open to having a trans partner, but even among them almost half did not select either

159
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,160
trans man or trans woman.

160
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,760
I can only assume that those three groups were all combined into one group, because

161
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,860
there aren't really that many of them, even in a pool of a thousand people.

162
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,200
This is the kind of minority we're talking about here.

163
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,460
And when SJWs want to bend a society, this is Canada, a society of 36 million people

164
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,220
to what statistically rounds out to be what, like a couple thousand?

165
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,380
It's ridiculous, it's ridiculous.

166
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,180
Specific relationships are one of the most important sources of social support for adults.

167
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,640
The fact that most cis people would not consider trans people as potential dating partners

168
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,660
is yet another serious risk factor for increased psychological and physical health problems

169
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,900
among the trans population.

170
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:57,840
Well, while that's true, and while that sucks, the ability for cis people, and really, all

171
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,600
people, to date who they want to date, and to be attracted to who they want to be attracted

172
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,760
to, trumps any of that.

173
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,680
You're not going to go to a cis person at gunpoint and say you must date this trans

174
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,300
person for the good of the trans person.

175
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,480
It's not going to happen.

176
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,000
The high rates of trans exclusion for potential dating pools are undoubtedly due in part to

177
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,680
cis normativity, cis sexism, and transphobia.

178
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,680
How about it's because you don't find them attractive and that's not transphobia?

179
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,880
You can still not be a transphobe and still be like, yeah, but I don't find you attractive.

180
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,600
Does it work with gay people too?

181
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,800
If you're straight and a gay person hits on you and you're like, listen, I have nothing

182
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,840
against gay people, I'm just not interested, does that make you a homophobe?

183
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,260
It's also possible that at least some of the trans exclusion is due to the fact that for

184
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,680
some people, sexual orientation might be not just about a partner's gender identity, but

185
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,260
attraction to specific body types and or judgment of reproductive capabilities.

186
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,700
This is where the whole feminine B-ness comes in, isn't it?

187
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,820
These results clearly indicate that although the visibility of transgender people is on

188
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:10,220
the rise, we still have a long way to go to reach trans equality.

189
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,620
Trans equality means rights.

190
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,100
That's what it means.

191
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,060
It does not mean that everyone needs to be attracted to you.

192
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,920
It does not mean that everyone's going to like you.

193
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,300
It means rights.

194
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,400
It means it means legal rights.

195
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,500
It means human rights.

196
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,560
It does not mean that you walk down the street and everyone thinks that you're a fucking

197
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
bombshell.

198
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,240
That's not how the world works and it's never going to get there.

199
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,200
And in fact, let's watch some of these oppressions clash against one another.

200
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:47,120
Transgender model called Muslim airport worker, terrorist in two hour meltdown after she misheard

201
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,960
ma'am for man.

202
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,000
So guys, who's more oppressed?

203
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,760
Who's more oppressed and who's more oppressive?

204
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,620
Is it the transgender model who called a Muslim a terrorist or the Muslim airport worker who

205
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,120
could have called a transgender model a man?

206
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,200
I mean, I know that he said ma'am, but let's just say for the sake of argument, which one

207
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,360
of those two is more oppressed and which one of those two is more oppressive?

208
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,760
A transgender model called a Muslim airport security staffer a terrorist after she mistakenly

209
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,720
heard them call her a man.

210
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,380
The security worker had actually said ma'am.

211
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,760
Francesca Camica, 23, shouted the comments during a two hour meltdown at London's Heathrow

212
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,000
airport while traveling to Italy for a breast augmentation.

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,880
Camica also got in the face of one officer and shouted, this guy hates transgenders and

214
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
wishes me dead.

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're the terrorist.

216
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,560
Camica, who was identified as female on both her British and Italian passports, told the

217
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,440
court, when someone calls me man, I feel so desolated.

218
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,480
She was convicted of using threatening behavior towards Mustafa Abbas and supervisor Fahad

219
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,160
Arshad on September 17th and was conditionally discharged for two years.

220
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,800
She was ordered to pay each victim 50 pounds compensation and 750 pounds costs.

221
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,040
Mr. Abbas insisted that he addressed Camica as ma'am during secondary security checks

222
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,240
and busy terminal four.

223
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,780
That's when the abuse began, he told the trial.

224
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,320
She said, don't talk to me like a dog.

225
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
You need to learn some education, you fucking idiot.

226
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,280
She said it with disgust and was looking down at me and made me feel worthless like

227
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,460
I am nothing as if I am a peasant.

228
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,660
She said, you earn six pounds an hour and you think you are God.

229
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,800
He reported the incident to supervisor Mr. Arshad, who told the court, she refused to

230
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,720
stop and completely lost control, just mad I couldn't speak to her.

231
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,600
She completely lost the plot saying that she was transgender and that I wished death on

232
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,040
all transgenders.

233
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
She was in a blind rage.

234
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,380
I mean, considering considering the state of Islam right now, it's not an unreasonable

235
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,740
thing to jump to conclusion to, but of course she was still acting ridiculously.

236
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,980
She pointed at my beard and said, I should be afraid of you.

237
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,360
You are the terrorist.

238
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,060
She said I was homosexual and made an oral sex gesture with her hand.

239
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,260
I have never come across anyone that angry or unpredictable in seven years at Heathrow.

240
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,600
I felt intimidated when she came close to my face and poked my shoulder with her fingers.

241
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,560
She said, you're peasants, I'll buy this fucking airport, this fucking plane.

242
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,840
To be called a terrorist because of how I look is disgusting and she lost control with

243
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,260
the police as well.

244
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,120
You think that she would understand that if she was somebody who was called a man because

245
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,560
of how she looks and she felt disgusted by it as she should, then maybe she should also

246
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,820
understand that to call a brown guy with a beard a terrorist because of how he looks

247
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,280
is equally disgusting.

248
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,100
The court heard Kamika also shouted, I've been a woman for 20 years.

249
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,580
So you, you had the surgery when you were three years old to call me, sir is a crime.

250
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,920
I've got a diplomatic passport.

251
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,140
You can't do anything to me.

252
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
I know my rights.

253
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,820
Kamika, who has a PhD in law was upset.

254
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,760
There was no Jewish Torah on which to swear an oath.

255
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,020
She told the court it's okay.

256
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,400
My rates are breached every day.

257
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,180
What a fucking snowflake.

258
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,340
But let's switch back to a biological CIS woman for a bit.

259
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
Here's polygon.

260
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
Oh yeah.

261
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,300
Where did your ads go?

262
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,500
I blocked them.

263
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,900
Ninja explains his choice not to stream with female gamers.

264
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,760
The only way to avoid the rumors is to not play with them at all.

265
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,060
Now for those of you who don't know, Ninja is the biggest streamer on Twitch right now.

266
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,600
He streams mostly Fortnite, I think it's almost almost completely Fortnite.

267
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,520
And he makes something like a quarter million dollars a month on Twitch.

268
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,800
He has, I think it's in the six digits regularly whenever he streams.

269
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,520
Like he is the biggest guy on Twitch right now.

270
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,520
And I want, I want it to be known before we read this article that he's married.

271
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
All right.

272
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,560
I don't think his wife streams with him, but he's married.

273
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,400
He's monogamous.

274
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,160
And that's, I guess he, I guess he, that's how he wants to keep things.

275
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,440
So let's read this article.

276
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,200
I don't play with female gamers, says Tyler Ninja Blevins, Twitch's biggest streamer and

277
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,660
one of the faces of the Fortnite fandom.

278
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,060
This edict may be surprising to hear, especially as emphatically as Blevins said it when we

279
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,200
spoke at a recent Samsung event.

280
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,040
If I have one conversation with one female streamer where we're playing with one another

281
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,520
and there's even a hint of flirting that is going to be taken and going to be put on every

282
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,920
single video and be clickbait forever.

283
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,320
You know, that, that is actually true.

284
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,320
I remember seeing two streamers, Eloise and Hafu, they're both Hearthstone streamers.

285
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,320
They're both Chinese women.

286
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,760
And they kind of played up the whole he, he were dating thing when they're not dating,

287
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,000
they're both straight.

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,920
But for a long time people were saying, Oh, they're lesbians together.

289
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,320
You know, Twitch likes to do that.

290
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,560
Fandoms like to do that.

291
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:07,680
So if he's happily married and he wants to just kind of keep things private like that,

292
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,280
keep his romantic life private, then yeah, you're going to avoid streaming with people

293
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,280
whom a fandom might start spreading the rumor that you guys are dating or something, or

294
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,880
that they might start shipping you, you know, they're going to, he's going to avoid that

295
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,760
and it's reasonable to do so.

296
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,540
Ninja said, not being connected to other women online.

297
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,800
That was something I made a hundred percent sure it was his decision alone to keep his

298
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,840
streaming partners men only.

299
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
That was not even her.

300
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
She had nothing to do with it.

301
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,000
That was me being, I love our relationship and no, I'm not going to put you through that.

302
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,280
A growing Twitch means a diminishing sense of privacy, especially for women on the platform.

303
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,000
Female streamers have opened up before about the difficulty in maintaining a separation

304
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,800
between their Twitch personas and who they are offline, often at the behest of viewers

305
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,080
who demand answers, lest they assume what's going on for themselves.

306
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,960
So this article is surprisingly from Polygon, a reasonably fair article.

307
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:02,080
And it is just about how Ninja doesn't stream with women because he's married.

308
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,040
He doesn't want the community to start spinning up rumors about him and how maybe that's a

309
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,800
bit discriminatory, but it's also reasonable on his end.

310
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,180
But then we get this tweet thread from our good friend, Nathan Grayson.

311
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:22,280
Now those of you who remember Nathan Grayson, he, he was one of the, uh, the five guys from

312
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,360
Gamergate, one of the guys who fucked Zoe Quinn.

313
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,740
And while he was fucking her, he was also reporting on a game jam she was involved in

314
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,200
and spinning her story in that report to be extremely positive when there's evidence that

315
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,680
it might not have been.

316
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,800
So that, that was the, the ethics and games journalism of Gamergate, by the way.

317
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,480
But here's his take on it.

318
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,760
Ninja's stance here is thorny as hell.

319
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,140
While I get where he's coming from, this lends credence to the idea that women are different

320
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,180
and should be treated as such.

321
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,460
Well, it's his own personal opinion.

322
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,120
Like I assume that if his wife had a problem with it, his wife would let him know.

323
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,680
I don't think it's your place to stick social justice into their fucking marriage.

324
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,820
Part of the reason this sort of thing happens is that Twitch is dominated by dudes who play

325
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,740
with other dudes.

326
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,340
Ninja is more visible than anybody and could do a lot to change that perception if he so

327
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,220
chose, but he'd have to really commit to it and he doesn't seem to care enough.

328
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,220
Well, his platform is not yours for you to promote your social ideas on, Nathan.

329
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,700
Ninja has no obligation to use his platform to push any kind of social change.

330
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,420
It's his show, not yours.

331
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,960
And this is the absolute worst thing about hegemonic social justice is that when you

332
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,220
build an independent platform, like Ninja has, or like, you know, in the whole comics

333
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,060
gate thing, when people started bypassing the SJWs in comics and they were, they started

334
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,460
directly crowdfunding the comics they wanted to see through Kickstarter or whatever, SJWs

335
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,500
become fucking livid.

336
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,140
They're like, Oh, you've, you've built a platform.

337
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,140
You're influential.

338
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,780
Well, now you have to push our politics.

339
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:06,120
Now you have a moral obligation to push our politics because we, we are the ones who understand

340
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,180
what morality is.

341
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,140
And that really is the problem with the larger left.

342
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,380
Like this is, this is obviously a story about video games basically, but it's a problem

343
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,420
with the larger left that the left believe that they have a moral high ground, which

344
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,680
they don't, but they believe they do.

345
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,400
And they believe that moral high ground should give them access to every, every section of

346
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,300
life, every large platform, every mode of influence.

347
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,700
They say, because we are right, because we're right.

348
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,720
We need to use every avenue to get our message out there.

349
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,220
And even if they were completely right, which they're obviously not, but even if they were

350
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,460
completely right, I don't think it follows.

351
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,320
I don't think it logically follows at all that therefore they have the right to platforms

352
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
they don't own.

353
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,500
Ninja has no obligation to push this guy's brand of idiotic politics.

354
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,740
And even if his politics were correct, he still has no obligation to push them.

355
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,580
All right, my friends, that does it for me.

356
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,460
I'm going to turn this video recording off and I'm immediately going to go record the

357
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,780
Alex Jones video.

358
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,620
I'm going to be in my, my little office here for, for quite a while.

359
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,140
I'll see you guys later.

360
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,640
I love you.
