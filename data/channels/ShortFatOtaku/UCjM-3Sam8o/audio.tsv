0	6460	Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly number 8 for the 12th of August 2018.
6460	8940	And as you can see, I've started on my desktop.
8940	13460	Well I've done that for a reason, and that reason is, I've been very public that the
13460	18120	next video I'm making is on Alex Jones, and I have the script right there along with my
18120	25600	social media research folder, however these six other scripts are all in various stages
25600	31640	of completion, so I figured we'll do a quick impromptu vote on which one you want to see
31640	32640	next.
32640	38760	We've got a script on cultural appropriation, a script on journalists are not a protected
38760	45180	class, a script on forced civility, a script on Anthony Burch, a script on the origin of
45180	50740	Islamophobia, and a script on Boogie2988.
50740	51740	So here's what we'll do.
51740	56820	The first person to comment that they want one of these six scripts, I will super like
56820	59080	that comment, and only that comment.
59080	63160	So hopefully those six comments will rise to the top, and then all you have to do is
63160	68100	simply thumbs up the topic that you want to see next, and after the Alex Jones video is
68100	73500	done, and presuming that nothing major happens in that time, the next video I do will be
73500	75960	one of these six, based on your votes.
75960	83500	And I actually got a lot of positive feedback last week from my coffee drinking during that
83500	93900	episode, so here guys, just take a listen.
93900	100020	This time, I'm drinking regular coffee, but instead of milk or cream, I'm using chocolate
100020	103620	milk in the coffee, and it's actually pretty fucking incredible.
103620	106640	Let's get to today's social justice nonsense.
106640	111920	Here we have Professor Slam's hegemonic masculinity of homeless men.
111920	117400	I mean look at this guy, isn't he just the spitting image of white male privilege?
117400	123400	A feminist professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada recently published a book chapter
123400	130120	documenting the myriad ways homeless men allegedly perpetuate hegemonic masculinity while discussing
130120	131880	their hardships.
131880	136300	Of course this would come from fucking Wilfrid Laurier, for those of you who don't know,
136300	142820	that was the school that raked Lindsay Shepard over the coals for playing in a neutral manner
142820	147340	not even agreeing with him a video of Jordan Peterson to her students.
147340	152560	The book chapter, When a Man's Home is Not a Castle, Hegemonic Masculinity Among Men
152560	158760	Experiencing Homelessness, was published last Wednesday by Professor Erin Dege in a book
158760	164400	she co-edited on patriarchy in psychiatric wards and homeless shelters.
164400	169400	I guess the fruit was just way too low hanging to go after people like Harvey Weinstein or
169400	175960	anybody else in the top, because if you wanted an example of hegemonic masculinity and of
175960	179520	white patriarchy, I mean you could just go there, you can go to Hollywood, you can go
179520	185580	to any kind of upper echelons of any society, and you'll probably find some kind of example
185580	186580	of that.
186580	192620	Maybe go for the homeless men, because even if you're homeless if you have a penis you're
192620	193620	oppressive.
193620	197740	The goal of her research, she explains, was to assess the ways hypermasculinity is performed
197740	203620	among men experiencing homelessness, and to do this she interviewed 27 homeless men and
203620	208620	spent an additional 296 hours spying on them in homeless shelters.
208620	214280	While research on vulnerable people typically requires informed consent and approval by
214280	218140	an ethics board, it is unclear if Dege sought this.
218140	219900	Imagine my shock!
219900	225940	She declined to comment on this when emailed by PJ Media, and her research makes no mention
225940	227080	of ethics review.
227080	231900	Of course it doesn't, because these people don't care about ethics.
231900	237500	To them, ethics is kind of a roadblock, it's something that's in the way.
237500	243060	Maybe ethics is part of the white patriarchy, if it's holding a female professor down it
243060	248520	has to be part of the white patriarchy, so maybe ethical standards is just doublespeak
248520	253200	for men trying to do her transformative research or whatever the fuck she's going to call it.
253200	257380	During interviews with homeless men, Dege claims she learned that many aspire to hegemonic
257380	262540	masculinity, which she defines as the type of masculinity that serves to fortify the
262540	266280	dominance of men and ultimately subordinate women.
266280	271240	Do you mean maybe that they aspire to not be homeless, or hold down a job, or own a
271240	275900	car, or a house, or have a girlfriend, or a wife, or kids?
275900	282560	Maybe being homeless has made them desire a generic, unremarkable white picket fence
282560	286800	life because that is just so much better than living on the fucking streets?
286800	292260	I wonder if this person would go so far as to say that just general desires to get a
292260	297880	girlfriend by the non-violent n-cells would be hegemonic masculinity.
297880	301280	If you're a lonely guy and you're like, man I wish I could have a girlfriend, I wish I
301280	307200	had somebody to love and cherish and share my life with, but I've just been completely
307200	309600	unlucky in love, that's hegemonic masculinity.
309600	310840	I bet that's how she thinks.
310840	314240	However, she finds that it's difficult for homeless men to achieve this.
314240	318440	Without the trappings of a successful life, such as a home or a career, many men instead
318440	323280	develop what Dege refers to as compensatory masculinity to cope with their failed status.
323280	330240	This type of masculinity is worse than hegemonic masculinity, though not as bad as toxic masculinity,
330240	335480	and it involves men emphasizing whatever hyper-masculine traits they can within their stratified social
335480	338620	status to the detriment, allegedly, of women.
338620	345040	This is what I said a few videos back in the Starbucks and Belligerents of Black Subculture
345040	346040	video.
346040	353080	This is the one I talked about how in the absence of money or social status or job or
353080	357680	ability to get ahead or property or anything like that, men will often resort to brute
357680	363040	force as a way to create a social status, and nine times out of ten the reason that
363040	366680	happens is because of perpetual fatherlessness.
366680	372720	And just so we're clear, who is it that constantly talks about the breakup of the nuclear family?
372720	374480	That would be radical feminists.
374600	379120	Throughout her paper, as she writes up her research findings, Dege ridicules these men
379120	384860	for everything from reinforcing gender stereotypes, to refusing to show emotion, to talking about
384860	388220	how their ex-wives stole money from them.
388220	392560	This person sounds like a heartless sociopath at this point.
392560	398800	I have a feeling that feminist academia at this point is just pumping out these heartless
398800	405380	sociopaths who see homeless men, men who are quite literally at the bottom of the social
405380	409420	strata and just shit on them, just because they can.
409420	414600	For example, Julian, a homeless 45 year old man with severe anxiety, was accused by Dege
414600	419360	of perpetuating stereotypes when he confessed that I'm ashamed that I have problems, like
419360	421800	guys in our society are not supposed to have problems.
421800	427960	Oh look, it's actually Dege playing her part in perpetuating this toxic masculinity that
427960	433240	she rails against because I assume she was sitting there with a fucking white male tears
433240	436120	mug sipping on it as she was listening to this guy's story.
436120	440920	Dege also interviewed Ron, a 41 year old homeless man with depression and PTSD.
440920	445260	Ron used various drugs to cope with his mental health issues and by age 41, this had taken
445260	448720	a heavy toll on him, causing breathing problems and muscle weakness.
448720	452480	I walked down the street and like a little girl could have killed me.
452480	456160	That's how weak I was, Ron told Dege during an interview.
456160	461120	Strapolating from this comment, Dege then suggested that Ron somehow views women and
461120	462840	mass negatively.
462840	469120	That is the height of conceit that you're going to take this guy's terrible life story
469120	471260	and turn it around to be something about yourself.
471260	475900	For Ron, the feminine subjectively acts as the ultimate exemplar of physical weakness
475900	481560	and the most absurd hyperbole of who constitutes a threat, Dege wrote in her essay.
481560	504880	Not surprisingly, Dege writes that the only alternative for these men is to become more
504880	511400	emotional insofar as men should comfort, display, and work through their emotions, adding to
511400	514540	the complexity of what it means to be masculine.
514540	518120	But even men who are open about their emotions are problematic.
518120	522700	If a man opens up about his emotions, Dege laments that it still allows masculinity to
522700	527340	prevail without necessarily challenging the patriarchal foundation upon which it rests
527340	529320	â€“ catch 22.
529320	535660	So basically, there's no winning, all men are toxic and evil, especially homeless men,
535660	539840	and this person is a complete fucking moral leper, which has also been awarded at least
539840	543460	$195,000 by the Canadian government to research this shit.
543460	544560	This is fucking ridiculous.
544560	549000	But let's keep going down the rabbit hole of ridiculousness with, new research shows
549000	553400	a vast majority of cis people won't date trans people.
553400	558540	A recent study attempts to quantify the extent of trans discrimination when it comes to romantic
558540	560080	and sexual relationships.
560080	565140	See, when I was younger I was always told to just say no if you didn't like the way
565140	569860	someone was coming on to you, but I guess nowadays your sexual preferences are considered
569860	572080	discriminatory.
572080	575140	Considering the discrimination that trans people face on a daily basis, it comes as
575140	579040	no surprise that trans people are overlooked when it comes to dating.
579040	584060	Two Canadian researchers recently asked almost 1000 cisgender folks if they would date a
584060	590700	trans person in a new study, holy shit this article is actually written like an SJW who's
590700	591700	tweeting.
591700	598260	About 150 participants, all but 7 cisgender, ranging in age from 18 to 81, were asked to
598260	600800	indicate which genders they would consider dating.
600800	605660	The options included cisgender man, cisgender woman, trans man, trans woman, or gender queer,
605660	608500	and participants could select as many genders as they wanted.
608500	613820	Only 12% of all participants selected trans woman and or trans man.
613820	618140	That is normal isn't it, I mean, what is the percentage of society that is actually
618140	619140	gay?
619140	622180	Isn't it around like 8% or 12% or something like that?
622180	624300	That actually seems in line.
624300	630180	You are not going to turn a society 100% bisexual, it is never going to be much higher than that.
630180	634580	Those who would consider dating a trans person didn't differ in race or ethnicity, but
634580	639060	were somewhat older, more likely to hold a university degree, and unsurprisingly, less
639060	642540	likely to be religious than those who would not date a trans person.
642540	645780	But some of the most striking differences were in regards to participants' gender
645780	648080	and sexual orientation.
648080	654120	Basically all heterosexuals excluded trans folks from their dating pool, that is in fact
654120	657100	the definition of heterosexual.
657100	662880	Only 1.8% of straight women and 3.3% of straight men chose a trans person of either binary
662880	663880	gender.
663880	668560	But most non-heterosexuals weren't down for dating a trans person either, with only
668560	675060	11.5% of gay men and 29% of lesbians being trans inclusive in their dating preferences.
675060	681940	Well that's because, one, I forget the exact terminology, Blair White used it, it was a
681940	688660	long psychological term, but attraction to a trans person is its own sexuality outside
688660	690740	of gay, straight, or bi.
690740	696200	Secondly, and this is the more ridiculous explanation, if you actually believe in there
696200	702460	being more than two genders, well then if straight people are only attracted to a specific
702460	708080	gender and gay people are only attracted to a specific gender, well if trans people
708080	715340	are a different third gender or an 8th gender or a 1200th gender, gay or straight wouldn't
715340	716540	encompass that.
716540	721140	Bisexual, queer, and non-binary participants, they were all combined into one group, were
721140	725620	most open to having a trans partner, but even among them almost half did not select either
725620	728160	trans man or trans woman.
728160	732760	I can only assume that those three groups were all combined into one group, because
732760	736860	there aren't really that many of them, even in a pool of a thousand people.
736860	740200	This is the kind of minority we're talking about here.
740200	746460	And when SJWs want to bend a society, this is Canada, a society of 36 million people
746460	752220	to what statistically rounds out to be what, like a couple thousand?
752220	754380	It's ridiculous, it's ridiculous.
754380	758180	Specific relationships are one of the most important sources of social support for adults.
758180	762640	The fact that most cis people would not consider trans people as potential dating partners
762640	767660	is yet another serious risk factor for increased psychological and physical health problems
767660	769900	among the trans population.
769900	777840	Well, while that's true, and while that sucks, the ability for cis people, and really, all
777840	782600	people, to date who they want to date, and to be attracted to who they want to be attracted
782600	785760	to, trumps any of that.
785760	789680	You're not going to go to a cis person at gunpoint and say you must date this trans
789680	791300	person for the good of the trans person.
791300	792480	It's not going to happen.
792480	798000	The high rates of trans exclusion for potential dating pools are undoubtedly due in part to
798000	801680	cis normativity, cis sexism, and transphobia.
801680	807680	How about it's because you don't find them attractive and that's not transphobia?
807680	813880	You can still not be a transphobe and still be like, yeah, but I don't find you attractive.
813880	816600	Does it work with gay people too?
816600	819800	If you're straight and a gay person hits on you and you're like, listen, I have nothing
819800	822840	against gay people, I'm just not interested, does that make you a homophobe?
822840	826260	It's also possible that at least some of the trans exclusion is due to the fact that for
826260	831680	some people, sexual orientation might be not just about a partner's gender identity, but
831680	836260	attraction to specific body types and or judgment of reproductive capabilities.
836260	840700	This is where the whole feminine B-ness comes in, isn't it?
840700	844820	These results clearly indicate that although the visibility of transgender people is on
844820	850220	the rise, we still have a long way to go to reach trans equality.
850220	852620	Trans equality means rights.
852620	855100	That's what it means.
855100	858060	It does not mean that everyone needs to be attracted to you.
858060	860920	It does not mean that everyone's going to like you.
860920	862300	It means rights.
862300	865400	It means it means legal rights.
865400	867500	It means human rights.
867500	871560	It does not mean that you walk down the street and everyone thinks that you're a fucking
871560	872560	bombshell.
872560	875240	That's not how the world works and it's never going to get there.
875240	880200	And in fact, let's watch some of these oppressions clash against one another.
880200	887120	Transgender model called Muslim airport worker, terrorist in two hour meltdown after she misheard
887120	890960	ma'am for man.
890960	895000	So guys, who's more oppressed?
895000	897760	Who's more oppressed and who's more oppressive?
897760	904620	Is it the transgender model who called a Muslim a terrorist or the Muslim airport worker who
904620	908120	could have called a transgender model a man?
908120	912200	I mean, I know that he said ma'am, but let's just say for the sake of argument, which one
912200	916360	of those two is more oppressed and which one of those two is more oppressive?
916360	920760	A transgender model called a Muslim airport security staffer a terrorist after she mistakenly
920760	922720	heard them call her a man.
922720	925380	The security worker had actually said ma'am.
925380	930760	Francesca Camica, 23, shouted the comments during a two hour meltdown at London's Heathrow
930760	935000	airport while traveling to Italy for a breast augmentation.
935000	938880	Camica also got in the face of one officer and shouted, this guy hates transgenders and
938880	940000	wishes me dead.
940000	941000	You're the terrorist.
941000	945560	Camica, who was identified as female on both her British and Italian passports, told the
945560	949440	court, when someone calls me man, I feel so desolated.
949440	954480	She was convicted of using threatening behavior towards Mustafa Abbas and supervisor Fahad
954480	959160	Arshad on September 17th and was conditionally discharged for two years.
959160	964800	She was ordered to pay each victim 50 pounds compensation and 750 pounds costs.
964800	969040	Mr. Abbas insisted that he addressed Camica as ma'am during secondary security checks
969040	971240	and busy terminal four.
971240	973780	That's when the abuse began, he told the trial.
973780	976320	She said, don't talk to me like a dog.
976320	979040	You need to learn some education, you fucking idiot.
979040	982280	She said it with disgust and was looking down at me and made me feel worthless like
982280	984460	I am nothing as if I am a peasant.
984460	987660	She said, you earn six pounds an hour and you think you are God.
987660	991800	He reported the incident to supervisor Mr. Arshad, who told the court, she refused to
991800	996720	stop and completely lost control, just mad I couldn't speak to her.
996720	1000600	She completely lost the plot saying that she was transgender and that I wished death on
1000600	1002040	all transgenders.
1002040	1004040	She was in a blind rage.
1004040	1008380	I mean, considering considering the state of Islam right now, it's not an unreasonable
1008380	1013740	thing to jump to conclusion to, but of course she was still acting ridiculously.
1013740	1016980	She pointed at my beard and said, I should be afraid of you.
1016980	1018360	You are the terrorist.
1018360	1024060	She said I was homosexual and made an oral sex gesture with her hand.
1024060	1029260	I have never come across anyone that angry or unpredictable in seven years at Heathrow.
1029260	1033600	I felt intimidated when she came close to my face and poked my shoulder with her fingers.
1033600	1039560	She said, you're peasants, I'll buy this fucking airport, this fucking plane.
1039560	1043840	To be called a terrorist because of how I look is disgusting and she lost control with
1043840	1046260	the police as well.
1046260	1051120	You think that she would understand that if she was somebody who was called a man because
1051120	1057560	of how she looks and she felt disgusted by it as she should, then maybe she should also
1057560	1062820	understand that to call a brown guy with a beard a terrorist because of how he looks
1062820	1064280	is equally disgusting.
1064280	1069100	The court heard Kamika also shouted, I've been a woman for 20 years.
1069100	1074580	So you, you had the surgery when you were three years old to call me, sir is a crime.
1074580	1076920	I've got a diplomatic passport.
1076920	1078140	You can't do anything to me.
1078140	1079140	I know my rights.
1079140	1082820	Kamika, who has a PhD in law was upset.
1082820	1085760	There was no Jewish Torah on which to swear an oath.
1085760	1087020	She told the court it's okay.
1087020	1089400	My rates are breached every day.
1089400	1091180	What a fucking snowflake.
1091180	1096340	But let's switch back to a biological CIS woman for a bit.
1096340	1097340	Here's polygon.
1097340	1098340	Oh yeah.
1098340	1100300	Where did your ads go?
1100300	1102500	I blocked them.
1102500	1106900	Ninja explains his choice not to stream with female gamers.
1106900	1109760	The only way to avoid the rumors is to not play with them at all.
1109760	1114060	Now for those of you who don't know, Ninja is the biggest streamer on Twitch right now.
1114060	1119600	He streams mostly Fortnite, I think it's almost almost completely Fortnite.
1119600	1123520	And he makes something like a quarter million dollars a month on Twitch.
1123520	1126800	He has, I think it's in the six digits regularly whenever he streams.
1126800	1132520	Like he is the biggest guy on Twitch right now.
1132520	1137520	And I want, I want it to be known before we read this article that he's married.
1137520	1138520	All right.
1138520	1143560	I don't think his wife streams with him, but he's married.
1143560	1145400	He's monogamous.
1145400	1149160	And that's, I guess he, I guess he, that's how he wants to keep things.
1149160	1151440	So let's read this article.
1151440	1156200	I don't play with female gamers, says Tyler Ninja Blevins, Twitch's biggest streamer and
1156200	1158660	one of the faces of the Fortnite fandom.
1158660	1163060	This edict may be surprising to hear, especially as emphatically as Blevins said it when we
1163060	1165200	spoke at a recent Samsung event.
1165200	1169040	If I have one conversation with one female streamer where we're playing with one another
1169040	1173520	and there's even a hint of flirting that is going to be taken and going to be put on every
1173520	1175920	single video and be clickbait forever.
1175920	1177320	You know, that, that is actually true.
1177320	1182320	I remember seeing two streamers, Eloise and Hafu, they're both Hearthstone streamers.
1182320	1186320	They're both Chinese women.
1186320	1190760	And they kind of played up the whole he, he were dating thing when they're not dating,
1190760	1192000	they're both straight.
1192000	1194920	But for a long time people were saying, Oh, they're lesbians together.
1194920	1197320	You know, Twitch likes to do that.
1197320	1198560	Fandoms like to do that.
1198560	1207680	So if he's happily married and he wants to just kind of keep things private like that,
1207680	1211280	keep his romantic life private, then yeah, you're going to avoid streaming with people
1211280	1216280	whom a fandom might start spreading the rumor that you guys are dating or something, or
1216280	1219880	that they might start shipping you, you know, they're going to, he's going to avoid that
1219880	1221760	and it's reasonable to do so.
1221760	1224540	Ninja said, not being connected to other women online.
1224540	1227800	That was something I made a hundred percent sure it was his decision alone to keep his
1227800	1229840	streaming partners men only.
1229840	1230840	That was not even her.
1230840	1231840	She had nothing to do with it.
1231840	1236000	That was me being, I love our relationship and no, I'm not going to put you through that.
1236000	1240280	A growing Twitch means a diminishing sense of privacy, especially for women on the platform.
1240280	1243000	Female streamers have opened up before about the difficulty in maintaining a separation
1243000	1247800	between their Twitch personas and who they are offline, often at the behest of viewers
1247800	1251080	who demand answers, lest they assume what's going on for themselves.
1251080	1255960	So this article is surprisingly from Polygon, a reasonably fair article.
1255960	1262080	And it is just about how Ninja doesn't stream with women because he's married.
1262080	1267040	He doesn't want the community to start spinning up rumors about him and how maybe that's a
1267040	1269800	bit discriminatory, but it's also reasonable on his end.
1269800	1276180	But then we get this tweet thread from our good friend, Nathan Grayson.
1276180	1282280	Now those of you who remember Nathan Grayson, he, he was one of the, uh, the five guys from
1282280	1285360	Gamergate, one of the guys who fucked Zoe Quinn.
1285360	1290740	And while he was fucking her, he was also reporting on a game jam she was involved in
1290740	1295200	and spinning her story in that report to be extremely positive when there's evidence that
1295200	1296680	it might not have been.
1296680	1301800	So that, that was the, the ethics and games journalism of Gamergate, by the way.
1301800	1303480	But here's his take on it.
1303480	1305760	Ninja's stance here is thorny as hell.
1305760	1310140	While I get where he's coming from, this lends credence to the idea that women are different
1310140	1312180	and should be treated as such.
1312180	1314460	Well, it's his own personal opinion.
1314460	1319120	Like I assume that if his wife had a problem with it, his wife would let him know.
1319120	1323680	I don't think it's your place to stick social justice into their fucking marriage.
1323680	1327820	Part of the reason this sort of thing happens is that Twitch is dominated by dudes who play
1327820	1329740	with other dudes.
1329740	1333340	Ninja is more visible than anybody and could do a lot to change that perception if he so
1333340	1338220	chose, but he'd have to really commit to it and he doesn't seem to care enough.
1338220	1344220	Well, his platform is not yours for you to promote your social ideas on, Nathan.
1344220	1349700	Ninja has no obligation to use his platform to push any kind of social change.
1349700	1351420	It's his show, not yours.
1351420	1356960	And this is the absolute worst thing about hegemonic social justice is that when you
1356960	1362220	build an independent platform, like Ninja has, or like, you know, in the whole comics
1362220	1367060	gate thing, when people started bypassing the SJWs in comics and they were, they started
1367060	1372460	directly crowdfunding the comics they wanted to see through Kickstarter or whatever, SJWs
1372460	1374500	become fucking livid.
1374500	1377140	They're like, Oh, you've, you've built a platform.
1377140	1378140	You're influential.
1378140	1379780	Well, now you have to push our politics.
1379780	1386120	Now you have a moral obligation to push our politics because we, we are the ones who understand
1386120	1388180	what morality is.
1388180	1391140	And that really is the problem with the larger left.
1391140	1395380	Like this is, this is obviously a story about video games basically, but it's a problem
1395380	1399420	with the larger left that the left believe that they have a moral high ground, which
1399420	1401680	they don't, but they believe they do.
1401680	1408400	And they believe that moral high ground should give them access to every, every section of
1408400	1412300	life, every large platform, every mode of influence.
1412300	1415700	They say, because we are right, because we're right.
1415700	1418720	We need to use every avenue to get our message out there.
1418720	1422220	And even if they were completely right, which they're obviously not, but even if they were
1422220	1425460	completely right, I don't think it follows.
1425460	1430320	I don't think it logically follows at all that therefore they have the right to platforms
1430320	1431320	they don't own.
1431320	1435500	Ninja has no obligation to push this guy's brand of idiotic politics.
1435500	1439740	And even if his politics were correct, he still has no obligation to push them.
1439740	1441580	All right, my friends, that does it for me.
1441580	1446460	I'm going to turn this video recording off and I'm immediately going to go record the
1446460	1447780	Alex Jones video.
1447780	1451620	I'm going to be in my, my little office here for, for quite a while.
1451660	1453140	I'll see you guys later.
1453140	1453640	I love you.
