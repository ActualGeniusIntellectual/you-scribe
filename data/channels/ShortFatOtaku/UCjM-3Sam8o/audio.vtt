00:00.000 --> 00:06.460
Hello my friends, welcome to SJ Weekly number 8 for the 12th of August 2018.

00:06.460 --> 00:08.940
And as you can see, I've started on my desktop.

00:08.940 --> 00:13.460
Well I've done that for a reason, and that reason is, I've been very public that the

00:13.460 --> 00:18.120
next video I'm making is on Alex Jones, and I have the script right there along with my

00:18.120 --> 00:25.600
social media research folder, however these six other scripts are all in various stages

00:25.600 --> 00:31.640
of completion, so I figured we'll do a quick impromptu vote on which one you want to see

00:31.640 --> 00:32.640
next.

00:32.640 --> 00:38.760
We've got a script on cultural appropriation, a script on journalists are not a protected

00:38.760 --> 00:45.180
class, a script on forced civility, a script on Anthony Burch, a script on the origin of

00:45.180 --> 00:50.740
Islamophobia, and a script on Boogie2988.

00:50.740 --> 00:51.740
So here's what we'll do.

00:51.740 --> 00:56.820
The first person to comment that they want one of these six scripts, I will super like

00:56.820 --> 00:59.080
that comment, and only that comment.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.160
So hopefully those six comments will rise to the top, and then all you have to do is

01:03.160 --> 01:08.100
simply thumbs up the topic that you want to see next, and after the Alex Jones video is

01:08.100 --> 01:13.500
done, and presuming that nothing major happens in that time, the next video I do will be

01:13.500 --> 01:15.960
one of these six, based on your votes.

01:15.960 --> 01:23.500
And I actually got a lot of positive feedback last week from my coffee drinking during that

01:23.500 --> 01:33.900
episode, so here guys, just take a listen.

01:33.900 --> 01:40.020
This time, I'm drinking regular coffee, but instead of milk or cream, I'm using chocolate

01:40.020 --> 01:43.620
milk in the coffee, and it's actually pretty fucking incredible.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.640
Let's get to today's social justice nonsense.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.920
Here we have Professor Slam's hegemonic masculinity of homeless men.

01:51.920 --> 01:57.400
I mean look at this guy, isn't he just the spitting image of white male privilege?

01:57.400 --> 02:03.400
A feminist professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada recently published a book chapter

02:03.400 --> 02:10.120
documenting the myriad ways homeless men allegedly perpetuate hegemonic masculinity while discussing

02:10.120 --> 02:11.880
their hardships.

02:11.880 --> 02:16.300
Of course this would come from fucking Wilfrid Laurier, for those of you who don't know,

02:16.300 --> 02:22.820
that was the school that raked Lindsay Shepard over the coals for playing in a neutral manner

02:22.820 --> 02:27.340
not even agreeing with him a video of Jordan Peterson to her students.

02:27.340 --> 02:32.560
The book chapter, When a Man's Home is Not a Castle, Hegemonic Masculinity Among Men

02:32.560 --> 02:38.760
Experiencing Homelessness, was published last Wednesday by Professor Erin Dege in a book

02:38.760 --> 02:44.400
she co-edited on patriarchy in psychiatric wards and homeless shelters.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.400
I guess the fruit was just way too low hanging to go after people like Harvey Weinstein or

02:49.400 --> 02:55.960
anybody else in the top, because if you wanted an example of hegemonic masculinity and of

02:55.960 --> 02:59.520
white patriarchy, I mean you could just go there, you can go to Hollywood, you can go

02:59.520 --> 03:05.580
to any kind of upper echelons of any society, and you'll probably find some kind of example

03:05.580 --> 03:06.580
of that.

03:06.580 --> 03:12.620
Maybe go for the homeless men, because even if you're homeless if you have a penis you're

03:12.620 --> 03:13.620
oppressive.

03:13.620 --> 03:17.740
The goal of her research, she explains, was to assess the ways hypermasculinity is performed

03:17.740 --> 03:23.620
among men experiencing homelessness, and to do this she interviewed 27 homeless men and

03:23.620 --> 03:28.620
spent an additional 296 hours spying on them in homeless shelters.

03:28.620 --> 03:34.280
While research on vulnerable people typically requires informed consent and approval by

03:34.280 --> 03:38.140
an ethics board, it is unclear if Dege sought this.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.900
Imagine my shock!

03:39.900 --> 03:45.940
She declined to comment on this when emailed by PJ Media, and her research makes no mention

03:45.940 --> 03:47.080
of ethics review.

03:47.080 --> 03:51.900
Of course it doesn't, because these people don't care about ethics.

03:51.900 --> 03:57.500
To them, ethics is kind of a roadblock, it's something that's in the way.

03:57.500 --> 04:03.060
Maybe ethics is part of the white patriarchy, if it's holding a female professor down it

04:03.060 --> 04:08.520
has to be part of the white patriarchy, so maybe ethical standards is just doublespeak

04:08.520 --> 04:13.200
for men trying to do her transformative research or whatever the fuck she's going to call it.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.380
During interviews with homeless men, Dege claims she learned that many aspire to hegemonic

04:17.380 --> 04:22.540
masculinity, which she defines as the type of masculinity that serves to fortify the

04:22.540 --> 04:26.280
dominance of men and ultimately subordinate women.

04:26.280 --> 04:31.240
Do you mean maybe that they aspire to not be homeless, or hold down a job, or own a

04:31.240 --> 04:35.900
car, or a house, or have a girlfriend, or a wife, or kids?

04:35.900 --> 04:42.560
Maybe being homeless has made them desire a generic, unremarkable white picket fence

04:42.560 --> 04:46.800
life because that is just so much better than living on the fucking streets?

04:46.800 --> 04:52.260
I wonder if this person would go so far as to say that just general desires to get a

04:52.260 --> 04:57.880
girlfriend by the non-violent n-cells would be hegemonic masculinity.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.280
If you're a lonely guy and you're like, man I wish I could have a girlfriend, I wish I

05:01.280 --> 05:07.200
had somebody to love and cherish and share my life with, but I've just been completely

05:07.200 --> 05:09.600
unlucky in love, that's hegemonic masculinity.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.840
I bet that's how she thinks.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.240
However, she finds that it's difficult for homeless men to achieve this.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.440
Without the trappings of a successful life, such as a home or a career, many men instead

05:18.440 --> 05:23.280
develop what Dege refers to as compensatory masculinity to cope with their failed status.

05:23.280 --> 05:30.240
This type of masculinity is worse than hegemonic masculinity, though not as bad as toxic masculinity,

05:30.240 --> 05:35.480
and it involves men emphasizing whatever hyper-masculine traits they can within their stratified social

05:35.480 --> 05:38.620
status to the detriment, allegedly, of women.

05:38.620 --> 05:45.040
This is what I said a few videos back in the Starbucks and Belligerents of Black Subculture

05:45.040 --> 05:46.040
video.

05:46.040 --> 05:53.080
This is the one I talked about how in the absence of money or social status or job or

05:53.080 --> 05:57.680
ability to get ahead or property or anything like that, men will often resort to brute

05:57.680 --> 06:03.040
force as a way to create a social status, and nine times out of ten the reason that

06:03.040 --> 06:06.680
happens is because of perpetual fatherlessness.

06:06.680 --> 06:12.720
And just so we're clear, who is it that constantly talks about the breakup of the nuclear family?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.480
That would be radical feminists.

06:14.600 --> 06:19.120
Throughout her paper, as she writes up her research findings, Dege ridicules these men

06:19.120 --> 06:24.860
for everything from reinforcing gender stereotypes, to refusing to show emotion, to talking about

06:24.860 --> 06:28.220
how their ex-wives stole money from them.

06:28.220 --> 06:32.560
This person sounds like a heartless sociopath at this point.

06:32.560 --> 06:38.800
I have a feeling that feminist academia at this point is just pumping out these heartless

06:38.800 --> 06:45.380
sociopaths who see homeless men, men who are quite literally at the bottom of the social

06:45.380 --> 06:49.420
strata and just shit on them, just because they can.

06:49.420 --> 06:54.600
For example, Julian, a homeless 45 year old man with severe anxiety, was accused by Dege

06:54.600 --> 06:59.360
of perpetuating stereotypes when he confessed that I'm ashamed that I have problems, like

06:59.360 --> 07:01.800
guys in our society are not supposed to have problems.

07:01.800 --> 07:07.960
Oh look, it's actually Dege playing her part in perpetuating this toxic masculinity that

07:07.960 --> 07:13.240
she rails against because I assume she was sitting there with a fucking white male tears

07:13.240 --> 07:16.120
mug sipping on it as she was listening to this guy's story.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.920
Dege also interviewed Ron, a 41 year old homeless man with depression and PTSD.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.260
Ron used various drugs to cope with his mental health issues and by age 41, this had taken

07:25.260 --> 07:28.720
a heavy toll on him, causing breathing problems and muscle weakness.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.480
I walked down the street and like a little girl could have killed me.

07:32.480 --> 07:36.160
That's how weak I was, Ron told Dege during an interview.

07:36.160 --> 07:41.120
Strapolating from this comment, Dege then suggested that Ron somehow views women and

07:41.120 --> 07:42.840
mass negatively.

07:42.840 --> 07:49.120
That is the height of conceit that you're going to take this guy's terrible life story

07:49.120 --> 07:51.260
and turn it around to be something about yourself.

07:51.260 --> 07:55.900
For Ron, the feminine subjectively acts as the ultimate exemplar of physical weakness

07:55.900 --> 08:01.560
and the most absurd hyperbole of who constitutes a threat, Dege wrote in her essay.

08:01.560 --> 08:24.880
Not surprisingly, Dege writes that the only alternative for these men is to become more

08:24.880 --> 08:31.400
emotional insofar as men should comfort, display, and work through their emotions, adding to

08:31.400 --> 08:34.540
the complexity of what it means to be masculine.

08:34.540 --> 08:38.120
But even men who are open about their emotions are problematic.

08:38.120 --> 08:42.700
If a man opens up about his emotions, Dege laments that it still allows masculinity to

08:42.700 --> 08:47.340
prevail without necessarily challenging the patriarchal foundation upon which it rests

08:47.340 --> 08:49.320
– catch 22.

08:49.320 --> 08:55.660
So basically, there's no winning, all men are toxic and evil, especially homeless men,

08:55.660 --> 08:59.840
and this person is a complete fucking moral leper, which has also been awarded at least

08:59.840 --> 09:03.460
$195,000 by the Canadian government to research this shit.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.560
This is fucking ridiculous.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.000
But let's keep going down the rabbit hole of ridiculousness with, new research shows

09:09.000 --> 09:13.400
a vast majority of cis people won't date trans people.

09:13.400 --> 09:18.540
A recent study attempts to quantify the extent of trans discrimination when it comes to romantic

09:18.540 --> 09:20.080
and sexual relationships.

09:20.080 --> 09:25.140
See, when I was younger I was always told to just say no if you didn't like the way

09:25.140 --> 09:29.860
someone was coming on to you, but I guess nowadays your sexual preferences are considered

09:29.860 --> 09:32.080
discriminatory.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.140
Considering the discrimination that trans people face on a daily basis, it comes as

09:35.140 --> 09:39.040
no surprise that trans people are overlooked when it comes to dating.

09:39.040 --> 09:44.060
Two Canadian researchers recently asked almost 1000 cisgender folks if they would date a

09:44.060 --> 09:50.700
trans person in a new study, holy shit this article is actually written like an SJW who's

09:50.700 --> 09:51.700
tweeting.

09:51.700 --> 09:58.260
About 150 participants, all but 7 cisgender, ranging in age from 18 to 81, were asked to

09:58.260 --> 10:00.800
indicate which genders they would consider dating.

10:00.800 --> 10:05.660
The options included cisgender man, cisgender woman, trans man, trans woman, or gender queer,

10:05.660 --> 10:08.500
and participants could select as many genders as they wanted.

10:08.500 --> 10:13.820
Only 12% of all participants selected trans woman and or trans man.

10:13.820 --> 10:18.140
That is normal isn't it, I mean, what is the percentage of society that is actually

10:18.140 --> 10:19.140
gay?

10:19.140 --> 10:22.180
Isn't it around like 8% or 12% or something like that?

10:22.180 --> 10:24.300
That actually seems in line.

10:24.300 --> 10:30.180
You are not going to turn a society 100% bisexual, it is never going to be much higher than that.

10:30.180 --> 10:34.580
Those who would consider dating a trans person didn't differ in race or ethnicity, but

10:34.580 --> 10:39.060
were somewhat older, more likely to hold a university degree, and unsurprisingly, less

10:39.060 --> 10:42.540
likely to be religious than those who would not date a trans person.

10:42.540 --> 10:45.780
But some of the most striking differences were in regards to participants' gender

10:45.780 --> 10:48.080
and sexual orientation.

10:48.080 --> 10:54.120
Basically all heterosexuals excluded trans folks from their dating pool, that is in fact

10:54.120 --> 10:57.100
the definition of heterosexual.

10:57.100 --> 11:02.880
Only 1.8% of straight women and 3.3% of straight men chose a trans person of either binary

11:02.880 --> 11:03.880
gender.

11:03.880 --> 11:08.560
But most non-heterosexuals weren't down for dating a trans person either, with only

11:08.560 --> 11:15.060
11.5% of gay men and 29% of lesbians being trans inclusive in their dating preferences.

11:15.060 --> 11:21.940
Well that's because, one, I forget the exact terminology, Blair White used it, it was a

11:21.940 --> 11:28.660
long psychological term, but attraction to a trans person is its own sexuality outside

11:28.660 --> 11:30.740
of gay, straight, or bi.

11:30.740 --> 11:36.200
Secondly, and this is the more ridiculous explanation, if you actually believe in there

11:36.200 --> 11:42.460
being more than two genders, well then if straight people are only attracted to a specific

11:42.460 --> 11:48.080
gender and gay people are only attracted to a specific gender, well if trans people

11:48.080 --> 11:55.340
are a different third gender or an 8th gender or a 1200th gender, gay or straight wouldn't

11:55.340 --> 11:56.540
encompass that.

11:56.540 --> 12:01.140
Bisexual, queer, and non-binary participants, they were all combined into one group, were

12:01.140 --> 12:05.620
most open to having a trans partner, but even among them almost half did not select either

12:05.620 --> 12:08.160
trans man or trans woman.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.760
I can only assume that those three groups were all combined into one group, because

12:12.760 --> 12:16.860
there aren't really that many of them, even in a pool of a thousand people.

12:16.860 --> 12:20.200
This is the kind of minority we're talking about here.

12:20.200 --> 12:26.460
And when SJWs want to bend a society, this is Canada, a society of 36 million people

12:26.460 --> 12:32.220
to what statistically rounds out to be what, like a couple thousand?

12:32.220 --> 12:34.380
It's ridiculous, it's ridiculous.

12:34.380 --> 12:38.180
Specific relationships are one of the most important sources of social support for adults.

12:38.180 --> 12:42.640
The fact that most cis people would not consider trans people as potential dating partners

12:42.640 --> 12:47.660
is yet another serious risk factor for increased psychological and physical health problems

12:47.660 --> 12:49.900
among the trans population.

12:49.900 --> 12:57.840
Well, while that's true, and while that sucks, the ability for cis people, and really, all

12:57.840 --> 13:02.600
people, to date who they want to date, and to be attracted to who they want to be attracted

13:02.600 --> 13:05.760
to, trumps any of that.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.680
You're not going to go to a cis person at gunpoint and say you must date this trans

13:09.680 --> 13:11.300
person for the good of the trans person.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.480
It's not going to happen.

13:12.480 --> 13:18.000
The high rates of trans exclusion for potential dating pools are undoubtedly due in part to

13:18.000 --> 13:21.680
cis normativity, cis sexism, and transphobia.

13:21.680 --> 13:27.680
How about it's because you don't find them attractive and that's not transphobia?

13:27.680 --> 13:33.880
You can still not be a transphobe and still be like, yeah, but I don't find you attractive.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.600
Does it work with gay people too?

13:36.600 --> 13:39.800
If you're straight and a gay person hits on you and you're like, listen, I have nothing

13:39.800 --> 13:42.840
against gay people, I'm just not interested, does that make you a homophobe?

13:42.840 --> 13:46.260
It's also possible that at least some of the trans exclusion is due to the fact that for

13:46.260 --> 13:51.680
some people, sexual orientation might be not just about a partner's gender identity, but

13:51.680 --> 13:56.260
attraction to specific body types and or judgment of reproductive capabilities.

13:56.260 --> 14:00.700
This is where the whole feminine B-ness comes in, isn't it?

14:00.700 --> 14:04.820
These results clearly indicate that although the visibility of transgender people is on

14:04.820 --> 14:10.220
the rise, we still have a long way to go to reach trans equality.

14:10.220 --> 14:12.620
Trans equality means rights.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.100
That's what it means.

14:15.100 --> 14:18.060
It does not mean that everyone needs to be attracted to you.

14:18.060 --> 14:20.920
It does not mean that everyone's going to like you.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.300
It means rights.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.400
It means it means legal rights.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.500
It means human rights.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.560
It does not mean that you walk down the street and everyone thinks that you're a fucking

14:31.560 --> 14:32.560
bombshell.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.240
That's not how the world works and it's never going to get there.

14:35.240 --> 14:40.200
And in fact, let's watch some of these oppressions clash against one another.

14:40.200 --> 14:47.120
Transgender model called Muslim airport worker, terrorist in two hour meltdown after she misheard

14:47.120 --> 14:50.960
ma'am for man.

14:50.960 --> 14:55.000
So guys, who's more oppressed?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.760
Who's more oppressed and who's more oppressive?

14:57.760 --> 15:04.620
Is it the transgender model who called a Muslim a terrorist or the Muslim airport worker who

15:04.620 --> 15:08.120
could have called a transgender model a man?

15:08.120 --> 15:12.200
I mean, I know that he said ma'am, but let's just say for the sake of argument, which one

15:12.200 --> 15:16.360
of those two is more oppressed and which one of those two is more oppressive?

15:16.360 --> 15:20.760
A transgender model called a Muslim airport security staffer a terrorist after she mistakenly

15:20.760 --> 15:22.720
heard them call her a man.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.380
The security worker had actually said ma'am.

15:25.380 --> 15:30.760
Francesca Camica, 23, shouted the comments during a two hour meltdown at London's Heathrow

15:30.760 --> 15:35.000
airport while traveling to Italy for a breast augmentation.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.880
Camica also got in the face of one officer and shouted, this guy hates transgenders and

15:38.880 --> 15:40.000
wishes me dead.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
You're the terrorist.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.560
Camica, who was identified as female on both her British and Italian passports, told the

15:45.560 --> 15:49.440
court, when someone calls me man, I feel so desolated.

15:49.440 --> 15:54.480
She was convicted of using threatening behavior towards Mustafa Abbas and supervisor Fahad

15:54.480 --> 15:59.160
Arshad on September 17th and was conditionally discharged for two years.

15:59.160 --> 16:04.800
She was ordered to pay each victim 50 pounds compensation and 750 pounds costs.

16:04.800 --> 16:09.040
Mr. Abbas insisted that he addressed Camica as ma'am during secondary security checks

16:09.040 --> 16:11.240
and busy terminal four.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.780
That's when the abuse began, he told the trial.

16:13.780 --> 16:16.320
She said, don't talk to me like a dog.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.040
You need to learn some education, you fucking idiot.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.280
She said it with disgust and was looking down at me and made me feel worthless like

16:22.280 --> 16:24.460
I am nothing as if I am a peasant.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.660
She said, you earn six pounds an hour and you think you are God.

16:27.660 --> 16:31.800
He reported the incident to supervisor Mr. Arshad, who told the court, she refused to

16:31.800 --> 16:36.720
stop and completely lost control, just mad I couldn't speak to her.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.600
She completely lost the plot saying that she was transgender and that I wished death on

16:40.600 --> 16:42.040
all transgenders.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.040
She was in a blind rage.

16:44.040 --> 16:48.380
I mean, considering considering the state of Islam right now, it's not an unreasonable

16:48.380 --> 16:53.740
thing to jump to conclusion to, but of course she was still acting ridiculously.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.980
She pointed at my beard and said, I should be afraid of you.

16:56.980 --> 16:58.360
You are the terrorist.

16:58.360 --> 17:04.060
She said I was homosexual and made an oral sex gesture with her hand.

17:04.060 --> 17:09.260
I have never come across anyone that angry or unpredictable in seven years at Heathrow.

17:09.260 --> 17:13.600
I felt intimidated when she came close to my face and poked my shoulder with her fingers.

17:13.600 --> 17:19.560
She said, you're peasants, I'll buy this fucking airport, this fucking plane.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.840
To be called a terrorist because of how I look is disgusting and she lost control with

17:23.840 --> 17:26.260
the police as well.

17:26.260 --> 17:31.120
You think that she would understand that if she was somebody who was called a man because

17:31.120 --> 17:37.560
of how she looks and she felt disgusted by it as she should, then maybe she should also

17:37.560 --> 17:42.820
understand that to call a brown guy with a beard a terrorist because of how he looks

17:42.820 --> 17:44.280
is equally disgusting.

17:44.280 --> 17:49.100
The court heard Kamika also shouted, I've been a woman for 20 years.

17:49.100 --> 17:54.580
So you, you had the surgery when you were three years old to call me, sir is a crime.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.920
I've got a diplomatic passport.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.140
You can't do anything to me.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.140
I know my rights.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.820
Kamika, who has a PhD in law was upset.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.760
There was no Jewish Torah on which to swear an oath.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.020
She told the court it's okay.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.400
My rates are breached every day.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.180
What a fucking snowflake.

18:11.180 --> 18:16.340
But let's switch back to a biological CIS woman for a bit.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.340
Here's polygon.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.340
Oh yeah.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.300
Where did your ads go?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
I blocked them.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.900
Ninja explains his choice not to stream with female gamers.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.760
The only way to avoid the rumors is to not play with them at all.

18:29.760 --> 18:34.060
Now for those of you who don't know, Ninja is the biggest streamer on Twitch right now.

18:34.060 --> 18:39.600
He streams mostly Fortnite, I think it's almost almost completely Fortnite.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.520
And he makes something like a quarter million dollars a month on Twitch.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.800
He has, I think it's in the six digits regularly whenever he streams.

18:46.800 --> 18:52.520
Like he is the biggest guy on Twitch right now.

18:52.520 --> 18:57.520
And I want, I want it to be known before we read this article that he's married.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
All right.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.560
I don't think his wife streams with him, but he's married.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.400
He's monogamous.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.160
And that's, I guess he, I guess he, that's how he wants to keep things.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.440
So let's read this article.

19:11.440 --> 19:16.200
I don't play with female gamers, says Tyler Ninja Blevins, Twitch's biggest streamer and

19:16.200 --> 19:18.660
one of the faces of the Fortnite fandom.

19:18.660 --> 19:23.060
This edict may be surprising to hear, especially as emphatically as Blevins said it when we

19:23.060 --> 19:25.200
spoke at a recent Samsung event.

19:25.200 --> 19:29.040
If I have one conversation with one female streamer where we're playing with one another

19:29.040 --> 19:33.520
and there's even a hint of flirting that is going to be taken and going to be put on every

19:33.520 --> 19:35.920
single video and be clickbait forever.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.320
You know, that, that is actually true.

19:37.320 --> 19:42.320
I remember seeing two streamers, Eloise and Hafu, they're both Hearthstone streamers.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.320
They're both Chinese women.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.760
And they kind of played up the whole he, he were dating thing when they're not dating,

19:50.760 --> 19:52.000
they're both straight.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.920
But for a long time people were saying, Oh, they're lesbians together.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.320
You know, Twitch likes to do that.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.560
Fandoms like to do that.

19:58.560 --> 20:07.680
So if he's happily married and he wants to just kind of keep things private like that,

20:07.680 --> 20:11.280
keep his romantic life private, then yeah, you're going to avoid streaming with people

20:11.280 --> 20:16.280
whom a fandom might start spreading the rumor that you guys are dating or something, or

20:16.280 --> 20:19.880
that they might start shipping you, you know, they're going to, he's going to avoid that

20:19.880 --> 20:21.760
and it's reasonable to do so.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.540
Ninja said, not being connected to other women online.

20:24.540 --> 20:27.800
That was something I made a hundred percent sure it was his decision alone to keep his

20:27.800 --> 20:29.840
streaming partners men only.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.840
That was not even her.

20:30.840 --> 20:31.840
She had nothing to do with it.

20:31.840 --> 20:36.000
That was me being, I love our relationship and no, I'm not going to put you through that.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.280
A growing Twitch means a diminishing sense of privacy, especially for women on the platform.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.000
Female streamers have opened up before about the difficulty in maintaining a separation

20:43.000 --> 20:47.800
between their Twitch personas and who they are offline, often at the behest of viewers

20:47.800 --> 20:51.080
who demand answers, lest they assume what's going on for themselves.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.960
So this article is surprisingly from Polygon, a reasonably fair article.

20:55.960 --> 21:02.080
And it is just about how Ninja doesn't stream with women because he's married.

21:02.080 --> 21:07.040
He doesn't want the community to start spinning up rumors about him and how maybe that's a

21:07.040 --> 21:09.800
bit discriminatory, but it's also reasonable on his end.

21:09.800 --> 21:16.180
But then we get this tweet thread from our good friend, Nathan Grayson.

21:16.180 --> 21:22.280
Now those of you who remember Nathan Grayson, he, he was one of the, uh, the five guys from

21:22.280 --> 21:25.360
Gamergate, one of the guys who fucked Zoe Quinn.

21:25.360 --> 21:30.740
And while he was fucking her, he was also reporting on a game jam she was involved in

21:30.740 --> 21:35.200
and spinning her story in that report to be extremely positive when there's evidence that

21:35.200 --> 21:36.680
it might not have been.

21:36.680 --> 21:41.800
So that, that was the, the ethics and games journalism of Gamergate, by the way.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.480
But here's his take on it.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.760
Ninja's stance here is thorny as hell.

21:45.760 --> 21:50.140
While I get where he's coming from, this lends credence to the idea that women are different

21:50.140 --> 21:52.180
and should be treated as such.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.460
Well, it's his own personal opinion.

21:54.460 --> 21:59.120
Like I assume that if his wife had a problem with it, his wife would let him know.

21:59.120 --> 22:03.680
I don't think it's your place to stick social justice into their fucking marriage.

22:03.680 --> 22:07.820
Part of the reason this sort of thing happens is that Twitch is dominated by dudes who play

22:07.820 --> 22:09.740
with other dudes.

22:09.740 --> 22:13.340
Ninja is more visible than anybody and could do a lot to change that perception if he so

22:13.340 --> 22:18.220
chose, but he'd have to really commit to it and he doesn't seem to care enough.

22:18.220 --> 22:24.220
Well, his platform is not yours for you to promote your social ideas on, Nathan.

22:24.220 --> 22:29.700
Ninja has no obligation to use his platform to push any kind of social change.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.420
It's his show, not yours.

22:31.420 --> 22:36.960
And this is the absolute worst thing about hegemonic social justice is that when you

22:36.960 --> 22:42.220
build an independent platform, like Ninja has, or like, you know, in the whole comics

22:42.220 --> 22:47.060
gate thing, when people started bypassing the SJWs in comics and they were, they started

22:47.060 --> 22:52.460
directly crowdfunding the comics they wanted to see through Kickstarter or whatever, SJWs

22:52.460 --> 22:54.500
become fucking livid.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.140
They're like, Oh, you've, you've built a platform.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.140
You're influential.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.780
Well, now you have to push our politics.

22:59.780 --> 23:06.120
Now you have a moral obligation to push our politics because we, we are the ones who understand

23:06.120 --> 23:08.180
what morality is.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.140
And that really is the problem with the larger left.

23:11.140 --> 23:15.380
Like this is, this is obviously a story about video games basically, but it's a problem

23:15.380 --> 23:19.420
with the larger left that the left believe that they have a moral high ground, which

23:19.420 --> 23:21.680
they don't, but they believe they do.

23:21.680 --> 23:28.400
And they believe that moral high ground should give them access to every, every section of

23:28.400 --> 23:32.300
life, every large platform, every mode of influence.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.700
They say, because we are right, because we're right.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.720
We need to use every avenue to get our message out there.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.220
And even if they were completely right, which they're obviously not, but even if they were

23:42.220 --> 23:45.460
completely right, I don't think it follows.

23:45.460 --> 23:50.320
I don't think it logically follows at all that therefore they have the right to platforms

23:50.320 --> 23:51.320
they don't own.

23:51.320 --> 23:55.500
Ninja has no obligation to push this guy's brand of idiotic politics.

23:55.500 --> 23:59.740
And even if his politics were correct, he still has no obligation to push them.

23:59.740 --> 24:01.580
All right, my friends, that does it for me.

24:01.580 --> 24:06.460
I'm going to turn this video recording off and I'm immediately going to go record the

24:06.460 --> 24:07.780
Alex Jones video.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.620
I'm going to be in my, my little office here for, for quite a while.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.140
I'll see you guys later.

24:13.140 --> 24:13.640
I love you.
