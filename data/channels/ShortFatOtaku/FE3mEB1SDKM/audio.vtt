00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
I have covered a lot of shootings on this channel.

00:08.920 --> 00:13.080
It feels like there's been a disproportionate amount of them in 2022, though maybe that's

00:13.080 --> 00:15.440
just because I'm paying attention right now.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.360
And a lot of them have been on the TUBcast with Lilith, but not this time.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.560
This event doesn't need a two-hour breakdown, step-by-step, of what happened.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.460
It's surprisingly simple.

00:25.460 --> 00:34.300
Around 4.55pm on July 17th, 2022, Jonathan Seppermann walked a mile from his apartment

00:34.300 --> 00:39.460
to the mall, carrying two semi-automatic rifles, a pistol, and over 100 rounds of ammo.

00:39.460 --> 00:43.340
He went into a bathroom in the mall's food court and began his preparations.

00:43.340 --> 00:46.980
He emerged an hour later and began firing into the food court.

00:46.980 --> 00:51.220
Seppermann managed to kill three people, a man standing near the restroom entrance and

00:51.220 --> 00:53.380
a couple sitting at a table in the food court.

00:53.380 --> 00:57.580
He also injured two more, a 22-year-old woman and a 12-year-old girl.

00:57.580 --> 01:01.820
But unlike most rampages, where the body count quickly begins to rack up, his shooting only

01:01.820 --> 01:03.640
lasted 15 seconds.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.920
The reason for that is becauseâ€¦

01:05.920 --> 01:06.920
These names today, man!

01:06.920 --> 01:07.920
Elishja?

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920
It's not a typo, is it?

01:08.920 --> 01:18.140
It looks like Elijah, but it's Elishja, E-L-I-S-J-S-H-A, Elishja, Elishja Dickon.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.540
Elishja Dickon had a handgun on him.

01:20.540 --> 01:23.700
Dickon was legally allowed to carry his handgun.

01:23.700 --> 01:27.940
Fifteen seconds into the shooting, Dickon returned fire, firing ten bullets and hitting

01:27.940 --> 01:29.820
Seppermann with eight of them.

01:29.820 --> 01:34.060
Seppermann attempted to engage, but instead quickly succumbed to his injuries.

01:34.060 --> 01:37.980
During and after the firefight, Dickon motioned for bystanders to escape through the mall

01:37.980 --> 01:41.260
behind him, and he approached Seppermann to ensure that he was actually dead.

01:41.260 --> 01:44.540
Despite the prevalence of cell phones in today's modern world, none of this appears to have

01:44.540 --> 01:45.740
been captured on video.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.520
Or at least the video hasn't been made public.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.720
Maybe something will surface from a cell phone or a security camera in the future.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.400
Plus, fifteen seconds isn't exactly enough time to react to a shooting and consciously

01:54.400 --> 01:57.660
choose to record the event rather than, you know, run for your life.

01:57.660 --> 02:01.960
But a few random people did fire up Facebook live streams in the minutes after the shooting,

02:01.960 --> 02:05.200
in which we can see police sweeping the mall, connecting with citizens, and leading them

02:05.200 --> 02:06.280
safely outside.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.920
Dickon had no military or police experience.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.920
He was simply a responsible firearm owner who had been taught how to shoot by his grandfather.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.760
After the shooting, Dickon did the responsible thing yet again.

02:16.760 --> 02:21.320
He informed mall security that he had killed the shooter, he waited for police to arrive,

02:21.320 --> 02:23.160
and he gave his statement to the cops.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.680
Dickon has refused to talk to the media out of respect for both the ongoing investigation

02:27.680 --> 02:29.660
and the lives that were lost.

02:29.660 --> 02:33.600
This is the quintessential good guy with a gun story that so many republicans like to

02:33.600 --> 02:36.500
lean on when talking about the importance of the second amendment.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.560
And hey, fair enough, who knows how much worse it could have gotten.

02:39.560 --> 02:44.240
I don't know if mall security is armed in the states, I mean probably it is the states,

02:44.240 --> 02:47.440
but five people got shot over the course of 15 seconds.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.320
Imagine how many more people it could have been if another 30 seconds had to be spent

02:51.320 --> 02:55.800
waiting for mall security to show up, or worse, multiple minutes waiting for the cops.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.600
I'm not shitting on security or the cops here, I know that there's limited resources, and

02:59.600 --> 03:01.720
they can't instantly be everywhere at all times.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.600
In fact, this is something that the Greenwood police even admitted during their press conference

03:05.600 --> 03:09.680
after the shooting, that without a good samaritan with a gun, this event would have been a lot

03:09.680 --> 03:10.680
worse.

03:10.680 --> 03:17.040
This Samaritan, I will say, his actions were nothing short of heroic.

03:17.040 --> 03:24.080
He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun, was very proficient in that,

03:24.080 --> 03:31.880
very tactically sound, and as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning

03:31.880 --> 03:35.920
for people to exit behind him.

03:35.920 --> 03:41.800
To our knowledge, he has no police training and no military background.

03:41.800 --> 03:50.040
He has authorized us to release his name, he is requesting you give him time to process

03:50.040 --> 03:54.260
and grieve himself before reaching out to him.

03:54.260 --> 03:56.040
His name is Elijah Dickon.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.440
Oh, it is Elijah, okay, okay.

03:58.440 --> 04:03.320
My point is, one of the perks of a responsibly armed populace, keyword being responsibly,

04:03.320 --> 04:06.940
is that you get people like Dickon, who do the right thing when they find themselves

04:06.940 --> 04:08.480
in that situation.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.480
As for the shooter, Jonathan Seperman, his story sounds a lot like the stories of many

04:12.480 --> 04:13.800
other shooters I've covered.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.880
His family life was troubled, his parents divorced in 2017, he was placed in a foster

04:17.880 --> 04:22.060
family but was kicked out of the foster program after allegations of abuse came to light.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.960
He had a record for fighting while attending Greenwood High School, and he was also a juvenile

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
runaway.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.680
He had a job working at a warehouse, which he quit back in May, and he was facing eviction

04:30.680 --> 04:32.600
from his apartment at the end of the month.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.080
By all accounts, this looks like a guy who had a bad start in life, couldn't pull it

04:36.080 --> 04:39.440
together as an adult, and when he hit the end of his rope, he decided to go out in a

04:39.440 --> 04:42.760
blaze of glory, which was cut short by Dickon's actions.

04:42.760 --> 04:48.680
This post was made on 4chan's bant board at 4.13pm, saying, name is Jonathan and today

04:48.680 --> 04:51.020
seems like a good day to die, with an imager link.

04:51.020 --> 04:54.500
The imager link is, of course, dead by now, but its contents were saved.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.720
It contained pics of this twink-looking kid wearing a vest with the guns used in the attack,

04:58.720 --> 05:00.940
and it seems like this is Jonathan Seperman.

05:00.940 --> 05:04.820
He had torched his laptop in his apartment's oven before leaving for the mall, so it seems

05:04.820 --> 05:07.860
like he posted this on 4chan as a goodbye to the world.

05:07.860 --> 05:12.260
However, that initial post on 4chan has caught the media's eye because of the pic used as

05:12.260 --> 05:13.340
the op image.

05:13.340 --> 05:17.380
The image is a historical photo of a low-ranking Nazi officer getting married.

05:17.380 --> 05:21.140
The media is taking this as proof positive that this was another white supremacist, white

05:21.140 --> 05:25.060
nationalist neo-nazi shooting, just like the Buffalo supermarket guy.

05:25.060 --> 05:29.580
And you know, it could be, but it also could just be a shitpost by somebody who knows enough

05:29.580 --> 05:33.200
about 4chan culture to know that this is exactly how the media would take this sort

05:33.200 --> 05:34.200
of thing.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.200
Personally, I don't know.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.940
I don't think this was a neo-nazi thing.

05:36.940 --> 05:40.940
I think this guy wanted attention and saw the 4chan post as a way to get it.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.300
I mean, look at how he's posing in these photos.

05:43.300 --> 05:47.100
He thinks he's looking cool, but he actually looks like a virgin with an ill-fitting vest,

05:47.100 --> 05:51.060
and all he accomplished was failing at a shooting spree only to be shot dead by your average

05:51.060 --> 05:52.060
chad.

05:52.060 --> 05:56.380
His last moments were probably him realizing that he had, once again, failed at yet another

05:56.380 --> 05:57.500
thing in his life.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.540
I have no idea what actually caused this event.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.820
I have a hunch, though.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.060
This part is just entirely my own intuition.

06:03.060 --> 06:07.960
I think guys like this show why that old Jordan Petersonian advice of clean your room, not

06:07.960 --> 06:13.540
so much his new stuff, is extremely important.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.580
People aren't being told anymore that hard work pays off.

06:16.580 --> 06:21.860
They're not experiencing that feeling of small accruing gains compounding over time.

06:21.860 --> 06:26.020
And just as importantly, they're also not seeing those small compounding failures over

06:26.020 --> 06:27.460
time anymore either.

06:27.460 --> 06:32.100
At least not until they get so bad that the problem feels like it's become insurmountable.

06:32.100 --> 06:37.140
Like say, if you've lost your family and lost your job and you're about to lose your apartment.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.160
And yeah, that tracks with this guy's life.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.160
Just look at it.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.020
Failed family, failed youth, failed job, failed apartment, failed life.

06:44.020 --> 06:48.380
I have a feeling he never learned the power of snowballing little victories into large

06:48.380 --> 06:52.660
ones, or what happens when you allow small defeats to become huge by not confronting

06:52.660 --> 06:53.660
them.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.820
Nobody tells people this stuff anymore.

06:55.820 --> 06:59.420
Nobody learns that there's actually a way forward through adversity and that you don't

06:59.420 --> 07:01.780
have to resort to doing this.

07:01.780 --> 07:07.340
However, Sapirman's story has been entirely overshadowed by the heroism of Dickens' actions,

07:07.340 --> 07:08.340
as it should be.

07:08.340 --> 07:11.820
I might be analyzing Sapirman as a tragic figure, but at the end of the day, he still

07:11.820 --> 07:12.940
chose his path.

07:12.940 --> 07:15.100
He's still ultimately a monster.

07:15.100 --> 07:20.240
Dickens shows why America is correct in valuing a responsibly armed populace, again, the keyword

07:20.240 --> 07:21.940
being responsibly.

07:21.940 --> 07:26.120
Consider this, both Dickens and Sapirman legally owned their firearms.

07:26.120 --> 07:31.200
Both of them exemplify arguments either for or against regulating or banning guns.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.620
It's true that Sapirman would have had a harder time committing his shooting if guns were

07:34.620 --> 07:35.900
harder to come by.

07:35.900 --> 07:40.940
Yes, legally banning guns doesn't make illegal guns vanish into the ether.

07:40.940 --> 07:44.400
But come on, do you think a guy like this really had the gumption to go out and get

07:44.400 --> 07:46.540
illegal guns if that's what he wanted to do?

07:46.540 --> 07:47.900
I don't think so.

07:47.900 --> 07:52.660
At the same time, if guns were banned, and Sapirman did get a hold of illegal guns, Dickens

07:52.660 --> 07:55.140
would have had a much harder time stopping him.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.980
In fact, Dickens could have been one of his victims.

07:57.980 --> 08:02.700
What differentiates these two people isn't gun access, but what each of them chose to

08:02.700 --> 08:04.700
do with that access.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.460
Sapirman chose to be a monster.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.600
Dickens chose to defend his community.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.220
If there's ever a story that proves true the adage of, guns don't kill people, people

08:13.220 --> 08:15.160
kill people, it's this one.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.380
At the start of the video, I mentioned that I covered a lot of shooters this year, and

08:17.380 --> 08:19.580
it goes without saying that there seems to be a lot of them right now.

08:19.580 --> 08:23.740
Peyton Genden, the Buffalo supermarket shooter who dropped a white nationalist manifesto

08:23.740 --> 08:25.440
plagiarized from the Christchurch guy.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.980
He had a history of neo-nazi rhetoric online, and he had withdrawn from his family and his

08:28.980 --> 08:30.340
school and his life.

08:30.340 --> 08:34.580
Salvador Ramos, the Uvalde school shooter who crashed his car in an attempt to get to

08:34.580 --> 08:35.580
his target.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.260
He came from a broken home, and eventually moved in with his grandmother, who he fought

08:38.260 --> 08:39.840
with over his failure to graduate.

08:39.840 --> 08:43.780
Robert Cremo, the Highland Park shooter who opened fire into a 4th of July celebration

08:43.780 --> 08:45.320
in a Jewish neighborhood in Chicago.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.240
He hung out on 4chan posting neo-nazi stuff, and he had also failed at a school and had

08:49.240 --> 08:50.680
a deteriorating family life.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.060
And now, this guy.

08:52.060 --> 08:56.260
Both the mainstream media, and surely most leftoid youtubers and streamers who are talking

08:56.260 --> 09:01.740
about this event, will pin everything on 4chan, edgy internet speech, and neo-nazi radicalization.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.040
But I think they've got it backwards.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.140
I think the Nazi stuff is a symptom of the problem, not the cause.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.140
Look at these guys.

09:07.140 --> 09:11.500
The joke going around right now is that this picture is the Gen Z physiognomy check.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.860
And yeah, that's pretty funny, at least if you like dark humor.

09:13.860 --> 09:17.460
But I'm reminded more of the bio-Leninism theory that's floating around within neo-reactionary

09:17.460 --> 09:18.700
circles right now.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.780
Leninism was a specific type of socialism developed by Vladimir Lenin.

09:21.780 --> 09:24.820
I spoke a little bit about this in my recent video on the left-hating of farmers.

09:24.820 --> 09:29.080
One of the early practical stages of the implementation of Leninism was rounding up all of the social

09:29.080 --> 09:32.900
rejects who are bitter and angry at the most successful members of their community, give

09:32.900 --> 09:36.100
them weapons, give them the authority of the state, and tell them that their lives were

09:36.100 --> 09:40.540
in shambles because the parasitic kulak, who just so happened to be their more successful

09:40.540 --> 09:44.460
and hardworking neighbor that they were jealous of, was the cause of all of their problems.

09:44.460 --> 09:49.300
A core component of Leninism was a revolution by the rejects of society, the people who

09:49.300 --> 09:53.020
were bitter at everything and everyone because of their own failures.

09:53.020 --> 09:57.500
Bio-Leninism, as theorized by the Anorexors, is the idea that the same process is happening

09:57.500 --> 10:01.940
in the modern day, but this time without the agitation of a socialist party and instead

10:01.940 --> 10:06.500
happening in a quasi-isolated and decentralized manner, and this time not specifically due

10:06.500 --> 10:07.800
to economic failure.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.320
Genetic failure may be a part of it, but so is failure with women, failure at school,

10:11.320 --> 10:12.840
or just general life failure.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.740
The Anorexors believe this is a biological inevitability, that these genetic inferiors

10:16.740 --> 10:21.280
will always constitute a lower class, and if given freedom, will always use it to lash

10:21.280 --> 10:24.760
out at what they deem more reproductively successful than them.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.880
I'm not sure if I agree with that conclusion, but I do think their initial analysis is probably

10:28.880 --> 10:29.880
correct.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.020
I did a video years and years ago titled, Islamist or incel, where I pointed out that

10:33.020 --> 10:36.880
even as these people commit horrible acts and do genuinely become monsters, they are

10:36.880 --> 10:40.360
also tragic figures, right up until that point of no return.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.800
The framework that they rely on to commit these acts, whether it's socialism or fascism

10:43.800 --> 10:46.860
or islamism, that framework isn't the cause of it, ultimately.

10:46.860 --> 10:48.640
Their own collapsing life is.

10:48.640 --> 10:52.120
These frameworks create post hoc justifications for their actions.

10:52.120 --> 10:55.680
People generally don't get sucked into an extremist ideology unless their own engagement

10:55.680 --> 10:57.640
with society has already deteriorated.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.520
In other words, it's revenge against God for the crime of being.

11:00.520 --> 11:04.300
I told you that Jordan Peterson had good ideas, despite his recent weird turn.

11:04.300 --> 11:08.160
Society is set up in such a way that if you engage with its structures properly, you can

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
generally get ahead.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.160
It's not guaranteed.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.260
Some people are better off forging their own path.

11:12.260 --> 11:15.840
Some people don't engage, lie to everybody that they are, and then become bitter due

11:15.840 --> 11:17.180
to their own cowardice.

11:17.180 --> 11:20.800
Some people do genuinely engage, but due to random chances, it doesn't work out for them.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.300
And they too become bitter.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.300
And you know what?

11:23.300 --> 11:26.260
Surely we've all felt this way at least once in our lives, right?

11:26.260 --> 11:29.640
In fact, based on the comments on my liminal video, I know we all have.

11:29.640 --> 11:34.220
These people could be us had we made different choices during our worst moments.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.540
Where but for the grace of God go we.

11:36.540 --> 11:37.540
They are monsters.

11:37.540 --> 11:41.180
But I think we would make a fatal mistake to say that their motivations are unknowable,

11:41.180 --> 11:43.880
or that their actions are surprising given the circumstances.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.820
The darkest part of your heart that you've buried for years, it knows exactly what's

11:47.820 --> 11:48.820
going on here.

11:48.820 --> 11:52.020
And you do too, if you have the strength of character to ask it.
