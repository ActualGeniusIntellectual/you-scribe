0	8920	I have covered a lot of shootings on this channel.
8920	13080	It feels like there's been a disproportionate amount of them in 2022, though maybe that's
13080	15440	just because I'm paying attention right now.
15440	19360	And a lot of them have been on the TUBcast with Lilith, but not this time.
19360	23560	This event doesn't need a two-hour breakdown, step-by-step, of what happened.
23560	25460	It's surprisingly simple.
25460	34300	Around 4.55pm on July 17th, 2022, Jonathan Seppermann walked a mile from his apartment
34300	39460	to the mall, carrying two semi-automatic rifles, a pistol, and over 100 rounds of ammo.
39460	43340	He went into a bathroom in the mall's food court and began his preparations.
43340	46980	He emerged an hour later and began firing into the food court.
46980	51220	Seppermann managed to kill three people, a man standing near the restroom entrance and
51220	53380	a couple sitting at a table in the food court.
53380	57580	He also injured two more, a 22-year-old woman and a 12-year-old girl.
57580	61820	But unlike most rampages, where the body count quickly begins to rack up, his shooting only
61820	63640	lasted 15 seconds.
63640	65920	The reason for that is becauseâ€¦
65920	66920	These names today, man!
66920	67920	Elishja?
67920	68920	It's not a typo, is it?
68920	78140	It looks like Elijah, but it's Elishja, E-L-I-S-J-S-H-A, Elishja, Elishja Dickon.
78140	80540	Elishja Dickon had a handgun on him.
80540	83700	Dickon was legally allowed to carry his handgun.
83700	87940	Fifteen seconds into the shooting, Dickon returned fire, firing ten bullets and hitting
87940	89820	Seppermann with eight of them.
89820	94060	Seppermann attempted to engage, but instead quickly succumbed to his injuries.
94060	97980	During and after the firefight, Dickon motioned for bystanders to escape through the mall
97980	101260	behind him, and he approached Seppermann to ensure that he was actually dead.
101260	104540	Despite the prevalence of cell phones in today's modern world, none of this appears to have
104540	105740	been captured on video.
105740	107520	Or at least the video hasn't been made public.
107520	110720	Maybe something will surface from a cell phone or a security camera in the future.
110720	114400	Plus, fifteen seconds isn't exactly enough time to react to a shooting and consciously
114400	117660	choose to record the event rather than, you know, run for your life.
117660	121960	But a few random people did fire up Facebook live streams in the minutes after the shooting,
121960	125200	in which we can see police sweeping the mall, connecting with citizens, and leading them
125200	126280	safely outside.
126280	128920	Dickon had no military or police experience.
128920	133920	He was simply a responsible firearm owner who had been taught how to shoot by his grandfather.
133920	136760	After the shooting, Dickon did the responsible thing yet again.
136760	141320	He informed mall security that he had killed the shooter, he waited for police to arrive,
141320	143160	and he gave his statement to the cops.
143160	147680	Dickon has refused to talk to the media out of respect for both the ongoing investigation
147680	149660	and the lives that were lost.
149660	153600	This is the quintessential good guy with a gun story that so many republicans like to
153600	156500	lean on when talking about the importance of the second amendment.
156500	159560	And hey, fair enough, who knows how much worse it could have gotten.
159560	164240	I don't know if mall security is armed in the states, I mean probably it is the states,
164240	167440	but five people got shot over the course of 15 seconds.
167440	171320	Imagine how many more people it could have been if another 30 seconds had to be spent
171320	175800	waiting for mall security to show up, or worse, multiple minutes waiting for the cops.
175800	179600	I'm not shitting on security or the cops here, I know that there's limited resources, and
179600	181720	they can't instantly be everywhere at all times.
181720	185600	In fact, this is something that the Greenwood police even admitted during their press conference
185600	189680	after the shooting, that without a good samaritan with a gun, this event would have been a lot
189680	190680	worse.
190680	197040	This Samaritan, I will say, his actions were nothing short of heroic.
197040	204080	He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun, was very proficient in that,
204080	211880	very tactically sound, and as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning
211880	215920	for people to exit behind him.
215920	221800	To our knowledge, he has no police training and no military background.
221800	230040	He has authorized us to release his name, he is requesting you give him time to process
230040	234260	and grieve himself before reaching out to him.
234260	236040	His name is Elijah Dickon.
236040	238440	Oh, it is Elijah, okay, okay.
238440	243320	My point is, one of the perks of a responsibly armed populace, keyword being responsibly,
243320	246940	is that you get people like Dickon, who do the right thing when they find themselves
246940	248480	in that situation.
248480	252480	As for the shooter, Jonathan Seperman, his story sounds a lot like the stories of many
252480	253800	other shooters I've covered.
253800	257880	His family life was troubled, his parents divorced in 2017, he was placed in a foster
257880	262060	family but was kicked out of the foster program after allegations of abuse came to light.
262060	265960	He had a record for fighting while attending Greenwood High School, and he was also a juvenile
265960	266960	runaway.
266960	270680	He had a job working at a warehouse, which he quit back in May, and he was facing eviction
270680	272600	from his apartment at the end of the month.
272600	276080	By all accounts, this looks like a guy who had a bad start in life, couldn't pull it
276080	279440	together as an adult, and when he hit the end of his rope, he decided to go out in a
279440	282760	blaze of glory, which was cut short by Dickon's actions.
282760	288680	This post was made on 4chan's bant board at 4.13pm, saying, name is Jonathan and today
288680	291020	seems like a good day to die, with an imager link.
291020	294500	The imager link is, of course, dead by now, but its contents were saved.
294500	298720	It contained pics of this twink-looking kid wearing a vest with the guns used in the attack,
298720	300940	and it seems like this is Jonathan Seperman.
300940	304820	He had torched his laptop in his apartment's oven before leaving for the mall, so it seems
304820	307860	like he posted this on 4chan as a goodbye to the world.
307860	312260	However, that initial post on 4chan has caught the media's eye because of the pic used as
312260	313340	the op image.
313340	317380	The image is a historical photo of a low-ranking Nazi officer getting married.
317380	321140	The media is taking this as proof positive that this was another white supremacist, white
321140	325060	nationalist neo-nazi shooting, just like the Buffalo supermarket guy.
325060	329580	And you know, it could be, but it also could just be a shitpost by somebody who knows enough
329580	333200	about 4chan culture to know that this is exactly how the media would take this sort
333200	334200	of thing.
334200	335200	Personally, I don't know.
335200	336940	I don't think this was a neo-nazi thing.
336940	340940	I think this guy wanted attention and saw the 4chan post as a way to get it.
340940	343300	I mean, look at how he's posing in these photos.
343300	347100	He thinks he's looking cool, but he actually looks like a virgin with an ill-fitting vest,
347100	351060	and all he accomplished was failing at a shooting spree only to be shot dead by your average
351060	352060	chad.
352060	356380	His last moments were probably him realizing that he had, once again, failed at yet another
356380	357500	thing in his life.
357500	359540	I have no idea what actually caused this event.
359540	360820	I have a hunch, though.
360820	363060	This part is just entirely my own intuition.
363060	367960	I think guys like this show why that old Jordan Petersonian advice of clean your room, not
367960	373540	so much his new stuff, is extremely important.
373540	376580	People aren't being told anymore that hard work pays off.
376580	381860	They're not experiencing that feeling of small accruing gains compounding over time.
381860	386020	And just as importantly, they're also not seeing those small compounding failures over
386020	387460	time anymore either.
387460	392100	At least not until they get so bad that the problem feels like it's become insurmountable.
392100	397140	Like say, if you've lost your family and lost your job and you're about to lose your apartment.
397140	399160	And yeah, that tracks with this guy's life.
399160	400160	Just look at it.
400160	404020	Failed family, failed youth, failed job, failed apartment, failed life.
404020	408380	I have a feeling he never learned the power of snowballing little victories into large
408380	412660	ones, or what happens when you allow small defeats to become huge by not confronting
412660	413660	them.
413660	415820	Nobody tells people this stuff anymore.
415820	419420	Nobody learns that there's actually a way forward through adversity and that you don't
419420	421780	have to resort to doing this.
421780	427340	However, Sapirman's story has been entirely overshadowed by the heroism of Dickens' actions,
427340	428340	as it should be.
428340	431820	I might be analyzing Sapirman as a tragic figure, but at the end of the day, he still
431820	432940	chose his path.
432940	435100	He's still ultimately a monster.
435100	440240	Dickens shows why America is correct in valuing a responsibly armed populace, again, the keyword
440240	441940	being responsibly.
441940	446120	Consider this, both Dickens and Sapirman legally owned their firearms.
446120	451200	Both of them exemplify arguments either for or against regulating or banning guns.
451200	454620	It's true that Sapirman would have had a harder time committing his shooting if guns were
454620	455900	harder to come by.
455900	460940	Yes, legally banning guns doesn't make illegal guns vanish into the ether.
460940	464400	But come on, do you think a guy like this really had the gumption to go out and get
464400	466540	illegal guns if that's what he wanted to do?
466540	467900	I don't think so.
467900	472660	At the same time, if guns were banned, and Sapirman did get a hold of illegal guns, Dickens
472660	475140	would have had a much harder time stopping him.
475140	477980	In fact, Dickens could have been one of his victims.
477980	482700	What differentiates these two people isn't gun access, but what each of them chose to
482700	484700	do with that access.
484700	486460	Sapirman chose to be a monster.
486460	488600	Dickens chose to defend his community.
488600	493220	If there's ever a story that proves true the adage of, guns don't kill people, people
493220	495160	kill people, it's this one.
495160	497380	At the start of the video, I mentioned that I covered a lot of shooters this year, and
497380	499580	it goes without saying that there seems to be a lot of them right now.
499580	503740	Peyton Genden, the Buffalo supermarket shooter who dropped a white nationalist manifesto
503740	505440	plagiarized from the Christchurch guy.
505440	508980	He had a history of neo-nazi rhetoric online, and he had withdrawn from his family and his
508980	510340	school and his life.
510340	514580	Salvador Ramos, the Uvalde school shooter who crashed his car in an attempt to get to
514580	515580	his target.
515580	518260	He came from a broken home, and eventually moved in with his grandmother, who he fought
518260	519840	with over his failure to graduate.
519840	523780	Robert Cremo, the Highland Park shooter who opened fire into a 4th of July celebration
523780	525320	in a Jewish neighborhood in Chicago.
525320	529240	He hung out on 4chan posting neo-nazi stuff, and he had also failed at a school and had
529240	530680	a deteriorating family life.
530680	532060	And now, this guy.
532060	536260	Both the mainstream media, and surely most leftoid youtubers and streamers who are talking
536260	541740	about this event, will pin everything on 4chan, edgy internet speech, and neo-nazi radicalization.
541740	543040	But I think they've got it backwards.
543040	546140	I think the Nazi stuff is a symptom of the problem, not the cause.
546140	547140	Look at these guys.
547140	551500	The joke going around right now is that this picture is the Gen Z physiognomy check.
551500	553860	And yeah, that's pretty funny, at least if you like dark humor.
553860	557460	But I'm reminded more of the bio-Leninism theory that's floating around within neo-reactionary
557460	558700	circles right now.
558700	561780	Leninism was a specific type of socialism developed by Vladimir Lenin.
561780	564820	I spoke a little bit about this in my recent video on the left-hating of farmers.
564820	569080	One of the early practical stages of the implementation of Leninism was rounding up all of the social
569080	572900	rejects who are bitter and angry at the most successful members of their community, give
572900	576100	them weapons, give them the authority of the state, and tell them that their lives were
576100	580540	in shambles because the parasitic kulak, who just so happened to be their more successful
580540	584460	and hardworking neighbor that they were jealous of, was the cause of all of their problems.
584460	589300	A core component of Leninism was a revolution by the rejects of society, the people who
589300	593020	were bitter at everything and everyone because of their own failures.
593020	597500	Bio-Leninism, as theorized by the Anorexors, is the idea that the same process is happening
597500	601940	in the modern day, but this time without the agitation of a socialist party and instead
601940	606500	happening in a quasi-isolated and decentralized manner, and this time not specifically due
606500	607800	to economic failure.
607800	611320	Genetic failure may be a part of it, but so is failure with women, failure at school,
611320	612840	or just general life failure.
612840	616740	The Anorexors believe this is a biological inevitability, that these genetic inferiors
616740	621280	will always constitute a lower class, and if given freedom, will always use it to lash
621280	624760	out at what they deem more reproductively successful than them.
624760	628880	I'm not sure if I agree with that conclusion, but I do think their initial analysis is probably
628880	629880	correct.
629880	633020	I did a video years and years ago titled, Islamist or incel, where I pointed out that
633020	636880	even as these people commit horrible acts and do genuinely become monsters, they are
636880	640360	also tragic figures, right up until that point of no return.
640360	643800	The framework that they rely on to commit these acts, whether it's socialism or fascism
643800	646860	or islamism, that framework isn't the cause of it, ultimately.
646860	648640	Their own collapsing life is.
648640	652120	These frameworks create post hoc justifications for their actions.
652120	655680	People generally don't get sucked into an extremist ideology unless their own engagement
655680	657640	with society has already deteriorated.
657640	660520	In other words, it's revenge against God for the crime of being.
660520	664300	I told you that Jordan Peterson had good ideas, despite his recent weird turn.
664300	668160	Society is set up in such a way that if you engage with its structures properly, you can
668160	669160	generally get ahead.
669160	670160	It's not guaranteed.
670160	672260	Some people are better off forging their own path.
672260	675840	Some people don't engage, lie to everybody that they are, and then become bitter due
675840	677180	to their own cowardice.
677180	680800	Some people do genuinely engage, but due to random chances, it doesn't work out for them.
680800	682300	And they too become bitter.
682300	683300	And you know what?
683300	686260	Surely we've all felt this way at least once in our lives, right?
686260	689640	In fact, based on the comments on my liminal video, I know we all have.
689640	694220	These people could be us had we made different choices during our worst moments.
694220	696540	Where but for the grace of God go we.
696540	697540	They are monsters.
697540	701180	But I think we would make a fatal mistake to say that their motivations are unknowable,
701180	703880	or that their actions are surprising given the circumstances.
703880	707820	The darkest part of your heart that you've buried for years, it knows exactly what's
707820	708820	going on here.
708820	712020	And you do too, if you have the strength of character to ask it.
