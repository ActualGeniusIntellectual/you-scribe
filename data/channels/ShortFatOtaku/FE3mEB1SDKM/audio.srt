1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
I have covered a lot of shootings on this channel.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,080
It feels like there's been a disproportionate amount of them in 2022, though maybe that's

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,440
just because I'm paying attention right now.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,360
And a lot of them have been on the TUBcast with Lilith, but not this time.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,560
This event doesn't need a two-hour breakdown, step-by-step, of what happened.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,460
It's surprisingly simple.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:34,300
Around 4.55pm on July 17th, 2022, Jonathan Seppermann walked a mile from his apartment

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,460
to the mall, carrying two semi-automatic rifles, a pistol, and over 100 rounds of ammo.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,340
He went into a bathroom in the mall's food court and began his preparations.

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,980
He emerged an hour later and began firing into the food court.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,220
Seppermann managed to kill three people, a man standing near the restroom entrance and

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,380
a couple sitting at a table in the food court.

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,580
He also injured two more, a 22-year-old woman and a 12-year-old girl.

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,820
But unlike most rampages, where the body count quickly begins to rack up, his shooting only

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,640
lasted 15 seconds.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,920
The reason for that is becauseâ€¦

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
These names today, man!

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Elishja?

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
It's not a typo, is it?

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:18,140
It looks like Elijah, but it's Elishja, E-L-I-S-J-S-H-A, Elishja, Elishja Dickon.

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,540
Elishja Dickon had a handgun on him.

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,700
Dickon was legally allowed to carry his handgun.

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,940
Fifteen seconds into the shooting, Dickon returned fire, firing ten bullets and hitting

24
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,820
Seppermann with eight of them.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,060
Seppermann attempted to engage, but instead quickly succumbed to his injuries.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,980
During and after the firefight, Dickon motioned for bystanders to escape through the mall

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,260
behind him, and he approached Seppermann to ensure that he was actually dead.

28
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,540
Despite the prevalence of cell phones in today's modern world, none of this appears to have

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,740
been captured on video.

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,520
Or at least the video hasn't been made public.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
Maybe something will surface from a cell phone or a security camera in the future.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,400
Plus, fifteen seconds isn't exactly enough time to react to a shooting and consciously

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,660
choose to record the event rather than, you know, run for your life.

34
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,960
But a few random people did fire up Facebook live streams in the minutes after the shooting,

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,200
in which we can see police sweeping the mall, connecting with citizens, and leading them

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,280
safely outside.

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,920
Dickon had no military or police experience.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,920
He was simply a responsible firearm owner who had been taught how to shoot by his grandfather.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,760
After the shooting, Dickon did the responsible thing yet again.

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,320
He informed mall security that he had killed the shooter, he waited for police to arrive,

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,160
and he gave his statement to the cops.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,680
Dickon has refused to talk to the media out of respect for both the ongoing investigation

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,660
and the lives that were lost.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,600
This is the quintessential good guy with a gun story that so many republicans like to

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,500
lean on when talking about the importance of the second amendment.

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,560
And hey, fair enough, who knows how much worse it could have gotten.

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,240
I don't know if mall security is armed in the states, I mean probably it is the states,

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,440
but five people got shot over the course of 15 seconds.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,320
Imagine how many more people it could have been if another 30 seconds had to be spent

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,800
waiting for mall security to show up, or worse, multiple minutes waiting for the cops.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,600
I'm not shitting on security or the cops here, I know that there's limited resources, and

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,720
they can't instantly be everywhere at all times.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,600
In fact, this is something that the Greenwood police even admitted during their press conference

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,680
after the shooting, that without a good samaritan with a gun, this event would have been a lot

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
worse.

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,040
This Samaritan, I will say, his actions were nothing short of heroic.

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,080
He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun, was very proficient in that,

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,880
very tactically sound, and as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,920
for people to exit behind him.

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,800
To our knowledge, he has no police training and no military background.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:50,040
He has authorized us to release his name, he is requesting you give him time to process

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,260
and grieve himself before reaching out to him.

63
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,040
His name is Elijah Dickon.

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,440
Oh, it is Elijah, okay, okay.

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,320
My point is, one of the perks of a responsibly armed populace, keyword being responsibly,

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,940
is that you get people like Dickon, who do the right thing when they find themselves

67
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,480
in that situation.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
As for the shooter, Jonathan Seperman, his story sounds a lot like the stories of many

69
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,800
other shooters I've covered.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,880
His family life was troubled, his parents divorced in 2017, he was placed in a foster

71
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,060
family but was kicked out of the foster program after allegations of abuse came to light.

72
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,960
He had a record for fighting while attending Greenwood High School, and he was also a juvenile

73
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
runaway.

74
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,680
He had a job working at a warehouse, which he quit back in May, and he was facing eviction

75
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,600
from his apartment at the end of the month.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,080
By all accounts, this looks like a guy who had a bad start in life, couldn't pull it

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,440
together as an adult, and when he hit the end of his rope, he decided to go out in a

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,760
blaze of glory, which was cut short by Dickon's actions.

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,680
This post was made on 4chan's bant board at 4.13pm, saying, name is Jonathan and today

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,020
seems like a good day to die, with an imager link.

81
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,500
The imager link is, of course, dead by now, but its contents were saved.

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,720
It contained pics of this twink-looking kid wearing a vest with the guns used in the attack,

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,940
and it seems like this is Jonathan Seperman.

84
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,820
He had torched his laptop in his apartment's oven before leaving for the mall, so it seems

85
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,860
like he posted this on 4chan as a goodbye to the world.

86
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,260
However, that initial post on 4chan has caught the media's eye because of the pic used as

87
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,340
the op image.

88
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,380
The image is a historical photo of a low-ranking Nazi officer getting married.

89
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,140
The media is taking this as proof positive that this was another white supremacist, white

90
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,060
nationalist neo-nazi shooting, just like the Buffalo supermarket guy.

91
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,580
And you know, it could be, but it also could just be a shitpost by somebody who knows enough

92
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,200
about 4chan culture to know that this is exactly how the media would take this sort

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
of thing.

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Personally, I don't know.

95
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,940
I don't think this was a neo-nazi thing.

96
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,940
I think this guy wanted attention and saw the 4chan post as a way to get it.

97
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,300
I mean, look at how he's posing in these photos.

98
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,100
He thinks he's looking cool, but he actually looks like a virgin with an ill-fitting vest,

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,060
and all he accomplished was failing at a shooting spree only to be shot dead by your average

100
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
chad.

101
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,380
His last moments were probably him realizing that he had, once again, failed at yet another

102
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,500
thing in his life.

103
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,540
I have no idea what actually caused this event.

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,820
I have a hunch, though.

105
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,060
This part is just entirely my own intuition.

106
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,960
I think guys like this show why that old Jordan Petersonian advice of clean your room, not

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,540
so much his new stuff, is extremely important.

108
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,580
People aren't being told anymore that hard work pays off.

109
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,860
They're not experiencing that feeling of small accruing gains compounding over time.

110
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,020
And just as importantly, they're also not seeing those small compounding failures over

111
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,460
time anymore either.

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,100
At least not until they get so bad that the problem feels like it's become insurmountable.

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,140
Like say, if you've lost your family and lost your job and you're about to lose your apartment.

114
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,160
And yeah, that tracks with this guy's life.

115
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Just look at it.

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,020
Failed family, failed youth, failed job, failed apartment, failed life.

117
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,380
I have a feeling he never learned the power of snowballing little victories into large

118
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,660
ones, or what happens when you allow small defeats to become huge by not confronting

119
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
them.

120
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,820
Nobody tells people this stuff anymore.

121
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,420
Nobody learns that there's actually a way forward through adversity and that you don't

122
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,780
have to resort to doing this.

123
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,340
However, Sapirman's story has been entirely overshadowed by the heroism of Dickens' actions,

124
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,340
as it should be.

125
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,820
I might be analyzing Sapirman as a tragic figure, but at the end of the day, he still

126
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,940
chose his path.

127
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,100
He's still ultimately a monster.

128
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,240
Dickens shows why America is correct in valuing a responsibly armed populace, again, the keyword

129
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,940
being responsibly.

130
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,120
Consider this, both Dickens and Sapirman legally owned their firearms.

131
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,200
Both of them exemplify arguments either for or against regulating or banning guns.

132
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,620
It's true that Sapirman would have had a harder time committing his shooting if guns were

133
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,900
harder to come by.

134
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,940
Yes, legally banning guns doesn't make illegal guns vanish into the ether.

135
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,400
But come on, do you think a guy like this really had the gumption to go out and get

136
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,540
illegal guns if that's what he wanted to do?

137
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,900
I don't think so.

138
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,660
At the same time, if guns were banned, and Sapirman did get a hold of illegal guns, Dickens

139
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,140
would have had a much harder time stopping him.

140
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,980
In fact, Dickens could have been one of his victims.

141
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,700
What differentiates these two people isn't gun access, but what each of them chose to

142
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
do with that access.

143
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,460
Sapirman chose to be a monster.

144
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,600
Dickens chose to defend his community.

145
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,220
If there's ever a story that proves true the adage of, guns don't kill people, people

146
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,160
kill people, it's this one.

147
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,380
At the start of the video, I mentioned that I covered a lot of shooters this year, and

148
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,580
it goes without saying that there seems to be a lot of them right now.

149
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,740
Peyton Genden, the Buffalo supermarket shooter who dropped a white nationalist manifesto

150
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,440
plagiarized from the Christchurch guy.

151
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,980
He had a history of neo-nazi rhetoric online, and he had withdrawn from his family and his

152
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,340
school and his life.

153
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,580
Salvador Ramos, the Uvalde school shooter who crashed his car in an attempt to get to

154
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
his target.

155
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,260
He came from a broken home, and eventually moved in with his grandmother, who he fought

156
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,840
with over his failure to graduate.

157
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,780
Robert Cremo, the Highland Park shooter who opened fire into a 4th of July celebration

158
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,320
in a Jewish neighborhood in Chicago.

159
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,240
He hung out on 4chan posting neo-nazi stuff, and he had also failed at a school and had

160
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,680
a deteriorating family life.

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,060
And now, this guy.

162
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,260
Both the mainstream media, and surely most leftoid youtubers and streamers who are talking

163
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,740
about this event, will pin everything on 4chan, edgy internet speech, and neo-nazi radicalization.

164
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,040
But I think they've got it backwards.

165
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,140
I think the Nazi stuff is a symptom of the problem, not the cause.

166
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
Look at these guys.

167
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,500
The joke going around right now is that this picture is the Gen Z physiognomy check.

168
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,860
And yeah, that's pretty funny, at least if you like dark humor.

169
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,460
But I'm reminded more of the bio-Leninism theory that's floating around within neo-reactionary

170
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,700
circles right now.

171
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,780
Leninism was a specific type of socialism developed by Vladimir Lenin.

172
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,820
I spoke a little bit about this in my recent video on the left-hating of farmers.

173
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,080
One of the early practical stages of the implementation of Leninism was rounding up all of the social

174
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,900
rejects who are bitter and angry at the most successful members of their community, give

175
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,100
them weapons, give them the authority of the state, and tell them that their lives were

176
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,540
in shambles because the parasitic kulak, who just so happened to be their more successful

177
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,460
and hardworking neighbor that they were jealous of, was the cause of all of their problems.

178
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,300
A core component of Leninism was a revolution by the rejects of society, the people who

179
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,020
were bitter at everything and everyone because of their own failures.

180
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,500
Bio-Leninism, as theorized by the Anorexors, is the idea that the same process is happening

181
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,940
in the modern day, but this time without the agitation of a socialist party and instead

182
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,500
happening in a quasi-isolated and decentralized manner, and this time not specifically due

183
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,800
to economic failure.

184
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,320
Genetic failure may be a part of it, but so is failure with women, failure at school,

185
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,840
or just general life failure.

186
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,740
The Anorexors believe this is a biological inevitability, that these genetic inferiors

187
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,280
will always constitute a lower class, and if given freedom, will always use it to lash

188
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,760
out at what they deem more reproductively successful than them.

189
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,880
I'm not sure if I agree with that conclusion, but I do think their initial analysis is probably

190
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
correct.

191
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,020
I did a video years and years ago titled, Islamist or incel, where I pointed out that

192
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,880
even as these people commit horrible acts and do genuinely become monsters, they are

193
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,360
also tragic figures, right up until that point of no return.

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,800
The framework that they rely on to commit these acts, whether it's socialism or fascism

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,860
or islamism, that framework isn't the cause of it, ultimately.

196
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,640
Their own collapsing life is.

197
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,120
These frameworks create post hoc justifications for their actions.

198
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,680
People generally don't get sucked into an extremist ideology unless their own engagement

199
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,640
with society has already deteriorated.

200
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,520
In other words, it's revenge against God for the crime of being.

201
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,300
I told you that Jordan Peterson had good ideas, despite his recent weird turn.

202
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,160
Society is set up in such a way that if you engage with its structures properly, you can

203
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
generally get ahead.

204
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
It's not guaranteed.

205
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,260
Some people are better off forging their own path.

206
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,840
Some people don't engage, lie to everybody that they are, and then become bitter due

207
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,180
to their own cowardice.

208
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,800
Some people do genuinely engage, but due to random chances, it doesn't work out for them.

209
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,300
And they too become bitter.

210
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
And you know what?

211
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,260
Surely we've all felt this way at least once in our lives, right?

212
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,640
In fact, based on the comments on my liminal video, I know we all have.

213
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,220
These people could be us had we made different choices during our worst moments.

214
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,540
Where but for the grace of God go we.

215
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
They are monsters.

216
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,180
But I think we would make a fatal mistake to say that their motivations are unknowable,

217
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,880
or that their actions are surprising given the circumstances.

218
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,820
The darkest part of your heart that you've buried for years, it knows exactly what's

219
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
going on here.

220
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,020
And you do too, if you have the strength of character to ask it.
