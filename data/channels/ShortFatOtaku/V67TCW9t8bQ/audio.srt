1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Emma Watson looked shame in the face and won, stunning and brave.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,160
Yeah, this story is floating around right now,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,440
regarding Emma Watson approaching 30 years old while still single.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,800
In an interview she said,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,760
I never believed the whole I'm happy single spiel.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,120
It took me a long time, but I'm very happy being single.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,880
I call it being self-partnered.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,320
Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30?

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,600
This is not a big deal.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,880
But as an actress.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,200
Cut to 29.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,600
And I'm like, oh my God, I feel so stressed and anxious.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,640
And I realise it's because there are,

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
If you, if you do not have a, if you have not built a home,

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,440
if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby,

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,720
and you are turning 30,

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,120
and you're not in some like incredibly like secure, stable place in your career,

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
you're still figuring things out.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,760
There's just like this incredible amount of anxiety.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,880
And you know, fair enough.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
There's nothing wrong with being single.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,880
It's possible to have a fulfilled life without a romantic partner, for sure.

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
But just because it's possible doesn't mean that it's easy or common.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
Sure, for some people, a different life path will lead to lasting happiness.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
And maybe Emma Watson really is one of those exceptional individuals.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
But for most of us, we will eventually need a partner to be fulfilled.

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
Well, not just a partner.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
Obviously it's better to be single than to be in an abusive relationship or something.

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,760
But you know what I mean.

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,840
But this is less about Emma Watson herself,

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,000
and more about what The Guardian is calling the single positivity movement.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,640
More and more people are throwing off outdated stigmas

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
and embracing a happy life on their own.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,480
Well, good for them if they're actually happy,

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,600
but it's not really about outdated stigmas, is it?

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,480
Nonetheless, this article talks about a lot of female celebrities

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,720
who are completely satisfied going without a partner.

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,440
Emma Watson, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Abby Jackson, the list goes on.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,040
The push for a singles positivity movement is coming at the same time

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
as a whole bunch of articles are being published

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,520
about women's dating woes and how it's all men's fault.

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
Women are struggling to find men who make as much money as they do.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,360
The dating gap.

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,720
Why the odds are stacked against female graduates finding a like-minded man.

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
Broke men are hurting American women's marriage prospects.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,320
Oh no!

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, if the single life is truly amazing,

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,000
if the singles positivity movement is to be believed,

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
how can these articles justify what they perceive to be

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,240
the lack of dateable men as a harm?

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
Unless Emma Watson is lying to herself,

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
and subsequently lying to the people who interviewed her,

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,320
it seems like she is legitimately happy being self-partnered at 29.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,080
And for the sake of this video, let's take her at face value on this.

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
But let's also discuss a celebrity that is not happy about it.

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,640
Charlize Theron says she wants somebody to step up and date her.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,600
I've been single for 10 years. It's not a long shot.

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,200
Somebody just needs to grow a pair and step up, Charlize Theron said.

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm shockingly available.

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,700
Oof.

62
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,580
Doesn't sound like she's happy with a single life anymore.

63
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,780
Here's the kicker though.

64
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,980
When Emma Watson or whoever comes out as self-partnered,

65
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,940
when a woman says she specifically does not want a relationship,

66
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,260
it's framed as singles positivity.

67
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,860
It's about casting off the shackles of outdated stigmas and such.

68
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,700
What about when a man does it?

69
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,980
Well, that makes them a MGTOW, a man going their own way.

70
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,060
The MGTOW philosophy, as I understand it,

71
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,340
is the idea that men are checking out of the dating scene entirely.

72
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,980
Sometimes because they just don't value a relationship.

73
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,820
Sometimes because they don't believe a relationship is worth the risk or the hassle.

74
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,900
Sometimes it's because they're actually misogynists,

75
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,620
though I think this reason is pretty rare overall.

76
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,620
If you asked radical feminists though, they'd claim that as the only reason,

77
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,340
and that MGTOWs, MRAs, and pickup artists were all simply misogynist patriarchs,

78
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,900
even though pickup artists directly engage in the sexual marketplace specifically to game it,

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,940
believing that MGTOWs are cowards for checking out of it entirely,

80
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,380
and MRAs are pussies for wanting to change what they see as the rules of the game.

81
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,740
Oh well, I guess it's easier for the radfems to just assume all of these

82
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,820
disparate groups opposed to them are united despite being ideologically separate.

83
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,420
Anyway, if Emma Watson and the singles positivity brigade are the female mirror of the MGTOWs,

84
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,540
then Charlize Theron's somebody-needs-to-step-up problem is a female mirror of the incels.

85
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,820
You know, the incels, the lonely unattractive men at the bottom of the totem pole,

86
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,820
the people who are so maligned they've retreated into their online echo chambers and safe spaces,

87
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,620
which the media subsequently labels as hotbeds of misogyny.

88
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,820
The people that the rest of society are really afraid of right now because they

89
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,660
seem to be a bit of a powder keg, with multiple shootings already under their belts.

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,020
When you really boil it down, though, the incels are a group of men who are

91
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,020
depressed because they can't find girlfriends.

92
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,340
That sounds like the equivalent of Charlize I'm Shockingly Available Theron to me.

93
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,660
When men can't find girlfriends, they're treated like they've committed some vile crime,

94
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,900
even if they actually haven't shot anyone up yet.

95
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,820
But when women can't find boyfriends, it's treated like she's the victim.

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,780
Oh no, this poor innocent woman can't find a good man.

97
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,420
But in the end, the actual event is the same.

98
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,020
Somebody who can't find a mate.

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,060
Ellen Pao famously and stupidly tweeted,

100
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,100
CEOs of big tech companies, you almost certainly have incels as employees.

101
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,620
What are you going to do about it?

102
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,380
As if being a man who can't get laid was the same thing as being guilty of a crime.

103
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,700
Imagine the outrage if somebody demanded big tech CEOs monitor the sexual activities of female

104
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,220
employees and asked what are you going to do about it if it was determined they weren't having

105
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,020
enough sex.

106
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,580
It would be virgin shaming of the highest order.

107
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,700
In fact, I think that's why Ellen said incels and not virgins.

108
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,900
She's smart enough to understand that while both labels refer to shaming people for the

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,180
lack of sexual experience, one is almost exclusively used to describe men and is therefore fair game.

110
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,020
And that's what this boils down to.

111
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,780
Charlize Theron's problem is not considered to be the same as the incels problem,

112
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,820
even though they're quite similar, solely because she's a woman.

113
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,740
MGTOWs are problematic, while Emma Watson is empowered because she's a woman.

114
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,060
At one time in our past, sexual norms dictated that older male bachelors were acceptable

115
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,300
oddities, while older female bachelorettes were unattractive, pitiable spinsters.

116
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,380
The sexual equality line we were all fed led us to believe that the objective was to simply

117
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,140
grant everyone the freedom to do what they like, a goal that I personally agree with.

118
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,460
But instead, we all had the wool pulled over our eyes.

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,340
The sexual norms were not equalized, they were simply reversed.

120
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,860
To progressives, female bachelorettes are now proud independent women who have bucked

121
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,020
society's expectations and are bravely forging a new path to lifelong happiness,

122
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,700
while male bachelors are deserving of fear mongering, mockery, and pity.

123
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,940
And, weirdly enough, homophobia as well.

124
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,820
Because the only reason a man would ever reject a woman to her face is because he's gay, obviously.

125
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,620
But you know, maybe there's another way to conceptualize this whole thing.

126
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,420
Because after all, even as Charlize Theron wants a relationship, she still doesn't want marriage.

127
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,060
Not tying the knot is innately her truth.

128
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,380
Meanwhile, back in that CNN article, Emma Watson does say that it took her a long time

129
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,780
to be very happy with being single, almost as if she had to talk herself into it over time.

130
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,060
Maybe I've got this all wrong.

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,660
Maybe Emma and Charlize actually aren't that different after all.

132
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,220
Maybe it's more like, being single does come with some benefits over being partnered,

133
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,620
and it is possible to be happy living a single life.

134
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,660
But that doesn't mean that it's better than being in a committed relationship.

135
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,940
And maybe all these women fluctuate between wanting a relationship and not,

136
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,500
because they operate under the mistaken belief that they can have it all.

137
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,420
And all necessarily includes the benefits of two contradictory existences.

138
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,980
Well, the hard truth is, women can't have it all.

139
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,540
Because contrary to popular opinion, neither can men.

140
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,780
There's a reason that most people find fulfillment in things like relationships and kids,

141
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,820
while only a small minority of people flourish without them.

142
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,540
Talking in a very general sense, of course, men are more likely to value completeness,

143
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,780
while women are more likely to value wholeness.

144
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,220
Completeness means a total dedication to the perfection of one personal trait.

145
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,220
This would explain the reason that men overwhelmingly make up the top tier of almost every field.

146
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,380
For example, if you're a top tier scientist, you're spending 80 hours a week in your lab,

147
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,860
and that's how you get to edge out every other scientist in the field.

148
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,540
It's the only way you get to do it.

149
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,460
You operate unidimensionally and sacrifice everything else to this one virtue.

150
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,260
Meanwhile, that wholeness that women are more likely to value

151
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,500
refers to not the perfection of one trait,

152
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,380
but the juggling of many traits of roughly equal importance.

153
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,180
They don't get to operate any one of them to a level of near perfection,

154
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,860
because there's just not enough time in the day.

155
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,660
But they do get to have a more balanced life overall.

156
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,540
This would explain why women prefer not to take excessive amounts of overtime,

157
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,340
or why they prefer to cultivate a relationship and have children,

158
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,980
or why they rarely exist at the top tier of any field,

159
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,140
and frankly, why they live longer.

160
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,340
It's a healthier way to live your life, even though it's not hyperproductive.

161
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,980
Again, I'm obviously talking in very general terms.

162
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,300
But my point is, men don't have it all.

163
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,500
We have always understood the necessity of sacrificing a family life

164
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,420
in order to be able to provide for that family,

165
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,260
and our civilization probably wouldn't exist without men everywhere making that sacrifice.

166
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Meanwhile, women chasing the dream of having it all seems to be absolutely destroying them.

167
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,540
That's a more generalized sentiment, though, relating not just to relationships,

168
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,860
but also work and pay and many other things.

169
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,940
In terms of just the relationship game, let me leave you with this.

170
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,700
If it is the case that Emma Watson and Charlize Theron hold opposing positions,

171
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,340
then it is telling how well society treats them in comparison to their male counterparts.

172
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,900
Emma Watson's admission sparks a singles movement,

173
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,140
while single men are treated with hostility and suspicion.

174
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,420
Charlize Theron is a victim of the lack of available men,

175
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,900
while incels are the victimizers of women, even as they both simply desire a relationship.

176
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,500
But if Emma and Charlize are actually more similar than they initially let on,

177
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,820
if they actually desire a relationship but nonetheless feel an urge to not desire it,

178
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,260
I would frankly chalk that up to something approximating feminist conditioning.

179
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,340
You keep hearing about this kind of thing all the time.

180
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,020
Articles about how women miss catcalling even though they know it's objectifying.

181
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,660
Women feeling guilty about their sexual fantasies because they

182
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,940
involve a voluntary loss of their own agency, stuff like that.

183
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,100
And I think that type of thinking has taken hold specifically because of that desire for wholeness.

184
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,020
Desire to have a bunch of different things at once, even if they're contradictory.

185
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,260
Maybe this idea even explains the whole

186
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,780
Beta Orbiter friendzone game that some especially trashy women play.

187
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,900
You know, where they string on multiple men at once just to have backups.

188
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,860
Who knows?

189
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,860
And hey, Emma, don't worry about the whole self-partnering thing.

190
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,500
Because if there's one thing I've learned about people who marry themselves,

191
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,340
it's that they also cheat on themselves.

192
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,060
But in the end, if ten years down the road,

193
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,940
you ever find yourself asking where have all the good men gone?

194
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,460
Here's the answer for you.

195
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,700
The good men have gone to marry the good women.

196
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
You are just not one of those good women,

197
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,420
the same way that incels are often not one of the good men.
