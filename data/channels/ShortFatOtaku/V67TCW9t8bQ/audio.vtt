00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
Emma Watson looked shame in the face and won, stunning and brave.

00:04.160 --> 00:06.160
Yeah, this story is floating around right now,

00:06.160 --> 00:09.440
regarding Emma Watson approaching 30 years old while still single.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.800
In an interview she said,

00:10.800 --> 00:13.760
I never believed the whole I'm happy single spiel.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.120
It took me a long time, but I'm very happy being single.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.880
I call it being self-partnered.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.320
Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30?

00:22.320 --> 00:23.600
This is not a big deal.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.880
But as an actress.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.200
Cut to 29.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.600
And I'm like, oh my God, I feel so stressed and anxious.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.640
And I realise it's because there are,

00:34.640 --> 00:38.960
there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.520
If you, if you do not have a, if you have not built a home,

00:44.080 --> 00:47.440
if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby,

00:47.440 --> 00:48.720
and you are turning 30,

00:49.760 --> 00:55.120
and you're not in some like incredibly like secure, stable place in your career,

00:55.120 --> 00:56.480
you're still figuring things out.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.760
There's just like this incredible amount of anxiety.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.880
And you know, fair enough.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.440
There's nothing wrong with being single.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.880
It's possible to have a fulfilled life without a romantic partner, for sure.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.640
But just because it's possible doesn't mean that it's easy or common.

01:10.640 --> 01:14.560
Sure, for some people, a different life path will lead to lasting happiness.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.600
And maybe Emma Watson really is one of those exceptional individuals.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.520
But for most of us, we will eventually need a partner to be fulfilled.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.200
Well, not just a partner.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.640
Obviously it's better to be single than to be in an abusive relationship or something.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.760
But you know what I mean.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.840
But this is less about Emma Watson herself,

01:29.840 --> 01:34.000
and more about what The Guardian is calling the single positivity movement.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.640
More and more people are throwing off outdated stigmas

01:36.640 --> 01:38.640
and embracing a happy life on their own.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.480
Well, good for them if they're actually happy,

01:40.480 --> 01:43.600
but it's not really about outdated stigmas, is it?

01:43.600 --> 01:46.480
Nonetheless, this article talks about a lot of female celebrities

01:46.480 --> 01:48.720
who are completely satisfied going without a partner.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.440
Emma Watson, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Abby Jackson, the list goes on.

01:53.440 --> 01:57.040
The push for a singles positivity movement is coming at the same time

01:57.040 --> 01:58.880
as a whole bunch of articles are being published

01:58.880 --> 02:01.520
about women's dating woes and how it's all men's fault.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.560
Women are struggling to find men who make as much money as they do.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.360
The dating gap.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.720
Why the odds are stacked against female graduates finding a like-minded man.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.440
Broke men are hurting American women's marriage prospects.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.320
Oh no!

02:12.320 --> 02:15.040
Well, if the single life is truly amazing,

02:15.040 --> 02:18.000
if the singles positivity movement is to be believed,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.160
how can these articles justify what they perceive to be

02:20.160 --> 02:22.240
the lack of dateable men as a harm?

02:23.520 --> 02:25.680
Unless Emma Watson is lying to herself,

02:25.680 --> 02:28.160
and subsequently lying to the people who interviewed her,

02:28.160 --> 02:32.320
it seems like she is legitimately happy being self-partnered at 29.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.080
And for the sake of this video, let's take her at face value on this.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.040
But let's also discuss a celebrity that is not happy about it.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.640
Charlize Theron says she wants somebody to step up and date her.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.600
I've been single for 10 years. It's not a long shot.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.200
Somebody just needs to grow a pair and step up, Charlize Theron said.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.640
I'm shockingly available.

02:51.200 --> 02:51.700
Oof.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.580
Doesn't sound like she's happy with a single life anymore.

02:54.580 --> 02:55.780
Here's the kicker though.

02:55.780 --> 02:58.980
When Emma Watson or whoever comes out as self-partnered,

02:58.980 --> 03:01.940
when a woman says she specifically does not want a relationship,

03:01.940 --> 03:04.260
it's framed as singles positivity.

03:04.260 --> 03:07.860
It's about casting off the shackles of outdated stigmas and such.

03:07.860 --> 03:09.700
What about when a man does it?

03:09.700 --> 03:12.980
Well, that makes them a MGTOW, a man going their own way.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.060
The MGTOW philosophy, as I understand it,

03:15.060 --> 03:18.340
is the idea that men are checking out of the dating scene entirely.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.980
Sometimes because they just don't value a relationship.

03:20.980 --> 03:24.820
Sometimes because they don't believe a relationship is worth the risk or the hassle.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.900
Sometimes it's because they're actually misogynists,

03:26.900 --> 03:29.620
though I think this reason is pretty rare overall.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.620
If you asked radical feminists though, they'd claim that as the only reason,

03:33.620 --> 03:38.340
and that MGTOWs, MRAs, and pickup artists were all simply misogynist patriarchs,

03:38.340 --> 03:42.900
even though pickup artists directly engage in the sexual marketplace specifically to game it,

03:42.900 --> 03:45.940
believing that MGTOWs are cowards for checking out of it entirely,

03:45.940 --> 03:49.380
and MRAs are pussies for wanting to change what they see as the rules of the game.

03:49.380 --> 03:52.740
Oh well, I guess it's easier for the radfems to just assume all of these

03:52.740 --> 03:56.820
disparate groups opposed to them are united despite being ideologically separate.

03:56.820 --> 04:02.420
Anyway, if Emma Watson and the singles positivity brigade are the female mirror of the MGTOWs,

04:02.420 --> 04:07.540
then Charlize Theron's somebody-needs-to-step-up problem is a female mirror of the incels.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.820
You know, the incels, the lonely unattractive men at the bottom of the totem pole,

04:10.820 --> 04:14.820
the people who are so maligned they've retreated into their online echo chambers and safe spaces,

04:14.820 --> 04:17.620
which the media subsequently labels as hotbeds of misogyny.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.820
The people that the rest of society are really afraid of right now because they

04:20.820 --> 04:24.660
seem to be a bit of a powder keg, with multiple shootings already under their belts.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.020
When you really boil it down, though, the incels are a group of men who are

04:28.020 --> 04:30.020
depressed because they can't find girlfriends.

04:30.020 --> 04:34.340
That sounds like the equivalent of Charlize I'm Shockingly Available Theron to me.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.660
When men can't find girlfriends, they're treated like they've committed some vile crime,

04:38.660 --> 04:40.900
even if they actually haven't shot anyone up yet.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.820
But when women can't find boyfriends, it's treated like she's the victim.

04:44.820 --> 04:47.780
Oh no, this poor innocent woman can't find a good man.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.420
But in the end, the actual event is the same.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.020
Somebody who can't find a mate.

04:52.020 --> 04:55.060
Ellen Pao famously and stupidly tweeted,

04:55.060 --> 05:00.100
CEOs of big tech companies, you almost certainly have incels as employees.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.620
What are you going to do about it?

05:01.620 --> 05:05.380
As if being a man who can't get laid was the same thing as being guilty of a crime.

05:06.180 --> 05:11.700
Imagine the outrage if somebody demanded big tech CEOs monitor the sexual activities of female

05:11.700 --> 05:15.220
employees and asked what are you going to do about it if it was determined they weren't having

05:15.220 --> 05:16.020
enough sex.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.580
It would be virgin shaming of the highest order.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.700
In fact, I think that's why Ellen said incels and not virgins.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.900
She's smart enough to understand that while both labels refer to shaming people for the

05:24.900 --> 05:30.180
lack of sexual experience, one is almost exclusively used to describe men and is therefore fair game.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.020
And that's what this boils down to.

05:32.020 --> 05:35.780
Charlize Theron's problem is not considered to be the same as the incels problem,

05:35.780 --> 05:38.820
even though they're quite similar, solely because she's a woman.

05:38.820 --> 05:42.740
MGTOWs are problematic, while Emma Watson is empowered because she's a woman.

05:42.740 --> 05:47.060
At one time in our past, sexual norms dictated that older male bachelors were acceptable

05:47.060 --> 05:51.300
oddities, while older female bachelorettes were unattractive, pitiable spinsters.

05:51.300 --> 05:55.380
The sexual equality line we were all fed led us to believe that the objective was to simply

05:55.380 --> 05:59.140
grant everyone the freedom to do what they like, a goal that I personally agree with.

05:59.140 --> 06:01.460
But instead, we all had the wool pulled over our eyes.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.340
The sexual norms were not equalized, they were simply reversed.

06:04.340 --> 06:07.860
To progressives, female bachelorettes are now proud independent women who have bucked

06:07.860 --> 06:12.020
society's expectations and are bravely forging a new path to lifelong happiness,

06:12.020 --> 06:15.700
while male bachelors are deserving of fear mongering, mockery, and pity.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.940
And, weirdly enough, homophobia as well.

06:17.940 --> 06:22.820
Because the only reason a man would ever reject a woman to her face is because he's gay, obviously.

06:22.820 --> 06:25.620
But you know, maybe there's another way to conceptualize this whole thing.

06:25.620 --> 06:30.420
Because after all, even as Charlize Theron wants a relationship, she still doesn't want marriage.

06:30.420 --> 06:33.060
Not tying the knot is innately her truth.

06:33.060 --> 06:37.380
Meanwhile, back in that CNN article, Emma Watson does say that it took her a long time

06:37.380 --> 06:41.780
to be very happy with being single, almost as if she had to talk herself into it over time.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.060
Maybe I've got this all wrong.

06:43.060 --> 06:46.660
Maybe Emma and Charlize actually aren't that different after all.

06:46.660 --> 06:51.220
Maybe it's more like, being single does come with some benefits over being partnered,

06:51.220 --> 06:53.620
and it is possible to be happy living a single life.

06:53.620 --> 06:56.660
But that doesn't mean that it's better than being in a committed relationship.

06:56.660 --> 06:59.940
And maybe all these women fluctuate between wanting a relationship and not,

06:59.940 --> 07:02.500
because they operate under the mistaken belief that they can have it all.

07:02.500 --> 07:06.420
And all necessarily includes the benefits of two contradictory existences.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.980
Well, the hard truth is, women can't have it all.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.540
Because contrary to popular opinion, neither can men.

07:11.540 --> 07:15.780
There's a reason that most people find fulfillment in things like relationships and kids,

07:15.780 --> 07:18.820
while only a small minority of people flourish without them.

07:18.820 --> 07:23.540
Talking in a very general sense, of course, men are more likely to value completeness,

07:23.540 --> 07:25.780
while women are more likely to value wholeness.

07:25.780 --> 07:29.220
Completeness means a total dedication to the perfection of one personal trait.

07:29.220 --> 07:33.220
This would explain the reason that men overwhelmingly make up the top tier of almost every field.

07:33.220 --> 07:37.380
For example, if you're a top tier scientist, you're spending 80 hours a week in your lab,

07:37.380 --> 07:39.860
and that's how you get to edge out every other scientist in the field.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.540
It's the only way you get to do it.

07:41.540 --> 07:45.460
You operate unidimensionally and sacrifice everything else to this one virtue.

07:45.460 --> 07:48.260
Meanwhile, that wholeness that women are more likely to value

07:48.260 --> 07:50.500
refers to not the perfection of one trait,

07:50.500 --> 07:53.380
but the juggling of many traits of roughly equal importance.

07:53.380 --> 07:56.180
They don't get to operate any one of them to a level of near perfection,

07:56.180 --> 07:57.860
because there's just not enough time in the day.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.660
But they do get to have a more balanced life overall.

08:00.660 --> 08:03.540
This would explain why women prefer not to take excessive amounts of overtime,

08:03.540 --> 08:06.340
or why they prefer to cultivate a relationship and have children,

08:06.340 --> 08:08.980
or why they rarely exist at the top tier of any field,

08:08.980 --> 08:11.140
and frankly, why they live longer.

08:11.140 --> 08:14.340
It's a healthier way to live your life, even though it's not hyperproductive.

08:14.340 --> 08:16.980
Again, I'm obviously talking in very general terms.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.300
But my point is, men don't have it all.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.500
We have always understood the necessity of sacrificing a family life

08:22.500 --> 08:24.420
in order to be able to provide for that family,

08:24.420 --> 08:28.260
and our civilization probably wouldn't exist without men everywhere making that sacrifice.

08:28.260 --> 08:32.260
Meanwhile, women chasing the dream of having it all seems to be absolutely destroying them.

08:32.260 --> 08:35.540
That's a more generalized sentiment, though, relating not just to relationships,

08:35.540 --> 08:37.860
but also work and pay and many other things.

08:38.580 --> 08:41.940
In terms of just the relationship game, let me leave you with this.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.700
If it is the case that Emma Watson and Charlize Theron hold opposing positions,

08:45.700 --> 08:50.340
then it is telling how well society treats them in comparison to their male counterparts.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.900
Emma Watson's admission sparks a singles movement,

08:52.900 --> 08:55.140
while single men are treated with hostility and suspicion.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.420
Charlize Theron is a victim of the lack of available men,

08:58.420 --> 09:02.900
while incels are the victimizers of women, even as they both simply desire a relationship.

09:02.900 --> 09:06.500
But if Emma and Charlize are actually more similar than they initially let on,

09:06.500 --> 09:10.820
if they actually desire a relationship but nonetheless feel an urge to not desire it,

09:10.820 --> 09:14.260
I would frankly chalk that up to something approximating feminist conditioning.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.340
You keep hearing about this kind of thing all the time.

09:16.340 --> 09:20.020
Articles about how women miss catcalling even though they know it's objectifying.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.660
Women feeling guilty about their sexual fantasies because they

09:22.660 --> 09:25.940
involve a voluntary loss of their own agency, stuff like that.

09:25.940 --> 09:30.100
And I think that type of thinking has taken hold specifically because of that desire for wholeness.

09:30.660 --> 09:34.020
Desire to have a bunch of different things at once, even if they're contradictory.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.260
Maybe this idea even explains the whole

09:36.260 --> 09:39.780
Beta Orbiter friendzone game that some especially trashy women play.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.900
You know, where they string on multiple men at once just to have backups.

09:42.900 --> 09:43.860
Who knows?

09:43.860 --> 09:47.860
And hey, Emma, don't worry about the whole self-partnering thing.

09:47.860 --> 09:50.500
Because if there's one thing I've learned about people who marry themselves,

09:50.500 --> 09:52.340
it's that they also cheat on themselves.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.060
But in the end, if ten years down the road,

09:55.060 --> 09:57.940
you ever find yourself asking where have all the good men gone?

09:57.940 --> 09:59.460
Here's the answer for you.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.700
The good men have gone to marry the good women.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.700
You are just not one of those good women,

10:03.700 --> 10:06.420
the same way that incels are often not one of the good men.
