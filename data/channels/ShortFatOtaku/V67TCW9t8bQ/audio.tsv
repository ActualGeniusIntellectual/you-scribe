0	4160	Emma Watson looked shame in the face and won, stunning and brave.
4160	6160	Yeah, this story is floating around right now,
6160	9440	regarding Emma Watson approaching 30 years old while still single.
9440	10800	In an interview she said,
10800	13760	I never believed the whole I'm happy single spiel.
13760	17120	It took me a long time, but I'm very happy being single.
17120	18880	I call it being self-partnered.
19520	22320	Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30?
22320	23600	This is not a big deal.
23600	24880	But as an actress.
24880	27200	Cut to 29.
27840	31600	And I'm like, oh my God, I feel so stressed and anxious.
32240	34640	And I realise it's because there are,
34640	38960	there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around.
39520	43520	If you, if you do not have a, if you have not built a home,
44080	47440	if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby,
47440	48720	and you are turning 30,
49760	55120	and you're not in some like incredibly like secure, stable place in your career,
55120	56480	you're still figuring things out.
57280	59760	There's just like this incredible amount of anxiety.
59760	60880	And you know, fair enough.
61440	63440	There's nothing wrong with being single.
63440	66880	It's possible to have a fulfilled life without a romantic partner, for sure.
66880	70640	But just because it's possible doesn't mean that it's easy or common.
70640	74560	Sure, for some people, a different life path will lead to lasting happiness.
74560	77600	And maybe Emma Watson really is one of those exceptional individuals.
77600	81520	But for most of us, we will eventually need a partner to be fulfilled.
81520	83200	Well, not just a partner.
83200	86640	Obviously it's better to be single than to be in an abusive relationship or something.
86640	87760	But you know what I mean.
87760	89840	But this is less about Emma Watson herself,
89840	94000	and more about what The Guardian is calling the single positivity movement.
94000	96640	More and more people are throwing off outdated stigmas
96640	98640	and embracing a happy life on their own.
98640	100480	Well, good for them if they're actually happy,
100480	103600	but it's not really about outdated stigmas, is it?
103600	106480	Nonetheless, this article talks about a lot of female celebrities
106480	108720	who are completely satisfied going without a partner.
108720	113440	Emma Watson, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Abby Jackson, the list goes on.
113440	117040	The push for a singles positivity movement is coming at the same time
117040	118880	as a whole bunch of articles are being published
118880	121520	about women's dating woes and how it's all men's fault.
121520	124560	Women are struggling to find men who make as much money as they do.
124560	125360	The dating gap.
125360	128720	Why the odds are stacked against female graduates finding a like-minded man.
128720	131440	Broke men are hurting American women's marriage prospects.
131440	132320	Oh no!
132320	135040	Well, if the single life is truly amazing,
135040	138000	if the singles positivity movement is to be believed,
138000	140160	how can these articles justify what they perceive to be
140160	142240	the lack of dateable men as a harm?
143520	145680	Unless Emma Watson is lying to herself,
145680	148160	and subsequently lying to the people who interviewed her,
148160	152320	it seems like she is legitimately happy being self-partnered at 29.
152320	156080	And for the sake of this video, let's take her at face value on this.
156080	159040	But let's also discuss a celebrity that is not happy about it.
159040	162640	Charlize Theron says she wants somebody to step up and date her.
162640	165600	I've been single for 10 years. It's not a long shot.
165600	169200	Somebody just needs to grow a pair and step up, Charlize Theron said.
169200	170640	I'm shockingly available.
171200	171700	Oof.
172100	174580	Doesn't sound like she's happy with a single life anymore.
174580	175780	Here's the kicker though.
175780	178980	When Emma Watson or whoever comes out as self-partnered,
178980	181940	when a woman says she specifically does not want a relationship,
181940	184260	it's framed as singles positivity.
184260	187860	It's about casting off the shackles of outdated stigmas and such.
187860	189700	What about when a man does it?
189700	192980	Well, that makes them a MGTOW, a man going their own way.
192980	195060	The MGTOW philosophy, as I understand it,
195060	198340	is the idea that men are checking out of the dating scene entirely.
198340	200980	Sometimes because they just don't value a relationship.
200980	204820	Sometimes because they don't believe a relationship is worth the risk or the hassle.
204820	206900	Sometimes it's because they're actually misogynists,
206900	209620	though I think this reason is pretty rare overall.
209620	213620	If you asked radical feminists though, they'd claim that as the only reason,
213620	218340	and that MGTOWs, MRAs, and pickup artists were all simply misogynist patriarchs,
218340	222900	even though pickup artists directly engage in the sexual marketplace specifically to game it,
222900	225940	believing that MGTOWs are cowards for checking out of it entirely,
225940	229380	and MRAs are pussies for wanting to change what they see as the rules of the game.
229380	232740	Oh well, I guess it's easier for the radfems to just assume all of these
232740	236820	disparate groups opposed to them are united despite being ideologically separate.
236820	242420	Anyway, if Emma Watson and the singles positivity brigade are the female mirror of the MGTOWs,
242420	247540	then Charlize Theron's somebody-needs-to-step-up problem is a female mirror of the incels.
247540	250820	You know, the incels, the lonely unattractive men at the bottom of the totem pole,
250820	254820	the people who are so maligned they've retreated into their online echo chambers and safe spaces,
254820	257620	which the media subsequently labels as hotbeds of misogyny.
257620	260820	The people that the rest of society are really afraid of right now because they
260820	264660	seem to be a bit of a powder keg, with multiple shootings already under their belts.
264660	268020	When you really boil it down, though, the incels are a group of men who are
268020	270020	depressed because they can't find girlfriends.
270020	274340	That sounds like the equivalent of Charlize I'm Shockingly Available Theron to me.
274340	278660	When men can't find girlfriends, they're treated like they've committed some vile crime,
278660	280900	even if they actually haven't shot anyone up yet.
280900	284820	But when women can't find boyfriends, it's treated like she's the victim.
284820	287780	Oh no, this poor innocent woman can't find a good man.
287780	290420	But in the end, the actual event is the same.
290420	292020	Somebody who can't find a mate.
292020	295060	Ellen Pao famously and stupidly tweeted,
295060	300100	CEOs of big tech companies, you almost certainly have incels as employees.
300100	301620	What are you going to do about it?
301620	305380	As if being a man who can't get laid was the same thing as being guilty of a crime.
306180	311700	Imagine the outrage if somebody demanded big tech CEOs monitor the sexual activities of female
311700	315220	employees and asked what are you going to do about it if it was determined they weren't having
315220	316020	enough sex.
316020	318580	It would be virgin shaming of the highest order.
318580	321700	In fact, I think that's why Ellen said incels and not virgins.
321700	324900	She's smart enough to understand that while both labels refer to shaming people for the
324900	330180	lack of sexual experience, one is almost exclusively used to describe men and is therefore fair game.
330180	332020	And that's what this boils down to.
332020	335780	Charlize Theron's problem is not considered to be the same as the incels problem,
335780	338820	even though they're quite similar, solely because she's a woman.
338820	342740	MGTOWs are problematic, while Emma Watson is empowered because she's a woman.
342740	347060	At one time in our past, sexual norms dictated that older male bachelors were acceptable
347060	351300	oddities, while older female bachelorettes were unattractive, pitiable spinsters.
351300	355380	The sexual equality line we were all fed led us to believe that the objective was to simply
355380	359140	grant everyone the freedom to do what they like, a goal that I personally agree with.
359140	361460	But instead, we all had the wool pulled over our eyes.
361460	364340	The sexual norms were not equalized, they were simply reversed.
364340	367860	To progressives, female bachelorettes are now proud independent women who have bucked
367860	372020	society's expectations and are bravely forging a new path to lifelong happiness,
372020	375700	while male bachelors are deserving of fear mongering, mockery, and pity.
375700	377940	And, weirdly enough, homophobia as well.
377940	382820	Because the only reason a man would ever reject a woman to her face is because he's gay, obviously.
382820	385620	But you know, maybe there's another way to conceptualize this whole thing.
385620	390420	Because after all, even as Charlize Theron wants a relationship, she still doesn't want marriage.
390420	393060	Not tying the knot is innately her truth.
393060	397380	Meanwhile, back in that CNN article, Emma Watson does say that it took her a long time
397380	401780	to be very happy with being single, almost as if she had to talk herself into it over time.
401780	403060	Maybe I've got this all wrong.
403060	406660	Maybe Emma and Charlize actually aren't that different after all.
406660	411220	Maybe it's more like, being single does come with some benefits over being partnered,
411220	413620	and it is possible to be happy living a single life.
413620	416660	But that doesn't mean that it's better than being in a committed relationship.
416660	419940	And maybe all these women fluctuate between wanting a relationship and not,
419940	422500	because they operate under the mistaken belief that they can have it all.
422500	426420	And all necessarily includes the benefits of two contradictory existences.
426420	428980	Well, the hard truth is, women can't have it all.
428980	431540	Because contrary to popular opinion, neither can men.
431540	435780	There's a reason that most people find fulfillment in things like relationships and kids,
435780	438820	while only a small minority of people flourish without them.
438820	443540	Talking in a very general sense, of course, men are more likely to value completeness,
443540	445780	while women are more likely to value wholeness.
445780	449220	Completeness means a total dedication to the perfection of one personal trait.
449220	453220	This would explain the reason that men overwhelmingly make up the top tier of almost every field.
453220	457380	For example, if you're a top tier scientist, you're spending 80 hours a week in your lab,
457380	459860	and that's how you get to edge out every other scientist in the field.
459860	461540	It's the only way you get to do it.
461540	465460	You operate unidimensionally and sacrifice everything else to this one virtue.
465460	468260	Meanwhile, that wholeness that women are more likely to value
468260	470500	refers to not the perfection of one trait,
470500	473380	but the juggling of many traits of roughly equal importance.
473380	476180	They don't get to operate any one of them to a level of near perfection,
476180	477860	because there's just not enough time in the day.
478420	480660	But they do get to have a more balanced life overall.
480660	483540	This would explain why women prefer not to take excessive amounts of overtime,
483540	486340	or why they prefer to cultivate a relationship and have children,
486340	488980	or why they rarely exist at the top tier of any field,
488980	491140	and frankly, why they live longer.
491140	494340	It's a healthier way to live your life, even though it's not hyperproductive.
494340	496980	Again, I'm obviously talking in very general terms.
496980	499300	But my point is, men don't have it all.
499300	502500	We have always understood the necessity of sacrificing a family life
502500	504420	in order to be able to provide for that family,
504420	508260	and our civilization probably wouldn't exist without men everywhere making that sacrifice.
508260	512260	Meanwhile, women chasing the dream of having it all seems to be absolutely destroying them.
512260	515540	That's a more generalized sentiment, though, relating not just to relationships,
515540	517860	but also work and pay and many other things.
518580	521940	In terms of just the relationship game, let me leave you with this.
521940	525700	If it is the case that Emma Watson and Charlize Theron hold opposing positions,
525700	530340	then it is telling how well society treats them in comparison to their male counterparts.
530340	532900	Emma Watson's admission sparks a singles movement,
532900	535140	while single men are treated with hostility and suspicion.
535700	538420	Charlize Theron is a victim of the lack of available men,
538420	542900	while incels are the victimizers of women, even as they both simply desire a relationship.
542900	546500	But if Emma and Charlize are actually more similar than they initially let on,
546500	550820	if they actually desire a relationship but nonetheless feel an urge to not desire it,
550820	554260	I would frankly chalk that up to something approximating feminist conditioning.
554260	556340	You keep hearing about this kind of thing all the time.
556340	560020	Articles about how women miss catcalling even though they know it's objectifying.
560020	562660	Women feeling guilty about their sexual fantasies because they
562660	565940	involve a voluntary loss of their own agency, stuff like that.
565940	570100	And I think that type of thinking has taken hold specifically because of that desire for wholeness.
570660	574020	Desire to have a bunch of different things at once, even if they're contradictory.
574020	576260	Maybe this idea even explains the whole
576260	579780	Beta Orbiter friendzone game that some especially trashy women play.
579780	582900	You know, where they string on multiple men at once just to have backups.
582900	583860	Who knows?
583860	587860	And hey, Emma, don't worry about the whole self-partnering thing.
587860	590500	Because if there's one thing I've learned about people who marry themselves,
590500	592340	it's that they also cheat on themselves.
592420	595060	But in the end, if ten years down the road,
595060	597940	you ever find yourself asking where have all the good men gone?
597940	599460	Here's the answer for you.
599460	601700	The good men have gone to marry the good women.
601700	603700	You are just not one of those good women,
603700	606420	the same way that incels are often not one of the good men.
