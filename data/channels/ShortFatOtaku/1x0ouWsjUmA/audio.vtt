00:00.000 --> 00:11.400
On April 12th, 2018, two African-American men were arrested for loitering in a Starbucks.

00:11.400 --> 00:15.520
This is a topic I covered in detail on my April 22nd video titled Starbucks and the

00:15.520 --> 00:19.240
Belligerents of Black American Subculture, and I recommend you go back and watch that

00:19.240 --> 00:21.480
one before checking this one out, if you haven't already.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.140
And I'd just like to point out, most of the time I choose the title of these videos

00:25.140 --> 00:29.060
after I've completed them, I really didn't think that one was going to be so spicy until

00:29.060 --> 00:30.100
after I'd uploaded it.

00:30.100 --> 00:34.880
In any case, due to this incident, on April 15th, Starbucks released a statement revealing

00:34.880 --> 00:40.160
that all locations would be closed on May 29th for racial bias education training for

00:40.160 --> 00:44.260
approximately 175,000 of the company's American employees.

00:44.260 --> 00:47.400
It would later be revealed that this would not be limited to just the United States and

00:47.400 --> 00:50.420
would include both managers and part-time staff.

00:50.420 --> 00:54.360
Starbucks CEO at the time, Howard Schultz, described the four-hour training course as

00:54.360 --> 00:59.680
just the beginning, offered the two rightfully-arrested men free tuition because they refused to either

00:59.680 --> 01:03.340
make a purchase or leave the establishment when asked, and stated that, "...we're

01:03.340 --> 01:07.100
living in a time in America where there is a fracturing of humanity."

01:07.100 --> 01:11.980
Schultz would almost immediately step down as CEO of Starbucks after this incident, handing

01:11.980 --> 01:15.860
the reins over to Kevin Johnson, who would continue in his predecessor's cuck steps

01:15.860 --> 01:19.180
by personally flying to Philly to apologize to the two arrested men.

01:19.180 --> 01:23.580
Johnson would reiterate Starbucks' commitment to Schultz's diversity training plan stating

01:23.580 --> 01:28.080
that, "...closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey

01:28.080 --> 01:31.680
that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local

01:31.680 --> 01:32.680
communities."

01:32.680 --> 01:37.040
On May 29th, Starbucks locations across the US as well as Canada and other countries did

01:37.040 --> 01:41.120
actually close for this racial bias training, and a viewer of the channel actually has a

01:41.120 --> 01:44.900
partner who is a manager at a Starbucks here in Canada and has provided me with pictures

01:44.900 --> 01:45.900
of the training package.

01:45.900 --> 01:49.380
We'll go over this package in detail a little later, but for now let's see what this

01:49.380 --> 01:51.600
viewer has to say about it from their own mouth.

01:51.620 --> 01:52.620
Hey Dev!

01:52.620 --> 01:55.460
Today is sensitivity training for every Starbucks employee in North America.

01:55.460 --> 01:59.120
I think I've told you before, but my partner works at a Starbucks in Toronto.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.420
Part of her job is doing schedules as well as managing employees.

02:02.420 --> 02:06.980
Expect a lot of stories to come out of this, because people are not happy about this.

02:06.980 --> 02:10.740
Everyone has to take the training on the retail end of Starbucks, and I mean everyone.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.660
Even people who work three jobs are being made to take the training.

02:13.660 --> 02:17.900
My partner's already had tons of people say things like, hey I can't make it but

02:17.900 --> 02:20.580
I'm mixed race so I probably don't need it.

02:20.580 --> 02:24.480
Management is forcing them to reschedule and take the sensitivity training later.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.680
It doesn't matter if you're the blackest, gayest chick in the world, you have to take

02:27.680 --> 02:28.680
it.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.260
I'm surprised to see Starbucks not fold and let black people out of it.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.840
My partner didn't have any recordings, but a lot of this stuff was done through video

02:34.840 --> 02:37.640
files on iPads distributed by Starbucks.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.680
100% chance that those files leak pretty damn fast.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.640
Every store in North America had this lesson, and a lot of employees are pissed.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.120
Even management hates this.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.460
So the way this was presented was everyone was broken off into large groups and asked

02:49.460 --> 02:52.000
to discuss every question as they answered it in the book.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.720
They were presented with a video beforehand that I wish I had on hand to show you, but

02:55.720 --> 02:57.560
my partner couldn't get her hands on it.

02:57.560 --> 03:02.200
Some ridiculous propaganda video showing American civil rights footage and talking about making

03:02.200 --> 03:04.360
America better even though this is Canada.

03:04.360 --> 03:08.560
The booklet also clearly has stuff aimed at black people in it, just without saying black

03:08.560 --> 03:09.560
people.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.580
They were told that Canada would get an adapted version that focuses more on native problems,

03:13.580 --> 03:14.680
but that wasn't true.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.480
Okay, so she just gave me more details and we got a bit of a bombshell.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.740
Starbucks not only wanted the pamphlets back after completion, but they also wanted people's

03:22.740 --> 03:23.740
names on them.

03:23.740 --> 03:26.260
It seems like they wanted to keep records of what people answered.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.960
In fact, Starbucks is still asking for them back.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.940
Some stores were better about getting them back right away, but her store is so big that

03:32.940 --> 03:36.060
the management didn't really give a shit about hounding people down for theirs.

03:36.060 --> 03:40.500
How predictably Orwellian of you, Starbucks, to want everybody to sign their names on their

03:40.500 --> 03:43.580
answer sheets, so you know exactly who is guilty of wrongthink.

03:43.580 --> 03:47.780
And it also sounds like there's a lot of misconduct, misinformation, and mismanagement

03:47.840 --> 03:49.280
of the whole ridiculous program.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.960
But there is one thing that really did stand out to me.

03:51.960 --> 03:56.000
That Starbucks is really, really intent on having all the materials returned to them.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.840
It seems like they may not want it to get out.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.840
And I'm not surprised.

03:58.840 --> 04:03.500
An article in the Daily Mail claims that employees were shown video after video of black people

04:03.500 --> 04:08.660
being abused during racial sensitivity training, while USA Today reported that hip-hop artist

04:08.660 --> 04:12.960
Common was in on the video sections, surely to maximize the cringe factor.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.980
And the centerpiece of the entire presentation was an edited version of the documentary Story

04:17.000 --> 04:18.920
of Access by Stanley Nelson.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.960
Now, all of these videos and iPads described by the person who provided me with this info?

04:22.960 --> 04:27.520
It turns out they're actually all privated videos on Starbucks' YouTube channel.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.160
And the course content for this diversity training program?

04:30.160 --> 04:37.140
It's all online, on the website StarbucksChannel.com, on a buried page inconspicuously titled The

04:37.140 --> 04:38.440
Third Place.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.800
This is just a hunch, I don't have any real evidence for this, but I have a feeling that

04:41.800 --> 04:45.840
Starbucks knew it had to make this information public at some point, but decided to just

04:45.840 --> 04:50.540
quietly publish it on a side site with privated materials in the hopes that nobody would actually

04:50.540 --> 04:51.540
notice.

04:51.540 --> 04:56.900
Thankfully, the SJW ghost town outlet known as Boing Boing stupidly embedded one of the

04:56.900 --> 05:00.780
privated videos into an article, which is how I found all this hidden stuff in the first

05:00.780 --> 05:01.780
place.

05:01.780 --> 05:05.040
A video whose description linked back to The Third Place.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.500
Why do I think they wanted to keep it quiet, though?

05:07.500 --> 05:12.620
Because I've gone over the pamphlet, the videos, and the exam, and oh boy, it is all fucking

05:12.620 --> 05:13.620
ridiculous.

05:13.620 --> 05:14.940
But don't take my word for it.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.200
Let's you and I take this diversity training course for ourselves, shall we?

05:19.200 --> 05:22.760
So here's The Third Place, our commitment renewed.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.920
It says it's a three minute read.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.880
I have a feeling that it's probably not a three minute read.

05:27.880 --> 05:34.720
On May 29th, we closed 8,000 Starbucks stores in the United States for four hours, so 175,000

05:34.720 --> 05:38.600
Starbucks partners could come together for a conversation and learning session on racial

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
bias.

05:39.600 --> 05:44.620
This was a foundational step in renewing Starbucks as a place where all people feel welcome.

05:44.620 --> 05:48.740
Starbucks partners shared life experiences, heard from others, listened to experts on

05:48.740 --> 05:53.920
bias and racial anxiety, reflecting on the realities of bias in our society and talking

05:53.920 --> 05:58.200
about how all of us can work together to create public spaces where everyone feels like they

05:58.200 --> 05:59.200
belong.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.880
When they're talking about racial anxiety, I wonder if they actually brought up white

06:01.880 --> 06:03.140
anxiety?

06:03.140 --> 06:06.800
Our mission, because we want to uplift others, we exist.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.800
No, what?

06:07.800 --> 06:13.640
To inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a

06:14.260 --> 06:19.540
Our values, because we want to deliver on our mission, we show up by creating a culture

06:19.540 --> 06:23.140
of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome, acting with courage, challenging

06:23.140 --> 06:27.940
the status quo and finding new ways to grow our company and each other, being present,

06:27.940 --> 06:31.940
connecting with transparency, dignity, and respect, delivering our very best in all we

06:31.940 --> 06:34.860
do, holding ourselves accountable for results.

06:34.860 --> 06:39.580
So far, this just seems like a regular training bullshit program that you have to go through

06:39.580 --> 06:43.220
any time you're a new employee, but it does get a bit juicier later.

06:44.120 --> 06:48.360
Our mission and values, ground rules, why we're here today, practice, seeing difference

06:48.360 --> 06:52.760
is positive, who we are, who we aspire to be, practice reflecting on what belonging

06:52.760 --> 07:02.200
feels like, understanding bias, practice becoming color brave, color brave, okay, structural

07:02.200 --> 07:09.060
bias, practice envisioning belonging, making every customer feel they belong, practice,

07:09.060 --> 07:15.840
see, respect, uplift, commitments, practice building new habits, okay, well, here's the

07:15.840 --> 07:20.240
team guidebook, this guidebook was designed for groups of three to five Starbucks partners

07:20.240 --> 07:23.880
to work through the relaying session at their own pace, okay, so basically what ended up

07:23.880 --> 07:28.080
happening is they got groups of people together, they gave them an iPad and a team guidebook

07:28.080 --> 07:32.080
and they had to basically follow a four hour training program and let's take a look at

07:32.080 --> 07:33.080
this guidebook.

07:33.080 --> 07:38.440
The first couple pages just seem to be the preamble redone, so there's 68 pages to this

07:38.500 --> 07:45.620
thing, Jesus, okay, let's scroll through this here, there's our mission, the agenda, okay,

07:45.620 --> 07:49.460
working together today, get into groups of three to five people, team up with people

07:49.460 --> 07:54.940
you don't work closely with every day, team guidebook, one per team, iPad, please share

07:54.940 --> 08:01.460
and be patient, come on now kids, you have to share and my notebook is 100% private except

08:01.460 --> 08:05.380
when you hand in the my notebook to Starbucks management but we will get to the my notebook

08:05.380 --> 08:12.000
section later, how to set up your iPad, find an available iPad, place it on the white rectangle

08:12.000 --> 08:21.200
above, turn it on, so like they want you to actually insert the iPad into the book, okay,

08:21.200 --> 08:25.680
also you have to lift the iPad to turn the page and it tells you right here, lift the

08:25.680 --> 08:33.440
iPad, turn the page, so okay, let's keep going, ground rules, listen respectfully, speak your

08:33.440 --> 08:39.960
truth and honour other people's truth, I'm not sure if they know the meaning of the word

08:39.960 --> 08:46.080
truth, if your conversations get off track, pause and restart, yeah, don't have your own

08:46.080 --> 08:50.880
thoughts here guys, just follow along, tips for getting back on track, say what you want

08:50.880 --> 08:54.820
to pause, share what you're feeling, talk about it, in your working group for today

08:54.820 --> 08:59.840
acknowledge it, we hear you, we hear you, we can't create a culture of warmth and belonging

08:59.840 --> 09:03.400
if we don't first acknowledge that some of us deal with negative stereotypes every day,

09:03.400 --> 09:07.160
we hear you, we can't connect with dignity and respect if we don't respect the different

09:07.160 --> 09:11.760
starting points we all had in life, write it down in your notebook and revisit it later,

09:11.760 --> 09:17.000
okay, this really feels like a grade 3 or a grade 4 social studies class man, video

09:17.000 --> 09:25.080
1, Starbucks EVP Rosanne Williams, I'm showing your respect today, instructions, put an iPad

09:25.080 --> 09:29.440
above, select video 1 on the iPad, so they want you to actually place the iPad in the

09:29.440 --> 09:35.760
book and then play the video, I'm actually, I do have the videos down here, let's scroll

09:35.760 --> 09:41.480
down a bit and here's video 1, let's watch it okay, just a YouTube embed, hello partners,

09:41.480 --> 09:45.780
I wanted to share a few thoughts before you begin today, first of all, thank you in advance

09:45.780 --> 09:50.240
for investing your time with one another, this is a needed conversation and one the

09:50.240 --> 09:55.040
Starbucks family is more than capable of having, we are about creating a culture of warmth

09:55.040 --> 10:00.760
and belonging where everyone is welcome, with that in mind, please remember a few things,

10:00.760 --> 10:06.160
first listen respectfully, second speak with your truth and honour the truth of others,

10:06.160 --> 10:10.760
third, if you need to take a moment, feel free to do so, conversations about race can

10:10.760 --> 10:16.340
induce a feeling the experts call racial anxiety and when we're anxious, we can't always think

10:16.340 --> 10:20.760
clearly, if this feeling starts to derail the conversation, there are a few things that

10:20.760 --> 10:26.160
you can do as a group to get back on track, first let the group know you want to pause,

10:26.160 --> 10:30.640
share what you're feeling in the most respectful way possible and then as a group, have a short

10:30.640 --> 10:36.240
conversation about what was shared, remember to be present and listen with respect, this

10:36.240 --> 10:41.320
is about you and your Starbucks family sharing this experience together, if you find you

10:41.320 --> 10:46.100
need more support, please know that additional resources are available and more information

10:46.100 --> 11:01.820
can be found at the bottom of this page in this guidebook, wow, ok, I don't know, racial

11:01.820 --> 11:08.180
anxiety, ok, let's keep going here, why we are here today, this is just a second video

11:08.180 --> 11:12.620
isn't it, yeah it is, Starbucks president and CEO Kevin Johnson, why are we here today,

11:12.620 --> 11:19.660
video 2, video 3, artist, author and activist comment, oh here's the rapper, on making others

11:19.660 --> 11:28.300
feel welcome, ok, ok, ok, so hold on, videos 2 and 3 have to be watched now, let's enjoy

11:28.300 --> 11:35.140
this a little bit, ok, so let us begin, we are here to make Starbucks a place where everyone,

11:35.140 --> 11:41.780
everyone feels welcome, full stop, even if you don't pay guys, you're still welcome,

11:41.780 --> 11:46.180
there is the immediate reason we are gathering, and that is the disheartening situation that

11:46.180 --> 11:53.020
unfolded in Philadelphia, where two young men were arrested in a Starbucks store, but

11:53.020 --> 11:58.020
the issue of racial bias and discrimination isn't just about us as a company, it is about

11:58.020 --> 12:04.980
us as a country, prejudice and public accommodation is deeply rooted in America, and core to our

12:04.980 --> 12:11.560
mission has always been being that third place where everyone feels welcome, but the reality

12:11.560 --> 12:18.040
is being that third place in 2018 is far more challenging, current year, homelessness, substance

12:18.040 --> 12:24.920
abuse in our bathrooms, mental illness, these are all issues that a good portion, substance abuse in

12:24.920 --> 12:30.200
your bathrooms, do you think that's going to get better or worse if you start allowing people in

12:30.200 --> 12:35.320
who haven't bought anything, and you can just let them in, what do you think man, what do you think,

12:35.320 --> 12:41.400
if you face each and every day, yet my hope in gathering us is that Starbucks can become a place

12:41.400 --> 12:48.840
of welcoming, of warmth, and of inclusion for all, now given the state of race relations in this

12:48.840 --> 12:56.720
country, it's easy to wonder if inclusion for all is even possible, here's my belief, growing up this

12:56.720 --> 13:03.480
term called colorblind, described a learning behavior of pretending not to notice race, that

13:03.480 --> 13:11.240
doesn't even make sense, so today we're starting a new journey, talking about race directly, what my

13:11.240 --> 13:19.480
friend and Starbucks board member Melody Hobson calls being color brave, oh color brave, that's

13:19.480 --> 13:25.000
what it means, okay, okay, okay, so here's, here's the deal, here's the deal, no longer are we expected

13:25.000 --> 13:31.160
to treat people equally regardless of their skin color, we have to be color brave, we have to

13:31.160 --> 13:36.760
understand that I guess the darkies need to be treated differently because they're not white,

13:37.720 --> 13:42.520
is that what you're saying here, Starbucks CEO, so here is what we will do together today,

13:43.320 --> 13:49.400
we'll begin by welcoming each other and by sharing who we are and having curiosity about others,

13:50.520 --> 13:56.680
we will explore America's history of prejudice in public spaces and we will learn about bias,

13:56.680 --> 14:02.920
where it comes from, and that it's a normal part of each person, and we'll talk about some ways

14:02.920 --> 14:07.880
that we can work together to help others feel welcome, to feel included, to feel valued,

14:08.680 --> 14:12.040
even in those situations where customers may not treat us in the same way,

14:13.320 --> 14:20.760
and please keep this in mind, you are not alone, we know that for every, I'm just gonna stop here,

14:21.400 --> 14:27.160
I've been to some gender studies classes in the past, this seems remarkably like that,

14:27.160 --> 14:31.960
so let's move on to video three here, I do want to see what our rapper has to say about this,

14:32.920 --> 14:40.120
I am grateful to be with you Starbucks partners today because this work is close to my heart,

14:40.920 --> 14:48.440
helping people see each other fully, completely, respectfully, my role throughout this day is to

14:48.440 --> 14:53.880
get us started in good conversation, let's start first by appreciating each other,

14:54.840 --> 15:01.800
I know that for me welcoming people in my life starts first with sharing who I am and then

15:01.800 --> 15:07.640
listening closely to where someone else is coming from, who they are, what they are proud of,

15:08.280 --> 15:15.400
what makes them them, now usually when we do this kind of thing in our everyday lives in America,

15:15.400 --> 15:20.680
we try to find similarity between people, we try to find ways in which we are alike,

15:21.240 --> 15:28.360
and that's good, yet it turns out there's also great advantage in your work, in your life,

15:28.360 --> 15:33.320
in your relationships, to learn to love what makes you different from someone else,

15:33.320 --> 15:37.800
to seek out how someone is different, and that is what makes them interesting,

15:38.680 --> 15:44.440
it's a life skill to make someone else in your presence feel welcome, you do that by not only

15:44.440 --> 15:49.880
loving what makes them the same as you, but by appreciating what makes them different than you,

15:50.840 --> 15:55.240
now you're going to hear from Starbucks partners who will guide you through the day,

15:56.200 --> 16:00.840
to start building the life skill of appreciating people's differences,

16:00.840 --> 16:07.080
get your notebook out and turn to what makes me, me, and you, you, it should be at the front of

16:07.080 --> 16:13.000
your book, this guy really seems like he was told to do this or he was going to be fired,

16:13.000 --> 16:18.360
yeah let's just get back to this, let's get back to the the actual pamphlet here that we got,

16:18.360 --> 16:24.520
we have like 63 pages here Jesus, seeing what makes us unique and different, grab your notebook,

16:24.920 --> 16:28.520
pair it with somebody in your group, this really is grade school shit,

16:29.640 --> 16:34.840
open your notebook to page four to the activity what makes me, me, and you, you, when you're done

16:35.880 --> 16:44.360
return to the team guidebook to discuss with the group, holy shit man I'm legit having childhood

16:44.360 --> 16:49.320
flashbacks, discuss with your team which pair found the most differences, how did you find

16:49.320 --> 16:54.120
so many, what questions did you ask, how did you ask them, now that you see the other person you

16:54.120 --> 16:59.320
talk to more clearly, what new information do you appreciate about them, man what if someone

16:59.320 --> 17:06.680
is like I don't want to talk about my personal life in this exercise, I came here to do a job,

17:06.680 --> 17:11.000
I want to get paid and go home, are they going to be like no you must tell me about all your

17:11.000 --> 17:15.240
differences, do you really got to get into this shit, take a 15-minute break it's been fucking

17:15.240 --> 17:22.200
grueling guys, Starbucks who we are, who we aspire to be, oh god do you really want to watch all

17:22.200 --> 17:28.680
these videos, how many videos are there, let me just see this here, three, four, five, what it

17:28.680 --> 17:42.840
feels like to belong, seven, eight, now whole, holy shit, oh my, I can't believe actually having to

17:42.840 --> 17:51.560
have done this, Jesus, I'm sorry Starbucks employees, these audio clips seem to be like

17:51.560 --> 17:56.200
examples, okay hold on, confusion about a customer's gender, let's listen to this,

17:56.200 --> 18:00.360
seems to be an audio sample of what to do, so I was working in the store one weekend and we were

18:00.360 --> 18:06.120
a store that's on a transit line, the bus dropped off right in front of our store and then every

18:06.120 --> 18:10.680
time every bus let out everybody'd come in, get some coffee, want to use the bathroom because

18:10.680 --> 18:16.920
they're in the midst of a trip, we had one customer come in specifically who asked for

18:16.920 --> 18:22.680
the men's restroom key and that's where we had two separate keys, one was blue for the men's and the

18:22.680 --> 18:28.120
other one was pink for the women's, they asked for the men's key and we handed them the women's key

18:28.120 --> 18:33.160
because although the individual identified male they looked female to us working behind the

18:33.160 --> 18:39.960
counter, the customer then said no I really identify male and I've asked you for the men's key

18:41.240 --> 18:45.400
so we handed them the men's key and said hey we're really sorry that that happened,

18:45.400 --> 18:50.040
here's the key that you asked for, go ahead and you can go around the corner to the to the

18:50.040 --> 18:57.000
bathroom, our bathroom was in a shared building so when the customer went into the main building

18:57.000 --> 19:01.320
they were actually told by security that they weren't even allowed to access the men's room

19:01.320 --> 19:06.040
because the building said that they didn't believe that they were a male either, which

19:06.040 --> 19:10.600
point the customer came back in and became very irate, we told them we were really sorry

19:10.600 --> 19:18.680
that we'd done the best we could at that point in time. Absolutely harrowing, I mean it does sound

19:18.680 --> 19:23.800
like a terrible inconvenience that they might have to go to a restroom that they don't really

19:23.800 --> 19:31.960
identify with and take their shit there. Women with dirty cup asks for refill, how, okay.

19:31.960 --> 19:45.800
Okay so one morning a lady came in she was wearing a sweat and she had a paper cup our Starbucks cup

19:47.240 --> 19:54.280
and she said she wants to get a coffee, a cup of coffee refill and

19:55.160 --> 20:02.760
but the cup was really dirty and has like a lot of stains on it and so I said when did you,

20:02.760 --> 20:08.200
when did you get this coffee, when did you get the first cup and she said this morning

20:11.320 --> 20:19.240
but the fact that the coffee cup was really dirty I said to her that she cannot get a refill.

20:19.320 --> 20:26.680
Okay that actually sounds reasonable because it seems like maybe this person had like found a cup

20:26.680 --> 20:31.960
that was old or had a cup from several days ago that had kind of gone through the wear and tear

20:31.960 --> 20:39.160
and was no longer entitled to a refill. Why is this part of this package?

20:39.160 --> 20:46.120
Women in dirty sweatpants lingering near retail cups. There was a woman in dirty sweatpants

20:46.120 --> 20:53.880
lingering near retail cups. There was a busy morning at my store back in downtown

20:54.840 --> 21:01.720
where a lady came in and her sweatpants had stains in them and they also had holes

21:02.760 --> 21:09.160
so I quickly told my partners like hey I'm gonna switch over to warming so that I can keep my eye

21:09.160 --> 21:14.600
on her and I noticed her going back and forth back and forth from the retail cups it was during

21:14.600 --> 21:26.120
Christmas so we had all the red box cups and she I assumed she was going to steal and I approached

21:26.120 --> 21:32.600
her and I said would you like any help with anything and turns out that she wanted to buy one

21:32.600 --> 21:43.800
as a gift. Okay as somebody who has worked retail in the past you do get to know the the body

21:43.800 --> 21:50.680
language and the behaviors of people who are trying to shoplift. Recognizing those patterns

21:51.400 --> 21:57.400
is not a bad thing. Jesus I can't believe this where do these where do all these clips show up

21:57.400 --> 22:01.160
in this thing I gotta scroll back up and see this hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on

22:01.880 --> 22:08.680
okay okay fuck the team guidebook here we go page 50 making every customer feel like they

22:08.680 --> 22:15.800
belong at Starbucks listen to all the audios every human must be seen respected and uplifted

22:16.920 --> 22:23.160
whether or not they're customers oh shit you have to like seen respected it like fill out one of

22:23.160 --> 22:30.840
these for each for each scenario oh wow okay well here here's here's what we can do to make

22:30.840 --> 22:35.480
these vagrants in our store feel welcome let's get back back to where we were a little bit here

22:35.480 --> 22:39.240
I don't know if I want to go through all this guys like holy shit there's a lot of

22:39.240 --> 22:44.520
nonsense here however however I did realize that video six is colorblind to color brave

22:44.520 --> 22:51.480
so let's watch that one all right I want to get to it with the hard question how do you define

22:52.040 --> 23:01.640
bias what is it so bias is our brains look at this incredibly diverse panel automatic association

23:01.640 --> 23:08.120
and processing of negative stereotypes about certain groups of people so that sounds somewhat

23:08.120 --> 23:15.000
clinical if you could break it down even further so when we talk about bias we're actually talking

23:15.000 --> 23:20.680
about two kinds of bias there's explicit bias which is when we are very consciously do not

23:20.680 --> 23:27.960
particularly care for a group the implicit bias is when our brains have made associations about

23:27.960 --> 23:32.360
a particular group negative stereotypes about a particular group that have become embedded in our

23:32.360 --> 23:36.840
brains over time so how do you know it when you're doing it how do you know it when you see it hold

23:36.840 --> 23:42.600
on hold on hold on what matters here isn't necessarily the bias it's the behavior explicit

23:42.600 --> 23:49.880
bias can obviously be a problem because it actually leads to explicit behaviors um implicit

23:49.880 --> 23:56.360
bias almost never generates itself as behavior like if you if you feel a certain way about a

23:56.360 --> 24:03.080
particular race or or a particular gender or a particular type of person and it's implicit

24:03.080 --> 24:11.000
and you don't act on it and your behavior doesn't change then what what harm's been done are unless

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
of course you want to thoughtfully everybody you want to control what people think how about going

24:15.000 --> 24:20.200
at it that way you often don't know it when you're doing it because if it's an implicit bias that

24:20.200 --> 24:24.360
means you have it in the back of your brain you're not conscious of it and in fact it can be

24:24.360 --> 24:29.800
completely inconsistent with your actual beliefs so oftentimes the risk is you in fact don't know

24:29.800 --> 24:34.440
when you're making an automatic association do you think our company should be one of those

24:34.440 --> 24:40.440
institutions that helps people understand their biases do you think that's the job of a of a

24:40.440 --> 24:47.640
company like ours if we're going no we're going to have a business where we're interfacing with

24:47.640 --> 24:53.960
the public i think we're responsible to help a workforce navigate these nuances and relationships

24:53.960 --> 24:59.320
and human connection personally i've realized i have a big beard i have a line in my head

24:59.880 --> 25:05.720
that that smile of hers back there that was her saying you just kept your job son i can be

25:05.720 --> 25:12.680
capable i can be competent and i can lead people and i can you know be an individual an individual

25:14.360 --> 25:20.680
as long as you think the right way compassion empathy i think those are great places to start

25:20.680 --> 25:25.640
so a lot of people talk about being colorblind what is it about color blindness that creates

25:25.640 --> 25:31.800
a problem here we go our brains can't not see people's different racial categories that's the

25:31.800 --> 25:37.240
way we've grown up to evaluate people so we can't turn that off and this is something that fred

25:37.240 --> 25:41.960
talked about beautifully it seems to me from what i hear from my friends who are people of color

25:41.960 --> 25:47.480
they don't want me to not see them as their full selves and for many if it's something that we

25:47.480 --> 25:53.000
can't change you can't be colorblind it is impossible for humanity or individual humans

25:53.000 --> 25:59.560
to be colorblind then what's the point what's the point of any of this i mean if we are stuck as

25:59.560 --> 26:04.600
these miserable wretches who are always destined to be racist then what is the point of all this

26:04.600 --> 26:09.160
just just fucking give up people their full selves involves a sense of racial identity

26:09.160 --> 26:16.200
help me understand as practitioners how you explain to people what implicit bias is so that

26:16.280 --> 26:21.160
they can start to recognize it we usually start by having people understand how their

26:21.160 --> 26:26.200
unconscious brain works so we have an exercise that we could do that would give us all a chance

26:26.200 --> 26:31.400
to see what it means to have your unconscious brain overcome your conscious brain okay how does

26:31.400 --> 26:38.440
it work sure okay okay i'm going to give you what is called a stroup test so in order to talk about

26:38.440 --> 26:43.400
bias it's really important to understand how our brains operate unconsciously we're going to take

26:43.400 --> 26:49.960
the stroup test which was invented by dr stroup in 1935 it's a group activity so i want you all

26:49.960 --> 26:58.440
to state the color of the text let's try one together blue blue did you all say blue together

26:59.160 --> 27:06.840
great let the test begin oh jesus it's gonna be one of these eh it's gonna be a thing where like

27:06.840 --> 27:11.560
it it'll change yeah yeah see see what it's doing see what it's doing it's going faster and faster

27:12.200 --> 27:21.240
and it's having a word but a different color so for example this says red but it's actually black

27:21.240 --> 27:31.640
and you're reading you're not looking at color um what this has to do with fucking racism i have

27:31.640 --> 27:37.960
no clue at my store i have a transit uh gentleman um his name is steve he comes in every day but

27:37.960 --> 27:43.800
he's a customer um but his appearance um is that of somebody who lives on the street my initial

27:43.800 --> 27:49.320
response was i don't know this guy uh he's not really supporting the atmosphere that i want to

27:49.320 --> 27:57.160
have in here um but i had to check that and engage and just watch you know and and talk and and now

27:57.160 --> 28:04.360
we're good friends um does steve buy anything because that's really what matters it doesn't

28:04.360 --> 28:09.160
matter that you guys are friends it doesn't matter how he dresses what matters is that

28:09.160 --> 28:18.360
he comes in with money and buys coffee that's it and he comes in there all the time this is

28:18.360 --> 28:22.600
the type of moments that we're trying to create so tell me about the difference between personal

28:22.600 --> 28:29.160
bias which i think which is a lot of people feel the weight of and feel the shame of

28:30.120 --> 28:35.480
and structural bias if you think about kind of where someone lives where they go to school

28:35.480 --> 28:40.440
the transportation system that helps them get there all of those systems all those places of

28:40.440 --> 28:45.800
how we just navigate our daily life in today's very segregated society some people have been

28:45.800 --> 28:53.480
afforded access other people haven't wait today's very segregated society one america has not been

28:53.480 --> 29:00.120
segregated for some time now two with all this talk of not being colorblind and recognizing

29:00.120 --> 29:05.400
differences that's creating segregation that rapper from earlier talked all about focusing

29:05.400 --> 29:11.000
on differences and not how they're the same how is that not a segregating force in society you

29:11.000 --> 29:18.520
talk about this idea of racial anxiety what is that racial anxiety is our our bodies are in our

29:18.520 --> 29:23.160
brain stress response to cross-racial interaction and it shows up differently if i'm a person of

29:23.160 --> 29:28.360
color and i'm engaging in across racial interaction i'm worried that whatever's coming towards me my

29:28.360 --> 29:33.240
defense mechanism goes up right and if you're white it's showing up as a big fear that you

29:33.240 --> 29:40.520
may confirm yourself as racist you may say something or do something okay oh oh oh so so

29:40.520 --> 29:46.360
here here's racial anxiety if you're white you're afraid you're going to be outed as a racist if

29:46.360 --> 29:54.920
you're a non-white or a person of color you fear for your life you fear i i don't know like it

29:54.920 --> 29:58.600
couldn't it couldn't possibly be the other way around could it it couldn't it couldn't possibly

29:58.600 --> 30:07.240
be that a white person fears a black person or that a non-white person fears being outed as racist

30:07.240 --> 30:13.240
and really you're just talking about whites and non-whites like everything that's non-white is

30:13.240 --> 30:19.240
just one giant category how how do jewish people fit into this how do asians fit into this how do

30:19.240 --> 30:24.840
native people fit into this none of this really seems to make any sense but the racial anxiety

30:24.840 --> 30:31.400
actually helps us understand that that interpersonal work that we need to do is really one of the key

30:31.400 --> 30:37.880
things that's getting in the way why is bias bad for business if there are any groups who feel like

30:37.880 --> 30:42.200
they're not treated as well who feel like they're being othered as our colleague john powell would

30:42.200 --> 30:46.600
say and don't have that sense of belonging that starbucks talks about that's bad for business

30:47.160 --> 30:51.880
something else you said that's really important is how the partners feel obviously well see that's

30:51.880 --> 30:57.960
where capitalism steps in in a purely capitalistic system it would not matter your race or gender or

30:57.960 --> 31:03.880
anything else the only thing that matters is whether or not you have the money to buy something

31:03.880 --> 31:09.160
at starbucks so you can be a homeless man with money come in buy your coffee you're welcome there

31:09.160 --> 31:13.080
you can be a black person come in buy your coffee you're welcome there you can be

31:13.720 --> 31:20.200
any type of human if you have money you're welcome in the store those two black guys who were

31:20.200 --> 31:25.720
arrested they didn't buy anything which is why this isn't a race issue which is why this entire

31:25.720 --> 31:33.240
exercise is pointless starbucks actually has a very multi-racial multi-ethnic multi-religious

31:33.240 --> 31:38.360
staff and so in order for the people who are partners to be their best selves they need to

31:38.360 --> 31:47.800
feel supported so today when we close down our stores to get more training and hopefully come

31:47.800 --> 31:55.560
away with more learnings around bias explicit and implicit structural and personal can we structurally

31:55.560 --> 32:00.680
change the organization through something like this some are skeptical so i think we would say

32:00.680 --> 32:05.000
the structural work is something that has to be done for far longer than the four-hour day

32:05.000 --> 32:09.800
and that's policy that's the work the company has to do to support the partners in the individual

32:09.800 --> 32:15.880
work and the teamwork that they do within here's what sjws often mean when they say structure when

32:15.880 --> 32:21.240
they talk about structures they say this is something that needs to be constantly reinforced

32:21.240 --> 32:25.240
and that's why it's going to take longer than this four-hour program it's an ideology that needs to

32:25.240 --> 32:32.280
be hammered in every day because if it's not people are going to realize that it's bullshit

32:32.280 --> 32:35.640
their institutions because one of the things we don't want to see is for each person to have

32:35.640 --> 32:40.680
to bear this burden alone and also so the partners can themselves be treated respectfully by each

32:40.680 --> 32:45.080
other because the partners can be on the receiving end of all this as well fred anything that you

32:45.080 --> 32:52.200
think we could leave behind for our partners as they think about bias if they had one takeaway

32:52.200 --> 32:58.760
that could help them be better assuming everyone wants to be better at this with the third place

32:58.760 --> 33:03.800
in the human connections that we're trying to make when you feel like there's uh there's an

33:03.800 --> 33:09.160
there's something uncomfortable happening let's listen let's take that moment that pause um to

33:09.160 --> 33:15.480
listen and and sort of center ourselves the other piece is body language if we can feel comfortable

33:15.480 --> 33:20.760
enough to come from around our counter um to actually connect with that person who is

33:20.760 --> 33:24.840
disappointed or maybe we had a perceived bias about but we're going to listen we're going to

33:24.840 --> 33:28.920
be present our body language is not going to be this but we're going to be here we're going to

33:28.920 --> 33:34.680
be present for that conversation i think that begins to open up a world of opportunity when we

33:35.240 --> 33:41.240
when we talk about connection and we want to be in a space that's respectful with them and not

33:41.240 --> 33:46.920
come in with preconceived or structural or stereotypical notions about the individual

33:46.920 --> 33:53.960
thank you thanks very much wow that told me nothing jesus christ i'm not going through

33:53.960 --> 33:57.880
this pamphlet anymore there's a few things i want to check out though before we uh we finish up this

33:58.440 --> 34:04.440
this training exercise today here guys i want to watch video eight because this is the stanley

34:04.440 --> 34:08.520
nelson documentary and i do want to check out one more thing after this so let's watch this

34:08.520 --> 34:14.840
documentary first a stanley nelson story of access this independently created film by stanley nelson

34:14.840 --> 34:18.760
was underwritten by starbucks with the intent of educating our partners about the history of access

34:18.760 --> 34:22.840
to public spaces for african americans this film explores the impact of bias within public

34:22.840 --> 34:26.760
accommodations as well as the possibilities for a better future dear starbucks partners

34:27.480 --> 34:35.240
i'm stanley nelson a documentary filmmaker my films are about race america and the decades long

34:35.240 --> 34:43.320
struggle for all people to be treated as equals in public spaces our town squares our stores our

34:43.320 --> 34:52.360
fields our parks our pools our restaurants congratulations you have it now and have had it

34:52.360 --> 34:59.080
for some time i made this film to help us understand this important struggle in our country

34:59.640 --> 35:01.800
so we can go forward together

35:01.800 --> 35:15.640
when i go into stores sometimes i get followed which is really annoying and it just gives me

35:15.640 --> 35:19.320
like it just makes me uncomfortable and sometimes i get anxiety so i have to leave

35:20.440 --> 35:26.840
oh geez i'm i'm sorry that your anxiety your anxiety is what makes you leave i gotta be honest

35:26.840 --> 35:31.480
i'm a white guy and sometimes i i've gone into stores and i've been followed too

35:32.760 --> 35:39.640
and as a retail worker you know sometimes you you you notice somebody maybe maybe their body

35:39.640 --> 35:43.000
language has been off maybe they're doing something odd maybe you at the very least

35:43.000 --> 35:49.240
want to keep an eye on them to make sure that they're not going to steal and it's it's been

35:49.240 --> 35:54.440
in my experience less about race and more about how people present themselves you know i've i've

35:54.520 --> 36:01.800
seen white shoplifters and i've seen native shoplifters here in canada and and i've never

36:01.800 --> 36:08.120
shoplifted however i have had employees of stores follow me around and it's it's obvious that they're

36:08.120 --> 36:11.640
following me around because they're not really that sneaky but they're following me around

36:11.640 --> 36:17.080
like they think i'm going to shoplift and it's not a race thing especially being a teen of color

36:17.080 --> 36:23.320
they assume that you're doing something bad i feel like i'm disturbing people by just being there

36:24.040 --> 36:31.400
like people feel uncomfortable when i walk in i guess i've kind of become numb to it after so

36:31.400 --> 36:37.080
many years like this is just my life and it's just something that i've gotten used to unfortunately

36:37.080 --> 36:43.800
i think all of us make that choice at some point of am i going to take the burden of this

36:43.800 --> 36:48.840
interaction being comfortable or am i going to say you take the burden of this interaction

36:48.840 --> 36:54.920
being comfortable who goes into a social interaction thinking that way really who starts

36:54.920 --> 36:59.960
talking to somebody with the presumption that if you don't do something this is going to be

36:59.960 --> 37:06.200
uncomfortable like holy shit because what i really want is a sandwich do you know what i mean i don't

37:06.200 --> 37:11.960
want to fight i'm hungry right i don't want to get into this with you and i'm really not here to

37:11.960 --> 37:20.280
teach you this but other time then why are you here it's like okay wait a minute lesson time

37:22.760 --> 37:30.520
discrimination against african americans in public spaces has a long history in the 1960s

37:30.520 --> 37:38.760
black and white students trying to desegregate buses were firebombed it was terrible thankfully

37:38.760 --> 37:45.560
we've moved past it black patrons were routinely denied service in restaurants and hotels

37:51.000 --> 37:56.520
it was terrible thankfully we've moved past it as long as you have the money to actually

37:56.520 --> 37:59.800
pay for your stuff though not at starbucks apparently

38:01.400 --> 38:05.960
and civil rights workers were dragged from lunch counters spat upon and beaten

38:09.720 --> 38:16.040
we're willing to be beaten for democracy and you must use democracy the right to be respected in

38:16.040 --> 38:19.640
public spaces was at the heart of the civil rights movement

38:19.640 --> 38:32.200
they keep thinking we begging them for something we ain't begging for nothing we're telling them

38:36.200 --> 38:42.280
see the difference between these clips and what's going on at starbucks is that these people are

38:42.280 --> 38:47.480
actually confronting a legitimate problem in the society in which they lived the two guys at

38:47.480 --> 38:53.480
starbucks went in didn't order anything and were asked to leave and then they didn't and then the

38:53.480 --> 38:58.040
cops were called on them this is this is not illegal this is not a situation of them being

38:58.040 --> 39:04.280
arrested because they're black this is not a situation of misuse of police power frankly it

39:04.280 --> 39:11.320
almost denigrates the sacrifice of these people from the 1960s by comparing it to this ridiculous

39:11.320 --> 39:21.960
bullshit happening today the freedom movement of the 1950s and 60s insisted that the united states

39:21.960 --> 39:26.120
live up to its constitution and allow equal access for all

39:28.760 --> 39:36.120
finally the civil rights act of 1964 was passed outlawing discrimination in public spaces

39:37.000 --> 39:40.600
but changing the law doesn't always change

39:40.600 --> 39:46.040
reality and being allowed in doesn't always mean being welcomed

39:48.360 --> 39:54.920
to be welcomed as a customer means that not only do i allow you in but it means that i'm glad

39:54.920 --> 40:02.200
you're here i i want to serve you i want your business and i don't draw distinctions between

40:02.200 --> 40:08.520
you and other customers in terms yes yes yes i don't draw distinctions between you and other

40:08.520 --> 40:15.640
customers not you and other people you and other customers the implication is that you've paid for

40:15.640 --> 40:20.680
a good or a service in terms of your value but it's time we talk about what it means

40:21.240 --> 40:28.680
to not be welcomed as an american citizen it's not like i can mute my actual physical blackness

40:28.680 --> 40:47.160
right so i just i mean according to this chinese laundry commercial you you probably could

40:58.680 --> 41:07.160
do

41:18.440 --> 41:24.520
assume that people see a particular thing when they see the color of my skin so everything else

41:25.080 --> 41:36.600
has to be like perfect and clean and as blended in as possible is no you just you just have to

41:36.600 --> 41:42.120
have money you just have to go into a starbucks with money and be willing to buy something

41:42.120 --> 41:49.400
that's all no nobody cares about anything else really just an arsenal of different masks

41:49.960 --> 42:00.120
you know is one of those masks made of money um and it happens every time i

42:02.040 --> 42:07.800
every time i leave my house when i leave my house regardless of where i'm going the

42:08.600 --> 42:13.640
i'm just leaving my house just walking out the door i don't i'm not walking out the door thinking

42:14.440 --> 42:21.720
what kind of hurdle am i going to run into today what kind of way am i going to be judged i walk

42:21.720 --> 42:29.560
out a free man i just okay okay um on the one hand i see what this guy is saying because people

42:29.560 --> 42:35.560
and i assume this is also the case for people who have not internalized their own goddamn racism

42:35.560 --> 42:42.200
towards themselves so like you know kanye west for example people like that they probably just

42:42.200 --> 42:45.800
walk out the door thinking yeah you know whatever i gotta go out and do something i'm gonna go out

42:45.800 --> 42:53.000
and do it um at the same time everyone and i mean everyone regardless of race will go out the door

42:53.000 --> 42:57.320
and think how they're going to be judged that's why you comb your hair well if you if you had

42:57.320 --> 43:01.560
hair i assume you'd comb it that's why you don't wear dirty clothes that's why you shower before

43:01.560 --> 43:06.680
you go outside you get judged for a lot more than race and and honestly you get judged for some

43:06.680 --> 43:11.320
things way harsher than race man i mean jordan peterson said it best would you rather be ugly

43:11.320 --> 43:17.640
or be an immigrant just do my thing i have to make sure that i have given enough space between

43:17.640 --> 43:22.600
myself and another patron or another uh commuter on the train just ensure that i'm not making

43:22.600 --> 43:27.960
someone uncomfortable i have to make sure they're my hand man man i do that too when i'm on the bus

43:28.600 --> 43:33.800
unless the bus is packed i'm not going to just jam myself beside somebody it's not about your

43:33.800 --> 43:40.040
skin color it's about not being rude things are visible when i walk into certain places so they

43:40.040 --> 43:46.600
make sure i don't not stealing um i try to make sure i make eye contact with people who may or may

43:46.600 --> 43:52.760
not be security or managerial staff just ensure that you know i'm not here to hide anything uh

43:53.320 --> 43:58.280
i watch my tone to make sure that i don't come off as threatening just leaving the house some days you

43:58.280 --> 44:06.280
know it's it's it sounds it sounds so terrible that you have to be a decent human being in public

44:06.280 --> 44:12.440
you know because these are all things that i also do as a white person and that i assume

44:12.440 --> 44:19.480
most decent people do it's called not being a dick don't just keep you at home and just keep

44:19.480 --> 44:29.240
you away from everything for more than 50 years equal treatment has been the law yet as we know

44:29.240 --> 44:35.800
from cell phone videos the nightly news and maybe our own experience we still have a long way to go

44:35.800 --> 44:41.880
why are you following yeah yeah i mean it's it's really terrible there are individuals out there

44:41.880 --> 44:47.560
who are assholes and if you want to like catch them on video put it on youtube and say this guy's

44:47.560 --> 44:51.560
an asshole go ahead i'll probably laugh at it at some point when i come across it

44:52.280 --> 44:56.520
but that's pretty much the extent of it this is not some kind of systemic problem

44:56.600 --> 44:59.160
watch this

45:01.880 --> 45:09.960
you think i'm stealing your card is fake you're going to jail that's what i kept

45:26.920 --> 45:33.720
we just okay okay so some of these instances are going to be legitimate police brutality

45:33.720 --> 45:38.840
and obviously that's not a good thing i mean we don't even have to really go down that road do we

45:38.840 --> 45:43.480
but at the same time how many of these people do you think turned it into a race issue like the

45:43.480 --> 45:47.880
police had a legitimate reason to arrest one of these people or at the very least talk to them

45:47.880 --> 45:51.960
about something and they just said oh you're doing this because i'm black and then escalated it and

45:51.960 --> 45:56.360
then it turned into a shit show like do you think that that might have happened once or twice indeed

45:57.160 --> 46:00.680
that black people are navigating the public space differently than white people

46:01.800 --> 46:06.440
and how much of that is their own choice really how many didn't do nothing do you think are

46:06.440 --> 46:11.080
actually out there how many good boys just going to college that women are navigating the public

46:11.080 --> 46:16.280
space differently than men and not use the shortcut that has been wired into your brain

46:16.280 --> 46:21.960
because of the society that we live in that tells you when you see me you should be nervous

46:21.960 --> 46:29.640
or you should be worried it i'm not nervous or worried i'm just stunned brought me such despair

46:30.360 --> 46:39.000
to the day i recognized i had to explain this to my son that he was gonna that that this muddy

46:39.000 --> 46:44.200
river of racism he was still gonna have to walk through it we hadn't damned it we hadn't dried

46:44.200 --> 46:49.080
it up it was still there for him to go through and i've got to somehow try to tell him okay

46:50.040 --> 46:57.880
off you go maybe if you didn't keep focusing on your differences maybe maybe if the black

46:57.880 --> 47:03.560
community wasn't ridiculously belligerent when it came to police interaction maybe if black fathers

47:03.560 --> 47:09.320
actually stuck around their families then you wouldn't have this muddy river of racism but you

47:09.320 --> 47:14.760
know what at this point i think it's safe to say that at least a fair chunk of it is definitely the

47:14.760 --> 47:22.600
black community's own doing the society i want to see is i want to be able to walk out the house

47:22.600 --> 47:28.600
just as free feeling as that white guy who said he doesn't worry about a thing when he walks out

47:28.600 --> 47:34.040
the door i want well that's on you isn't it how you feel isn't that your responsibility if you

47:34.040 --> 47:39.240
were to say i want to walk out the door as free as a white guy well you have that now don't you

47:39.240 --> 47:43.640
but free feeling well that's on you it's not anybody else's responsibility to make you feel

47:43.640 --> 47:51.560
better want to have that same expectation today discrimination is against the law

47:52.680 --> 48:00.200
it's the people and the systems that support our communities that must follow suit yes absolutely

48:00.200 --> 48:07.480
changing the law is not enough we also must force people to change we must force a cultural change

48:07.480 --> 48:14.520
everything is racist everything is sexist and you must point it all out no one's going to do it for

48:14.520 --> 48:23.000
us what can you do to make our schools our parks our stores our restaurants as welcoming and as

48:23.000 --> 48:31.640
inclusive as they can be um treat oh dude she's a cutie um treat people equally that is really why

48:31.640 --> 48:37.640
capitalism is probably the best system for equality because it simply says if you have

48:37.640 --> 48:44.440
money you are welcome and race and gender and none of that nonsense actually matters

48:46.440 --> 48:51.640
what kind of country do we want to live in who do we want to be

48:51.640 --> 49:04.440
okay well i regret doing this let's uh let's turn this piece of shit off the last thing i want to go

49:04.440 --> 49:09.960
to is the my notebook now this is where employees have to actually fill this out a space for your

49:09.960 --> 49:13.960
private thoughts however you're expected to give it back to starbucks management so it's not really

49:13.960 --> 49:19.640
private is it what makes me me and you you this is the first exercise they had to do similarities

49:19.640 --> 49:23.880
bond us together yet being able to perceive what makes us unique and different from each other

49:23.880 --> 49:28.760
gives us the gift of seeing each other as full human beings pair up with somebody on your team

49:28.760 --> 49:33.080
keep time using your phone how classless of starbucks to assume everyone has a phone try

49:33.080 --> 49:37.480
to find as many ways as you can that you are different from each other okay so again focus

49:37.480 --> 49:44.360
on differences generate that segregation in your life where do you feel a sense of belonging feeling

49:44.360 --> 49:49.160
welcome feeling included feeling like yourself well really the only place where you have a right

49:49.160 --> 49:54.840
to feel a sense of belonging is in your own house frankly that's pretty much it the first step to

49:54.840 --> 50:00.440
becoming color brave read through the following pages take your time seeing how bias operates

50:00.440 --> 50:07.320
takes reflection and introspection our unconscious brain processes 11 million bits of information a

50:07.320 --> 50:15.160
second in that same time our conscious brain processes only 40 bits thus we process more

50:15.160 --> 50:20.360
unconsciously than consciously well i'm sure that anybody can work out this math

50:20.360 --> 50:26.520
without the third sentence there but uh this sounds like some ridiculous bullshit right here

50:26.520 --> 50:32.680
okay 11 million bits from information a second let me just let me just work this out 11 11 million

50:32.680 --> 50:45.800
bits in gigabytes okay it's 1.375 okay in in megabytes 1.3 megs okay so let's say that our

50:45.800 --> 50:53.000
unconscious brain processes 1.3 megs of information a second only 40 bits in our conscious brain i i

50:53.000 --> 50:58.360
don't think this is true forget about the the ridiculousness of measuring human brain capacity

50:58.360 --> 51:05.960
in in a computer term like like bits but only 40 bits okay that's five bytes what can you store

51:05.960 --> 51:14.200
in five bytes of memory if i can think of a word in my conscious brain that is say 15 letters long

51:14.200 --> 51:21.400
some long ass word i'm already storing more than five bytes right if i can think of a song is is

51:21.400 --> 51:26.760
one second of remembered song more than five bytes i think it might be look how stupid this

51:26.760 --> 51:31.080
is already okay let's keep going though jesus christ our brains do this because they must if

51:31.080 --> 51:35.400
we had to process everything consciously the day would be so exhausting we'd never get through it

51:35.400 --> 51:40.360
to help us function our brains take shortcuts when shortcuts are applied to the characteristics

51:40.360 --> 51:46.360
traits and behaviors of a certain group of people they are called stereotypes there's no way this is

51:46.360 --> 51:52.040
scientifically accurate there is no way this is actually how the psychology works stereotypes are

51:52.040 --> 51:56.200
shaped by the things we take in around us much of it comes through the media but also our experiences

51:56.200 --> 52:00.040
and the broader culture we live in so is this starbucks admitting that stereotypes actually

52:00.040 --> 52:06.360
have a basis of truth in them maybe the risk is that when we hold negative stereotypes unconscious

52:06.360 --> 52:11.640
bias can arise when we're under pressure are short on time or don't pay attention unconscious

52:11.640 --> 52:17.000
biases are triggered more easily we can hold biases about race and age and religion gender

52:17.000 --> 52:22.760
and sexuality and body type ability and mental health and class and many other attributes

52:22.760 --> 52:27.800
i just have to straight up agree here i mean my monk in dnd might be really really fat but

52:27.800 --> 52:32.440
you can't have a bias based on his body type he can flip bears over man that's why it's important

52:32.440 --> 52:36.600
that we learn about how our biases are framed what we can do to override them biases are not always

52:36.600 --> 52:40.120
easy to identify they make us feel exposed maybe even critical of ourselves but they're worth

52:40.120 --> 52:44.920
reflecting on this is basically where they say you might feel that hunch of rationality saying

52:44.920 --> 52:50.440
this doesn't really uh this doesn't really make sense but it's important that you ignore that

52:50.440 --> 52:55.720
for the greater good of social justice when we address our emotions as they relate to our biases

52:55.720 --> 53:01.880
we build the muscle that helps us override them let's try it now the first time you recall when

53:01.880 --> 53:05.480
you first experienced your racial identity it may have been when you were a child it may have been

53:05.480 --> 53:09.800
last week if a scenario doesn't apply to you feel free to leave it blank and move on to the next one

53:10.360 --> 53:16.040
when you notice your racial identity noticed how your race affected your beauty standards

53:16.040 --> 53:19.880
felt your accent impacted people's perception of your intelligence or competence

53:20.680 --> 53:25.480
altered your communication style to avoid playing into stereotypes what if i just said

53:25.480 --> 53:29.400
i don't feel comfortable talking about this i mean these had to be collected right am i going to get

53:29.400 --> 53:34.760
fired for that had a friend of a different race who regularly visited your home if your group

53:34.760 --> 53:38.840
doesn't contain a token black person i guess you're a racist imagine you're meeting two

53:38.840 --> 53:43.240
different people for the first time one of them is of your race the other one is of a different race

53:43.240 --> 53:49.800
without thinking too much don't think about it guys just select the level of difficulty that

53:49.800 --> 53:55.240
reflects how you might react in each instance i'm gonna assume that most people you know most

53:55.240 --> 54:01.720
casual western liberals are gonna put the same marker for people of your race and people of not

54:01.720 --> 54:06.440
not of your race oh there's a glossary in here let's let's check this shit out belonging an

54:06.440 --> 54:11.080
authentic feeling of empowerment and participation in a group experienced in a person feels safe

54:11.640 --> 54:17.640
valued and accepted discrimination the unequal treatment of members of various groups based on

54:17.640 --> 54:24.600
race gender social class sexual orientation physical ability religion and other categories

54:24.600 --> 54:29.800
now it doesn't really say whether or not that unequal treatment is good or bad whether it's

54:29.800 --> 54:34.040
deserved or not whether it's proper or not because there are certainly instances where

54:34.040 --> 54:38.840
discrimination is actually a good thing think about it this way the most discriminating act

54:38.840 --> 54:45.400
that any one person can do is be in a monogamous relationship right because you're saying that

54:45.400 --> 54:51.080
i'm only having sex with this person and you are discriminating against everybody else do

54:51.080 --> 54:57.240
we want our sexuality to be equalized now too i mean at some point you do have to choose one

54:57.240 --> 55:02.200
thing over another and if that's always going to be discrimination and that's always going to be

55:02.200 --> 55:08.360
bad then society basically breaks down exclusion the process or state of being set apart from other

55:08.360 --> 55:14.840
people or things well yes i mean i'm going to exclude you from my relationship with my girlfriend

55:15.400 --> 55:20.360
i'm going to exclude you from my store if you don't buy things and therefore are not a customer

55:20.360 --> 55:25.480
the terminology presented in this in this key terms page is simply presented like it's supposed

55:25.480 --> 55:31.560
to be negative when it's actually quite neutral institutional racism the ways in which institutional

55:31.560 --> 55:37.320
policies and practices create different outcomes for different racial groups creating unbalanced

55:37.320 --> 55:42.680
advantages for whites along with oppression and disadvantages for people from groups classified

55:42.680 --> 55:49.960
as non-white so would you say for example that when black fathers leave their kids in a single

55:49.960 --> 55:55.800
parent household at alarming rates that's institutional racism because that would be a

55:55.800 --> 56:01.240
practice of the black community you know an institutional almost practice of the black

56:01.240 --> 56:05.960
community that creates a different outcome for a different racial group with the benefit of a

56:05.960 --> 56:12.200
stable family that whites have being some form of privilege i guess you could say racial equity

56:12.760 --> 56:19.080
the aspirational condition that would be achieved if one's racial identity no longer predicted in a

56:19.080 --> 56:26.840
statistical sense how one fares so it's not it's not equality guys it's equity if it's equality

56:26.840 --> 56:32.040
well then everyone gets a fair shake and then these various things like say black fathers not

56:32.040 --> 56:36.840
sticking around to raise their kids well i mean that that's the choice of the black father and

56:36.840 --> 56:41.640
well i guess that means that the black kids start a little bit behind in life but it is still equal

56:41.640 --> 56:46.840
because they had the choice not to do that but racial equity means that society must fill in

56:46.840 --> 56:52.280
those gaps no matter the cost well once you've filled out that private workbook and handed it

56:52.280 --> 56:57.480
off to starbucks management for further inspection interrogation of any possible wrong think you can

56:57.480 --> 57:06.440
then watch the final video called sticking with it to be color brave is to be brave period whether

57:06.440 --> 57:12.920
it was easy or hard for you today above all thank you for choosing to be here we began some very

57:12.920 --> 57:22.680
important conversations today but let's be clear this is just the beginning it's a start and now

57:22.680 --> 57:28.040
more than ever the world needs the third place a place where everyone feels they can belong

57:28.840 --> 57:34.440
and this starts by first understanding that we each have biases and then actively working to

57:34.440 --> 57:39.800
address them but there's more that we can do to create the third place consistent with our mission

57:39.800 --> 57:46.360
and values we can seek and eradicate bias and racism in our systems we can work to change our

57:46.360 --> 57:53.000
policies and processes and we can each commit to work on ourselves the more you are aware of your

57:53.000 --> 57:59.880
bias the more you can work to disrupt it and help all people who walk into a starbucks to feel seen

58:00.520 --> 58:08.440
to feel respected to feel uplifted my biggest ask is that every single one of us commit to this

58:08.440 --> 58:14.920
journey we won't get it right every single time but if we stay at this we will get it right more

58:14.920 --> 58:21.080
and more so thank you for everything you brought to today i am so proud to call you my partner

58:21.640 --> 58:25.560
and i'm especially proud that we are on this journey together

58:25.560 --> 58:33.480
you know what after that i feel culturally enriched i feel like i should allow a bunch

58:33.480 --> 58:38.120
of belligerent people into my local starbucks who have no interest in buying anything and

58:38.120 --> 58:42.920
no reason to be there except to take a steaming shit on the tables because they've got the right

58:42.920 --> 58:48.200
skin color i want to live my life safe and secure in the fact that if i ever get a job i'm going to

58:48.200 --> 58:54.120
be led into a closed room strapped into a chair for four hours and spoon-fed videos on how racist

58:54.120 --> 58:59.720
and sexist i am by the company's ceo this is the bright future that i want and starbucks's ceo is

58:59.720 --> 59:04.520
paving the way for this to be a universal oh do you think i'm joking about that you know how

59:04.520 --> 59:08.440
schultz resigned as ceo from starbucks right around the time this whole shit storm started

59:08.440 --> 59:13.560
well written in an article by usa today is this passage schultz's ideology has dipped into the

59:13.560 --> 59:18.600
political sphere too his outspokenness on issues such as gay rights and refugees has fueled

59:18.600 --> 59:23.160
speculation that he's looking to run for office perhaps president starbucks didn't comment about

59:23.160 --> 59:28.280
plans that he's seeking elected office in his letter he didn't rule it out saying i'll be

59:28.280 --> 59:33.000
thinking about a range of options for myself from philanthropy to public service but i'm a long way

59:33.000 --> 59:37.240
from knowing what the future holds yeah schultz doesn't know what the future holds my ass remember

59:37.240 --> 59:42.520
when hillary said she wasn't going to run for 2016 way back when i do i can already see the campaign

59:42.520 --> 59:48.600
slogan schultz 2020 diversity ipads in every home i'd end this by saying the usual vote with your

59:48.600 --> 59:52.680
wallet in regards to starbucks but i don't think that's going to work this time the people at the

59:52.760 --> 59:57.000
top of starbucks would rather open their doors wide like a homeless shelter instead of actually

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.480
exercising their rights all because somebody called them racist they've deliberately chosen

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:15.240
to lose money for the sake of social justice all we can do now is wait for the end

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.280
so
