0	11400	On April 12th, 2018, two African-American men were arrested for loitering in a Starbucks.
11400	15520	This is a topic I covered in detail on my April 22nd video titled Starbucks and the
15520	19240	Belligerents of Black American Subculture, and I recommend you go back and watch that
19240	21480	one before checking this one out, if you haven't already.
21480	25140	And I'd just like to point out, most of the time I choose the title of these videos
25140	29060	after I've completed them, I really didn't think that one was going to be so spicy until
29060	30100	after I'd uploaded it.
30100	34880	In any case, due to this incident, on April 15th, Starbucks released a statement revealing
34880	40160	that all locations would be closed on May 29th for racial bias education training for
40160	44260	approximately 175,000 of the company's American employees.
44260	47400	It would later be revealed that this would not be limited to just the United States and
47400	50420	would include both managers and part-time staff.
50420	54360	Starbucks CEO at the time, Howard Schultz, described the four-hour training course as
54360	59680	just the beginning, offered the two rightfully-arrested men free tuition because they refused to either
59680	63340	make a purchase or leave the establishment when asked, and stated that, "...we're
63340	67100	living in a time in America where there is a fracturing of humanity."
67100	71980	Schultz would almost immediately step down as CEO of Starbucks after this incident, handing
71980	75860	the reins over to Kevin Johnson, who would continue in his predecessor's cuck steps
75860	79180	by personally flying to Philly to apologize to the two arrested men.
79180	83580	Johnson would reiterate Starbucks' commitment to Schultz's diversity training plan stating
83580	88080	that, "...closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey
88080	91680	that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local
91680	92680	communities."
92680	97040	On May 29th, Starbucks locations across the US as well as Canada and other countries did
97040	101120	actually close for this racial bias training, and a viewer of the channel actually has a
101120	104900	partner who is a manager at a Starbucks here in Canada and has provided me with pictures
104900	105900	of the training package.
105900	109380	We'll go over this package in detail a little later, but for now let's see what this
109380	111600	viewer has to say about it from their own mouth.
111620	112620	Hey Dev!
112620	115460	Today is sensitivity training for every Starbucks employee in North America.
115460	119120	I think I've told you before, but my partner works at a Starbucks in Toronto.
119120	122420	Part of her job is doing schedules as well as managing employees.
122420	126980	Expect a lot of stories to come out of this, because people are not happy about this.
126980	130740	Everyone has to take the training on the retail end of Starbucks, and I mean everyone.
130740	133660	Even people who work three jobs are being made to take the training.
133660	137900	My partner's already had tons of people say things like, hey I can't make it but
137900	140580	I'm mixed race so I probably don't need it.
140580	144480	Management is forcing them to reschedule and take the sensitivity training later.
144480	147680	It doesn't matter if you're the blackest, gayest chick in the world, you have to take
147680	148680	it.
148680	151260	I'm surprised to see Starbucks not fold and let black people out of it.
151260	154840	My partner didn't have any recordings, but a lot of this stuff was done through video
154840	157640	files on iPads distributed by Starbucks.
157640	160680	100% chance that those files leak pretty damn fast.
160680	164640	Every store in North America had this lesson, and a lot of employees are pissed.
164640	166120	Even management hates this.
166120	169460	So the way this was presented was everyone was broken off into large groups and asked
169460	172000	to discuss every question as they answered it in the book.
172000	175720	They were presented with a video beforehand that I wish I had on hand to show you, but
175720	177560	my partner couldn't get her hands on it.
177560	182200	Some ridiculous propaganda video showing American civil rights footage and talking about making
182200	184360	America better even though this is Canada.
184360	188560	The booklet also clearly has stuff aimed at black people in it, just without saying black
188560	189560	people.
189560	193580	They were told that Canada would get an adapted version that focuses more on native problems,
193580	194680	but that wasn't true.
194680	198480	Okay, so she just gave me more details and we got a bit of a bombshell.
198480	202740	Starbucks not only wanted the pamphlets back after completion, but they also wanted people's
202740	203740	names on them.
203740	206260	It seems like they wanted to keep records of what people answered.
206260	208960	In fact, Starbucks is still asking for them back.
208960	212940	Some stores were better about getting them back right away, but her store is so big that
212940	216060	the management didn't really give a shit about hounding people down for theirs.
216060	220500	How predictably Orwellian of you, Starbucks, to want everybody to sign their names on their
220500	223580	answer sheets, so you know exactly who is guilty of wrongthink.
223580	227780	And it also sounds like there's a lot of misconduct, misinformation, and mismanagement
227840	229280	of the whole ridiculous program.
229280	231960	But there is one thing that really did stand out to me.
231960	236000	That Starbucks is really, really intent on having all the materials returned to them.
236000	237840	It seems like they may not want it to get out.
237840	238840	And I'm not surprised.
238840	243500	An article in the Daily Mail claims that employees were shown video after video of black people
243500	248660	being abused during racial sensitivity training, while USA Today reported that hip-hop artist
248660	252960	Common was in on the video sections, surely to maximize the cringe factor.
252960	256980	And the centerpiece of the entire presentation was an edited version of the documentary Story
257000	258920	of Access by Stanley Nelson.
258920	262960	Now, all of these videos and iPads described by the person who provided me with this info?
262960	267520	It turns out they're actually all privated videos on Starbucks' YouTube channel.
267520	270160	And the course content for this diversity training program?
270160	277140	It's all online, on the website StarbucksChannel.com, on a buried page inconspicuously titled The
277140	278440	Third Place.
278440	281800	This is just a hunch, I don't have any real evidence for this, but I have a feeling that
281800	285840	Starbucks knew it had to make this information public at some point, but decided to just
285840	290540	quietly publish it on a side site with privated materials in the hopes that nobody would actually
290540	291540	notice.
291540	296900	Thankfully, the SJW ghost town outlet known as Boing Boing stupidly embedded one of the
296900	300780	privated videos into an article, which is how I found all this hidden stuff in the first
300780	301780	place.
301780	305040	A video whose description linked back to The Third Place.
305040	307500	Why do I think they wanted to keep it quiet, though?
307500	312620	Because I've gone over the pamphlet, the videos, and the exam, and oh boy, it is all fucking
312620	313620	ridiculous.
313620	314940	But don't take my word for it.
315040	319200	Let's you and I take this diversity training course for ourselves, shall we?
319200	322760	So here's The Third Place, our commitment renewed.
322760	324920	It says it's a three minute read.
324920	327880	I have a feeling that it's probably not a three minute read.
327880	334720	On May 29th, we closed 8,000 Starbucks stores in the United States for four hours, so 175,000
334720	338600	Starbucks partners could come together for a conversation and learning session on racial
338600	339600	bias.
339600	344620	This was a foundational step in renewing Starbucks as a place where all people feel welcome.
344620	348740	Starbucks partners shared life experiences, heard from others, listened to experts on
348740	353920	bias and racial anxiety, reflecting on the realities of bias in our society and talking
353920	358200	about how all of us can work together to create public spaces where everyone feels like they
358200	359200	belong.
359200	361880	When they're talking about racial anxiety, I wonder if they actually brought up white
361880	363140	anxiety?
363140	366800	Our mission, because we want to uplift others, we exist.
366800	367800	No, what?
367800	373640	To inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a
374260	379540	Our values, because we want to deliver on our mission, we show up by creating a culture
379540	383140	of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome, acting with courage, challenging
383140	387940	the status quo and finding new ways to grow our company and each other, being present,
387940	391940	connecting with transparency, dignity, and respect, delivering our very best in all we
391940	394860	do, holding ourselves accountable for results.
394860	399580	So far, this just seems like a regular training bullshit program that you have to go through
399580	403220	any time you're a new employee, but it does get a bit juicier later.
404120	408360	Our mission and values, ground rules, why we're here today, practice, seeing difference
408360	412760	is positive, who we are, who we aspire to be, practice reflecting on what belonging
412760	422200	feels like, understanding bias, practice becoming color brave, color brave, okay, structural
422200	429060	bias, practice envisioning belonging, making every customer feel they belong, practice,
429060	435840	see, respect, uplift, commitments, practice building new habits, okay, well, here's the
435840	440240	team guidebook, this guidebook was designed for groups of three to five Starbucks partners
440240	443880	to work through the relaying session at their own pace, okay, so basically what ended up
443880	448080	happening is they got groups of people together, they gave them an iPad and a team guidebook
448080	452080	and they had to basically follow a four hour training program and let's take a look at
452080	453080	this guidebook.
453080	458440	The first couple pages just seem to be the preamble redone, so there's 68 pages to this
458500	465620	thing, Jesus, okay, let's scroll through this here, there's our mission, the agenda, okay,
465620	469460	working together today, get into groups of three to five people, team up with people
469460	474940	you don't work closely with every day, team guidebook, one per team, iPad, please share
474940	481460	and be patient, come on now kids, you have to share and my notebook is 100% private except
481460	485380	when you hand in the my notebook to Starbucks management but we will get to the my notebook
485380	492000	section later, how to set up your iPad, find an available iPad, place it on the white rectangle
492000	501200	above, turn it on, so like they want you to actually insert the iPad into the book, okay,
501200	505680	also you have to lift the iPad to turn the page and it tells you right here, lift the
505680	513440	iPad, turn the page, so okay, let's keep going, ground rules, listen respectfully, speak your
513440	519960	truth and honour other people's truth, I'm not sure if they know the meaning of the word
519960	526080	truth, if your conversations get off track, pause and restart, yeah, don't have your own
526080	530880	thoughts here guys, just follow along, tips for getting back on track, say what you want
530880	534820	to pause, share what you're feeling, talk about it, in your working group for today
534820	539840	acknowledge it, we hear you, we hear you, we can't create a culture of warmth and belonging
539840	543400	if we don't first acknowledge that some of us deal with negative stereotypes every day,
543400	547160	we hear you, we can't connect with dignity and respect if we don't respect the different
547160	551760	starting points we all had in life, write it down in your notebook and revisit it later,
551760	557000	okay, this really feels like a grade 3 or a grade 4 social studies class man, video
557000	565080	1, Starbucks EVP Rosanne Williams, I'm showing your respect today, instructions, put an iPad
565080	569440	above, select video 1 on the iPad, so they want you to actually place the iPad in the
569440	575760	book and then play the video, I'm actually, I do have the videos down here, let's scroll
575760	581480	down a bit and here's video 1, let's watch it okay, just a YouTube embed, hello partners,
581480	585780	I wanted to share a few thoughts before you begin today, first of all, thank you in advance
585780	590240	for investing your time with one another, this is a needed conversation and one the
590240	595040	Starbucks family is more than capable of having, we are about creating a culture of warmth
595040	600760	and belonging where everyone is welcome, with that in mind, please remember a few things,
600760	606160	first listen respectfully, second speak with your truth and honour the truth of others,
606160	610760	third, if you need to take a moment, feel free to do so, conversations about race can
610760	616340	induce a feeling the experts call racial anxiety and when we're anxious, we can't always think
616340	620760	clearly, if this feeling starts to derail the conversation, there are a few things that
620760	626160	you can do as a group to get back on track, first let the group know you want to pause,
626160	630640	share what you're feeling in the most respectful way possible and then as a group, have a short
630640	636240	conversation about what was shared, remember to be present and listen with respect, this
636240	641320	is about you and your Starbucks family sharing this experience together, if you find you
641320	646100	need more support, please know that additional resources are available and more information
646100	661820	can be found at the bottom of this page in this guidebook, wow, ok, I don't know, racial
661820	668180	anxiety, ok, let's keep going here, why we are here today, this is just a second video
668180	672620	isn't it, yeah it is, Starbucks president and CEO Kevin Johnson, why are we here today,
672620	679660	video 2, video 3, artist, author and activist comment, oh here's the rapper, on making others
679660	688300	feel welcome, ok, ok, ok, so hold on, videos 2 and 3 have to be watched now, let's enjoy
688300	695140	this a little bit, ok, so let us begin, we are here to make Starbucks a place where everyone,
695140	701780	everyone feels welcome, full stop, even if you don't pay guys, you're still welcome,
701780	706180	there is the immediate reason we are gathering, and that is the disheartening situation that
706180	713020	unfolded in Philadelphia, where two young men were arrested in a Starbucks store, but
713020	718020	the issue of racial bias and discrimination isn't just about us as a company, it is about
718020	724980	us as a country, prejudice and public accommodation is deeply rooted in America, and core to our
724980	731560	mission has always been being that third place where everyone feels welcome, but the reality
731560	738040	is being that third place in 2018 is far more challenging, current year, homelessness, substance
738040	744920	abuse in our bathrooms, mental illness, these are all issues that a good portion, substance abuse in
744920	750200	your bathrooms, do you think that's going to get better or worse if you start allowing people in
750200	755320	who haven't bought anything, and you can just let them in, what do you think man, what do you think,
755320	761400	if you face each and every day, yet my hope in gathering us is that Starbucks can become a place
761400	768840	of welcoming, of warmth, and of inclusion for all, now given the state of race relations in this
768840	776720	country, it's easy to wonder if inclusion for all is even possible, here's my belief, growing up this
776720	783480	term called colorblind, described a learning behavior of pretending not to notice race, that
783480	791240	doesn't even make sense, so today we're starting a new journey, talking about race directly, what my
791240	799480	friend and Starbucks board member Melody Hobson calls being color brave, oh color brave, that's
799480	805000	what it means, okay, okay, okay, so here's, here's the deal, here's the deal, no longer are we expected
805000	811160	to treat people equally regardless of their skin color, we have to be color brave, we have to
811160	816760	understand that I guess the darkies need to be treated differently because they're not white,
817720	822520	is that what you're saying here, Starbucks CEO, so here is what we will do together today,
823320	829400	we'll begin by welcoming each other and by sharing who we are and having curiosity about others,
830520	836680	we will explore America's history of prejudice in public spaces and we will learn about bias,
836680	842920	where it comes from, and that it's a normal part of each person, and we'll talk about some ways
842920	847880	that we can work together to help others feel welcome, to feel included, to feel valued,
848680	852040	even in those situations where customers may not treat us in the same way,
853320	860760	and please keep this in mind, you are not alone, we know that for every, I'm just gonna stop here,
861400	867160	I've been to some gender studies classes in the past, this seems remarkably like that,
867160	871960	so let's move on to video three here, I do want to see what our rapper has to say about this,
872920	880120	I am grateful to be with you Starbucks partners today because this work is close to my heart,
880920	888440	helping people see each other fully, completely, respectfully, my role throughout this day is to
888440	893880	get us started in good conversation, let's start first by appreciating each other,
894840	901800	I know that for me welcoming people in my life starts first with sharing who I am and then
901800	907640	listening closely to where someone else is coming from, who they are, what they are proud of,
908280	915400	what makes them them, now usually when we do this kind of thing in our everyday lives in America,
915400	920680	we try to find similarity between people, we try to find ways in which we are alike,
921240	928360	and that's good, yet it turns out there's also great advantage in your work, in your life,
928360	933320	in your relationships, to learn to love what makes you different from someone else,
933320	937800	to seek out how someone is different, and that is what makes them interesting,
938680	944440	it's a life skill to make someone else in your presence feel welcome, you do that by not only
944440	949880	loving what makes them the same as you, but by appreciating what makes them different than you,
950840	955240	now you're going to hear from Starbucks partners who will guide you through the day,
956200	960840	to start building the life skill of appreciating people's differences,
960840	967080	get your notebook out and turn to what makes me, me, and you, you, it should be at the front of
967080	973000	your book, this guy really seems like he was told to do this or he was going to be fired,
973000	978360	yeah let's just get back to this, let's get back to the the actual pamphlet here that we got,
978360	984520	we have like 63 pages here Jesus, seeing what makes us unique and different, grab your notebook,
984920	988520	pair it with somebody in your group, this really is grade school shit,
989640	994840	open your notebook to page four to the activity what makes me, me, and you, you, when you're done
995880	1004360	return to the team guidebook to discuss with the group, holy shit man I'm legit having childhood
1004360	1009320	flashbacks, discuss with your team which pair found the most differences, how did you find
1009320	1014120	so many, what questions did you ask, how did you ask them, now that you see the other person you
1014120	1019320	talk to more clearly, what new information do you appreciate about them, man what if someone
1019320	1026680	is like I don't want to talk about my personal life in this exercise, I came here to do a job,
1026680	1031000	I want to get paid and go home, are they going to be like no you must tell me about all your
1031000	1035240	differences, do you really got to get into this shit, take a 15-minute break it's been fucking
1035240	1042200	grueling guys, Starbucks who we are, who we aspire to be, oh god do you really want to watch all
1042200	1048680	these videos, how many videos are there, let me just see this here, three, four, five, what it
1048680	1062840	feels like to belong, seven, eight, now whole, holy shit, oh my, I can't believe actually having to
1062840	1071560	have done this, Jesus, I'm sorry Starbucks employees, these audio clips seem to be like
1071560	1076200	examples, okay hold on, confusion about a customer's gender, let's listen to this,
1076200	1080360	seems to be an audio sample of what to do, so I was working in the store one weekend and we were
1080360	1086120	a store that's on a transit line, the bus dropped off right in front of our store and then every
1086120	1090680	time every bus let out everybody'd come in, get some coffee, want to use the bathroom because
1090680	1096920	they're in the midst of a trip, we had one customer come in specifically who asked for
1096920	1102680	the men's restroom key and that's where we had two separate keys, one was blue for the men's and the
1102680	1108120	other one was pink for the women's, they asked for the men's key and we handed them the women's key
1108120	1113160	because although the individual identified male they looked female to us working behind the
1113160	1119960	counter, the customer then said no I really identify male and I've asked you for the men's key
1121240	1125400	so we handed them the men's key and said hey we're really sorry that that happened,
1125400	1130040	here's the key that you asked for, go ahead and you can go around the corner to the to the
1130040	1137000	bathroom, our bathroom was in a shared building so when the customer went into the main building
1137000	1141320	they were actually told by security that they weren't even allowed to access the men's room
1141320	1146040	because the building said that they didn't believe that they were a male either, which
1146040	1150600	point the customer came back in and became very irate, we told them we were really sorry
1150600	1158680	that we'd done the best we could at that point in time. Absolutely harrowing, I mean it does sound
1158680	1163800	like a terrible inconvenience that they might have to go to a restroom that they don't really
1163800	1171960	identify with and take their shit there. Women with dirty cup asks for refill, how, okay.
1171960	1185800	Okay so one morning a lady came in she was wearing a sweat and she had a paper cup our Starbucks cup
1187240	1194280	and she said she wants to get a coffee, a cup of coffee refill and
1195160	1202760	but the cup was really dirty and has like a lot of stains on it and so I said when did you,
1202760	1208200	when did you get this coffee, when did you get the first cup and she said this morning
1211320	1219240	but the fact that the coffee cup was really dirty I said to her that she cannot get a refill.
1219320	1226680	Okay that actually sounds reasonable because it seems like maybe this person had like found a cup
1226680	1231960	that was old or had a cup from several days ago that had kind of gone through the wear and tear
1231960	1239160	and was no longer entitled to a refill. Why is this part of this package?
1239160	1246120	Women in dirty sweatpants lingering near retail cups. There was a woman in dirty sweatpants
1246120	1253880	lingering near retail cups. There was a busy morning at my store back in downtown
1254840	1261720	where a lady came in and her sweatpants had stains in them and they also had holes
1262760	1269160	so I quickly told my partners like hey I'm gonna switch over to warming so that I can keep my eye
1269160	1274600	on her and I noticed her going back and forth back and forth from the retail cups it was during
1274600	1286120	Christmas so we had all the red box cups and she I assumed she was going to steal and I approached
1286120	1292600	her and I said would you like any help with anything and turns out that she wanted to buy one
1292600	1303800	as a gift. Okay as somebody who has worked retail in the past you do get to know the the body
1303800	1310680	language and the behaviors of people who are trying to shoplift. Recognizing those patterns
1311400	1317400	is not a bad thing. Jesus I can't believe this where do these where do all these clips show up
1317400	1321160	in this thing I gotta scroll back up and see this hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
1321880	1328680	okay okay fuck the team guidebook here we go page 50 making every customer feel like they
1328680	1335800	belong at Starbucks listen to all the audios every human must be seen respected and uplifted
1336920	1343160	whether or not they're customers oh shit you have to like seen respected it like fill out one of
1343160	1350840	these for each for each scenario oh wow okay well here here's here's what we can do to make
1350840	1355480	these vagrants in our store feel welcome let's get back back to where we were a little bit here
1355480	1359240	I don't know if I want to go through all this guys like holy shit there's a lot of
1359240	1364520	nonsense here however however I did realize that video six is colorblind to color brave
1364520	1371480	so let's watch that one all right I want to get to it with the hard question how do you define
1372040	1381640	bias what is it so bias is our brains look at this incredibly diverse panel automatic association
1381640	1388120	and processing of negative stereotypes about certain groups of people so that sounds somewhat
1388120	1395000	clinical if you could break it down even further so when we talk about bias we're actually talking
1395000	1400680	about two kinds of bias there's explicit bias which is when we are very consciously do not
1400680	1407960	particularly care for a group the implicit bias is when our brains have made associations about
1407960	1412360	a particular group negative stereotypes about a particular group that have become embedded in our
1412360	1416840	brains over time so how do you know it when you're doing it how do you know it when you see it hold
1416840	1422600	on hold on hold on what matters here isn't necessarily the bias it's the behavior explicit
1422600	1429880	bias can obviously be a problem because it actually leads to explicit behaviors um implicit
1429880	1436360	bias almost never generates itself as behavior like if you if you feel a certain way about a
1436360	1443080	particular race or or a particular gender or a particular type of person and it's implicit
1443080	1451000	and you don't act on it and your behavior doesn't change then what what harm's been done are unless
1451000	1455000	of course you want to thoughtfully everybody you want to control what people think how about going
1455000	1460200	at it that way you often don't know it when you're doing it because if it's an implicit bias that
1460200	1464360	means you have it in the back of your brain you're not conscious of it and in fact it can be
1464360	1469800	completely inconsistent with your actual beliefs so oftentimes the risk is you in fact don't know
1469800	1474440	when you're making an automatic association do you think our company should be one of those
1474440	1480440	institutions that helps people understand their biases do you think that's the job of a of a
1480440	1487640	company like ours if we're going no we're going to have a business where we're interfacing with
1487640	1493960	the public i think we're responsible to help a workforce navigate these nuances and relationships
1493960	1499320	and human connection personally i've realized i have a big beard i have a line in my head
1499880	1505720	that that smile of hers back there that was her saying you just kept your job son i can be
1505720	1512680	capable i can be competent and i can lead people and i can you know be an individual an individual
1514360	1520680	as long as you think the right way compassion empathy i think those are great places to start
1520680	1525640	so a lot of people talk about being colorblind what is it about color blindness that creates
1525640	1531800	a problem here we go our brains can't not see people's different racial categories that's the
1531800	1537240	way we've grown up to evaluate people so we can't turn that off and this is something that fred
1537240	1541960	talked about beautifully it seems to me from what i hear from my friends who are people of color
1541960	1547480	they don't want me to not see them as their full selves and for many if it's something that we
1547480	1553000	can't change you can't be colorblind it is impossible for humanity or individual humans
1553000	1559560	to be colorblind then what's the point what's the point of any of this i mean if we are stuck as
1559560	1564600	these miserable wretches who are always destined to be racist then what is the point of all this
1564600	1569160	just just fucking give up people their full selves involves a sense of racial identity
1569160	1576200	help me understand as practitioners how you explain to people what implicit bias is so that
1576280	1581160	they can start to recognize it we usually start by having people understand how their
1581160	1586200	unconscious brain works so we have an exercise that we could do that would give us all a chance
1586200	1591400	to see what it means to have your unconscious brain overcome your conscious brain okay how does
1591400	1598440	it work sure okay okay i'm going to give you what is called a stroup test so in order to talk about
1598440	1603400	bias it's really important to understand how our brains operate unconsciously we're going to take
1603400	1609960	the stroup test which was invented by dr stroup in 1935 it's a group activity so i want you all
1609960	1618440	to state the color of the text let's try one together blue blue did you all say blue together
1619160	1626840	great let the test begin oh jesus it's gonna be one of these eh it's gonna be a thing where like
1626840	1631560	it it'll change yeah yeah see see what it's doing see what it's doing it's going faster and faster
1632200	1641240	and it's having a word but a different color so for example this says red but it's actually black
1641240	1651640	and you're reading you're not looking at color um what this has to do with fucking racism i have
1651640	1657960	no clue at my store i have a transit uh gentleman um his name is steve he comes in every day but
1657960	1663800	he's a customer um but his appearance um is that of somebody who lives on the street my initial
1663800	1669320	response was i don't know this guy uh he's not really supporting the atmosphere that i want to
1669320	1677160	have in here um but i had to check that and engage and just watch you know and and talk and and now
1677160	1684360	we're good friends um does steve buy anything because that's really what matters it doesn't
1684360	1689160	matter that you guys are friends it doesn't matter how he dresses what matters is that
1689160	1698360	he comes in with money and buys coffee that's it and he comes in there all the time this is
1698360	1702600	the type of moments that we're trying to create so tell me about the difference between personal
1702600	1709160	bias which i think which is a lot of people feel the weight of and feel the shame of
1710120	1715480	and structural bias if you think about kind of where someone lives where they go to school
1715480	1720440	the transportation system that helps them get there all of those systems all those places of
1720440	1725800	how we just navigate our daily life in today's very segregated society some people have been
1725800	1733480	afforded access other people haven't wait today's very segregated society one america has not been
1733480	1740120	segregated for some time now two with all this talk of not being colorblind and recognizing
1740120	1745400	differences that's creating segregation that rapper from earlier talked all about focusing
1745400	1751000	on differences and not how they're the same how is that not a segregating force in society you
1751000	1758520	talk about this idea of racial anxiety what is that racial anxiety is our our bodies are in our
1758520	1763160	brain stress response to cross-racial interaction and it shows up differently if i'm a person of
1763160	1768360	color and i'm engaging in across racial interaction i'm worried that whatever's coming towards me my
1768360	1773240	defense mechanism goes up right and if you're white it's showing up as a big fear that you
1773240	1780520	may confirm yourself as racist you may say something or do something okay oh oh oh so so
1780520	1786360	here here's racial anxiety if you're white you're afraid you're going to be outed as a racist if
1786360	1794920	you're a non-white or a person of color you fear for your life you fear i i don't know like it
1794920	1798600	couldn't it couldn't possibly be the other way around could it it couldn't it couldn't possibly
1798600	1807240	be that a white person fears a black person or that a non-white person fears being outed as racist
1807240	1813240	and really you're just talking about whites and non-whites like everything that's non-white is
1813240	1819240	just one giant category how how do jewish people fit into this how do asians fit into this how do
1819240	1824840	native people fit into this none of this really seems to make any sense but the racial anxiety
1824840	1831400	actually helps us understand that that interpersonal work that we need to do is really one of the key
1831400	1837880	things that's getting in the way why is bias bad for business if there are any groups who feel like
1837880	1842200	they're not treated as well who feel like they're being othered as our colleague john powell would
1842200	1846600	say and don't have that sense of belonging that starbucks talks about that's bad for business
1847160	1851880	something else you said that's really important is how the partners feel obviously well see that's
1851880	1857960	where capitalism steps in in a purely capitalistic system it would not matter your race or gender or
1857960	1863880	anything else the only thing that matters is whether or not you have the money to buy something
1863880	1869160	at starbucks so you can be a homeless man with money come in buy your coffee you're welcome there
1869160	1873080	you can be a black person come in buy your coffee you're welcome there you can be
1873720	1880200	any type of human if you have money you're welcome in the store those two black guys who were
1880200	1885720	arrested they didn't buy anything which is why this isn't a race issue which is why this entire
1885720	1893240	exercise is pointless starbucks actually has a very multi-racial multi-ethnic multi-religious
1893240	1898360	staff and so in order for the people who are partners to be their best selves they need to
1898360	1907800	feel supported so today when we close down our stores to get more training and hopefully come
1907800	1915560	away with more learnings around bias explicit and implicit structural and personal can we structurally
1915560	1920680	change the organization through something like this some are skeptical so i think we would say
1920680	1925000	the structural work is something that has to be done for far longer than the four-hour day
1925000	1929800	and that's policy that's the work the company has to do to support the partners in the individual
1929800	1935880	work and the teamwork that they do within here's what sjws often mean when they say structure when
1935880	1941240	they talk about structures they say this is something that needs to be constantly reinforced
1941240	1945240	and that's why it's going to take longer than this four-hour program it's an ideology that needs to
1945240	1952280	be hammered in every day because if it's not people are going to realize that it's bullshit
1952280	1955640	their institutions because one of the things we don't want to see is for each person to have
1955640	1960680	to bear this burden alone and also so the partners can themselves be treated respectfully by each
1960680	1965080	other because the partners can be on the receiving end of all this as well fred anything that you
1965080	1972200	think we could leave behind for our partners as they think about bias if they had one takeaway
1972200	1978760	that could help them be better assuming everyone wants to be better at this with the third place
1978760	1983800	in the human connections that we're trying to make when you feel like there's uh there's an
1983800	1989160	there's something uncomfortable happening let's listen let's take that moment that pause um to
1989160	1995480	listen and and sort of center ourselves the other piece is body language if we can feel comfortable
1995480	2000760	enough to come from around our counter um to actually connect with that person who is
2000760	2004840	disappointed or maybe we had a perceived bias about but we're going to listen we're going to
2004840	2008920	be present our body language is not going to be this but we're going to be here we're going to
2008920	2014680	be present for that conversation i think that begins to open up a world of opportunity when we
2015240	2021240	when we talk about connection and we want to be in a space that's respectful with them and not
2021240	2026920	come in with preconceived or structural or stereotypical notions about the individual
2026920	2033960	thank you thanks very much wow that told me nothing jesus christ i'm not going through
2033960	2037880	this pamphlet anymore there's a few things i want to check out though before we uh we finish up this
2038440	2044440	this training exercise today here guys i want to watch video eight because this is the stanley
2044440	2048520	nelson documentary and i do want to check out one more thing after this so let's watch this
2048520	2054840	documentary first a stanley nelson story of access this independently created film by stanley nelson
2054840	2058760	was underwritten by starbucks with the intent of educating our partners about the history of access
2058760	2062840	to public spaces for african americans this film explores the impact of bias within public
2062840	2066760	accommodations as well as the possibilities for a better future dear starbucks partners
2067480	2075240	i'm stanley nelson a documentary filmmaker my films are about race america and the decades long
2075240	2083320	struggle for all people to be treated as equals in public spaces our town squares our stores our
2083320	2092360	fields our parks our pools our restaurants congratulations you have it now and have had it
2092360	2099080	for some time i made this film to help us understand this important struggle in our country
2099640	2101800	so we can go forward together
2101800	2115640	when i go into stores sometimes i get followed which is really annoying and it just gives me
2115640	2119320	like it just makes me uncomfortable and sometimes i get anxiety so i have to leave
2120440	2126840	oh geez i'm i'm sorry that your anxiety your anxiety is what makes you leave i gotta be honest
2126840	2131480	i'm a white guy and sometimes i i've gone into stores and i've been followed too
2132760	2139640	and as a retail worker you know sometimes you you you notice somebody maybe maybe their body
2139640	2143000	language has been off maybe they're doing something odd maybe you at the very least
2143000	2149240	want to keep an eye on them to make sure that they're not going to steal and it's it's been
2149240	2154440	in my experience less about race and more about how people present themselves you know i've i've
2154520	2161800	seen white shoplifters and i've seen native shoplifters here in canada and and i've never
2161800	2168120	shoplifted however i have had employees of stores follow me around and it's it's obvious that they're
2168120	2171640	following me around because they're not really that sneaky but they're following me around
2171640	2177080	like they think i'm going to shoplift and it's not a race thing especially being a teen of color
2177080	2183320	they assume that you're doing something bad i feel like i'm disturbing people by just being there
2184040	2191400	like people feel uncomfortable when i walk in i guess i've kind of become numb to it after so
2191400	2197080	many years like this is just my life and it's just something that i've gotten used to unfortunately
2197080	2203800	i think all of us make that choice at some point of am i going to take the burden of this
2203800	2208840	interaction being comfortable or am i going to say you take the burden of this interaction
2208840	2214920	being comfortable who goes into a social interaction thinking that way really who starts
2214920	2219960	talking to somebody with the presumption that if you don't do something this is going to be
2219960	2226200	uncomfortable like holy shit because what i really want is a sandwich do you know what i mean i don't
2226200	2231960	want to fight i'm hungry right i don't want to get into this with you and i'm really not here to
2231960	2240280	teach you this but other time then why are you here it's like okay wait a minute lesson time
2242760	2250520	discrimination against african americans in public spaces has a long history in the 1960s
2250520	2258760	black and white students trying to desegregate buses were firebombed it was terrible thankfully
2258760	2265560	we've moved past it black patrons were routinely denied service in restaurants and hotels
2271000	2276520	it was terrible thankfully we've moved past it as long as you have the money to actually
2276520	2279800	pay for your stuff though not at starbucks apparently
2281400	2285960	and civil rights workers were dragged from lunch counters spat upon and beaten
2289720	2296040	we're willing to be beaten for democracy and you must use democracy the right to be respected in
2296040	2299640	public spaces was at the heart of the civil rights movement
2299640	2312200	they keep thinking we begging them for something we ain't begging for nothing we're telling them
2316200	2322280	see the difference between these clips and what's going on at starbucks is that these people are
2322280	2327480	actually confronting a legitimate problem in the society in which they lived the two guys at
2327480	2333480	starbucks went in didn't order anything and were asked to leave and then they didn't and then the
2333480	2338040	cops were called on them this is this is not illegal this is not a situation of them being
2338040	2344280	arrested because they're black this is not a situation of misuse of police power frankly it
2344280	2351320	almost denigrates the sacrifice of these people from the 1960s by comparing it to this ridiculous
2351320	2361960	bullshit happening today the freedom movement of the 1950s and 60s insisted that the united states
2361960	2366120	live up to its constitution and allow equal access for all
2368760	2376120	finally the civil rights act of 1964 was passed outlawing discrimination in public spaces
2377000	2380600	but changing the law doesn't always change
2380600	2386040	reality and being allowed in doesn't always mean being welcomed
2388360	2394920	to be welcomed as a customer means that not only do i allow you in but it means that i'm glad
2394920	2402200	you're here i i want to serve you i want your business and i don't draw distinctions between
2402200	2408520	you and other customers in terms yes yes yes i don't draw distinctions between you and other
2408520	2415640	customers not you and other people you and other customers the implication is that you've paid for
2415640	2420680	a good or a service in terms of your value but it's time we talk about what it means
2421240	2428680	to not be welcomed as an american citizen it's not like i can mute my actual physical blackness
2428680	2447160	right so i just i mean according to this chinese laundry commercial you you probably could
2458680	2467160	do
2478440	2484520	assume that people see a particular thing when they see the color of my skin so everything else
2485080	2496600	has to be like perfect and clean and as blended in as possible is no you just you just have to
2496600	2502120	have money you just have to go into a starbucks with money and be willing to buy something
2502120	2509400	that's all no nobody cares about anything else really just an arsenal of different masks
2509960	2520120	you know is one of those masks made of money um and it happens every time i
2522040	2527800	every time i leave my house when i leave my house regardless of where i'm going the
2528600	2533640	i'm just leaving my house just walking out the door i don't i'm not walking out the door thinking
2534440	2541720	what kind of hurdle am i going to run into today what kind of way am i going to be judged i walk
2541720	2549560	out a free man i just okay okay um on the one hand i see what this guy is saying because people
2549560	2555560	and i assume this is also the case for people who have not internalized their own goddamn racism
2555560	2562200	towards themselves so like you know kanye west for example people like that they probably just
2562200	2565800	walk out the door thinking yeah you know whatever i gotta go out and do something i'm gonna go out
2565800	2573000	and do it um at the same time everyone and i mean everyone regardless of race will go out the door
2573000	2577320	and think how they're going to be judged that's why you comb your hair well if you if you had
2577320	2581560	hair i assume you'd comb it that's why you don't wear dirty clothes that's why you shower before
2581560	2586680	you go outside you get judged for a lot more than race and and honestly you get judged for some
2586680	2591320	things way harsher than race man i mean jordan peterson said it best would you rather be ugly
2591320	2597640	or be an immigrant just do my thing i have to make sure that i have given enough space between
2597640	2602600	myself and another patron or another uh commuter on the train just ensure that i'm not making
2602600	2607960	someone uncomfortable i have to make sure they're my hand man man i do that too when i'm on the bus
2608600	2613800	unless the bus is packed i'm not going to just jam myself beside somebody it's not about your
2613800	2620040	skin color it's about not being rude things are visible when i walk into certain places so they
2620040	2626600	make sure i don't not stealing um i try to make sure i make eye contact with people who may or may
2626600	2632760	not be security or managerial staff just ensure that you know i'm not here to hide anything uh
2633320	2638280	i watch my tone to make sure that i don't come off as threatening just leaving the house some days you
2638280	2646280	know it's it's it sounds it sounds so terrible that you have to be a decent human being in public
2646280	2652440	you know because these are all things that i also do as a white person and that i assume
2652440	2659480	most decent people do it's called not being a dick don't just keep you at home and just keep
2659480	2669240	you away from everything for more than 50 years equal treatment has been the law yet as we know
2669240	2675800	from cell phone videos the nightly news and maybe our own experience we still have a long way to go
2675800	2681880	why are you following yeah yeah i mean it's it's really terrible there are individuals out there
2681880	2687560	who are assholes and if you want to like catch them on video put it on youtube and say this guy's
2687560	2691560	an asshole go ahead i'll probably laugh at it at some point when i come across it
2692280	2696520	but that's pretty much the extent of it this is not some kind of systemic problem
2696600	2699160	watch this
2701880	2709960	you think i'm stealing your card is fake you're going to jail that's what i kept
2726920	2733720	we just okay okay so some of these instances are going to be legitimate police brutality
2733720	2738840	and obviously that's not a good thing i mean we don't even have to really go down that road do we
2738840	2743480	but at the same time how many of these people do you think turned it into a race issue like the
2743480	2747880	police had a legitimate reason to arrest one of these people or at the very least talk to them
2747880	2751960	about something and they just said oh you're doing this because i'm black and then escalated it and
2751960	2756360	then it turned into a shit show like do you think that that might have happened once or twice indeed
2757160	2760680	that black people are navigating the public space differently than white people
2761800	2766440	and how much of that is their own choice really how many didn't do nothing do you think are
2766440	2771080	actually out there how many good boys just going to college that women are navigating the public
2771080	2776280	space differently than men and not use the shortcut that has been wired into your brain
2776280	2781960	because of the society that we live in that tells you when you see me you should be nervous
2781960	2789640	or you should be worried it i'm not nervous or worried i'm just stunned brought me such despair
2790360	2799000	to the day i recognized i had to explain this to my son that he was gonna that that this muddy
2799000	2804200	river of racism he was still gonna have to walk through it we hadn't damned it we hadn't dried
2804200	2809080	it up it was still there for him to go through and i've got to somehow try to tell him okay
2810040	2817880	off you go maybe if you didn't keep focusing on your differences maybe maybe if the black
2817880	2823560	community wasn't ridiculously belligerent when it came to police interaction maybe if black fathers
2823560	2829320	actually stuck around their families then you wouldn't have this muddy river of racism but you
2829320	2834760	know what at this point i think it's safe to say that at least a fair chunk of it is definitely the
2834760	2842600	black community's own doing the society i want to see is i want to be able to walk out the house
2842600	2848600	just as free feeling as that white guy who said he doesn't worry about a thing when he walks out
2848600	2854040	the door i want well that's on you isn't it how you feel isn't that your responsibility if you
2854040	2859240	were to say i want to walk out the door as free as a white guy well you have that now don't you
2859240	2863640	but free feeling well that's on you it's not anybody else's responsibility to make you feel
2863640	2871560	better want to have that same expectation today discrimination is against the law
2872680	2880200	it's the people and the systems that support our communities that must follow suit yes absolutely
2880200	2887480	changing the law is not enough we also must force people to change we must force a cultural change
2887480	2894520	everything is racist everything is sexist and you must point it all out no one's going to do it for
2894520	2903000	us what can you do to make our schools our parks our stores our restaurants as welcoming and as
2903000	2911640	inclusive as they can be um treat oh dude she's a cutie um treat people equally that is really why
2911640	2917640	capitalism is probably the best system for equality because it simply says if you have
2917640	2924440	money you are welcome and race and gender and none of that nonsense actually matters
2926440	2931640	what kind of country do we want to live in who do we want to be
2931640	2944440	okay well i regret doing this let's uh let's turn this piece of shit off the last thing i want to go
2944440	2949960	to is the my notebook now this is where employees have to actually fill this out a space for your
2949960	2953960	private thoughts however you're expected to give it back to starbucks management so it's not really
2953960	2959640	private is it what makes me me and you you this is the first exercise they had to do similarities
2959640	2963880	bond us together yet being able to perceive what makes us unique and different from each other
2963880	2968760	gives us the gift of seeing each other as full human beings pair up with somebody on your team
2968760	2973080	keep time using your phone how classless of starbucks to assume everyone has a phone try
2973080	2977480	to find as many ways as you can that you are different from each other okay so again focus
2977480	2984360	on differences generate that segregation in your life where do you feel a sense of belonging feeling
2984360	2989160	welcome feeling included feeling like yourself well really the only place where you have a right
2989160	2994840	to feel a sense of belonging is in your own house frankly that's pretty much it the first step to
2994840	3000440	becoming color brave read through the following pages take your time seeing how bias operates
3000440	3007320	takes reflection and introspection our unconscious brain processes 11 million bits of information a
3007320	3015160	second in that same time our conscious brain processes only 40 bits thus we process more
3015160	3020360	unconsciously than consciously well i'm sure that anybody can work out this math
3020360	3026520	without the third sentence there but uh this sounds like some ridiculous bullshit right here
3026520	3032680	okay 11 million bits from information a second let me just let me just work this out 11 11 million
3032680	3045800	bits in gigabytes okay it's 1.375 okay in in megabytes 1.3 megs okay so let's say that our
3045800	3053000	unconscious brain processes 1.3 megs of information a second only 40 bits in our conscious brain i i
3053000	3058360	don't think this is true forget about the the ridiculousness of measuring human brain capacity
3058360	3065960	in in a computer term like like bits but only 40 bits okay that's five bytes what can you store
3065960	3074200	in five bytes of memory if i can think of a word in my conscious brain that is say 15 letters long
3074200	3081400	some long ass word i'm already storing more than five bytes right if i can think of a song is is
3081400	3086760	one second of remembered song more than five bytes i think it might be look how stupid this
3086760	3091080	is already okay let's keep going though jesus christ our brains do this because they must if
3091080	3095400	we had to process everything consciously the day would be so exhausting we'd never get through it
3095400	3100360	to help us function our brains take shortcuts when shortcuts are applied to the characteristics
3100360	3106360	traits and behaviors of a certain group of people they are called stereotypes there's no way this is
3106360	3112040	scientifically accurate there is no way this is actually how the psychology works stereotypes are
3112040	3116200	shaped by the things we take in around us much of it comes through the media but also our experiences
3116200	3120040	and the broader culture we live in so is this starbucks admitting that stereotypes actually
3120040	3126360	have a basis of truth in them maybe the risk is that when we hold negative stereotypes unconscious
3126360	3131640	bias can arise when we're under pressure are short on time or don't pay attention unconscious
3131640	3137000	biases are triggered more easily we can hold biases about race and age and religion gender
3137000	3142760	and sexuality and body type ability and mental health and class and many other attributes
3142760	3147800	i just have to straight up agree here i mean my monk in dnd might be really really fat but
3147800	3152440	you can't have a bias based on his body type he can flip bears over man that's why it's important
3152440	3156600	that we learn about how our biases are framed what we can do to override them biases are not always
3156600	3160120	easy to identify they make us feel exposed maybe even critical of ourselves but they're worth
3160120	3164920	reflecting on this is basically where they say you might feel that hunch of rationality saying
3164920	3170440	this doesn't really uh this doesn't really make sense but it's important that you ignore that
3170440	3175720	for the greater good of social justice when we address our emotions as they relate to our biases
3175720	3181880	we build the muscle that helps us override them let's try it now the first time you recall when
3181880	3185480	you first experienced your racial identity it may have been when you were a child it may have been
3185480	3189800	last week if a scenario doesn't apply to you feel free to leave it blank and move on to the next one
3190360	3196040	when you notice your racial identity noticed how your race affected your beauty standards
3196040	3199880	felt your accent impacted people's perception of your intelligence or competence
3200680	3205480	altered your communication style to avoid playing into stereotypes what if i just said
3205480	3209400	i don't feel comfortable talking about this i mean these had to be collected right am i going to get
3209400	3214760	fired for that had a friend of a different race who regularly visited your home if your group
3214760	3218840	doesn't contain a token black person i guess you're a racist imagine you're meeting two
3218840	3223240	different people for the first time one of them is of your race the other one is of a different race
3223240	3229800	without thinking too much don't think about it guys just select the level of difficulty that
3229800	3235240	reflects how you might react in each instance i'm gonna assume that most people you know most
3235240	3241720	casual western liberals are gonna put the same marker for people of your race and people of not
3241720	3246440	not of your race oh there's a glossary in here let's let's check this shit out belonging an
3246440	3251080	authentic feeling of empowerment and participation in a group experienced in a person feels safe
3251640	3257640	valued and accepted discrimination the unequal treatment of members of various groups based on
3257640	3264600	race gender social class sexual orientation physical ability religion and other categories
3264600	3269800	now it doesn't really say whether or not that unequal treatment is good or bad whether it's
3269800	3274040	deserved or not whether it's proper or not because there are certainly instances where
3274040	3278840	discrimination is actually a good thing think about it this way the most discriminating act
3278840	3285400	that any one person can do is be in a monogamous relationship right because you're saying that
3285400	3291080	i'm only having sex with this person and you are discriminating against everybody else do
3291080	3297240	we want our sexuality to be equalized now too i mean at some point you do have to choose one
3297240	3302200	thing over another and if that's always going to be discrimination and that's always going to be
3302200	3308360	bad then society basically breaks down exclusion the process or state of being set apart from other
3308360	3314840	people or things well yes i mean i'm going to exclude you from my relationship with my girlfriend
3315400	3320360	i'm going to exclude you from my store if you don't buy things and therefore are not a customer
3320360	3325480	the terminology presented in this in this key terms page is simply presented like it's supposed
3325480	3331560	to be negative when it's actually quite neutral institutional racism the ways in which institutional
3331560	3337320	policies and practices create different outcomes for different racial groups creating unbalanced
3337320	3342680	advantages for whites along with oppression and disadvantages for people from groups classified
3342680	3349960	as non-white so would you say for example that when black fathers leave their kids in a single
3349960	3355800	parent household at alarming rates that's institutional racism because that would be a
3355800	3361240	practice of the black community you know an institutional almost practice of the black
3361240	3365960	community that creates a different outcome for a different racial group with the benefit of a
3365960	3372200	stable family that whites have being some form of privilege i guess you could say racial equity
3372760	3379080	the aspirational condition that would be achieved if one's racial identity no longer predicted in a
3379080	3386840	statistical sense how one fares so it's not it's not equality guys it's equity if it's equality
3386840	3392040	well then everyone gets a fair shake and then these various things like say black fathers not
3392040	3396840	sticking around to raise their kids well i mean that that's the choice of the black father and
3396840	3401640	well i guess that means that the black kids start a little bit behind in life but it is still equal
3401640	3406840	because they had the choice not to do that but racial equity means that society must fill in
3406840	3412280	those gaps no matter the cost well once you've filled out that private workbook and handed it
3412280	3417480	off to starbucks management for further inspection interrogation of any possible wrong think you can
3417480	3426440	then watch the final video called sticking with it to be color brave is to be brave period whether
3426440	3432920	it was easy or hard for you today above all thank you for choosing to be here we began some very
3432920	3442680	important conversations today but let's be clear this is just the beginning it's a start and now
3442680	3448040	more than ever the world needs the third place a place where everyone feels they can belong
3448840	3454440	and this starts by first understanding that we each have biases and then actively working to
3454440	3459800	address them but there's more that we can do to create the third place consistent with our mission
3459800	3466360	and values we can seek and eradicate bias and racism in our systems we can work to change our
3466360	3473000	policies and processes and we can each commit to work on ourselves the more you are aware of your
3473000	3479880	bias the more you can work to disrupt it and help all people who walk into a starbucks to feel seen
3480520	3488440	to feel respected to feel uplifted my biggest ask is that every single one of us commit to this
3488440	3494920	journey we won't get it right every single time but if we stay at this we will get it right more
3494920	3501080	and more so thank you for everything you brought to today i am so proud to call you my partner
3501640	3505560	and i'm especially proud that we are on this journey together
3505560	3513480	you know what after that i feel culturally enriched i feel like i should allow a bunch
3513480	3518120	of belligerent people into my local starbucks who have no interest in buying anything and
3518120	3522920	no reason to be there except to take a steaming shit on the tables because they've got the right
3522920	3528200	skin color i want to live my life safe and secure in the fact that if i ever get a job i'm going to
3528200	3534120	be led into a closed room strapped into a chair for four hours and spoon-fed videos on how racist
3534120	3539720	and sexist i am by the company's ceo this is the bright future that i want and starbucks's ceo is
3539720	3544520	paving the way for this to be a universal oh do you think i'm joking about that you know how
3544520	3548440	schultz resigned as ceo from starbucks right around the time this whole shit storm started
3548440	3553560	well written in an article by usa today is this passage schultz's ideology has dipped into the
3553560	3558600	political sphere too his outspokenness on issues such as gay rights and refugees has fueled
3558600	3563160	speculation that he's looking to run for office perhaps president starbucks didn't comment about
3563160	3568280	plans that he's seeking elected office in his letter he didn't rule it out saying i'll be
3568280	3573000	thinking about a range of options for myself from philanthropy to public service but i'm a long way
3573000	3577240	from knowing what the future holds yeah schultz doesn't know what the future holds my ass remember
3577240	3582520	when hillary said she wasn't going to run for 2016 way back when i do i can already see the campaign
3582520	3588600	slogan schultz 2020 diversity ipads in every home i'd end this by saying the usual vote with your
3588600	3592680	wallet in regards to starbucks but i don't think that's going to work this time the people at the
3592760	3597000	top of starbucks would rather open their doors wide like a homeless shelter instead of actually
3597000	3601480	exercising their rights all because somebody called them racist they've deliberately chosen
3601480	3615240	to lose money for the sake of social justice all we can do now is wait for the end
3622680	3626280	so
