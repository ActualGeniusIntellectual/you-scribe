00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
On April 12th, 2018, two African-American men were arrested for loitering in a Starbucks.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,520
This is a topic I covered in detail on my April 22nd video titled Starbucks and the

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,240
Belligerents of Black American Subculture, and I recommend you go back and watch that

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,480
one before checking this one out, if you haven't already.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,140
And I'd just like to point out, most of the time I choose the title of these videos

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,060
after I've completed them, I really didn't think that one was going to be so spicy until

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,100
after I'd uploaded it.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,880
In any case, due to this incident, on April 15th, Starbucks released a statement revealing

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,160
that all locations would be closed on May 29th for racial bias education training for

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,260
approximately 175,000 of the company's American employees.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,400
It would later be revealed that this would not be limited to just the United States and

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
would include both managers and part-time staff.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,360
Starbucks CEO at the time, Howard Schultz, described the four-hour training course as

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,680
just the beginning, offered the two rightfully-arrested men free tuition because they refused to either

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,340
make a purchase or leave the establishment when asked, and stated that, "...we're

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,100
living in a time in America where there is a fracturing of humanity."

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,980
Schultz would almost immediately step down as CEO of Starbucks after this incident, handing

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,860
the reins over to Kevin Johnson, who would continue in his predecessor's cuck steps

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,180
by personally flying to Philly to apologize to the two arrested men.

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,580
Johnson would reiterate Starbucks' commitment to Schultz's diversity training plan stating

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,080
that, "...closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
communities."

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,040
On May 29th, Starbucks locations across the US as well as Canada and other countries did

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,120
actually close for this racial bias training, and a viewer of the channel actually has a

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,900
partner who is a manager at a Starbucks here in Canada and has provided me with pictures

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,900
of the training package.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,380
We'll go over this package in detail a little later, but for now let's see what this

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,600
viewer has to say about it from their own mouth.

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
Hey Dev!

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,460
Today is sensitivity training for every Starbucks employee in North America.

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,120
I think I've told you before, but my partner works at a Starbucks in Toronto.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,420
Part of her job is doing schedules as well as managing employees.

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,980
Expect a lot of stories to come out of this, because people are not happy about this.

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,740
Everyone has to take the training on the retail end of Starbucks, and I mean everyone.

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,660
Even people who work three jobs are being made to take the training.

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,900
My partner's already had tons of people say things like, hey I can't make it but

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm mixed race so I probably don't need it.

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,480
Management is forcing them to reschedule and take the sensitivity training later.

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,680
It doesn't matter if you're the blackest, gayest chick in the world, you have to take

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
it.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,260
I'm surprised to see Starbucks not fold and let black people out of it.

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,840
My partner didn't have any recordings, but a lot of this stuff was done through video

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,640
files on iPads distributed by Starbucks.

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,680
100% chance that those files leak pretty damn fast.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,640
Every store in North America had this lesson, and a lot of employees are pissed.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,120
Even management hates this.

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,460
So the way this was presented was everyone was broken off into large groups and asked

49
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,000
to discuss every question as they answered it in the book.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,720
They were presented with a video beforehand that I wish I had on hand to show you, but

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,560
my partner couldn't get her hands on it.

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,200
Some ridiculous propaganda video showing American civil rights footage and talking about making

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,360
America better even though this is Canada.

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,560
The booklet also clearly has stuff aimed at black people in it, just without saying black

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
people.

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,580
They were told that Canada would get an adapted version that focuses more on native problems,

57
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,680
but that wasn't true.

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,480
Okay, so she just gave me more details and we got a bit of a bombshell.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,740
Starbucks not only wanted the pamphlets back after completion, but they also wanted people's

60
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
names on them.

61
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,260
It seems like they wanted to keep records of what people answered.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,960
In fact, Starbucks is still asking for them back.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,940
Some stores were better about getting them back right away, but her store is so big that

64
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,060
the management didn't really give a shit about hounding people down for theirs.

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,500
How predictably Orwellian of you, Starbucks, to want everybody to sign their names on their

66
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,580
answer sheets, so you know exactly who is guilty of wrongthink.

67
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,780
And it also sounds like there's a lot of misconduct, misinformation, and mismanagement

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,280
of the whole ridiculous program.

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,960
But there is one thing that really did stand out to me.

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,000
That Starbucks is really, really intent on having all the materials returned to them.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
It seems like they may not want it to get out.

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
And I'm not surprised.

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,500
An article in the Daily Mail claims that employees were shown video after video of black people

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,660
being abused during racial sensitivity training, while USA Today reported that hip-hop artist

75
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,960
Common was in on the video sections, surely to maximize the cringe factor.

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,980
And the centerpiece of the entire presentation was an edited version of the documentary Story

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,920
of Access by Stanley Nelson.

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,960
Now, all of these videos and iPads described by the person who provided me with this info?

79
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
It turns out they're actually all privated videos on Starbucks' YouTube channel.

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,160
And the course content for this diversity training program?

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,140
It's all online, on the website StarbucksChannel.com, on a buried page inconspicuously titled The

82
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,440
Third Place.

83
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,800
This is just a hunch, I don't have any real evidence for this, but I have a feeling that

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,840
Starbucks knew it had to make this information public at some point, but decided to just

85
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,540
quietly publish it on a side site with privated materials in the hopes that nobody would actually

86
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
notice.

87
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,900
Thankfully, the SJW ghost town outlet known as Boing Boing stupidly embedded one of the

88
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,780
privated videos into an article, which is how I found all this hidden stuff in the first

89
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
place.

90
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,040
A video whose description linked back to The Third Place.

91
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,500
Why do I think they wanted to keep it quiet, though?

92
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,620
Because I've gone over the pamphlet, the videos, and the exam, and oh boy, it is all fucking

93
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
ridiculous.

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,940
But don't take my word for it.

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,200
Let's you and I take this diversity training course for ourselves, shall we?

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,760
So here's The Third Place, our commitment renewed.

97
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,920
It says it's a three minute read.

98
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,880
I have a feeling that it's probably not a three minute read.

99
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,720
On May 29th, we closed 8,000 Starbucks stores in the United States for four hours, so 175,000

100
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,600
Starbucks partners could come together for a conversation and learning session on racial

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
bias.

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,620
This was a foundational step in renewing Starbucks as a place where all people feel welcome.

103
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,740
Starbucks partners shared life experiences, heard from others, listened to experts on

104
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,920
bias and racial anxiety, reflecting on the realities of bias in our society and talking

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,200
about how all of us can work together to create public spaces where everyone feels like they

106
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
belong.

107
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,880
When they're talking about racial anxiety, I wonder if they actually brought up white

108
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,140
anxiety?

109
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,800
Our mission, because we want to uplift others, we exist.

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
No, what?

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,640
To inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a

112
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,540
Our values, because we want to deliver on our mission, we show up by creating a culture

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,140
of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome, acting with courage, challenging

114
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,940
the status quo and finding new ways to grow our company and each other, being present,

115
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,940
connecting with transparency, dignity, and respect, delivering our very best in all we

116
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,860
do, holding ourselves accountable for results.

117
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,580
So far, this just seems like a regular training bullshit program that you have to go through

118
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,220
any time you're a new employee, but it does get a bit juicier later.

119
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,360
Our mission and values, ground rules, why we're here today, practice, seeing difference

120
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,760
is positive, who we are, who we aspire to be, practice reflecting on what belonging

121
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:02,200
feels like, understanding bias, practice becoming color brave, color brave, okay, structural

122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:09,060
bias, practice envisioning belonging, making every customer feel they belong, practice,

123
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,840
see, respect, uplift, commitments, practice building new habits, okay, well, here's the

124
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,240
team guidebook, this guidebook was designed for groups of three to five Starbucks partners

125
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,880
to work through the relaying session at their own pace, okay, so basically what ended up

126
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,080
happening is they got groups of people together, they gave them an iPad and a team guidebook

127
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
and they had to basically follow a four hour training program and let's take a look at

128
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
this guidebook.

129
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,440
The first couple pages just seem to be the preamble redone, so there's 68 pages to this

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:45,620
thing, Jesus, okay, let's scroll through this here, there's our mission, the agenda, okay,

131
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,460
working together today, get into groups of three to five people, team up with people

132
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,940
you don't work closely with every day, team guidebook, one per team, iPad, please share

133
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:01,460
and be patient, come on now kids, you have to share and my notebook is 100% private except

134
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,380
when you hand in the my notebook to Starbucks management but we will get to the my notebook

135
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:12,000
section later, how to set up your iPad, find an available iPad, place it on the white rectangle

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,200
above, turn it on, so like they want you to actually insert the iPad into the book, okay,

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,680
also you have to lift the iPad to turn the page and it tells you right here, lift the

138
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,440
iPad, turn the page, so okay, let's keep going, ground rules, listen respectfully, speak your

139
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,960
truth and honour other people's truth, I'm not sure if they know the meaning of the word

140
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,080
truth, if your conversations get off track, pause and restart, yeah, don't have your own

141
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
thoughts here guys, just follow along, tips for getting back on track, say what you want

142
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,820
to pause, share what you're feeling, talk about it, in your working group for today

143
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,840
acknowledge it, we hear you, we hear you, we can't create a culture of warmth and belonging

144
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,400
if we don't first acknowledge that some of us deal with negative stereotypes every day,

145
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,160
we hear you, we can't connect with dignity and respect if we don't respect the different

146
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,760
starting points we all had in life, write it down in your notebook and revisit it later,

147
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,000
okay, this really feels like a grade 3 or a grade 4 social studies class man, video

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,080
1, Starbucks EVP Rosanne Williams, I'm showing your respect today, instructions, put an iPad

149
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,440
above, select video 1 on the iPad, so they want you to actually place the iPad in the

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,760
book and then play the video, I'm actually, I do have the videos down here, let's scroll

151
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,480
down a bit and here's video 1, let's watch it okay, just a YouTube embed, hello partners,

152
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,780
I wanted to share a few thoughts before you begin today, first of all, thank you in advance

153
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,240
for investing your time with one another, this is a needed conversation and one the

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,040
Starbucks family is more than capable of having, we are about creating a culture of warmth

155
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,760
and belonging where everyone is welcome, with that in mind, please remember a few things,

156
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,160
first listen respectfully, second speak with your truth and honour the truth of others,

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,760
third, if you need to take a moment, feel free to do so, conversations about race can

158
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,340
induce a feeling the experts call racial anxiety and when we're anxious, we can't always think

159
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,760
clearly, if this feeling starts to derail the conversation, there are a few things that

160
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,160
you can do as a group to get back on track, first let the group know you want to pause,

161
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
share what you're feeling in the most respectful way possible and then as a group, have a short

162
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,240
conversation about what was shared, remember to be present and listen with respect, this

163
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,320
is about you and your Starbucks family sharing this experience together, if you find you

164
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,100
need more support, please know that additional resources are available and more information

165
00:10:46,100 --> 00:11:01,820
can be found at the bottom of this page in this guidebook, wow, ok, I don't know, racial

166
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,180
anxiety, ok, let's keep going here, why we are here today, this is just a second video

167
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,620
isn't it, yeah it is, Starbucks president and CEO Kevin Johnson, why are we here today,

168
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,660
video 2, video 3, artist, author and activist comment, oh here's the rapper, on making others

169
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:28,300
feel welcome, ok, ok, ok, so hold on, videos 2 and 3 have to be watched now, let's enjoy

170
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:35,140
this a little bit, ok, so let us begin, we are here to make Starbucks a place where everyone,

171
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,780
everyone feels welcome, full stop, even if you don't pay guys, you're still welcome,

172
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,180
there is the immediate reason we are gathering, and that is the disheartening situation that

173
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:53,020
unfolded in Philadelphia, where two young men were arrested in a Starbucks store, but

174
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,020
the issue of racial bias and discrimination isn't just about us as a company, it is about

175
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:04,980
us as a country, prejudice and public accommodation is deeply rooted in America, and core to our

176
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:11,560
mission has always been being that third place where everyone feels welcome, but the reality

177
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,040
is being that third place in 2018 is far more challenging, current year, homelessness, substance

178
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,920
abuse in our bathrooms, mental illness, these are all issues that a good portion, substance abuse in

179
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,200
your bathrooms, do you think that's going to get better or worse if you start allowing people in

180
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,320
who haven't bought anything, and you can just let them in, what do you think man, what do you think,

181
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,400
if you face each and every day, yet my hope in gathering us is that Starbucks can become a place

182
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:48,840
of welcoming, of warmth, and of inclusion for all, now given the state of race relations in this

183
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:56,720
country, it's easy to wonder if inclusion for all is even possible, here's my belief, growing up this

184
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,480
term called colorblind, described a learning behavior of pretending not to notice race, that

185
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:11,240
doesn't even make sense, so today we're starting a new journey, talking about race directly, what my

186
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:19,480
friend and Starbucks board member Melody Hobson calls being color brave, oh color brave, that's

187
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,000
what it means, okay, okay, okay, so here's, here's the deal, here's the deal, no longer are we expected

188
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,160
to treat people equally regardless of their skin color, we have to be color brave, we have to

189
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,760
understand that I guess the darkies need to be treated differently because they're not white,

190
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,520
is that what you're saying here, Starbucks CEO, so here is what we will do together today,

191
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,400
we'll begin by welcoming each other and by sharing who we are and having curiosity about others,

192
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,680
we will explore America's history of prejudice in public spaces and we will learn about bias,

193
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,920
where it comes from, and that it's a normal part of each person, and we'll talk about some ways

194
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,880
that we can work together to help others feel welcome, to feel included, to feel valued,

195
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,040
even in those situations where customers may not treat us in the same way,

196
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,760
and please keep this in mind, you are not alone, we know that for every, I'm just gonna stop here,

197
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,160
I've been to some gender studies classes in the past, this seems remarkably like that,

198
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,960
so let's move on to video three here, I do want to see what our rapper has to say about this,

199
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:40,120
I am grateful to be with you Starbucks partners today because this work is close to my heart,

200
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:48,440
helping people see each other fully, completely, respectfully, my role throughout this day is to

201
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,880
get us started in good conversation, let's start first by appreciating each other,

202
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,800
I know that for me welcoming people in my life starts first with sharing who I am and then

203
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,640
listening closely to where someone else is coming from, who they are, what they are proud of,

204
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:15,400
what makes them them, now usually when we do this kind of thing in our everyday lives in America,

205
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,680
we try to find similarity between people, we try to find ways in which we are alike,

206
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,360
and that's good, yet it turns out there's also great advantage in your work, in your life,

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,320
in your relationships, to learn to love what makes you different from someone else,

208
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,800
to seek out how someone is different, and that is what makes them interesting,

209
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,440
it's a life skill to make someone else in your presence feel welcome, you do that by not only

210
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,880
loving what makes them the same as you, but by appreciating what makes them different than you,

211
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,240
now you're going to hear from Starbucks partners who will guide you through the day,

212
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,840
to start building the life skill of appreciating people's differences,

213
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:07,080
get your notebook out and turn to what makes me, me, and you, you, it should be at the front of

214
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,000
your book, this guy really seems like he was told to do this or he was going to be fired,

215
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,360
yeah let's just get back to this, let's get back to the the actual pamphlet here that we got,

216
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,520
we have like 63 pages here Jesus, seeing what makes us unique and different, grab your notebook,

217
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,520
pair it with somebody in your group, this really is grade school shit,

218
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,840
open your notebook to page four to the activity what makes me, me, and you, you, when you're done

219
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:44,360
return to the team guidebook to discuss with the group, holy shit man I'm legit having childhood

220
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,320
flashbacks, discuss with your team which pair found the most differences, how did you find

221
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,120
so many, what questions did you ask, how did you ask them, now that you see the other person you

222
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,320
talk to more clearly, what new information do you appreciate about them, man what if someone

223
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:06,680
is like I don't want to talk about my personal life in this exercise, I came here to do a job,

224
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,000
I want to get paid and go home, are they going to be like no you must tell me about all your

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,240
differences, do you really got to get into this shit, take a 15-minute break it's been fucking

226
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:22,200
grueling guys, Starbucks who we are, who we aspire to be, oh god do you really want to watch all

227
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,680
these videos, how many videos are there, let me just see this here, three, four, five, what it

228
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:42,840
feels like to belong, seven, eight, now whole, holy shit, oh my, I can't believe actually having to

229
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:51,560
have done this, Jesus, I'm sorry Starbucks employees, these audio clips seem to be like

230
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,200
examples, okay hold on, confusion about a customer's gender, let's listen to this,

231
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,360
seems to be an audio sample of what to do, so I was working in the store one weekend and we were

232
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,120
a store that's on a transit line, the bus dropped off right in front of our store and then every

233
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,680
time every bus let out everybody'd come in, get some coffee, want to use the bathroom because

234
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,920
they're in the midst of a trip, we had one customer come in specifically who asked for

235
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,680
the men's restroom key and that's where we had two separate keys, one was blue for the men's and the

236
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,120
other one was pink for the women's, they asked for the men's key and we handed them the women's key

237
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,160
because although the individual identified male they looked female to us working behind the

238
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,960
counter, the customer then said no I really identify male and I've asked you for the men's key

239
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,400
so we handed them the men's key and said hey we're really sorry that that happened,

240
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,040
here's the key that you asked for, go ahead and you can go around the corner to the to the

241
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:57,000
bathroom, our bathroom was in a shared building so when the customer went into the main building

242
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,320
they were actually told by security that they weren't even allowed to access the men's room

243
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,040
because the building said that they didn't believe that they were a male either, which

244
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,600
point the customer came back in and became very irate, we told them we were really sorry

245
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:18,680
that we'd done the best we could at that point in time. Absolutely harrowing, I mean it does sound

246
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,800
like a terrible inconvenience that they might have to go to a restroom that they don't really

247
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:31,960
identify with and take their shit there. Women with dirty cup asks for refill, how, okay.

248
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:45,800
Okay so one morning a lady came in she was wearing a sweat and she had a paper cup our Starbucks cup

249
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,280
and she said she wants to get a coffee, a cup of coffee refill and

250
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:02,760
but the cup was really dirty and has like a lot of stains on it and so I said when did you,

251
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,200
when did you get this coffee, when did you get the first cup and she said this morning

252
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:19,240
but the fact that the coffee cup was really dirty I said to her that she cannot get a refill.

253
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,680
Okay that actually sounds reasonable because it seems like maybe this person had like found a cup

254
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,960
that was old or had a cup from several days ago that had kind of gone through the wear and tear

255
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:39,160
and was no longer entitled to a refill. Why is this part of this package?

256
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:46,120
Women in dirty sweatpants lingering near retail cups. There was a woman in dirty sweatpants

257
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,880
lingering near retail cups. There was a busy morning at my store back in downtown

258
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,720
where a lady came in and her sweatpants had stains in them and they also had holes

259
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,160
so I quickly told my partners like hey I'm gonna switch over to warming so that I can keep my eye

260
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,600
on her and I noticed her going back and forth back and forth from the retail cups it was during

261
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:26,120
Christmas so we had all the red box cups and she I assumed she was going to steal and I approached

262
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,600
her and I said would you like any help with anything and turns out that she wanted to buy one

263
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:43,800
as a gift. Okay as somebody who has worked retail in the past you do get to know the the body

264
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,680
language and the behaviors of people who are trying to shoplift. Recognizing those patterns

265
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,400
is not a bad thing. Jesus I can't believe this where do these where do all these clips show up

266
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,160
in this thing I gotta scroll back up and see this hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on

267
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:08,680
okay okay fuck the team guidebook here we go page 50 making every customer feel like they

268
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,800
belong at Starbucks listen to all the audios every human must be seen respected and uplifted

269
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,160
whether or not they're customers oh shit you have to like seen respected it like fill out one of

270
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,840
these for each for each scenario oh wow okay well here here's here's what we can do to make

271
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,480
these vagrants in our store feel welcome let's get back back to where we were a little bit here

272
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,240
I don't know if I want to go through all this guys like holy shit there's a lot of

273
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,520
nonsense here however however I did realize that video six is colorblind to color brave

274
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,480
so let's watch that one all right I want to get to it with the hard question how do you define

275
00:22:52,040 --> 00:23:01,640
bias what is it so bias is our brains look at this incredibly diverse panel automatic association

276
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,120
and processing of negative stereotypes about certain groups of people so that sounds somewhat

277
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:15,000
clinical if you could break it down even further so when we talk about bias we're actually talking

278
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,680
about two kinds of bias there's explicit bias which is when we are very consciously do not

279
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:27,960
particularly care for a group the implicit bias is when our brains have made associations about

280
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,360
a particular group negative stereotypes about a particular group that have become embedded in our

281
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,840
brains over time so how do you know it when you're doing it how do you know it when you see it hold

282
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,600
on hold on hold on what matters here isn't necessarily the bias it's the behavior explicit

283
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:49,880
bias can obviously be a problem because it actually leads to explicit behaviors um implicit

284
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:56,360
bias almost never generates itself as behavior like if you if you feel a certain way about a

285
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:03,080
particular race or or a particular gender or a particular type of person and it's implicit

286
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:11,000
and you don't act on it and your behavior doesn't change then what what harm's been done are unless

287
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
of course you want to thoughtfully everybody you want to control what people think how about going

288
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,200
at it that way you often don't know it when you're doing it because if it's an implicit bias that

289
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,360
means you have it in the back of your brain you're not conscious of it and in fact it can be

290
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,800
completely inconsistent with your actual beliefs so oftentimes the risk is you in fact don't know

291
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,440
when you're making an automatic association do you think our company should be one of those

292
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,440
institutions that helps people understand their biases do you think that's the job of a of a

293
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:47,640
company like ours if we're going no we're going to have a business where we're interfacing with

294
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,960
the public i think we're responsible to help a workforce navigate these nuances and relationships

295
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,320
and human connection personally i've realized i have a big beard i have a line in my head

296
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,720
that that smile of hers back there that was her saying you just kept your job son i can be

297
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,680
capable i can be competent and i can lead people and i can you know be an individual an individual

298
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,680
as long as you think the right way compassion empathy i think those are great places to start

299
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,640
so a lot of people talk about being colorblind what is it about color blindness that creates

300
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,800
a problem here we go our brains can't not see people's different racial categories that's the

301
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,240
way we've grown up to evaluate people so we can't turn that off and this is something that fred

302
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,960
talked about beautifully it seems to me from what i hear from my friends who are people of color

303
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,480
they don't want me to not see them as their full selves and for many if it's something that we

304
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,000
can't change you can't be colorblind it is impossible for humanity or individual humans

305
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,560
to be colorblind then what's the point what's the point of any of this i mean if we are stuck as

306
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,600
these miserable wretches who are always destined to be racist then what is the point of all this

307
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,160
just just fucking give up people their full selves involves a sense of racial identity

308
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:16,200
help me understand as practitioners how you explain to people what implicit bias is so that

309
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,160
they can start to recognize it we usually start by having people understand how their

310
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,200
unconscious brain works so we have an exercise that we could do that would give us all a chance

311
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,400
to see what it means to have your unconscious brain overcome your conscious brain okay how does

312
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,440
it work sure okay okay i'm going to give you what is called a stroup test so in order to talk about

313
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,400
bias it's really important to understand how our brains operate unconsciously we're going to take

314
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,960
the stroup test which was invented by dr stroup in 1935 it's a group activity so i want you all

315
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:58,440
to state the color of the text let's try one together blue blue did you all say blue together

316
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:06,840
great let the test begin oh jesus it's gonna be one of these eh it's gonna be a thing where like

317
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,560
it it'll change yeah yeah see see what it's doing see what it's doing it's going faster and faster

318
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:21,240
and it's having a word but a different color so for example this says red but it's actually black

319
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:31,640
and you're reading you're not looking at color um what this has to do with fucking racism i have

320
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,960
no clue at my store i have a transit uh gentleman um his name is steve he comes in every day but

321
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,800
he's a customer um but his appearance um is that of somebody who lives on the street my initial

322
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,320
response was i don't know this guy uh he's not really supporting the atmosphere that i want to

323
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:57,160
have in here um but i had to check that and engage and just watch you know and and talk and and now

324
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,360
we're good friends um does steve buy anything because that's really what matters it doesn't

325
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,160
matter that you guys are friends it doesn't matter how he dresses what matters is that

326
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:18,360
he comes in with money and buys coffee that's it and he comes in there all the time this is

327
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,600
the type of moments that we're trying to create so tell me about the difference between personal

328
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:29,160
bias which i think which is a lot of people feel the weight of and feel the shame of

329
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,480
and structural bias if you think about kind of where someone lives where they go to school

330
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,440
the transportation system that helps them get there all of those systems all those places of

331
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,800
how we just navigate our daily life in today's very segregated society some people have been

332
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:53,480
afforded access other people haven't wait today's very segregated society one america has not been

333
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,120
segregated for some time now two with all this talk of not being colorblind and recognizing

334
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,400
differences that's creating segregation that rapper from earlier talked all about focusing

335
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,000
on differences and not how they're the same how is that not a segregating force in society you

336
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,520
talk about this idea of racial anxiety what is that racial anxiety is our our bodies are in our

337
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,160
brain stress response to cross-racial interaction and it shows up differently if i'm a person of

338
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,360
color and i'm engaging in across racial interaction i'm worried that whatever's coming towards me my

339
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,240
defense mechanism goes up right and if you're white it's showing up as a big fear that you

340
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,520
may confirm yourself as racist you may say something or do something okay oh oh oh so so

341
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,360
here here's racial anxiety if you're white you're afraid you're going to be outed as a racist if

342
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:54,920
you're a non-white or a person of color you fear for your life you fear i i don't know like it

343
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,600
couldn't it couldn't possibly be the other way around could it it couldn't it couldn't possibly

344
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:07,240
be that a white person fears a black person or that a non-white person fears being outed as racist

345
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,240
and really you're just talking about whites and non-whites like everything that's non-white is

346
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,240
just one giant category how how do jewish people fit into this how do asians fit into this how do

347
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,840
native people fit into this none of this really seems to make any sense but the racial anxiety

348
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,400
actually helps us understand that that interpersonal work that we need to do is really one of the key

349
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,880
things that's getting in the way why is bias bad for business if there are any groups who feel like

350
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,200
they're not treated as well who feel like they're being othered as our colleague john powell would

351
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,600
say and don't have that sense of belonging that starbucks talks about that's bad for business

352
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,880
something else you said that's really important is how the partners feel obviously well see that's

353
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,960
where capitalism steps in in a purely capitalistic system it would not matter your race or gender or

354
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,880
anything else the only thing that matters is whether or not you have the money to buy something

355
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,160
at starbucks so you can be a homeless man with money come in buy your coffee you're welcome there

356
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,080
you can be a black person come in buy your coffee you're welcome there you can be

357
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,200
any type of human if you have money you're welcome in the store those two black guys who were

358
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,720
arrested they didn't buy anything which is why this isn't a race issue which is why this entire

359
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,240
exercise is pointless starbucks actually has a very multi-racial multi-ethnic multi-religious

360
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,360
staff and so in order for the people who are partners to be their best selves they need to

361
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:47,800
feel supported so today when we close down our stores to get more training and hopefully come

362
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:55,560
away with more learnings around bias explicit and implicit structural and personal can we structurally

363
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,680
change the organization through something like this some are skeptical so i think we would say

364
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,000
the structural work is something that has to be done for far longer than the four-hour day

365
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,800
and that's policy that's the work the company has to do to support the partners in the individual

366
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,880
work and the teamwork that they do within here's what sjws often mean when they say structure when

367
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,240
they talk about structures they say this is something that needs to be constantly reinforced

368
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,240
and that's why it's going to take longer than this four-hour program it's an ideology that needs to

369
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:32,280
be hammered in every day because if it's not people are going to realize that it's bullshit

370
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,640
their institutions because one of the things we don't want to see is for each person to have

371
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,680
to bear this burden alone and also so the partners can themselves be treated respectfully by each

372
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,080
other because the partners can be on the receiving end of all this as well fred anything that you

373
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:52,200
think we could leave behind for our partners as they think about bias if they had one takeaway

374
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,760
that could help them be better assuming everyone wants to be better at this with the third place

375
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,800
in the human connections that we're trying to make when you feel like there's uh there's an

376
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,160
there's something uncomfortable happening let's listen let's take that moment that pause um to

377
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,480
listen and and sort of center ourselves the other piece is body language if we can feel comfortable

378
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,760
enough to come from around our counter um to actually connect with that person who is

379
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,840
disappointed or maybe we had a perceived bias about but we're going to listen we're going to

380
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,920
be present our body language is not going to be this but we're going to be here we're going to

381
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,680
be present for that conversation i think that begins to open up a world of opportunity when we

382
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,240
when we talk about connection and we want to be in a space that's respectful with them and not

383
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,920
come in with preconceived or structural or stereotypical notions about the individual

384
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:53,960
thank you thanks very much wow that told me nothing jesus christ i'm not going through

385
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,880
this pamphlet anymore there's a few things i want to check out though before we uh we finish up this

386
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,440
this training exercise today here guys i want to watch video eight because this is the stanley

387
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,520
nelson documentary and i do want to check out one more thing after this so let's watch this

388
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,840
documentary first a stanley nelson story of access this independently created film by stanley nelson

389
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,760
was underwritten by starbucks with the intent of educating our partners about the history of access

390
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,840
to public spaces for african americans this film explores the impact of bias within public

391
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,760
accommodations as well as the possibilities for a better future dear starbucks partners

392
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:35,240
i'm stanley nelson a documentary filmmaker my films are about race america and the decades long

393
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:43,320
struggle for all people to be treated as equals in public spaces our town squares our stores our

394
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:52,360
fields our parks our pools our restaurants congratulations you have it now and have had it

395
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:59,080
for some time i made this film to help us understand this important struggle in our country

396
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,800
so we can go forward together

397
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:15,640
when i go into stores sometimes i get followed which is really annoying and it just gives me

398
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,320
like it just makes me uncomfortable and sometimes i get anxiety so i have to leave

399
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,840
oh geez i'm i'm sorry that your anxiety your anxiety is what makes you leave i gotta be honest

400
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,480
i'm a white guy and sometimes i i've gone into stores and i've been followed too

401
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,640
and as a retail worker you know sometimes you you you notice somebody maybe maybe their body

402
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,000
language has been off maybe they're doing something odd maybe you at the very least

403
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,240
want to keep an eye on them to make sure that they're not going to steal and it's it's been

404
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,440
in my experience less about race and more about how people present themselves you know i've i've

405
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,800
seen white shoplifters and i've seen native shoplifters here in canada and and i've never

406
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,120
shoplifted however i have had employees of stores follow me around and it's it's obvious that they're

407
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,640
following me around because they're not really that sneaky but they're following me around

408
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,080
like they think i'm going to shoplift and it's not a race thing especially being a teen of color

409
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,320
they assume that you're doing something bad i feel like i'm disturbing people by just being there

410
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:31,400
like people feel uncomfortable when i walk in i guess i've kind of become numb to it after so

411
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,080
many years like this is just my life and it's just something that i've gotten used to unfortunately

412
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:43,800
i think all of us make that choice at some point of am i going to take the burden of this

413
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,840
interaction being comfortable or am i going to say you take the burden of this interaction

414
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,920
being comfortable who goes into a social interaction thinking that way really who starts

415
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,960
talking to somebody with the presumption that if you don't do something this is going to be

416
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,200
uncomfortable like holy shit because what i really want is a sandwich do you know what i mean i don't

417
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,960
want to fight i'm hungry right i don't want to get into this with you and i'm really not here to

418
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:20,280
teach you this but other time then why are you here it's like okay wait a minute lesson time

419
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:30,520
discrimination against african americans in public spaces has a long history in the 1960s

420
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:38,760
black and white students trying to desegregate buses were firebombed it was terrible thankfully

421
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,560
we've moved past it black patrons were routinely denied service in restaurants and hotels

422
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,520
it was terrible thankfully we've moved past it as long as you have the money to actually

423
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,800
pay for your stuff though not at starbucks apparently

424
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,960
and civil rights workers were dragged from lunch counters spat upon and beaten

425
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:16,040
we're willing to be beaten for democracy and you must use democracy the right to be respected in

426
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,640
public spaces was at the heart of the civil rights movement

427
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:32,200
they keep thinking we begging them for something we ain't begging for nothing we're telling them

428
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,280
see the difference between these clips and what's going on at starbucks is that these people are

429
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,480
actually confronting a legitimate problem in the society in which they lived the two guys at

430
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,480
starbucks went in didn't order anything and were asked to leave and then they didn't and then the

431
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,040
cops were called on them this is this is not illegal this is not a situation of them being

432
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,280
arrested because they're black this is not a situation of misuse of police power frankly it

433
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,320
almost denigrates the sacrifice of these people from the 1960s by comparing it to this ridiculous

434
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:21,960
bullshit happening today the freedom movement of the 1950s and 60s insisted that the united states

435
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,120
live up to its constitution and allow equal access for all

436
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:36,120
finally the civil rights act of 1964 was passed outlawing discrimination in public spaces

437
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,600
but changing the law doesn't always change

438
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,040
reality and being allowed in doesn't always mean being welcomed

439
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:54,920
to be welcomed as a customer means that not only do i allow you in but it means that i'm glad

440
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,200
you're here i i want to serve you i want your business and i don't draw distinctions between

441
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,520
you and other customers in terms yes yes yes i don't draw distinctions between you and other

442
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:15,640
customers not you and other people you and other customers the implication is that you've paid for

443
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,680
a good or a service in terms of your value but it's time we talk about what it means

444
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,680
to not be welcomed as an american citizen it's not like i can mute my actual physical blackness

445
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:47,160
right so i just i mean according to this chinese laundry commercial you you probably could

446
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:07,160
do

447
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,520
assume that people see a particular thing when they see the color of my skin so everything else

448
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:36,600
has to be like perfect and clean and as blended in as possible is no you just you just have to

449
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:42,120
have money you just have to go into a starbucks with money and be willing to buy something

450
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:49,400
that's all no nobody cares about anything else really just an arsenal of different masks

451
00:41:49,960 --> 00:42:00,120
you know is one of those masks made of money um and it happens every time i

452
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,800
every time i leave my house when i leave my house regardless of where i'm going the

453
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,640
i'm just leaving my house just walking out the door i don't i'm not walking out the door thinking

454
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,720
what kind of hurdle am i going to run into today what kind of way am i going to be judged i walk

455
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:29,560
out a free man i just okay okay um on the one hand i see what this guy is saying because people

456
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:35,560
and i assume this is also the case for people who have not internalized their own goddamn racism

457
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:42,200
towards themselves so like you know kanye west for example people like that they probably just

458
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,800
walk out the door thinking yeah you know whatever i gotta go out and do something i'm gonna go out

459
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:53,000
and do it um at the same time everyone and i mean everyone regardless of race will go out the door

460
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,320
and think how they're going to be judged that's why you comb your hair well if you if you had

461
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,560
hair i assume you'd comb it that's why you don't wear dirty clothes that's why you shower before

462
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,680
you go outside you get judged for a lot more than race and and honestly you get judged for some

463
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,320
things way harsher than race man i mean jordan peterson said it best would you rather be ugly

464
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:17,640
or be an immigrant just do my thing i have to make sure that i have given enough space between

465
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,600
myself and another patron or another uh commuter on the train just ensure that i'm not making

466
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,960
someone uncomfortable i have to make sure they're my hand man man i do that too when i'm on the bus

467
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,800
unless the bus is packed i'm not going to just jam myself beside somebody it's not about your

468
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,040
skin color it's about not being rude things are visible when i walk into certain places so they

469
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:46,600
make sure i don't not stealing um i try to make sure i make eye contact with people who may or may

470
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:52,760
not be security or managerial staff just ensure that you know i'm not here to hide anything uh

471
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,280
i watch my tone to make sure that i don't come off as threatening just leaving the house some days you

472
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:06,280
know it's it's it sounds it sounds so terrible that you have to be a decent human being in public

473
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,440
you know because these are all things that i also do as a white person and that i assume

474
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,480
most decent people do it's called not being a dick don't just keep you at home and just keep

475
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:29,240
you away from everything for more than 50 years equal treatment has been the law yet as we know

476
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,800
from cell phone videos the nightly news and maybe our own experience we still have a long way to go

477
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,880
why are you following yeah yeah i mean it's it's really terrible there are individuals out there

478
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,560
who are assholes and if you want to like catch them on video put it on youtube and say this guy's

479
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,560
an asshole go ahead i'll probably laugh at it at some point when i come across it

480
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,520
but that's pretty much the extent of it this is not some kind of systemic problem

481
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,160
watch this

482
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:09,960
you think i'm stealing your card is fake you're going to jail that's what i kept

483
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:33,720
we just okay okay so some of these instances are going to be legitimate police brutality

484
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,840
and obviously that's not a good thing i mean we don't even have to really go down that road do we

485
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,480
but at the same time how many of these people do you think turned it into a race issue like the

486
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,880
police had a legitimate reason to arrest one of these people or at the very least talk to them

487
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,960
about something and they just said oh you're doing this because i'm black and then escalated it and

488
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,360
then it turned into a shit show like do you think that that might have happened once or twice indeed

489
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,680
that black people are navigating the public space differently than white people

490
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,440
and how much of that is their own choice really how many didn't do nothing do you think are

491
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,080
actually out there how many good boys just going to college that women are navigating the public

492
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:16,280
space differently than men and not use the shortcut that has been wired into your brain

493
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,960
because of the society that we live in that tells you when you see me you should be nervous

494
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:29,640
or you should be worried it i'm not nervous or worried i'm just stunned brought me such despair

495
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:39,000
to the day i recognized i had to explain this to my son that he was gonna that that this muddy

496
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,200
river of racism he was still gonna have to walk through it we hadn't damned it we hadn't dried

497
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,080
it up it was still there for him to go through and i've got to somehow try to tell him okay

498
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:57,880
off you go maybe if you didn't keep focusing on your differences maybe maybe if the black

499
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,560
community wasn't ridiculously belligerent when it came to police interaction maybe if black fathers

500
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:09,320
actually stuck around their families then you wouldn't have this muddy river of racism but you

501
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,760
know what at this point i think it's safe to say that at least a fair chunk of it is definitely the

502
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:22,600
black community's own doing the society i want to see is i want to be able to walk out the house

503
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:28,600
just as free feeling as that white guy who said he doesn't worry about a thing when he walks out

504
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:34,040
the door i want well that's on you isn't it how you feel isn't that your responsibility if you

505
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,240
were to say i want to walk out the door as free as a white guy well you have that now don't you

506
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,640
but free feeling well that's on you it's not anybody else's responsibility to make you feel

507
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:51,560
better want to have that same expectation today discrimination is against the law

508
00:47:52,680 --> 00:48:00,200
it's the people and the systems that support our communities that must follow suit yes absolutely

509
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:07,480
changing the law is not enough we also must force people to change we must force a cultural change

510
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:14,520
everything is racist everything is sexist and you must point it all out no one's going to do it for

511
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:23,000
us what can you do to make our schools our parks our stores our restaurants as welcoming and as

512
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:31,640
inclusive as they can be um treat oh dude she's a cutie um treat people equally that is really why

513
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,640
capitalism is probably the best system for equality because it simply says if you have

514
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:44,440
money you are welcome and race and gender and none of that nonsense actually matters

515
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,640
what kind of country do we want to live in who do we want to be

516
00:48:51,640 --> 00:49:04,440
okay well i regret doing this let's uh let's turn this piece of shit off the last thing i want to go

517
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,960
to is the my notebook now this is where employees have to actually fill this out a space for your

518
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,960
private thoughts however you're expected to give it back to starbucks management so it's not really

519
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,640
private is it what makes me me and you you this is the first exercise they had to do similarities

520
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,880
bond us together yet being able to perceive what makes us unique and different from each other

521
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,760
gives us the gift of seeing each other as full human beings pair up with somebody on your team

522
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,080
keep time using your phone how classless of starbucks to assume everyone has a phone try

523
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,480
to find as many ways as you can that you are different from each other okay so again focus

524
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:44,360
on differences generate that segregation in your life where do you feel a sense of belonging feeling

525
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,160
welcome feeling included feeling like yourself well really the only place where you have a right

526
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,840
to feel a sense of belonging is in your own house frankly that's pretty much it the first step to

527
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:00,440
becoming color brave read through the following pages take your time seeing how bias operates

528
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:07,320
takes reflection and introspection our unconscious brain processes 11 million bits of information a

529
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:15,160
second in that same time our conscious brain processes only 40 bits thus we process more

530
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,360
unconsciously than consciously well i'm sure that anybody can work out this math

531
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:26,520
without the third sentence there but uh this sounds like some ridiculous bullshit right here

532
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:32,680
okay 11 million bits from information a second let me just let me just work this out 11 11 million

533
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:45,800
bits in gigabytes okay it's 1.375 okay in in megabytes 1.3 megs okay so let's say that our

534
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:53,000
unconscious brain processes 1.3 megs of information a second only 40 bits in our conscious brain i i

535
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,360
don't think this is true forget about the the ridiculousness of measuring human brain capacity

536
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:05,960
in in a computer term like like bits but only 40 bits okay that's five bytes what can you store

537
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:14,200
in five bytes of memory if i can think of a word in my conscious brain that is say 15 letters long

538
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:21,400
some long ass word i'm already storing more than five bytes right if i can think of a song is is

539
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,760
one second of remembered song more than five bytes i think it might be look how stupid this

540
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,080
is already okay let's keep going though jesus christ our brains do this because they must if

541
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,400
we had to process everything consciously the day would be so exhausting we'd never get through it

542
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,360
to help us function our brains take shortcuts when shortcuts are applied to the characteristics

543
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:46,360
traits and behaviors of a certain group of people they are called stereotypes there's no way this is

544
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:52,040
scientifically accurate there is no way this is actually how the psychology works stereotypes are

545
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,200
shaped by the things we take in around us much of it comes through the media but also our experiences

546
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,040
and the broader culture we live in so is this starbucks admitting that stereotypes actually

547
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:06,360
have a basis of truth in them maybe the risk is that when we hold negative stereotypes unconscious

548
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,640
bias can arise when we're under pressure are short on time or don't pay attention unconscious

549
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,000
biases are triggered more easily we can hold biases about race and age and religion gender

550
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,760
and sexuality and body type ability and mental health and class and many other attributes

551
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,800
i just have to straight up agree here i mean my monk in dnd might be really really fat but

552
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,440
you can't have a bias based on his body type he can flip bears over man that's why it's important

553
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,600
that we learn about how our biases are framed what we can do to override them biases are not always

554
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,120
easy to identify they make us feel exposed maybe even critical of ourselves but they're worth

555
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,920
reflecting on this is basically where they say you might feel that hunch of rationality saying

556
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:50,440
this doesn't really uh this doesn't really make sense but it's important that you ignore that

557
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,720
for the greater good of social justice when we address our emotions as they relate to our biases

558
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:01,880
we build the muscle that helps us override them let's try it now the first time you recall when

559
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,480
you first experienced your racial identity it may have been when you were a child it may have been

560
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,800
last week if a scenario doesn't apply to you feel free to leave it blank and move on to the next one

561
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:16,040
when you notice your racial identity noticed how your race affected your beauty standards

562
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,880
felt your accent impacted people's perception of your intelligence or competence

563
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,480
altered your communication style to avoid playing into stereotypes what if i just said

564
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,400
i don't feel comfortable talking about this i mean these had to be collected right am i going to get

565
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,760
fired for that had a friend of a different race who regularly visited your home if your group

566
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,840
doesn't contain a token black person i guess you're a racist imagine you're meeting two

567
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,240
different people for the first time one of them is of your race the other one is of a different race

568
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,800
without thinking too much don't think about it guys just select the level of difficulty that

569
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:55,240
reflects how you might react in each instance i'm gonna assume that most people you know most

570
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:01,720
casual western liberals are gonna put the same marker for people of your race and people of not

571
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,440
not of your race oh there's a glossary in here let's let's check this shit out belonging an

572
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,080
authentic feeling of empowerment and participation in a group experienced in a person feels safe

573
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:17,640
valued and accepted discrimination the unequal treatment of members of various groups based on

574
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:24,600
race gender social class sexual orientation physical ability religion and other categories

575
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,800
now it doesn't really say whether or not that unequal treatment is good or bad whether it's

576
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,040
deserved or not whether it's proper or not because there are certainly instances where

577
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,840
discrimination is actually a good thing think about it this way the most discriminating act

578
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:45,400
that any one person can do is be in a monogamous relationship right because you're saying that

579
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:51,080
i'm only having sex with this person and you are discriminating against everybody else do

580
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:57,240
we want our sexuality to be equalized now too i mean at some point you do have to choose one

581
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,200
thing over another and if that's always going to be discrimination and that's always going to be

582
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:08,360
bad then society basically breaks down exclusion the process or state of being set apart from other

583
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:14,840
people or things well yes i mean i'm going to exclude you from my relationship with my girlfriend

584
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,360
i'm going to exclude you from my store if you don't buy things and therefore are not a customer

585
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:25,480
the terminology presented in this in this key terms page is simply presented like it's supposed

586
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:31,560
to be negative when it's actually quite neutral institutional racism the ways in which institutional

587
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:37,320
policies and practices create different outcomes for different racial groups creating unbalanced

588
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,680
advantages for whites along with oppression and disadvantages for people from groups classified

589
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:49,960
as non-white so would you say for example that when black fathers leave their kids in a single

590
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,800
parent household at alarming rates that's institutional racism because that would be a

591
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,240
practice of the black community you know an institutional almost practice of the black

592
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,960
community that creates a different outcome for a different racial group with the benefit of a

593
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:12,200
stable family that whites have being some form of privilege i guess you could say racial equity

594
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:19,080
the aspirational condition that would be achieved if one's racial identity no longer predicted in a

595
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:26,840
statistical sense how one fares so it's not it's not equality guys it's equity if it's equality

596
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:32,040
well then everyone gets a fair shake and then these various things like say black fathers not

597
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,840
sticking around to raise their kids well i mean that that's the choice of the black father and

598
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:41,640
well i guess that means that the black kids start a little bit behind in life but it is still equal

599
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,840
because they had the choice not to do that but racial equity means that society must fill in

600
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:52,280
those gaps no matter the cost well once you've filled out that private workbook and handed it

601
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,480
off to starbucks management for further inspection interrogation of any possible wrong think you can

602
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:06,440
then watch the final video called sticking with it to be color brave is to be brave period whether

603
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,920
it was easy or hard for you today above all thank you for choosing to be here we began some very

604
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:22,680
important conversations today but let's be clear this is just the beginning it's a start and now

605
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:28,040
more than ever the world needs the third place a place where everyone feels they can belong

606
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,440
and this starts by first understanding that we each have biases and then actively working to

607
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,800
address them but there's more that we can do to create the third place consistent with our mission

608
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:46,360
and values we can seek and eradicate bias and racism in our systems we can work to change our

609
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:53,000
policies and processes and we can each commit to work on ourselves the more you are aware of your

610
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,880
bias the more you can work to disrupt it and help all people who walk into a starbucks to feel seen

611
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:08,440
to feel respected to feel uplifted my biggest ask is that every single one of us commit to this

612
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,920
journey we won't get it right every single time but if we stay at this we will get it right more

613
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:21,080
and more so thank you for everything you brought to today i am so proud to call you my partner

614
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,560
and i'm especially proud that we are on this journey together

615
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:33,480
you know what after that i feel culturally enriched i feel like i should allow a bunch

616
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:38,120
of belligerent people into my local starbucks who have no interest in buying anything and

617
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,920
no reason to be there except to take a steaming shit on the tables because they've got the right

618
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:48,200
skin color i want to live my life safe and secure in the fact that if i ever get a job i'm going to

619
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:54,120
be led into a closed room strapped into a chair for four hours and spoon-fed videos on how racist

620
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:59,720
and sexist i am by the company's ceo this is the bright future that i want and starbucks's ceo is

621
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,520
paving the way for this to be a universal oh do you think i'm joking about that you know how

622
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,440
schultz resigned as ceo from starbucks right around the time this whole shit storm started

623
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,560
well written in an article by usa today is this passage schultz's ideology has dipped into the

624
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,600
political sphere too his outspokenness on issues such as gay rights and refugees has fueled

625
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:23,160
speculation that he's looking to run for office perhaps president starbucks didn't comment about

626
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:28,280
plans that he's seeking elected office in his letter he didn't rule it out saying i'll be

627
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,000
thinking about a range of options for myself from philanthropy to public service but i'm a long way

628
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,240
from knowing what the future holds yeah schultz doesn't know what the future holds my ass remember

629
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:42,520
when hillary said she wasn't going to run for 2016 way back when i do i can already see the campaign

630
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:48,600
slogan schultz 2020 diversity ipads in every home i'd end this by saying the usual vote with your

631
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,680
wallet in regards to starbucks but i don't think that's going to work this time the people at the

632
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,000
top of starbucks would rather open their doors wide like a homeless shelter instead of actually

633
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,480
exercising their rights all because somebody called them racist they've deliberately chosen

634
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:15,240
to lose money for the sake of social justice all we can do now is wait for the end

635
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,280
so
