00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello everyone, welcome to TikTok Tuesday. Before we get going, I want to announce two things just

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,080
very quickly. If you're watching this on release, I'll be streaming. I'm doing a Euro-friendly

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,920
gaming stream for once, which will be starting around 1pm my time, 6pm BritBonger time. And

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,400
secondly, the reason I'm doing that is because I'm going on WIC-TV's channel tonight. I'm going

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
to do another interview, I think with Brianna Wu again. There's always more things to talk about.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,440
It always feels good to occasionally dip my toes into the Twitch politics sphere. So after you've

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,880
watched this video, please go and check those out. I really appreciate it. Let's get on with

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800
the TikToks though. What have you guys sent me this week? Oh wait, wait, there's music. Hold on.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Okay. Decided I'm going to misgender my entire family on Thanksgiving so they know how it feels.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:52,240
Okay. I mean, that can be kind of funny, right? However, just real quick, what gender is this

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,800
person? Is this one of those like women who are very clearly women just calling themselves

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,400
non-binary? Is that what this is? I don't know. Oh, it's a marriage.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,720
Oh, wait, wait. What kind of wedding dress is that?

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,560
Even he's like, what the fuck? He's got to sit down for a minute.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,720
I know it's supposed to be very traditional that the groom doesn't see the bride on the

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,920
wedding day, doesn't know what the dress looks like or anything. The surprise is a traditional

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,160
part of a wedding, I think. But I'm pretty sure in modern times, they don't do that anymore.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Isn't it normal for guys to have seen the wedding dress before the wedding actually starts

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,160
nowadays? I don't know. He looked legitimately surprised though. He's like, oh my God.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,800
It looked like a maid outfit than an actual wedding dress. Confusing strangers and NPCs. Okay.

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,080
The wild animals are coming tonight. There's no way you'll be able to fight.

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,640
Oh, why? They're vicious. They're hungry. They want to eat the whole country.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,800
What the fuck?

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Is that just like acting intentionally cringe and awkward just to get people's reaction,

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,600
even though it makes no fucking sense? Is that becoming a thing again? It was a thing in like

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,360
2008, 2009. I remember it very well. Is it becoming a thing again? I hope not. Jesus Christ.

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
I have no clue what she's saying. I have no clue what she's saying.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
I'm just going to mute her. I'm just going to mute her. I have no clue what she's saying, dude,

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,280
but like this is maybe Sargon and Akamek agent were right with the tomboy abs guys.

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,960
If this is the end result, if you stick your dick in this chick,

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,360
it will just come out flattened. We're at actual death by snooze new levels here.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,040
The kids just giving him shit. Are we trying to play the game?

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Like, I think he knows better than to actually confront the audience directly,

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
but you could tell he heard that when it was like, what the fuck?

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,040
You know, it's always kind of fun to see kids trolling and being little shits probably because

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,640
I was once a troll in little shit back in the day. Hi. Hi. My name is Tempest. I see

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,600
those pronouns. And if you don't want me to step on your toes. Yeah. Move your fucking feet.

38
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:56,880
What? Is that supposed to be a threat? Also, okay. That's a very feminine person. Yeah,

39
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,200
they're very old, right? But like it's still very feminine. What about them is they them?

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Forget about the, the Neo pronoun bullshit. Like that's just fucking ridiculous. But like,

41
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,200
what about this person is in any way masculine. This is just a punk girl. We didn't consider,

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,680
we didn't consider punk, a different gender back in the two thousands guys. In fact,

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,520
I'm calling it now. They took away your punk and your goth GFS by turning them into not GFS at all.

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,680
This is an actual Nazi March on. There's some hidden faces. They could be glowies,

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
or they could just be wanting to hide there. Who knows? Right.

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,720
Nope. Well, whatever they are, they're marching around.

47
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,720
You know what? I don't like them, but if we're going to be having, you know,

48
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,040
other political groups, March around in the streets with masks and intimidating people,

49
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,360
this, this is, this is the world that we've built now. It's fucking disgusting. But here we are.

50
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,680
Whoa. A lot of them don't though. A lot of them haven't though.

51
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,040
I want to stab all of you to death as many times as I can. I want to stab you in the throat and

52
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,520
twist it like I'm carving a fucking pumpkin. I want to shred you into tiny fucking pieces.

53
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,360
I want to tear your fucking bones. Oh my God, dude. I want to scoop your brains out with a

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,440
fucking spoon. I want to eat your fucking flesh. Holy shit. Okay. How much of that is

55
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,600
just edulardism? How much of that is like pure schizophrenia? I don't know. But like,

56
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
there are, I know, it's not all of them. Obviously, there are definitely some violent

57
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,800
transphobes out there. But there's a lot of people that let's say trans activists call transphobes

58
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
that are actually decent people that just don't agree with you on this issue. Also,

59
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,320
this just seems like impotent rage, you know, this person's not ever gonna be able to do any of this.

60
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,640
They would probably like go to like swing a punch, and they just break their fit their

61
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,520
fist on someone's jaw. Like there's, there's no actual strength behind this. It's just impotent

62
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,360
rage. What's your body count? Hey, Grandpa, whatever you think it is. Only three. Only three.

63
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,840
Only three. Okay, what are you thinking it is? What do you think I'm asking? How many people I

64
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:33,440
killed? Listen, you gotta never ask an Italian that question. Okay.

65
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,400
That's a, that's a pretty big self report. Okay, hold on. Let's turn the music off.

66
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,760
Um, hold on. What? Wait, wait, what? Putting lipstick on your teeth. Why?

67
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,040
Okay, let's just skip over the fact that this person's very clearly male and

68
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,280
very male presenting wearing lipstick. Forget about that part. Why? Why put it on your teeth?

69
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:08,720
What's the purpose of that? Like, what? Okay, fine. We get it. We get it. You're wearing,

70
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,920
you're wearing lipstick. You want those blowjobs to look real nice. We understand.

71
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,520
But why? Why the teeth? What the fuck is the point of the teeth? Why would you like,

72
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,040
it looks like you've just been punching the face. Why would you ever match your teeth to your

73
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,120
lipstick? All right, so cheers to tricking that fucking dumb ass nigga. You can't say that,

74
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:38,720
you're white. This is for all trans women in the world to get this suspected. What's going on?

75
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,400
What the fuck?

76
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,160
Are you just, this is a hotel room, right? You're just trashing a hotel room?

77
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
I mean, it's nice that you recorded yourself committing the crime.

78
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,080
What the fuck is going on here?

79
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,040
Is this just going to be like this person trashing the hotel room?

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh yeah, dude, just shove your foot in there when there's glass around. Good idea. This person's

81
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:51,520
a retard. Fuck. Okay. So I went and looked it up. Apparently this person went to a hotel room to

82
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,080
have sex with a guy. However, she didn't tell the guy that she was trans. And so he left because

83
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,720
he's like, I'm not interested in this. So he left. However, the hotel room was under his credit card.

84
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,440
So she got drunk with the alcohol that I guess he had brought and then decided to destroy the

85
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,080
hotel room because she was pissed that he wouldn't sleep with her. If you think guys take rejection

86
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,160
badly, it's another thing coming when you see some of these people. In fact, let me just play

87
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,560
the start of this video again real quick. All right, so cheers to tricking that fucking

88
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:34,080
dumb ass nigga. Cheers to tricking that dumb ass. Okay. So even she is framing this as if she

89
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,760
tricked him. I know that some people in the trans community think the word trap is transphobic

90
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,800
because it implies that trans women are trying to trap guys. But even she's saying it. I got scammed.

91
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,400
PlayStation five. That's a PS2 game though. That's not a PS5. That's like a

92
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,440
fan or a router or like an air exchangers and hold on. PS5 Spider-Man 2 box.

93
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,040
Inside of it is the Spider-Man 2 PS2 game and I'll pause it. Let's see. That looks like

94
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
a fan or a dehumidifier or something. You know what I mean? You go on Facebook marketplace,

95
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,200
you go on Craigslist or whatever and they're just like, hey, 20 bucks, PS5. Don't ever take that

96
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:31,120
deal. What the fuck? Okay, was that real? Like that could have been CG'd or something or like

97
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
AI'd, right? Like, I mean, I guess if you really want to look cool, you could do that. But like,

98
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,800
that's fucking stupid, dude. One wrong slip up and you're done. I got to watch that again. Hold on.

99
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,760
It doesn't look fake. He just hops up. Fuck, dude. A heart attack just watching it.

100
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,400
Okay, so in November, I decided I no longer wanted to be a responsible parent.

101
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,480
Okay. I was just tired of being responsible and caring for them. I felt like I was too young and

102
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,440
I wanted to go out there and experience life. This piece of shit. So it just didn't fit with

103
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,920
my new lifestyle. Yeah. And I didn't have anything to worry about because the other parent is a very

104
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,960
responsible parent. But now I'm here because now I'm in child support and to top it off,

105
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm really pissed off that I took care of them all the way up to November and I couldn't claim

106
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:28,560
them on my taxes because the other parent had already claimed them. Child support is

107
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,960
anti-feminist and anti-woman, guys. It's preventing her from living her best life.

108
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,160
What a terrible fucking piece of shit, human dude. You're an adult that comes with responsibilities.

109
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,440
That's how it is. Take care of your fucking kids. Hey. Hey. So we're having a real debate

110
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,600
right here. Okay. I am non-binary. I am a non-binary woman. Non-binary woman. Got it.

111
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:01,520
Kinda. I have a vagina owner. And my husband tells me consistently that he is a cis man

112
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,160
that likes vagina. Yeah, what's wrong with that? It's disgusting. And that's how he

113
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,880
identifies as a straight cis man. What's wrong with that? I find it offensive. What?

114
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,440
That my husband sees himself as straight. You're a woman. He's married to someone who is

115
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
non-binary. You just said you're a non-binary woman. I'm not a woman. You just said you're

116
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,400
a woman. So you're not straight. You're actually queer. And he won't acknowledge that. What the

117
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:38,720
fuck? He won't give me the acceptance of, yes, I understand we are a queer marriage and I am

118
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:48,480
inherently queer because I am attracted to all vagina owners, not just girls. What the fuck?

119
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:58,560
He likes non-binary spectrum women. Non-binary people, no gender, that have a vagina. He just

120
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,120
likes vagina. He just does not like penis. That makes him straight. So what he's saying is kind

121
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,080
of an insult to the LGBT community, honestly. Oh my God, dude. That he's not willing to accept

122
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:20,720
our marriage is queer because I'm non-binary and I'm pansexual. He would inherently be pansexual.

123
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh my God. Am I wrong? Yeah. Because he likes anyone, not based on genitalia,

124
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,280
but he likes them for who they are in the heart. He just said it's based on genitalia. Yeah,

125
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,040
vagina owners. That's based on genitalia. So what is he? And is this offensive? This can't

126
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,920
be fucking real. No, I think this one's actually real. Usually I ask, is this a troll? I think

127
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,400
this one's real. I know a guy, who's a straight guy, who is dating a non-binary woman. And this

128
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:55,120
non-binary woman is very tomboyish. And honestly, probably would just call themselves a tomboy had

129
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,080
it been 10 or 15 years ago, but now non-binary is in the lexicon. But this guy's like,

130
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:11,040
yeah, I'm straight. And even the person he's with says, yeah, it's ridiculous to call a relationship

131
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,880
anything other than a straight relationship. I have to make this video at some point of what

132
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:23,600
queer actually means because queer is just the political aspect of being LGBT. The relationship

133
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,560
described in this TikTok is just a straight relationship. It's penis and vagina, male and

134
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,840
female. It's just a straight relationship, but you have this political identification

135
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,480
overlaying on top of it. You have people who are frankly, just they're just straight

136
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,400
and they're just cis and they're calling themselves LGBT because they've adopted a certain

137
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,160
political point of view that allows them inclusivity without actually being gay or trans

138
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,480
or bi. It's wild dude. I got to talk about this at some point. Not today though, because TikTok

139
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,200
Tuesday is over. Thanks very much for being here guys. Like I said at the start, you're watching

140
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,520
this on release, I'm streaming, so come by and say hi and I'll be on WIC TV tonight. So I hope
