00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
Hello everyone, welcome to TikTok Tuesday. Before we get going, I want to announce two things just

00:04.560 --> 00:10.080
very quickly. If you're watching this on release, I'll be streaming. I'm doing a Euro-friendly

00:10.080 --> 00:15.920
gaming stream for once, which will be starting around 1pm my time, 6pm BritBonger time. And

00:15.920 --> 00:20.400
secondly, the reason I'm doing that is because I'm going on WIC-TV's channel tonight. I'm going

00:20.400 --> 00:24.720
to do another interview, I think with Brianna Wu again. There's always more things to talk about.

00:24.720 --> 00:29.440
It always feels good to occasionally dip my toes into the Twitch politics sphere. So after you've

00:29.440 --> 00:32.880
watched this video, please go and check those out. I really appreciate it. Let's get on with

00:32.880 --> 00:36.800
the TikToks though. What have you guys sent me this week? Oh wait, wait, there's music. Hold on.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.480
Okay. Decided I'm going to misgender my entire family on Thanksgiving so they know how it feels.

00:44.240 --> 00:52.240
Okay. I mean, that can be kind of funny, right? However, just real quick, what gender is this

00:52.240 --> 00:56.800
person? Is this one of those like women who are very clearly women just calling themselves

00:56.800 --> 01:02.400
non-binary? Is that what this is? I don't know. Oh, it's a marriage.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.720
Oh, wait, wait. What kind of wedding dress is that?

01:11.680 --> 01:18.560
Even he's like, what the fuck? He's got to sit down for a minute.

01:18.560 --> 01:28.720
I know it's supposed to be very traditional that the groom doesn't see the bride on the

01:28.720 --> 01:33.920
wedding day, doesn't know what the dress looks like or anything. The surprise is a traditional

01:33.920 --> 01:38.160
part of a wedding, I think. But I'm pretty sure in modern times, they don't do that anymore.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.400
Isn't it normal for guys to have seen the wedding dress before the wedding actually starts

01:44.400 --> 01:48.160
nowadays? I don't know. He looked legitimately surprised though. He's like, oh my God.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.800
It looked like a maid outfit than an actual wedding dress. Confusing strangers and NPCs. Okay.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.080
The wild animals are coming tonight. There's no way you'll be able to fight.

02:04.080 --> 02:10.640
Oh, why? They're vicious. They're hungry. They want to eat the whole country.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.800
What the fuck?

02:15.680 --> 02:21.680
Is that just like acting intentionally cringe and awkward just to get people's reaction,

02:21.680 --> 02:25.600
even though it makes no fucking sense? Is that becoming a thing again? It was a thing in like

02:25.600 --> 02:33.360
2008, 2009. I remember it very well. Is it becoming a thing again? I hope not. Jesus Christ.

02:33.360 --> 02:38.800
I have no clue what she's saying. I have no clue what she's saying.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.120
I'm just going to mute her. I'm just going to mute her. I have no clue what she's saying, dude,

02:43.120 --> 02:49.280
but like this is maybe Sargon and Akamek agent were right with the tomboy abs guys.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.960
If this is the end result, if you stick your dick in this chick,

02:52.960 --> 02:57.360
it will just come out flattened. We're at actual death by snooze new levels here.

03:03.360 --> 03:11.040
The kids just giving him shit. Are we trying to play the game?

03:20.880 --> 03:24.880
Like, I think he knows better than to actually confront the audience directly,

03:24.880 --> 03:27.840
but you could tell he heard that when it was like, what the fuck?

03:29.280 --> 03:33.040
You know, it's always kind of fun to see kids trolling and being little shits probably because

03:33.280 --> 03:38.640
I was once a troll in little shit back in the day. Hi. Hi. My name is Tempest. I see

03:38.640 --> 03:45.600
those pronouns. And if you don't want me to step on your toes. Yeah. Move your fucking feet.

03:47.200 --> 03:56.880
What? Is that supposed to be a threat? Also, okay. That's a very feminine person. Yeah,

03:56.880 --> 04:01.200
they're very old, right? But like it's still very feminine. What about them is they them?

04:01.200 --> 04:05.760
Forget about the, the Neo pronoun bullshit. Like that's just fucking ridiculous. But like,

04:05.760 --> 04:11.200
what about this person is in any way masculine. This is just a punk girl. We didn't consider,

04:11.200 --> 04:15.680
we didn't consider punk, a different gender back in the two thousands guys. In fact,

04:15.680 --> 04:21.520
I'm calling it now. They took away your punk and your goth GFS by turning them into not GFS at all.

04:24.240 --> 04:29.680
This is an actual Nazi March on. There's some hidden faces. They could be glowies,

04:29.680 --> 04:33.520
or they could just be wanting to hide there. Who knows? Right.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.720
Nope. Well, whatever they are, they're marching around.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.720
You know what? I don't like them, but if we're going to be having, you know,

04:54.720 --> 04:59.040
other political groups, March around in the streets with masks and intimidating people,

04:59.680 --> 05:03.360
this, this is, this is the world that we've built now. It's fucking disgusting. But here we are.

05:06.080 --> 05:13.680
Whoa. A lot of them don't though. A lot of them haven't though.

05:14.560 --> 05:21.040
I want to stab all of you to death as many times as I can. I want to stab you in the throat and

05:21.040 --> 05:27.520
twist it like I'm carving a fucking pumpkin. I want to shred you into tiny fucking pieces.

05:27.520 --> 05:33.360
I want to tear your fucking bones. Oh my God, dude. I want to scoop your brains out with a

05:33.360 --> 05:41.440
fucking spoon. I want to eat your fucking flesh. Holy shit. Okay. How much of that is

05:41.440 --> 05:45.600
just edulardism? How much of that is like pure schizophrenia? I don't know. But like,

05:45.600 --> 05:48.960
there are, I know, it's not all of them. Obviously, there are definitely some violent

05:48.960 --> 05:54.800
transphobes out there. But there's a lot of people that let's say trans activists call transphobes

05:54.800 --> 05:58.080
that are actually decent people that just don't agree with you on this issue. Also,

05:58.080 --> 06:02.320
this just seems like impotent rage, you know, this person's not ever gonna be able to do any of this.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.640
They would probably like go to like swing a punch, and they just break their fit their

06:06.640 --> 06:11.520
fist on someone's jaw. Like there's, there's no actual strength behind this. It's just impotent

06:11.520 --> 06:19.360
rage. What's your body count? Hey, Grandpa, whatever you think it is. Only three. Only three.

06:19.360 --> 06:25.840
Only three. Okay, what are you thinking it is? What do you think I'm asking? How many people I

06:25.840 --> 06:33.440
killed? Listen, you gotta never ask an Italian that question. Okay.

06:35.440 --> 06:42.400
That's a, that's a pretty big self report. Okay, hold on. Let's turn the music off.

06:42.400 --> 06:49.760
Um, hold on. What? Wait, wait, what? Putting lipstick on your teeth. Why?

06:50.960 --> 06:55.040
Okay, let's just skip over the fact that this person's very clearly male and

06:55.040 --> 06:59.280
very male presenting wearing lipstick. Forget about that part. Why? Why put it on your teeth?

07:00.320 --> 07:08.720
What's the purpose of that? Like, what? Okay, fine. We get it. We get it. You're wearing,

07:08.720 --> 07:11.920
you're wearing lipstick. You want those blowjobs to look real nice. We understand.

07:12.880 --> 07:17.520
But why? Why the teeth? What the fuck is the point of the teeth? Why would you like,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.040
it looks like you've just been punching the face. Why would you ever match your teeth to your

07:21.040 --> 07:27.120
lipstick? All right, so cheers to tricking that fucking dumb ass nigga. You can't say that,

07:27.120 --> 07:38.720
you're white. This is for all trans women in the world to get this suspected. What's going on?

07:39.680 --> 07:40.400
What the fuck?

07:49.280 --> 07:52.160
Are you just, this is a hotel room, right? You're just trashing a hotel room?

07:57.680 --> 08:00.560
I mean, it's nice that you recorded yourself committing the crime.

08:09.600 --> 08:14.080
What the fuck is going on here?

08:24.080 --> 08:27.040
Is this just going to be like this person trashing the hotel room?

08:30.000 --> 08:35.600
Oh yeah, dude, just shove your foot in there when there's glass around. Good idea. This person's

08:35.600 --> 08:51.520
a retard. Fuck. Okay. So I went and looked it up. Apparently this person went to a hotel room to

08:51.520 --> 08:58.080
have sex with a guy. However, she didn't tell the guy that she was trans. And so he left because

08:58.080 --> 09:02.720
he's like, I'm not interested in this. So he left. However, the hotel room was under his credit card.

09:02.720 --> 09:09.440
So she got drunk with the alcohol that I guess he had brought and then decided to destroy the

09:09.440 --> 09:14.080
hotel room because she was pissed that he wouldn't sleep with her. If you think guys take rejection

09:14.080 --> 09:18.160
badly, it's another thing coming when you see some of these people. In fact, let me just play

09:18.160 --> 09:24.560
the start of this video again real quick. All right, so cheers to tricking that fucking

09:24.560 --> 09:34.080
dumb ass nigga. Cheers to tricking that dumb ass. Okay. So even she is framing this as if she

09:34.080 --> 09:39.760
tricked him. I know that some people in the trans community think the word trap is transphobic

09:39.760 --> 09:46.800
because it implies that trans women are trying to trap guys. But even she's saying it. I got scammed.

09:47.040 --> 09:52.400
PlayStation five. That's a PS2 game though. That's not a PS5. That's like a

09:54.640 --> 09:59.440
fan or a router or like an air exchangers and hold on. PS5 Spider-Man 2 box.

10:00.800 --> 10:07.040
Inside of it is the Spider-Man 2 PS2 game and I'll pause it. Let's see. That looks like

10:08.240 --> 10:13.360
a fan or a dehumidifier or something. You know what I mean? You go on Facebook marketplace,

10:13.360 --> 10:19.200
you go on Craigslist or whatever and they're just like, hey, 20 bucks, PS5. Don't ever take that

10:19.200 --> 10:31.120
deal. What the fuck? Okay, was that real? Like that could have been CG'd or something or like

10:31.120 --> 10:35.120
AI'd, right? Like, I mean, I guess if you really want to look cool, you could do that. But like,

10:35.120 --> 10:40.800
that's fucking stupid, dude. One wrong slip up and you're done. I got to watch that again. Hold on.

10:41.760 --> 10:49.760
It doesn't look fake. He just hops up. Fuck, dude. A heart attack just watching it.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.400
Okay, so in November, I decided I no longer wanted to be a responsible parent.

10:55.840 --> 11:00.480
Okay. I was just tired of being responsible and caring for them. I felt like I was too young and

11:00.480 --> 11:05.440
I wanted to go out there and experience life. This piece of shit. So it just didn't fit with

11:05.440 --> 11:09.920
my new lifestyle. Yeah. And I didn't have anything to worry about because the other parent is a very

11:09.920 --> 11:14.960
responsible parent. But now I'm here because now I'm in child support and to top it off,

11:14.960 --> 11:18.800
I'm really pissed off that I took care of them all the way up to November and I couldn't claim

11:18.800 --> 11:28.560
them on my taxes because the other parent had already claimed them. Child support is

11:28.560 --> 11:32.960
anti-feminist and anti-woman, guys. It's preventing her from living her best life.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.160
What a terrible fucking piece of shit, human dude. You're an adult that comes with responsibilities.

11:38.160 --> 11:43.440
That's how it is. Take care of your fucking kids. Hey. Hey. So we're having a real debate

11:43.440 --> 11:51.600
right here. Okay. I am non-binary. I am a non-binary woman. Non-binary woman. Got it.

11:51.600 --> 12:01.520
Kinda. I have a vagina owner. And my husband tells me consistently that he is a cis man

12:02.400 --> 12:06.160
that likes vagina. Yeah, what's wrong with that? It's disgusting. And that's how he

12:06.160 --> 12:12.880
identifies as a straight cis man. What's wrong with that? I find it offensive. What?

12:12.880 --> 12:19.440
That my husband sees himself as straight. You're a woman. He's married to someone who is

12:19.440 --> 12:23.440
non-binary. You just said you're a non-binary woman. I'm not a woman. You just said you're

12:23.440 --> 12:30.400
a woman. So you're not straight. You're actually queer. And he won't acknowledge that. What the

12:30.400 --> 12:38.720
fuck? He won't give me the acceptance of, yes, I understand we are a queer marriage and I am

12:38.720 --> 12:48.480
inherently queer because I am attracted to all vagina owners, not just girls. What the fuck?

12:48.480 --> 12:58.560
He likes non-binary spectrum women. Non-binary people, no gender, that have a vagina. He just

12:58.560 --> 13:05.120
likes vagina. He just does not like penis. That makes him straight. So what he's saying is kind

13:05.120 --> 13:12.080
of an insult to the LGBT community, honestly. Oh my God, dude. That he's not willing to accept

13:12.080 --> 13:20.720
our marriage is queer because I'm non-binary and I'm pansexual. He would inherently be pansexual.

13:20.720 --> 13:26.000
Oh my God. Am I wrong? Yeah. Because he likes anyone, not based on genitalia,

13:26.720 --> 13:31.280
but he likes them for who they are in the heart. He just said it's based on genitalia. Yeah,

13:31.280 --> 13:35.040
vagina owners. That's based on genitalia. So what is he? And is this offensive? This can't

13:35.040 --> 13:41.920
be fucking real. No, I think this one's actually real. Usually I ask, is this a troll? I think

13:41.920 --> 13:48.400
this one's real. I know a guy, who's a straight guy, who is dating a non-binary woman. And this

13:48.400 --> 13:55.120
non-binary woman is very tomboyish. And honestly, probably would just call themselves a tomboy had

13:55.120 --> 14:02.080
it been 10 or 15 years ago, but now non-binary is in the lexicon. But this guy's like,

14:02.880 --> 14:11.040
yeah, I'm straight. And even the person he's with says, yeah, it's ridiculous to call a relationship

14:11.040 --> 14:14.880
anything other than a straight relationship. I have to make this video at some point of what

14:14.880 --> 14:23.600
queer actually means because queer is just the political aspect of being LGBT. The relationship

14:23.600 --> 14:28.560
described in this TikTok is just a straight relationship. It's penis and vagina, male and

14:28.560 --> 14:33.840
female. It's just a straight relationship, but you have this political identification

14:33.840 --> 14:38.480
overlaying on top of it. You have people who are frankly, just they're just straight

14:39.440 --> 14:44.400
and they're just cis and they're calling themselves LGBT because they've adopted a certain

14:44.400 --> 14:50.160
political point of view that allows them inclusivity without actually being gay or trans

14:50.160 --> 14:56.480
or bi. It's wild dude. I got to talk about this at some point. Not today though, because TikTok

14:56.480 --> 15:01.200
Tuesday is over. Thanks very much for being here guys. Like I said at the start, you're watching

15:01.200 --> 15:05.520
this on release, I'm streaming, so come by and say hi and I'll be on WIC TV tonight. So I hope

15:05.520 --> 15:10.240
you enjoy all that stuff. I'll see you there guys. Have a good one. I love you.
