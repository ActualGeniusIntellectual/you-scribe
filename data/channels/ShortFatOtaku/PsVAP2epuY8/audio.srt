00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
extra extra read all about it lindsey ellis is leaving the internet well she's leaving youtube

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,000
anyway yesterday she posted this on her patreon it cost two dollars to get in but uh i ain't paying

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,640
for it it's on archive.today walking away from omeleus omeleus well i don't know what this is

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
this is going to be a youtube video but i just don't have it in me to invite that kind of

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
scrutiny to be the last in the sex sad line of youtubers to get all weepy on camera and

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
crap about the how just can't do this anymore boo hoo hoo i wonder if she's expecting empathy for

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,880
herself even though she doesn't give it to other people i had planned to move video content to

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,320
nebulae but i realize now that doing that is just keeping wounds wide open my life ended nine months

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,120
ago what has been taking up bandwidth ever since then has been a ghost are you serious i know you

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
got cancelled nine months ago i did a video on it but this is histrionic lindsey chill out man

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,200
ain't that bad just just walk away from the screen turn the pc off go outside it'll be okay

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,680
it's almost funny how many people will insist that i have lost nothing you know because subscriber

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
count is the only metric for success and cancel culture doesn't exist one youtube channel checking

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,920
along on algorithmic inertia is not success it's just an engine driving on fumes you know i uh

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,160
wouldn't mind those subs i wouldn't mind that algorithmic inertia hey how about this just give

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,920
me your channel lindsey it'll be okay right you don't want it anymore many will say this is being

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
melodramatic that my life isn't over that there was absolutely nothing stopping me from brushing

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,640
myself off building back up goodwill and shutting up and playing the game and i tried that in a way

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,600
i suppose it's good that i did because i needed to learn the hard way this is never going to work

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,760
there's no unfucking this you can't find the energy if there's nothing left to convert to it

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,680
you can't be a better person if you're nothing but the hollow shell of one well lindsey you brought

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,200
this on yourself you weren't a good person progressive leftist politics do not create

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,800
good people you cultivated an audience of bitter failures who took it out on you because you were

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,840
not a bitter failure i'm not an idiot for being canceled by my audience even if i disagree with

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,440
my audience even if i even if i put out a video that no one likes and i just say you know what no

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,640
every single one of you is wrong even if i get into a knockdown drag out fight with my audience

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,880
i never fear being canceled because you attracted the terrible people with your own terribleness

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,800
i didn't do that sargon didn't do that even people like destiny didn't do that we all have audiences

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,560
who value free speech which means inherently valuing disagreement you rejected that and now

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,600
you are here 2021 has been the worst year of my life i'm traumatized by it to this day i still

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,800
have people scolding me about how i handled it i should have handled it differently i should

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,880
have controlled my stance if i had the capability to know what any of these people are even saying

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,160
to strangers on twitter while i was shitting blood for weeks on it what the fuck shitting blood are

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,680
you sure there's not something else happening here the worst thing about this whole year is

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
that i can't even admit this trauma because all the rhetorical devices people have already come

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
up with to dismiss it that centering my own pain is evidence of me not listening does it occur to

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,240
these people that you can listen and disagree with people's conclusions no it doesn't and you wanted

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,240
it that way you wanted to be able to shut down everybody who went against you everybody who

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,080
disagreed with your politics and now it's being used on you that i'm weaponizing my fragile white

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
womanhood or whatever to point out that having thousands upon thousands of people who you have

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
never met hate you and say whatever will get them the most up-dutes about it is in fact traumatizing

42
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,280
you wanted it this way you discarded real equality for equity and now that has been turned around on

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
you that people i used to know would fragrantly lie about me on twitter.com to the tune of

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
thousands of retweets and tens of thousands of likes i just had to sit there and take it again

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,240
you did the exact same thing to a lot of people you used to know my favorite are the people who

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,080
dismiss any potential harm i might have incurred as justified because i'm a wealthy white woman

47
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,560
i'm not wealthy um you're wealthier than most people let's be honest these people don't see how

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,040
similar these talking points are to the same boomer bootstrap parenting style that i thought

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,560
most of us agree was abusive you need to toughen up accept your punishment except that even if the

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,480
reaction was outsized you did something wrong because where there's smoke there's fire you

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,200
cultivated that attitude even the most repressive religions have a pathway to salvation your ethical

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,800
system is more immoral than like islams because at least with them if you repent you're welcomed

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,320
back into the brotherhood you spent years among a group of people who did not care one lick for

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,960
the virtue of forgiveness and now you are surprised that when you have to ask for forgiveness they're

55
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,680
not going to give it to you these same people always crow about believing victims telling

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,520
victims of public dogpiles that they do not deserve to claim their trauma let alone to process

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,600
it because they deserved it there is no such thing as cancer culture there is no incentive reward

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,000
structure in places like twitter to call people out there are no updoets faves follows retweets

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,920
for hotting a take on whomever is trending remember you didn't say this lindsey but you

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,120
absolutely love the person that did everything is sexist everything is racist everything is

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,800
homophobic and you have to point it all out and now you are being called out i don't even agree

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
with what anita said here but these are the rules that you live by and they are the rules that you

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,840
are now dying by one of the most common tools of exclusion is through mobbing which is rarely

64
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
talked about because unlike rape or murder it's not easy to pin it on a single person or scapegoat

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
mobbing is emotional abuse practiced by a group of people usually peers over a period of time

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
through methods such as gaslighting rumor mongering and ostracism it's most documented

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,520
in workplace or academic environments key points of capitalist tension it's capitalism it's done

68
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,480
this to you lindsey isn't it your own capitalist success has made the rabble who watch you decide

69
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,480
to overthrow the system but is thoroughly institutionalized into feminist queer and

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,960
radical spaces as well almost like it's not fucking capitalist one it has an unusually

71
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,480
strong power to damage the victim's relationship to society because it can't be written off as an

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,160
outlier as some singular monster it reveals a fundamental truth about people that makes

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600
it difficult to trust ever again people become like aliens like a pack of animals that can turn

74
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
on you as soon as some mysterious pheromone shift marks you for death you wanted collectivism and

75
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,480
now you have the justice of the mob to the insidious nature of emotional abuse how do you

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,160
fight ostracism and rumors they leave no bruises they just starve you every youtuber has had some

77
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,640
level of rumor spread about them all the time there's so much false shit about me online it's

78
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
beggar's belief but you know what i just keep making videos i don't look at it i don't care

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,280
i go offline we need to go offline i hang out with people irl when i need to like it's the internet

80
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,600
dude chill three mobbing typically occurs in places where the victim is trapped by some need

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,000
or obligation work school circles and friends twitter twitter is not a place of need or

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,600
obligation turn it off the isabel fall case is almost a textbook example of how online mobbing

83
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
harms people how the people who participate in these mobs never engage in any self-reflection

84
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,160
when some people read falls helicopter story and questioned the trans botafides of the author in

85
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,880
early 2020 twitter did what twitter does and ruined falls life death by a million cuts no

86
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,640
one single person even beginning to question whether they did anything wrong by jumping to

87
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,480
the worst possible faith and interpretation of both the text and the author one of isabel

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,440
falls detractors neon yang became the new scapegoat using some of the same tactics used

89
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,200
the prior year to attack fall i'm not going to touch on yang's original comments about fall or

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,560
the pushback to them but what was downright charming and its lack of self-awareness about

91
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,440
the whole thing was the way people used falls trauma to attack yang the way that they invoked

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,920
fall being checked into the hospital while yang said whatever about fall all the while having no

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,760
idea what was going on in yang's private life what's particularly galling is how many people

94
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,720
accused yang of sending a trans person to the hospital of ptsd while apparently being completely

95
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,640
oblivious to the fact they could very well be doing the same thing to yang a non-binary trans

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,560
person there was no lesson learned on the nature of mindless dogpiling just twitter doing what

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
twitter does and this is actually a very interesting part because it is describing how

98
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,280
the left eats its own you have isabel fall who wrote a story called helicopter story people

99
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,520
thought that was a reference to the attack helicopter meme so a bunch of trans people

100
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,960
dogpiled her and she ended up institutionalized for a short while one of the prominent dogpilers

101
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,800
was neon yang and later on for another event neon yang got dogpiled by the same people and one of

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,760
the things they attacked neon yang with was saying how audacious it was that neon yang

103
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,680
attacked isabelle fall during that previous event even though they also all attacked isabelle fall

104
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,240
in the same way and you get people like this on twitter who kind of prove lindsey ellis right

105
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,200
lindsey ellis a new york times best-selling author comparing herself to isabelle fall a

106
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,520
trans woman who was harassed to the point of near suicide for a short story she wrote and then going

107
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,320
on to defend the person who did the harassing is a truly an apt send-off there are so many other

108
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,160
examples she could have used for comparison maybe don't use a trans woman who didn't even get to

109
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,040
fully begin her career while ellis enjoys a career as a successful and well-loved author and video

110
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,200
essayist listen i thought the defense of neon yang in an essay about leaving youtube was weird

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,440
and even weirder when she implied that it was mostly cis straight men criticizing them when

112
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,400
in reality it was mostly other trans people so excuse me if i call that out point it all out this

113
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,560
person is doing the exact thing that lindsey ellis is criticizing the entire left for like

114
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,520
this passage doesn't even come to yang's defense it just draws parallels between the two but this

115
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,040
is the nature of the online left both the socialists and the progs and lindsey the

116
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,840
reason that you are so inundated with this is because these are the people you courted as your

117
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,760
audience i court edge lords i court people who are interested in humor i court people who can

118
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,000
laugh at everyone in a non-partisan way people who aren't strictly leftist or strictly rightist that's

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,080
why i'm not afraid of it but you chose this something else that was also inevitable i was

120
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,120
going to quit youtube i knew i couldn't do it forever that i was running out of steam that i

121
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,040
was sick of the increasing dehumanization inherent that i just didn't have anything to say about

122
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,120
movies anymore what happened to me in march and april hastened it this was always inevitable now

123
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,960
if you fall out of love with a platform or a project that's fine happens everybody i mean the

124
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,560
main reason i'm still going is because i love doing what i do i've reinvented this channel

125
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,320
several times but i've never seriously ever thought of quitting my initial plan was to leave

126
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,400
youtube for nebula but i realize now that this is only entrenching myself in a more intimate form of

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,400
harm rather than the broad buckshot kind that youtube invites i won't go into detail but i

128
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,960
can't do video content for them either i can't make content period i just can't do this anymore

129
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,480
there is no healing as long as there's attachment to the thing that makes you suffer and the thing

130
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
in this case is being in the public eye at all you go back and you watch really old lindsey ellis

131
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,400
videos we're talking like that guy with the glasses ear stuff when she was the nostalgia check

132
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,840
she is bright she is happy to be there she has interesting things to say even in old vlogs she's

133
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,200
very clearly like quite leftist but she seems like she would be a genuinely fun person to be

134
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,160
around and now she isn't she's exactly as she said she's been hollowed out but it wasn't by age

135
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,960
despite all of the jokes about her current looks i'm married wow me too um i'm flattered you know

136
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,360
and i and i get that you've been trying really really hard to get my attention you know for

137
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,920
obvious reasons but again i'm married uh i don't think it would really work out between us honestly

138
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,880
you're a little old for me but i find it really interesting how you wish to personalize this

139
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,800
because lindsey if we have to do this let's have a conversation about attractiveness shall we

140
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,480
because i don't know whether you recall but we've seen you from the side and i don't want

141
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,560
to be brutal about it but i'm not terribly impressed i happen to notice you've also had

142
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,000
an abortion and then made a movie about an abortion now i as a father of three and with

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,360
a very healthy and happy fat bouncing baby i'm not very attracted to the kind of woman who would

144
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,240
have bought her own child before she was born i think that's really gross but then i looked at

145
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:19,440
your wikipedia page it says you're 37 37 i'm 41 lindsey my wife is five years younger than you

146
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,200
and it wasn't even by her audience even though her audience is a big part of it

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,600
it was by her own politics broad spectrum leftist politics it's like heroin it feels really good

148
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,800
it's really pleasurable it's addictive but its corrupting influence does eventually destroy you

149
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,120
and you either drive away the good people who are around you or those people turn it just as

150
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,360
bad as you what i wanted was to quietly disappear but since this is a platform where people are

151
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,520
paying me to make content i feel like i have to make a statement if it were just me by myself

152
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,280
i would just sign off and say goodbye and that would be it but i have a team who depends on my

153
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,320
company for health insurance and including dependents i supply full benefits for eight

154
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,080
people and here in the us employer-based insurance is often the only feasible option

155
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,120
saying to everyone sorry about your children but they can't have insurance anymore because twitter

156
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,360
makes me sad just doesn't seem like a fair deal none of them incidentally know i'm posting this

157
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,520
hold on you're you're quitting you're running a company you got employees and this is how they

158
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,960
know this is how they learn that they're losing their jobs what the fuck the only thing i can do

159
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,800
for now is keep this page active with the loose promise that someday i'll figure out something to

160
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,360
in the future to make up for this while asking you please stop messaging me for apologizing for not

161
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,040
being able to subscribe anymore you don't owe me anything this patreon is like my own life and

162
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,200
career just running on fumes okay let me translate these past two these past two paragraphs for you

163
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,640
i have a business i have financial obligations to people who work for me i will be legally and

164
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,320
morally fucked if i renege on those obligations so even though i'm not producing anything i'm just

165
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,560
going to leave my patreon up knowing that a lot of people who currently monthly subscribe to me

166
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,360
they have probably forgotten that they're doing it and they're not entirely paying

167
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,240
attention anymore and i just want to keep that passive income rolling in this is exploitative

168
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,040
as fuck dude but all i know now is that being in the public eye at all is a losing game and

169
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,720
i regret all of it i regret every time i've ever stood up for anyone it always backfires

170
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,120
i regret every time i've pushed back and something unjust it was always just used to hurt me i regret

171
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
every time i've ever stood up for myself i never did it correctly i regret every time i ever showed

172
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,400
any vulnerability just my ammunition to be used against me later i regret every time i ever tried

173
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,000
to play the game with peers and colleagues they will drop you the second you aren't popular on

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
twitter anymore it's all hollow and brittle if there's one thing i've learned this year it is

175
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
how eminently expendable i am it's amazing because it's the complete opposite for me

176
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,640
i don't regret any time i've stood up for anybody i have said unpopular things and i have had people

177
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,720
get mad at me but it was the right thing to do because i believed in it i don't regret any time

178
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
i've pushed back against something unjust even if i lose and everything falls apart i can at least

179
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
sleep at night i don't regret any time i stood up for myself in fact i should have done it more

180
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,160
i don't regret any time i showed any vulnerability there were some people who poked fun at me for it

181
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
and that's fine that's what banter is all about and i don't regret any of the friends that i've

182
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,800
made in this space even the ones who have backstabbed me i'm happy to have at this point

183
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,080
several friend groups full of people who genuinely like me and i genuinely like them it might suck

184
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,200
that friendship wasn't real where you were lindsey but it's definitely real over here the good

185
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,280
progressive cis straight wealthy white men keep on trucking and coming out on top because deep down

186
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,280
they know that the systems they profess to stand against ultimately exist to benefit them

187
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,520
well i'm not a good progressive cis straight wealthy white man it turns out it's almost like

188
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,880
it's your side of politics that has the misogyny problem that has the sexism problem that has the

189
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,080
racism problem now don't get me wrong the uh the right definitely has problems that are akin to

190
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,760
those but the left is not immune it's the people who are unaligned it's the people who are in the

191
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,040
center it's the people who do not subscribe to the left-right dichotomy it's the individualists

192
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,760
we're the ones who don't have these problems and so there it is lindsey ellis has taken off guys

193
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,560
and to be honest people on the left right now are overwhelmingly proving her right in some respects

194
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,360
has lindsey ellis considered the possibility she's kind of a whack bitch defending a rich white woman

195
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,240
with a victim complex while calling pocs incredibly sensitive and making up some bullshit scenario

196
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
to explain the way the criticism is just beyond parody lindsey ellis being harassed sucks but

197
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,040
lindsey ellis was racist in her portrayal of indigenous people with the portrayal of the

198
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,160
kulat tribe in the twilight series it is not poc's responsibility to protect white people

199
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,880
when we call them out point it all out my empathy for lindsey ellis is severely limited because what

200
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,080
is happening to her not only did her audience do to other people and not only did she cultivate

201
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,080
that audience with that attitude but she has done it to people herself she did it to rose of dawn

202
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,880
she did it to tom scott she certainly helped do it to doug walker and everyone over at that guy

203
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,320
with the glasses and trust me those guys weren't perfect either but lindsey acted ridiculously in

204
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,600
that scenario and possibly most famously of all she helped do it to movie bob now movie bob

205
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,120
he he really fucking asked for it but still even in her apology video she doesn't really apologize

206
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,240
like one other person i owe an apology to is movie bob i told him on twitter to leave me alone because

207
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,120
he was acting like a creep by being over familiar and continually signaling to the world that were

208
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,560
friends and he he was acting like a creep and we're not friends but i would have never done

209
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,640
that if i had known that the diet nazis were going to turn that into a meme like i don't like a lot

210
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,920
of what he says on twitter either but please stop using my face to torture this man leave him alone

211
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,640
like listen to the arrogance coming out of this woman yes i know that the sun god king rays of

212
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,080
lindsey ellis will not shine down upon the lambs of movie bob but do not torment him in his darkness

213
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,200
just leave him to rot peasants jesus christ i don't know if lindsey ellis is actually going

214
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,320
anywhere or not who knows she pulls this stunt every six months she's deleted her twitter before

215
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
and like i'm done i'm done with all this shit and she comes back a couple days later she has

216
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,600
repeatedly self-destructed in a spectacular public fashion phil fish style so this could be her

217
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,720
trying to get more relevance but it also could be her legitimately leaving doesn't really matter

218
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,920
though because aside from her self-destructions lindsey ellis at this point seems to be kind of

219
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,280
irrelevant oh well the end of another old guard youtube channel happens all the time nowadays

220
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,040
goodbye and good luck nostalgic here's some advice for your next adventure watch who you get in bed

221
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:24,240
with and over the last few years i have had so many of my colleagues all of them women people

222
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,760
of color trans people queer people or some combination of the above voice to me the constant

223
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,800
anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will get them on the bad

224
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,960
side of their own communities i didn't start getting noticeable harassment from the purity

225
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,440
tester brigade until i stood up for a trans woman on twitter and that backlash did not

226
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
come from the alt-right or even the diet nazis but our own community our side
