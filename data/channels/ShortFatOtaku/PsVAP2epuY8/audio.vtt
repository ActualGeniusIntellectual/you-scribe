00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
extra extra read all about it lindsey ellis is leaving the internet well she's leaving youtube

00:10.800 --> 00:16.000
anyway yesterday she posted this on her patreon it cost two dollars to get in but uh i ain't paying

00:16.000 --> 00:22.640
for it it's on archive.today walking away from omeleus omeleus well i don't know what this is

00:22.640 --> 00:25.920
this is going to be a youtube video but i just don't have it in me to invite that kind of

00:25.920 --> 00:30.320
scrutiny to be the last in the sex sad line of youtubers to get all weepy on camera and

00:30.320 --> 00:34.640
crap about the how just can't do this anymore boo hoo hoo i wonder if she's expecting empathy for

00:34.640 --> 00:38.880
herself even though she doesn't give it to other people i had planned to move video content to

00:38.880 --> 00:44.320
nebulae but i realize now that doing that is just keeping wounds wide open my life ended nine months

00:44.320 --> 00:49.120
ago what has been taking up bandwidth ever since then has been a ghost are you serious i know you

00:49.120 --> 00:54.160
got cancelled nine months ago i did a video on it but this is histrionic lindsey chill out man

00:54.160 --> 00:59.200
ain't that bad just just walk away from the screen turn the pc off go outside it'll be okay

00:59.200 --> 01:03.680
it's almost funny how many people will insist that i have lost nothing you know because subscriber

01:03.680 --> 01:08.080
count is the only metric for success and cancel culture doesn't exist one youtube channel checking

01:08.080 --> 01:13.920
along on algorithmic inertia is not success it's just an engine driving on fumes you know i uh

01:13.920 --> 01:18.160
wouldn't mind those subs i wouldn't mind that algorithmic inertia hey how about this just give

01:18.160 --> 01:21.920
me your channel lindsey it'll be okay right you don't want it anymore many will say this is being

01:21.920 --> 01:26.240
melodramatic that my life isn't over that there was absolutely nothing stopping me from brushing

01:26.240 --> 01:30.640
myself off building back up goodwill and shutting up and playing the game and i tried that in a way

01:30.640 --> 01:33.600
i suppose it's good that i did because i needed to learn the hard way this is never going to work

01:33.600 --> 01:37.760
there's no unfucking this you can't find the energy if there's nothing left to convert to it

01:37.760 --> 01:41.680
you can't be a better person if you're nothing but the hollow shell of one well lindsey you brought

01:41.680 --> 01:47.200
this on yourself you weren't a good person progressive leftist politics do not create

01:47.200 --> 01:52.800
good people you cultivated an audience of bitter failures who took it out on you because you were

01:52.800 --> 01:57.840
not a bitter failure i'm not an idiot for being canceled by my audience even if i disagree with

01:57.840 --> 02:01.440
my audience even if i even if i put out a video that no one likes and i just say you know what no

02:01.440 --> 02:06.640
every single one of you is wrong even if i get into a knockdown drag out fight with my audience

02:06.640 --> 02:12.880
i never fear being canceled because you attracted the terrible people with your own terribleness

02:12.880 --> 02:18.800
i didn't do that sargon didn't do that even people like destiny didn't do that we all have audiences

02:18.800 --> 02:24.560
who value free speech which means inherently valuing disagreement you rejected that and now

02:24.560 --> 02:29.600
you are here 2021 has been the worst year of my life i'm traumatized by it to this day i still

02:29.600 --> 02:32.800
have people scolding me about how i handled it i should have handled it differently i should

02:32.800 --> 02:36.880
have controlled my stance if i had the capability to know what any of these people are even saying

02:36.880 --> 02:42.160
to strangers on twitter while i was shitting blood for weeks on it what the fuck shitting blood are

02:42.160 --> 02:45.680
you sure there's not something else happening here the worst thing about this whole year is

02:45.680 --> 02:49.200
that i can't even admit this trauma because all the rhetorical devices people have already come

02:49.200 --> 02:53.440
up with to dismiss it that centering my own pain is evidence of me not listening does it occur to

02:53.440 --> 02:58.240
these people that you can listen and disagree with people's conclusions no it doesn't and you wanted

02:58.240 --> 03:02.240
it that way you wanted to be able to shut down everybody who went against you everybody who

03:02.240 --> 03:06.080
disagreed with your politics and now it's being used on you that i'm weaponizing my fragile white

03:06.080 --> 03:09.680
womanhood or whatever to point out that having thousands upon thousands of people who you have

03:09.680 --> 03:13.920
never met hate you and say whatever will get them the most up-dutes about it is in fact traumatizing

03:13.920 --> 03:19.280
you wanted it this way you discarded real equality for equity and now that has been turned around on

03:19.280 --> 03:23.760
you that people i used to know would fragrantly lie about me on twitter.com to the tune of

03:23.760 --> 03:27.840
thousands of retweets and tens of thousands of likes i just had to sit there and take it again

03:27.840 --> 03:32.240
you did the exact same thing to a lot of people you used to know my favorite are the people who

03:32.240 --> 03:36.080
dismiss any potential harm i might have incurred as justified because i'm a wealthy white woman

03:36.080 --> 03:40.560
i'm not wealthy um you're wealthier than most people let's be honest these people don't see how

03:40.560 --> 03:45.040
similar these talking points are to the same boomer bootstrap parenting style that i thought

03:45.040 --> 03:48.560
most of us agree was abusive you need to toughen up accept your punishment except that even if the

03:48.560 --> 03:52.480
reaction was outsized you did something wrong because where there's smoke there's fire you

03:52.480 --> 03:59.200
cultivated that attitude even the most repressive religions have a pathway to salvation your ethical

03:59.200 --> 04:04.800
system is more immoral than like islams because at least with them if you repent you're welcomed

04:04.800 --> 04:10.320
back into the brotherhood you spent years among a group of people who did not care one lick for

04:10.320 --> 04:14.960
the virtue of forgiveness and now you are surprised that when you have to ask for forgiveness they're

04:14.960 --> 04:19.680
not going to give it to you these same people always crow about believing victims telling

04:19.680 --> 04:23.520
victims of public dogpiles that they do not deserve to claim their trauma let alone to process

04:23.520 --> 04:27.600
it because they deserved it there is no such thing as cancer culture there is no incentive reward

04:27.600 --> 04:32.000
structure in places like twitter to call people out there are no updoets faves follows retweets

04:32.000 --> 04:35.920
for hotting a take on whomever is trending remember you didn't say this lindsey but you

04:35.920 --> 04:41.120
absolutely love the person that did everything is sexist everything is racist everything is

04:41.120 --> 04:46.800
homophobic and you have to point it all out and now you are being called out i don't even agree

04:46.800 --> 04:51.120
with what anita said here but these are the rules that you live by and they are the rules that you

04:51.120 --> 04:55.840
are now dying by one of the most common tools of exclusion is through mobbing which is rarely

04:55.840 --> 05:00.000
talked about because unlike rape or murder it's not easy to pin it on a single person or scapegoat

05:00.000 --> 05:04.160
mobbing is emotional abuse practiced by a group of people usually peers over a period of time

05:04.160 --> 05:08.320
through methods such as gaslighting rumor mongering and ostracism it's most documented

05:08.320 --> 05:13.520
in workplace or academic environments key points of capitalist tension it's capitalism it's done

05:13.520 --> 05:18.480
this to you lindsey isn't it your own capitalist success has made the rabble who watch you decide

05:18.480 --> 05:22.480
to overthrow the system but is thoroughly institutionalized into feminist queer and

05:22.480 --> 05:26.960
radical spaces as well almost like it's not fucking capitalist one it has an unusually

05:26.960 --> 05:30.480
strong power to damage the victim's relationship to society because it can't be written off as an

05:30.480 --> 05:34.160
outlier as some singular monster it reveals a fundamental truth about people that makes

05:34.160 --> 05:37.600
it difficult to trust ever again people become like aliens like a pack of animals that can turn

05:37.600 --> 05:41.840
on you as soon as some mysterious pheromone shift marks you for death you wanted collectivism and

05:41.840 --> 05:46.480
now you have the justice of the mob to the insidious nature of emotional abuse how do you

05:46.480 --> 05:52.160
fight ostracism and rumors they leave no bruises they just starve you every youtuber has had some

05:52.160 --> 05:56.640
level of rumor spread about them all the time there's so much false shit about me online it's

05:56.880 --> 06:00.800
beggar's belief but you know what i just keep making videos i don't look at it i don't care

06:00.800 --> 06:05.280
i go offline we need to go offline i hang out with people irl when i need to like it's the internet

06:05.280 --> 06:09.600
dude chill three mobbing typically occurs in places where the victim is trapped by some need

06:09.600 --> 06:16.000
or obligation work school circles and friends twitter twitter is not a place of need or

06:16.000 --> 06:21.600
obligation turn it off the isabel fall case is almost a textbook example of how online mobbing

06:21.600 --> 06:25.600
harms people how the people who participate in these mobs never engage in any self-reflection

06:25.600 --> 06:30.160
when some people read falls helicopter story and questioned the trans botafides of the author in

06:30.160 --> 06:34.880
early 2020 twitter did what twitter does and ruined falls life death by a million cuts no

06:34.880 --> 06:38.640
one single person even beginning to question whether they did anything wrong by jumping to

06:38.640 --> 06:42.480
the worst possible faith and interpretation of both the text and the author one of isabel

06:42.480 --> 06:47.440
falls detractors neon yang became the new scapegoat using some of the same tactics used

06:47.440 --> 06:51.200
the prior year to attack fall i'm not going to touch on yang's original comments about fall or

06:51.200 --> 06:54.560
the pushback to them but what was downright charming and its lack of self-awareness about

06:54.560 --> 06:59.440
the whole thing was the way people used falls trauma to attack yang the way that they invoked

06:59.440 --> 07:03.920
fall being checked into the hospital while yang said whatever about fall all the while having no

07:03.920 --> 07:07.760
idea what was going on in yang's private life what's particularly galling is how many people

07:07.760 --> 07:12.720
accused yang of sending a trans person to the hospital of ptsd while apparently being completely

07:12.720 --> 07:16.640
oblivious to the fact they could very well be doing the same thing to yang a non-binary trans

07:16.640 --> 07:20.560
person there was no lesson learned on the nature of mindless dogpiling just twitter doing what

07:20.560 --> 07:24.800
twitter does and this is actually a very interesting part because it is describing how

07:24.800 --> 07:29.280
the left eats its own you have isabel fall who wrote a story called helicopter story people

07:29.280 --> 07:33.520
thought that was a reference to the attack helicopter meme so a bunch of trans people

07:33.520 --> 07:38.960
dogpiled her and she ended up institutionalized for a short while one of the prominent dogpilers

07:38.960 --> 07:44.800
was neon yang and later on for another event neon yang got dogpiled by the same people and one of

07:44.800 --> 07:49.760
the things they attacked neon yang with was saying how audacious it was that neon yang

07:49.760 --> 07:55.680
attacked isabelle fall during that previous event even though they also all attacked isabelle fall

07:55.680 --> 08:00.240
in the same way and you get people like this on twitter who kind of prove lindsey ellis right

08:00.240 --> 08:05.200
lindsey ellis a new york times best-selling author comparing herself to isabelle fall a

08:05.200 --> 08:09.520
trans woman who was harassed to the point of near suicide for a short story she wrote and then going

08:09.520 --> 08:14.320
on to defend the person who did the harassing is a truly an apt send-off there are so many other

08:14.320 --> 08:18.160
examples she could have used for comparison maybe don't use a trans woman who didn't even get to

08:18.160 --> 08:23.040
fully begin her career while ellis enjoys a career as a successful and well-loved author and video

08:23.040 --> 08:27.200
essayist listen i thought the defense of neon yang in an essay about leaving youtube was weird

08:27.200 --> 08:31.440
and even weirder when she implied that it was mostly cis straight men criticizing them when

08:31.440 --> 08:36.400
in reality it was mostly other trans people so excuse me if i call that out point it all out this

08:36.400 --> 08:42.560
person is doing the exact thing that lindsey ellis is criticizing the entire left for like

08:42.560 --> 08:47.520
this passage doesn't even come to yang's defense it just draws parallels between the two but this

08:47.520 --> 08:53.040
is the nature of the online left both the socialists and the progs and lindsey the

08:53.040 --> 08:57.840
reason that you are so inundated with this is because these are the people you courted as your

08:57.840 --> 09:01.760
audience i court edge lords i court people who are interested in humor i court people who can

09:01.760 --> 09:06.000
laugh at everyone in a non-partisan way people who aren't strictly leftist or strictly rightist that's

09:06.000 --> 09:10.080
why i'm not afraid of it but you chose this something else that was also inevitable i was

09:10.080 --> 09:13.120
going to quit youtube i knew i couldn't do it forever that i was running out of steam that i

09:13.120 --> 09:17.040
was sick of the increasing dehumanization inherent that i just didn't have anything to say about

09:17.040 --> 09:21.120
movies anymore what happened to me in march and april hastened it this was always inevitable now

09:21.120 --> 09:24.960
if you fall out of love with a platform or a project that's fine happens everybody i mean the

09:24.960 --> 09:28.560
main reason i'm still going is because i love doing what i do i've reinvented this channel

09:28.560 --> 09:32.320
several times but i've never seriously ever thought of quitting my initial plan was to leave

09:32.320 --> 09:36.400
youtube for nebula but i realize now that this is only entrenching myself in a more intimate form of

09:36.400 --> 09:40.400
harm rather than the broad buckshot kind that youtube invites i won't go into detail but i

09:40.400 --> 09:44.960
can't do video content for them either i can't make content period i just can't do this anymore

09:44.960 --> 09:48.480
there is no healing as long as there's attachment to the thing that makes you suffer and the thing

09:48.480 --> 09:52.560
in this case is being in the public eye at all you go back and you watch really old lindsey ellis

09:52.560 --> 09:56.400
videos we're talking like that guy with the glasses ear stuff when she was the nostalgia check

09:56.400 --> 10:01.840
she is bright she is happy to be there she has interesting things to say even in old vlogs she's

10:01.840 --> 10:07.200
very clearly like quite leftist but she seems like she would be a genuinely fun person to be

10:07.200 --> 10:12.160
around and now she isn't she's exactly as she said she's been hollowed out but it wasn't by age

10:12.160 --> 10:18.960
despite all of the jokes about her current looks i'm married wow me too um i'm flattered you know

10:18.960 --> 10:23.360
and i and i get that you've been trying really really hard to get my attention you know for

10:23.360 --> 10:29.920
obvious reasons but again i'm married uh i don't think it would really work out between us honestly

10:29.920 --> 10:34.880
you're a little old for me but i find it really interesting how you wish to personalize this

10:34.880 --> 10:42.800
because lindsey if we have to do this let's have a conversation about attractiveness shall we

10:42.800 --> 10:48.480
because i don't know whether you recall but we've seen you from the side and i don't want

10:48.480 --> 10:54.560
to be brutal about it but i'm not terribly impressed i happen to notice you've also had

10:54.560 --> 11:00.000
an abortion and then made a movie about an abortion now i as a father of three and with

11:00.000 --> 11:05.360
a very healthy and happy fat bouncing baby i'm not very attracted to the kind of woman who would

11:05.360 --> 11:10.240
have bought her own child before she was born i think that's really gross but then i looked at

11:10.240 --> 11:19.440
your wikipedia page it says you're 37 37 i'm 41 lindsey my wife is five years younger than you

11:19.440 --> 11:23.200
and it wasn't even by her audience even though her audience is a big part of it

11:23.200 --> 11:29.600
it was by her own politics broad spectrum leftist politics it's like heroin it feels really good

11:29.600 --> 11:34.800
it's really pleasurable it's addictive but its corrupting influence does eventually destroy you

11:34.800 --> 11:39.120
and you either drive away the good people who are around you or those people turn it just as

11:39.120 --> 11:43.360
bad as you what i wanted was to quietly disappear but since this is a platform where people are

11:43.360 --> 11:47.520
paying me to make content i feel like i have to make a statement if it were just me by myself

11:47.520 --> 11:51.280
i would just sign off and say goodbye and that would be it but i have a team who depends on my

11:51.280 --> 11:54.320
company for health insurance and including dependents i supply full benefits for eight

11:54.320 --> 11:58.080
people and here in the us employer-based insurance is often the only feasible option

11:58.080 --> 12:01.120
saying to everyone sorry about your children but they can't have insurance anymore because twitter

12:01.120 --> 12:05.360
makes me sad just doesn't seem like a fair deal none of them incidentally know i'm posting this

12:05.360 --> 12:11.520
hold on you're you're quitting you're running a company you got employees and this is how they

12:11.520 --> 12:16.960
know this is how they learn that they're losing their jobs what the fuck the only thing i can do

12:16.960 --> 12:20.800
for now is keep this page active with the loose promise that someday i'll figure out something to

12:20.880 --> 12:25.360
in the future to make up for this while asking you please stop messaging me for apologizing for not

12:25.360 --> 12:29.040
being able to subscribe anymore you don't owe me anything this patreon is like my own life and

12:29.040 --> 12:33.200
career just running on fumes okay let me translate these past two these past two paragraphs for you

12:33.200 --> 12:38.640
i have a business i have financial obligations to people who work for me i will be legally and

12:38.640 --> 12:44.320
morally fucked if i renege on those obligations so even though i'm not producing anything i'm just

12:44.320 --> 12:48.560
going to leave my patreon up knowing that a lot of people who currently monthly subscribe to me

12:48.560 --> 12:51.360
they have probably forgotten that they're doing it and they're not entirely paying

12:51.360 --> 12:56.240
attention anymore and i just want to keep that passive income rolling in this is exploitative

12:56.240 --> 13:01.040
as fuck dude but all i know now is that being in the public eye at all is a losing game and

13:01.040 --> 13:04.720
i regret all of it i regret every time i've ever stood up for anyone it always backfires

13:04.720 --> 13:09.120
i regret every time i've pushed back and something unjust it was always just used to hurt me i regret

13:09.120 --> 13:12.480
every time i've ever stood up for myself i never did it correctly i regret every time i ever showed

13:12.480 --> 13:16.400
any vulnerability just my ammunition to be used against me later i regret every time i ever tried

13:16.400 --> 13:20.000
to play the game with peers and colleagues they will drop you the second you aren't popular on

13:20.000 --> 13:24.320
twitter anymore it's all hollow and brittle if there's one thing i've learned this year it is

13:24.320 --> 13:28.320
how eminently expendable i am it's amazing because it's the complete opposite for me

13:28.320 --> 13:32.640
i don't regret any time i've stood up for anybody i have said unpopular things and i have had people

13:32.640 --> 13:36.720
get mad at me but it was the right thing to do because i believed in it i don't regret any time

13:36.720 --> 13:41.040
i've pushed back against something unjust even if i lose and everything falls apart i can at least

13:41.040 --> 13:45.360
sleep at night i don't regret any time i stood up for myself in fact i should have done it more

13:45.360 --> 13:50.160
i don't regret any time i showed any vulnerability there were some people who poked fun at me for it

13:50.160 --> 13:54.000
and that's fine that's what banter is all about and i don't regret any of the friends that i've

13:54.000 --> 13:58.800
made in this space even the ones who have backstabbed me i'm happy to have at this point

13:58.800 --> 14:04.080
several friend groups full of people who genuinely like me and i genuinely like them it might suck

14:04.080 --> 14:09.200
that friendship wasn't real where you were lindsey but it's definitely real over here the good

14:09.200 --> 14:15.280
progressive cis straight wealthy white men keep on trucking and coming out on top because deep down

14:15.280 --> 14:19.280
they know that the systems they profess to stand against ultimately exist to benefit them

14:19.280 --> 14:25.520
well i'm not a good progressive cis straight wealthy white man it turns out it's almost like

14:25.520 --> 14:30.880
it's your side of politics that has the misogyny problem that has the sexism problem that has the

14:30.880 --> 14:36.080
racism problem now don't get me wrong the uh the right definitely has problems that are akin to

14:36.080 --> 14:39.760
those but the left is not immune it's the people who are unaligned it's the people who are in the

14:39.760 --> 14:45.040
center it's the people who do not subscribe to the left-right dichotomy it's the individualists

14:45.040 --> 14:49.760
we're the ones who don't have these problems and so there it is lindsey ellis has taken off guys

14:49.760 --> 14:54.560
and to be honest people on the left right now are overwhelmingly proving her right in some respects

14:54.560 --> 14:59.360
has lindsey ellis considered the possibility she's kind of a whack bitch defending a rich white woman

14:59.360 --> 15:04.240
with a victim complex while calling pocs incredibly sensitive and making up some bullshit scenario

15:04.240 --> 15:08.800
to explain the way the criticism is just beyond parody lindsey ellis being harassed sucks but

15:08.800 --> 15:13.040
lindsey ellis was racist in her portrayal of indigenous people with the portrayal of the

15:13.040 --> 15:18.160
kulat tribe in the twilight series it is not poc's responsibility to protect white people

15:18.160 --> 15:24.880
when we call them out point it all out my empathy for lindsey ellis is severely limited because what

15:24.880 --> 15:30.080
is happening to her not only did her audience do to other people and not only did she cultivate

15:30.080 --> 15:36.080
that audience with that attitude but she has done it to people herself she did it to rose of dawn

15:36.080 --> 15:40.880
she did it to tom scott she certainly helped do it to doug walker and everyone over at that guy

15:40.880 --> 15:46.320
with the glasses and trust me those guys weren't perfect either but lindsey acted ridiculously in

15:46.320 --> 15:51.600
that scenario and possibly most famously of all she helped do it to movie bob now movie bob

15:52.560 --> 15:59.120
he he really fucking asked for it but still even in her apology video she doesn't really apologize

15:59.120 --> 16:04.240
like one other person i owe an apology to is movie bob i told him on twitter to leave me alone because

16:04.240 --> 16:09.120
he was acting like a creep by being over familiar and continually signaling to the world that were

16:09.120 --> 16:14.560
friends and he he was acting like a creep and we're not friends but i would have never done

16:14.560 --> 16:18.640
that if i had known that the diet nazis were going to turn that into a meme like i don't like a lot

16:18.640 --> 16:23.920
of what he says on twitter either but please stop using my face to torture this man leave him alone

16:23.920 --> 16:30.640
like listen to the arrogance coming out of this woman yes i know that the sun god king rays of

16:30.640 --> 16:36.080
lindsey ellis will not shine down upon the lambs of movie bob but do not torment him in his darkness

16:36.080 --> 16:41.200
just leave him to rot peasants jesus christ i don't know if lindsey ellis is actually going

16:41.200 --> 16:46.320
anywhere or not who knows she pulls this stunt every six months she's deleted her twitter before

16:46.320 --> 16:49.600
and like i'm done i'm done with all this shit and she comes back a couple days later she has

16:49.600 --> 16:55.600
repeatedly self-destructed in a spectacular public fashion phil fish style so this could be her

16:55.600 --> 16:58.720
trying to get more relevance but it also could be her legitimately leaving doesn't really matter

16:58.720 --> 17:03.920
though because aside from her self-destructions lindsey ellis at this point seems to be kind of

17:03.920 --> 17:09.280
irrelevant oh well the end of another old guard youtube channel happens all the time nowadays

17:09.280 --> 17:15.040
goodbye and good luck nostalgic here's some advice for your next adventure watch who you get in bed

17:15.040 --> 17:24.240
with and over the last few years i have had so many of my colleagues all of them women people

17:24.240 --> 17:29.760
of color trans people queer people or some combination of the above voice to me the constant

17:29.760 --> 17:34.800
anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will get them on the bad

17:34.800 --> 17:38.960
side of their own communities i didn't start getting noticeable harassment from the purity

17:38.960 --> 17:43.440
tester brigade until i stood up for a trans woman on twitter and that backlash did not

17:43.440 --> 17:48.880
come from the alt-right or even the diet nazis but our own community our side
