0	10800	extra extra read all about it lindsey ellis is leaving the internet well she's leaving youtube
10800	16000	anyway yesterday she posted this on her patreon it cost two dollars to get in but uh i ain't paying
16000	22640	for it it's on archive.today walking away from omeleus omeleus well i don't know what this is
22640	25920	this is going to be a youtube video but i just don't have it in me to invite that kind of
25920	30320	scrutiny to be the last in the sex sad line of youtubers to get all weepy on camera and
30320	34640	crap about the how just can't do this anymore boo hoo hoo i wonder if she's expecting empathy for
34640	38880	herself even though she doesn't give it to other people i had planned to move video content to
38880	44320	nebulae but i realize now that doing that is just keeping wounds wide open my life ended nine months
44320	49120	ago what has been taking up bandwidth ever since then has been a ghost are you serious i know you
49120	54160	got cancelled nine months ago i did a video on it but this is histrionic lindsey chill out man
54160	59200	ain't that bad just just walk away from the screen turn the pc off go outside it'll be okay
59200	63680	it's almost funny how many people will insist that i have lost nothing you know because subscriber
63680	68080	count is the only metric for success and cancel culture doesn't exist one youtube channel checking
68080	73920	along on algorithmic inertia is not success it's just an engine driving on fumes you know i uh
73920	78160	wouldn't mind those subs i wouldn't mind that algorithmic inertia hey how about this just give
78160	81920	me your channel lindsey it'll be okay right you don't want it anymore many will say this is being
81920	86240	melodramatic that my life isn't over that there was absolutely nothing stopping me from brushing
86240	90640	myself off building back up goodwill and shutting up and playing the game and i tried that in a way
90640	93600	i suppose it's good that i did because i needed to learn the hard way this is never going to work
93600	97760	there's no unfucking this you can't find the energy if there's nothing left to convert to it
97760	101680	you can't be a better person if you're nothing but the hollow shell of one well lindsey you brought
101680	107200	this on yourself you weren't a good person progressive leftist politics do not create
107200	112800	good people you cultivated an audience of bitter failures who took it out on you because you were
112800	117840	not a bitter failure i'm not an idiot for being canceled by my audience even if i disagree with
117840	121440	my audience even if i even if i put out a video that no one likes and i just say you know what no
121440	126640	every single one of you is wrong even if i get into a knockdown drag out fight with my audience
126640	132880	i never fear being canceled because you attracted the terrible people with your own terribleness
132880	138800	i didn't do that sargon didn't do that even people like destiny didn't do that we all have audiences
138800	144560	who value free speech which means inherently valuing disagreement you rejected that and now
144560	149600	you are here 2021 has been the worst year of my life i'm traumatized by it to this day i still
149600	152800	have people scolding me about how i handled it i should have handled it differently i should
152800	156880	have controlled my stance if i had the capability to know what any of these people are even saying
156880	162160	to strangers on twitter while i was shitting blood for weeks on it what the fuck shitting blood are
162160	165680	you sure there's not something else happening here the worst thing about this whole year is
165680	169200	that i can't even admit this trauma because all the rhetorical devices people have already come
169200	173440	up with to dismiss it that centering my own pain is evidence of me not listening does it occur to
173440	178240	these people that you can listen and disagree with people's conclusions no it doesn't and you wanted
178240	182240	it that way you wanted to be able to shut down everybody who went against you everybody who
182240	186080	disagreed with your politics and now it's being used on you that i'm weaponizing my fragile white
186080	189680	womanhood or whatever to point out that having thousands upon thousands of people who you have
189680	193920	never met hate you and say whatever will get them the most up-dutes about it is in fact traumatizing
193920	199280	you wanted it this way you discarded real equality for equity and now that has been turned around on
199280	203760	you that people i used to know would fragrantly lie about me on twitter.com to the tune of
203760	207840	thousands of retweets and tens of thousands of likes i just had to sit there and take it again
207840	212240	you did the exact same thing to a lot of people you used to know my favorite are the people who
212240	216080	dismiss any potential harm i might have incurred as justified because i'm a wealthy white woman
216080	220560	i'm not wealthy um you're wealthier than most people let's be honest these people don't see how
220560	225040	similar these talking points are to the same boomer bootstrap parenting style that i thought
225040	228560	most of us agree was abusive you need to toughen up accept your punishment except that even if the
228560	232480	reaction was outsized you did something wrong because where there's smoke there's fire you
232480	239200	cultivated that attitude even the most repressive religions have a pathway to salvation your ethical
239200	244800	system is more immoral than like islams because at least with them if you repent you're welcomed
244800	250320	back into the brotherhood you spent years among a group of people who did not care one lick for
250320	254960	the virtue of forgiveness and now you are surprised that when you have to ask for forgiveness they're
254960	259680	not going to give it to you these same people always crow about believing victims telling
259680	263520	victims of public dogpiles that they do not deserve to claim their trauma let alone to process
263520	267600	it because they deserved it there is no such thing as cancer culture there is no incentive reward
267600	272000	structure in places like twitter to call people out there are no updoets faves follows retweets
272000	275920	for hotting a take on whomever is trending remember you didn't say this lindsey but you
275920	281120	absolutely love the person that did everything is sexist everything is racist everything is
281120	286800	homophobic and you have to point it all out and now you are being called out i don't even agree
286800	291120	with what anita said here but these are the rules that you live by and they are the rules that you
291120	295840	are now dying by one of the most common tools of exclusion is through mobbing which is rarely
295840	300000	talked about because unlike rape or murder it's not easy to pin it on a single person or scapegoat
300000	304160	mobbing is emotional abuse practiced by a group of people usually peers over a period of time
304160	308320	through methods such as gaslighting rumor mongering and ostracism it's most documented
308320	313520	in workplace or academic environments key points of capitalist tension it's capitalism it's done
313520	318480	this to you lindsey isn't it your own capitalist success has made the rabble who watch you decide
318480	322480	to overthrow the system but is thoroughly institutionalized into feminist queer and
322480	326960	radical spaces as well almost like it's not fucking capitalist one it has an unusually
326960	330480	strong power to damage the victim's relationship to society because it can't be written off as an
330480	334160	outlier as some singular monster it reveals a fundamental truth about people that makes
334160	337600	it difficult to trust ever again people become like aliens like a pack of animals that can turn
337600	341840	on you as soon as some mysterious pheromone shift marks you for death you wanted collectivism and
341840	346480	now you have the justice of the mob to the insidious nature of emotional abuse how do you
346480	352160	fight ostracism and rumors they leave no bruises they just starve you every youtuber has had some
352160	356640	level of rumor spread about them all the time there's so much false shit about me online it's
356880	360800	beggar's belief but you know what i just keep making videos i don't look at it i don't care
360800	365280	i go offline we need to go offline i hang out with people irl when i need to like it's the internet
365280	369600	dude chill three mobbing typically occurs in places where the victim is trapped by some need
369600	376000	or obligation work school circles and friends twitter twitter is not a place of need or
376000	381600	obligation turn it off the isabel fall case is almost a textbook example of how online mobbing
381600	385600	harms people how the people who participate in these mobs never engage in any self-reflection
385600	390160	when some people read falls helicopter story and questioned the trans botafides of the author in
390160	394880	early 2020 twitter did what twitter does and ruined falls life death by a million cuts no
394880	398640	one single person even beginning to question whether they did anything wrong by jumping to
398640	402480	the worst possible faith and interpretation of both the text and the author one of isabel
402480	407440	falls detractors neon yang became the new scapegoat using some of the same tactics used
407440	411200	the prior year to attack fall i'm not going to touch on yang's original comments about fall or
411200	414560	the pushback to them but what was downright charming and its lack of self-awareness about
414560	419440	the whole thing was the way people used falls trauma to attack yang the way that they invoked
419440	423920	fall being checked into the hospital while yang said whatever about fall all the while having no
423920	427760	idea what was going on in yang's private life what's particularly galling is how many people
427760	432720	accused yang of sending a trans person to the hospital of ptsd while apparently being completely
432720	436640	oblivious to the fact they could very well be doing the same thing to yang a non-binary trans
436640	440560	person there was no lesson learned on the nature of mindless dogpiling just twitter doing what
440560	444800	twitter does and this is actually a very interesting part because it is describing how
444800	449280	the left eats its own you have isabel fall who wrote a story called helicopter story people
449280	453520	thought that was a reference to the attack helicopter meme so a bunch of trans people
453520	458960	dogpiled her and she ended up institutionalized for a short while one of the prominent dogpilers
458960	464800	was neon yang and later on for another event neon yang got dogpiled by the same people and one of
464800	469760	the things they attacked neon yang with was saying how audacious it was that neon yang
469760	475680	attacked isabelle fall during that previous event even though they also all attacked isabelle fall
475680	480240	in the same way and you get people like this on twitter who kind of prove lindsey ellis right
480240	485200	lindsey ellis a new york times best-selling author comparing herself to isabelle fall a
485200	489520	trans woman who was harassed to the point of near suicide for a short story she wrote and then going
489520	494320	on to defend the person who did the harassing is a truly an apt send-off there are so many other
494320	498160	examples she could have used for comparison maybe don't use a trans woman who didn't even get to
498160	503040	fully begin her career while ellis enjoys a career as a successful and well-loved author and video
503040	507200	essayist listen i thought the defense of neon yang in an essay about leaving youtube was weird
507200	511440	and even weirder when she implied that it was mostly cis straight men criticizing them when
511440	516400	in reality it was mostly other trans people so excuse me if i call that out point it all out this
516400	522560	person is doing the exact thing that lindsey ellis is criticizing the entire left for like
522560	527520	this passage doesn't even come to yang's defense it just draws parallels between the two but this
527520	533040	is the nature of the online left both the socialists and the progs and lindsey the
533040	537840	reason that you are so inundated with this is because these are the people you courted as your
537840	541760	audience i court edge lords i court people who are interested in humor i court people who can
541760	546000	laugh at everyone in a non-partisan way people who aren't strictly leftist or strictly rightist that's
546000	550080	why i'm not afraid of it but you chose this something else that was also inevitable i was
550080	553120	going to quit youtube i knew i couldn't do it forever that i was running out of steam that i
553120	557040	was sick of the increasing dehumanization inherent that i just didn't have anything to say about
557040	561120	movies anymore what happened to me in march and april hastened it this was always inevitable now
561120	564960	if you fall out of love with a platform or a project that's fine happens everybody i mean the
564960	568560	main reason i'm still going is because i love doing what i do i've reinvented this channel
568560	572320	several times but i've never seriously ever thought of quitting my initial plan was to leave
572320	576400	youtube for nebula but i realize now that this is only entrenching myself in a more intimate form of
576400	580400	harm rather than the broad buckshot kind that youtube invites i won't go into detail but i
580400	584960	can't do video content for them either i can't make content period i just can't do this anymore
584960	588480	there is no healing as long as there's attachment to the thing that makes you suffer and the thing
588480	592560	in this case is being in the public eye at all you go back and you watch really old lindsey ellis
592560	596400	videos we're talking like that guy with the glasses ear stuff when she was the nostalgia check
596400	601840	she is bright she is happy to be there she has interesting things to say even in old vlogs she's
601840	607200	very clearly like quite leftist but she seems like she would be a genuinely fun person to be
607200	612160	around and now she isn't she's exactly as she said she's been hollowed out but it wasn't by age
612160	618960	despite all of the jokes about her current looks i'm married wow me too um i'm flattered you know
618960	623360	and i and i get that you've been trying really really hard to get my attention you know for
623360	629920	obvious reasons but again i'm married uh i don't think it would really work out between us honestly
629920	634880	you're a little old for me but i find it really interesting how you wish to personalize this
634880	642800	because lindsey if we have to do this let's have a conversation about attractiveness shall we
642800	648480	because i don't know whether you recall but we've seen you from the side and i don't want
648480	654560	to be brutal about it but i'm not terribly impressed i happen to notice you've also had
654560	660000	an abortion and then made a movie about an abortion now i as a father of three and with
660000	665360	a very healthy and happy fat bouncing baby i'm not very attracted to the kind of woman who would
665360	670240	have bought her own child before she was born i think that's really gross but then i looked at
670240	679440	your wikipedia page it says you're 37 37 i'm 41 lindsey my wife is five years younger than you
679440	683200	and it wasn't even by her audience even though her audience is a big part of it
683200	689600	it was by her own politics broad spectrum leftist politics it's like heroin it feels really good
689600	694800	it's really pleasurable it's addictive but its corrupting influence does eventually destroy you
694800	699120	and you either drive away the good people who are around you or those people turn it just as
699120	703360	bad as you what i wanted was to quietly disappear but since this is a platform where people are
703360	707520	paying me to make content i feel like i have to make a statement if it were just me by myself
707520	711280	i would just sign off and say goodbye and that would be it but i have a team who depends on my
711280	714320	company for health insurance and including dependents i supply full benefits for eight
714320	718080	people and here in the us employer-based insurance is often the only feasible option
718080	721120	saying to everyone sorry about your children but they can't have insurance anymore because twitter
721120	725360	makes me sad just doesn't seem like a fair deal none of them incidentally know i'm posting this
725360	731520	hold on you're you're quitting you're running a company you got employees and this is how they
731520	736960	know this is how they learn that they're losing their jobs what the fuck the only thing i can do
736960	740800	for now is keep this page active with the loose promise that someday i'll figure out something to
740880	745360	in the future to make up for this while asking you please stop messaging me for apologizing for not
745360	749040	being able to subscribe anymore you don't owe me anything this patreon is like my own life and
749040	753200	career just running on fumes okay let me translate these past two these past two paragraphs for you
753200	758640	i have a business i have financial obligations to people who work for me i will be legally and
758640	764320	morally fucked if i renege on those obligations so even though i'm not producing anything i'm just
764320	768560	going to leave my patreon up knowing that a lot of people who currently monthly subscribe to me
768560	771360	they have probably forgotten that they're doing it and they're not entirely paying
771360	776240	attention anymore and i just want to keep that passive income rolling in this is exploitative
776240	781040	as fuck dude but all i know now is that being in the public eye at all is a losing game and
781040	784720	i regret all of it i regret every time i've ever stood up for anyone it always backfires
784720	789120	i regret every time i've pushed back and something unjust it was always just used to hurt me i regret
789120	792480	every time i've ever stood up for myself i never did it correctly i regret every time i ever showed
792480	796400	any vulnerability just my ammunition to be used against me later i regret every time i ever tried
796400	800000	to play the game with peers and colleagues they will drop you the second you aren't popular on
800000	804320	twitter anymore it's all hollow and brittle if there's one thing i've learned this year it is
804320	808320	how eminently expendable i am it's amazing because it's the complete opposite for me
808320	812640	i don't regret any time i've stood up for anybody i have said unpopular things and i have had people
812640	816720	get mad at me but it was the right thing to do because i believed in it i don't regret any time
816720	821040	i've pushed back against something unjust even if i lose and everything falls apart i can at least
821040	825360	sleep at night i don't regret any time i stood up for myself in fact i should have done it more
825360	830160	i don't regret any time i showed any vulnerability there were some people who poked fun at me for it
830160	834000	and that's fine that's what banter is all about and i don't regret any of the friends that i've
834000	838800	made in this space even the ones who have backstabbed me i'm happy to have at this point
838800	844080	several friend groups full of people who genuinely like me and i genuinely like them it might suck
844080	849200	that friendship wasn't real where you were lindsey but it's definitely real over here the good
849200	855280	progressive cis straight wealthy white men keep on trucking and coming out on top because deep down
855280	859280	they know that the systems they profess to stand against ultimately exist to benefit them
859280	865520	well i'm not a good progressive cis straight wealthy white man it turns out it's almost like
865520	870880	it's your side of politics that has the misogyny problem that has the sexism problem that has the
870880	876080	racism problem now don't get me wrong the uh the right definitely has problems that are akin to
876080	879760	those but the left is not immune it's the people who are unaligned it's the people who are in the
879760	885040	center it's the people who do not subscribe to the left-right dichotomy it's the individualists
885040	889760	we're the ones who don't have these problems and so there it is lindsey ellis has taken off guys
889760	894560	and to be honest people on the left right now are overwhelmingly proving her right in some respects
894560	899360	has lindsey ellis considered the possibility she's kind of a whack bitch defending a rich white woman
899360	904240	with a victim complex while calling pocs incredibly sensitive and making up some bullshit scenario
904240	908800	to explain the way the criticism is just beyond parody lindsey ellis being harassed sucks but
908800	913040	lindsey ellis was racist in her portrayal of indigenous people with the portrayal of the
913040	918160	kulat tribe in the twilight series it is not poc's responsibility to protect white people
918160	924880	when we call them out point it all out my empathy for lindsey ellis is severely limited because what
924880	930080	is happening to her not only did her audience do to other people and not only did she cultivate
930080	936080	that audience with that attitude but she has done it to people herself she did it to rose of dawn
936080	940880	she did it to tom scott she certainly helped do it to doug walker and everyone over at that guy
940880	946320	with the glasses and trust me those guys weren't perfect either but lindsey acted ridiculously in
946320	951600	that scenario and possibly most famously of all she helped do it to movie bob now movie bob
952560	959120	he he really fucking asked for it but still even in her apology video she doesn't really apologize
959120	964240	like one other person i owe an apology to is movie bob i told him on twitter to leave me alone because
964240	969120	he was acting like a creep by being over familiar and continually signaling to the world that were
969120	974560	friends and he he was acting like a creep and we're not friends but i would have never done
974560	978640	that if i had known that the diet nazis were going to turn that into a meme like i don't like a lot
978640	983920	of what he says on twitter either but please stop using my face to torture this man leave him alone
983920	990640	like listen to the arrogance coming out of this woman yes i know that the sun god king rays of
990640	996080	lindsey ellis will not shine down upon the lambs of movie bob but do not torment him in his darkness
996080	1001200	just leave him to rot peasants jesus christ i don't know if lindsey ellis is actually going
1001200	1006320	anywhere or not who knows she pulls this stunt every six months she's deleted her twitter before
1006320	1009600	and like i'm done i'm done with all this shit and she comes back a couple days later she has
1009600	1015600	repeatedly self-destructed in a spectacular public fashion phil fish style so this could be her
1015600	1018720	trying to get more relevance but it also could be her legitimately leaving doesn't really matter
1018720	1023920	though because aside from her self-destructions lindsey ellis at this point seems to be kind of
1023920	1029280	irrelevant oh well the end of another old guard youtube channel happens all the time nowadays
