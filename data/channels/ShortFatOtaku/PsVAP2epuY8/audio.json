{"text": " extra extra read all about it lindsey ellis is leaving the internet well she's leaving youtube anyway yesterday she posted this on her patreon it cost two dollars to get in but uh i ain't paying for it it's on archive.today walking away from omeleus omeleus well i don't know what this is this is going to be a youtube video but i just don't have it in me to invite that kind of scrutiny to be the last in the sex sad line of youtubers to get all weepy on camera and crap about the how just can't do this anymore boo hoo hoo i wonder if she's expecting empathy for herself even though she doesn't give it to other people i had planned to move video content to nebulae but i realize now that doing that is just keeping wounds wide open my life ended nine months ago what has been taking up bandwidth ever since then has been a ghost are you serious i know you got cancelled nine months ago i did a video on it but this is histrionic lindsey chill out man ain't that bad just just walk away from the screen turn the pc off go outside it'll be okay it's almost funny how many people will insist that i have lost nothing you know because subscriber count is the only metric for success and cancel culture doesn't exist one youtube channel checking along on algorithmic inertia is not success it's just an engine driving on fumes you know i uh wouldn't mind those subs i wouldn't mind that algorithmic inertia hey how about this just give me your channel lindsey it'll be okay right you don't want it anymore many will say this is being melodramatic that my life isn't over that there was absolutely nothing stopping me from brushing myself off building back up goodwill and shutting up and playing the game and i tried that in a way i suppose it's good that i did because i needed to learn the hard way this is never going to work there's no unfucking this you can't find the energy if there's nothing left to convert to it you can't be a better person if you're nothing but the hollow shell of one well lindsey you brought this on yourself you weren't a good person progressive leftist politics do not create good people you cultivated an audience of bitter failures who took it out on you because you were not a bitter failure i'm not an idiot for being canceled by my audience even if i disagree with my audience even if i even if i put out a video that no one likes and i just say you know what no every single one of you is wrong even if i get into a knockdown drag out fight with my audience i never fear being canceled because you attracted the terrible people with your own terribleness i didn't do that sargon didn't do that even people like destiny didn't do that we all have audiences who value free speech which means inherently valuing disagreement you rejected that and now you are here 2021 has been the worst year of my life i'm traumatized by it to this day i still have people scolding me about how i handled it i should have handled it differently i should have controlled my stance if i had the capability to know what any of these people are even saying to strangers on twitter while i was shitting blood for weeks on it what the fuck shitting blood are you sure there's not something else happening here the worst thing about this whole year is that i can't even admit this trauma because all the rhetorical devices people have already come up with to dismiss it that centering my own pain is evidence of me not listening does it occur to these people that you can listen and disagree with people's conclusions no it doesn't and you wanted it that way you wanted to be able to shut down everybody who went against you everybody who disagreed with your politics and now it's being used on you that i'm weaponizing my fragile white womanhood or whatever to point out that having thousands upon thousands of people who you have never met hate you and say whatever will get them the most up-dutes about it is in fact traumatizing you wanted it this way you discarded real equality for equity and now that has been turned around on you that people i used to know would fragrantly lie about me on twitter.com to the tune of thousands of retweets and tens of thousands of likes i just had to sit there and take it again you did the exact same thing to a lot of people you used to know my favorite are the people who dismiss any potential harm i might have incurred as justified because i'm a wealthy white woman i'm not wealthy um you're wealthier than most people let's be honest these people don't see how similar these talking points are to the same boomer bootstrap parenting style that i thought most of us agree was abusive you need to toughen up accept your punishment except that even if the reaction was outsized you did something wrong because where there's smoke there's fire you cultivated that attitude even the most repressive religions have a pathway to salvation your ethical system is more immoral than like islams because at least with them if you repent you're welcomed back into the brotherhood you spent years among a group of people who did not care one lick for the virtue of forgiveness and now you are surprised that when you have to ask for forgiveness they're not going to give it to you these same people always crow about believing victims telling victims of public dogpiles that they do not deserve to claim their trauma let alone to process it because they deserved it there is no such thing as cancer culture there is no incentive reward structure in places like twitter to call people out there are no updoets faves follows retweets for hotting a take on whomever is trending remember you didn't say this lindsey but you absolutely love the person that did everything is sexist everything is racist everything is homophobic and you have to point it all out and now you are being called out i don't even agree with what anita said here but these are the rules that you live by and they are the rules that you are now dying by one of the most common tools of exclusion is through mobbing which is rarely talked about because unlike rape or murder it's not easy to pin it on a single person or scapegoat mobbing is emotional abuse practiced by a group of people usually peers over a period of time through methods such as gaslighting rumor mongering and ostracism it's most documented in workplace or academic environments key points of capitalist tension it's capitalism it's done this to you lindsey isn't it your own capitalist success has made the rabble who watch you decide to overthrow the system but is thoroughly institutionalized into feminist queer and radical spaces as well almost like it's not fucking capitalist one it has an unusually strong power to damage the victim's relationship to society because it can't be written off as an outlier as some singular monster it reveals a fundamental truth about people that makes it difficult to trust ever again people become like aliens like a pack of animals that can turn on you as soon as some mysterious pheromone shift marks you for death you wanted collectivism and now you have the justice of the mob to the insidious nature of emotional abuse how do you fight ostracism and rumors they leave no bruises they just starve you every youtuber has had some level of rumor spread about them all the time there's so much false shit about me online it's beggar's belief but you know what i just keep making videos i don't look at it i don't care i go offline we need to go offline i hang out with people irl when i need to like it's the internet dude chill three mobbing typically occurs in places where the victim is trapped by some need or obligation work school circles and friends twitter twitter is not a place of need or obligation turn it off the isabel fall case is almost a textbook example of how online mobbing harms people how the people who participate in these mobs never engage in any self-reflection when some people read falls helicopter story and questioned the trans botafides of the author in early 2020 twitter did what twitter does and ruined falls life death by a million cuts no one single person even beginning to question whether they did anything wrong by jumping to the worst possible faith and interpretation of both the text and the author one of isabel falls detractors neon yang became the new scapegoat using some of the same tactics used the prior year to attack fall i'm not going to touch on yang's original comments about fall or the pushback to them but what was downright charming and its lack of self-awareness about the whole thing was the way people used falls trauma to attack yang the way that they invoked fall being checked into the hospital while yang said whatever about fall all the while having no idea what was going on in yang's private life what's particularly galling is how many people accused yang of sending a trans person to the hospital of ptsd while apparently being completely oblivious to the fact they could very well be doing the same thing to yang a non-binary trans person there was no lesson learned on the nature of mindless dogpiling just twitter doing what twitter does and this is actually a very interesting part because it is describing how the left eats its own you have isabel fall who wrote a story called helicopter story people thought that was a reference to the attack helicopter meme so a bunch of trans people dogpiled her and she ended up institutionalized for a short while one of the prominent dogpilers was neon yang and later on for another event neon yang got dogpiled by the same people and one of the things they attacked neon yang with was saying how audacious it was that neon yang attacked isabelle fall during that previous event even though they also all attacked isabelle fall in the same way and you get people like this on twitter who kind of prove lindsey ellis right lindsey ellis a new york times best-selling author comparing herself to isabelle fall a trans woman who was harassed to the point of near suicide for a short story she wrote and then going on to defend the person who did the harassing is a truly an apt send-off there are so many other examples she could have used for comparison maybe don't use a trans woman who didn't even get to fully begin her career while ellis enjoys a career as a successful and well-loved author and video essayist listen i thought the defense of neon yang in an essay about leaving youtube was weird and even weirder when she implied that it was mostly cis straight men criticizing them when in reality it was mostly other trans people so excuse me if i call that out point it all out this person is doing the exact thing that lindsey ellis is criticizing the entire left for like this passage doesn't even come to yang's defense it just draws parallels between the two but this is the nature of the online left both the socialists and the progs and lindsey the reason that you are so inundated with this is because these are the people you courted as your audience i court edge lords i court people who are interested in humor i court people who can laugh at everyone in a non-partisan way people who aren't strictly leftist or strictly rightist that's why i'm not afraid of it but you chose this something else that was also inevitable i was going to quit youtube i knew i couldn't do it forever that i was running out of steam that i was sick of the increasing dehumanization inherent that i just didn't have anything to say about movies anymore what happened to me in march and april hastened it this was always inevitable now if you fall out of love with a platform or a project that's fine happens everybody i mean the main reason i'm still going is because i love doing what i do i've reinvented this channel several times but i've never seriously ever thought of quitting my initial plan was to leave youtube for nebula but i realize now that this is only entrenching myself in a more intimate form of harm rather than the broad buckshot kind that youtube invites i won't go into detail but i can't do video content for them either i can't make content period i just can't do this anymore there is no healing as long as there's attachment to the thing that makes you suffer and the thing in this case is being in the public eye at all you go back and you watch really old lindsey ellis videos we're talking like that guy with the glasses ear stuff when she was the nostalgia check she is bright she is happy to be there she has interesting things to say even in old vlogs she's very clearly like quite leftist but she seems like she would be a genuinely fun person to be around and now she isn't she's exactly as she said she's been hollowed out but it wasn't by age despite all of the jokes about her current looks i'm married wow me too um i'm flattered you know and i and i get that you've been trying really really hard to get my attention you know for obvious reasons but again i'm married uh i don't think it would really work out between us honestly you're a little old for me but i find it really interesting how you wish to personalize this because lindsey if we have to do this let's have a conversation about attractiveness shall we because i don't know whether you recall but we've seen you from the side and i don't want to be brutal about it but i'm not terribly impressed i happen to notice you've also had an abortion and then made a movie about an abortion now i as a father of three and with a very healthy and happy fat bouncing baby i'm not very attracted to the kind of woman who would have bought her own child before she was born i think that's really gross but then i looked at your wikipedia page it says you're 37 37 i'm 41 lindsey my wife is five years younger than you and it wasn't even by her audience even though her audience is a big part of it it was by her own politics broad spectrum leftist politics it's like heroin it feels really good it's really pleasurable it's addictive but its corrupting influence does eventually destroy you and you either drive away the good people who are around you or those people turn it just as bad as you what i wanted was to quietly disappear but since this is a platform where people are paying me to make content i feel like i have to make a statement if it were just me by myself i would just sign off and say goodbye and that would be it but i have a team who depends on my company for health insurance and including dependents i supply full benefits for eight people and here in the us employer-based insurance is often the only feasible option saying to everyone sorry about your children but they can't have insurance anymore because twitter makes me sad just doesn't seem like a fair deal none of them incidentally know i'm posting this hold on you're you're quitting you're running a company you got employees and this is how they know this is how they learn that they're losing their jobs what the fuck the only thing i can do for now is keep this page active with the loose promise that someday i'll figure out something to in the future to make up for this while asking you please stop messaging me for apologizing for not being able to subscribe anymore you don't owe me anything this patreon is like my own life and career just running on fumes okay let me translate these past two these past two paragraphs for you i have a business i have financial obligations to people who work for me i will be legally and morally fucked if i renege on those obligations so even though i'm not producing anything i'm just going to leave my patreon up knowing that a lot of people who currently monthly subscribe to me they have probably forgotten that they're doing it and they're not entirely paying attention anymore and i just want to keep that passive income rolling in this is exploitative as fuck dude but all i know now is that being in the public eye at all is a losing game and i regret all of it i regret every time i've ever stood up for anyone it always backfires i regret every time i've pushed back and something unjust it was always just used to hurt me i regret every time i've ever stood up for myself i never did it correctly i regret every time i ever showed any vulnerability just my ammunition to be used against me later i regret every time i ever tried to play the game with peers and colleagues they will drop you the second you aren't popular on twitter anymore it's all hollow and brittle if there's one thing i've learned this year it is how eminently expendable i am it's amazing because it's the complete opposite for me i don't regret any time i've stood up for anybody i have said unpopular things and i have had people get mad at me but it was the right thing to do because i believed in it i don't regret any time i've pushed back against something unjust even if i lose and everything falls apart i can at least sleep at night i don't regret any time i stood up for myself in fact i should have done it more i don't regret any time i showed any vulnerability there were some people who poked fun at me for it and that's fine that's what banter is all about and i don't regret any of the friends that i've made in this space even the ones who have backstabbed me i'm happy to have at this point several friend groups full of people who genuinely like me and i genuinely like them it might suck that friendship wasn't real where you were lindsey but it's definitely real over here the good progressive cis straight wealthy white men keep on trucking and coming out on top because deep down they know that the systems they profess to stand against ultimately exist to benefit them well i'm not a good progressive cis straight wealthy white man it turns out it's almost like it's your side of politics that has the misogyny problem that has the sexism problem that has the racism problem now don't get me wrong the uh the right definitely has problems that are akin to those but the left is not immune it's the people who are unaligned it's the people who are in the center it's the people who do not subscribe to the left-right dichotomy it's the individualists we're the ones who don't have these problems and so there it is lindsey ellis has taken off guys and to be honest people on the left right now are overwhelmingly proving her right in some respects has lindsey ellis considered the possibility she's kind of a whack bitch defending a rich white woman with a victim complex while calling pocs incredibly sensitive and making up some bullshit scenario to explain the way the criticism is just beyond parody lindsey ellis being harassed sucks but lindsey ellis was racist in her portrayal of indigenous people with the portrayal of the kulat tribe in the twilight series it is not poc's responsibility to protect white people when we call them out point it all out my empathy for lindsey ellis is severely limited because what is happening to her not only did her audience do to other people and not only did she cultivate that audience with that attitude but she has done it to people herself she did it to rose of dawn she did it to tom scott she certainly helped do it to doug walker and everyone over at that guy with the glasses and trust me those guys weren't perfect either but lindsey acted ridiculously in that scenario and possibly most famously of all she helped do it to movie bob now movie bob he he really fucking asked for it but still even in her apology video she doesn't really apologize like one other person i owe an apology to is movie bob i told him on twitter to leave me alone because he was acting like a creep by being over familiar and continually signaling to the world that were friends and he he was acting like a creep and we're not friends but i would have never done that if i had known that the diet nazis were going to turn that into a meme like i don't like a lot of what he says on twitter either but please stop using my face to torture this man leave him alone like listen to the arrogance coming out of this woman yes i know that the sun god king rays of lindsey ellis will not shine down upon the lambs of movie bob but do not torment him in his darkness just leave him to rot peasants jesus christ i don't know if lindsey ellis is actually going anywhere or not who knows she pulls this stunt every six months she's deleted her twitter before and like i'm done i'm done with all this shit and she comes back a couple days later she has repeatedly self-destructed in a spectacular public fashion phil fish style so this could be her trying to get more relevance but it also could be her legitimately leaving doesn't really matter though because aside from her self-destructions lindsey ellis at this point seems to be kind of irrelevant oh well the end of another old guard youtube channel happens all the time nowadays goodbye and good luck nostalgic here's some advice for your next adventure watch who you get in bed with and over the last few years i have had so many of my colleagues all of them women people of color trans people queer people or some combination of the above voice to me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will get them on the bad side of their own communities i didn't start getting noticeable harassment from the purity tester brigade until i stood up for a trans woman on twitter and that backlash did not come from the alt-right or even the diet nazis but
