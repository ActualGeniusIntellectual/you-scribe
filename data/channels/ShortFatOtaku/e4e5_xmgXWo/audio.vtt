00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
I was gonna do the next Indefensible tonight, but I don't think I really have the heart to do it right now.

00:06.500 --> 00:13.100
For those of you who don't know, Nintendo's fourth president, Satoru Iwata, passed away today.

00:13.100 --> 00:18.700
And, like so many big names at Nintendo, he wasn't just a president or just a CEO.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.800
He connected with a lot of gamers everywhere.

00:21.800 --> 00:26.900
I mean, just looking over what he's done before he became CEO, he did Balloon Fight,

00:26.900 --> 00:30.500
he worked on Kirby with Sakurai, he helped with Earthbound.

00:30.500 --> 00:36.400
You know, these are formative games, not just popular Nintendo titles.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.100
They're part of gaming history.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.700
Up until Iwata, Nintendo was basically a family-run company.

00:41.700 --> 00:45.300
Its first three presidents were all from the Yamauchi family.

00:45.300 --> 00:51.900
And when Iwata was given the mantle in 2002, it was because Nintendo needed somebody

00:51.900 --> 00:58.100
who was not just a good president, but also a good game developer and a good gamer.

00:58.100 --> 01:02.100
He would later go on to prove this by spearheading the Nintendo DS,

01:02.100 --> 01:05.900
which was by far Nintendo's most popular handheld,

01:05.900 --> 01:10.700
and he also pushed development on the Wii, which became one of Nintendo's most popular consoles.

01:10.700 --> 01:17.700
Both of these systems that he helped design were very unique amongst Nintendo's normal offerings,

01:17.700 --> 01:22.500
in that they really expanded on what it meant to play a game.

01:22.500 --> 01:26.700
The Nintendo DS basically popularized touchscreen gaming,

01:26.700 --> 01:31.500
and the Wii, for better or worse, brought motion control to the forefront.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.100
And I know there's a lot of shovelware on the Wii, there's a lot of games that really aren't that good,

01:36.100 --> 01:39.900
but at the same time, when the Wii worked, it really worked.

01:39.900 --> 01:45.300
And both the DS and the Wii have some of Nintendo's best games on them.

01:45.300 --> 01:49.500
Iwata was also special not just as a businessman, but also as a personality.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.900
He understood the importance of reaching out and connecting with the audience,

01:53.900 --> 01:56.100
in a way that his predecessors didn't.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.300
Miyamoto always, you know, flirted with the fan base.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.100
And of course, Reggie became a meme.

02:01.100 --> 02:05.700
But with the Nintendo Directs, Iwata reached out in a way that...

02:05.700 --> 02:11.700
I think no CEO, in gaming or otherwise, has ever before or since.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.500
Iwata wasn't present at 2014's E3,

02:15.500 --> 02:19.100
and it was publicly stated because of medical-related reasons.

02:19.100 --> 02:22.100
And part of me is now wondering that...

02:22.100 --> 02:28.100
maybe the reason there was all that fun and cool puppet stuff at this year's E3

02:28.100 --> 02:33.100
was because Iwata didn't want us to see him in the state he was.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.900
And I don't think that's a prideful gesture,

02:34.900 --> 02:38.500
I think that's the kind of person that Iwata ultimately was.

02:38.500 --> 02:43.900
I mean, he's the guy who took a massive pay cut when the Wii U failed.

02:43.900 --> 02:47.100
That is unheard of in the realm of modern CEOs,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.500
for someone to take that much responsibility

02:49.500 --> 02:50.700
to actually say,

02:50.700 --> 02:52.900
the buck stops here and mean it.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.100
I think ultimately what Iwata desired

02:56.100 --> 02:59.900
was for the spotlight to be on Nintendo's offerings at E3,

02:59.900 --> 03:01.500
rather than on his health.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.700
And for that, he should be commended.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.500
I think it's also very telling,

03:06.500 --> 03:10.700
as a testament to the kind of guy that he was,

03:10.700 --> 03:15.100
that the last thing Iwata did publicly before his death

03:15.100 --> 03:18.300
was apologize for Nintendo's E3 showing.

03:18.300 --> 03:22.700
He knew that pretty much everybody was disappointed,

03:22.700 --> 03:24.100
and he was sorry.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.100
I just hope that he didn't go,

03:26.100 --> 03:30.500
thinking that we had all given up on what he considered to be one of his greatest works.

03:30.500 --> 03:34.100
I think it goes without saying that everybody is going to miss him.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.100
Thanks for playing, Iwata.

03:36.500 --> 03:48.100
Thanks for watching!
