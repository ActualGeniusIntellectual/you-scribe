1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
I was gonna do the next Indefensible tonight, but I don't think I really have the heart to do it right now.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,100
For those of you who don't know, Nintendo's fourth president, Satoru Iwata, passed away today.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,700
And, like so many big names at Nintendo, he wasn't just a president or just a CEO.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,800
He connected with a lot of gamers everywhere.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,900
I mean, just looking over what he's done before he became CEO, he did Balloon Fight,

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,500
he worked on Kirby with Sakurai, he helped with Earthbound.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,400
You know, these are formative games, not just popular Nintendo titles.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,100
They're part of gaming history.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,700
Up until Iwata, Nintendo was basically a family-run company.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,300
Its first three presidents were all from the Yamauchi family.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,900
And when Iwata was given the mantle in 2002, it was because Nintendo needed somebody

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,100
who was not just a good president, but also a good game developer and a good gamer.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,100
He would later go on to prove this by spearheading the Nintendo DS,

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,900
which was by far Nintendo's most popular handheld,

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,700
and he also pushed development on the Wii, which became one of Nintendo's most popular consoles.

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,700
Both of these systems that he helped design were very unique amongst Nintendo's normal offerings,

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,500
in that they really expanded on what it meant to play a game.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,700
The Nintendo DS basically popularized touchscreen gaming,

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,500
and the Wii, for better or worse, brought motion control to the forefront.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,100
And I know there's a lot of shovelware on the Wii, there's a lot of games that really aren't that good,

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,900
but at the same time, when the Wii worked, it really worked.

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,300
And both the DS and the Wii have some of Nintendo's best games on them.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Iwata was also special not just as a businessman, but also as a personality.

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,900
He understood the importance of reaching out and connecting with the audience,

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,100
in a way that his predecessors didn't.

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,300
Miyamoto always, you know, flirted with the fan base.

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,100
And of course, Reggie became a meme.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,700
But with the Nintendo Directs, Iwata reached out in a way that...

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,700
I think no CEO, in gaming or otherwise, has ever before or since.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,500
Iwata wasn't present at 2014's E3,

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,100
and it was publicly stated because of medical-related reasons.

32
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,100
And part of me is now wondering that...

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,100
maybe the reason there was all that fun and cool puppet stuff at this year's E3

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,100
was because Iwata didn't want us to see him in the state he was.

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,900
And I don't think that's a prideful gesture,

36
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,500
I think that's the kind of person that Iwata ultimately was.

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,900
I mean, he's the guy who took a massive pay cut when the Wii U failed.

38
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,100
That is unheard of in the realm of modern CEOs,

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,500
for someone to take that much responsibility

40
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,700
to actually say,

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,900
the buck stops here and mean it.

42
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,100
I think ultimately what Iwata desired

43
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,900
was for the spotlight to be on Nintendo's offerings at E3,

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
rather than on his health.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,700
And for that, he should be commended.

46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,500
I think it's also very telling,

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,700
as a testament to the kind of guy that he was,

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,100
that the last thing Iwata did publicly before his death

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,300
was apologize for Nintendo's E3 showing.

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,700
He knew that pretty much everybody was disappointed,

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,100
and he was sorry.

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
I just hope that he didn't go,

53
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,500
thinking that we had all given up on what he considered to be one of his greatest works.

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,100
I think it goes without saying that everybody is going to miss him.

55
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Thanks for playing, Iwata.

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:48,100
Thanks for watching!
