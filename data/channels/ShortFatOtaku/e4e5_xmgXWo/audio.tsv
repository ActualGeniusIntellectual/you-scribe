0	6500	I was gonna do the next Indefensible tonight, but I don't think I really have the heart to do it right now.
6500	13100	For those of you who don't know, Nintendo's fourth president, Satoru Iwata, passed away today.
13100	18700	And, like so many big names at Nintendo, he wasn't just a president or just a CEO.
18700	21800	He connected with a lot of gamers everywhere.
21800	26900	I mean, just looking over what he's done before he became CEO, he did Balloon Fight,
26900	30500	he worked on Kirby with Sakurai, he helped with Earthbound.
30500	36400	You know, these are formative games, not just popular Nintendo titles.
36400	38100	They're part of gaming history.
38100	41700	Up until Iwata, Nintendo was basically a family-run company.
41700	45300	Its first three presidents were all from the Yamauchi family.
45300	51900	And when Iwata was given the mantle in 2002, it was because Nintendo needed somebody
51900	58100	who was not just a good president, but also a good game developer and a good gamer.
58100	62100	He would later go on to prove this by spearheading the Nintendo DS,
62100	65900	which was by far Nintendo's most popular handheld,
65900	70700	and he also pushed development on the Wii, which became one of Nintendo's most popular consoles.
70700	77700	Both of these systems that he helped design were very unique amongst Nintendo's normal offerings,
77700	82500	in that they really expanded on what it meant to play a game.
82500	86700	The Nintendo DS basically popularized touchscreen gaming,
86700	91500	and the Wii, for better or worse, brought motion control to the forefront.
91500	96100	And I know there's a lot of shovelware on the Wii, there's a lot of games that really aren't that good,
96100	99900	but at the same time, when the Wii worked, it really worked.
99900	105300	And both the DS and the Wii have some of Nintendo's best games on them.
105300	109500	Iwata was also special not just as a businessman, but also as a personality.
109500	113900	He understood the importance of reaching out and connecting with the audience,
113900	116100	in a way that his predecessors didn't.
116100	119300	Miyamoto always, you know, flirted with the fan base.
119300	121100	And of course, Reggie became a meme.
121100	125700	But with the Nintendo Directs, Iwata reached out in a way that...
125700	131700	I think no CEO, in gaming or otherwise, has ever before or since.
131700	135500	Iwata wasn't present at 2014's E3,
135500	139100	and it was publicly stated because of medical-related reasons.
139100	142100	And part of me is now wondering that...
142100	148100	maybe the reason there was all that fun and cool puppet stuff at this year's E3
148100	153100	was because Iwata didn't want us to see him in the state he was.
153100	154900	And I don't think that's a prideful gesture,
154900	158500	I think that's the kind of person that Iwata ultimately was.
158500	163900	I mean, he's the guy who took a massive pay cut when the Wii U failed.
163900	167100	That is unheard of in the realm of modern CEOs,
167100	169500	for someone to take that much responsibility
169500	170700	to actually say,
170700	172900	the buck stops here and mean it.
172900	176100	I think ultimately what Iwata desired
176100	179900	was for the spotlight to be on Nintendo's offerings at E3,
179900	181500	rather than on his health.
181500	183700	And for that, he should be commended.
183700	186500	I think it's also very telling,
186500	190700	as a testament to the kind of guy that he was,
190700	195100	that the last thing Iwata did publicly before his death
195100	198300	was apologize for Nintendo's E3 showing.
198300	202700	He knew that pretty much everybody was disappointed,
202700	204100	and he was sorry.
204100	206100	I just hope that he didn't go,
206100	210500	thinking that we had all given up on what he considered to be one of his greatest works.
210500	214100	I think it goes without saying that everybody is going to miss him.
214100	216100	Thanks for playing, Iwata.
216500	228100	Thanks for watching!
