0	11640	Haha, hey look at that, SFO classic.
11640	16120	Well we're talking about my demonetization today.
16120	20700	And frankly this is probably a video that'll get me laughed at by any detractors or hate
20700	24800	watchers that happen to be around, but I don't care, it's not for them.
24800	29920	It's for those people who watch me and like me and care about me and find the things that
29920	31480	I have to say interesting.
31480	37080	It's for those people that I say I love to at the end of not every but most of my videos.
37080	39560	So here it is, we can talk about it.
39560	41720	Your channel is no longer eligible to monetize.
41720	46040	This is not just taking all the videos and making them have yellow monetization symbols,
46040	48920	this is I cannot turn on monetization for the entire channel.
48920	49920	It's all gone.
49920	52480	The reason is harmful or hateful content.
52480	59880	As always the learn more there link brings you to a very unhelpful page where they tell
59880	64960	you about their terms of service, but it's purposefully so vague that I have no idea
64960	65960	what I did.
65960	68840	I have some idea about what I did, but we'll get to that.
68840	71480	I can reapply on October 31st, 2020.
71480	75200	And so fair enough, that is a month without getting paid.
75200	76200	That's not great.
76200	80040	Outside of the normal 30 day wait that this sort of thing happens for, I do happen to
80040	84440	know people who have an in at YouTube and so they ask what this was about.
84440	88200	However the report that came back from them was equally vague.
88200	92880	That it was a justified demonetization, not a mistake, for the purposes of harmful or
92880	93880	hateful content.
93880	97800	They didn't say what specific video triggered this or what changes I had to make.
97800	103880	However I was informed that for the first time in my channel's history my stream was
103880	105760	featured on YouTube's front page.
105760	109840	That was the stream where it was me, Arch, Lilith, and Scrump talking about the Trump
109840	111000	Biden debate.
111000	115320	And Scrump was drunk, dumb, and said the n-word a few times.
115320	117480	So frankly that was probably it.
117480	119860	Thanks Scrump, I appreciate it.
119860	124400	So I deleted the video, or the stream, the streambod, it's gone now, and I put up a couple
124400	132800	videos since the demonetization, and I realized that like, YouTube, YouTube still runs ads
132800	133800	on these videos.
133800	137560	I'm just not getting my cut, they just take the whole thing.
137560	142360	And I don't entirely mean to yuri post here, but it is demoralizing.
142360	146560	I consented to YouTube taking a portion of the revenue from my work because they provide
146560	149080	this service, and I get the rest.
149080	151000	I did not consent to do it for free.
151000	155440	And whenever I made a video, knowing full well that I wouldn't be getting paid for it
155440	160920	no matter how good the video was or how many hits it got or how many people liked it, um,
160920	165400	I realized I didn't want to do it, which is why you haven't seen much from me on this
165400	167400	channel since the demonetization.
167400	175200	And in case you guys haven't realized, um, I'm a real pussy, I don't know if you've noticed.
175200	181040	Like, I've lost friends to Trump Derangement Syndrome, and I've had to, you know, talk
181040	183440	about it a bit and be sad for a few days.
183440	188180	I've been maligned and misrepresented and ignored by people that I thought I was on
188180	192280	good terms with, I've been backstabbed and betrayed, I've had to deal with toxic people
192280	197560	from a variety of different communities, saying shit about me, making videos about me, writing
197560	202200	articles about me, and I can't pretend that I simply shrugged it off and went on with
202200	203200	my day.
203200	206280	Every time it happened, I had to stop for a bit.
206280	208880	Sometimes just an hour, sometimes an afternoon.
208880	209880	Not too long.
209880	214020	It's not like I was devastated for years and needed to save space, but I had to sit down
214020	222580	for a minute because generally when I interact with somebody, I assume that we're friends
222580	223580	until we're not.
223580	229000	I think it's a healthy way to do things because I want to invite the best parts of other people
229000	232680	forward and not the worst parts when we're interacting.
232680	235600	And that's not a process that I intend to stop.
235600	240240	But it has made it harder for me to deal with things when something goes wrong or something
240240	241240	falls through.
241240	243480	I don't think I'm capable of just shrugging it off.
243480	244480	Some people can.
244480	248000	Some people can be told that something bad has happened and here's what they have to
248000	249300	do and they can go off and do it.
249300	253320	I'm the type that has to sit there for a while and think about it, I think.
253320	258720	I got the first word back from that backdoor appeal this morning and it pretty much took
258720	260360	my afternoon out from under me.
260360	262320	I didn't seem to be capable of doing any real work.
262360	267280	I didn't seem to be capable of even having a positive attitude.
267280	270320	I just didn't want to do anything because it felt entirely hopeless.
270320	272320	Let's be honest, guys.
272320	275500	It's not hopeless, but I'm in a bad situation right now for sure.
275500	276500	This is not nothing.
276500	280200	And I'm not going to pretend that I'm completely feeling better.
280200	283800	The outlook is just as bleak as it was when I first found out about the news.
283800	287640	My chances of getting re-monetized are the exact same, but I guess before I can actually
287640	290840	get back to work, I just need to sit around and suffer for a little bit.
290880	292980	Maybe that's just my personality type, you know?
292980	293980	That probably makes me weak.
293980	298800	In any case, what's actually happening is I'm going through that backdoor again with
298800	301000	some modifications to the channel.
301000	303760	I changed a few of the spicier titles and thumbnails in the backlog.
303760	308880	I removed the offending stream where Scrump said his gamer words.
308880	314760	However, if they still come back and say no, there's still hate speech, I don't know what
314760	315880	to do.
315880	319600	I can wait it out for 30 days and do the normal appeals process, but there's no guarantee
319600	321800	I can come back.
321800	325720	I can ask the people that helped Dankula, because I know that he was demonetized for
325720	328720	years and he got it back.
328720	331280	But again, there's no guarantee that'll help either.
331280	333280	And really, the hardest part is the waiting.
333280	338440	If I was told that I'm just fucked, and there's no more monetization on this channel and it's
338440	341280	never coming back, I'd be like, okay, I'll start a new channel.
341280	342640	I'll just start a new channel right now.
342640	343640	Fuck it, you know?
343640	344640	We'll move on.
344640	345640	We'll do something else.
345640	346880	I know we have 90,000 subs here.
346880	351640	I know that probably, at best, one third of you would follow me over to the new one.
351640	352640	But you know what?
352640	353640	We'll rebuild.
353640	360520	But right now, until I get the word, it feels like a waste of time to put energy into a
360520	363260	channel that I might not even use.
363260	371680	That being said, I did reserve what I thought was a pretty funny name for it in Devonatized,
371680	373940	because why the fuck not, right?
373940	377520	So if I do have to move somewhere, it'll probably be here.
377520	383860	The whole short, fat otaku name came from 2009, where my friends and I made anime reviews.
383860	390140	Like that guy with the glasses, channel awesome, AVGN-styled reviews from that era of the internet.
390140	394340	And ever since I started doing political content on it, the name really never fit, did it?
394340	398060	I still like to watch anime sometimes, but that's not the focus of the channel anymore.
398060	402240	And my name is Dev, so Devonatized seems like it's a pretty good name.
402240	405560	So please consider subbing to that channel, I mean if we get a few thousand there I'll
405560	408520	probably use it for something anyway, because why not?
408520	413880	But I might end up needing to do a political analysis over there, if the re-monetization
413880	416080	efforts don't come through.
416080	419320	And of course, as always, there's ways to support the channel in the description of
419320	424140	this video and every other video, so if you feel like the content that I make, or made,
424140	428800	but I'll still make it somewhere, is worth your time and your money, then you can donate
428800	429800	there.
429800	433600	I will support this channel in the meantime, because that's the question, isn't it?
433600	437120	Like I said, I don't want to make videos, I just don't.
437120	439800	Not while YouTube's running ads on them and I'm not getting paid.
439800	443120	I will not support that kind of theft of my labour.
443120	445720	So I might just start streaming on the channel.
445720	452260	It might be a case where I simply run Streamlabs and stream every day, and we talk about the
452260	456660	news and we kind of go over some funny things maybe, and then at the end of the day, I take
456660	458160	the stream down.
458160	464680	Because again, I will not have YouTube run ads on any of my content unless I am making
464680	466980	at least part of the money for those ads.
466980	470520	So until this is settled, I think I'll be streaming.
470520	471920	I think that's the plan.
471920	474960	I know there are some of you who subbed who did not sign up for this.
474960	479520	You like the scripted videos, you like the pre-recorded videos, you're not here for a
479520	480520	stream.
480520	481520	I understand.
481520	483060	I'm sorry.
483060	487520	But it doesn't feel right for me to make videos and not get paid for them.
487880	489320	And I don't want to do the shilling thing.
489320	491280	I don't want to do the Raid Shadow Legends thing.
491280	492280	That's not for me.
492280	494920	I always told myself I wouldn't do that and I won't do it now.
494920	500640	I am not going to hawk a product at you that I don't use myself.
500640	503040	And most of these products I don't use myself.
503040	507880	So until monetization comes back, this will be a streaming channel.
507880	510720	And if it does come back, then things will go back to normal.
510720	512880	I hope you're not too disappointed.
513240	515280	I hope you won't leave over this.
515280	518480	And thank you very much for sticking through this with me.
518480	520240	I really do appreciate it.
520240	520740	I love you.
