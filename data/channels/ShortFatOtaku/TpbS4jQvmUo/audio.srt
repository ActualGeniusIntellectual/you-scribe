1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,640
Haha, hey look at that, SFO classic.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,120
Well we're talking about my demonetization today.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,700
And frankly this is probably a video that'll get me laughed at by any detractors or hate

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,800
watchers that happen to be around, but I don't care, it's not for them.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,920
It's for those people who watch me and like me and care about me and find the things that

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,480
I have to say interesting.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,080
It's for those people that I say I love to at the end of not every but most of my videos.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,560
So here it is, we can talk about it.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,720
Your channel is no longer eligible to monetize.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,040
This is not just taking all the videos and making them have yellow monetization symbols,

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,920
this is I cannot turn on monetization for the entire channel.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
It's all gone.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
The reason is harmful or hateful content.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,880
As always the learn more there link brings you to a very unhelpful page where they tell

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,960
you about their terms of service, but it's purposefully so vague that I have no idea

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
what I did.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,840
I have some idea about what I did, but we'll get to that.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,480
I can reapply on October 31st, 2020.

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,200
And so fair enough, that is a month without getting paid.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
That's not great.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,040
Outside of the normal 30 day wait that this sort of thing happens for, I do happen to

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,440
know people who have an in at YouTube and so they ask what this was about.

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,200
However the report that came back from them was equally vague.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,880
That it was a justified demonetization, not a mistake, for the purposes of harmful or

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
hateful content.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,800
They didn't say what specific video triggered this or what changes I had to make.

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,880
However I was informed that for the first time in my channel's history my stream was

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,760
featured on YouTube's front page.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,840
That was the stream where it was me, Arch, Lilith, and Scrump talking about the Trump

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,000
Biden debate.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,320
And Scrump was drunk, dumb, and said the n-word a few times.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,480
So frankly that was probably it.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,860
Thanks Scrump, I appreciate it.

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,400
So I deleted the video, or the stream, the streambod, it's gone now, and I put up a couple

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,800
videos since the demonetization, and I realized that like, YouTube, YouTube still runs ads

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
on these videos.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,560
I'm just not getting my cut, they just take the whole thing.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,360
And I don't entirely mean to yuri post here, but it is demoralizing.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,560
I consented to YouTube taking a portion of the revenue from my work because they provide

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,080
this service, and I get the rest.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,000
I did not consent to do it for free.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,440
And whenever I made a video, knowing full well that I wouldn't be getting paid for it

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,920
no matter how good the video was or how many hits it got or how many people liked it, um,

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,400
I realized I didn't want to do it, which is why you haven't seen much from me on this

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
channel since the demonetization.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,200
And in case you guys haven't realized, um, I'm a real pussy, I don't know if you've noticed.

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,040
Like, I've lost friends to Trump Derangement Syndrome, and I've had to, you know, talk

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
about it a bit and be sad for a few days.

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,180
I've been maligned and misrepresented and ignored by people that I thought I was on

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,280
good terms with, I've been backstabbed and betrayed, I've had to deal with toxic people

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,560
from a variety of different communities, saying shit about me, making videos about me, writing

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,200
articles about me, and I can't pretend that I simply shrugged it off and went on with

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
my day.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,280
Every time it happened, I had to stop for a bit.

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,880
Sometimes just an hour, sometimes an afternoon.

56
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Not too long.

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,020
It's not like I was devastated for years and needed to save space, but I had to sit down

58
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:42,580
for a minute because generally when I interact with somebody, I assume that we're friends

59
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
until we're not.

60
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,000
I think it's a healthy way to do things because I want to invite the best parts of other people

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,680
forward and not the worst parts when we're interacting.

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,600
And that's not a process that I intend to stop.

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,240
But it has made it harder for me to deal with things when something goes wrong or something

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
falls through.

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,480
I don't think I'm capable of just shrugging it off.

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Some people can.

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
Some people can be told that something bad has happened and here's what they have to

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,300
do and they can go off and do it.

69
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,320
I'm the type that has to sit there for a while and think about it, I think.

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,720
I got the first word back from that backdoor appeal this morning and it pretty much took

71
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
my afternoon out from under me.

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,320
I didn't seem to be capable of doing any real work.

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,280
I didn't seem to be capable of even having a positive attitude.

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,320
I just didn't want to do anything because it felt entirely hopeless.

75
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Let's be honest, guys.

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,500
It's not hopeless, but I'm in a bad situation right now for sure.

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
This is not nothing.

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,200
And I'm not going to pretend that I'm completely feeling better.

79
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,800
The outlook is just as bleak as it was when I first found out about the news.

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,640
My chances of getting re-monetized are the exact same, but I guess before I can actually

81
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,840
get back to work, I just need to sit around and suffer for a little bit.

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,980
Maybe that's just my personality type, you know?

83
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,980
That probably makes me weak.

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,800
In any case, what's actually happening is I'm going through that backdoor again with

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
some modifications to the channel.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,760
I changed a few of the spicier titles and thumbnails in the backlog.

87
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,880
I removed the offending stream where Scrump said his gamer words.

88
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,760
However, if they still come back and say no, there's still hate speech, I don't know what

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
to do.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,600
I can wait it out for 30 days and do the normal appeals process, but there's no guarantee

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,800
I can come back.

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,720
I can ask the people that helped Dankula, because I know that he was demonetized for

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
years and he got it back.

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
But again, there's no guarantee that'll help either.

95
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
And really, the hardest part is the waiting.

96
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,440
If I was told that I'm just fucked, and there's no more monetization on this channel and it's

97
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,280
never coming back, I'd be like, okay, I'll start a new channel.

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll just start a new channel right now.

99
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Fuck it, you know?

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
We'll move on.

101
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
We'll do something else.

102
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
I know we have 90,000 subs here.

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,640
I know that probably, at best, one third of you would follow me over to the new one.

104
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
But you know what?

105
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
We'll rebuild.

106
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:00,520
But right now, until I get the word, it feels like a waste of time to put energy into a

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,260
channel that I might not even use.

108
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:11,680
That being said, I did reserve what I thought was a pretty funny name for it in Devonatized,

109
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,940
because why the fuck not, right?

110
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,520
So if I do have to move somewhere, it'll probably be here.

111
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,860
The whole short, fat otaku name came from 2009, where my friends and I made anime reviews.

112
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:30,140
Like that guy with the glasses, channel awesome, AVGN-styled reviews from that era of the internet.

113
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,340
And ever since I started doing political content on it, the name really never fit, did it?

114
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,060
I still like to watch anime sometimes, but that's not the focus of the channel anymore.

115
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,240
And my name is Dev, so Devonatized seems like it's a pretty good name.

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,560
So please consider subbing to that channel, I mean if we get a few thousand there I'll

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,520
probably use it for something anyway, because why not?

118
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,880
But I might end up needing to do a political analysis over there, if the re-monetization

119
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,080
efforts don't come through.

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,320
And of course, as always, there's ways to support the channel in the description of

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,140
this video and every other video, so if you feel like the content that I make, or made,

122
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,800
but I'll still make it somewhere, is worth your time and your money, then you can donate

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
there.

124
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,600
I will support this channel in the meantime, because that's the question, isn't it?

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,120
Like I said, I don't want to make videos, I just don't.

126
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,800
Not while YouTube's running ads on them and I'm not getting paid.

127
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,120
I will not support that kind of theft of my labour.

128
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,720
So I might just start streaming on the channel.

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,260
It might be a case where I simply run Streamlabs and stream every day, and we talk about the

130
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,660
news and we kind of go over some funny things maybe, and then at the end of the day, I take

131
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,160
the stream down.

132
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,680
Because again, I will not have YouTube run ads on any of my content unless I am making

133
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,980
at least part of the money for those ads.

134
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,520
So until this is settled, I think I'll be streaming.

135
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,920
I think that's the plan.

136
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,960
I know there are some of you who subbed who did not sign up for this.

137
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,520
You like the scripted videos, you like the pre-recorded videos, you're not here for a

138
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
stream.

139
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
I understand.

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,060
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,520
But it doesn't feel right for me to make videos and not get paid for them.

142
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,320
And I don't want to do the shilling thing.

143
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,280
I don't want to do the Raid Shadow Legends thing.

144
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
That's not for me.

145
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,920
I always told myself I wouldn't do that and I won't do it now.

146
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,640
I am not going to hawk a product at you that I don't use myself.

147
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,040
And most of these products I don't use myself.

148
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,880
So until monetization comes back, this will be a streaming channel.

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,720
And if it does come back, then things will go back to normal.

150
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
I hope you're not too disappointed.

151
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,280
I hope you won't leave over this.

152
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,480
And thank you very much for sticking through this with me.

153
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,240
I really do appreciate it.

154
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,740
I love you.
