WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.640
Haha, hey look at that, SFO classic.

00:11.640 --> 00:16.120
Well we're talking about my demonetization today.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.700
And frankly this is probably a video that'll get me laughed at by any detractors or hate

00:20.700 --> 00:24.800
watchers that happen to be around, but I don't care, it's not for them.

00:24.800 --> 00:29.920
It's for those people who watch me and like me and care about me and find the things that

00:29.920 --> 00:31.480
I have to say interesting.

00:31.480 --> 00:37.080
It's for those people that I say I love to at the end of not every but most of my videos.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.560
So here it is, we can talk about it.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.720
Your channel is no longer eligible to monetize.

00:41.720 --> 00:46.040
This is not just taking all the videos and making them have yellow monetization symbols,

00:46.040 --> 00:48.920
this is I cannot turn on monetization for the entire channel.

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
It's all gone.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.480
The reason is harmful or hateful content.

00:52.480 --> 00:59.880
As always the learn more there link brings you to a very unhelpful page where they tell

00:59.880 --> 01:04.960
you about their terms of service, but it's purposefully so vague that I have no idea

01:04.960 --> 01:05.960
what I did.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.840
I have some idea about what I did, but we'll get to that.

01:08.840 --> 01:11.480
I can reapply on October 31st, 2020.

01:11.480 --> 01:15.200
And so fair enough, that is a month without getting paid.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
That's not great.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.040
Outside of the normal 30 day wait that this sort of thing happens for, I do happen to

01:20.040 --> 01:24.440
know people who have an in at YouTube and so they ask what this was about.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.200
However the report that came back from them was equally vague.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.880
That it was a justified demonetization, not a mistake, for the purposes of harmful or

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
hateful content.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.800
They didn't say what specific video triggered this or what changes I had to make.

01:37.800 --> 01:43.880
However I was informed that for the first time in my channel's history my stream was

01:43.880 --> 01:45.760
featured on YouTube's front page.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.840
That was the stream where it was me, Arch, Lilith, and Scrump talking about the Trump

01:49.840 --> 01:51.000
Biden debate.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.320
And Scrump was drunk, dumb, and said the n-word a few times.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.480
So frankly that was probably it.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.860
Thanks Scrump, I appreciate it.

01:59.860 --> 02:04.400
So I deleted the video, or the stream, the streambod, it's gone now, and I put up a couple

02:04.400 --> 02:12.800
videos since the demonetization, and I realized that like, YouTube, YouTube still runs ads

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
on these videos.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.560
I'm just not getting my cut, they just take the whole thing.

02:17.560 --> 02:22.360
And I don't entirely mean to yuri post here, but it is demoralizing.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.560
I consented to YouTube taking a portion of the revenue from my work because they provide

02:26.560 --> 02:29.080
this service, and I get the rest.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.000
I did not consent to do it for free.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.440
And whenever I made a video, knowing full well that I wouldn't be getting paid for it

02:35.440 --> 02:40.920
no matter how good the video was or how many hits it got or how many people liked it, um,

02:40.920 --> 02:45.400
I realized I didn't want to do it, which is why you haven't seen much from me on this

02:45.400 --> 02:47.400
channel since the demonetization.

02:47.400 --> 02:55.200
And in case you guys haven't realized, um, I'm a real pussy, I don't know if you've noticed.

02:55.200 --> 03:01.040
Like, I've lost friends to Trump Derangement Syndrome, and I've had to, you know, talk

03:01.040 --> 03:03.440
about it a bit and be sad for a few days.

03:03.440 --> 03:08.180
I've been maligned and misrepresented and ignored by people that I thought I was on

03:08.180 --> 03:12.280
good terms with, I've been backstabbed and betrayed, I've had to deal with toxic people

03:12.280 --> 03:17.560
from a variety of different communities, saying shit about me, making videos about me, writing

03:17.560 --> 03:22.200
articles about me, and I can't pretend that I simply shrugged it off and went on with

03:22.200 --> 03:23.200
my day.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.280
Every time it happened, I had to stop for a bit.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.880
Sometimes just an hour, sometimes an afternoon.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.880
Not too long.

03:29.880 --> 03:34.020
It's not like I was devastated for years and needed to save space, but I had to sit down

03:34.020 --> 03:42.580
for a minute because generally when I interact with somebody, I assume that we're friends

03:42.580 --> 03:43.580
until we're not.

03:43.580 --> 03:49.000
I think it's a healthy way to do things because I want to invite the best parts of other people

03:49.000 --> 03:52.680
forward and not the worst parts when we're interacting.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.600
And that's not a process that I intend to stop.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.240
But it has made it harder for me to deal with things when something goes wrong or something

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
falls through.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.480
I don't think I'm capable of just shrugging it off.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.480
Some people can.

04:04.480 --> 04:08.000
Some people can be told that something bad has happened and here's what they have to

04:08.000 --> 04:09.300
do and they can go off and do it.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.320
I'm the type that has to sit there for a while and think about it, I think.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.720
I got the first word back from that backdoor appeal this morning and it pretty much took

04:18.720 --> 04:20.360
my afternoon out from under me.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.320
I didn't seem to be capable of doing any real work.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.280
I didn't seem to be capable of even having a positive attitude.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.320
I just didn't want to do anything because it felt entirely hopeless.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.320
Let's be honest, guys.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.500
It's not hopeless, but I'm in a bad situation right now for sure.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
This is not nothing.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.200
And I'm not going to pretend that I'm completely feeling better.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.800
The outlook is just as bleak as it was when I first found out about the news.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.640
My chances of getting re-monetized are the exact same, but I guess before I can actually

04:47.640 --> 04:50.840
get back to work, I just need to sit around and suffer for a little bit.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.980
Maybe that's just my personality type, you know?

04:52.980 --> 04:53.980
That probably makes me weak.

04:53.980 --> 04:58.800
In any case, what's actually happening is I'm going through that backdoor again with

04:58.800 --> 05:01.000
some modifications to the channel.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.760
I changed a few of the spicier titles and thumbnails in the backlog.

05:03.760 --> 05:08.880
I removed the offending stream where Scrump said his gamer words.

05:08.880 --> 05:14.760
However, if they still come back and say no, there's still hate speech, I don't know what

05:14.760 --> 05:15.880
to do.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.600
I can wait it out for 30 days and do the normal appeals process, but there's no guarantee

05:19.600 --> 05:21.800
I can come back.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.720
I can ask the people that helped Dankula, because I know that he was demonetized for

05:25.720 --> 05:28.720
years and he got it back.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.280
But again, there's no guarantee that'll help either.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.280
And really, the hardest part is the waiting.

05:33.280 --> 05:38.440
If I was told that I'm just fucked, and there's no more monetization on this channel and it's

05:38.440 --> 05:41.280
never coming back, I'd be like, okay, I'll start a new channel.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.640
I'll just start a new channel right now.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.640
Fuck it, you know?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.640
We'll move on.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.640
We'll do something else.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.880
I know we have 90,000 subs here.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.640
I know that probably, at best, one third of you would follow me over to the new one.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.640
But you know what?

05:52.640 --> 05:53.640
We'll rebuild.

05:53.640 --> 06:00.520
But right now, until I get the word, it feels like a waste of time to put energy into a

06:00.520 --> 06:03.260
channel that I might not even use.

06:03.260 --> 06:11.680
That being said, I did reserve what I thought was a pretty funny name for it in Devonatized,

06:11.680 --> 06:13.940
because why the fuck not, right?

06:13.940 --> 06:17.520
So if I do have to move somewhere, it'll probably be here.

06:17.520 --> 06:23.860
The whole short, fat otaku name came from 2009, where my friends and I made anime reviews.

06:23.860 --> 06:30.140
Like that guy with the glasses, channel awesome, AVGN-styled reviews from that era of the internet.

06:30.140 --> 06:34.340
And ever since I started doing political content on it, the name really never fit, did it?

06:34.340 --> 06:38.060
I still like to watch anime sometimes, but that's not the focus of the channel anymore.

06:38.060 --> 06:42.240
And my name is Dev, so Devonatized seems like it's a pretty good name.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.560
So please consider subbing to that channel, I mean if we get a few thousand there I'll

06:45.560 --> 06:48.520
probably use it for something anyway, because why not?

06:48.520 --> 06:53.880
But I might end up needing to do a political analysis over there, if the re-monetization

06:53.880 --> 06:56.080
efforts don't come through.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.320
And of course, as always, there's ways to support the channel in the description of

06:59.320 --> 07:04.140
this video and every other video, so if you feel like the content that I make, or made,

07:04.140 --> 07:08.800
but I'll still make it somewhere, is worth your time and your money, then you can donate

07:08.800 --> 07:09.800
there.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.600
I will support this channel in the meantime, because that's the question, isn't it?

07:13.600 --> 07:17.120
Like I said, I don't want to make videos, I just don't.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.800
Not while YouTube's running ads on them and I'm not getting paid.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.120
I will not support that kind of theft of my labour.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.720
So I might just start streaming on the channel.

07:25.720 --> 07:32.260
It might be a case where I simply run Streamlabs and stream every day, and we talk about the

07:32.260 --> 07:36.660
news and we kind of go over some funny things maybe, and then at the end of the day, I take

07:36.660 --> 07:38.160
the stream down.

07:38.160 --> 07:44.680
Because again, I will not have YouTube run ads on any of my content unless I am making

07:44.680 --> 07:46.980
at least part of the money for those ads.

07:46.980 --> 07:50.520
So until this is settled, I think I'll be streaming.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.920
I think that's the plan.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.960
I know there are some of you who subbed who did not sign up for this.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.520
You like the scripted videos, you like the pre-recorded videos, you're not here for a

07:59.520 --> 08:00.520
stream.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.520
I understand.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.060
I'm sorry.

08:03.060 --> 08:07.520
But it doesn't feel right for me to make videos and not get paid for them.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.320
And I don't want to do the shilling thing.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.280
I don't want to do the Raid Shadow Legends thing.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.280
That's not for me.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.920
I always told myself I wouldn't do that and I won't do it now.

08:14.920 --> 08:20.640
I am not going to hawk a product at you that I don't use myself.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.040
And most of these products I don't use myself.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.880
So until monetization comes back, this will be a streaming channel.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.720
And if it does come back, then things will go back to normal.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.880
I hope you're not too disappointed.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.280
I hope you won't leave over this.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.480
And thank you very much for sticking through this with me.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.240
I really do appreciate it.

08:40.240 --> 08:40.740
I love you.
