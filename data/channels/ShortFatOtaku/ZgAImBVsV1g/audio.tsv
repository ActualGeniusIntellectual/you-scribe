0	9160	Hello friends, I'm recording this Sunday morning.
9160	13560	And in case you're wondering, yes, this is why the weekly sip is late.
13560	17920	I've got to do this right now because I have a feeling another Twitter ban is imminent.
17920	21340	So I got to get this done before all the evidence disappears.
21340	22800	I put out this tweet.
22800	27920	In a future where gender dysphoria is cured by taking a pill to alleviate symptoms, transitioning
27920	31840	will likely be viewed the same way other outdated treatments are.
31840	35600	You can do it, but the people peddling it are quacks, and you will be looked at funny
35600	37640	for not taking the obvious cure.
37640	42760	This isn't exactly my most viral tweet ever, I've had many more things go way more viral
42760	48160	than this, but the amount of insane vitriol that this unearthed is pretty extreme.
48160	51840	And I want to laugh at some of the retards that have decided to show up here, but also
51840	54160	discuss the idea more seriously as well.
54160	59000	Now most people who angrily came into my mentions pointed out that a pill to alleviate symptoms
59000	61240	is literally HRT, which is true.
61240	65060	Not all forms of HRT are injected, some of them you actually take them as pills.
65060	69120	But of course I always quickly clarify, I'm talking about a pill that makes you comfortable
69120	70600	as your birth sex.
70600	76540	So as the analogy goes, HRT moves your body to be more in line with your brain, I'm talking
76540	79600	about moving your brain to be more in line with your body.
79600	83400	Now a good chunk of them just blocked me after I said that because they just found that inherently
83400	84400	immoral and offensive.
84400	88840	But there doesn't seem to be much of a reason as to why that's immoral or offensive.
88840	92740	But these people are doing the reverse Uno thing, and honestly that was just most people.
92740	95560	I can appreciate the wittiness, but it's clearly not what I'm talking about.
95560	99840	A lot of people claim that I've never spoken to a trans person before or that I don't have
99840	104120	any trans people in my life, if only, if only they knew.
104120	105980	Oh, this one made the opposite claim.
105980	110680	I'm not somebody who knows zero trans women, I'm a chaser of trans women.
110840	115600	I hate to burst your bubble, but I don't need to chase them, they tend to come to me.
115600	119300	In my experience, it's generally hard for progressives to understand that people can
119300	122160	have a different idea than them that doesn't stem out of ignorance.
122160	126280	No, I know many trans people, and a lot of them even agree with me here.
126280	130200	Oftentimes the conversation will go to a place where they say something like, there's nothing
130200	133200	wrong with trans people's brains, only yours.
133200	136800	The meaning behind it being that trans people actually have nothing wrong with them.
136800	139940	And it's like, well, no, that's not true.
139940	142760	Gender dysphoria is a mental illness.
142760	144420	Transitioning is the treatment for that illness.
144420	148820	If there's nothing wrong with the trans person's brain, what are they treating with the hormones
148820	149820	then?
149820	153460	If you provided me with a pill that suppressed gender dysphoria, it would only stimulate
153460	157340	me to further and more boldly explore my femininity through transsexuality.
157340	160800	The pill that you hope would eradicate me would make me into more of a tranny.
160800	161800	You lose.
161800	166120	Well, I don't care about eradicating you, and I don't care whether or not you're a tranny.
166120	168840	But this doesn't sound like it's a cure for dysphoria.
168840	170800	This now sounds like a fetish.
170800	173040	And in fact, this person basically admits it.
173040	176600	Gender dysphoria isn't what makes me trans lol, it's what prevents me from being as feminine
176600	177600	as I probably could.
177600	180620	It is the limit that sad passions set to what my body can do.
180620	182400	This is a hill that I'm going to die on.
182400	188920	If you have gender dysphoria or you have transitioned and the transitioning has successfully treated
188920	192720	the gender dysphoria such that you no longer have it, but if you went off the transitioning,
192720	193720	it would come back.
193720	194960	That means that you're trans.
194960	199440	If you don't have gender dysphoria and your transitioning does not treat gender dysphoria,
199440	200440	then you're not trans.
200440	204040	You're an HRT femboy pursuing an aesthetic.
204040	205040	And you do you.
205040	206040	That's your right.
206040	208560	But dysphoria has to be part of the equation to make you trans.
208560	210820	Again, that's why transitioning is medical treatment.
210820	212160	You're treating a mental illness.
212160	213160	Dysphoria.
213160	216960	Without the mental illness, it's not a treatment anymore, and you just want to be a trap.
216960	220680	And sometimes just the best nonsense falls into your lap.
220680	222800	Me whenever I talk to a real person in the real world.
222800	228640	Why do cis men with horrible LGBT takes always have the worst and most annoying profile pictures?
228640	230520	Well, that was actually that was purposeful.
230520	234180	I wanted it to be annoying to this person because they have zero to three commissions
234180	235400	currently occupied.
235400	238400	I just asked for a commission of a happy, successful conversion therapy patient.
238400	241800	At this point, I just didn't care about these morons anymore, bro.
241800	245320	Just say you hate queer people and leave this devil's advocate.
245320	249440	What if type of mentality is just as harmful as people trying to eradicate trans people
249440	250440	directly?
250440	251440	Fuck off.
252440	253600	Here's the deal.
253600	255960	I want this guy killed clean shot.
255960	261600	Who's this homo posting revisionist Marxist read Sartre Sartre.
261600	265240	Wasn't he one of the French intellectuals who wanted the age of consent abolished?
265240	268660	Of course, sometimes these people are just fucking insane.
268660	273960	I would have no moral issue with sharp objects dancing very close to your windpipe.
273960	275520	Look at this guy's bio, dude.
275520	280800	Perma regressed ever child before Joe gamine children's card game appreciator.
281160	284920	Our minds are very young, six, 10, 12, and 16.
284920	285920	Please be nice.
285920	289520	So this person claims to have multiple personalities, all very under age.
289520	293160	I guarantee you this person is just a 45 year old man.
293160	294280	Check this person out.
294280	298240	We have no compassion and ask no compassion from you.
298240	302260	When our turn comes, we will not make excuses for the terror.
302260	305400	It's always great when they just go mask off and like they don't, they don't even pretend
305400	309880	that it's about the arguments anymore or even that it's about transphobia anymore.
309880	310880	They just want to hurt you.
310880	311880	That's it.
311880	315320	However, of course, this person is a fucking permanently online loser.
315320	316600	There will be no terror.
316600	321220	They experience enough terror trying to order Chinese food over the phone because the local
321220	324640	rat soup shop doesn't have an online portal like Domino's.
324640	326720	They are never going to do anything in real life.
326720	329600	Okay, here's an actual argument from Euphoria Tori.
329600	332920	She says any type of pill like this would erase who I am.
332920	334600	I wouldn't be me anymore.
334600	336260	I'd rather die than live like that.
336260	338160	And she's actually engaging with hypothetical.
338160	340660	The idea is, okay, we have a pill.
340660	346440	Rather than put you on HRT and feminize your body to match your, for lack of better term,
346440	347440	feminine brain.
347440	349640	I know that's not quite accurate, but you know what I'm talking about.
349640	353920	Instead of feminizing the body to match the brain, what we could do is change the brain
353920	355360	to match the body.
355360	356600	That's what this hypothetical is getting at.
356600	357600	I'm not saying it's possible.
357600	361280	I don't think it's currently possible, but if it were, would it be a good treatment?
361280	364880	And Euphoria Tori says, no, it would not be a good treatment because that would be erasing
364880	366340	their current personality.
366340	370400	Personally, I don't think that argument holds up because your current personality is being
370400	371980	erased all the time.
371980	375700	As you move through different phases of your life, you're shedding old identities and picking
375700	376700	up new ones.
376700	378940	You're not the person that you were five, 10, 20 years ago.
378940	380260	That doesn't mean that that person died.
380260	381820	It doesn't mean that they were erased.
381820	384220	In fact, it means they transitioned.
384220	387180	You transition from child to teenager to adult.
387180	390620	You transition in and out of various physical and mental problems.
390620	393300	You transition between relationships and jobs.
393300	396980	These are all deaths of an identity, but it doesn't constitute the death of yourself,
396980	398060	and you wouldn't even say that.
398060	401860	You are a different person, but the previous person that you were didn't die.
401860	403260	They changed into you.
403260	406580	There is a continuity between the various selves of your past.
406580	408940	Several other people use the identity death logic in this conversation.
408940	414460	Euphoria Tori was just probably the most well-spoken one, but I don't think the logic tracks.
414460	418500	Some people began to say that taking a pill to alter your personality that drastically,
418500	422580	like Euphoria Tori said, was inherently immoral, like this person here.
422580	423580	Take it further.
423580	425860	A pill that just makes you accept whatever circumstances you're in.
425860	426860	Consumed by grief?
426860	427860	Pill.
427860	428860	You get racial discrimination for your skin color?
428860	429860	Pill.
429860	430860	You are angry at your work conditions?
430860	431860	Politics?
431860	432860	Inequality?
432860	433860	Pill.
433860	435860	The issue ultimately is this person is also describing HRT.
435860	439060	HRT doesn't only change your body, it also has mental effects.
439060	444100	She's saying it's this grave sin to alter your mind with a pill, but HRT also does this.
444100	447600	Hell, a lot of recreational drugs that progressives want legalized also do this.
447600	451380	The only difference that I can see is that my hypothetical is a one-time pill that leaves
451380	452380	a permanent change.
452380	456220	Okay, if that bugs you, what if the hypothetical treatment alleviated dysphoria, but it didn't
456220	458860	transition you, and you had to keep taking it like HRT?
458860	459860	Would it be immoral?
459860	462020	I don't think so, but I'm not sure progressives would agree.
462020	464680	In fact, at one point somebody brought up transhumanism.
464680	468300	The idea that in the future we'll be doing more extensive edits to our bodies and minds
468300	472660	using advanced technology, and both a dysphoria treatment to bring body in line with brain
472660	476180	and brain in line with body, sounds like transhumanism to me.
476180	478340	But these people didn't like that.
478340	481500	Transhumanism is the freedom to completely self-realize, not the freedom to change someone
481500	482540	else's self.
482540	484020	This person's a pure Utopian.
484020	486440	They don't think that future technology will be used against them.
486440	489940	So I'm assuming that in your perfect world we would have cured autism too?
489940	491900	Um, yes.
491900	494980	You have the most boring idea of transhumanism possible.
494980	498360	Instead of expanding the possibilities of how we can live our lives, trying to keeping
498360	500060	as narrow and intricate as possible.
500060	504660	Listen, modernity has brought some great expansions of possibilities regarding how we can choose
504660	505660	to live our lives.
505660	508660	For example, I can do something now that I couldn't do 50 years ago.
508660	512700	I can go and do as much fentanyl as I want until I die on the street.
512700	514740	That's a possibility that modernity has brought to me.
514740	515740	But you know what?
515740	519620	The reason that things are narrow and restricted sometimes is because that's good.
519620	522620	They ultimately didn't have a transhumanist-based argument either.
522620	526220	They simply said, our type of body edits are expanding humanity while yours are eugenics.
526220	527420	And that's not an argument.
527420	530040	That's just more bad thing bad baby logic.
530040	534800	One of the most revolting things about transphobic narratives is the sick, self-satisfied glee
534800	538420	these people manage to extract from fantasizing about a world where trans people no longer
538420	539420	exist.
539420	543460	This is the transgenocide argument, where the idea is a future where there is no more
543460	545660	trans people means that trans people have been genocided.
545660	546980	I don't think that's true.
546980	551280	I know, for example, I think Vosch believes, and some other people too believe, they believe
551280	557380	that certain hormone imbalances, or I don't know, hormonal events, I don't fucking know,
557380	561560	that happened to the child from the mother while the mother's pregnant is the hypothesis
561560	563940	for causing gender dysphoria at birth.
563940	568020	Okay, let's assume that's the case, just for hypothetical sake.
568020	574120	If we gave all mothers certain pills or shots or whatever that prevented what Vosch calls
574120	578420	these hormone washes, and that made it so that there was no more gender dysphoria, is
578420	579420	that a transgenocide?
579420	583860	There's no more trans people, but there's also no more people suffering from a horrific
583860	584860	mental illness.
584860	590300	On some level, there seems to be two forces within the trans conversation that are directly
590300	595060	at odds, treating gender dysphoria and the continuation of trans people as a political
595060	596060	block.
596100	600760	Because if we cured cancer, for example, there would definitely be a cancer patient genocide
600760	602460	and that there would be no more cancer patients.
602460	603780	That would be good.
603780	607780	And in fact, with some of these people, I think they've blocked me, I've got to find
607780	608780	it.
608780	610180	Here we go, I found it finally.
610180	614320	Where does treating pregnant women to ensure nobody is born with gender dysphoria anymore
614320	616660	come into the UN's definition of genocide?
616660	621460	Deliberate targeting of a group, trans people, with the intent of making them not exist anymore.
621460	626620	Some people literally just will outright say it, that a cure for gender dysphoria that
626620	631340	makes it so that people who would have been trans are no longer trans, that's genocide.
631340	634940	And that it's more important that the trans identity, that the trans group, the political
634940	640160	unit, continue forward into the future than it is actually helping cure those people,
640160	641820	in a hypothetical where such a cure existed.
641820	647340	It seems to be the case that to progressives, trans people are just a political pawn.
647340	651660	In fact, this entire conversation is about isolating first principles, although many
651660	653360	of these people just didn't understand this.
653360	658380	I prefer the future, where boring cis dudes shut the fuck up about their hypothetical
658380	663400	magic pill and realize, do you know what a hypothetical is, is not a valid argument.
663400	666020	This person doesn't understand what the point of hypotheticals is.
666020	669620	In fact, in my experience, a lot of people don't understand what the point of a hypothetical
669620	670620	is.
670620	671940	The idea is to get at first principles.
671940	675240	A first principle is when you isolate what's really wrong with a thing.
675240	677480	Most people genuinely don't understand how this works.
677480	680840	I saw a debate Destiny had with an anti-sex work feminist, for example, where she just
680840	681840	didn't get it.
681840	685580	But in order for us to get to the first principles, we first have to discuss what's at the core
685580	687240	of this conversation.
687240	691420	We all agree conversion therapy is immoral, but to understand why it's immoral, we need
691420	695060	to write down all of the reasons that it is and then start knocking them away one by one
695060	697800	to see which pillar is actually holding the thing up.
697800	701760	So as far as I can tell, all of the possible arguments for why conversion therapy is immoral
701760	706440	are because, one, it's extremely painful, two, it doesn't work, three, it's generally
706440	710780	nonconsensual, and four, it implies that there should be less gay or trans people.
710780	712380	So let's start knocking the legs out.
712380	713380	It's extremely painful.
713380	714480	This isn't an argument.
714480	715660	Other medical treatments are painful.
715660	717240	We still use them if they work.
717240	719200	Chemo is painful and we do it because it works.
719200	720200	So does it work?
720200	721200	No.
721200	722840	So conversion therapy is immoral because it doesn't work.
722840	723840	Okay.
723840	724840	What if it did work?
724840	725840	Is it consensual?
725840	726840	No.
726840	730120	So even a working conversion therapy would be immoral if it was always nonconsensual.
730120	731120	Okay.
732120	734040	Should there be less gay or trans people?
734040	735740	My answer to this is it doesn't matter.
735740	737960	For a liberal, this is a value neutral answer.
737960	742740	A room of 100 gay people and zero straight people has the same moral value as a room
742740	745220	full of 100 straight people and zero gay people.
745220	746220	No more and no less.
746220	748180	So this question doesn't actually matter.
748180	751780	What this means is from a liberal point of view, we've isolated what makes conversion
751780	756100	therapy immoral by stripping away the pieces of it until it does become moral in our eyes.
756100	760060	The arguments it's painful and it implies there should be less gay or trans people contribute
760060	762380	no moral content to conversion therapy.
762380	766900	The arguments it doesn't work and it's nonconsensual do contribute moral content to conversion
766900	767900	therapy.
767900	771360	Therefore, conversion therapy is immoral because it doesn't work and it's nonconsensual.
771360	775620	And also, if conversion therapy worked and was consented to, it would not be immoral.
775620	777500	But the trans activist couldn't accept this.
777500	782140	To them, it would still be immoral even if it worked and even if people consented because
782140	786620	to them, extra moral content lies elsewhere in conversion therapy.
786620	787620	Let's find it.
787620	789540	I made this follow-up post.
790540	793380	Yes, this would be a form of conversion therapy.
793380	796840	What makes conversion therapy immoral is that it doesn't work.
796840	800780	If conversion therapy worked, then there would be no moral issue with it.
800780	804060	This is an argument that I haven't seen anyone here actually have a good reply to.
804060	805220	Because it seems to be true.
805220	809820	Sam Brinton, for example, ended up being a complete and total liar about his conversion
809820	811320	therapy experience.
811320	816380	But the experience he described in that video was one that was commonly used just, you know,
816380	818800	several decades before Sam Brinton was born.
818800	821480	This is the face of a person who hates a spectrum of human expression and wants to
821480	822480	squash all uniqueness.
822480	824880	Dude, do you have an argument or not?
824880	826320	No, that's not what makes it immoral.
826320	831060	It is the fact that conversion therapy tries to take all already marginalized people and
831060	834200	try to break them into fit the box society demands that they slot into.
834200	835880	You're not engaging with the hypothetical.
835880	837780	If they choose it, what's the problem?
837780	840640	This is what I mean when I talk about approaching first principles.
840640	843000	What is it that makes conversion therapy immoral?
843000	846520	Whether it works has never been the basis on which its morality is judged and ever will
846520	847520	be.
847520	848720	It's opposite day in your skull.
848720	852560	We could edit people to not be black anymore, so nobody has to deal with racism.
852560	854040	Is that fine to you?
854040	857060	No, we should change society to not be racist.
857060	858060	Black is a skin color.
858060	861000	It's not a set of behaviors and it's certainly not a mental illness.
861000	862000	It's not the same thing.
862000	863760	That's not a comparable conversation.
863760	866240	Least genocidal Libra.
866240	870520	This person probably thinks that my existence is genocide because the bloodline of my non-white
870520	873440	ancestors are now part of a white passing genome.
873440	877560	Getting real sick of genocidal freaks like this, treating our lives and bodies like the
877560	879320	quirky little thought experiment.
879320	881360	Is that why you're called the dying Hawaiian?
881360	883960	What makes ethnic cleansing immoral is that it doesn't work.
883960	886360	If it worked, there would be no moral issue with it.
886360	889200	No, because that involves killing people, you moron.
889200	894560	And look, there's just people who are morally outraged, but they have no argument.
894560	898460	Oh fuck, it's not cursed E. What a f- this fucking moron.
898460	901280	This person's blocked me on like six or seven different Twitter accounts, by the way.
901280	902960	I guess I'm not blocked on this one yet.
902960	905640	This is a wild misunderstanding of what makes conversion therapy immoral.
905640	908200	And I'm not surprised to see if only a transgender cure postal them out.
908200	909200	Well, let's see.
909200	910200	What's her argument?
910200	913760	Conversion practices often involve horrific methods, but even if they didn't and you
913760	916920	had a hundred percent safe way of achieving it, the fact that you desire changing someone
916920	921360	from being LGBTQIA plus at all is bad when you can just leave them alone and stop being
921360	922360	a fucking bigot.
922360	923360	Here's the thing.
923360	924360	I don't desire it.
924360	925360	I don't care.
925360	926880	What's actually going on here is that unlike a liberal, the progressives see that fourth
926880	927880	argument.
927880	929400	Should there be less gay or trans people?
929400	930400	Not as value neutral.
930400	932640	They don't think the answer to that question is who cares.
932640	938180	For them, more LGBTQIA plus people is a priority good and less is bad, which means that any
938180	942340	hypothetical treatment for dysphoria that results in people not transitioning is inherently
942340	943340	immoral.
943340	946680	It's part of the trans genocide, even if no one's actually dying because the political
946680	951300	concept of transness is not being carried forward into the next generation.
951300	955760	This doesn't work because the arc of trans liberation is dual tracked, increasing respect
955760	959820	for liberty based bodily autonomy and increased access to medical care for gender dysphoria
959820	961140	are complimentary.
961140	963180	Far in the future, the latter is no issue.
963180	964180	They're still the former.
964180	967140	Now, of course, they're never going to talk about liberty based bodily autonomy when it
967140	971180	comes to vaccines, but that's not because it was ever about bodily liberty or autonomy.
971180	973940	It's only about the expansion of the trans political block.
973940	977580	Now, some people call being assimilationist, both in terms of a side conversation that
977580	981460	happened regarding ethnicity, but also in terms of the trans question itself, because
981460	985500	there are trans separatists who don't want to actually conform to any sort of normative
985500	986500	notion of gender.
986500	990360	And then there are trans assimilationists who want to pass and stealth and simply be
990360	993840	treated as the gender as they appear to the people around them.
993840	998440	And in the most extreme trans activist camps, the trans assimilationists, the ones who want
998440	1002360	to pass and stealth, they're problematic.
1002360	1007280	They're problematic because their act of passing upholds the cis heteronormative capitalist
1007280	1008280	patriarchy.
1008280	1013120	They could choose to actively deconstruct these limitations, but instead they're choosing
1013120	1014920	to support them by blending in.
1014920	1019160	I don't know about you, but I personally think assimilation into liberal culture is pretty
1019160	1020160	based.
1020960	1024600	But I do know in terms of ethnicity, I'm happy that I live in a modern society with internet
1024600	1028480	and video games and heating and food and I'm not living in a fucking teepee.
1028480	1032320	At the end of the day, these people have very messed up relationships with conversion therapy.
1032320	1034560	It's easy if you're a normie to wrap your head around this.
1034560	1037680	If conversion therapy worked and a gay man wanted to be straight, by what rate do you
1037680	1038680	tell him he can't?
1038680	1040640	Any sane person would say, go ahead, it's your life.
1040640	1042680	But these people have no answer to the question.
1042680	1049880	They simply see more LGBTQIA plus whatever people existing as an a priori good, regardless
1049920	1052000	of whether or not that actually makes other people happy.
1052000	1055920	Some people said like kind of limp-wristedly, well we'd ask him why they want that, because
1055920	1060520	it's all part of like internalized homophobia, like hold on, you don't get to interrogate
1060520	1061520	people for their preferences.
1061520	1064320	You don't allow it when they're gay or when they're trans.
1064320	1065680	Why should you allow it here?
1065680	1071080	Oh, because they're wanting to transition away from being gay or trans if possible.
1071080	1077160	And as I said, they view more LGBTQ people existing as an a priori good, independent
1077160	1078760	of the wishes of those actual people.
1078760	1080840	That's why they cannot actually engage with the hypothetical.
1080840	1084240	And I'll probably get banned for it, so hope it was worth it, at least I got a video
1084240	1085240	out of it.
1085240	1087520	Okay, I'm recording this section several days later, sorry the video's late by the
1087520	1091280	way, and Taftage actually clued me into something very smart going on here.
1091280	1094200	Transactivism seems to rapidly switch between two perspectives, and this conversation reveals
1094200	1095200	it.
1095200	1097840	For example, when we talk about trans women in women's sports, the progressive line is
1097840	1100320	trans women should be able to play in sports with cis women.
1100320	1104280	But with the exception of the giga-crazies, they don't actually mean all trans women.
1104280	1107880	They mean trans women who have been on hormones for X number of years to ensure some level
1107880	1108880	of fairness.
1108880	1112000	Whether or not you agree if that can truly be considered fair doesn't actually matter
1112000	1113000	for this conversation.
1113000	1115260	What matters is how the progressives view their own position.
1115260	1119320	The logic is, we should understand that trans people are the unfortunate victims of a horrible
1119320	1122780	mental illness, and that insofar as they can accommodate the fairness of the sport, we
1122780	1126200	should accommodate them by including them in it, and that trans women who do not qualify
1126200	1128860	for that medical cutoff, unfortunately can't compete.
1128860	1132040	This makes trans activism sound like a medical rights lobby, like you'd see for blind people
1132040	1133600	or deaf people or disabled people.
1133600	1137320	However, if we talk about the actual treatments for that medical problem, suddenly the progressive
1137320	1138320	logic switches.
1138320	1141940	It's no longer a medical rights lobby, but now it's a lifestyle lobby like gay rights
1141940	1142940	activism is.
1142940	1147560	Now, attempting to cure or treat the condition is framed like trying to treat being gay,
1147560	1151240	where being gay is value neutral and you're a bigot for thinking that it needs fixing.
1151240	1154160	This is obviously false because hormones are medical treatment for dysphoria.
1154160	1157040	If you don't have dysphoria, then your hormones are cosmetic, not medical.
1157040	1159040	Your transition is cosmetic, not medical.
1159040	1161020	Your identity is cosmetic, not medical.
1161020	1164800	And you should be treated as if you are engaged in a cosmetic project, not a medical one.
1164800	1168440	The trans activists use this motte and bailey to repeatedly switch between the medical rights
1168440	1172200	lobby, give us compassion because we're suffering, and the lifestyle rights lobby, how dare you
1172200	1176080	attack us for having a neutral lifestyle that is just like yours, when really, only one
1176080	1177800	of these two positions can be true.
1177800	1182140	Anyway, that was just an off-the-cuff video on conversion therapy, at least on the shit
1182140	1185140	show surrounding my tweet on conversion therapy.
1185140	1188040	This isn't even my actual analysis of conversion therapy, and you know what?
1188040	1191880	I'm not even pro-conversion therapy in real life, like, it doesn't work.
1191880	1192960	That's why you shouldn't do it.
1192960	1197900	But it really is fun watching all these fucking progs jump all over themselves and shit themselves
1197900	1198900	over literally nothing.
1198900	1200600	Alright guys, I'll see you next time.
1200600	1201100	I love you.
