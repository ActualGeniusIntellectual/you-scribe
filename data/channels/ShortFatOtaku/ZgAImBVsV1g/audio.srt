00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello friends, I'm recording this Sunday morning.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,560
And in case you're wondering, yes, this is why the weekly sip is late.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,920
I've got to do this right now because I have a feeling another Twitter ban is imminent.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,340
So I got to get this done before all the evidence disappears.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,800
I put out this tweet.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,920
In a future where gender dysphoria is cured by taking a pill to alleviate symptoms, transitioning

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will likely be viewed the same way other outdated treatments are.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600
You can do it, but the people peddling it are quacks, and you will be looked at funny

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,640
for not taking the obvious cure.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,760
This isn't exactly my most viral tweet ever, I've had many more things go way more viral

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,160
than this, but the amount of insane vitriol that this unearthed is pretty extreme.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,840
And I want to laugh at some of the retards that have decided to show up here, but also

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
discuss the idea more seriously as well.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,000
Now most people who angrily came into my mentions pointed out that a pill to alleviate symptoms

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,240
is literally HRT, which is true.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,060
Not all forms of HRT are injected, some of them you actually take them as pills.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,120
But of course I always quickly clarify, I'm talking about a pill that makes you comfortable

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,600
as your birth sex.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,540
So as the analogy goes, HRT moves your body to be more in line with your brain, I'm talking

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,600
about moving your brain to be more in line with your body.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Now a good chunk of them just blocked me after I said that because they just found that inherently

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
immoral and offensive.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,840
But there doesn't seem to be much of a reason as to why that's immoral or offensive.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,740
But these people are doing the reverse Uno thing, and honestly that was just most people.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,560
I can appreciate the wittiness, but it's clearly not what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,840
A lot of people claim that I've never spoken to a trans person before or that I don't have

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,120
any trans people in my life, if only, if only they knew.

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,980
Oh, this one made the opposite claim.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm not somebody who knows zero trans women, I'm a chaser of trans women.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,600
I hate to burst your bubble, but I don't need to chase them, they tend to come to me.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,300
In my experience, it's generally hard for progressives to understand that people can

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,160
have a different idea than them that doesn't stem out of ignorance.

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,280
No, I know many trans people, and a lot of them even agree with me here.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,200
Oftentimes the conversation will go to a place where they say something like, there's nothing

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
wrong with trans people's brains, only yours.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
The meaning behind it being that trans people actually have nothing wrong with them.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,940
And it's like, well, no, that's not true.

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,760
Gender dysphoria is a mental illness.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,420
Transitioning is the treatment for that illness.

40
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,820
If there's nothing wrong with the trans person's brain, what are they treating with the hormones

41
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,820
then?

42
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,460
If you provided me with a pill that suppressed gender dysphoria, it would only stimulate

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,340
me to further and more boldly explore my femininity through transsexuality.

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,800
The pill that you hope would eradicate me would make me into more of a tranny.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
You lose.

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,120
Well, I don't care about eradicating you, and I don't care whether or not you're a tranny.

47
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,840
But this doesn't sound like it's a cure for dysphoria.

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,800
This now sounds like a fetish.

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
And in fact, this person basically admits it.

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,600
Gender dysphoria isn't what makes me trans lol, it's what prevents me from being as feminine

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
as I probably could.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,620
It is the limit that sad passions set to what my body can do.

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,400
This is a hill that I'm going to die on.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,920
If you have gender dysphoria or you have transitioned and the transitioning has successfully treated

55
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,720
the gender dysphoria such that you no longer have it, but if you went off the transitioning,

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
it would come back.

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,960
That means that you're trans.

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,440
If you don't have gender dysphoria and your transitioning does not treat gender dysphoria,

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
then you're not trans.

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,040
You're an HRT femboy pursuing an aesthetic.

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
And you do you.

62
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
That's your right.

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,560
But dysphoria has to be part of the equation to make you trans.

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,820
Again, that's why transitioning is medical treatment.

65
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,160
You're treating a mental illness.

66
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Dysphoria.

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,960
Without the mental illness, it's not a treatment anymore, and you just want to be a trap.

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,680
And sometimes just the best nonsense falls into your lap.

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,800
Me whenever I talk to a real person in the real world.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Why do cis men with horrible LGBT takes always have the worst and most annoying profile pictures?

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,520
Well, that was actually that was purposeful.

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,180
I wanted it to be annoying to this person because they have zero to three commissions

73
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,400
currently occupied.

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I just asked for a commission of a happy, successful conversion therapy patient.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,800
At this point, I just didn't care about these morons anymore, bro.

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,320
Just say you hate queer people and leave this devil's advocate.

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,440
What if type of mentality is just as harmful as people trying to eradicate trans people

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
directly?

79
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Fuck off.

80
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,600
Here's the deal.

81
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,960
I want this guy killed clean shot.

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,600
Who's this homo posting revisionist Marxist read Sartre Sartre.

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Wasn't he one of the French intellectuals who wanted the age of consent abolished?

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,660
Of course, sometimes these people are just fucking insane.

85
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,960
I would have no moral issue with sharp objects dancing very close to your windpipe.

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,520
Look at this guy's bio, dude.

87
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,800
Perma regressed ever child before Joe gamine children's card game appreciator.

88
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,920
Our minds are very young, six, 10, 12, and 16.

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Please be nice.

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,520
So this person claims to have multiple personalities, all very under age.

91
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,160
I guarantee you this person is just a 45 year old man.

92
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,280
Check this person out.

93
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,240
We have no compassion and ask no compassion from you.

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,260
When our turn comes, we will not make excuses for the terror.

95
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,400
It's always great when they just go mask off and like they don't, they don't even pretend

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,880
that it's about the arguments anymore or even that it's about transphobia anymore.

97
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
They just want to hurt you.

98
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
That's it.

99
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,320
However, of course, this person is a fucking permanently online loser.

100
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,600
There will be no terror.

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,220
They experience enough terror trying to order Chinese food over the phone because the local

102
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,640
rat soup shop doesn't have an online portal like Domino's.

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,720
They are never going to do anything in real life.

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,600
Okay, here's an actual argument from Euphoria Tori.

105
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,920
She says any type of pill like this would erase who I am.

106
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,600
I wouldn't be me anymore.

107
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,260
I'd rather die than live like that.

108
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,160
And she's actually engaging with hypothetical.

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,660
The idea is, okay, we have a pill.

110
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,440
Rather than put you on HRT and feminize your body to match your, for lack of better term,

111
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
feminine brain.

112
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,640
I know that's not quite accurate, but you know what I'm talking about.

113
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,920
Instead of feminizing the body to match the brain, what we could do is change the brain

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,360
to match the body.

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,600
That's what this hypothetical is getting at.

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm not saying it's possible.

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
I don't think it's currently possible, but if it were, would it be a good treatment?

118
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880
And Euphoria Tori says, no, it would not be a good treatment because that would be erasing

119
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,340
their current personality.

120
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,400
Personally, I don't think that argument holds up because your current personality is being

121
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,980
erased all the time.

122
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,700
As you move through different phases of your life, you're shedding old identities and picking

123
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
up new ones.

124
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,940
You're not the person that you were five, 10, 20 years ago.

125
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,260
That doesn't mean that that person died.

126
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,820
It doesn't mean that they were erased.

127
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,220
In fact, it means they transitioned.

128
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,180
You transition from child to teenager to adult.

129
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,620
You transition in and out of various physical and mental problems.

130
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,300
You transition between relationships and jobs.

131
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,980
These are all deaths of an identity, but it doesn't constitute the death of yourself,

132
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,060
and you wouldn't even say that.

133
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,860
You are a different person, but the previous person that you were didn't die.

134
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,260
They changed into you.

135
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,580
There is a continuity between the various selves of your past.

136
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,940
Several other people use the identity death logic in this conversation.

137
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,460
Euphoria Tori was just probably the most well-spoken one, but I don't think the logic tracks.

138
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,500
Some people began to say that taking a pill to alter your personality that drastically,

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,580
like Euphoria Tori said, was inherently immoral, like this person here.

140
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,580
Take it further.

141
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,860
A pill that just makes you accept whatever circumstances you're in.

142
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Consumed by grief?

143
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Pill.

144
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
You get racial discrimination for your skin color?

145
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
Pill.

146
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
You are angry at your work conditions?

147
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,860
Politics?

148
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Inequality?

149
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
Pill.

150
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
The issue ultimately is this person is also describing HRT.

151
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,060
HRT doesn't only change your body, it also has mental effects.

152
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,100
She's saying it's this grave sin to alter your mind with a pill, but HRT also does this.

153
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,600
Hell, a lot of recreational drugs that progressives want legalized also do this.

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,380
The only difference that I can see is that my hypothetical is a one-time pill that leaves

155
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
a permanent change.

156
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,220
Okay, if that bugs you, what if the hypothetical treatment alleviated dysphoria, but it didn't

157
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,860
transition you, and you had to keep taking it like HRT?

158
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Would it be immoral?

159
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,020
I don't think so, but I'm not sure progressives would agree.

160
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,680
In fact, at one point somebody brought up transhumanism.

161
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,300
The idea that in the future we'll be doing more extensive edits to our bodies and minds

162
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,660
using advanced technology, and both a dysphoria treatment to bring body in line with brain

163
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,180
and brain in line with body, sounds like transhumanism to me.

164
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,340
But these people didn't like that.

165
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,500
Transhumanism is the freedom to completely self-realize, not the freedom to change someone

166
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,540
else's self.

167
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,020
This person's a pure Utopian.

168
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,440
They don't think that future technology will be used against them.

169
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,940
So I'm assuming that in your perfect world we would have cured autism too?

170
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,900
Um, yes.

171
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,980
You have the most boring idea of transhumanism possible.

172
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,360
Instead of expanding the possibilities of how we can live our lives, trying to keeping

173
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,060
as narrow and intricate as possible.

174
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,660
Listen, modernity has brought some great expansions of possibilities regarding how we can choose

175
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
to live our lives.

176
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,660
For example, I can do something now that I couldn't do 50 years ago.

177
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,700
I can go and do as much fentanyl as I want until I die on the street.

178
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,740
That's a possibility that modernity has brought to me.

179
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
But you know what?

180
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,620
The reason that things are narrow and restricted sometimes is because that's good.

181
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,620
They ultimately didn't have a transhumanist-based argument either.

182
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,220
They simply said, our type of body edits are expanding humanity while yours are eugenics.

183
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,420
And that's not an argument.

184
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,040
That's just more bad thing bad baby logic.

185
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,800
One of the most revolting things about transphobic narratives is the sick, self-satisfied glee

186
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,420
these people manage to extract from fantasizing about a world where trans people no longer

187
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
exist.

188
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,460
This is the transgenocide argument, where the idea is a future where there is no more

189
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,660
trans people means that trans people have been genocided.

190
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,980
I don't think that's true.

191
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,280
I know, for example, I think Vosch believes, and some other people too believe, they believe

192
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,380
that certain hormone imbalances, or I don't know, hormonal events, I don't fucking know,

193
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,560
that happened to the child from the mother while the mother's pregnant is the hypothesis

194
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,940
for causing gender dysphoria at birth.

195
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,020
Okay, let's assume that's the case, just for hypothetical sake.

196
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,120
If we gave all mothers certain pills or shots or whatever that prevented what Vosch calls

197
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,420
these hormone washes, and that made it so that there was no more gender dysphoria, is

198
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,420
that a transgenocide?

199
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,860
There's no more trans people, but there's also no more people suffering from a horrific

200
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
mental illness.

201
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,300
On some level, there seems to be two forces within the trans conversation that are directly

202
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,060
at odds, treating gender dysphoria and the continuation of trans people as a political

203
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,060
block.

204
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,760
Because if we cured cancer, for example, there would definitely be a cancer patient genocide

205
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,460
and that there would be no more cancer patients.

206
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,780
That would be good.

207
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,780
And in fact, with some of these people, I think they've blocked me, I've got to find

208
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
it.

209
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,180
Here we go, I found it finally.

210
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,320
Where does treating pregnant women to ensure nobody is born with gender dysphoria anymore

211
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,660
come into the UN's definition of genocide?

212
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,460
Deliberate targeting of a group, trans people, with the intent of making them not exist anymore.

213
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,620
Some people literally just will outright say it, that a cure for gender dysphoria that

214
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,340
makes it so that people who would have been trans are no longer trans, that's genocide.

215
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,940
And that it's more important that the trans identity, that the trans group, the political

216
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,160
unit, continue forward into the future than it is actually helping cure those people,

217
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,820
in a hypothetical where such a cure existed.

218
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,340
It seems to be the case that to progressives, trans people are just a political pawn.

219
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,660
In fact, this entire conversation is about isolating first principles, although many

220
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,360
of these people just didn't understand this.

221
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,380
I prefer the future, where boring cis dudes shut the fuck up about their hypothetical

222
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,400
magic pill and realize, do you know what a hypothetical is, is not a valid argument.

223
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,020
This person doesn't understand what the point of hypotheticals is.

224
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,620
In fact, in my experience, a lot of people don't understand what the point of a hypothetical

225
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,620
is.

226
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,940
The idea is to get at first principles.

227
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,240
A first principle is when you isolate what's really wrong with a thing.

228
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,480
Most people genuinely don't understand how this works.

229
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,840
I saw a debate Destiny had with an anti-sex work feminist, for example, where she just

230
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
didn't get it.

231
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,580
But in order for us to get to the first principles, we first have to discuss what's at the core

232
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,240
of this conversation.

233
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,420
We all agree conversion therapy is immoral, but to understand why it's immoral, we need

234
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,060
to write down all of the reasons that it is and then start knocking them away one by one

235
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,800
to see which pillar is actually holding the thing up.

236
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,760
So as far as I can tell, all of the possible arguments for why conversion therapy is immoral

237
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,440
are because, one, it's extremely painful, two, it doesn't work, three, it's generally

238
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,780
nonconsensual, and four, it implies that there should be less gay or trans people.

239
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,380
So let's start knocking the legs out.

240
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,380
It's extremely painful.

241
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,480
This isn't an argument.

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,660
Other medical treatments are painful.

243
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,240
We still use them if they work.

244
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,200
Chemo is painful and we do it because it works.

245
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
So does it work?

246
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
No.

247
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,840
So conversion therapy is immoral because it doesn't work.

248
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Okay.

249
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
What if it did work?

250
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Is it consensual?

251
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
No.

252
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,120
So even a working conversion therapy would be immoral if it was always nonconsensual.

253
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Okay.

254
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,040
Should there be less gay or trans people?

255
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,740
My answer to this is it doesn't matter.

256
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,960
For a liberal, this is a value neutral answer.

257
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,740
A room of 100 gay people and zero straight people has the same moral value as a room

258
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,220
full of 100 straight people and zero gay people.

259
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
No more and no less.

260
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,180
So this question doesn't actually matter.

261
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,780
What this means is from a liberal point of view, we've isolated what makes conversion

262
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,100
therapy immoral by stripping away the pieces of it until it does become moral in our eyes.

263
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,060
The arguments it's painful and it implies there should be less gay or trans people contribute

264
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,380
no moral content to conversion therapy.

265
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,900
The arguments it doesn't work and it's nonconsensual do contribute moral content to conversion

266
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
therapy.

267
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,360
Therefore, conversion therapy is immoral because it doesn't work and it's nonconsensual.

268
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,620
And also, if conversion therapy worked and was consented to, it would not be immoral.

269
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,500
But the trans activist couldn't accept this.

270
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,140
To them, it would still be immoral even if it worked and even if people consented because

271
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,620
to them, extra moral content lies elsewhere in conversion therapy.

272
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,620
Let's find it.

273
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,540
I made this follow-up post.

274
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,380
Yes, this would be a form of conversion therapy.

275
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,840
What makes conversion therapy immoral is that it doesn't work.

276
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,780
If conversion therapy worked, then there would be no moral issue with it.

277
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,060
This is an argument that I haven't seen anyone here actually have a good reply to.

278
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,220
Because it seems to be true.

279
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,820
Sam Brinton, for example, ended up being a complete and total liar about his conversion

280
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,320
therapy experience.

281
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,380
But the experience he described in that video was one that was commonly used just, you know,

282
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,800
several decades before Sam Brinton was born.

283
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,480
This is the face of a person who hates a spectrum of human expression and wants to

284
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
squash all uniqueness.

285
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,880
Dude, do you have an argument or not?

286
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
No, that's not what makes it immoral.

287
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,060
It is the fact that conversion therapy tries to take all already marginalized people and

288
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,200
try to break them into fit the box society demands that they slot into.

289
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,880
You're not engaging with the hypothetical.

290
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,780
If they choose it, what's the problem?

291
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,640
This is what I mean when I talk about approaching first principles.

292
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,000
What is it that makes conversion therapy immoral?

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,520
Whether it works has never been the basis on which its morality is judged and ever will

294
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
be.

295
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,720
It's opposite day in your skull.

296
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,560
We could edit people to not be black anymore, so nobody has to deal with racism.

297
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,040
Is that fine to you?

298
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,060
No, we should change society to not be racist.

299
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
Black is a skin color.

300
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,000
It's not a set of behaviors and it's certainly not a mental illness.

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's not the same thing.

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,760
That's not a comparable conversation.

303
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,240
Least genocidal Libra.

304
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,520
This person probably thinks that my existence is genocide because the bloodline of my non-white

305
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,440
ancestors are now part of a white passing genome.

306
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,560
Getting real sick of genocidal freaks like this, treating our lives and bodies like the

307
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,320
quirky little thought experiment.

308
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,360
Is that why you're called the dying Hawaiian?

309
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,960
What makes ethnic cleansing immoral is that it doesn't work.

310
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,360
If it worked, there would be no moral issue with it.

311
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,200
No, because that involves killing people, you moron.

312
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,560
And look, there's just people who are morally outraged, but they have no argument.

313
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,460
Oh fuck, it's not cursed E. What a f- this fucking moron.

314
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,280
This person's blocked me on like six or seven different Twitter accounts, by the way.

315
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,960
I guess I'm not blocked on this one yet.

316
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,640
This is a wild misunderstanding of what makes conversion therapy immoral.

317
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,200
And I'm not surprised to see if only a transgender cure postal them out.

318
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Well, let's see.

319
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
What's her argument?

320
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,760
Conversion practices often involve horrific methods, but even if they didn't and you

321
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,920
had a hundred percent safe way of achieving it, the fact that you desire changing someone

322
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,360
from being LGBTQIA plus at all is bad when you can just leave them alone and stop being

323
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
a fucking bigot.

324
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Here's the thing.

325
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
I don't desire it.

326
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
I don't care.

327
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,880
What's actually going on here is that unlike a liberal, the progressives see that fourth

328
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
argument.

329
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,400
Should there be less gay or trans people?

330
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Not as value neutral.

331
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,640
They don't think the answer to that question is who cares.

332
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,180
For them, more LGBTQIA plus people is a priority good and less is bad, which means that any

333
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,340
hypothetical treatment for dysphoria that results in people not transitioning is inherently

334
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
immoral.

335
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,680
It's part of the trans genocide, even if no one's actually dying because the political

336
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,300
concept of transness is not being carried forward into the next generation.

337
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,760
This doesn't work because the arc of trans liberation is dual tracked, increasing respect

338
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,820
for liberty based bodily autonomy and increased access to medical care for gender dysphoria

339
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,140
are complimentary.

340
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,180
Far in the future, the latter is no issue.

341
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
They're still the former.

342
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,140
Now, of course, they're never going to talk about liberty based bodily autonomy when it

343
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,180
comes to vaccines, but that's not because it was ever about bodily liberty or autonomy.

344
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,940
It's only about the expansion of the trans political block.

345
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,580
Now, some people call being assimilationist, both in terms of a side conversation that

346
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,460
happened regarding ethnicity, but also in terms of the trans question itself, because

347
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,500
there are trans separatists who don't want to actually conform to any sort of normative

348
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
notion of gender.

349
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,360
And then there are trans assimilationists who want to pass and stealth and simply be

350
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,840
treated as the gender as they appear to the people around them.

351
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,440
And in the most extreme trans activist camps, the trans assimilationists, the ones who want

352
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,360
to pass and stealth, they're problematic.

353
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,280
They're problematic because their act of passing upholds the cis heteronormative capitalist

354
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
patriarchy.

355
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,120
They could choose to actively deconstruct these limitations, but instead they're choosing

356
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
to support them by blending in.

357
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,160
I don't know about you, but I personally think assimilation into liberal culture is pretty

358
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
based.

359
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,600
But I do know in terms of ethnicity, I'm happy that I live in a modern society with internet

360
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,480
and video games and heating and food and I'm not living in a fucking teepee.

361
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,320
At the end of the day, these people have very messed up relationships with conversion therapy.

362
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,560
It's easy if you're a normie to wrap your head around this.

363
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,680
If conversion therapy worked and a gay man wanted to be straight, by what rate do you

364
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
tell him he can't?

365
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,640
Any sane person would say, go ahead, it's your life.

366
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,680
But these people have no answer to the question.

367
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,880
They simply see more LGBTQIA plus whatever people existing as an a priori good, regardless

368
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,000
of whether or not that actually makes other people happy.

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,920
Some people said like kind of limp-wristedly, well we'd ask him why they want that, because

370
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,520
it's all part of like internalized homophobia, like hold on, you don't get to interrogate

371
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
people for their preferences.

372
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,320
You don't allow it when they're gay or when they're trans.

373
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,680
Why should you allow it here?

374
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,080
Oh, because they're wanting to transition away from being gay or trans if possible.

375
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,160
And as I said, they view more LGBTQ people existing as an a priori good, independent

376
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,760
of the wishes of those actual people.

377
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,840
That's why they cannot actually engage with the hypothetical.

378
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,240
And I'll probably get banned for it, so hope it was worth it, at least I got a video

379
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
out of it.

380
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,520
Okay, I'm recording this section several days later, sorry the video's late by the

381
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,280
way, and Taftage actually clued me into something very smart going on here.

382
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,200
Transactivism seems to rapidly switch between two perspectives, and this conversation reveals

383
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
it.

384
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
For example, when we talk about trans women in women's sports, the progressive line is

385
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,320
trans women should be able to play in sports with cis women.

386
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,280
But with the exception of the giga-crazies, they don't actually mean all trans women.

387
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,880
They mean trans women who have been on hormones for X number of years to ensure some level

388
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
of fairness.

389
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,000
Whether or not you agree if that can truly be considered fair doesn't actually matter

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
for this conversation.

391
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,260
What matters is how the progressives view their own position.

392
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,320
The logic is, we should understand that trans people are the unfortunate victims of a horrible

393
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,780
mental illness, and that insofar as they can accommodate the fairness of the sport, we

394
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,200
should accommodate them by including them in it, and that trans women who do not qualify

395
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,860
for that medical cutoff, unfortunately can't compete.

396
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,040
This makes trans activism sound like a medical rights lobby, like you'd see for blind people

397
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,600
or deaf people or disabled people.

398
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,320
However, if we talk about the actual treatments for that medical problem, suddenly the progressive

399
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
logic switches.

400
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,940
It's no longer a medical rights lobby, but now it's a lifestyle lobby like gay rights

401
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
activism is.

402
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,560
Now, attempting to cure or treat the condition is framed like trying to treat being gay,

403
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,240
where being gay is value neutral and you're a bigot for thinking that it needs fixing.

404
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,160
This is obviously false because hormones are medical treatment for dysphoria.

405
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,040
If you don't have dysphoria, then your hormones are cosmetic, not medical.

406
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Your transition is cosmetic, not medical.

407
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,020
Your identity is cosmetic, not medical.

408
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,800
And you should be treated as if you are engaged in a cosmetic project, not a medical one.

409
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,440
The trans activists use this motte and bailey to repeatedly switch between the medical rights

410
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,200
lobby, give us compassion because we're suffering, and the lifestyle rights lobby, how dare you

411
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,080
attack us for having a neutral lifestyle that is just like yours, when really, only one

412
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,800
of these two positions can be true.

413
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,140
Anyway, that was just an off-the-cuff video on conversion therapy, at least on the shit

414
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,140
show surrounding my tweet on conversion therapy.

415
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,040
This isn't even my actual analysis of conversion therapy, and you know what?

416
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,880
I'm not even pro-conversion therapy in real life, like, it doesn't work.

417
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,960
That's why you shouldn't do it.

418
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,900
But it really is fun watching all these fucking progs jump all over themselves and shit themselves

419
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
over literally nothing.

420
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,600
Alright guys, I'll see you next time.

421
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,100
I love you.
