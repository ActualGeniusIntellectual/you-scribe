00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for October 14th, 2018.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,400
However, one of my Twitch moderators, Torvar, has suggested that I rename the show

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,360
The Age of Reason. I kinda like it, what do you guys think?

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,600
Before we start, as always, I have a coffee here. This time I have something new.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
I picked up these coffee pods called Midnight Eclipse.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
That sounds real interesting, I'm gonna try it out right now.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,120
It just tastes like regular coffee. I feel like I've been gypped.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,800
Let's begin with this blast from the past, from October 8th, 2016, on Slate.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,040
Donald Trump could have been president. Let's not forget what a terrifying thing we

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:58,000
almost did. I hope this Mr. Isaac Chotiner, whatever,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,840
I hope he lost his job over this article. Let's read this shit.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
Donald Trump is never going to be the President of the United States.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,680
As we sit and digest each successive leak of damaging material, each unendorsement,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,280
each Trump threat to attack Hillary Clinton in the most personal terms imaginable,

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,480
the fact remains that Trump has almost surely destroyed his chance of ever becoming the

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,840
most powerful man on Earth. The discussion will now slowly shift to Republican

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,240
hopes of shoring up down-ballot races and, just wait, the creation of Trump TV.

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,840
But we cannot and should not forget. A couple of days ago it was still fathomable

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,680
that America could have voted into office the biggest threat to the country in decades.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,100
Well, uh, two years down the line, it's still pretty fucking fathomable.

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,280
The danger of Donald Trump is, and always was, two-fold.

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,120
He leads a movement that is bigoted and racist, and plays to people's worst impulses.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,080
Yeah, see, this didn't work two years ago. That's why you lost, because you thought that

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,280
that was going to be your winning gambit. It's also why you lost with Kavanaugh.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,960
It's also why you lost with Brexit. It's why the left has been losing, basically,

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,800
since Gamergate. He promises policies, many of which are bigoted

27
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,600
and racist, you probably just copied and pasted that phrase throughout the article, didn't

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,800
you, that would be extraordinarily dangerous for America.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,680
Well, how dangerous has it been? Because America seems to be doing alright.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Thin-skinned, corrupt, incompetent, bullying, immature, mentally fragile, full of rage.

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,720
All of these qualities have been in ample abundance for well over a year, and in office

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,000
they would promise to be catastrophic. Well, they have been catastrophic, but only

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,520
to the Democrats. The problem with treating Trump's candidacy

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,680
as being so deathly serious, however, was always that, in addition to being a racist

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,360
demagogue, Trump is also a buffoonish jerk who tweets at 3am and loves nothing more than

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,320
to put on a show. Now, I recall very clearly the Hillary vs.

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,880
Obama situation, where one of the big public relations moves that Hillary pulled was that

38
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,040
Hillary would be up at 3am, should there be a disaster.

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,480
Um, but didn't she sleep through Benghazi? I mean, if something goes down at 3am, Trump

40
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,840
will be up dealing with it, but he'll also be up tweeting about it, and maybe you just

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,520
don't like that. But ever since Trump's election, a hidden

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,320
war has been raging. A supernatural war, using powers that humans

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,640
dare not comprehend. Each month, thousands of witches cast a spell

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,880
against Donald Trump. How the witches of the hashtag magic resistance

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,320
rise up against the Trump administration. On a typical Wednesday, by the light of the

46
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,920
waning moon, Kate Doucette joins several thousand strangers on the internet in casting

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,080
a spell to bind Donald Trump. Doucette is one of the resistance witches,

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,040
an at least thirteen thousand strong umbrella group of internet neo-pagans, wiccans, solo

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,920
practitioners who self-identify as hedge witches, long-time magical practitioners in various

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,840
traditions and committed activists. They've come together each month since Trump's inauguration

51
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,600
with one goal, to perform a spell, equal parts quasi-religious ritual and activist performance,

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,440
to bind the president, forming a collective known as the magic resistance.

53
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,960
Well, the good ol' Christian folk of the US of A will not stand for that, so Florida Democrat

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,820
invokes the blood of Jesus against witches and warlocks seeking to harm Donald Trump.

55
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,200
A freshman Florida Democratic House member from Jacksonville, who moonlights as a preacher,

56
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,120
has invoked the blood of Jesus against all witches and warlocks working to curse the

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,000
administration of President Donald Trump and his family.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,800
But there's no way the wizarding world would allow this muggle oppression to go forth unopposed.

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,920
We refuse to be silent any longer, magic as self-care after Kavanaugh. Modern day witches

60
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,160
are creating rituals to foster solidarity, activism, and healing. Magic ritual as a form

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,420
of feminist self-care. First, take a candle, then pour some salt into your hand, preferably

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,540
where there's an open wound. Then, keeping the grains in your palm, take a pen to write

63
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,420
out a thank you to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman whose allegations of sexual assault

64
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,260
against Supreme Court nominee and now Justice Brett Kavanaugh stunned a nation. Or, if you

65
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,340
prefer, simply say, I believe you.

66
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,060
Yeah, we did a dumping with Scrump on Kavanaugh recently, and I covered basically the entire

67
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,940
thing there. I don't think there's any need for me to do a full Kavanaugh video, because

68
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,620
we went over pretty much everything. But this is insanity that there's actually magical

69
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,740
spell-slinging going back and forth over Trump, especially since in retaliation to this, pastors

70
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,180
are calling for prayers to protect Trump from the occult. I don't know if you're going to

71
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,760
believe me when I tell you this, but what's happening right now in America is witchcraft

72
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,660
is trying to take this country over. Make him stronger than ever, Holy Spirit. Lord,

73
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,560
let no weapon be formed against him that will knock him out of power. Help him, Lord.

74
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,960
So who's everyone's bets on? You have the Christians and the power of prayer on the

75
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,080
one side, and you have the Wiccans and the power of magic on the other. Personally, I'm

76
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,560
just going to side with Buddha.

77
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,200
Of course, all of this magical and religious talk is absolutely offensive to Muslims, and

78
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,160
we have to keep that in mind, because a French hero who sacrificed himself to save a hostage

79
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,340
from an Islamist won't have a place named after him, as it may offend Muslims. This

80
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,220
would seem to be contrary to the Not All Muslim hashtag, where very clearly, not all

81
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,700
Muslims are Islamists. Not all Muslims support ISIS. There are a lot of liberal Muslims out

82
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,140
there. Well, if that really is the case, and frankly, I do think that it's probably the

83
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:04,100
case, why would your average Muslim be offended because a man who fought and died against

84
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,500
radical Islam would be given a place of honor in society?

85
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,380
On the 24th of March, 2018, an ISIS terrorist stormed a supermarket, armed with a handgun,

86
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,140
a hunting knife, and three homemade bombs. He shot two people dead and took others hostage.

87
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,580
During the negotiation with the police, the terrorist accepted Beltram's offer to swap

88
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,360
places with the last hostage, a female cashier. Beltram also set his phone on a table with

89
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,240
its line open so that the police outside could monitor the activity inside. After a three-hour

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,800
standoff with police, the terrorist stabbed and murdered the police officer Beltram, but

91
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,280
apparently paying tribute to Beltram's sacrifice is seen as being potentially offensive by

92
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,540
Marseille's leftist elected officials. Here's what Stéphane Ravier, Marseille's 7th District

93
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,780
National Rally mayor, revealed during a town council with the elected officials.

94
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,120
Leftist elected officials, socialist and communist, refused that a place in the 15th district

95
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,520
be named after Arnald Beltram. In the first time they've said, under fallacious pretext,

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,660
that this place wasn't prestigious enough before telling the truth in these terms. We

97
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,100
are on the field, we witness that the population has changed, and if we give the name of Arnald

98
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,720
Beltram in this district, the population will take that as a provocation.

99
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,340
Well, fuck the population. In my opinion, Europe's fucking falling apart. There are

100
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,240
no reason why there should be Islamist enclaves where the rule of law does not extend in European

101
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,700
nations. And regardless of how racist or Islamophobic somebody calls you, there is no reason that

102
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,760
people should put up with massive human rights abuses in our own countries.

103
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Here's another instance of this from Germany. Police file assault charges against father

104
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,280
who defended daughter from migrant sex attack. Police in the German city of Munich have filed

105
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,300
charges against a 42 year old man after he punched a migrant in the face who sexually

106
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,840
assaulted his daughter. In the United States this wouldn't happen. I'm pretty sure even

107
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,560
in Canada it wouldn't happen, though I guarantee you the lefties here are trying to change

108
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,300
that. The incident occurred at a train station and saw an intoxicated 28 year old man reach

109
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,420
under the skirt of a 21 year old woman. After becoming aware of the sex attack, the young

110
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,720
woman's father punched the man in the face.

111
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,300
While police have filed sexual harassment charges against the migrant, they've also

112
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,140
filed charges of bodily injury against the 42 year old. That's self-defense. I mean,

113
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,940
maybe not strictly because it wasn't the father who was sexually assaulted, it was the daughter.

114
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,260
But generally, when you come to the defense of someone else, you shouldn't be charged

115
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,700
unless you use excessive force. And a punch to the face in this instance does not sound

116
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,980
like excessive force.

117
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,500
We've got France, we've got Germany. How about something ridiculous with Islam coming

118
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,900
from the UK? Well, UK clothing store Marks and Spencer is now selling a hijab for three

119
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,820
year olds. For those of you who don't know, the hijab is basically a sign that a woman

120
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,560
is sexually mature enough to enter an adult relationship. And Muslims generally put them

121
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,840
on children from nine years old and up. The main reason being that the widespread belief

122
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,080
that Muhammad's last wife was nine years old and therefore nine is an acceptable age to

123
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,800
start fucking children. However, when you put a hijab on a three year old girl, that

124
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,560
is basically a Muslim saying, yeah, you can fuck this kid. It's disgusting. It's atrocious.

125
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,700
Let's watch Majid Nawaz's video on the subject here.

126
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,900
It's OK to criticize religion. Absolutely. It's OK to criticize democracy. Absolutely.

127
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,640
Scrutinize these ideas all you like. It's OK to criticize British foreign policy. It's

128
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,060
OK to satirize religion, just like it's OK to satirize politicians. You know, you can't

129
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,540
on the one hand applaud spitting image because they're satirizing Margaret Thatcher and yet

130
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,880
then forbid people from satirizing the religion of Islam, which probably has more influence

131
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,060
over people across the world than Margaret Thatcher does. How on earth are you going

132
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,800
to say that you're for holding power to account if some of the most powerful ideas on this

133
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,060
country, in this country, in this world, like religion, suddenly you don't want to allow

134
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,900
for that to be scrutinized? Well, I'm sorry. You can't have it both ways. So religion must

135
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,620
be scrutinized and especially when it's imposed on children. And so for Marks and Spencers

136
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,140
to say as they did when they responded and when they were pressed about this, they said,

137
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,940
they're meeting demand. They said, we've had some orders. We're fulfilling the orders.

138
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,420
And then it said, it's not for us to have a view. They said, it's not for us to have

139
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:54,060
a view on the morality behind sexualizing children by imposing modesty culture on them.

140
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,060
Three year olds. Really? It's not for you to have a view. All right, then Marks and

141
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,180
Spencers. And I know you're listening. I know you're listening because you responded to

142
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,980
me on Twitter. Here's a challenge for you. If it's not for you to have a view on the

143
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,380
morality of stocking headscarves that are designed to preserve the modesty of fully

144
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,780
sexual adult human females, right? It's not for you to take a view and stocking those

145
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,020
for children. Why don't you stock Confederate flag t-shirts as well? See if that suits your,

146
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,860
you know, if there's a demand for it, why not stock it? I'll tell you what, stock t-shirts

147
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,660
with images of monkeys on them, like happened in Sweden or where was it in somewhere in

148
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:40,180
northern Europe, Scandinavian country and adverts of young black kids advertising those

149
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,220
t-shirts with monkeys on them. And fine, you shouldn't have a view. If there's a demand,

150
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,520
stock them. You know, if it's not about morality, do what you like. In fact, why don't you just

151
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,720
stock Nazi uniforms as well? I'm sure there's a demand for those too. But no, you won't.

152
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,380
You won't do any of those things. And I'll tell you why you won't. Because you, like

153
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,140
everyone else in the politically correct climate, is incredibly sensitive when it comes to themes

154
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,500
such as racism and rightly so, themes such as sexism and rightly so. But suddenly when

155
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,620
it comes to minority communities, a bigotry of low expectations kicks in. You abandon

156
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,420
all of your sensitivities, you abandon all of your political high principle. You abandon,

157
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:25,200
in fact, your liberalism and suddenly decide that this other, this, you know, third element

158
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,640
of society, which is the brown Muslim, is no longer expected to adhere to your liberal

159
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,880
values that you apply so strictly on everyone else. Suddenly, we collectively as polite

160
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:43,040
society, because of this bigotry of low expectations, don't think that our values suddenly apply

161
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,980
to minority communities. That's their culture. Let them get on with it. Let them deal with

162
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,140
their own issues. No, these are British children born on British soil. They happen to have

163
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,840
a different skin tone to you and they happen to have a different culture from which their

164
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,820
parents hail. But that doesn't mean that the same values don't apply to them. The same

165
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,460
standards that you would apply and the reasons for why you would not stock confederate flag

166
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,220
t-shirts because you would know that that would get you into trouble over race relations

167
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,180
are the very same reasons that you should not be stocking hijabs for three year olds.

168
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,220
Damn, that guy said it way better than I ever could. Here's some more UK stupidity. Should

169
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:34,900
women be spelt wum-ex-in? Well, no. One because I can't pronounce it. Wumsk-in. Wumsk-in.

170
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,920
To the untrained eye, it may look like a typo. But when the Welcome Collection, a museum

171
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,320
and library in London, sent a tweet promoting an event using the word, it led to a Twitter

172
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,400
backlash from hundreds of women and an apology from the organization. Maybe lefties don't

173
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,720
quite understand why this leads to a backlash. So let me just quickly explain it. People

174
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,920
don't like someone trying to force a new word or force a cultural change. Yes, language

175
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,960
is fluid. Yes, culture is fluid. But they change naturally over long periods of time.

176
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,400
When you try to enforce it, at best, it just seems cringy. Like when someone tries to force

177
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,080
a meme or something. But at worst, it seems authoritarian. Like women, wum-ex-in refers

178
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,760
to females, but it is an attempt to get away from patriarchal language. Dr. Clara Bradbury-Rantz,

179
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,760
fellow at King's College London, well, shouldn't it be Gender Neutral Monarchs College London

180
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,400
now? Says that the spelling stems from a long-standing objection to the word woman as it comes from

181
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,280
man. The word is also supposed to be inclusive of trans women and some non-binary people.

182
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,000
But how is it pronounced? Yeah, that's my biggest question. I've heard it pronounced

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,360
in lots of different ways. I've heard some pronounce it wum-inx. Wum-inx. We're gonna

184
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,120
call them wum-inxes now. Guardian Journalist said the museum's new gender categories are

185
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,080
men and other. Suzy Layton said she would not be referred to as a wum-inx until men

186
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:12,840
became minx. She already said it was demeaning and insulting women. Listen. Nog-nix-ense?

187
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:24,480
A load of bull-lexes? What the f- what the fuck is this? Okay, listen. Listen. There

188
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,840
are definitely things to talk about regarding women's rights, even in the West, especially

189
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,720
for example in the UK, where there are tons of islamists who are eroding women's rights

190
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:44,760
daily. But changing fucking grammar and spelling is a non-issue. It's ridiculous. It's stupid.

191
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,080
It's not about any kind of women's issue. It's about controlling the population. But

192
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,840
here we are. We're at this week's peak UK. Pizzas must shrink or lose their toppings

193
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:04,760
under a government's anti-obesity plan. Oi, mate, you have a license for that pizza.

194
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,000
Makers of ready meals and pizzas could be forced to make their products healthier. Calorie

195
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,900
limits of 928 for pizzas and 695 for savory pies could be introduced under new draft proposals.

196
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,640
Because rather than just letting people choose to be fat, the government has to stick their

197
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,800
hands into everything. Also, wouldn't this be fat-phobic? But by decreasing the amount

198
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,600
of calories in foods, you're going to be committing a genocide against fat people. You're going

199
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,640
to be turning them into thin people. Dr. Allison Tedstone, chief nutritionist, said these are

200
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,300
early days in the calorie reduction program, but the food industry have a responsibility

201
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,560
to act. The simple truth is, on average, we need to eat less. Well, then eat less. Don't

202
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,240
buy a full fucking pizza and eat it all in one sitting, you fat fucks. Children and adults

203
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,280
routinely eat too many calories. Well, stop doing that. I mean, especially with children,

204
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,460
like you're the fucking parent. You say no, you can't have any more to eat. Jesus, like

205
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,600
take responsibility for your fucking lives. Let's end it off with the Kansas City Star

206
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,960
saying white people prefer white people on dating apps, but that could be changed, said

207
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:25,320
the study says. Why would you want to forcibly change someone's sexual interests? What purpose

208
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,380
would that have? I mean, do you want to do it with straight people and make them gay?

209
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,880
Do you want state enforced homosexuality? Dating applications can allow users to fall

210
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,360
into their own racial biases while searching for a partner. Maybe you just like fucking

211
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,140
Asians or something. I don't know. The end goal, the study says, is to promote more diverse

212
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:54,320
pairings in the dating sites. State enforced race mixing. Intimacy is very private and

213
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,440
rightly so, but our private lives have impacts on larger socioeconomic patterns that are

214
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,160
systemic. And that's what's important. The privacy of your life does not matter. What

215
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,560
matters is the system. What matters is the socioeconomic patterns that are systemic.

216
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,000
That's more important. Not, not people, not people's individual lives. Katakara sued Grindr

217
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,640
because some users on the site had captioned saying not interested in Asians. Well, I guess

218
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,720
they should just be forced to fuck you then. Right, Katadara? That's that's what we should

219
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,560
do. Like we should just make it illegal not to have sex with you. Do you remember when

220
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,080
the left was all about no means no and the primacy of consent? What happens in Los Angeles

221
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,880
where you have no fats, no femmes? It happens in South Africa as well. They will say no

222
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,220
rice, no chocolate, no curry. Asian men and black women have the lowest chance of receiving

223
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,760
a message or a response. White people of all ages prefer to go on dates with their white

224
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,680
people. College students are most likely to avoid going on dates with black women. Stephanie

225
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,360
Aboah, a blogger, said she has experienced racism as a black woman on online dating apps.

226
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,280
Some people ask offensive questions like if they can get a taste of jungle fever and say

227
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,300
they want to see if black women are aggressive in bed as they've heard. Well, it sounds like

228
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,640
you're dating assholes. And frankly, if you're looking for partners on a fucking dating app,

229
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,860
yeah, there's going to be assholes there. It's going to be mostly assholes. Comments

230
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,440
such as these are extremely dehumanizing to myself and other black women who are only

231
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,120
looking for companionship. Do you know what's dehumanizing? Using an app like Tinder where

232
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,160
the point of it is casual sex. Okay, I'm not actually shitting on anybody who enjoys casual

233
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,760
sex. You know, it's your life, you do what you want. But during my own short foray into

234
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,840
the casual dating scene back in university, I realized that doing that kind of thing felt

235
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,080
like I was dehumanizing myself. I realized that I wanted relationships, that I wanted

236
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,560
love. And, you know, I'm now in a loving relationship. And I've also been in other

237
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,960
relationships. They didn't work out, obviously, but but they were loving at least when they

238
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,440
started. Um, maybe your problem is that you're dehumanizing yourself. I hate to sound like

239
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,120
a prude, because I'm not not really but maybe maybe maybe what you're doing is you're walking

240
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,560
into a fucking sexual meat market and then complaining that you're there. Okay, Cupid

241
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,700
itself experimented with pairing up users and saying they were highly compatible, even

242
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,620
though they weren't considered good matches, and found that the conversation between the

243
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,160
two people often went well. In other words, it appeared that just the mere suggestion

244
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,080
that two people were compatible, made both users more likely to give the connection a

245
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,640
chance. The study's authors wrote in a press release that it proves the strong power of

246
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,720
suggestion that can be used to bridge the gap between people of different races. And

247
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,120
there's actually some logic to that, like there's definitely a type of personality out

248
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,120
there that refuses all new experiences, but if forced into one will generally have something

249
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,640
positive from it. But at the same time, things like romantic attraction and sex are different

250
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:10,320
from any other experience. If you're not attracted to a certain body type, or skin tone, or dare

251
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:18,400
I say it, set of genitals, simply being exposed to them again, will probably not make you

252
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,040
change your mind. The study's authors conclude that sexual racism is a hard thing to conquer,

253
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,000
but Kyodara, who threatened to sue Grindr, said fixing the problem would improve the

254
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,680
mental well-being of people of color looking for a chance at love on dating apps. Well,

255
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:39,000
you know what? As important as your mental well-being is, it does not trump the ability

256
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,400
of somebody else to give or deny consent to a sexual encounter with you. And that is simply

257
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,400
how it fucking is. No pun intended. I do like how the first comment is, every time a happy white

258
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,920
family is formed, someone out there a shlomo cries. There's a lot of fucking woke takes in

259
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,920
these comments. That does it for me guys, I as a white male I'm gonna spend the rest of my day

260
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,760
with my Jewish girlfriend, hope that doesn't trigger anybody. I'm working on a video on the

261
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,520
the better help situation, I'm hoping to get that out on Tuesday or Wednesday, but knowing me it'll

262
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,440
probably be late. And as always I stream five nights a week Monday to Friday on my twitch

263
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,880
channel, so please drop by and say hello. I hope to see you there. I love you.
