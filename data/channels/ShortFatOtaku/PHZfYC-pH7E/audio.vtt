Hello everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for October 14th, 2018.

00:05.840 --> 00:12.400
However, one of my Twitch moderators, Torvar, has suggested that I rename the show

00:12.400 --> 00:17.360
The Age of Reason. I kinda like it, what do you guys think?

00:17.360 --> 00:21.600
Before we start, as always, I have a coffee here. This time I have something new.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.680
I picked up these coffee pods called Midnight Eclipse.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.720
That sounds real interesting, I'm gonna try it out right now.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.120
It just tastes like regular coffee. I feel like I've been gypped.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.800
Let's begin with this blast from the past, from October 8th, 2016, on Slate.

00:44.800 --> 00:50.040
Donald Trump could have been president. Let's not forget what a terrifying thing we

00:50.040 --> 00:58.000
almost did. I hope this Mr. Isaac Chotiner, whatever,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.840
I hope he lost his job over this article. Let's read this shit.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.320
Donald Trump is never going to be the President of the United States.

01:08.320 --> 01:14.680
As we sit and digest each successive leak of damaging material, each unendorsement,

01:14.680 --> 01:19.280
each Trump threat to attack Hillary Clinton in the most personal terms imaginable,

01:19.280 --> 01:23.480
the fact remains that Trump has almost surely destroyed his chance of ever becoming the

01:23.480 --> 01:29.840
most powerful man on Earth. The discussion will now slowly shift to Republican

01:29.840 --> 01:37.240
hopes of shoring up down-ballot races and, just wait, the creation of Trump TV.

01:37.240 --> 01:42.840
But we cannot and should not forget. A couple of days ago it was still fathomable

01:42.840 --> 01:47.680
that America could have voted into office the biggest threat to the country in decades.

01:47.680 --> 01:54.100
Well, uh, two years down the line, it's still pretty fucking fathomable.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.280
The danger of Donald Trump is, and always was, two-fold.

01:57.280 --> 02:02.120
He leads a movement that is bigoted and racist, and plays to people's worst impulses.

02:02.120 --> 02:08.080
Yeah, see, this didn't work two years ago. That's why you lost, because you thought that

02:08.080 --> 02:12.280
that was going to be your winning gambit. It's also why you lost with Kavanaugh.

02:12.280 --> 02:17.960
It's also why you lost with Brexit. It's why the left has been losing, basically,

02:17.960 --> 02:21.800
since Gamergate. He promises policies, many of which are bigoted

02:21.800 --> 02:25.600
and racist, you probably just copied and pasted that phrase throughout the article, didn't

02:25.600 --> 02:29.800
you, that would be extraordinarily dangerous for America.

02:29.800 --> 02:34.680
Well, how dangerous has it been? Because America seems to be doing alright.

02:34.680 --> 02:41.800
Thin-skinned, corrupt, incompetent, bullying, immature, mentally fragile, full of rage.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.720
All of these qualities have been in ample abundance for well over a year, and in office

02:46.720 --> 02:52.000
they would promise to be catastrophic. Well, they have been catastrophic, but only

02:52.000 --> 02:55.520
to the Democrats. The problem with treating Trump's candidacy

02:55.520 --> 03:00.680
as being so deathly serious, however, was always that, in addition to being a racist

03:00.680 --> 03:06.360
demagogue, Trump is also a buffoonish jerk who tweets at 3am and loves nothing more than

03:06.360 --> 03:10.320
to put on a show. Now, I recall very clearly the Hillary vs.

03:10.320 --> 03:14.880
Obama situation, where one of the big public relations moves that Hillary pulled was that

03:14.880 --> 03:19.040
Hillary would be up at 3am, should there be a disaster.

03:19.040 --> 03:27.480
Um, but didn't she sleep through Benghazi? I mean, if something goes down at 3am, Trump

03:27.480 --> 03:31.840
will be up dealing with it, but he'll also be up tweeting about it, and maybe you just

03:31.840 --> 03:35.520
don't like that. But ever since Trump's election, a hidden

03:35.520 --> 03:40.320
war has been raging. A supernatural war, using powers that humans

03:40.320 --> 03:45.640
dare not comprehend. Each month, thousands of witches cast a spell

03:45.640 --> 03:50.880
against Donald Trump. How the witches of the hashtag magic resistance

03:50.880 --> 03:55.320
rise up against the Trump administration. On a typical Wednesday, by the light of the

03:55.320 --> 04:00.920
waning moon, Kate Doucette joins several thousand strangers on the internet in casting

04:00.920 --> 04:06.080
a spell to bind Donald Trump. Doucette is one of the resistance witches,

04:06.080 --> 04:12.040
an at least thirteen thousand strong umbrella group of internet neo-pagans, wiccans, solo

04:12.040 --> 04:17.920
practitioners who self-identify as hedge witches, long-time magical practitioners in various

04:17.920 --> 04:22.840
traditions and committed activists. They've come together each month since Trump's inauguration

04:22.840 --> 04:29.600
with one goal, to perform a spell, equal parts quasi-religious ritual and activist performance,

04:29.600 --> 04:34.440
to bind the president, forming a collective known as the magic resistance.

04:34.440 --> 04:41.960
Well, the good ol' Christian folk of the US of A will not stand for that, so Florida Democrat

04:41.960 --> 04:47.820
invokes the blood of Jesus against witches and warlocks seeking to harm Donald Trump.

04:47.820 --> 04:53.200
A freshman Florida Democratic House member from Jacksonville, who moonlights as a preacher,

04:53.200 --> 04:57.120
has invoked the blood of Jesus against all witches and warlocks working to curse the

04:57.120 --> 05:00.000
administration of President Donald Trump and his family.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.800
But there's no way the wizarding world would allow this muggle oppression to go forth unopposed.

05:05.800 --> 05:11.920
We refuse to be silent any longer, magic as self-care after Kavanaugh. Modern day witches

05:11.920 --> 05:17.160
are creating rituals to foster solidarity, activism, and healing. Magic ritual as a form

05:17.160 --> 05:23.420
of feminist self-care. First, take a candle, then pour some salt into your hand, preferably

05:23.420 --> 05:29.540
where there's an open wound. Then, keeping the grains in your palm, take a pen to write

05:29.540 --> 05:34.420
out a thank you to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman whose allegations of sexual assault

05:34.420 --> 05:40.260
against Supreme Court nominee and now Justice Brett Kavanaugh stunned a nation. Or, if you

05:40.260 --> 05:42.340
prefer, simply say, I believe you.

05:42.340 --> 05:47.060
Yeah, we did a dumping with Scrump on Kavanaugh recently, and I covered basically the entire

05:47.060 --> 05:51.940
thing there. I don't think there's any need for me to do a full Kavanaugh video, because

05:51.940 --> 05:55.620
we went over pretty much everything. But this is insanity that there's actually magical

05:55.620 --> 06:00.740
spell-slinging going back and forth over Trump, especially since in retaliation to this, pastors

06:00.740 --> 06:05.180
are calling for prayers to protect Trump from the occult. I don't know if you're going to

06:05.180 --> 06:08.760
believe me when I tell you this, but what's happening right now in America is witchcraft

06:08.760 --> 06:13.660
is trying to take this country over. Make him stronger than ever, Holy Spirit. Lord,

06:13.660 --> 06:17.560
let no weapon be formed against him that will knock him out of power. Help him, Lord.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.960
So who's everyone's bets on? You have the Christians and the power of prayer on the

06:21.960 --> 06:26.080
one side, and you have the Wiccans and the power of magic on the other. Personally, I'm

06:26.080 --> 06:27.560
just going to side with Buddha.

06:27.560 --> 06:32.200
Of course, all of this magical and religious talk is absolutely offensive to Muslims, and

06:32.200 --> 06:37.160
we have to keep that in mind, because a French hero who sacrificed himself to save a hostage

06:37.160 --> 06:42.340
from an Islamist won't have a place named after him, as it may offend Muslims. This

06:42.340 --> 06:48.220
would seem to be contrary to the Not All Muslim hashtag, where very clearly, not all

06:48.220 --> 06:53.700
Muslims are Islamists. Not all Muslims support ISIS. There are a lot of liberal Muslims out

06:53.700 --> 06:58.140
there. Well, if that really is the case, and frankly, I do think that it's probably the

06:58.140 --> 07:04.100
case, why would your average Muslim be offended because a man who fought and died against

07:04.100 --> 07:08.500
radical Islam would be given a place of honor in society?

07:08.500 --> 07:13.380
On the 24th of March, 2018, an ISIS terrorist stormed a supermarket, armed with a handgun,

07:13.380 --> 07:19.140
a hunting knife, and three homemade bombs. He shot two people dead and took others hostage.

07:19.140 --> 07:23.580
During the negotiation with the police, the terrorist accepted Beltram's offer to swap

07:23.580 --> 07:28.360
places with the last hostage, a female cashier. Beltram also set his phone on a table with

07:28.360 --> 07:33.240
its line open so that the police outside could monitor the activity inside. After a three-hour

07:33.240 --> 07:39.800
standoff with police, the terrorist stabbed and murdered the police officer Beltram, but

07:39.800 --> 07:45.280
apparently paying tribute to Beltram's sacrifice is seen as being potentially offensive by

07:45.280 --> 07:52.540
Marseille's leftist elected officials. Here's what StÃ©phane Ravier, Marseille's 7th District

07:52.540 --> 07:57.780
National Rally mayor, revealed during a town council with the elected officials.

07:57.780 --> 08:03.120
Leftist elected officials, socialist and communist, refused that a place in the 15th district

08:03.120 --> 08:09.520
be named after Arnald Beltram. In the first time they've said, under fallacious pretext,

08:09.520 --> 08:13.660
that this place wasn't prestigious enough before telling the truth in these terms. We

08:13.660 --> 08:19.100
are on the field, we witness that the population has changed, and if we give the name of Arnald

08:19.100 --> 08:23.720
Beltram in this district, the population will take that as a provocation.

08:23.720 --> 08:29.340
Well, fuck the population. In my opinion, Europe's fucking falling apart. There are

08:29.340 --> 08:35.240
no reason why there should be Islamist enclaves where the rule of law does not extend in European

08:35.240 --> 08:41.700
nations. And regardless of how racist or Islamophobic somebody calls you, there is no reason that

08:41.700 --> 08:45.760
people should put up with massive human rights abuses in our own countries.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.760
Here's another instance of this from Germany. Police file assault charges against father

08:49.760 --> 08:55.280
who defended daughter from migrant sex attack. Police in the German city of Munich have filed

08:55.280 --> 09:00.300
charges against a 42 year old man after he punched a migrant in the face who sexually

09:00.300 --> 09:04.840
assaulted his daughter. In the United States this wouldn't happen. I'm pretty sure even

09:04.840 --> 09:09.560
in Canada it wouldn't happen, though I guarantee you the lefties here are trying to change

09:09.560 --> 09:17.300
that. The incident occurred at a train station and saw an intoxicated 28 year old man reach

09:17.300 --> 09:21.420
under the skirt of a 21 year old woman. After becoming aware of the sex attack, the young

09:21.420 --> 09:24.720
woman's father punched the man in the face.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.300
While police have filed sexual harassment charges against the migrant, they've also

09:29.300 --> 09:35.140
filed charges of bodily injury against the 42 year old. That's self-defense. I mean,

09:35.140 --> 09:40.940
maybe not strictly because it wasn't the father who was sexually assaulted, it was the daughter.

09:40.940 --> 09:46.260
But generally, when you come to the defense of someone else, you shouldn't be charged

09:46.260 --> 09:51.700
unless you use excessive force. And a punch to the face in this instance does not sound

09:51.700 --> 09:52.980
like excessive force.

09:52.980 --> 09:56.500
We've got France, we've got Germany. How about something ridiculous with Islam coming

09:56.500 --> 10:03.900
from the UK? Well, UK clothing store Marks and Spencer is now selling a hijab for three

10:03.900 --> 10:09.820
year olds. For those of you who don't know, the hijab is basically a sign that a woman

10:09.820 --> 10:15.560
is sexually mature enough to enter an adult relationship. And Muslims generally put them

10:15.560 --> 10:21.840
on children from nine years old and up. The main reason being that the widespread belief

10:21.840 --> 10:27.080
that Muhammad's last wife was nine years old and therefore nine is an acceptable age to

10:27.080 --> 10:33.800
start fucking children. However, when you put a hijab on a three year old girl, that

10:33.800 --> 10:40.560
is basically a Muslim saying, yeah, you can fuck this kid. It's disgusting. It's atrocious.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.700
Let's watch Majid Nawaz's video on the subject here.

10:43.700 --> 10:48.900
It's OK to criticize religion. Absolutely. It's OK to criticize democracy. Absolutely.

10:48.900 --> 10:52.640
Scrutinize these ideas all you like. It's OK to criticize British foreign policy. It's

10:52.640 --> 10:58.060
OK to satirize religion, just like it's OK to satirize politicians. You know, you can't

10:58.060 --> 11:02.540
on the one hand applaud spitting image because they're satirizing Margaret Thatcher and yet

11:02.540 --> 11:06.880
then forbid people from satirizing the religion of Islam, which probably has more influence

11:06.880 --> 11:11.060
over people across the world than Margaret Thatcher does. How on earth are you going

11:11.060 --> 11:16.800
to say that you're for holding power to account if some of the most powerful ideas on this

11:16.800 --> 11:22.060
country, in this country, in this world, like religion, suddenly you don't want to allow

11:22.060 --> 11:27.900
for that to be scrutinized? Well, I'm sorry. You can't have it both ways. So religion must

11:27.900 --> 11:33.620
be scrutinized and especially when it's imposed on children. And so for Marks and Spencers

11:33.620 --> 11:39.140
to say as they did when they responded and when they were pressed about this, they said,

11:39.140 --> 11:42.940
they're meeting demand. They said, we've had some orders. We're fulfilling the orders.

11:42.940 --> 11:46.420
And then it said, it's not for us to have a view. They said, it's not for us to have

11:46.420 --> 11:54.060
a view on the morality behind sexualizing children by imposing modesty culture on them.

11:54.060 --> 11:58.060
Three year olds. Really? It's not for you to have a view. All right, then Marks and

11:58.060 --> 12:01.180
Spencers. And I know you're listening. I know you're listening because you responded to

12:01.180 --> 12:07.980
me on Twitter. Here's a challenge for you. If it's not for you to have a view on the

12:07.980 --> 12:13.380
morality of stocking headscarves that are designed to preserve the modesty of fully

12:13.380 --> 12:17.780
sexual adult human females, right? It's not for you to take a view and stocking those

12:17.780 --> 12:24.020
for children. Why don't you stock Confederate flag t-shirts as well? See if that suits your,

12:24.020 --> 12:28.860
you know, if there's a demand for it, why not stock it? I'll tell you what, stock t-shirts

12:28.860 --> 12:32.660
with images of monkeys on them, like happened in Sweden or where was it in somewhere in

12:32.660 --> 12:40.180
northern Europe, Scandinavian country and adverts of young black kids advertising those

12:40.180 --> 12:44.220
t-shirts with monkeys on them. And fine, you shouldn't have a view. If there's a demand,

12:44.220 --> 12:49.520
stock them. You know, if it's not about morality, do what you like. In fact, why don't you just

12:49.520 --> 12:53.720
stock Nazi uniforms as well? I'm sure there's a demand for those too. But no, you won't.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.380
You won't do any of those things. And I'll tell you why you won't. Because you, like

12:57.380 --> 13:02.140
everyone else in the politically correct climate, is incredibly sensitive when it comes to themes

13:02.140 --> 13:07.500
such as racism and rightly so, themes such as sexism and rightly so. But suddenly when

13:07.500 --> 13:13.620
it comes to minority communities, a bigotry of low expectations kicks in. You abandon

13:13.620 --> 13:18.420
all of your sensitivities, you abandon all of your political high principle. You abandon,

13:18.420 --> 13:25.200
in fact, your liberalism and suddenly decide that this other, this, you know, third element

13:25.200 --> 13:29.640
of society, which is the brown Muslim, is no longer expected to adhere to your liberal

13:29.640 --> 13:35.880
values that you apply so strictly on everyone else. Suddenly, we collectively as polite

13:35.880 --> 13:43.040
society, because of this bigotry of low expectations, don't think that our values suddenly apply

13:43.040 --> 13:46.980
to minority communities. That's their culture. Let them get on with it. Let them deal with

13:46.980 --> 13:53.140
their own issues. No, these are British children born on British soil. They happen to have

13:53.140 --> 13:56.840
a different skin tone to you and they happen to have a different culture from which their

13:56.840 --> 14:01.820
parents hail. But that doesn't mean that the same values don't apply to them. The same

14:01.820 --> 14:08.460
standards that you would apply and the reasons for why you would not stock confederate flag

14:08.460 --> 14:13.220
t-shirts because you would know that that would get you into trouble over race relations

14:13.220 --> 14:18.180
are the very same reasons that you should not be stocking hijabs for three year olds.

14:18.180 --> 14:23.220
Damn, that guy said it way better than I ever could. Here's some more UK stupidity. Should

14:23.220 --> 14:34.900
women be spelt wum-ex-in? Well, no. One because I can't pronounce it. Wumsk-in. Wumsk-in.

14:34.900 --> 14:39.920
To the untrained eye, it may look like a typo. But when the Welcome Collection, a museum

14:39.920 --> 14:45.320
and library in London, sent a tweet promoting an event using the word, it led to a Twitter

14:45.320 --> 14:50.400
backlash from hundreds of women and an apology from the organization. Maybe lefties don't

14:50.400 --> 14:54.720
quite understand why this leads to a backlash. So let me just quickly explain it. People

14:54.720 --> 15:01.920
don't like someone trying to force a new word or force a cultural change. Yes, language

15:01.920 --> 15:07.960
is fluid. Yes, culture is fluid. But they change naturally over long periods of time.

15:07.960 --> 15:12.400
When you try to enforce it, at best, it just seems cringy. Like when someone tries to force

15:12.400 --> 15:18.080
a meme or something. But at worst, it seems authoritarian. Like women, wum-ex-in refers

15:18.080 --> 15:24.760
to females, but it is an attempt to get away from patriarchal language. Dr. Clara Bradbury-Rantz,

15:24.760 --> 15:31.760
fellow at King's College London, well, shouldn't it be Gender Neutral Monarchs College London

15:31.760 --> 15:38.400
now? Says that the spelling stems from a long-standing objection to the word woman as it comes from

15:38.400 --> 15:43.280
man. The word is also supposed to be inclusive of trans women and some non-binary people.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.000
But how is it pronounced? Yeah, that's my biggest question. I've heard it pronounced

15:47.000 --> 15:52.360
in lots of different ways. I've heard some pronounce it wum-inx. Wum-inx. We're gonna

15:52.360 --> 15:57.120
call them wum-inxes now. Guardian Journalist said the museum's new gender categories are

15:57.120 --> 16:03.080
men and other. Suzy Layton said she would not be referred to as a wum-inx until men

16:03.080 --> 16:12.840
became minx. She already said it was demeaning and insulting women. Listen. Nog-nix-ense?

16:12.840 --> 16:24.480
A load of bull-lexes? What the f- what the fuck is this? Okay, listen. Listen. There

16:24.480 --> 16:29.840
are definitely things to talk about regarding women's rights, even in the West, especially

16:29.840 --> 16:34.720
for example in the UK, where there are tons of islamists who are eroding women's rights

16:34.720 --> 16:44.760
daily. But changing fucking grammar and spelling is a non-issue. It's ridiculous. It's stupid.

16:44.760 --> 16:49.080
It's not about any kind of women's issue. It's about controlling the population. But

16:49.080 --> 16:55.840
here we are. We're at this week's peak UK. Pizzas must shrink or lose their toppings

16:55.840 --> 17:04.760
under a government's anti-obesity plan. Oi, mate, you have a license for that pizza.

17:04.760 --> 17:11.000
Makers of ready meals and pizzas could be forced to make their products healthier. Calorie

17:11.000 --> 17:19.900
limits of 928 for pizzas and 695 for savory pies could be introduced under new draft proposals.

17:19.900 --> 17:24.640
Because rather than just letting people choose to be fat, the government has to stick their

17:24.640 --> 17:29.800
hands into everything. Also, wouldn't this be fat-phobic? But by decreasing the amount

17:29.800 --> 17:34.600
of calories in foods, you're going to be committing a genocide against fat people. You're going

17:34.600 --> 17:40.640
to be turning them into thin people. Dr. Allison Tedstone, chief nutritionist, said these are

17:40.640 --> 17:45.300
early days in the calorie reduction program, but the food industry have a responsibility

17:45.300 --> 17:50.560
to act. The simple truth is, on average, we need to eat less. Well, then eat less. Don't

17:50.560 --> 17:55.240
buy a full fucking pizza and eat it all in one sitting, you fat fucks. Children and adults

17:55.240 --> 18:01.280
routinely eat too many calories. Well, stop doing that. I mean, especially with children,

18:01.280 --> 18:06.460
like you're the fucking parent. You say no, you can't have any more to eat. Jesus, like

18:06.460 --> 18:10.600
take responsibility for your fucking lives. Let's end it off with the Kansas City Star

18:10.600 --> 18:16.960
saying white people prefer white people on dating apps, but that could be changed, said

18:16.960 --> 18:25.320
the study says. Why would you want to forcibly change someone's sexual interests? What purpose

18:25.320 --> 18:31.380
would that have? I mean, do you want to do it with straight people and make them gay?

18:31.380 --> 18:36.880
Do you want state enforced homosexuality? Dating applications can allow users to fall

18:36.880 --> 18:42.360
into their own racial biases while searching for a partner. Maybe you just like fucking

18:42.360 --> 18:47.140
Asians or something. I don't know. The end goal, the study says, is to promote more diverse

18:47.140 --> 18:54.320
pairings in the dating sites. State enforced race mixing. Intimacy is very private and

18:54.320 --> 19:00.440
rightly so, but our private lives have impacts on larger socioeconomic patterns that are

19:00.440 --> 19:06.160
systemic. And that's what's important. The privacy of your life does not matter. What

19:06.160 --> 19:12.560
matters is the system. What matters is the socioeconomic patterns that are systemic.

19:12.560 --> 19:19.000
That's more important. Not, not people, not people's individual lives. Katakara sued Grindr

19:19.000 --> 19:23.640
because some users on the site had captioned saying not interested in Asians. Well, I guess

19:23.640 --> 19:27.720
they should just be forced to fuck you then. Right, Katadara? That's that's what we should

19:27.720 --> 19:31.560
do. Like we should just make it illegal not to have sex with you. Do you remember when

19:31.560 --> 19:37.080
the left was all about no means no and the primacy of consent? What happens in Los Angeles

19:37.080 --> 19:42.880
where you have no fats, no femmes? It happens in South Africa as well. They will say no

19:42.880 --> 19:50.220
rice, no chocolate, no curry. Asian men and black women have the lowest chance of receiving

19:50.220 --> 19:53.760
a message or a response. White people of all ages prefer to go on dates with their white

19:53.760 --> 19:59.680
people. College students are most likely to avoid going on dates with black women. Stephanie

19:59.680 --> 20:05.360
Aboah, a blogger, said she has experienced racism as a black woman on online dating apps.

20:05.360 --> 20:10.280
Some people ask offensive questions like if they can get a taste of jungle fever and say

20:10.280 --> 20:14.300
they want to see if black women are aggressive in bed as they've heard. Well, it sounds like

20:14.300 --> 20:19.640
you're dating assholes. And frankly, if you're looking for partners on a fucking dating app,

20:19.640 --> 20:23.860
yeah, there's going to be assholes there. It's going to be mostly assholes. Comments

20:23.860 --> 20:27.440
such as these are extremely dehumanizing to myself and other black women who are only

20:27.440 --> 20:33.120
looking for companionship. Do you know what's dehumanizing? Using an app like Tinder where

20:33.120 --> 20:38.160
the point of it is casual sex. Okay, I'm not actually shitting on anybody who enjoys casual

20:38.160 --> 20:42.760
sex. You know, it's your life, you do what you want. But during my own short foray into

20:42.760 --> 20:47.840
the casual dating scene back in university, I realized that doing that kind of thing felt

20:47.840 --> 20:53.080
like I was dehumanizing myself. I realized that I wanted relationships, that I wanted

20:53.080 --> 20:58.560
love. And, you know, I'm now in a loving relationship. And I've also been in other

20:58.560 --> 21:01.960
relationships. They didn't work out, obviously, but but they were loving at least when they

21:01.960 --> 21:08.440
started. Um, maybe your problem is that you're dehumanizing yourself. I hate to sound like

21:08.440 --> 21:15.120
a prude, because I'm not not really but maybe maybe maybe what you're doing is you're walking

21:15.120 --> 21:19.560
into a fucking sexual meat market and then complaining that you're there. Okay, Cupid

21:19.560 --> 21:24.700
itself experimented with pairing up users and saying they were highly compatible, even

21:24.700 --> 21:28.620
though they weren't considered good matches, and found that the conversation between the

21:28.620 --> 21:34.160
two people often went well. In other words, it appeared that just the mere suggestion

21:34.160 --> 21:39.080
that two people were compatible, made both users more likely to give the connection a

21:39.080 --> 21:43.640
chance. The study's authors wrote in a press release that it proves the strong power of

21:43.640 --> 21:48.720
suggestion that can be used to bridge the gap between people of different races. And

21:48.720 --> 21:52.120
there's actually some logic to that, like there's definitely a type of personality out

21:52.120 --> 21:58.120
there that refuses all new experiences, but if forced into one will generally have something

21:58.120 --> 22:02.640
positive from it. But at the same time, things like romantic attraction and sex are different

22:02.640 --> 22:10.320
from any other experience. If you're not attracted to a certain body type, or skin tone, or dare

22:10.320 --> 22:18.400
I say it, set of genitals, simply being exposed to them again, will probably not make you

22:18.400 --> 22:23.040
change your mind. The study's authors conclude that sexual racism is a hard thing to conquer,

22:23.040 --> 22:28.000
but Kyodara, who threatened to sue Grindr, said fixing the problem would improve the

22:28.000 --> 22:32.680
mental well-being of people of color looking for a chance at love on dating apps. Well,

22:32.680 --> 22:39.000
you know what? As important as your mental well-being is, it does not trump the ability

22:39.000 --> 22:46.400
of somebody else to give or deny consent to a sexual encounter with you. And that is simply

22:46.400 --> 22:52.400
how it fucking is. No pun intended. I do like how the first comment is, every time a happy white

22:52.400 --> 22:57.920
family is formed, someone out there a shlomo cries. There's a lot of fucking woke takes in

22:57.920 --> 23:03.920
these comments. That does it for me guys, I as a white male I'm gonna spend the rest of my day

23:03.920 --> 23:08.760
with my Jewish girlfriend, hope that doesn't trigger anybody. I'm working on a video on the

23:08.760 --> 23:14.520
the better help situation, I'm hoping to get that out on Tuesday or Wednesday, but knowing me it'll

23:14.520 --> 23:19.440
probably be late. And as always I stream five nights a week Monday to Friday on my twitch

23:19.440 --> 23:23.880
channel, so please drop by and say hello. I hope to see you there. I love you.
