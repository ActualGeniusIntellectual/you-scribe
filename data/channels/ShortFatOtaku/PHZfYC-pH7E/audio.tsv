0	5840	Hello everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for October 14th, 2018.
5840	12400	However, one of my Twitch moderators, Torvar, has suggested that I rename the show
12400	17360	The Age of Reason. I kinda like it, what do you guys think?
17360	21600	Before we start, as always, I have a coffee here. This time I have something new.
21600	25680	I picked up these coffee pods called Midnight Eclipse.
25680	28720	That sounds real interesting, I'm gonna try it out right now.
30000	39120	It just tastes like regular coffee. I feel like I've been gypped.
39120	44800	Let's begin with this blast from the past, from October 8th, 2016, on Slate.
44800	50040	Donald Trump could have been president. Let's not forget what a terrifying thing we
50040	58000	almost did. I hope this Mr. Isaac Chotiner, whatever,
58000	63840	I hope he lost his job over this article. Let's read this shit.
63840	68320	Donald Trump is never going to be the President of the United States.
68320	74680	As we sit and digest each successive leak of damaging material, each unendorsement,
74680	79280	each Trump threat to attack Hillary Clinton in the most personal terms imaginable,
79280	83480	the fact remains that Trump has almost surely destroyed his chance of ever becoming the
83480	89840	most powerful man on Earth. The discussion will now slowly shift to Republican
89840	97240	hopes of shoring up down-ballot races and, just wait, the creation of Trump TV.
97240	102840	But we cannot and should not forget. A couple of days ago it was still fathomable
102840	107680	that America could have voted into office the biggest threat to the country in decades.
107680	114100	Well, uh, two years down the line, it's still pretty fucking fathomable.
114100	117280	The danger of Donald Trump is, and always was, two-fold.
117280	122120	He leads a movement that is bigoted and racist, and plays to people's worst impulses.
122120	128080	Yeah, see, this didn't work two years ago. That's why you lost, because you thought that
128080	132280	that was going to be your winning gambit. It's also why you lost with Kavanaugh.
132280	137960	It's also why you lost with Brexit. It's why the left has been losing, basically,
137960	141800	since Gamergate. He promises policies, many of which are bigoted
141800	145600	and racist, you probably just copied and pasted that phrase throughout the article, didn't
145600	149800	you, that would be extraordinarily dangerous for America.
149800	154680	Well, how dangerous has it been? Because America seems to be doing alright.
154680	161800	Thin-skinned, corrupt, incompetent, bullying, immature, mentally fragile, full of rage.
161840	166720	All of these qualities have been in ample abundance for well over a year, and in office
166720	172000	they would promise to be catastrophic. Well, they have been catastrophic, but only
172000	175520	to the Democrats. The problem with treating Trump's candidacy
175520	180680	as being so deathly serious, however, was always that, in addition to being a racist
180680	186360	demagogue, Trump is also a buffoonish jerk who tweets at 3am and loves nothing more than
186360	190320	to put on a show. Now, I recall very clearly the Hillary vs.
190320	194880	Obama situation, where one of the big public relations moves that Hillary pulled was that
194880	199040	Hillary would be up at 3am, should there be a disaster.
199040	207480	Um, but didn't she sleep through Benghazi? I mean, if something goes down at 3am, Trump
207480	211840	will be up dealing with it, but he'll also be up tweeting about it, and maybe you just
211840	215520	don't like that. But ever since Trump's election, a hidden
215520	220320	war has been raging. A supernatural war, using powers that humans
220320	225640	dare not comprehend. Each month, thousands of witches cast a spell
225640	230880	against Donald Trump. How the witches of the hashtag magic resistance
230880	235320	rise up against the Trump administration. On a typical Wednesday, by the light of the
235320	240920	waning moon, Kate Doucette joins several thousand strangers on the internet in casting
240920	246080	a spell to bind Donald Trump. Doucette is one of the resistance witches,
246080	252040	an at least thirteen thousand strong umbrella group of internet neo-pagans, wiccans, solo
252040	257920	practitioners who self-identify as hedge witches, long-time magical practitioners in various
257920	262840	traditions and committed activists. They've come together each month since Trump's inauguration
262840	269600	with one goal, to perform a spell, equal parts quasi-religious ritual and activist performance,
269600	274440	to bind the president, forming a collective known as the magic resistance.
274440	281960	Well, the good ol' Christian folk of the US of A will not stand for that, so Florida Democrat
281960	287820	invokes the blood of Jesus against witches and warlocks seeking to harm Donald Trump.
287820	293200	A freshman Florida Democratic House member from Jacksonville, who moonlights as a preacher,
293200	297120	has invoked the blood of Jesus against all witches and warlocks working to curse the
297120	300000	administration of President Donald Trump and his family.
300000	305800	But there's no way the wizarding world would allow this muggle oppression to go forth unopposed.
305800	311920	We refuse to be silent any longer, magic as self-care after Kavanaugh. Modern day witches
311920	317160	are creating rituals to foster solidarity, activism, and healing. Magic ritual as a form
317160	323420	of feminist self-care. First, take a candle, then pour some salt into your hand, preferably
323420	329540	where there's an open wound. Then, keeping the grains in your palm, take a pen to write
329540	334420	out a thank you to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman whose allegations of sexual assault
334420	340260	against Supreme Court nominee and now Justice Brett Kavanaugh stunned a nation. Or, if you
340260	342340	prefer, simply say, I believe you.
342340	347060	Yeah, we did a dumping with Scrump on Kavanaugh recently, and I covered basically the entire
347060	351940	thing there. I don't think there's any need for me to do a full Kavanaugh video, because
351940	355620	we went over pretty much everything. But this is insanity that there's actually magical
355620	360740	spell-slinging going back and forth over Trump, especially since in retaliation to this, pastors
360740	365180	are calling for prayers to protect Trump from the occult. I don't know if you're going to
365180	368760	believe me when I tell you this, but what's happening right now in America is witchcraft
368760	373660	is trying to take this country over. Make him stronger than ever, Holy Spirit. Lord,
373660	377560	let no weapon be formed against him that will knock him out of power. Help him, Lord.
377560	381960	So who's everyone's bets on? You have the Christians and the power of prayer on the
381960	386080	one side, and you have the Wiccans and the power of magic on the other. Personally, I'm
386080	387560	just going to side with Buddha.
387560	392200	Of course, all of this magical and religious talk is absolutely offensive to Muslims, and
392200	397160	we have to keep that in mind, because a French hero who sacrificed himself to save a hostage
397160	402340	from an Islamist won't have a place named after him, as it may offend Muslims. This
402340	408220	would seem to be contrary to the Not All Muslim hashtag, where very clearly, not all
408220	413700	Muslims are Islamists. Not all Muslims support ISIS. There are a lot of liberal Muslims out
413700	418140	there. Well, if that really is the case, and frankly, I do think that it's probably the
418140	424100	case, why would your average Muslim be offended because a man who fought and died against
424100	428500	radical Islam would be given a place of honor in society?
428500	433380	On the 24th of March, 2018, an ISIS terrorist stormed a supermarket, armed with a handgun,
433380	439140	a hunting knife, and three homemade bombs. He shot two people dead and took others hostage.
439140	443580	During the negotiation with the police, the terrorist accepted Beltram's offer to swap
443580	448360	places with the last hostage, a female cashier. Beltram also set his phone on a table with
448360	453240	its line open so that the police outside could monitor the activity inside. After a three-hour
453240	459800	standoff with police, the terrorist stabbed and murdered the police officer Beltram, but
459800	465280	apparently paying tribute to Beltram's sacrifice is seen as being potentially offensive by
465280	472540	Marseille's leftist elected officials. Here's what St√©phane Ravier, Marseille's 7th District
472540	477780	National Rally mayor, revealed during a town council with the elected officials.
477780	483120	Leftist elected officials, socialist and communist, refused that a place in the 15th district
483120	489520	be named after Arnald Beltram. In the first time they've said, under fallacious pretext,
489520	493660	that this place wasn't prestigious enough before telling the truth in these terms. We
493660	499100	are on the field, we witness that the population has changed, and if we give the name of Arnald
499100	503720	Beltram in this district, the population will take that as a provocation.
503720	509340	Well, fuck the population. In my opinion, Europe's fucking falling apart. There are
509340	515240	no reason why there should be Islamist enclaves where the rule of law does not extend in European
515240	521700	nations. And regardless of how racist or Islamophobic somebody calls you, there is no reason that
521700	525760	people should put up with massive human rights abuses in our own countries.
525760	529760	Here's another instance of this from Germany. Police file assault charges against father
529760	535280	who defended daughter from migrant sex attack. Police in the German city of Munich have filed
535280	540300	charges against a 42 year old man after he punched a migrant in the face who sexually
540300	544840	assaulted his daughter. In the United States this wouldn't happen. I'm pretty sure even
544840	549560	in Canada it wouldn't happen, though I guarantee you the lefties here are trying to change
549560	557300	that. The incident occurred at a train station and saw an intoxicated 28 year old man reach
557300	561420	under the skirt of a 21 year old woman. After becoming aware of the sex attack, the young
561420	564720	woman's father punched the man in the face.
564720	569300	While police have filed sexual harassment charges against the migrant, they've also
569300	575140	filed charges of bodily injury against the 42 year old. That's self-defense. I mean,
575140	580940	maybe not strictly because it wasn't the father who was sexually assaulted, it was the daughter.
580940	586260	But generally, when you come to the defense of someone else, you shouldn't be charged
586260	591700	unless you use excessive force. And a punch to the face in this instance does not sound
591700	592980	like excessive force.
592980	596500	We've got France, we've got Germany. How about something ridiculous with Islam coming
596500	603900	from the UK? Well, UK clothing store Marks and Spencer is now selling a hijab for three
603900	609820	year olds. For those of you who don't know, the hijab is basically a sign that a woman
609820	615560	is sexually mature enough to enter an adult relationship. And Muslims generally put them
615560	621840	on children from nine years old and up. The main reason being that the widespread belief
621840	627080	that Muhammad's last wife was nine years old and therefore nine is an acceptable age to
627080	633800	start fucking children. However, when you put a hijab on a three year old girl, that
633800	640560	is basically a Muslim saying, yeah, you can fuck this kid. It's disgusting. It's atrocious.
640560	643700	Let's watch Majid Nawaz's video on the subject here.
643700	648900	It's OK to criticize religion. Absolutely. It's OK to criticize democracy. Absolutely.
648900	652640	Scrutinize these ideas all you like. It's OK to criticize British foreign policy. It's
652640	658060	OK to satirize religion, just like it's OK to satirize politicians. You know, you can't
658060	662540	on the one hand applaud spitting image because they're satirizing Margaret Thatcher and yet
662540	666880	then forbid people from satirizing the religion of Islam, which probably has more influence
666880	671060	over people across the world than Margaret Thatcher does. How on earth are you going
671060	676800	to say that you're for holding power to account if some of the most powerful ideas on this
676800	682060	country, in this country, in this world, like religion, suddenly you don't want to allow
682060	687900	for that to be scrutinized? Well, I'm sorry. You can't have it both ways. So religion must
687900	693620	be scrutinized and especially when it's imposed on children. And so for Marks and Spencers
693620	699140	to say as they did when they responded and when they were pressed about this, they said,
699140	702940	they're meeting demand. They said, we've had some orders. We're fulfilling the orders.
702940	706420	And then it said, it's not for us to have a view. They said, it's not for us to have
706420	714060	a view on the morality behind sexualizing children by imposing modesty culture on them.
714060	718060	Three year olds. Really? It's not for you to have a view. All right, then Marks and
718060	721180	Spencers. And I know you're listening. I know you're listening because you responded to
721180	727980	me on Twitter. Here's a challenge for you. If it's not for you to have a view on the
727980	733380	morality of stocking headscarves that are designed to preserve the modesty of fully
733380	737780	sexual adult human females, right? It's not for you to take a view and stocking those
737780	744020	for children. Why don't you stock Confederate flag t-shirts as well? See if that suits your,
744020	748860	you know, if there's a demand for it, why not stock it? I'll tell you what, stock t-shirts
748860	752660	with images of monkeys on them, like happened in Sweden or where was it in somewhere in
752660	760180	northern Europe, Scandinavian country and adverts of young black kids advertising those
760180	764220	t-shirts with monkeys on them. And fine, you shouldn't have a view. If there's a demand,
764220	769520	stock them. You know, if it's not about morality, do what you like. In fact, why don't you just
769520	773720	stock Nazi uniforms as well? I'm sure there's a demand for those too. But no, you won't.
773720	777380	You won't do any of those things. And I'll tell you why you won't. Because you, like
777380	782140	everyone else in the politically correct climate, is incredibly sensitive when it comes to themes
782140	787500	such as racism and rightly so, themes such as sexism and rightly so. But suddenly when
787500	793620	it comes to minority communities, a bigotry of low expectations kicks in. You abandon
793620	798420	all of your sensitivities, you abandon all of your political high principle. You abandon,
798420	805200	in fact, your liberalism and suddenly decide that this other, this, you know, third element
805200	809640	of society, which is the brown Muslim, is no longer expected to adhere to your liberal
809640	815880	values that you apply so strictly on everyone else. Suddenly, we collectively as polite
815880	823040	society, because of this bigotry of low expectations, don't think that our values suddenly apply
823040	826980	to minority communities. That's their culture. Let them get on with it. Let them deal with
826980	833140	their own issues. No, these are British children born on British soil. They happen to have
833140	836840	a different skin tone to you and they happen to have a different culture from which their
836840	841820	parents hail. But that doesn't mean that the same values don't apply to them. The same
841820	848460	standards that you would apply and the reasons for why you would not stock confederate flag
848460	853220	t-shirts because you would know that that would get you into trouble over race relations
853220	858180	are the very same reasons that you should not be stocking hijabs for three year olds.
858180	863220	Damn, that guy said it way better than I ever could. Here's some more UK stupidity. Should
863220	874900	women be spelt wum-ex-in? Well, no. One because I can't pronounce it. Wumsk-in. Wumsk-in.
874900	879920	To the untrained eye, it may look like a typo. But when the Welcome Collection, a museum
879920	885320	and library in London, sent a tweet promoting an event using the word, it led to a Twitter
885320	890400	backlash from hundreds of women and an apology from the organization. Maybe lefties don't
890400	894720	quite understand why this leads to a backlash. So let me just quickly explain it. People
894720	901920	don't like someone trying to force a new word or force a cultural change. Yes, language
901920	907960	is fluid. Yes, culture is fluid. But they change naturally over long periods of time.
907960	912400	When you try to enforce it, at best, it just seems cringy. Like when someone tries to force
912400	918080	a meme or something. But at worst, it seems authoritarian. Like women, wum-ex-in refers
918080	924760	to females, but it is an attempt to get away from patriarchal language. Dr. Clara Bradbury-Rantz,
924760	931760	fellow at King's College London, well, shouldn't it be Gender Neutral Monarchs College London
931760	938400	now? Says that the spelling stems from a long-standing objection to the word woman as it comes from
938400	943280	man. The word is also supposed to be inclusive of trans women and some non-binary people.
943280	947000	But how is it pronounced? Yeah, that's my biggest question. I've heard it pronounced
947000	952360	in lots of different ways. I've heard some pronounce it wum-inx. Wum-inx. We're gonna
952360	957120	call them wum-inxes now. Guardian Journalist said the museum's new gender categories are
957120	963080	men and other. Suzy Layton said she would not be referred to as a wum-inx until men
963080	972840	became minx. She already said it was demeaning and insulting women. Listen. Nog-nix-ense?
972840	984480	A load of bull-lexes? What the f- what the fuck is this? Okay, listen. Listen. There
984480	989840	are definitely things to talk about regarding women's rights, even in the West, especially
989840	994720	for example in the UK, where there are tons of islamists who are eroding women's rights
994720	1004760	daily. But changing fucking grammar and spelling is a non-issue. It's ridiculous. It's stupid.
1004760	1009080	It's not about any kind of women's issue. It's about controlling the population. But
1009080	1015840	here we are. We're at this week's peak UK. Pizzas must shrink or lose their toppings
1015840	1024760	under a government's anti-obesity plan. Oi, mate, you have a license for that pizza.
1024760	1031000	Makers of ready meals and pizzas could be forced to make their products healthier. Calorie
1031000	1039900	limits of 928 for pizzas and 695 for savory pies could be introduced under new draft proposals.
1039900	1044640	Because rather than just letting people choose to be fat, the government has to stick their
1044640	1049800	hands into everything. Also, wouldn't this be fat-phobic? But by decreasing the amount
1049800	1054600	of calories in foods, you're going to be committing a genocide against fat people. You're going
1054600	1060640	to be turning them into thin people. Dr. Allison Tedstone, chief nutritionist, said these are
1060640	1065300	early days in the calorie reduction program, but the food industry have a responsibility
1065300	1070560	to act. The simple truth is, on average, we need to eat less. Well, then eat less. Don't
1070560	1075240	buy a full fucking pizza and eat it all in one sitting, you fat fucks. Children and adults
1075240	1081280	routinely eat too many calories. Well, stop doing that. I mean, especially with children,
1081280	1086460	like you're the fucking parent. You say no, you can't have any more to eat. Jesus, like
1086460	1090600	take responsibility for your fucking lives. Let's end it off with the Kansas City Star
1090600	1096960	saying white people prefer white people on dating apps, but that could be changed, said
1096960	1105320	the study says. Why would you want to forcibly change someone's sexual interests? What purpose
1105320	1111380	would that have? I mean, do you want to do it with straight people and make them gay?
1111380	1116880	Do you want state enforced homosexuality? Dating applications can allow users to fall
1116880	1122360	into their own racial biases while searching for a partner. Maybe you just like fucking
1122360	1127140	Asians or something. I don't know. The end goal, the study says, is to promote more diverse
1127140	1134320	pairings in the dating sites. State enforced race mixing. Intimacy is very private and
1134320	1140440	rightly so, but our private lives have impacts on larger socioeconomic patterns that are
1140440	1146160	systemic. And that's what's important. The privacy of your life does not matter. What
1146160	1152560	matters is the system. What matters is the socioeconomic patterns that are systemic.
1152560	1159000	That's more important. Not, not people, not people's individual lives. Katakara sued Grindr
1159000	1163640	because some users on the site had captioned saying not interested in Asians. Well, I guess
1163640	1167720	they should just be forced to fuck you then. Right, Katadara? That's that's what we should
1167720	1171560	do. Like we should just make it illegal not to have sex with you. Do you remember when
1171560	1177080	the left was all about no means no and the primacy of consent? What happens in Los Angeles
1177080	1182880	where you have no fats, no femmes? It happens in South Africa as well. They will say no
1182880	1190220	rice, no chocolate, no curry. Asian men and black women have the lowest chance of receiving
1190220	1193760	a message or a response. White people of all ages prefer to go on dates with their white
1193760	1199680	people. College students are most likely to avoid going on dates with black women. Stephanie
1199680	1205360	Aboah, a blogger, said she has experienced racism as a black woman on online dating apps.
1205360	1210280	Some people ask offensive questions like if they can get a taste of jungle fever and say
1210280	1214300	they want to see if black women are aggressive in bed as they've heard. Well, it sounds like
1214300	1219640	you're dating assholes. And frankly, if you're looking for partners on a fucking dating app,
1219640	1223860	yeah, there's going to be assholes there. It's going to be mostly assholes. Comments
1223860	1227440	such as these are extremely dehumanizing to myself and other black women who are only
1227440	1233120	looking for companionship. Do you know what's dehumanizing? Using an app like Tinder where
1233120	1238160	the point of it is casual sex. Okay, I'm not actually shitting on anybody who enjoys casual
1238160	1242760	sex. You know, it's your life, you do what you want. But during my own short foray into
1242760	1247840	the casual dating scene back in university, I realized that doing that kind of thing felt
1247840	1253080	like I was dehumanizing myself. I realized that I wanted relationships, that I wanted
1253080	1258560	love. And, you know, I'm now in a loving relationship. And I've also been in other
1258560	1261960	relationships. They didn't work out, obviously, but but they were loving at least when they
1261960	1268440	started. Um, maybe your problem is that you're dehumanizing yourself. I hate to sound like
1268440	1275120	a prude, because I'm not not really but maybe maybe maybe what you're doing is you're walking
1275120	1279560	into a fucking sexual meat market and then complaining that you're there. Okay, Cupid
1279560	1284700	itself experimented with pairing up users and saying they were highly compatible, even
1284700	1288620	though they weren't considered good matches, and found that the conversation between the
1288620	1294160	two people often went well. In other words, it appeared that just the mere suggestion
1294160	1299080	that two people were compatible, made both users more likely to give the connection a
1299080	1303640	chance. The study's authors wrote in a press release that it proves the strong power of
1303640	1308720	suggestion that can be used to bridge the gap between people of different races. And
1308720	1312120	there's actually some logic to that, like there's definitely a type of personality out
1312120	1318120	there that refuses all new experiences, but if forced into one will generally have something
1318120	1322640	positive from it. But at the same time, things like romantic attraction and sex are different
1322640	1330320	from any other experience. If you're not attracted to a certain body type, or skin tone, or dare
1330320	1338400	I say it, set of genitals, simply being exposed to them again, will probably not make you
1338400	1343040	change your mind. The study's authors conclude that sexual racism is a hard thing to conquer,
1343040	1348000	but Kyodara, who threatened to sue Grindr, said fixing the problem would improve the
1348000	1352680	mental well-being of people of color looking for a chance at love on dating apps. Well,
1352680	1359000	you know what? As important as your mental well-being is, it does not trump the ability
1359000	1366400	of somebody else to give or deny consent to a sexual encounter with you. And that is simply
1366400	1372400	how it fucking is. No pun intended. I do like how the first comment is, every time a happy white
1372400	1377920	family is formed, someone out there a shlomo cries. There's a lot of fucking woke takes in
1377920	1383920	these comments. That does it for me guys, I as a white male I'm gonna spend the rest of my day
1383920	1388760	with my Jewish girlfriend, hope that doesn't trigger anybody. I'm working on a video on the
1388760	1394520	the better help situation, I'm hoping to get that out on Tuesday or Wednesday, but knowing me it'll
1394520	1399440	probably be late. And as always I stream five nights a week Monday to Friday on my twitch
1399440	1403880	channel, so please drop by and say hello. I hope to see you there. I love you.
