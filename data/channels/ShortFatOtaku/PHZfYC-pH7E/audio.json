{"text": " Hello everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for October 14th, 2018. However, one of my Twitch moderators, Torvar, has suggested that I rename the show The Age of Reason. I kinda like it, what do you guys think? Before we start, as always, I have a coffee here. This time I have something new. I picked up these coffee pods called Midnight Eclipse. That sounds real interesting, I'm gonna try it out right now. It just tastes like regular coffee. I feel like I've been gypped. Let's begin with this blast from the past, from October 8th, 2016, on Slate. Donald Trump could have been president. Let's not forget what a terrifying thing we almost did. I hope this Mr. Isaac Chotiner, whatever, I hope he lost his job over this article. Let's read this shit. Donald Trump is never going to be the President of the United States. As we sit and digest each successive leak of damaging material, each unendorsement, each Trump threat to attack Hillary Clinton in the most personal terms imaginable, the fact remains that Trump has almost surely destroyed his chance of ever becoming the most powerful man on Earth. The discussion will now slowly shift to Republican hopes of shoring up down-ballot races and, just wait, the creation of Trump TV. But we cannot and should not forget. A couple of days ago it was still fathomable that America could have voted into office the biggest threat to the country in decades. Well, uh, two years down the line, it's still pretty fucking fathomable. The danger of Donald Trump is, and always was, two-fold. He leads a movement that is bigoted and racist, and plays to people's worst impulses. Yeah, see, this didn't work two years ago. That's why you lost, because you thought that that was going to be your winning gambit. It's also why you lost with Kavanaugh. It's also why you lost with Brexit. It's why the left has been losing, basically, since Gamergate. He promises policies, many of which are bigoted and racist, you probably just copied and pasted that phrase throughout the article, didn't you, that would be extraordinarily dangerous for America. Well, how dangerous has it been? Because America seems to be doing alright. Thin-skinned, corrupt, incompetent, bullying, immature, mentally fragile, full of rage. All of these qualities have been in ample abundance for well over a year, and in office they would promise to be catastrophic. Well, they have been catastrophic, but only to the Democrats. The problem with treating Trump's candidacy as being so deathly serious, however, was always that, in addition to being a racist demagogue, Trump is also a buffoonish jerk who tweets at 3am and loves nothing more than to put on a show. Now, I recall very clearly the Hillary vs. Obama situation, where one of the big public relations moves that Hillary pulled was that Hillary would be up at 3am, should there be a disaster. Um, but didn't she sleep through Benghazi? I mean, if something goes down at 3am, Trump will be up dealing with it, but he'll also be up tweeting about it, and maybe you just don't like that. But ever since Trump's election, a hidden war has been raging. A supernatural war, using powers that humans dare not comprehend. Each month, thousands of witches cast a spell against Donald Trump. How the witches of the hashtag magic resistance rise up against the Trump administration. On a typical Wednesday, by the light of the waning moon, Kate Doucette joins several thousand strangers on the internet in casting a spell to bind Donald Trump. Doucette is one of the resistance witches, an at least thirteen thousand strong umbrella group of internet neo-pagans, wiccans, solo practitioners who self-identify as hedge witches, long-time magical practitioners in various traditions and committed activists. They've come together each month since Trump's inauguration with one goal, to perform a spell, equal parts quasi-religious ritual and activist performance, to bind the president, forming a collective known as the magic resistance. Well, the good ol' Christian folk of the US of A will not stand for that, so Florida Democrat invokes the blood of Jesus against witches and warlocks seeking to harm Donald Trump. A freshman Florida Democratic House member from Jacksonville, who moonlights as a preacher, has invoked the blood of Jesus against all witches and warlocks working to curse the administration of President Donald Trump and his family. But there's no way the wizarding world would allow this muggle oppression to go forth unopposed. We refuse to be silent any longer, magic as self-care after Kavanaugh. Modern day witches are creating rituals to foster solidarity, activism, and healing. Magic ritual as a form of feminist self-care. First, take a candle, then pour some salt into your hand, preferably where there's an open wound. Then, keeping the grains in your palm, take a pen to write out a thank you to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman whose allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee and now Justice Brett Kavanaugh stunned a nation. Or, if you prefer, simply say, I believe you. Yeah, we did a dumping with Scrump on Kavanaugh recently, and I covered basically the entire thing there. I don't think there's any need for me to do a full Kavanaugh video, because we went over pretty much everything. But this is insanity that there's actually magical spell-slinging going back and forth over Trump, especially since in retaliation to this, pastors are calling for prayers to protect Trump from the occult. I don't know if you're going to believe me when I tell you this, but what's happening right now in America is witchcraft is trying to take this country over. Make him stronger than ever, Holy Spirit. Lord, let no weapon be formed against him that will knock him out of power. Help him, Lord. So who's everyone's bets on? You have the Christians and the power of prayer on the one side, and you have the Wiccans and the power of magic on the other. Personally, I'm just going to side with Buddha. Of course, all of this magical and religious talk is absolutely offensive to Muslims, and we have to keep that in mind, because a French hero who sacrificed himself to save a hostage from an Islamist won't have a place named after him, as it may offend Muslims. This would seem to be contrary to the Not All Muslim hashtag, where very clearly, not all Muslims are Islamists. Not all Muslims support ISIS. There are a lot of liberal Muslims out there. Well, if that really is the case, and frankly, I do think that it's probably the case, why would your average Muslim be offended because a man who fought and died against radical Islam would be given a place of honor in society? On the 24th of March, 2018, an ISIS terrorist stormed a supermarket, armed with a handgun, a hunting knife, and three homemade bombs. He shot two people dead and took others hostage. During the negotiation with the police, the terrorist accepted Beltram's offer to swap places with the last hostage, a female cashier. Beltram also set his phone on a table with its line open so that the police outside could monitor the activity inside. After a three-hour standoff with police, the terrorist stabbed and murdered the police officer Beltram, but apparently paying tribute to Beltram's sacrifice is seen as being potentially offensive by Marseille's leftist elected officials. Here's what St\u00e9phane Ravier, Marseille's 7th District National Rally mayor, revealed during a town council with the elected officials. Leftist elected officials, socialist and communist, refused that a place in the 15th district be named after Arnald Beltram. In the first time they've said, under fallacious pretext, that this place wasn't prestigious enough before telling the truth in these terms. We are on the field, we witness that the population has changed, and if we give the name of Arnald Beltram in this district, the population will take that as a provocation. Well, fuck the population. In my opinion, Europe's fucking falling apart. There are no reason why there should be Islamist enclaves where the rule of law does not extend in European nations. And regardless of how racist or Islamophobic somebody calls you, there is no reason that people should put up with massive human rights abuses in our own countries. Here's another instance of this from Germany. Police file assault charges against father who defended daughter from migrant sex attack. Police in the German city of Munich have filed charges against a 42 year old man after he punched a migrant in the face who sexually assaulted his daughter. In the United States this wouldn't happen. I'm pretty sure even in Canada it wouldn't happen, though I guarantee you the lefties here are trying to change that. The incident occurred at a train station and saw an intoxicated 28 year old man reach under the skirt of a 21 year old woman. After becoming aware of the sex attack, the young woman's father punched the man in the face. While police have filed sexual harassment charges against the migrant, they've also filed charges of bodily injury against the 42 year old. That's self-defense. I mean, maybe not strictly because it wasn't the father who was sexually assaulted, it was the daughter. But generally, when you come to the defense of someone else, you shouldn't be charged unless you use excessive force. And a punch to the face in this instance does not sound like excessive force. We've got France, we've got Germany. How about something ridiculous with Islam coming from the UK? Well, UK clothing store Marks and Spencer is now selling a hijab for three year olds. For those of you who don't know, the hijab is basically a sign that a woman is sexually mature enough to enter an adult relationship. And Muslims generally put them on children from nine years old and up. The main reason being that the widespread belief that Muhammad's last wife was nine years old and therefore nine is an acceptable age to start fucking children. However, when you put a hijab on a three year old girl, that is basically a Muslim saying, yeah, you can fuck this kid. It's disgusting. It's atrocious. Let's watch Majid Nawaz's video on the subject here. It's OK to criticize religion. Absolutely. It's OK to criticize democracy. Absolutely. Scrutinize these ideas all you like. It's OK to criticize British foreign policy. It's OK to satirize religion, just like it's OK to satirize politicians. You know, you can't on the one hand applaud spitting image because they're satirizing Margaret Thatcher and yet then forbid people from satirizing the religion of Islam, which probably has more influence over people across the world than Margaret Thatcher does. How on earth are you going to say that you're for holding power to account if some of the most powerful ideas on this country, in this country, in this world, like religion, suddenly you don't want to allow for that to be scrutinized? Well, I'm sorry. You can't have it both ways. So religion must be scrutinized and especially when it's imposed on children. And so for Marks and Spencers to say as they did when they responded and when they were pressed about this, they said, they're meeting demand. They said, we've had some orders. We're fulfilling the orders. And then it said, it's not for us to have a view. They said, it's not for us to have a view on the morality behind sexualizing children by imposing modesty culture on them. Three year olds. Really? It's not for you to have a view. All right, then Marks and Spencers. And I know you're listening. I know you're listening because you responded to me on Twitter. Here's a challenge for you. If it's not for you to have a view on the morality of stocking headscarves that are designed to preserve the modesty of fully sexual adult human females, right? It's not for you to take a view and stocking those for children. Why don't you stock Confederate flag t-shirts as well? See if that suits your, you know, if there's a demand for it, why not stock it? I'll tell you what, stock t-shirts with images of monkeys on them, like happened in Sweden or where was it in somewhere in northern Europe, Scandinavian country and adverts of young black kids advertising those t-shirts with monkeys on them. And fine, you shouldn't have a view. If there's a demand, stock them. You know, if it's not about morality, do what you like. In fact, why don't you just stock Nazi uniforms as well? I'm sure there's a demand for those too. But no, you won't. You won't do any of those things. And I'll tell you why you won't. Because you, like everyone else in the politically correct climate, is incredibly sensitive when it comes to themes such as racism and rightly so, themes such as sexism and rightly so. But suddenly when it comes to minority communities, a bigotry of low expectations kicks in. You abandon all of your sensitivities, you abandon all of your political high principle. You abandon, in fact, your liberalism and suddenly decide that this other, this, you know, third element of society, which is the brown Muslim, is no longer expected to adhere to your liberal values that you apply so strictly on everyone else. Suddenly, we collectively as polite society, because of this bigotry of low expectations, don't think that our values suddenly apply to minority communities. That's their culture. Let them get on with it. Let them deal with their own issues. No, these are British children born on British soil. They happen to have a different skin tone to you and they happen to have a different culture from which their parents hail. But that doesn't mean that the same values don't apply to them. The same standards that you would apply and the reasons for why you would not stock confederate flag t-shirts because you would know that that would get you into trouble over race relations are the very same reasons that you should not be stocking hijabs for three year olds. Damn, that guy said it way better than I ever could. Here's some more UK stupidity. Should women be spelt wum-ex-in? Well, no. One because I can't pronounce it. Wumsk-in. Wumsk-in. To the untrained eye, it may look like a typo. But when the Welcome Collection, a museum and library in London, sent a tweet promoting an event using the word, it led to a Twitter backlash from hundreds of women and an apology from the organization. Maybe lefties don't quite understand why this leads to a backlash. So let me just quickly explain it. People don't like someone trying to force a new word or force a cultural change. Yes, language is fluid. Yes, culture is fluid. But they change naturally over long periods of time. When you try to enforce it, at best, it just seems cringy. Like when someone tries to force a meme or something. But at worst, it seems authoritarian. Like women, wum-ex-in refers to females, but it is an attempt to get away from patriarchal language. Dr. Clara Bradbury-Rantz, fellow at King's College London, well, shouldn't it be Gender Neutral Monarchs College London now? Says that the spelling stems from a long-standing objection to the word woman as it comes from man. The word is also supposed to be inclusive of trans women and some non-binary people. But how is it pronounced? Yeah, that's my biggest question. I've heard it pronounced in lots of different ways. I've heard some pronounce it wum-inx. Wum-inx. We're gonna call them wum-inxes now. Guardian Journalist said the museum's new gender categories are men and other. Suzy Layton said she would not be referred to as a wum-inx until men became minx. She already said it was demeaning and insulting women. Listen. Nog-nix-ense? A load of bull-lexes? What the f- what the fuck is this? Okay, listen. Listen. There are definitely things to talk about regarding women's rights, even in the West, especially for example in the UK, where there are tons of islamists who are eroding women's rights daily. But changing fucking grammar and spelling is a non-issue. It's ridiculous. It's stupid. It's not about any kind of women's issue. It's about controlling the population. But here we are. We're at this week's peak UK. Pizzas must shrink or lose their toppings under a government's anti-obesity plan. Oi, mate, you have a license for that pizza. Makers of ready meals and pizzas could be forced to make their products healthier. Calorie limits of 928 for pizzas and 695 for savory pies could be introduced under new draft proposals. Because rather than just letting people choose to be fat, the government has to stick their hands into everything. Also, wouldn't this be fat-phobic? But by decreasing the amount of calories in foods, you're going to be committing a genocide against fat people. You're going to be turning them into thin people. Dr. Allison Tedstone, chief nutritionist, said these are early days in the calorie reduction program, but the food industry have a responsibility to act. The simple truth is, on average, we need to eat less. Well, then eat less. Don't buy a full fucking pizza and eat it all in one sitting, you fat fucks. Children and adults routinely eat too many calories. Well, stop doing that. I mean, especially with children, like you're the fucking parent. You say no, you can't have any more to eat. Jesus, like take responsibility for your fucking lives. Let's end it off with the Kansas City Star saying white people prefer white people on dating apps, but that could be changed, said the study says. Why would you want to forcibly change someone's sexual interests? What purpose would that have? I mean, do you want to do it with straight people and make them gay? Do you want state enforced homosexuality? Dating applications can allow users to fall into their own racial biases while searching for a partner. Maybe you just like fucking Asians or something. I don't know. The end goal, the study says, is to promote more diverse pairings in the dating sites. State enforced race mixing. Intimacy is very private and rightly so, but our private lives have impacts on larger socioeconomic patterns that are systemic. And that's what's important. The privacy of your life does not matter. What matters is the system. What matters is the socioeconomic patterns that are systemic. That's more important. Not, not people, not people's individual lives. Katakara sued Grindr because some users on the site had captioned saying not interested in Asians. Well, I guess they should just be forced to fuck you then. Right, Katadara? That's that's what we should do. Like we should just make it illegal not to have sex with you. Do you remember when the left was all about no means no and the primacy of consent? What happens in Los Angeles where you have no fats, no femmes? It happens in South Africa as well. They will say no rice, no chocolate, no curry. Asian men and black women have the lowest chance of receiving a message or a response. White people of all ages prefer to go on dates with their white people. College students are most likely to avoid going on dates with black women. Stephanie Aboah, a blogger, said she has experienced racism as a black woman on online dating apps. Some people ask offensive questions like if they can get a taste of jungle fever and say they want to see if black women are aggressive in bed as they've heard. Well, it sounds like you're dating assholes. And frankly, if you're looking for partners on a fucking dating app, yeah, there's going to be assholes there. It's going to be mostly assholes. Comments such as these are extremely dehumanizing to myself and other black women who are only looking for companionship. Do you know what's dehumanizing? Using an app like Tinder where the point of it is casual sex. Okay, I'm not actually shitting on anybody who enjoys casual sex. You know, it's your life, you do what you want. But during my own short foray into the casual dating scene back in university, I realized that doing that kind of thing felt like I was dehumanizing myself. I realized that I wanted relationships, that I wanted love. And, you know, I'm now in a loving relationship. And I've also been in other relationships. They didn't work out, obviously, but but they were loving at least when they started. Um, maybe your problem is that you're dehumanizing yourself. I hate to sound like a prude, because I'm not not really but maybe maybe maybe what you're doing is you're walking into a fucking sexual meat market and then complaining that you're there. Okay, Cupid itself experimented with pairing up users and saying they were highly compatible, even though they weren't considered good matches, and found that the conversation between the two people often went well. In other words, it appeared that just the mere suggestion that two people were compatible, made both users more likely to give the connection a chance. The study's authors wrote in a press release that it proves the strong power of suggestion that can be used to bridge the gap between people of different races. And there's actually some logic to that, like there's definitely a type of personality out there that refuses all new experiences, but if forced into one will generally have something positive from it. But at the same time, things like romantic attraction and sex are different from any other experience. If you're not attracted to a certain body type, or skin tone, or dare I say it, set of genitals, simply being exposed to them again, will probably not make you change your mind. The study's authors conclude that sexual racism is a hard thing to conquer, but Kyodara, who threatened to sue Grindr, said fixing the problem would improve the mental well-being of people of color looking for a chance at love on dating apps. Well, you know what? As important as your mental well-being is, it does not trump the ability of somebody else to give or deny consent to a sexual encounter with you. And that is simply how it fucking is. No pun intended. I do like how the first comment is, every time a happy white family is formed, someone out there a shlomo cries. There's a lot of fucking woke takes in these comments. That does it for me guys, I as a white male I'm gonna spend the rest of my day with my Jewish girlfriend, hope that doesn't trigger anybody. I'm working on a video on the the better help situation, I'm hoping to get that out on Tuesday or Wednesday, but knowing me it'll probably be late. And as always I stream five nights a week Monday to Friday on my twitch channel, so please drop by and say hello. I hope to see you there. I love you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.84, "text": " Hello everyone, welcome to SJ Weekly for October 14th, 2018.", "tokens": [50363, 18435, 2506, 11, 7062, 284, 31766, 18168, 329, 3267, 1478, 400, 11, 2864, 13, 50655], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1566627684093657, "compression_ratio": 1.467153284671533, "no_speech_prob": 0.004749378189444542}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 5.84, "end": 12.4, "text": " However, one of my Twitch moderators, Torvar, has suggested that I rename the show", "tokens": [50655, 2102, 11, 530, 286, 616, 23835, 37265, 11, 4022, 7785, 11, 468, 5220, 326, 314, 36265, 262, 905, 50983], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1566627684093657, "compression_ratio": 1.467153284671533, "no_speech_prob": 0.004749378189444542}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 12.4, "end": 17.36, "text": " The Age of Reason.
