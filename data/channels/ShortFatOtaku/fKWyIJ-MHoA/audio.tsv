0	10460	Hello friends, Dev here with you once again for TikTok Tuesday.
10460	14640	It's a beautiful day out, there's been a huge storm in my region, it's finally passed.
14640	20440	I don't know if you can hear those birds outside.
20440	24480	It's a beautiful day, the forest has come alive once again, Naomi and I went out into
24480	27960	the city to do some errands, it's just been all in all a great day.
27960	31620	About an extra hour or so between now and when we start streaming the new Star Wars
31620	33060	game tonight on the channel.
33060	37560	So I'm settling down for lunch with a bowl of homemade spicy ramen and we're going to
37560	43340	look over some TikTok nonsense that you guys have DM'd me on Discord once again.
43340	46360	So thanks for that guys, I didn't want to live that long anyway.
46360	51660	First things first, apparently there's a new TikTok challenge, this time eating the plastic
51660	54820	wrapping that comes with fruit roll ups.
54820	59120	The fruit roll ups legal team just debunked a TikTok trend claiming the plastic wrapper
59120	60120	is edible.
60120	64400	Who thought like, alright, you know I shouldn't be surprised, Tide Pod challenge, every other
64400	67820	challenge on the, I think I even did a video back in the day about all the dumb challenges
67820	68960	that people have done.
68960	74140	The Nyquil chicken challenge, going viral on the internet is just retarded nowadays.
74140	81860	Okay, Stitch with hollyberry09, legal is making me clarify you should not attempt to eat plastic
81860	84260	from the official fruit roll ups TikTok.
84320	85840	I didn't know fruit roll ups had a TikTok.
85840	87840	Plastic doesn't freeze I'm pretty sure.
91200	91700	What?
91700	93700	Okay, there's no way.
93700	95700	Let's see.
95700	98700	Alright, fresh out of the freezer.
98700	100700	Let's see.
100700	101700	Let's see.
101700	105700	Um, she may be right.
106700	107700	Ooh.
109700	110700	Nope.
110700	111700	Plastic.
111700	113700	Why would you try this?
114140	116740	Like there are some dumb challenges out there, this one takes the cake.
116740	118380	Just eat the plastic, fuck it.
118380	122060	But if only everything else that you guys have sent me would be as wholesome as that.
122060	123560	Are you ready for the diarrhea?
123560	125220	I'm just here to take notes.
125220	126220	I take excellent notes.
126220	128220	Alright, what are we taking notes on?
128220	133300	They've tried to extinguish tear gas canisters with water bottles using traffic cones and
133300	136020	metal bowls to snuff out the gas before it spreads.
136020	137820	Oh, how to protest.
137820	138820	How to be an antifin member.
138820	142280	On the front lines, many demonstrators wear makeshift armor.
142860	147760	They also show protesters forming human supply chains, some over one mile long.
147760	152360	And to communicate what supplies are needed, they use hand signals passed along the chain.
152360	153760	Imagine having this much free time.
153760	156080	In this video, protesters are asking for helmets.
156080	158240	Like I got too much stuff going on, man.
158240	162240	Several videos show how the massive crowds part to allow ambulances free passage.
162240	165380	Oh wait, these are Hong Kong protests.
165380	170300	Protesters have adopted a strategy they're calling B-Water in order to evade the police.
170300	174020	It means that they move quickly rather than occupying a single location.
174020	176800	That's why it doesn't look like an antifa, actually.
176800	178340	So that's all interesting stuff.
178340	183780	But as you can see, it's much more organized because they're actually fighting a bad government.
183780	184780	That's not happening in the States.
184780	190180	You know, for all the bad stuff that, you know, America or Canada or the UK or any Western
190180	195220	nation might do, not as bad as China and the whole like, oh, I'm just taking down notes
195220	197740	that we can copy what they do over here.
197740	200160	It's like unnecessary, unwarranted.
200160	202400	You want to reduce your participation in capitalism?
202400	203400	No I don't.
203400	205200	You can move your money out of the for-profit banking system.
205200	207880	If you're in the US like me, you're probably using one of these four banks.
207880	211420	All of them are for-profit, which means they're extracting as much profit as they can from
211420	212420	your money.
212420	215320	The good news is that you can take your money out of this extractive system by banking with
215320	217080	a credit union or a nonprofit bank.
217080	220400	So as far as I understand, the difference between capitalism and socialism has nothing
220400	221400	to do with money.
221400	226440	It has everything to do with the worker's relationship to the means of production.
226440	230680	You don't change your relationship to the means of production by banking with a different
230680	231680	bank, right?
231680	232680	Now credit unions are fine.
232680	235760	For those of you who don't know what a credit union is, it's basically, it offers the same
235760	241240	service as a bank, but it's a worker co-op bank basically.
241240	246360	But only kind of because it's the people who actually bank with it actually own part of
246360	248640	the company and they're nonprofit.
248640	252760	The issue ultimately with credit unions is that, and at least in my parents' experience
252760	258340	because they used one for a while, it was harder to get certain large-scale loans.
258340	261840	For example, if you want to get a mortgage so you can pay off a house or something, you
261840	262840	can get that from a bank.
262840	264160	It's much harder to get from a credit union.
264160	265320	They have their place in the market.
265320	270120	They're a good idea, but this idea that this is how you disengage from capitalism, nope.
270120	271440	That's not how it works, man.
271440	274820	Everything I'm going to mention has to do with building civic and institutional power.
274820	276080	It's all about numbers.
276080	278900	It's all about bonds, baby.
278900	282940	The bullet trained giga Chad's guide to dismantling capitalism.
282940	285920	These are all still anti-capitalist ones, guys.
285920	286920	What's this list here?
286920	288660	Propaganda, of course, is propaganda.
288660	290660	Harkens back to my Gramsci video.
290660	292100	Number one is propaganda.
292100	295060	We have got to control the narrative on the internet and IRL.
295060	299940	I don't care if it's music, videos, jokes, thought-provoking essays, performative memes,
299940	301340	man, all that shit.
301340	305100	Let this critique should be bleeding into even the most apolitical spaces on the internet.
305100	307460	I'm talking makeup, vlogging, gaming.
307460	312500	Listen, listen, they don't want you to have any, any break from their politics.
312500	316300	Leftist critique needs to bleed into every single apolitical space.
316300	317300	No it fucking doesn't.
317300	321580	And in fact, when you see someone doing that shit, you just need to say, no, fuck you.
321580	325040	We're not here to talk about politics, but everything's fucking off.
325040	329900	Number two, we need left leaning and sympathetic characters and institutions of power and media
329900	335060	to help facilitate and protect revolutionary action and help control the professional narrative.
335060	336060	Yep, there it is.
336060	337120	They just outright say it.
337120	341660	They need to put their plants into the institutions and then those people need to misuse the power
341660	344240	from their positions to push those politics.
344240	346480	That is something that we absolutely have to resist.
346480	348520	While we're at it, cut it with the anti-voting shit.
348520	349520	It makes no fucking sense.
349520	350520	Good luck buddy.
350520	351520	It's not revolutionary action.
351520	353520	Number three, no more label wars.
353520	354520	It's anti-praxis.
354520	356080	You're going to work with an ML.
356080	357780	You're going to work with an anarchist.
357780	358780	Get over it.
358780	359780	We don't have to be a hive mind.
359780	361640	We just have to operate like one.
361640	363720	Dude, dude, you're going to work with an ML.
363720	366160	You're going to work with a Marxist Leninist.
366160	367160	This is the thing.
367160	368160	This is what left unity means.
368160	372520	It means basically the people who say, Oh, we're not like the tankies.
372520	373520	It's okay.
373520	374520	We're actually the good ones.
374520	377360	We're just like the Bernie Sanders sock dams or whatever the fuck.
377360	378360	No, no.
378360	380060	They're going to work with the MLS.
380060	381060	They're going to work with the market.
381060	382060	They're going to work with tankies.
382060	383060	They're going to Stalinist.
383060	384060	That's how it's going to be.
384060	385060	All right.
385060	386060	And you know what?
386060	389460	Within that leftist unity, the Stalinists being the most bloodthirsty, they will win
389460	390680	that internal fight.
390680	393980	This is why it always degenerates into this sort of authoritarianism.
393980	398420	Number four, no more USSR aesthetic, no more Molotov cocktail aesthetic.
398420	399420	This shit's lame.
399420	400420	We got a new one.
400420	404420	We're bullet train giga chats because fixing shit is awesome and ignoring problems is lame
404420	405540	and weak chain.
405540	406540	That's right.
406540	407540	That's right.
407540	408540	They're doing the whole bullet train thing.
408540	411300	It's like, how come every other country has, you know, bullet trains?
411300	412300	Why can't America?
412300	414300	Well, America's bigger than Germany.
414300	415820	America's bigger than Japan.
415820	420900	And also most people don't want to really go to the various internal States.
420900	426540	They want to go to Florida, Texas, New York, LA, and then like Washington state.
426540	429860	That's where most of the people who would use the bullet trains actually want to go.
429860	432260	They don't want to have a bullet train that goes across the United States.
432260	434620	There's just no demand for it, but that's their new aesthetic.
434620	439260	They're, uh, they're giving up the USSR aesthetic even as they side with Marxist Leninists.
439260	440260	Okay.
440260	441260	We get it.
441260	442260	The subversiveness.
442260	443260	We get it.
443260	445540	Also, there's already so much anti-communist propaganda out there that it makes it really
445540	448900	fucking hard to radicalize people when they're already turned off by the symbolism.
448900	450560	And of course, this is the same thing.
450560	453200	Their radicalism good, their enemies' radicalism bad.
453200	455720	The truth is no one's radicalism is good.
455720	459680	Number five, if you can't boil down theory so that liberals, normies, and baby leftist
459680	462400	can latch onto it, stay out of the agitprop game.
462400	464400	You're not helping as much as you think you are.
464400	468520	And at some point it gets pretty counterproductive when all you're doing is beating other leftists
468520	470580	over the head with the amount of books you've read.
470580	472440	Keep doing that shit.
472440	474920	Dude, their theory is so fucking stupid.
474920	478800	No one has ever actually made the theory digestible because the theory does not map onto reality.
478800	479800	All right.
479800	481720	That's the hard truth of it.
481720	483240	This shit don't work.
483240	486280	Number six, it's time to rebuild community cohesion.
486280	490700	Start a block party, invite your neighbors over, maybe discuss a few local policies like
490700	493660	the potholes or the speed trap at the end of your neighbor.
493660	497640	Build friendships with your coworkers and agitate unionization in your workplace.
497640	499960	Uplift some motherfuckers, engage in mutual aid.
499960	502120	People are more likely to help you if you help them.
502120	507320	The funniest part about that is that if these people actually did that, they would recognize
507320	511440	just how conservative the working class around them actually is.
511440	514360	Yeah, some of them might be okay with unions.
514360	517040	Some of them might want the potholes to be fixed.
517040	521280	But as soon as you talk about cultural issues, as soon as you talk about, let's say religion,
521280	523980	they are going to have opinions that you don't like.
523980	527880	And that natural reflex to purity spiral is going to kick right in.
527880	530000	This shit always falls apart.
530000	532920	Moreover, man, I have a friend group already.
532920	536080	I don't really want to get involved with the local community around me.
536080	539380	You know that old phrase, tall fences make good neighbors?
539380	543760	This whole idea just bleeds into the, we should be in each other's business more.
543760	545260	And I just don't agree with that.
545260	549200	My neighbors have no right to know what I do in the privacy of my own life.
549200	550480	And I have no right to know what they do.
550480	552800	My community is not the people who live in my street.
552800	557200	It's certainly not, by the way, back when you used to work like a normie job, it's certainly
557200	558200	not my coworkers.
558200	560400	Fuck, I never want to see any of them ever again.
560400	561400	Fuck.
561400	562720	The minute I punched out, I was out of there.
562720	563720	Fuck those people.
564000	567400	I don't want to bring politics into my, you know, normie friend space.
567400	568400	Fuck that.
568400	572660	Number seven, protests and demonstrations have got to be a confederation of organizations.
572660	576800	From what I've seen from my IRL, these things go way smoother when we have a division of
576800	577800	labor.
577800	579280	Picture this with me for a second.
579280	584340	One huge decentralized mass equating the strength in numbers, a division of labor groups responsible
584340	588920	for medical protection, legal resources, oh, division of labor, dude.
588920	591660	That doesn't, that doesn't really jive with what Marx is writing about.
591660	593340	These people are like delusional.
593340	594860	They're fucking delusional.
594860	596620	This shit's never going down.
596620	599820	This one's got music, hold on.
599820	600820	This one's got music.
600820	601820	Hold on.
601820	604580	Maybe I'll just, I'll turn off the music here real quick and we'll play it again.
604580	606420	It seems like there's only text though.
606420	610380	If you're a cis gay or lesbian and refuse to date trans folk, you're transphobic.
610380	614260	Your genitalia preference is as weird and colonizer as fuck.
614260	619060	Is this one of the trans cells where this person's angry that like a lesbian who, you
619060	622460	know, only wants women with vaginas won't date her because she has a penis?
622580	623580	Is that what this is?
623580	627340	Imagine being so entitled that you think that you can just have sex with people and if they
627340	628700	won't you call them bigoted.
628700	632900	The concept of consent just flies out the window with these people as soon as it's them
632900	633900	being told no.
633900	640140	I, uh, made a joke on Twitter a few weeks ago that the incel uprising is actually happening.
640140	642620	It's just happening with a bunch of trans maxers now.
642620	643620	I...
643620	644620	Non-binary range.
644620	645620	Oh my God.
645620	646620	A lady.
646620	647620	You're not?
647620	649620	Not a fucking...
650620	652620	I see boobs though.
652620	654820	Hold on, let's watch that again.
654820	659620	I'm not a lady, but you have a face of a girl, you have the hair of a girl, like you look
659620	663940	very tomboy-ish, but you're also going to look like a druggie, but nonetheless, like
663940	669360	I feel for people who try their best to pass as the other gender and then they get insulted
669360	670360	in public.
670360	672740	Like that's probably a pretty rough feeling, you know?
672740	674140	It's a pretty rude thing to do.
674140	679100	This person though, all you've done is just throw on a baseball cap and a baggy sweater.
679100	682540	In fact, you look kind of like my girlfriend when she's just lounging around the house.
682540	684340	She doesn't have to dress up for anybody, you know?
684340	687420	If you want to be gender as a man by the people, you have to look like one.
687420	690720	All right guys, I've had my spicy ramen slow cooking this whole time.
690720	692740	It's about ready, so it's time for me to go.
692740	694100	Thanks for being here, everyone.
694100	695100	I love you.
695100	697780	Oh, and I'll see you tonight for Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.
697780	698780	Maybe.
698780	699780	Maybe not.
699780	700280	I love you.
