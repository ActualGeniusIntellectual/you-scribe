00:00.000 --> 00:10.460
Hello friends, Dev here with you once again for TikTok Tuesday.

00:10.460 --> 00:14.640
It's a beautiful day out, there's been a huge storm in my region, it's finally passed.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.440
I don't know if you can hear those birds outside.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.480
It's a beautiful day, the forest has come alive once again, Naomi and I went out into

00:24.480 --> 00:27.960
the city to do some errands, it's just been all in all a great day.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.620
About an extra hour or so between now and when we start streaming the new Star Wars

00:31.620 --> 00:33.060
game tonight on the channel.

00:33.060 --> 00:37.560
So I'm settling down for lunch with a bowl of homemade spicy ramen and we're going to

00:37.560 --> 00:43.340
look over some TikTok nonsense that you guys have DM'd me on Discord once again.

00:43.340 --> 00:46.360
So thanks for that guys, I didn't want to live that long anyway.

00:46.360 --> 00:51.660
First things first, apparently there's a new TikTok challenge, this time eating the plastic

00:51.660 --> 00:54.820
wrapping that comes with fruit roll ups.

00:54.820 --> 00:59.120
The fruit roll ups legal team just debunked a TikTok trend claiming the plastic wrapper

00:59.120 --> 01:00.120
is edible.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.400
Who thought like, alright, you know I shouldn't be surprised, Tide Pod challenge, every other

01:04.400 --> 01:07.820
challenge on the, I think I even did a video back in the day about all the dumb challenges

01:07.820 --> 01:08.960
that people have done.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.140
The Nyquil chicken challenge, going viral on the internet is just retarded nowadays.

01:14.140 --> 01:21.860
Okay, Stitch with hollyberry09, legal is making me clarify you should not attempt to eat plastic

01:21.860 --> 01:24.260
from the official fruit roll ups TikTok.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.840
I didn't know fruit roll ups had a TikTok.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.840
Plastic doesn't freeze I'm pretty sure.

01:31.200 --> 01:31.700
What?

01:31.700 --> 01:33.700
Okay, there's no way.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.700
Let's see.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.700
Alright, fresh out of the freezer.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.700
Let's see.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.700
Let's see.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.700
Um, she may be right.

01:46.700 --> 01:47.700
Ooh.

01:49.700 --> 01:50.700
Nope.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.700
Plastic.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.700
Why would you try this?

01:54.140 --> 01:56.740
Like there are some dumb challenges out there, this one takes the cake.

01:56.740 --> 01:58.380
Just eat the plastic, fuck it.

01:58.380 --> 02:02.060
But if only everything else that you guys have sent me would be as wholesome as that.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.560
Are you ready for the diarrhea?

02:03.560 --> 02:05.220
I'm just here to take notes.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.220
I take excellent notes.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.220
Alright, what are we taking notes on?

02:08.220 --> 02:13.300
They've tried to extinguish tear gas canisters with water bottles using traffic cones and

02:13.300 --> 02:16.020
metal bowls to snuff out the gas before it spreads.

02:16.020 --> 02:17.820
Oh, how to protest.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.820
How to be an antifin member.

02:18.820 --> 02:22.280
On the front lines, many demonstrators wear makeshift armor.

02:22.860 --> 02:27.760
They also show protesters forming human supply chains, some over one mile long.

02:27.760 --> 02:32.360
And to communicate what supplies are needed, they use hand signals passed along the chain.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.760
Imagine having this much free time.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.080
In this video, protesters are asking for helmets.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.240
Like I got too much stuff going on, man.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.240
Several videos show how the massive crowds part to allow ambulances free passage.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.380
Oh wait, these are Hong Kong protests.

02:45.380 --> 02:50.300
Protesters have adopted a strategy they're calling B-Water in order to evade the police.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.020
It means that they move quickly rather than occupying a single location.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.800
That's why it doesn't look like an antifa, actually.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.340
So that's all interesting stuff.

02:58.340 --> 03:03.780
But as you can see, it's much more organized because they're actually fighting a bad government.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.780
That's not happening in the States.

03:04.780 --> 03:10.180
You know, for all the bad stuff that, you know, America or Canada or the UK or any Western

03:10.180 --> 03:15.220
nation might do, not as bad as China and the whole like, oh, I'm just taking down notes

03:15.220 --> 03:17.740
that we can copy what they do over here.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.160
It's like unnecessary, unwarranted.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.400
You want to reduce your participation in capitalism?

03:22.400 --> 03:23.400
No I don't.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.200
You can move your money out of the for-profit banking system.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.880
If you're in the US like me, you're probably using one of these four banks.

03:27.880 --> 03:31.420
All of them are for-profit, which means they're extracting as much profit as they can from

03:31.420 --> 03:32.420
your money.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.320
The good news is that you can take your money out of this extractive system by banking with

03:35.320 --> 03:37.080
a credit union or a nonprofit bank.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.400
So as far as I understand, the difference between capitalism and socialism has nothing

03:40.400 --> 03:41.400
to do with money.

03:41.400 --> 03:46.440
It has everything to do with the worker's relationship to the means of production.

03:46.440 --> 03:50.680
You don't change your relationship to the means of production by banking with a different

03:50.680 --> 03:51.680
bank, right?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.680
Now credit unions are fine.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.760
For those of you who don't know what a credit union is, it's basically, it offers the same

03:55.760 --> 04:01.240
service as a bank, but it's a worker co-op bank basically.

04:01.240 --> 04:06.360
But only kind of because it's the people who actually bank with it actually own part of

04:06.360 --> 04:08.640
the company and they're nonprofit.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.760
The issue ultimately with credit unions is that, and at least in my parents' experience

04:12.760 --> 04:18.340
because they used one for a while, it was harder to get certain large-scale loans.

04:18.340 --> 04:21.840
For example, if you want to get a mortgage so you can pay off a house or something, you

04:21.840 --> 04:22.840
can get that from a bank.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.160
It's much harder to get from a credit union.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.320
They have their place in the market.

04:25.320 --> 04:30.120
They're a good idea, but this idea that this is how you disengage from capitalism, nope.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.440
That's not how it works, man.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.820
Everything I'm going to mention has to do with building civic and institutional power.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.080
It's all about numbers.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.900
It's all about bonds, baby.

04:38.900 --> 04:42.940
The bullet trained giga Chad's guide to dismantling capitalism.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.920
These are all still anti-capitalist ones, guys.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.920
What's this list here?

04:46.920 --> 04:48.660
Propaganda, of course, is propaganda.

04:48.660 --> 04:50.660
Harkens back to my Gramsci video.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.100
Number one is propaganda.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.060
We have got to control the narrative on the internet and IRL.

04:55.060 --> 04:59.940
I don't care if it's music, videos, jokes, thought-provoking essays, performative memes,

04:59.940 --> 05:01.340
man, all that shit.

05:01.340 --> 05:05.100
Let this critique should be bleeding into even the most apolitical spaces on the internet.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.460
I'm talking makeup, vlogging, gaming.

05:07.460 --> 05:12.500
Listen, listen, they don't want you to have any, any break from their politics.

05:12.500 --> 05:16.300
Leftist critique needs to bleed into every single apolitical space.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.300
No it fucking doesn't.

05:17.300 --> 05:21.580
And in fact, when you see someone doing that shit, you just need to say, no, fuck you.

05:21.580 --> 05:25.040
We're not here to talk about politics, but everything's fucking off.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.900
Number two, we need left leaning and sympathetic characters and institutions of power and media

05:29.900 --> 05:35.060
to help facilitate and protect revolutionary action and help control the professional narrative.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.060
Yep, there it is.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.120
They just outright say it.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.660
They need to put their plants into the institutions and then those people need to misuse the power

05:41.660 --> 05:44.240
from their positions to push those politics.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.480
That is something that we absolutely have to resist.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.520
While we're at it, cut it with the anti-voting shit.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.520
It makes no fucking sense.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.520
Good luck buddy.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.520
It's not revolutionary action.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.520
Number three, no more label wars.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.520
It's anti-praxis.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.080
You're going to work with an ML.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.780
You're going to work with an anarchist.

05:57.780 --> 05:58.780
Get over it.

05:58.780 --> 05:59.780
We don't have to be a hive mind.

05:59.780 --> 06:01.640
We just have to operate like one.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.720
Dude, dude, you're going to work with an ML.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.160
You're going to work with a Marxist Leninist.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.160
This is the thing.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.160
This is what left unity means.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.520
It means basically the people who say, Oh, we're not like the tankies.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.520
It's okay.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
We're actually the good ones.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.360
We're just like the Bernie Sanders sock dams or whatever the fuck.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
No, no.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.060
They're going to work with the MLS.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.060
They're going to work with the market.

06:21.060 --> 06:22.060
They're going to work with tankies.

06:22.060 --> 06:23.060
They're going to Stalinist.

06:23.060 --> 06:24.060
That's how it's going to be.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.060
All right.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.060
And you know what?

06:26.060 --> 06:29.460
Within that leftist unity, the Stalinists being the most bloodthirsty, they will win

06:29.460 --> 06:30.680
that internal fight.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.980
This is why it always degenerates into this sort of authoritarianism.

06:33.980 --> 06:38.420
Number four, no more USSR aesthetic, no more Molotov cocktail aesthetic.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.420
This shit's lame.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.420
We got a new one.

06:40.420 --> 06:44.420
We're bullet train giga chats because fixing shit is awesome and ignoring problems is lame

06:44.420 --> 06:45.540
and weak chain.

06:45.540 --> 06:46.540
That's right.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.540
That's right.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.540
They're doing the whole bullet train thing.

06:48.540 --> 06:51.300
It's like, how come every other country has, you know, bullet trains?

06:51.300 --> 06:52.300
Why can't America?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
Well, America's bigger than Germany.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.820
America's bigger than Japan.

06:55.820 --> 07:00.900
And also most people don't want to really go to the various internal States.

07:00.900 --> 07:06.540
They want to go to Florida, Texas, New York, LA, and then like Washington state.

07:06.540 --> 07:09.860
That's where most of the people who would use the bullet trains actually want to go.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.260
They don't want to have a bullet train that goes across the United States.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.620
There's just no demand for it, but that's their new aesthetic.

07:14.620 --> 07:19.260
They're, uh, they're giving up the USSR aesthetic even as they side with Marxist Leninists.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.260
Okay.

07:20.260 --> 07:21.260
We get it.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.260
The subversiveness.

07:22.260 --> 07:23.260
We get it.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.540
Also, there's already so much anti-communist propaganda out there that it makes it really

07:25.540 --> 07:28.900
fucking hard to radicalize people when they're already turned off by the symbolism.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.560
And of course, this is the same thing.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.200
Their radicalism good, their enemies' radicalism bad.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.720
The truth is no one's radicalism is good.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.680
Number five, if you can't boil down theory so that liberals, normies, and baby leftist

07:39.680 --> 07:42.400
can latch onto it, stay out of the agitprop game.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.400
You're not helping as much as you think you are.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.520
And at some point it gets pretty counterproductive when all you're doing is beating other leftists

07:48.520 --> 07:50.580
over the head with the amount of books you've read.

07:50.580 --> 07:52.440
Keep doing that shit.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.920
Dude, their theory is so fucking stupid.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.800
No one has ever actually made the theory digestible because the theory does not map onto reality.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.800
All right.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.720
That's the hard truth of it.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.240
This shit don't work.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.280
Number six, it's time to rebuild community cohesion.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.700
Start a block party, invite your neighbors over, maybe discuss a few local policies like

08:10.700 --> 08:13.660
the potholes or the speed trap at the end of your neighbor.

08:13.660 --> 08:17.640
Build friendships with your coworkers and agitate unionization in your workplace.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.960
Uplift some motherfuckers, engage in mutual aid.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.120
People are more likely to help you if you help them.

08:22.120 --> 08:27.320
The funniest part about that is that if these people actually did that, they would recognize

08:27.320 --> 08:31.440
just how conservative the working class around them actually is.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.360
Yeah, some of them might be okay with unions.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.040
Some of them might want the potholes to be fixed.

08:37.040 --> 08:41.280
But as soon as you talk about cultural issues, as soon as you talk about, let's say religion,

08:41.280 --> 08:43.980
they are going to have opinions that you don't like.

08:43.980 --> 08:47.880
And that natural reflex to purity spiral is going to kick right in.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.000
This shit always falls apart.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.920
Moreover, man, I have a friend group already.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.080
I don't really want to get involved with the local community around me.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.380
You know that old phrase, tall fences make good neighbors?

08:59.380 --> 09:03.760
This whole idea just bleeds into the, we should be in each other's business more.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.260
And I just don't agree with that.

09:05.260 --> 09:09.200
My neighbors have no right to know what I do in the privacy of my own life.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.480
And I have no right to know what they do.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.800
My community is not the people who live in my street.

09:12.800 --> 09:17.200
It's certainly not, by the way, back when you used to work like a normie job, it's certainly

09:17.200 --> 09:18.200
not my coworkers.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.400
Fuck, I never want to see any of them ever again.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.400
Fuck.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.720
The minute I punched out, I was out of there.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.720
Fuck those people.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.400
I don't want to bring politics into my, you know, normie friend space.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
Fuck that.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.660
Number seven, protests and demonstrations have got to be a confederation of organizations.

09:32.660 --> 09:36.800
From what I've seen from my IRL, these things go way smoother when we have a division of

09:36.800 --> 09:37.800
labor.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.280
Picture this with me for a second.

09:39.280 --> 09:44.340
One huge decentralized mass equating the strength in numbers, a division of labor groups responsible

09:44.340 --> 09:48.920
for medical protection, legal resources, oh, division of labor, dude.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.660
That doesn't, that doesn't really jive with what Marx is writing about.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.340
These people are like delusional.

09:53.340 --> 09:54.860
They're fucking delusional.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.620
This shit's never going down.

09:56.620 --> 09:59.820
This one's got music, hold on.

09:59.820 --> 10:00.820
This one's got music.

10:00.820 --> 10:01.820
Hold on.

10:01.820 --> 10:04.580
Maybe I'll just, I'll turn off the music here real quick and we'll play it again.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.420
It seems like there's only text though.

10:06.420 --> 10:10.380
If you're a cis gay or lesbian and refuse to date trans folk, you're transphobic.

10:10.380 --> 10:14.260
Your genitalia preference is as weird and colonizer as fuck.

10:14.260 --> 10:19.060
Is this one of the trans cells where this person's angry that like a lesbian who, you

10:19.060 --> 10:22.460
know, only wants women with vaginas won't date her because she has a penis?

10:22.580 --> 10:23.580
Is that what this is?

10:23.580 --> 10:27.340
Imagine being so entitled that you think that you can just have sex with people and if they

10:27.340 --> 10:28.700
won't you call them bigoted.

10:28.700 --> 10:32.900
The concept of consent just flies out the window with these people as soon as it's them

10:32.900 --> 10:33.900
being told no.

10:33.900 --> 10:40.140
I, uh, made a joke on Twitter a few weeks ago that the incel uprising is actually happening.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.620
It's just happening with a bunch of trans maxers now.

10:42.620 --> 10:43.620
I...

10:43.620 --> 10:44.620
Non-binary range.

10:44.620 --> 10:45.620
Oh my God.

10:45.620 --> 10:46.620
A lady.

10:46.620 --> 10:47.620
You're not?

10:47.620 --> 10:49.620
Not a fucking...

10:50.620 --> 10:52.620
I see boobs though.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.820
Hold on, let's watch that again.

10:54.820 --> 10:59.620
I'm not a lady, but you have a face of a girl, you have the hair of a girl, like you look

10:59.620 --> 11:03.940
very tomboy-ish, but you're also going to look like a druggie, but nonetheless, like

11:03.940 --> 11:09.360
I feel for people who try their best to pass as the other gender and then they get insulted

11:09.360 --> 11:10.360
in public.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.740
Like that's probably a pretty rough feeling, you know?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.140
It's a pretty rude thing to do.

11:14.140 --> 11:19.100
This person though, all you've done is just throw on a baseball cap and a baggy sweater.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.540
In fact, you look kind of like my girlfriend when she's just lounging around the house.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.340
She doesn't have to dress up for anybody, you know?

11:24.340 --> 11:27.420
If you want to be gender as a man by the people, you have to look like one.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.720
All right guys, I've had my spicy ramen slow cooking this whole time.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.740
It's about ready, so it's time for me to go.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.100
Thanks for being here, everyone.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.100
I love you.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.780
Oh, and I'll see you tonight for Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.780
Maybe.

11:38.780 --> 11:39.780
Maybe not.

11:39.780 --> 11:40.280
I love you.
