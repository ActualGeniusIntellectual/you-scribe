00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,460
Hello friends, Dev here with you once again for TikTok Tuesday.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,640
It's a beautiful day out, there's been a huge storm in my region, it's finally passed.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,440
I don't know if you can hear those birds outside.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,480
It's a beautiful day, the forest has come alive once again, Naomi and I went out into

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,960
the city to do some errands, it's just been all in all a great day.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,620
About an extra hour or so between now and when we start streaming the new Star Wars

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,060
game tonight on the channel.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,560
So I'm settling down for lunch with a bowl of homemade spicy ramen and we're going to

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,340
look over some TikTok nonsense that you guys have DM'd me on Discord once again.

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,360
So thanks for that guys, I didn't want to live that long anyway.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,660
First things first, apparently there's a new TikTok challenge, this time eating the plastic

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,820
wrapping that comes with fruit roll ups.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,120
The fruit roll ups legal team just debunked a TikTok trend claiming the plastic wrapper

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
is edible.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,400
Who thought like, alright, you know I shouldn't be surprised, Tide Pod challenge, every other

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,820
challenge on the, I think I even did a video back in the day about all the dumb challenges

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,960
that people have done.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,140
The Nyquil chicken challenge, going viral on the internet is just retarded nowadays.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,860
Okay, Stitch with hollyberry09, legal is making me clarify you should not attempt to eat plastic

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,260
from the official fruit roll ups TikTok.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
I didn't know fruit roll ups had a TikTok.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Plastic doesn't freeze I'm pretty sure.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,700
What?

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Okay, there's no way.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Let's see.

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Alright, fresh out of the freezer.

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,700
Let's see.

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Let's see.

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,700
Um, she may be right.

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,700
Ooh.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Nope.

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Plastic.

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Why would you try this?

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,740
Like there are some dumb challenges out there, this one takes the cake.

35
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,380
Just eat the plastic, fuck it.

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,060
But if only everything else that you guys have sent me would be as wholesome as that.

37
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,560
Are you ready for the diarrhea?

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,220
I'm just here to take notes.

39
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,220
I take excellent notes.

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Alright, what are we taking notes on?

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,300
They've tried to extinguish tear gas canisters with water bottles using traffic cones and

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,020
metal bowls to snuff out the gas before it spreads.

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,820
Oh, how to protest.

44
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
How to be an antifin member.

45
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,280
On the front lines, many demonstrators wear makeshift armor.

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,760
They also show protesters forming human supply chains, some over one mile long.

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,360
And to communicate what supplies are needed, they use hand signals passed along the chain.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
Imagine having this much free time.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
In this video, protesters are asking for helmets.

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,240
Like I got too much stuff going on, man.

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Several videos show how the massive crowds part to allow ambulances free passage.

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,380
Oh wait, these are Hong Kong protests.

53
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,300
Protesters have adopted a strategy they're calling B-Water in order to evade the police.

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,020
It means that they move quickly rather than occupying a single location.

55
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,800
That's why it doesn't look like an antifa, actually.

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,340
So that's all interesting stuff.

57
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,780
But as you can see, it's much more organized because they're actually fighting a bad government.

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,780
That's not happening in the States.

59
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,180
You know, for all the bad stuff that, you know, America or Canada or the UK or any Western

60
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,220
nation might do, not as bad as China and the whole like, oh, I'm just taking down notes

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,740
that we can copy what they do over here.

62
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,160
It's like unnecessary, unwarranted.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,400
You want to reduce your participation in capitalism?

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
No I don't.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
You can move your money out of the for-profit banking system.

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,880
If you're in the US like me, you're probably using one of these four banks.

67
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,420
All of them are for-profit, which means they're extracting as much profit as they can from

68
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
your money.

69
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,320
The good news is that you can take your money out of this extractive system by banking with

70
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,080
a credit union or a nonprofit bank.

71
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,400
So as far as I understand, the difference between capitalism and socialism has nothing

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
to do with money.

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,440
It has everything to do with the worker's relationship to the means of production.

74
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,680
You don't change your relationship to the means of production by banking with a different

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
bank, right?

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Now credit unions are fine.

77
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,760
For those of you who don't know what a credit union is, it's basically, it offers the same

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,240
service as a bank, but it's a worker co-op bank basically.

79
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,360
But only kind of because it's the people who actually bank with it actually own part of

80
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,640
the company and they're nonprofit.

81
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,760
The issue ultimately with credit unions is that, and at least in my parents' experience

82
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,340
because they used one for a while, it was harder to get certain large-scale loans.

83
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,840
For example, if you want to get a mortgage so you can pay off a house or something, you

84
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
can get that from a bank.

85
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
It's much harder to get from a credit union.

86
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
They have their place in the market.

87
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,120
They're a good idea, but this idea that this is how you disengage from capitalism, nope.

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
That's not how it works, man.

89
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,820
Everything I'm going to mention has to do with building civic and institutional power.

90
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,080
It's all about numbers.

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,900
It's all about bonds, baby.

92
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,940
The bullet trained giga Chad's guide to dismantling capitalism.

93
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,920
These are all still anti-capitalist ones, guys.

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
What's this list here?

95
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,660
Propaganda, of course, is propaganda.

96
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
Harkens back to my Gramsci video.

97
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,100
Number one is propaganda.

98
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,060
We have got to control the narrative on the internet and IRL.

99
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,940
I don't care if it's music, videos, jokes, thought-provoking essays, performative memes,

100
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,340
man, all that shit.

101
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,100
Let this critique should be bleeding into even the most apolitical spaces on the internet.

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm talking makeup, vlogging, gaming.

103
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,500
Listen, listen, they don't want you to have any, any break from their politics.

104
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,300
Leftist critique needs to bleed into every single apolitical space.

105
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
No it fucking doesn't.

106
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,580
And in fact, when you see someone doing that shit, you just need to say, no, fuck you.

107
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,040
We're not here to talk about politics, but everything's fucking off.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,900
Number two, we need left leaning and sympathetic characters and institutions of power and media

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,060
to help facilitate and protect revolutionary action and help control the professional narrative.

110
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
Yep, there it is.

111
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,120
They just outright say it.

112
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,660
They need to put their plants into the institutions and then those people need to misuse the power

113
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,240
from their positions to push those politics.

114
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,480
That is something that we absolutely have to resist.

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,520
While we're at it, cut it with the anti-voting shit.

116
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
It makes no fucking sense.

117
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Good luck buddy.

118
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
It's not revolutionary action.

119
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Number three, no more label wars.

120
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
It's anti-praxis.

121
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,080
You're going to work with an ML.

122
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,780
You're going to work with an anarchist.

123
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
Get over it.

124
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780
We don't have to be a hive mind.

125
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,640
We just have to operate like one.

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,720
Dude, dude, you're going to work with an ML.

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,160
You're going to work with a Marxist Leninist.

128
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
This is the thing.

129
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
This is what left unity means.

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,520
It means basically the people who say, Oh, we're not like the tankies.

131
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
It's okay.

132
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
We're actually the good ones.

133
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,360
We're just like the Bernie Sanders sock dams or whatever the fuck.

134
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
No, no.

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,060
They're going to work with the MLS.

136
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,060
They're going to work with the market.

137
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
They're going to work with tankies.

138
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,060
They're going to Stalinist.

139
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
That's how it's going to be.

140
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
All right.

141
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
And you know what?

142
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,460
Within that leftist unity, the Stalinists being the most bloodthirsty, they will win

143
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,680
that internal fight.

144
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,980
This is why it always degenerates into this sort of authoritarianism.

145
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,420
Number four, no more USSR aesthetic, no more Molotov cocktail aesthetic.

146
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,420
This shit's lame.

147
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
We got a new one.

148
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,420
We're bullet train giga chats because fixing shit is awesome and ignoring problems is lame

149
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,540
and weak chain.

150
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
That's right.

151
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
That's right.

152
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
They're doing the whole bullet train thing.

153
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,300
It's like, how come every other country has, you know, bullet trains?

154
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Why can't America?

155
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Well, America's bigger than Germany.

156
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,820
America's bigger than Japan.

157
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,900
And also most people don't want to really go to the various internal States.

158
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,540
They want to go to Florida, Texas, New York, LA, and then like Washington state.

159
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,860
That's where most of the people who would use the bullet trains actually want to go.

160
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,260
They don't want to have a bullet train that goes across the United States.

161
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,620
There's just no demand for it, but that's their new aesthetic.

162
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,260
They're, uh, they're giving up the USSR aesthetic even as they side with Marxist Leninists.

163
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Okay.

164
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
We get it.

165
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,260
The subversiveness.

166
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
We get it.

167
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,540
Also, there's already so much anti-communist propaganda out there that it makes it really

168
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,900
fucking hard to radicalize people when they're already turned off by the symbolism.

169
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,560
And of course, this is the same thing.

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,200
Their radicalism good, their enemies' radicalism bad.

171
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,720
The truth is no one's radicalism is good.

172
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,680
Number five, if you can't boil down theory so that liberals, normies, and baby leftist

173
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
can latch onto it, stay out of the agitprop game.

174
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You're not helping as much as you think you are.

175
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,520
And at some point it gets pretty counterproductive when all you're doing is beating other leftists

176
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,580
over the head with the amount of books you've read.

177
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,440
Keep doing that shit.

178
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,920
Dude, their theory is so fucking stupid.

179
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,800
No one has ever actually made the theory digestible because the theory does not map onto reality.

180
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
All right.

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,720
That's the hard truth of it.

182
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
This shit don't work.

183
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,280
Number six, it's time to rebuild community cohesion.

184
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,700
Start a block party, invite your neighbors over, maybe discuss a few local policies like

185
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,660
the potholes or the speed trap at the end of your neighbor.

186
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,640
Build friendships with your coworkers and agitate unionization in your workplace.

187
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,960
Uplift some motherfuckers, engage in mutual aid.

188
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,120
People are more likely to help you if you help them.

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,320
The funniest part about that is that if these people actually did that, they would recognize

190
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,440
just how conservative the working class around them actually is.

191
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,360
Yeah, some of them might be okay with unions.

192
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,040
Some of them might want the potholes to be fixed.

193
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,280
But as soon as you talk about cultural issues, as soon as you talk about, let's say religion,

194
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,980
they are going to have opinions that you don't like.

195
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,880
And that natural reflex to purity spiral is going to kick right in.

196
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,000
This shit always falls apart.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,920
Moreover, man, I have a friend group already.

198
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,080
I don't really want to get involved with the local community around me.

199
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,380
You know that old phrase, tall fences make good neighbors?

200
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,760
This whole idea just bleeds into the, we should be in each other's business more.

201
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,260
And I just don't agree with that.

202
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,200
My neighbors have no right to know what I do in the privacy of my own life.

203
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,480
And I have no right to know what they do.

204
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
My community is not the people who live in my street.

205
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
It's certainly not, by the way, back when you used to work like a normie job, it's certainly

206
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
not my coworkers.

207
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,400
Fuck, I never want to see any of them ever again.

208
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Fuck.

209
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,720
The minute I punched out, I was out of there.

210
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Fuck those people.

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,400
I don't want to bring politics into my, you know, normie friend space.

212
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Fuck that.

213
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,660
Number seven, protests and demonstrations have got to be a confederation of organizations.

214
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,800
From what I've seen from my IRL, these things go way smoother when we have a division of

215
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
labor.

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,280
Picture this with me for a second.

217
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,340
One huge decentralized mass equating the strength in numbers, a division of labor groups responsible

218
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,920
for medical protection, legal resources, oh, division of labor, dude.

219
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,660
That doesn't, that doesn't really jive with what Marx is writing about.

220
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,340
These people are like delusional.

221
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,860
They're fucking delusional.

222
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,620
This shit's never going down.

223
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,820
This one's got music, hold on.

224
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,820
This one's got music.

225
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Hold on.

226
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,580
Maybe I'll just, I'll turn off the music here real quick and we'll play it again.

227
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,420
It seems like there's only text though.

228
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,380
If you're a cis gay or lesbian and refuse to date trans folk, you're transphobic.

229
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,260
Your genitalia preference is as weird and colonizer as fuck.

230
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,060
Is this one of the trans cells where this person's angry that like a lesbian who, you

231
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,460
know, only wants women with vaginas won't date her because she has a penis?

232
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
Is that what this is?

233
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,340
Imagine being so entitled that you think that you can just have sex with people and if they

234
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,700
won't you call them bigoted.

235
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,900
The concept of consent just flies out the window with these people as soon as it's them

236
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
being told no.

237
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:40,140
I, uh, made a joke on Twitter a few weeks ago that the incel uprising is actually happening.

238
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,620
It's just happening with a bunch of trans maxers now.

239
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
I...

240
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Non-binary range.

241
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Oh my God.

242
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
A lady.

243
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
You're not?

244
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Not a fucking...

245
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,620
I see boobs though.

246
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,820
Hold on, let's watch that again.

247
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,620
I'm not a lady, but you have a face of a girl, you have the hair of a girl, like you look

248
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,940
very tomboy-ish, but you're also going to look like a druggie, but nonetheless, like

249
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,360
I feel for people who try their best to pass as the other gender and then they get insulted

250
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
in public.

251
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,740
Like that's probably a pretty rough feeling, you know?

252
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,140
It's a pretty rude thing to do.

253
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,100
This person though, all you've done is just throw on a baseball cap and a baggy sweater.

254
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,540
In fact, you look kind of like my girlfriend when she's just lounging around the house.

255
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,340
She doesn't have to dress up for anybody, you know?

256
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,420
If you want to be gender as a man by the people, you have to look like one.

257
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,720
All right guys, I've had my spicy ramen slow cooking this whole time.

258
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,740
It's about ready, so it's time for me to go.

259
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,100
Thanks for being here, everyone.

260
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
I love you.

261
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,780
Oh, and I'll see you tonight for Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.

262
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Maybe.

263
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
Maybe not.

264
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,280
I love you.
