1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,040
People just love to talk about accessibility in video games.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
And I get it.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,920
Wouldn't it suck to be blind, or some kind of clawed half-man creature, and not be able

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
to hold a controller?

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,800
You wouldn't be able to experience the mountain of quality video games that exist out there.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,360
Specialized controllers for people who don't have normal hands seems to be a fine idea

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
to me.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,520
Though, in actuality, they end up just being fight sticks, or sometimes altered controllers

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,600
that put all the button presses under one hand.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
But hey, it works!

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,800
There's also a vest that deaf people can wear that translates in-game sound effects

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
into vibrations, too.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
That's really cool!

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,600
And a lot of games are including colorblind options.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,260
For example, the green, blue, purple, orange-tier coloring for common, rare, epic, and legendary

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,840
items has been in use since, I think, Diablo.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,300
And I recall games even as old as Borderlands 2 having colorblind options to make that sort

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,720
of thing stand out a little bit better for people who are colorblind.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,320
But the practical reality is, some games just can't be adapted to work with every single

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
disability.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,400
Sometimes, somebody with partial blindness, but who can still see bright things, will

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,040
still be able to play a game if it's set up in a mode where contrast is turned up or

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,080
something like that.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,760
But a horror game that relies on squinting into the darkness, or subtle movements in

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,900
the distance, there's just no way to bridge that gap without ruining the feel of things.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,640
It sounds funny to say it, but we often forget just how debilitating disabilities are.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,280
We should try to accommodate people, but we should also understand that our ability to

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,720
accommodate has its limits.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,520
And if there are some gaps that are just too big to bridge, it's nobody's fault.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,800
Not the disabled persons, not the game developers.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
That's just life.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
There you go.

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,880
I've just given you the whole of the accessibility in games position that is actually reasonable,

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,000
and not mired in progressive bullshit.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,160
Getting past this point is going to be nonsense.

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Strap yourselves in.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,140
I wouldn't want you to get whiplash and have to play your games in a neck brace.

38
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,680
In 2010, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act was passed in the

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
United States.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,760
As reported on DualShockers.com, it's a piece of general purpose legislation that requires

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,040
accessibility concerns addressed in all advanced communication services.

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,640
The gaming industry is affected only insofar as voice chat, text chat, and video chat in

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
online games are concerned.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,080
And due to technology not being there in 2010, the gaming industry was given several

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
extensions up to January 1st, 2019 to implement changes.

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,000
Now if you were hyper-tuned into the culture war back then, like for example our old spurgy

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
pal Billy from One Angry Gamer, you might believe that Big Brother Government was going

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,120
to dumb down all of our games such that the hardest mode possible would only be fit for

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,280
a doped-up Dean Takahashi.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,680
But that's what you get for only reading the headlines and not actually checking out

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,040
the legislation involved.

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,640
I guess this is why you sold OAG, eh Billy?

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,200
However, despite this being a joke position, progressives have actually taken the position

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
up.

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,520
A lot of progs like to repurpose the accessibility angle in order to push for stuff that actually

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,000
has nothing to do with helping the disabled.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,900
And everything to do with dumbing things down, rounding the corners, making everything brightly

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,840
colored and identifiable, and catering to everybody's most specific tastes, no matter

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,720
how ridiculous and demanding they are.

60
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,120
The dear girl from the last video over on Twitch?

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,520
Yeah, she thinks that voice chat is inherently a non-inclusive game mechanic, not only because

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,800
some people are mute, but because some trans people don't have passing voices.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,200
Also, the person giving out the deer-gasms in that cringe video clip I played for you,

64
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,680
that I played twice, believes in this position so strongly that she's willing to insult

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,980
people's dyslexia over it.

66
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,840
Being ableist in your advocacy for disabilities.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Good job.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,340
Sorry, had to do it.

69
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,700
But most famously of all, the progs are using accessibility as an excuse to backdoor in

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,480
a general lowering of difficulty in games.

71
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,000
Because I guess not being able to get fucking good as a disability now?

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When Sekiro came out back in 2019, game journos who couldn't beat the game, or hell, get

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,160
beyond the first hour, started dropping articles talking about accessibility, when what they

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,120
were actually talking about was difficulty.

75
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,420
Yes, even in the article whose headline blatantly says it's not about difficulty, it's actually

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,920
about difficulty too if you were to read it.

77
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,160
We saw viral tweets and articles like this, if the entire point of your video game rests

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,720
on the player's ability to perform fast-click challenges and precision jumping in bullshit

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,240
mechanic gimmicks, then you aren't telling a good story, you're making bop it for grownups.

80
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,960
Anyone who ever uses the word gameplay needs to seriously consider their life choices.

81
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,780
Now that Ubisoft's opened the door, can we have our skip boss fight button?

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,880
Why Dark Souls 3 should have an easy mode, and the problem with playing to win?

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,040
Twitch streamers are sick of being shamed for playing a game on easy.

84
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,800
Oh shut the fuck up, I'm shamed all the time on my stream, that's part of the fun.

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,520
As streamers, we're dancing monkeys, and if that means that sometimes you're the butt

86
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,760
of the joke, that's how it is, you hypersensitive art hoe.

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,360
Also, watch Game Boomers already you cucks.

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,400
That last article is Patricia Hernandez's most recent abortion published on Polygon,

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
and it's in reference to this video.

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,080
Hi friends, I want you to look right in my eyes right now, you know exactly who I'm talking

91
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
to.

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,320
Hi, shut the fuck up, let people play games however they want to, are you seriously roasting

93
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,380
me for trying to play a story that is notoriously one of the most convoluted lore-based games

94
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,060
in existence to try to figure out the lore and listen to the dialogue and watch the cutscenes

95
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,380
and enjoy it?

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,020
I swear to god, I swear to god, not everybody wants to play games to be absolutely infuriated

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,660
and in pain the entire time.

98
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,620
I will absolutely suplex you the fuck out of my chat, stop gatekeeping how people play

99
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,620
games, it's so fucking boring, you're boring!

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,340
I wonder what kind of worldview you have to have to think that you're boring is a proper

101
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,940
reply to getting blown the fuck out.

102
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,820
I know at least two breadtubers who say that on the regular, and it's like damn dude, the

103
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,740
rest of the world doesn't exist for your entertainment.

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,860
In fact, if you're on stream it's the way around, you're the boring one for bitching

105
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,020
that your chat is having a good time laughing at you, and if you don't want to be laughed

106
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,220
at, get good.

107
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,460
This tiktok also went viral a couple months ago, and it's cut from the same cloth.

108
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,880
Side note, we are not hating on people that make video games a priority.

109
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,980
If being good at video games is one of your priorities, what an excellent way to spend

110
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,980
your downtime, I am flabbergasted by your skills.

111
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,500
It's just not one of my priorities, I have many skills in this life, but beating Hollow

112
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,420
Knight mini-bosses is not one of them.

113
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,660
I don't want a challenge, life is hard enough, I want a cool interactive story.

114
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,260
What happens is I get frustrated on a fight I can't beat, and I end up giving up and

115
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,220
I lose out on so much cool stories.

116
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,060
Video game creators, this is my plea to you.

117
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,380
Slash slash, on with the story.

118
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,140
Easy modes, please, thank you.

119
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,440
Holy shit, did we need this one to be an angry feminist rages in the car flavor?

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,660
The problem with the position presented in these two videos is that it completely backfires

121
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,660
when you put it together with another prog talking point.

122
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,940
Not everything has to be for everybody.

123
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,940
Which is true.

124
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,860
For example, High Guardian Spice is not for me, it's for the chromosomally deficient

125
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,780
who think that Steven Universe or BoJack Horseman were actually good shows, but that's fine,

126
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,820
not everything's for me, not everything is to my taste, but it doesn't have to be.

127
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,780
And it also doesn't have to be for the adult infants who can't beat Hollow Knight either.

128
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,060
I have many skills in this life, but beating Hollow Knight mini-bosses is not one of them.

129
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,200
Guess what, lady, Hollow Knight's not for you.

130
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,980
And that's okay, there are other games you can play.

131
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,780
Progs always hide their it's not meant for you card when something is not to their taste.

132
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,300
Because the truth is, they want everything to be meant for them.

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,920
Their thought process is, hey, here's something popular, like Hollow Knight, like Sekiro,

134
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
like Dark Souls 3.

135
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,760
It's in the current cultural zeitgeist.

136
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,080
I want to be able to tweet about it while it's still relevant, but it's actually not

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
my thing.

138
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,840
Therefore, I'm excluded, and exclusion is a social justice problem, and so the solution

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,160
is to change it to be something that I like.

140
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,520
It's a related medical condition to the Netflix adaptation tumor, called the Easy Mode Lesions.

141
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,520
In fact, if you only want to watch a game, then go watch a stream or a let's play or

142
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,600
a fucking movie adaptation, I don't know.

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,480
Hell, Shenmue is getting an anime.

144
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,080
That game will probably even be better as an anime, just go watch that.

145
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,040
Of course, if this is the way that customers want it, or rather, if game developers think

146
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,200
that this is the way that customers want it based on an annoyingly loud minority online,

147
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,280
they're going to start implementing shit that Sony revealed as part of its PS5 accessibility

148
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
microtransactions.

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,800
Imagine approaching a boss during a game, and you suddenly get this popup.

150
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Players who used Resource E were successful on their first attempt 80% of the time and

151
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,940
defeated Boss X in about 1 minute on average.

152
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,280
Expect Resource E now, with Resource E costing a buck or two on the PlayStation Store.

153
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,220
I remember people ridiculing this shit back in the 2000s.

154
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,660
In fact, I booted up Mass Effect 3 on my old Xbox 360 because I'm playing through it

155
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,660
on stream right now, and still available on Xbox Live.

156
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,980
On the 360, even now, for this decade old game, are $5.99 gun packs to unlock super

157
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,640
strong weapons not available during normal play.

158
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,500
We made fun of this shit back in the day, and rightly so, and now it's going to be

159
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,380
pop-ups right in the game.

160
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,540
Speaking of microtransactions, what the fresh hell is this?

161
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Alright, alright, let's see.

162
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,860
Subtitles are of course useful for deaf and hard of hearing players, while colorblindness

163
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,300
modes have been an increasingly common feature in games.

164
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
There.

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,260
I've played the only good part of this 20 minute Jim Sterling video for you.

166
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,340
That was the only good point made.

167
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,840
Everything else is listening to that cat bell jingle while the two of them try to deliver

168
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
their lines.

169
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,880
Why are you wearing a collar?

170
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,440
Something else in this video is just complaints about how microtransactions are evil, and

171
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,280
they certainly can be, but how they're also ableist, because people with certain disabilities

172
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,000
just can't control themselves, and have to spend spend spend on loot boxes and other

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
shit.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,480
And sure, for some people, that's probably true, but for a lot of others, I think it's

175
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,600
just people externalizing their lack of discipline, blaming some other variable so they don't

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
have to own up to the possibility that they need to work on themselves.

177
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,840
In a moment that shames me, I once idly spent money on pocket fucking mortys without really

178
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,100
thinking about what I was doing.

179
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,460
My impulsiveness and my lack of patience for the grinding and randomization made me toss

180
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,680
some money to get more of the dribblingly and unsatisfyingly unlockable playable mortys,

181
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,580
and I didn't even think about how I was buying loot boxes until immediately afterwards, where

182
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,660
my brain actually caught up and said, wait a minute, my lack of self control as a result

183
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,460
of simply not thinking is genuinely scary to me.

184
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,660
This is like saying it's McDonald's fault that you got fat.

185
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,340
No, just stop fucking eating it, dude.

186
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,180
Truth be told, the accessibility discourse in gaming is the most disingenuous bullshit

187
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
I've ever heard.

188
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,380
If progs actually cared about the disabled, the conversation wouldn't revolve around

189
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,940
easy modes, but would instead focus on things like the lack of colorblind settings in most

190
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,260
games, or the pain of getting specialized controllers or interfaces to work on some

191
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,060
platforms, most notably PS4 and PS5 right now.

192
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,760
Yet, whenever they bring up the accessibility issue, it's never actually about disabled

193
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,300
people because they do not give a shit about disabilities, and in fact, are very happy

194
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,580
to be ableist if it serves their interests, as I've covered in another video.

195
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,100
They only talk about difficulty, and they use the disabled as a shield for their own

196
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
lack of skill.

197
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,780
It was a recent story that Double Fine put an invincibility toggle in Psychonauts 2.

198
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,740
Not an optional invincibility powerup like in the more recent Mario games, but a straight

199
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,920
up, turn it on in the menu, you're now invincible.

200
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,640
And Tim Schafer decided to characterize his critics like this, uh, excuse me, I beat sword

201
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,540
guy serious time on a no hit hard mode, and if you didn't do that, I don't respect

202
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
you.

203
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,620
And like, can you even comment on things if you're not Diamond 6 rank in shooty mcblam?

204
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
I don't think so.

205
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,140
Cool bud, you're so cool.

206
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,100
Now, if Tim Schafer wasn't a walking turn up, but actually knew how to appeal to his

207
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,460
primary fanbase, which at this point is only people who have fond memories of Psychonauts

208
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,940
1, here is what he should have done.

209
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,860
He should have put in an invincibility mode as a cheat code.

210
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,860
There you go.

211
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,680
Now the boomers who are aching for a taste of when games were once good, get some nostalgia

212
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,500
in the form of the return of cheat codes.

213
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,340
And now these pretend accessibility advocates get to put something in their shitty Kotaku

214
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,720
article that nobody will read.

215
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,860
But it seems like Tim Schafer would rather shit his pants at people who actually want

216
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,420
to play the game he's created.

217
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,660
Also, excuse me, but um, shooty mcblam?

218
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,340
Using a mick like that as a slur against the Irish I'll have you know, progs need to

219
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,420
stop abusing the term accessibility to mean consuming the raw content of a video game

220
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,220
easily and without any sort of roadblock whatsoever.

221
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
But they won't.

222
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,260
Because that would mean giving up the ethical grounding upon which their own subjective

223
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,700
tastes and consumption patterns rest upon.

224
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,820
Without that, they'd have to admit that it really is just a matter of personal preference,

225
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,540
and that the onus really is on them to get good.

226
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,480
But that means personal responsibility, and turning your own individual inadequacies into

227
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,540
a social issue is a great way of blaming everybody else for your own bullshit.

228
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,580
I'm not even against the people who use the invincibility mode or whatever, I just

229
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
won't use it.

230
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
That's fine.

231
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,540
But one, banter is still legitimate, and just like in the old days, if you play on

232
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,120
easy, yeah, laughing at you is fine.

233
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Laughing at me is fine too.

234
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,620
Yes you're a big kid, that's the point.

235
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,900
And two, we all know where this eventually leads, don't we?

236
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,060
Superhot went from having a really cool game with some admittedly dark components, mainly

237
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,600
suicide and brain alteration, to having a toggle to remove those dark components despite

238
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,500
them being essential to the story, to just outright removing them for everybody in the

239
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,780
name of accessibility.

240
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,580
It won't stop with the inclusion of easy modes, but the exclusion of hard modes.

241
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,420
Mass Effect Legendary Edition was already significantly easier on its hardest difficulties

242
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,500
than the original game.

243
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,260
The Grand Theft Auto trilogy re-release also seems to be similarly rebalanced.

244
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,700
This is only going to continue unless you start voting with your wallets.

245
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,180
Probably the most disgusting part of it all, though, is how these people co-op those with

246
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,300
actual real physical needs because they're tired of being made fun for being DSP clones.

247
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,820
This is like if a guy in a wheelchair said, I need a ramp to enter the building, and then

248
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,540
the city government spent six figures on a public education campaign, put up billboards

249
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,060
and signs everywhere, ran TV and radio ads promoting the plight of the disabled, donated

250
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,540
huge sums to the advocacy group People United for Ramps in America, collected research on

251
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,940
the opinion of violent anti-ramp groups, and then when the guy in the wheelchair once again

252
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,340
just asked to have a ramp built, he would be arrested for harassing and threatening

253
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:55,140
city officials as part of the alt-right gamergate fascist group We Won't Wheel.
