00:00.000 --> 00:16.040
People just love to talk about accessibility in video games.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
And I get it.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.920
Wouldn't it suck to be blind, or some kind of clawed half-man creature, and not be able

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
to hold a controller?

00:21.920 --> 00:25.800
You wouldn't be able to experience the mountain of quality video games that exist out there.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.360
Specialized controllers for people who don't have normal hands seems to be a fine idea

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
to me.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.520
Though, in actuality, they end up just being fight sticks, or sometimes altered controllers

00:34.520 --> 00:36.600
that put all the button presses under one hand.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.600
But hey, it works!

00:37.600 --> 00:41.800
There's also a vest that deaf people can wear that translates in-game sound effects

00:41.800 --> 00:42.800
into vibrations, too.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
That's really cool!

00:43.800 --> 00:46.600
And a lot of games are including colorblind options.

00:46.600 --> 00:52.260
For example, the green, blue, purple, orange-tier coloring for common, rare, epic, and legendary

00:52.260 --> 00:55.840
items has been in use since, I think, Diablo.

00:55.840 --> 01:01.300
And I recall games even as old as Borderlands 2 having colorblind options to make that sort

01:01.300 --> 01:03.720
of thing stand out a little bit better for people who are colorblind.

01:03.720 --> 01:08.320
But the practical reality is, some games just can't be adapted to work with every single

01:08.320 --> 01:09.320
disability.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.400
Sometimes, somebody with partial blindness, but who can still see bright things, will

01:13.400 --> 01:17.040
still be able to play a game if it's set up in a mode where contrast is turned up or

01:17.040 --> 01:18.080
something like that.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.760
But a horror game that relies on squinting into the darkness, or subtle movements in

01:21.760 --> 01:26.900
the distance, there's just no way to bridge that gap without ruining the feel of things.

01:26.900 --> 01:31.640
It sounds funny to say it, but we often forget just how debilitating disabilities are.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.280
We should try to accommodate people, but we should also understand that our ability to

01:35.280 --> 01:36.720
accommodate has its limits.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.520
And if there are some gaps that are just too big to bridge, it's nobody's fault.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.800
Not the disabled persons, not the game developers.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
That's just life.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
There you go.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.880
I've just given you the whole of the accessibility in games position that is actually reasonable,

01:48.880 --> 01:51.000
and not mired in progressive bullshit.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.160
Getting past this point is going to be nonsense.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.160
Strap yourselves in.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.140
I wouldn't want you to get whiplash and have to play your games in a neck brace.

01:57.140 --> 02:01.680
In 2010, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act was passed in the

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
United States.

02:02.680 --> 02:07.760
As reported on DualShockers.com, it's a piece of general purpose legislation that requires

02:07.760 --> 02:12.040
accessibility concerns addressed in all advanced communication services.

02:12.040 --> 02:16.640
The gaming industry is affected only insofar as voice chat, text chat, and video chat in

02:16.640 --> 02:17.920
online games are concerned.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.080
And due to technology not being there in 2010, the gaming industry was given several

02:22.080 --> 02:25.760
extensions up to January 1st, 2019 to implement changes.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.000
Now if you were hyper-tuned into the culture war back then, like for example our old spurgy

02:30.000 --> 02:33.840
pal Billy from One Angry Gamer, you might believe that Big Brother Government was going

02:33.840 --> 02:38.120
to dumb down all of our games such that the hardest mode possible would only be fit for

02:38.120 --> 02:40.280
a doped-up Dean Takahashi.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.680
But that's what you get for only reading the headlines and not actually checking out

02:43.680 --> 02:45.040
the legislation involved.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.640
I guess this is why you sold OAG, eh Billy?

02:47.680 --> 02:52.200
However, despite this being a joke position, progressives have actually taken the position

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
up.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.520
A lot of progs like to repurpose the accessibility angle in order to push for stuff that actually

02:56.520 --> 02:58.000
has nothing to do with helping the disabled.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.900
And everything to do with dumbing things down, rounding the corners, making everything brightly

03:01.900 --> 03:05.840
colored and identifiable, and catering to everybody's most specific tastes, no matter

03:05.840 --> 03:07.720
how ridiculous and demanding they are.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.120
The dear girl from the last video over on Twitch?

03:10.120 --> 03:15.520
Yeah, she thinks that voice chat is inherently a non-inclusive game mechanic, not only because

03:15.520 --> 03:19.800
some people are mute, but because some trans people don't have passing voices.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.200
Also, the person giving out the deer-gasms in that cringe video clip I played for you,

03:24.200 --> 03:28.680
that I played twice, believes in this position so strongly that she's willing to insult

03:28.680 --> 03:30.980
people's dyslexia over it.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.840
Being ableist in your advocacy for disabilities.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.840
Good job.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.340
Sorry, had to do it.

03:38.340 --> 03:42.700
But most famously of all, the progs are using accessibility as an excuse to backdoor in

03:42.700 --> 03:45.480
a general lowering of difficulty in games.

03:45.480 --> 03:49.000
Because I guess not being able to get fucking good as a disability now?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
When Sekiro came out back in 2019, game journos who couldn't beat the game, or hell, get

03:53.000 --> 03:57.160
beyond the first hour, started dropping articles talking about accessibility, when what they

03:57.160 --> 03:59.120
were actually talking about was difficulty.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.420
Yes, even in the article whose headline blatantly says it's not about difficulty, it's actually

04:03.420 --> 04:04.920
about difficulty too if you were to read it.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.160
We saw viral tweets and articles like this, if the entire point of your video game rests

04:09.160 --> 04:13.720
on the player's ability to perform fast-click challenges and precision jumping in bullshit

04:13.720 --> 04:18.240
mechanic gimmicks, then you aren't telling a good story, you're making bop it for grownups.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.960
Anyone who ever uses the word gameplay needs to seriously consider their life choices.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.780
Now that Ubisoft's opened the door, can we have our skip boss fight button?

04:26.780 --> 04:30.880
Why Dark Souls 3 should have an easy mode, and the problem with playing to win?

04:30.880 --> 04:34.040
Twitch streamers are sick of being shamed for playing a game on easy.

04:34.040 --> 04:38.800
Oh shut the fuck up, I'm shamed all the time on my stream, that's part of the fun.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.520
As streamers, we're dancing monkeys, and if that means that sometimes you're the butt

04:42.520 --> 04:45.760
of the joke, that's how it is, you hypersensitive art hoe.

05:12.520 --> 05:18.360
Also, watch Game Boomers already you cucks.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.400
That last article is Patricia Hernandez's most recent abortion published on Polygon,

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
and it's in reference to this video.

05:24.400 --> 05:29.080
Hi friends, I want you to look right in my eyes right now, you know exactly who I'm talking

05:29.080 --> 05:30.080
to.

05:30.080 --> 05:35.320
Hi, shut the fuck up, let people play games however they want to, are you seriously roasting

05:35.320 --> 05:41.380
me for trying to play a story that is notoriously one of the most convoluted lore-based games

05:41.380 --> 05:45.060
in existence to try to figure out the lore and listen to the dialogue and watch the cutscenes

05:45.060 --> 05:46.380
and enjoy it?

05:46.380 --> 05:53.020
I swear to god, I swear to god, not everybody wants to play games to be absolutely infuriated

05:53.020 --> 05:58.660
and in pain the entire time.

05:58.660 --> 06:04.620
I will absolutely suplex you the fuck out of my chat, stop gatekeeping how people play

06:04.620 --> 06:07.620
games, it's so fucking boring, you're boring!

06:07.620 --> 06:11.340
I wonder what kind of worldview you have to have to think that you're boring is a proper

06:11.340 --> 06:12.940
reply to getting blown the fuck out.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.820
I know at least two breadtubers who say that on the regular, and it's like damn dude, the

06:16.820 --> 06:18.740
rest of the world doesn't exist for your entertainment.

06:18.740 --> 06:21.860
In fact, if you're on stream it's the way around, you're the boring one for bitching

06:21.860 --> 06:25.020
that your chat is having a good time laughing at you, and if you don't want to be laughed

06:25.020 --> 06:26.220
at, get good.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.460
This tiktok also went viral a couple months ago, and it's cut from the same cloth.

06:56.220 --> 06:58.880
Side note, we are not hating on people that make video games a priority.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.980
If being good at video games is one of your priorities, what an excellent way to spend

07:01.980 --> 07:03.980
your downtime, I am flabbergasted by your skills.

07:03.980 --> 07:07.500
It's just not one of my priorities, I have many skills in this life, but beating Hollow

07:07.500 --> 07:09.420
Knight mini-bosses is not one of them.

07:09.420 --> 07:13.660
I don't want a challenge, life is hard enough, I want a cool interactive story.

07:13.660 --> 07:17.260
What happens is I get frustrated on a fight I can't beat, and I end up giving up and

07:17.260 --> 07:20.220
I lose out on so much cool stories.

07:20.220 --> 07:23.060
Video game creators, this is my plea to you.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.380
Slash slash, on with the story.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.140
Easy modes, please, thank you.

07:29.140 --> 07:33.440
Holy shit, did we need this one to be an angry feminist rages in the car flavor?

07:33.440 --> 07:37.660
The problem with the position presented in these two videos is that it completely backfires

07:37.660 --> 07:40.660
when you put it together with another prog talking point.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.940
Not everything has to be for everybody.

07:42.940 --> 07:43.940
Which is true.

07:43.940 --> 07:47.860
For example, High Guardian Spice is not for me, it's for the chromosomally deficient

07:47.860 --> 07:51.780
who think that Steven Universe or BoJack Horseman were actually good shows, but that's fine,

07:51.780 --> 07:55.820
not everything's for me, not everything is to my taste, but it doesn't have to be.

07:55.820 --> 07:59.780
And it also doesn't have to be for the adult infants who can't beat Hollow Knight either.

07:59.780 --> 08:04.060
I have many skills in this life, but beating Hollow Knight mini-bosses is not one of them.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.200
Guess what, lady, Hollow Knight's not for you.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.980
And that's okay, there are other games you can play.

08:08.980 --> 08:13.780
Progs always hide their it's not meant for you card when something is not to their taste.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.300
Because the truth is, they want everything to be meant for them.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.920
Their thought process is, hey, here's something popular, like Hollow Knight, like Sekiro,

08:20.920 --> 08:21.920
like Dark Souls 3.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.760
It's in the current cultural zeitgeist.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.080
I want to be able to tweet about it while it's still relevant, but it's actually not

08:27.080 --> 08:28.080
my thing.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.840
Therefore, I'm excluded, and exclusion is a social justice problem, and so the solution

08:32.840 --> 08:35.160
is to change it to be something that I like.

08:35.160 --> 08:40.520
It's a related medical condition to the Netflix adaptation tumor, called the Easy Mode Lesions.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.520
In fact, if you only want to watch a game, then go watch a stream or a let's play or

08:44.520 --> 08:46.600
a fucking movie adaptation, I don't know.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.480
Hell, Shenmue is getting an anime.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.080
That game will probably even be better as an anime, just go watch that.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.040
Of course, if this is the way that customers want it, or rather, if game developers think

08:55.040 --> 08:59.200
that this is the way that customers want it based on an annoyingly loud minority online,

08:59.200 --> 09:03.280
they're going to start implementing shit that Sony revealed as part of its PS5 accessibility

09:03.280 --> 09:04.280
microtransactions.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.800
Imagine approaching a boss during a game, and you suddenly get this popup.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.800
Players who used Resource E were successful on their first attempt 80% of the time and

09:11.800 --> 09:14.940
defeated Boss X in about 1 minute on average.

09:14.940 --> 09:19.280
Expect Resource E now, with Resource E costing a buck or two on the PlayStation Store.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.220
I remember people ridiculing this shit back in the 2000s.

09:22.220 --> 09:26.660
In fact, I booted up Mass Effect 3 on my old Xbox 360 because I'm playing through it

09:26.660 --> 09:29.660
on stream right now, and still available on Xbox Live.

09:29.660 --> 09:34.980
On the 360, even now, for this decade old game, are $5.99 gun packs to unlock super

09:34.980 --> 09:37.640
strong weapons not available during normal play.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.500
We made fun of this shit back in the day, and rightly so, and now it's going to be

09:41.500 --> 09:43.380
pop-ups right in the game.

09:43.380 --> 09:46.540
Speaking of microtransactions, what the fresh hell is this?

09:46.540 --> 09:48.540
Alright, alright, let's see.

09:48.540 --> 09:52.860
Subtitles are of course useful for deaf and hard of hearing players, while colorblindness

09:52.860 --> 09:56.300
modes have been an increasingly common feature in games.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.300
There.

09:57.300 --> 10:01.260
I've played the only good part of this 20 minute Jim Sterling video for you.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.340
That was the only good point made.

10:03.340 --> 10:06.840
Everything else is listening to that cat bell jingle while the two of them try to deliver

10:06.840 --> 10:07.840
their lines.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.880
Why are you wearing a collar?

10:10.880 --> 10:14.440
Something else in this video is just complaints about how microtransactions are evil, and

10:14.440 --> 10:18.280
they certainly can be, but how they're also ableist, because people with certain disabilities

10:18.280 --> 10:22.000
just can't control themselves, and have to spend spend spend on loot boxes and other

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
shit.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.480
And sure, for some people, that's probably true, but for a lot of others, I think it's

10:25.480 --> 10:29.600
just people externalizing their lack of discipline, blaming some other variable so they don't

10:29.600 --> 10:32.240
have to own up to the possibility that they need to work on themselves.

10:32.240 --> 10:37.840
In a moment that shames me, I once idly spent money on pocket fucking mortys without really

10:37.840 --> 10:40.100
thinking about what I was doing.

10:40.100 --> 10:44.460
My impulsiveness and my lack of patience for the grinding and randomization made me toss

10:44.460 --> 10:49.680
some money to get more of the dribblingly and unsatisfyingly unlockable playable mortys,

10:49.680 --> 10:55.580
and I didn't even think about how I was buying loot boxes until immediately afterwards, where

10:55.580 --> 11:00.660
my brain actually caught up and said, wait a minute, my lack of self control as a result

11:00.660 --> 11:04.460
of simply not thinking is genuinely scary to me.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.660
This is like saying it's McDonald's fault that you got fat.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.340
No, just stop fucking eating it, dude.

11:08.340 --> 11:12.180
Truth be told, the accessibility discourse in gaming is the most disingenuous bullshit

11:12.180 --> 11:13.180
I've ever heard.

11:13.180 --> 11:16.380
If progs actually cared about the disabled, the conversation wouldn't revolve around

11:16.380 --> 11:19.940
easy modes, but would instead focus on things like the lack of colorblind settings in most

11:19.940 --> 11:23.260
games, or the pain of getting specialized controllers or interfaces to work on some

11:23.260 --> 11:26.060
platforms, most notably PS4 and PS5 right now.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.760
Yet, whenever they bring up the accessibility issue, it's never actually about disabled

11:29.760 --> 11:34.300
people because they do not give a shit about disabilities, and in fact, are very happy

11:34.300 --> 11:37.580
to be ableist if it serves their interests, as I've covered in another video.

11:37.580 --> 11:41.100
They only talk about difficulty, and they use the disabled as a shield for their own

11:41.100 --> 11:42.100
lack of skill.

11:42.100 --> 11:46.780
It was a recent story that Double Fine put an invincibility toggle in Psychonauts 2.

11:46.780 --> 11:50.740
Not an optional invincibility powerup like in the more recent Mario games, but a straight

11:50.740 --> 11:52.920
up, turn it on in the menu, you're now invincible.

11:52.920 --> 11:57.640
And Tim Schafer decided to characterize his critics like this, uh, excuse me, I beat sword

11:57.640 --> 12:01.540
guy serious time on a no hit hard mode, and if you didn't do that, I don't respect

12:01.540 --> 12:02.540
you.

12:02.540 --> 12:05.620
And like, can you even comment on things if you're not Diamond 6 rank in shooty mcblam?

12:05.620 --> 12:06.620
I don't think so.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.140
Cool bud, you're so cool.

12:08.140 --> 12:12.100
Now, if Tim Schafer wasn't a walking turn up, but actually knew how to appeal to his

12:12.100 --> 12:16.460
primary fanbase, which at this point is only people who have fond memories of Psychonauts

12:16.460 --> 12:17.940
1, here is what he should have done.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.860
He should have put in an invincibility mode as a cheat code.

12:20.860 --> 12:21.860
There you go.

12:21.860 --> 12:25.680
Now the boomers who are aching for a taste of when games were once good, get some nostalgia

12:25.680 --> 12:27.500
in the form of the return of cheat codes.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.340
And now these pretend accessibility advocates get to put something in their shitty Kotaku

12:31.340 --> 12:32.720
article that nobody will read.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.860
But it seems like Tim Schafer would rather shit his pants at people who actually want

12:35.900 --> 12:37.420
to play the game he's created.

12:37.420 --> 12:40.660
Also, excuse me, but um, shooty mcblam?

12:40.660 --> 12:44.340
Using a mick like that as a slur against the Irish I'll have you know, progs need to

12:44.340 --> 12:48.420
stop abusing the term accessibility to mean consuming the raw content of a video game

12:48.420 --> 12:51.220
easily and without any sort of roadblock whatsoever.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.220
But they won't.

12:52.220 --> 12:55.260
Because that would mean giving up the ethical grounding upon which their own subjective

12:55.260 --> 12:57.700
tastes and consumption patterns rest upon.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.820
Without that, they'd have to admit that it really is just a matter of personal preference,

13:00.820 --> 13:03.540
and that the onus really is on them to get good.

13:03.540 --> 13:07.480
But that means personal responsibility, and turning your own individual inadequacies into

13:07.480 --> 13:11.540
a social issue is a great way of blaming everybody else for your own bullshit.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.580
I'm not even against the people who use the invincibility mode or whatever, I just

13:14.580 --> 13:15.580
won't use it.

13:15.580 --> 13:16.580
That's fine.

13:16.580 --> 13:19.540
But one, banter is still legitimate, and just like in the old days, if you play on

13:19.540 --> 13:22.120
easy, yeah, laughing at you is fine.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.120
Laughing at me is fine too.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.620
Yes you're a big kid, that's the point.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.900
And two, we all know where this eventually leads, don't we?

13:29.900 --> 13:34.060
Superhot went from having a really cool game with some admittedly dark components, mainly

13:34.060 --> 13:38.600
suicide and brain alteration, to having a toggle to remove those dark components despite

13:38.600 --> 13:42.500
them being essential to the story, to just outright removing them for everybody in the

13:42.500 --> 13:43.780
name of accessibility.

13:43.780 --> 13:47.580
It won't stop with the inclusion of easy modes, but the exclusion of hard modes.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.420
Mass Effect Legendary Edition was already significantly easier on its hardest difficulties

13:51.420 --> 13:52.500
than the original game.

13:52.500 --> 13:56.260
The Grand Theft Auto trilogy re-release also seems to be similarly rebalanced.

13:56.260 --> 13:59.700
This is only going to continue unless you start voting with your wallets.

13:59.700 --> 14:03.180
Probably the most disgusting part of it all, though, is how these people co-op those with

14:03.180 --> 14:08.300
actual real physical needs because they're tired of being made fun for being DSP clones.

14:08.300 --> 14:11.820
This is like if a guy in a wheelchair said, I need a ramp to enter the building, and then

14:11.820 --> 14:15.540
the city government spent six figures on a public education campaign, put up billboards

14:15.540 --> 14:20.060
and signs everywhere, ran TV and radio ads promoting the plight of the disabled, donated

14:20.060 --> 14:24.540
huge sums to the advocacy group People United for Ramps in America, collected research on

14:24.540 --> 14:28.940
the opinion of violent anti-ramp groups, and then when the guy in the wheelchair once again

14:28.940 --> 14:33.340
just asked to have a ramp built, he would be arrested for harassing and threatening

14:33.340 --> 14:55.140
city officials as part of the alt-right gamergate fascist group We Won't Wheel.
