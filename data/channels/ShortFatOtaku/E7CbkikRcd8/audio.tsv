0	16040	People just love to talk about accessibility in video games.
16040	17040	And I get it.
17040	20920	Wouldn't it suck to be blind, or some kind of clawed half-man creature, and not be able
20920	21920	to hold a controller?
21920	25800	You wouldn't be able to experience the mountain of quality video games that exist out there.
25800	29360	Specialized controllers for people who don't have normal hands seems to be a fine idea
29360	30360	to me.
30360	34520	Though, in actuality, they end up just being fight sticks, or sometimes altered controllers
34520	36600	that put all the button presses under one hand.
36600	37600	But hey, it works!
37600	41800	There's also a vest that deaf people can wear that translates in-game sound effects
41800	42800	into vibrations, too.
42800	43800	That's really cool!
43800	46600	And a lot of games are including colorblind options.
46600	52260	For example, the green, blue, purple, orange-tier coloring for common, rare, epic, and legendary
52260	55840	items has been in use since, I think, Diablo.
55840	61300	And I recall games even as old as Borderlands 2 having colorblind options to make that sort
61300	63720	of thing stand out a little bit better for people who are colorblind.
63720	68320	But the practical reality is, some games just can't be adapted to work with every single
68320	69320	disability.
69320	73400	Sometimes, somebody with partial blindness, but who can still see bright things, will
73400	77040	still be able to play a game if it's set up in a mode where contrast is turned up or
77040	78080	something like that.
78080	81760	But a horror game that relies on squinting into the darkness, or subtle movements in
81760	86900	the distance, there's just no way to bridge that gap without ruining the feel of things.
86900	91640	It sounds funny to say it, but we often forget just how debilitating disabilities are.
91640	95280	We should try to accommodate people, but we should also understand that our ability to
95280	96720	accommodate has its limits.
96720	100520	And if there are some gaps that are just too big to bridge, it's nobody's fault.
100520	102800	Not the disabled persons, not the game developers.
102800	103800	That's just life.
103800	104800	There you go.
104800	108880	I've just given you the whole of the accessibility in games position that is actually reasonable,
108880	111000	and not mired in progressive bullshit.
111000	113160	Getting past this point is going to be nonsense.
113160	114160	Strap yourselves in.
114160	117140	I wouldn't want you to get whiplash and have to play your games in a neck brace.
117140	121680	In 2010, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act was passed in the
121680	122680	United States.
122680	127760	As reported on DualShockers.com, it's a piece of general purpose legislation that requires
127760	132040	accessibility concerns addressed in all advanced communication services.
132040	136640	The gaming industry is affected only insofar as voice chat, text chat, and video chat in
136640	137920	online games are concerned.
137920	142080	And due to technology not being there in 2010, the gaming industry was given several
142080	145760	extensions up to January 1st, 2019 to implement changes.
145760	150000	Now if you were hyper-tuned into the culture war back then, like for example our old spurgy
150000	153840	pal Billy from One Angry Gamer, you might believe that Big Brother Government was going
153840	158120	to dumb down all of our games such that the hardest mode possible would only be fit for
158120	160280	a doped-up Dean Takahashi.
160280	163680	But that's what you get for only reading the headlines and not actually checking out
163680	165040	the legislation involved.
165040	167640	I guess this is why you sold OAG, eh Billy?
167680	172200	However, despite this being a joke position, progressives have actually taken the position
172200	173200	up.
173200	176520	A lot of progs like to repurpose the accessibility angle in order to push for stuff that actually
176520	178000	has nothing to do with helping the disabled.
178000	181900	And everything to do with dumbing things down, rounding the corners, making everything brightly
181900	185840	colored and identifiable, and catering to everybody's most specific tastes, no matter
185840	187720	how ridiculous and demanding they are.
187720	190120	The dear girl from the last video over on Twitch?
190120	195520	Yeah, she thinks that voice chat is inherently a non-inclusive game mechanic, not only because
195520	199800	some people are mute, but because some trans people don't have passing voices.
199800	204200	Also, the person giving out the deer-gasms in that cringe video clip I played for you,
204200	208680	that I played twice, believes in this position so strongly that she's willing to insult
208680	210980	people's dyslexia over it.
210980	213840	Being ableist in your advocacy for disabilities.
213840	214840	Good job.
214840	218340	Sorry, had to do it.
218340	222700	But most famously of all, the progs are using accessibility as an excuse to backdoor in
222700	225480	a general lowering of difficulty in games.
225480	229000	Because I guess not being able to get fucking good as a disability now?
229000	233000	When Sekiro came out back in 2019, game journos who couldn't beat the game, or hell, get
233000	237160	beyond the first hour, started dropping articles talking about accessibility, when what they
237160	239120	were actually talking about was difficulty.
239120	243420	Yes, even in the article whose headline blatantly says it's not about difficulty, it's actually
243420	244920	about difficulty too if you were to read it.
244920	249160	We saw viral tweets and articles like this, if the entire point of your video game rests
249160	253720	on the player's ability to perform fast-click challenges and precision jumping in bullshit
253720	258240	mechanic gimmicks, then you aren't telling a good story, you're making bop it for grownups.
258240	262960	Anyone who ever uses the word gameplay needs to seriously consider their life choices.
262960	266780	Now that Ubisoft's opened the door, can we have our skip boss fight button?
266780	270880	Why Dark Souls 3 should have an easy mode, and the problem with playing to win?
270880	274040	Twitch streamers are sick of being shamed for playing a game on easy.
274040	278800	Oh shut the fuck up, I'm shamed all the time on my stream, that's part of the fun.
278800	282520	As streamers, we're dancing monkeys, and if that means that sometimes you're the butt
282520	285760	of the joke, that's how it is, you hypersensitive art hoe.
312520	318360	Also, watch Game Boomers already you cucks.
318360	322400	That last article is Patricia Hernandez's most recent abortion published on Polygon,
322400	324400	and it's in reference to this video.
324400	329080	Hi friends, I want you to look right in my eyes right now, you know exactly who I'm talking
329080	330080	to.
330080	335320	Hi, shut the fuck up, let people play games however they want to, are you seriously roasting
335320	341380	me for trying to play a story that is notoriously one of the most convoluted lore-based games
341380	345060	in existence to try to figure out the lore and listen to the dialogue and watch the cutscenes
345060	346380	and enjoy it?
346380	353020	I swear to god, I swear to god, not everybody wants to play games to be absolutely infuriated
353020	358660	and in pain the entire time.
358660	364620	I will absolutely suplex you the fuck out of my chat, stop gatekeeping how people play
364620	367620	games, it's so fucking boring, you're boring!
367620	371340	I wonder what kind of worldview you have to have to think that you're boring is a proper
371340	372940	reply to getting blown the fuck out.
372940	376820	I know at least two breadtubers who say that on the regular, and it's like damn dude, the
376820	378740	rest of the world doesn't exist for your entertainment.
378740	381860	In fact, if you're on stream it's the way around, you're the boring one for bitching
381860	385020	that your chat is having a good time laughing at you, and if you don't want to be laughed
385020	386220	at, get good.
386220	390460	This tiktok also went viral a couple months ago, and it's cut from the same cloth.
416220	418880	Side note, we are not hating on people that make video games a priority.
418880	421980	If being good at video games is one of your priorities, what an excellent way to spend
421980	423980	your downtime, I am flabbergasted by your skills.
423980	427500	It's just not one of my priorities, I have many skills in this life, but beating Hollow
427500	429420	Knight mini-bosses is not one of them.
429420	433660	I don't want a challenge, life is hard enough, I want a cool interactive story.
433660	437260	What happens is I get frustrated on a fight I can't beat, and I end up giving up and
437260	440220	I lose out on so much cool stories.
440220	443060	Video game creators, this is my plea to you.
443060	446380	Slash slash, on with the story.
446380	449140	Easy modes, please, thank you.
449140	453440	Holy shit, did we need this one to be an angry feminist rages in the car flavor?
453440	457660	The problem with the position presented in these two videos is that it completely backfires
457660	460660	when you put it together with another prog talking point.
460660	462940	Not everything has to be for everybody.
462940	463940	Which is true.
463940	467860	For example, High Guardian Spice is not for me, it's for the chromosomally deficient
467860	471780	who think that Steven Universe or BoJack Horseman were actually good shows, but that's fine,
471780	475820	not everything's for me, not everything is to my taste, but it doesn't have to be.
475820	479780	And it also doesn't have to be for the adult infants who can't beat Hollow Knight either.
479780	484060	I have many skills in this life, but beating Hollow Knight mini-bosses is not one of them.
484060	486200	Guess what, lady, Hollow Knight's not for you.
486200	488980	And that's okay, there are other games you can play.
488980	493780	Progs always hide their it's not meant for you card when something is not to their taste.
493780	496300	Because the truth is, they want everything to be meant for them.
496300	500920	Their thought process is, hey, here's something popular, like Hollow Knight, like Sekiro,
500920	501920	like Dark Souls 3.
501920	503760	It's in the current cultural zeitgeist.
503760	507080	I want to be able to tweet about it while it's still relevant, but it's actually not
507080	508080	my thing.
508080	512840	Therefore, I'm excluded, and exclusion is a social justice problem, and so the solution
512840	515160	is to change it to be something that I like.
515160	520520	It's a related medical condition to the Netflix adaptation tumor, called the Easy Mode Lesions.
520520	524520	In fact, if you only want to watch a game, then go watch a stream or a let's play or
524520	526600	a fucking movie adaptation, I don't know.
526600	528480	Hell, Shenmue is getting an anime.
528480	531080	That game will probably even be better as an anime, just go watch that.
531080	535040	Of course, if this is the way that customers want it, or rather, if game developers think
535040	539200	that this is the way that customers want it based on an annoyingly loud minority online,
539200	543280	they're going to start implementing shit that Sony revealed as part of its PS5 accessibility
543280	544280	microtransactions.
544280	547800	Imagine approaching a boss during a game, and you suddenly get this popup.
547800	551800	Players who used Resource E were successful on their first attempt 80% of the time and
551800	554940	defeated Boss X in about 1 minute on average.
554940	559280	Expect Resource E now, with Resource E costing a buck or two on the PlayStation Store.
559280	562220	I remember people ridiculing this shit back in the 2000s.
562220	566660	In fact, I booted up Mass Effect 3 on my old Xbox 360 because I'm playing through it
566660	569660	on stream right now, and still available on Xbox Live.
569660	574980	On the 360, even now, for this decade old game, are $5.99 gun packs to unlock super
574980	577640	strong weapons not available during normal play.
577640	581500	We made fun of this shit back in the day, and rightly so, and now it's going to be
581500	583380	pop-ups right in the game.
583380	586540	Speaking of microtransactions, what the fresh hell is this?
586540	588540	Alright, alright, let's see.
588540	592860	Subtitles are of course useful for deaf and hard of hearing players, while colorblindness
592860	596300	modes have been an increasingly common feature in games.
596300	597300	There.
597300	601260	I've played the only good part of this 20 minute Jim Sterling video for you.
601260	603340	That was the only good point made.
603340	606840	Everything else is listening to that cat bell jingle while the two of them try to deliver
606840	607840	their lines.
607840	610880	Why are you wearing a collar?
610880	614440	Something else in this video is just complaints about how microtransactions are evil, and
614440	618280	they certainly can be, but how they're also ableist, because people with certain disabilities
618280	622000	just can't control themselves, and have to spend spend spend on loot boxes and other
622000	623000	shit.
623000	625480	And sure, for some people, that's probably true, but for a lot of others, I think it's
625480	629600	just people externalizing their lack of discipline, blaming some other variable so they don't
629600	632240	have to own up to the possibility that they need to work on themselves.
632240	637840	In a moment that shames me, I once idly spent money on pocket fucking mortys without really
637840	640100	thinking about what I was doing.
640100	644460	My impulsiveness and my lack of patience for the grinding and randomization made me toss
644460	649680	some money to get more of the dribblingly and unsatisfyingly unlockable playable mortys,
649680	655580	and I didn't even think about how I was buying loot boxes until immediately afterwards, where
655580	660660	my brain actually caught up and said, wait a minute, my lack of self control as a result
660660	664460	of simply not thinking is genuinely scary to me.
664460	666660	This is like saying it's McDonald's fault that you got fat.
666660	668340	No, just stop fucking eating it, dude.
668340	672180	Truth be told, the accessibility discourse in gaming is the most disingenuous bullshit
672180	673180	I've ever heard.
673180	676380	If progs actually cared about the disabled, the conversation wouldn't revolve around
676380	679940	easy modes, but would instead focus on things like the lack of colorblind settings in most
679940	683260	games, or the pain of getting specialized controllers or interfaces to work on some
683260	686060	platforms, most notably PS4 and PS5 right now.
686060	689760	Yet, whenever they bring up the accessibility issue, it's never actually about disabled
689760	694300	people because they do not give a shit about disabilities, and in fact, are very happy
694300	697580	to be ableist if it serves their interests, as I've covered in another video.
697580	701100	They only talk about difficulty, and they use the disabled as a shield for their own
701100	702100	lack of skill.
702100	706780	It was a recent story that Double Fine put an invincibility toggle in Psychonauts 2.
706780	710740	Not an optional invincibility powerup like in the more recent Mario games, but a straight
710740	712920	up, turn it on in the menu, you're now invincible.
712920	717640	And Tim Schafer decided to characterize his critics like this, uh, excuse me, I beat sword
717640	721540	guy serious time on a no hit hard mode, and if you didn't do that, I don't respect
721540	722540	you.
722540	725620	And like, can you even comment on things if you're not Diamond 6 rank in shooty mcblam?
725620	726620	I don't think so.
726660	728140	Cool bud, you're so cool.
728140	732100	Now, if Tim Schafer wasn't a walking turn up, but actually knew how to appeal to his
732100	736460	primary fanbase, which at this point is only people who have fond memories of Psychonauts
736460	737940	1, here is what he should have done.
737940	740860	He should have put in an invincibility mode as a cheat code.
740860	741860	There you go.
741860	745680	Now the boomers who are aching for a taste of when games were once good, get some nostalgia
745680	747500	in the form of the return of cheat codes.
747500	751340	And now these pretend accessibility advocates get to put something in their shitty Kotaku
751340	752720	article that nobody will read.
752720	755860	But it seems like Tim Schafer would rather shit his pants at people who actually want
755900	757420	to play the game he's created.
757420	760660	Also, excuse me, but um, shooty mcblam?
760660	764340	Using a mick like that as a slur against the Irish I'll have you know, progs need to
764340	768420	stop abusing the term accessibility to mean consuming the raw content of a video game
768420	771220	easily and without any sort of roadblock whatsoever.
771220	772220	But they won't.
772220	775260	Because that would mean giving up the ethical grounding upon which their own subjective
775260	777700	tastes and consumption patterns rest upon.
777700	780820	Without that, they'd have to admit that it really is just a matter of personal preference,
780820	783540	and that the onus really is on them to get good.
783540	787480	But that means personal responsibility, and turning your own individual inadequacies into
787480	791540	a social issue is a great way of blaming everybody else for your own bullshit.
791540	794580	I'm not even against the people who use the invincibility mode or whatever, I just
794580	795580	won't use it.
795580	796580	That's fine.
796580	799540	But one, banter is still legitimate, and just like in the old days, if you play on
799540	802120	easy, yeah, laughing at you is fine.
802120	805120	Laughing at me is fine too.
805120	807620	Yes you're a big kid, that's the point.
807620	809900	And two, we all know where this eventually leads, don't we?
809900	814060	Superhot went from having a really cool game with some admittedly dark components, mainly
814060	818600	suicide and brain alteration, to having a toggle to remove those dark components despite
818600	822500	them being essential to the story, to just outright removing them for everybody in the
822500	823780	name of accessibility.
823780	827580	It won't stop with the inclusion of easy modes, but the exclusion of hard modes.
827580	831420	Mass Effect Legendary Edition was already significantly easier on its hardest difficulties
831420	832500	than the original game.
832500	836260	The Grand Theft Auto trilogy re-release also seems to be similarly rebalanced.
836260	839700	This is only going to continue unless you start voting with your wallets.
839700	843180	Probably the most disgusting part of it all, though, is how these people co-op those with
843180	848300	actual real physical needs because they're tired of being made fun for being DSP clones.
848300	851820	This is like if a guy in a wheelchair said, I need a ramp to enter the building, and then
851820	855540	the city government spent six figures on a public education campaign, put up billboards
855540	860060	and signs everywhere, ran TV and radio ads promoting the plight of the disabled, donated
860060	864540	huge sums to the advocacy group People United for Ramps in America, collected research on
864540	868940	the opinion of violent anti-ramp groups, and then when the guy in the wheelchair once again
868940	873340	just asked to have a ramp built, he would be arrested for harassing and threatening
873340	895140	city officials as part of the alt-right gamergate fascist group We Won't Wheel.
