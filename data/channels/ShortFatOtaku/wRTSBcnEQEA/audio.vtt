00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
Good morning my friends! As you can tell by the title, it's my birthday today!

00:03.520 --> 00:07.040
I've already received a bunch of birthday wishes on the SFO discord,

00:07.040 --> 00:09.680
and I appreciate them all. You guys are pretty awesome.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.520
I've got one request, buddies.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.160
E3 is happening right now, same day as my birthday,

00:14.160 --> 00:17.040
and I'm going to be streaming all of the conferences live.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.360
Please consider checking my E3 streams out.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.360
I'm going to be going live at twitch.tv slash game boomers,

00:23.360 --> 00:27.600
and probably also my dlive channels, dlive.tv slash game boomers,

00:27.600 --> 00:32.160
and dlive.tv slash short taotaku throughout the course of E3.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.560
Still can't stream to youtube until July unfortunately,

00:34.560 --> 00:36.000
otherwise I'd be doing it here too.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.080
Here's my stream schedule for the event.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.360
June 8th, that's today.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.640
The Electronic Arts Conference starts at noon EST,

00:42.640 --> 00:46.880
and later tonight at 7pm EST, I'm going to stream some birthday festivities.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.160
Sunday, June 9th.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.480
The Microsoft Conference is at 4pm EST.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.600
The Bethesda Conference is at 830pm EST,

00:53.600 --> 00:56.800
and the Devolver Digital Conference at 10pm EST.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.720
During that gap between Microsoft's Conference and Bethesda's Conference,

01:00.720 --> 01:03.360
I'll probably stream some video games, chat with you guys,

01:03.360 --> 01:05.440
maybe even take requests on what to play.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.720
Monday, June 10th.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.200
The PC Conference is at 1pm EST,

01:09.200 --> 01:11.760
the Ubisoft Conference is at 4pm EST,

01:11.760 --> 01:14.720
and the Square Enix Conference is at 9pm EST.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.920
Like on Sunday, I'll stream some video games between the gaps and shows.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.360
Tuesday, June 11th at noon is the Nintendo E3 Direct, and the end of E3.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.760
After E3, I'm probably going to take a break from my gaming streams

01:25.760 --> 01:29.200
until my Thursday morning Sonic show, because that's a lot of streams to do.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.400
But on Wednesday, Arch, Sargon, V, and I

01:32.400 --> 01:35.280
should be starting a campaign of Vampire the Masquerade.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.200
That's still a secret though, don't tell anybody.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.120
Thank you for all of your support, guys.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.960
Even if you can't make it to the E3 streams,

01:40.960 --> 01:44.000
or you have no interest in my gaming or non-political content,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.560
I still appreciate your clicks, views, and donations.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.840
You're the reason I can squeak by doing all this stuff full time.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.480
And hopefully I'll see you in my chatroom in about an hour.

01:53.040 --> 01:53.760
I love you.
