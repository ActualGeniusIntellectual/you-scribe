0	3520	Good morning my friends! As you can tell by the title, it's my birthday today!
3520	7040	I've already received a bunch of birthday wishes on the SFO discord,
7040	9680	and I appreciate them all. You guys are pretty awesome.
9680	11520	I've got one request, buddies.
11520	14160	E3 is happening right now, same day as my birthday,
14160	17040	and I'm going to be streaming all of the conferences live.
17040	19360	Please consider checking my E3 streams out.
19360	23360	I'm going to be going live at twitch.tv slash game boomers,
23360	27600	and probably also my dlive channels, dlive.tv slash game boomers,
27600	32160	and dlive.tv slash short taotaku throughout the course of E3.
32160	34560	Still can't stream to youtube until July unfortunately,
34560	36000	otherwise I'd be doing it here too.
36000	38080	Here's my stream schedule for the event.
38080	39360	June 8th, that's today.
39360	42640	The Electronic Arts Conference starts at noon EST,
42640	46880	and later tonight at 7pm EST, I'm going to stream some birthday festivities.
46880	48160	Sunday, June 9th.
48160	50480	The Microsoft Conference is at 4pm EST.
50480	53600	The Bethesda Conference is at 830pm EST,
53600	56800	and the Devolver Digital Conference at 10pm EST.
56800	60720	During that gap between Microsoft's Conference and Bethesda's Conference,
60720	63360	I'll probably stream some video games, chat with you guys,
63360	65440	maybe even take requests on what to play.
65440	66720	Monday, June 10th.
66720	69200	The PC Conference is at 1pm EST,
69200	71760	the Ubisoft Conference is at 4pm EST,
71760	74720	and the Square Enix Conference is at 9pm EST.
74720	77920	Like on Sunday, I'll stream some video games between the gaps and shows.
77920	83360	Tuesday, June 11th at noon is the Nintendo E3 Direct, and the end of E3.
83360	85760	After E3, I'm probably going to take a break from my gaming streams
85760	89200	until my Thursday morning Sonic show, because that's a lot of streams to do.
89200	92400	But on Wednesday, Arch, Sargon, V, and I
92400	95280	should be starting a campaign of Vampire the Masquerade.
95280	97200	That's still a secret though, don't tell anybody.
97200	99120	Thank you for all of your support, guys.
99120	100960	Even if you can't make it to the E3 streams,
100960	104000	or you have no interest in my gaming or non-political content,
104000	106560	I still appreciate your clicks, views, and donations.
106560	109840	You're the reason I can squeak by doing all this stuff full time.
109840	112480	And hopefully I'll see you in my chatroom in about an hour.
113040	113760	I love you.
