00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Good morning my friends! As you can tell by the title, it's my birthday today!

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,040
I've already received a bunch of birthday wishes on the SFO discord,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,680
and I appreciate them all. You guys are pretty awesome.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,520
I've got one request, buddies.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,160
E3 is happening right now, same day as my birthday,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,040
and I'm going to be streaming all of the conferences live.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,360
Please consider checking my E3 streams out.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,360
I'm going to be going live at twitch.tv slash game boomers,

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,600
and probably also my dlive channels, dlive.tv slash game boomers,

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,160
and dlive.tv slash short taotaku throughout the course of E3.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,560
Still can't stream to youtube until July unfortunately,

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,000
otherwise I'd be doing it here too.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,080
Here's my stream schedule for the event.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,360
June 8th, that's today.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
The Electronic Arts Conference starts at noon EST,

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,880
and later tonight at 7pm EST, I'm going to stream some birthday festivities.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,160
Sunday, June 9th.

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
The Microsoft Conference is at 4pm EST.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,600
The Bethesda Conference is at 830pm EST,

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
and the Devolver Digital Conference at 10pm EST.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,720
During that gap between Microsoft's Conference and Bethesda's Conference,

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,360
I'll probably stream some video games, chat with you guys,

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,440
maybe even take requests on what to play.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,720
Monday, June 10th.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,200
The PC Conference is at 1pm EST,

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,760
the Ubisoft Conference is at 4pm EST,

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,720
and the Square Enix Conference is at 9pm EST.

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
Like on Sunday, I'll stream some video games between the gaps and shows.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,360
Tuesday, June 11th at noon is the Nintendo E3 Direct, and the end of E3.

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,760
After E3, I'm probably going to take a break from my gaming streams

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,200
until my Thursday morning Sonic show, because that's a lot of streams to do.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
But on Wednesday, Arch, Sargon, V, and I

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
should be starting a campaign of Vampire the Masquerade.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
That's still a secret though, don't tell anybody.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,120
Thank you for all of your support, guys.

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Even if you can't make it to the E3 streams,

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
or you have no interest in my gaming or non-political content,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
I still appreciate your clicks, views, and donations.

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
You're the reason I can squeak by doing all this stuff full time.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,480
And hopefully I'll see you in my chatroom in about an hour.

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,760
I love you.
