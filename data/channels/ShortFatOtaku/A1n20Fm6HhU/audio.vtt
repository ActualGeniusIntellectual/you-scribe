00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
Recently, conservatives on social media were up in arms for some inexplicable reason over

00:05.120 --> 00:09.560
a resurfaced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez high school dancing video.

00:09.560 --> 00:14.760
This is about as dumb as going after Trump over Kofefe or Obama for smoking weed in college.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.340
I understand why conservatives want to do it, don't get me wrong, people are getting

00:18.340 --> 00:23.040
fired left and right right now for the shitty tweets or takes or YouTube videos or whatever

00:23.040 --> 00:27.160
from 10 plus years ago, even if they happened back during their school days.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.840
So I can really understand why the right would want to take a page from the left's

00:30.840 --> 00:34.400
own handbook and try to destroy the newest socialist poster child.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.400
But this is just dumb.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.600
There's a lot of ways to discredit Cortez that don't revolve around somehow trying

00:38.600 --> 00:40.880
to make a scandal out of innocent teenage fun.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.400
That's just a nothingburger.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.200
For example, you could talk about the absolute amount of bullshit frothing from her mouth

00:46.200 --> 01:09.160
when she revealed that she was somehow Jewish.

01:09.160 --> 01:19.400
And the story, you know, the story goes during the Spanish Inquisition, as so many people

01:19.400 --> 01:25.560
were forced to convert on the exterior to Catholicism, but on the interior continued

01:25.560 --> 01:30.320
to practice their faith, continued to be who they were, even though they were pressured

01:30.320 --> 01:37.160
to not be that on the outside world and a strong group of people, strong will that were

01:37.160 --> 01:42.560
determined to continue living life as they wanted to live it, decided to get on a boat

01:42.560 --> 01:44.440
and leave Spain.

01:44.440 --> 01:48.760
And some of those people handed in Puerto Rico and some of those people decided to flee

01:48.760 --> 01:49.760
up into the mountains.

01:49.760 --> 01:55.240
And as is the story of Puerto Rico, we are a people that are in amalgamation.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.240
We are no one thing.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.240
We are black.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.240
We are indigenous.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.240
We are Spanish.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.240
We are European.

02:00.240 --> 02:08.640
And to think about that, to think about how the culture in Puerto Rico was that people

02:08.640 --> 02:12.000
would open up closets and there would be a small menorah inside.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.760
Yeah, this is the most blatant attempt at trying to grab at a community for votes that

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
I've ever seen.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.680
And notice how she says that she's black, she's native, she's Spanish, she's Jewish.

02:20.680 --> 02:24.480
The implication is, I want all the votes from all of these minority groups.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.720
I'm one of you guys, though I have to say, that's a pretty amazing picture of the Washington

02:29.720 --> 02:31.560
Post chose for the story.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.840
Or you could talk about her comparison of the migrant caravan to Jews fleeing the Holocaust.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.320
Yeah, I'm not sure about that one, comrade.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.580
The migrants at America's southern border aren't fleeing genocide.

02:41.580 --> 02:45.360
They're funded by radical left advocacy groups hoping to slip by the border police before

02:45.360 --> 02:46.520
the wall goes up.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.560
Or you could talk about her insane Green New Deal.

02:49.560 --> 02:54.640
You're talking about zero carbon emissions, no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.840
That is the goal.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.840
It's ambitious.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.160
How is that possible?

02:58.160 --> 03:01.240
You're talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?

03:01.240 --> 03:08.040
It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right

03:08.040 --> 03:09.200
now.

03:09.200 --> 03:17.400
What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
possible?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.100
This would require raising taxes.

03:20.100 --> 03:23.800
There's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
in taxes.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.440
Do you have a specific on the tax rate?

03:26.880 --> 03:32.960
You look at our tax rates back in the 60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system,

03:32.960 --> 03:41.900
your tax rate, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be 10% or 15%, et cetera.

03:41.900 --> 03:48.600
But once you get to the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax

03:48.600 --> 03:51.300
rates as high as 60 or 70%.

03:51.300 --> 03:56.040
That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that

03:56.040 --> 04:01.720
as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.800
What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda compared to the way politics

04:06.800 --> 04:08.840
is done right now.

04:08.840 --> 04:15.000
Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.960
Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation.

04:19.960 --> 04:25.360
Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs

04:25.360 --> 04:26.840
like Social Security.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.240
That is radical.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.240
Do you call yourself a radical?

04:29.240 --> 04:32.320
Yeah, you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.760
I would say that socialists don't understand that if you overtax the upper class to the

04:36.760 --> 04:41.320
point that it's no longer profitable to run large enterprises or build businesses or create

04:41.320 --> 04:45.120
jobs, if you overtax the upper class to the point that it's actually more profitable on

04:45.120 --> 04:49.440
paper to be middle class, considering the relative time and energy investment, that

04:49.440 --> 04:53.680
all of the rich people in society simply pull out their money and businesses and go to other

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
countries.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
I do think, on some level, socialists do actually understand this, which is why the existence

05:00.000 --> 05:03.400
of a capitalist society on the other side of the planet is oppressive to them.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.520
It's why socialism has to be worldwide.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.160
The producing class must not have a place to escape to when the government decides to

05:09.160 --> 05:11.280
come down on them for being too successful.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.080
And that's what Cortez sounds like here.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.120
Either she's simply a utopian ideologue who doesn't actually understand basic economics,

05:17.120 --> 05:20.480
or she's on the same path as every other communist dictator in human history.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.000
And the answer is probably both.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.360
Or to continue this train of thought, you could talk about her membership with the Democratic

05:25.360 --> 05:26.700
Socialists of America.

05:26.700 --> 05:30.800
This is a group that, like most socialist organizations, believes in the abolition of

05:30.800 --> 05:34.840
capitalism in favor of an economy run either by the workers or the state, though the exact

05:34.840 --> 05:38.800
specifics of abolishing capitalism are fiercely debated by socialists.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.160
I've talked about why this is a huge red fucking flag, no pun intended, on this channel

05:43.160 --> 05:45.680
multiple times, so we don't need to go too deep into it.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.240
But while capitalism is certainly not perfect, it is the best economic system humanity has

05:50.240 --> 05:51.720
ever produced by far.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.720
When one, only money matters, not your race or your class or your gender, but only how

05:56.720 --> 06:01.340
much money you have in your pocket, and two, money is a rough estimate of how much value

06:01.340 --> 06:05.380
your work has brought to the lives of other people you interact with, and it is because

06:05.380 --> 06:09.280
they were willing to pay you for it, when one and two are both true, capitalism is equally

06:09.280 --> 06:13.440
a method of exchange and a measurement of morality at the same time.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.800
Socialists just don't get this.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.000
They assume that structural inequality puts some people at the bottom rung in capitalism.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.480
In some cases that's true, but it's also the continuing life choices of the people

06:22.480 --> 06:24.120
that find themselves there.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.760
Socialists do not like to consider the personal responsibility argument, because socialists

06:27.760 --> 06:30.440
don't want to grant individuals personal responsibility.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.440
It's all about government force, mountaintop edicts, and the rights of the collective taking

06:34.440 --> 06:36.340
precedence over the rights of the individual.

06:36.340 --> 06:40.620
And Cortez is exactly that type of quasi-religious zealot socialist.

06:40.620 --> 06:44.680
She and many others like her act like they've been given divine wisdom from beyond the veil

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
or something.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.580
It doesn't matter if it's anything close to reality, what matters is that they believe

06:48.580 --> 06:49.580
in it.

06:49.580 --> 06:50.800
It's about feelings to her, not facts.

06:50.800 --> 06:55.300
A pragmatic argument about politics or economics will never interest somebody like Cortez,

06:55.300 --> 06:58.680
because she will always fall back in ideology whenever one of her positions is refuted by

06:58.680 --> 07:01.060
something pesky like reason or proof.

07:01.060 --> 07:05.200
That's why Cortez reframed Ben Shapiro's invitation to debate as catcalling.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.940
It's the emotional response to a pragmatic question.

07:07.940 --> 07:12.020
Cortez actually sees a challenge to her ideology as if it were an assault on her person, because

07:12.020 --> 07:14.800
all her person consists of is her ideology.

07:14.800 --> 07:19.500
There are many good ways, and many good reasons, to attack Cortez's political positions.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.380
The philosophy she's guided by brought about the greatest catastrophe of human history,

07:23.380 --> 07:27.700
and she's too young, too dumb, and too ideological to understand that she's following in the

07:27.700 --> 07:29.580
exact same footsteps.

07:29.580 --> 07:33.100
Conservatives don't need to resort to something as petty as old high school videos.

07:33.100 --> 07:36.880
Of course, if you're just in it to troll, you could also ask why a dyed red commie is

07:36.880 --> 07:40.500
teaming up with the capitalistic robber baron of big tech known as Twitter.

07:40.500 --> 07:44.880
Cortez's Twitter handle used to be OKZO2018, now it's just AOC.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.680
I thought maybe she bought an old account and switched over, and a premium Twitter like

07:48.680 --> 07:50.080
that must not have been cheap.

07:50.080 --> 07:54.700
But as it turns out, the original AOC was an Islamic spam bot before getting banned,

07:54.700 --> 07:57.640
and Twitter just decided to take the name out of the banned retirement pool and give

07:57.640 --> 07:58.640
it to her.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.080
I know it's only a Twitter handle, but it's still a tiny symptom of a massive problem.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.600
Socialists will talk all day about the working class and the proletariat revolution and all

08:06.600 --> 08:11.020
this other nonsense, but when the chips are down, socialists in power will always cut

08:11.020 --> 08:15.540
deals with the most exploitative capitalists, and become robber barons themselves.

08:15.540 --> 08:18.780
This is how Maduro got so fat while Venezuela continues to starve.

08:18.780 --> 08:21.700
This is how Stalin and Mao killed millions of their own people.

08:21.700 --> 08:25.140
And Cortez will never say it, hell, she'll never admit it to herself, but if she ever

08:25.140 --> 08:29.420
got her hands on real power, the path from legitimate good intentions to the gulag is

08:29.420 --> 08:30.500
very short indeed.
