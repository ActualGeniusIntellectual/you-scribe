00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Recently, conservatives on social media were up in arms for some inexplicable reason over

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,560
a resurfaced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez high school dancing video.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,760
This is about as dumb as going after Trump over Kofefe or Obama for smoking weed in college.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,340
I understand why conservatives want to do it, don't get me wrong, people are getting

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,040
fired left and right right now for the shitty tweets or takes or YouTube videos or whatever

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,160
from 10 plus years ago, even if they happened back during their school days.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,840
So I can really understand why the right would want to take a page from the left's

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,400
own handbook and try to destroy the newest socialist poster child.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
But this is just dumb.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,600
There's a lot of ways to discredit Cortez that don't revolve around somehow trying

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,880
to make a scandal out of innocent teenage fun.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,400
That's just a nothingburger.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,200
For example, you could talk about the absolute amount of bullshit frothing from her mouth

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:01:09,160
when she revealed that she was somehow Jewish.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:19,400
And the story, you know, the story goes during the Spanish Inquisition, as so many people

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,560
were forced to convert on the exterior to Catholicism, but on the interior continued

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,320
to practice their faith, continued to be who they were, even though they were pressured

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,160
to not be that on the outside world and a strong group of people, strong will that were

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,560
determined to continue living life as they wanted to live it, decided to get on a boat

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,440
and leave Spain.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,760
And some of those people handed in Puerto Rico and some of those people decided to flee

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
up into the mountains.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,240
And as is the story of Puerto Rico, we are a people that are in amalgamation.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
We are no one thing.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
We are black.

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
We are indigenous.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
We are Spanish.

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
We are European.

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,640
And to think about that, to think about how the culture in Puerto Rico was that people

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,000
would open up closets and there would be a small menorah inside.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
Yeah, this is the most blatant attempt at trying to grab at a community for votes that

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
I've ever seen.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,680
And notice how she says that she's black, she's native, she's Spanish, she's Jewish.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,480
The implication is, I want all the votes from all of these minority groups.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm one of you guys, though I have to say, that's a pretty amazing picture of the Washington

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,560
Post chose for the story.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,840
Or you could talk about her comparison of the migrant caravan to Jews fleeing the Holocaust.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,320
Yeah, I'm not sure about that one, comrade.

39
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,580
The migrants at America's southern border aren't fleeing genocide.

40
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,360
They're funded by radical left advocacy groups hoping to slip by the border police before

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
the wall goes up.

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,560
Or you could talk about her insane Green New Deal.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,640
You're talking about zero carbon emissions, no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,840
That is the goal.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
It's ambitious.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
How is that possible?

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,240
You're talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:08,040
It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,200
now.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:17,400
What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
possible?

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,100
This would require raising taxes.

53
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,800
There's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
in taxes.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Do you have a specific on the tax rate?

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,960
You look at our tax rates back in the 60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system,

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:41,900
your tax rate, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be 10% or 15%, et cetera.

58
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,600
But once you get to the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,300
rates as high as 60 or 70%.

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,040
That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that

61
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,720
as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,800
What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda compared to the way politics

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,840
is done right now.

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,960
Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,360
Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,840
like Social Security.

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,240
That is radical.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Do you call yourself a radical?

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,320
Yeah, you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,760
I would say that socialists don't understand that if you overtax the upper class to the

72
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,320
point that it's no longer profitable to run large enterprises or build businesses or create

73
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,120
jobs, if you overtax the upper class to the point that it's actually more profitable on

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,440
paper to be middle class, considering the relative time and energy investment, that

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,680
all of the rich people in society simply pull out their money and businesses and go to other

76
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
countries.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I do think, on some level, socialists do actually understand this, which is why the existence

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,400
of a capitalist society on the other side of the planet is oppressive to them.

79
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,520
It's why socialism has to be worldwide.

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,160
The producing class must not have a place to escape to when the government decides to

81
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,280
come down on them for being too successful.

82
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,080
And that's what Cortez sounds like here.

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,120
Either she's simply a utopian ideologue who doesn't actually understand basic economics,

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,480
or she's on the same path as every other communist dictator in human history.

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,000
And the answer is probably both.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,360
Or to continue this train of thought, you could talk about her membership with the Democratic

87
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,700
Socialists of America.

88
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,800
This is a group that, like most socialist organizations, believes in the abolition of

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,840
capitalism in favor of an economy run either by the workers or the state, though the exact

90
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,800
specifics of abolishing capitalism are fiercely debated by socialists.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,160
I've talked about why this is a huge red fucking flag, no pun intended, on this channel

92
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,680
multiple times, so we don't need to go too deep into it.

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
But while capitalism is certainly not perfect, it is the best economic system humanity has

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,720
ever produced by far.

95
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,720
When one, only money matters, not your race or your class or your gender, but only how

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,340
much money you have in your pocket, and two, money is a rough estimate of how much value

97
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,380
your work has brought to the lives of other people you interact with, and it is because

98
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,280
they were willing to pay you for it, when one and two are both true, capitalism is equally

99
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,440
a method of exchange and a measurement of morality at the same time.

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,800
Socialists just don't get this.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,000
They assume that structural inequality puts some people at the bottom rung in capitalism.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,480
In some cases that's true, but it's also the continuing life choices of the people

103
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,120
that find themselves there.

104
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,760
Socialists do not like to consider the personal responsibility argument, because socialists

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,440
don't want to grant individuals personal responsibility.

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,440
It's all about government force, mountaintop edicts, and the rights of the collective taking

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,340
precedence over the rights of the individual.

108
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,620
And Cortez is exactly that type of quasi-religious zealot socialist.

109
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,680
She and many others like her act like they've been given divine wisdom from beyond the veil

110
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
or something.

111
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,580
It doesn't matter if it's anything close to reality, what matters is that they believe

112
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
in it.

113
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,800
It's about feelings to her, not facts.

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,300
A pragmatic argument about politics or economics will never interest somebody like Cortez,

115
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,680
because she will always fall back in ideology whenever one of her positions is refuted by

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,060
something pesky like reason or proof.

117
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,200
That's why Cortez reframed Ben Shapiro's invitation to debate as catcalling.

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,940
It's the emotional response to a pragmatic question.

119
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,020
Cortez actually sees a challenge to her ideology as if it were an assault on her person, because

120
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,800
all her person consists of is her ideology.

121
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,500
There are many good ways, and many good reasons, to attack Cortez's political positions.

122
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,380
The philosophy she's guided by brought about the greatest catastrophe of human history,

123
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,700
and she's too young, too dumb, and too ideological to understand that she's following in the

124
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,580
exact same footsteps.

125
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,100
Conservatives don't need to resort to something as petty as old high school videos.

126
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,880
Of course, if you're just in it to troll, you could also ask why a dyed red commie is

127
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,500
teaming up with the capitalistic robber baron of big tech known as Twitter.

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,880
Cortez's Twitter handle used to be OKZO2018, now it's just AOC.

129
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,680
I thought maybe she bought an old account and switched over, and a premium Twitter like

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
that must not have been cheap.

131
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,700
But as it turns out, the original AOC was an Islamic spam bot before getting banned,

132
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,640
and Twitter just decided to take the name out of the banned retirement pool and give

133
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
it to her.

134
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,080
I know it's only a Twitter handle, but it's still a tiny symptom of a massive problem.

135
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,600
Socialists will talk all day about the working class and the proletariat revolution and all

136
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,020
this other nonsense, but when the chips are down, socialists in power will always cut

137
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,540
deals with the most exploitative capitalists, and become robber barons themselves.

138
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,780
This is how Maduro got so fat while Venezuela continues to starve.

139
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,700
This is how Stalin and Mao killed millions of their own people.

140
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,140
And Cortez will never say it, hell, she'll never admit it to herself, but if she ever

141
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,420
got her hands on real power, the path from legitimate good intentions to the gulag is

142
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,500
very short indeed.
