0	5120	Recently, conservatives on social media were up in arms for some inexplicable reason over
5120	9560	a resurfaced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez high school dancing video.
9560	14760	This is about as dumb as going after Trump over Kofefe or Obama for smoking weed in college.
14760	18340	I understand why conservatives want to do it, don't get me wrong, people are getting
18340	23040	fired left and right right now for the shitty tweets or takes or YouTube videos or whatever
23040	27160	from 10 plus years ago, even if they happened back during their school days.
27160	30840	So I can really understand why the right would want to take a page from the left's
30840	34400	own handbook and try to destroy the newest socialist poster child.
34400	35400	But this is just dumb.
35400	38600	There's a lot of ways to discredit Cortez that don't revolve around somehow trying
38600	40880	to make a scandal out of innocent teenage fun.
40880	42400	That's just a nothingburger.
42400	46200	For example, you could talk about the absolute amount of bullshit frothing from her mouth
46200	69160	when she revealed that she was somehow Jewish.
69160	79400	And the story, you know, the story goes during the Spanish Inquisition, as so many people
79400	85560	were forced to convert on the exterior to Catholicism, but on the interior continued
85560	90320	to practice their faith, continued to be who they were, even though they were pressured
90320	97160	to not be that on the outside world and a strong group of people, strong will that were
97160	102560	determined to continue living life as they wanted to live it, decided to get on a boat
102560	104440	and leave Spain.
104440	108760	And some of those people handed in Puerto Rico and some of those people decided to flee
108760	109760	up into the mountains.
109760	115240	And as is the story of Puerto Rico, we are a people that are in amalgamation.
115240	116240	We are no one thing.
116240	117240	We are black.
117240	118240	We are indigenous.
118240	119240	We are Spanish.
119240	120240	We are European.
120240	128640	And to think about that, to think about how the culture in Puerto Rico was that people
128640	132000	would open up closets and there would be a small menorah inside.
132000	135760	Yeah, this is the most blatant attempt at trying to grab at a community for votes that
135760	136760	I've ever seen.
136760	140680	And notice how she says that she's black, she's native, she's Spanish, she's Jewish.
140680	144480	The implication is, I want all the votes from all of these minority groups.
144480	149720	I'm one of you guys, though I have to say, that's a pretty amazing picture of the Washington
149720	151560	Post chose for the story.
151560	155840	Or you could talk about her comparison of the migrant caravan to Jews fleeing the Holocaust.
155840	158320	Yeah, I'm not sure about that one, comrade.
158320	161580	The migrants at America's southern border aren't fleeing genocide.
161580	165360	They're funded by radical left advocacy groups hoping to slip by the border police before
165360	166520	the wall goes up.
166520	169560	Or you could talk about her insane Green New Deal.
169560	174640	You're talking about zero carbon emissions, no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.
174640	175840	That is the goal.
175840	176840	It's ambitious.
177160	178160	How is that possible?
178160	181240	You're talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?
181240	188040	It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right
188040	189200	now.
189200	197400	What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent
197400	198400	possible?
198400	200100	This would require raising taxes.
200100	203800	There's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share
203800	204800	in taxes.
204800	206440	Do you have a specific on the tax rate?
206880	212960	You look at our tax rates back in the 60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system,
212960	221900	your tax rate, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be 10% or 15%, et cetera.
221900	228600	But once you get to the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax
228600	231300	rates as high as 60 or 70%.
231300	236040	That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that
236040	241720	as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.
241720	246800	What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda compared to the way politics
246800	248840	is done right now.
248840	255000	Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country.
255000	259960	Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation.
259960	265360	Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs
265360	266840	like Social Security.
266840	268240	That is radical.
268240	269240	Do you call yourself a radical?
269240	272320	Yeah, you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.
272320	276760	I would say that socialists don't understand that if you overtax the upper class to the
276760	281320	point that it's no longer profitable to run large enterprises or build businesses or create
281320	285120	jobs, if you overtax the upper class to the point that it's actually more profitable on
285120	289440	paper to be middle class, considering the relative time and energy investment, that
289440	293680	all of the rich people in society simply pull out their money and businesses and go to other
293680	294680	countries.
295000	300000	I do think, on some level, socialists do actually understand this, which is why the existence
300000	303400	of a capitalist society on the other side of the planet is oppressive to them.
303400	305520	It's why socialism has to be worldwide.
305520	309160	The producing class must not have a place to escape to when the government decides to
309160	311280	come down on them for being too successful.
311280	313080	And that's what Cortez sounds like here.
313080	317120	Either she's simply a utopian ideologue who doesn't actually understand basic economics,
317120	320480	or she's on the same path as every other communist dictator in human history.
320480	322000	And the answer is probably both.
322000	325360	Or to continue this train of thought, you could talk about her membership with the Democratic
325360	326700	Socialists of America.
326700	330800	This is a group that, like most socialist organizations, believes in the abolition of
330800	334840	capitalism in favor of an economy run either by the workers or the state, though the exact
334840	338800	specifics of abolishing capitalism are fiercely debated by socialists.
338800	343160	I've talked about why this is a huge red fucking flag, no pun intended, on this channel
343160	345680	multiple times, so we don't need to go too deep into it.
345680	350240	But while capitalism is certainly not perfect, it is the best economic system humanity has
350240	351720	ever produced by far.
351720	356720	When one, only money matters, not your race or your class or your gender, but only how
356720	361340	much money you have in your pocket, and two, money is a rough estimate of how much value
361340	365380	your work has brought to the lives of other people you interact with, and it is because
365380	369280	they were willing to pay you for it, when one and two are both true, capitalism is equally
369280	373440	a method of exchange and a measurement of morality at the same time.
373440	374800	Socialists just don't get this.
374800	379000	They assume that structural inequality puts some people at the bottom rung in capitalism.
379000	382480	In some cases that's true, but it's also the continuing life choices of the people
382480	384120	that find themselves there.
384120	387760	Socialists do not like to consider the personal responsibility argument, because socialists
387760	390440	don't want to grant individuals personal responsibility.
390440	394440	It's all about government force, mountaintop edicts, and the rights of the collective taking
394440	396340	precedence over the rights of the individual.
396340	400620	And Cortez is exactly that type of quasi-religious zealot socialist.
400620	404680	She and many others like her act like they've been given divine wisdom from beyond the veil
404680	405680	or something.
405680	408580	It doesn't matter if it's anything close to reality, what matters is that they believe
408580	409580	in it.
409580	410800	It's about feelings to her, not facts.
410800	415300	A pragmatic argument about politics or economics will never interest somebody like Cortez,
415300	418680	because she will always fall back in ideology whenever one of her positions is refuted by
418680	421060	something pesky like reason or proof.
421060	425200	That's why Cortez reframed Ben Shapiro's invitation to debate as catcalling.
425200	427940	It's the emotional response to a pragmatic question.
427940	432020	Cortez actually sees a challenge to her ideology as if it were an assault on her person, because
432020	434800	all her person consists of is her ideology.
434800	439500	There are many good ways, and many good reasons, to attack Cortez's political positions.
439500	443380	The philosophy she's guided by brought about the greatest catastrophe of human history,
443380	447700	and she's too young, too dumb, and too ideological to understand that she's following in the
447700	449580	exact same footsteps.
449580	453100	Conservatives don't need to resort to something as petty as old high school videos.
453100	456880	Of course, if you're just in it to troll, you could also ask why a dyed red commie is
456880	460500	teaming up with the capitalistic robber baron of big tech known as Twitter.
460500	464880	Cortez's Twitter handle used to be OKZO2018, now it's just AOC.
464880	468680	I thought maybe she bought an old account and switched over, and a premium Twitter like
468680	470080	that must not have been cheap.
470080	474700	But as it turns out, the original AOC was an Islamic spam bot before getting banned,
474700	477640	and Twitter just decided to take the name out of the banned retirement pool and give
477640	478640	it to her.
478640	483080	I know it's only a Twitter handle, but it's still a tiny symptom of a massive problem.
483080	486600	Socialists will talk all day about the working class and the proletariat revolution and all
486600	491020	this other nonsense, but when the chips are down, socialists in power will always cut
491020	495540	deals with the most exploitative capitalists, and become robber barons themselves.
495540	498780	This is how Maduro got so fat while Venezuela continues to starve.
498780	501700	This is how Stalin and Mao killed millions of their own people.
501700	505140	And Cortez will never say it, hell, she'll never admit it to herself, but if she ever
505140	509420	got her hands on real power, the path from legitimate good intentions to the gulag is
509420	510500	very short indeed.
