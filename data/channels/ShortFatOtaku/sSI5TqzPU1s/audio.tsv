18480	21680	Hi everyone, I'm the pro.
21680	23680	Here we fucking go!
23680	25680	Rest on no talent, k.
25680	29680	This is like kind of an odd, very odd episode.
29680	31680	Is it? Is it odd?
31680	34680	It's a mixture of- I know why it's odd! We're on a new couch!
34680	35680	Oh yeah!
35680	37680	Look at this beautiful fucking thing.
37680	39680	It's Navajo print.
39680	43680	Cabbage said, I feel really comfortable in this for some strange reason.
43680	47680	And Megan thought it was cool.
47680	51680	It's pretty comfortable. It's better than that one that sucks so much.
51680	52680	Yeah.
52680	53680	I mean, you'll see-
53680	56680	Definitely tip it down the stairs and it broke.
56680	58680	We were getting an idea.
58680	60680	It broke even more.
60680	65680	You'll see the other couch for a while because of backlogs of episodes and stuff.
65680	66680	This is recent.
66680	68680	This is the new. This is the new couch.
68680	71680	Anyways, the couch is awesome.
71680	73680	The couch is great.
73680	75680	That's all I have to say about the couch.
76680	82680	What couch manufacturer makes these cushions come off?
82680	85680	These should be stuck on the back of the couch.
85680	90680	Okay, I'm gonna go Rick James. I'm gonna say fuck your couch.
90680	94680	People clicked on this link because it said Zoe Quinn.
94680	96680	So we should probably talk about Zoe Quinn.
96680	99680	She's the one that made this game.
99680	102680	It's more of a depression simulator.
102680	104680	It's an educational tool.
104680	106680	You know what this game is?
106680	111680	It's when you get one of those shitty pick your own adventure novels where you just choose through.
111680	113680	Yeah, it is like a choose your own adventure.
113680	115680	All it is is reading.
115680	117680	It's not a game. This is not a video game.
117680	120680	People talk about visual novels being video games.
120680	123680	Visual novels. Phoenix Wright.
124680	126680	What else was there?
128680	130680	That's the only one that comes to mind for me.
131680	133680	Cacho Sojo.
134680	135680	Yeah.
135680	138680	The one about all the crippled girls. He ended up banging.
138680	140680	Oh yeah.
140680	142680	He's like a burn victim. The girl who's mute.
142680	143680	Oh yeah.
143680	144680	Let's begin the game.
144680	146680	Let's play Depression Quest.
146680	149680	Well, I kind of wanted to give a little bit of a...
151680	153680	Shut the fuck up.
154680	160680	This is like the week after Robin Williams killed himself.
160680	167680	Why is Robin... Don't sully Robin Williams' name by dragging him through Zoe Quinn's vagina.
169680	170680	Too bad.
171680	173680	Let's resume the game. Click on resume the game already.
174680	175680	I'm...
177680	182680	This emotional character is probably mostly describable except as a sort of double bind which any
182680	184680	clash all the alternatives associated with...
184680	186680	This is an ugly font.
186680	192680	Sitting or standing, doing or resting, speaking or keeping silent, living or dying are not just unpleasant but literally horrible.
192680	200680	You know, when she brought this game on Steam I thought she'd actually make it look like a game and not just like the HTML click through links that it was.
200680	201680	Yeah.
201680	203680	Nope. Looks the exact same.
204680	207680	Depression Quest is a game that deals with living and depression and very little...
207680	209680	You don't need to read everything.
209680	211680	View controls. How to play the game.
211680	214680	Yeah. Scroll page, select next... Oh.
215680	217680	You can also have a mouse. Use the mouse.
217680	218680	Yeah.
218680	220680	Fucking example of one.
220680	222680	Example of one.
222680	224680	I can use a controller. Can we use a controller?
225680	226680	Why would you want...
226680	228680	I don't.
228680	230680	Yes, just begin.
230680	232680	Embark on your journey!
234680	236680	Here's the thing about the person that made this game...
238680	240680	Let me get into what I'm doing, okay?
242680	244680	I learned this game because Camera Lady showed it to me.
244680	250680	And what went down with Camera Lady was Zoe Quinn, the maker of this game, was doing a live stream.
251680	254680	And Camera Lady shows up and she's kind of like watching it and seeing what's going on.
254680	260680	And they talk about Depression Quest and some guy plays Depression Quest and they have this very serious conversation about Depression Quest.
261680	275680	And Camera Lady's like, well listen, I have autism and this does not really describe my experience with depression because people with autism and depression both have completely different symptoms.
276680	277680	Well, yeah.
277680	285680	Because she mentioned people with autism don't become lethargic when they have depression like regular people do.
285680	287680	They just become very disorganized.
287680	290680	Because people with autism are always constantly fucking going.
291680	296680	She's like, no, I have focus now. I didn't have focus before.
296680	303680	So my experience with depression is kind of different from this and she wanted to have a conversation about it.
303680	305680	And then Zoe Quinn just blocked her.
305680	308680	Because she's like, no, do not disagree with my vision.
310680	312680	So, welcome to Zoe Quinn everybody.
312680	318680	Yeah. Okay, so Dev just made sure to sit me down before this.
318680	319680	Yes.
319680	324680	And Camera Lady, she said in the past, you know, there's something that happened before.
325680	329680	Well, Camera Lady showed me what went down with Zoe and then I showed Dev.
329680	330680	That was kind of the chain of events.
330680	331680	That's always the chain of events.
331680	335680	She mentioned the stuff that happened before. It's just the stuff that happened yesterday.
335680	339680	Mid-20s, I have a girlfriend or boyfriend.
339680	343680	No, it's girlfriend. But also you can be a male or female, but the girl is definitely a girl.
343680	344680	Okay, girl is a girl.
344680	345680	Yeah, girls are girls.
345680	346680	Girls are girls.
346680	347680	Oh yeah, that's true.
347680	348680	That's true.
348680	351680	I kissed a girl and I liked it.
352680	353680	And I got a job.
353680	354680	Yeah.
354680	355680	I got a job.
355680	359680	Okay, I remember when I first played this, I tried to get her to kill herself and she didn't.
361680	367680	Like, I picked every terrible wrong answer and she's like, no, I'm not going to kill myself. I'm just going to be a bum.
367680	368680	I was like, oh, okay.
369680	370680	Well, uh-huh.
370680	371680	You're a bum rack.
372680	374680	So, this woman that made this game.
375680	376680	Oh, this is a music.
379680	381680	You want a symmetrical Docker breast, Dave?
385680	386680	No.
387680	390680	I'm going to sip my beer.
391680	393680	You sip my Pabst Blue Ribbon.
394680	396680	I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
397680	402680	Okay, so Zoe Quinn, Kimberly can provide all the interesting pictures and links to things.
403680	406680	Yeah, she tried to get this on the Green Light Project.
406680	408680	But she did because we're playing it on Steam right now.
408680	409680	Yeah, she did.
410680	411680	And it didn't take.
412680	413680	It only took. It's right here.
413680	415680	Ah, no, here's the thing.
416680	418680	She, it initially didn't take.
419680	422680	Then someone from this troll, this troll wiki.
423680	424680	Yeah, Wizard Champ.
425680	427680	They trolled, well, they trolled Wizard Champ.
428680	433680	It's like basically a bunch of male versions and there's solidarity there, you know, by all means.
435680	437680	A couple of anonymous posters said...
438680	439680	Fuck Zoe Quinn.
440680	442680	I think they said she's a cunt.
443680	446680	And this is something like a place where she never would have gone otherwise.
447680	460680	This troll links her to this forum and then she saw it as a reason to become a victim and utilize that to get Green Light percentages.
461680	464680	A couple of people didn't like Zoe Quinn.
464680	471680	Zoe Quinn then pretended that it was a giant raid on her by the entire 4chan-based internet.
472680	477680	And used that exposure to get like a bunch of people floating and like white knighting for her and...
478680	481680	Oh, by the way, she also has like a bingo on her site where she's like...
482680	484680	One of the panels in the bingo is white knight.
484680	487680	If someone says that someone white knighted for you, check that off your bingo.
488680	492680	Well, Zoe Quinn, if you're watching, you can check it off your bingo because you know what?
492680	495680	Even if that's part of your bingo, people did white knight for you.
496680	501680	You caused a bunch of assholes to show up and watch shitty Netflix.
502680	505680	No, you caused a bunch of assholes to show up and jump to your defense because they were stupid.
506680	508680	And you were just smart enough to make them do it.
509680	511680	Oh, manipulate them enough.
512680	516680	So, she gets Green Light and now she has some e-fame and she has like...
516680	526680	I'm an actual indie games developer and I'm doing stuff and I cut myself open and put fucking microchips underneath my skin because I'm hardcore like that.
527680	530680	And she basically just attention cores another spot in her bingo.
531680	537680	But it's true. It's funny how all the spots in the bingo are actually true criticisms of her as a human being.
538680	540680	Oh, it gets better.
541680	546680	Here's the thing. If a male did this, I'd be just as critical.
547680	552680	Zoe Darham, it's not that you have a vagina. It's that you're a terrible human.
553680	555680	That's where the criticism is coming from.
556680	557680	Yeah, yeah.
558680	560680	Because I would do this to a man. I would call him a terrible piece of shit as well.
561680	563680	Oh, instantly.
564680	566680	I'm gonna call him a bitch.
567680	568680	You're gonna call him Mumsy? Oh no, you're calling him...
568680	569680	My girl.
570680	571680	Yeah, the girlfriend.
572680	574680	You know what this is? That's the medication I'm taking.
575680	576680	Really?
577680	578680	It's exactly the same kind in exactly the same dose.
579680	580680	Oh.
581680	584680	So do you think Zoe Quinn broke into your house and took a picture of your meds to vote in the game?
585680	586680	Yes.
587680	589680	Well, you know, here's the thing. It gets worse.
590680	591680	Yesterday...
592680	593680	Yes, yesterday.
594680	595680	Her ex-boyfriend.
595680	600680	She's filming this. It might be two or three days by the time it comes out, because I know Cameron Lee's gonna rush this one out.
601680	604680	Yesterday, her ex-boyfriend shows up on the internets.
605680	607680	With a mountain of evidence.
608680	612680	A mountain of evidence against her, basically showing how she lies, manipulates, cheats on him.
613680	617680	The TLDR. The two of them didn't read. The two of them didn't read.
618680	621680	He calls her burgers and fries. Like five guys burgers and fries.
622680	623680	Because she had sex with five guys.
623680	627680	Two of them when they were broken up, briefly, and three of them while they were still dating.
628680	629680	One of whom was married.
630680	635680	If you're broken up and you're on a break, and you have sex with somebody else, and you get back together with them,
636680	640680	I mean, you didn't cheat on them, because you're on a break. You are free. You're single at that point.
641680	642680	You should tell them when you get back together.
643680	646680	And then, of course, have it, cheating on him with three fucking people.
649680	650680	That's terrible.
650680	654680	Your buddy on lines? I just found out I got cheated on.
656680	657680	Oh no, that's horrible.
658680	659680	Was Attic dating Zoe Quinn?
664680	665680	Here's the thing, too.
666680	672680	One of the biggest problems that this guy had with her was that she'd always go on this moral high ground.
673680	676680	Especially when they first met and said, oh, cheating of any kind is reprehensible.
676680	688680	It's reprehensible, it's anti-feminist, it's kind of related to rape, because it involves a withdrawal of consent and still doing something behind their back anyway.
689680	693680	It's always not the same as rape, but it involves fucking with consent, so it's kind of in the same category.
694680	699680	She says all this shit, and yet she's a pathological liar, and then she just bangs a bunch of dudes.
699680	706680	The worst part about all of this is that basically everything Zoe Quinn has right now, she got through underhanded means.
707680	723680	In any sort of e-fame, any sort of e-fame, any sort of credibility as this woman feminist queer icon within gaming, all of it, it's all based on her exposing a philosophy that she cannot live herself.
724680	726680	Oh, we finished the game already. What happened? Did we die?
727680	728680	No.
729680	730680	Did we defeat the aliens?
731680	738680	Yes. Okay, so I just did this, I did that, and I did okay. Basically the kind of way that I feel like I'm doing right now.
739680	755680	But as a social worker, it seems like Zoe Quinn is very much the product of a poisonous environment, because the way that her ex talked about her, she had a really shitty upbringing.
756680	758680	That still doesn't excuse doing shitty things, though.
759680	765680	Oh, it doesn't excuse it? It gives context to it. It gives reasoning behind it.
766680	768680	Hey Dave, you should unlock the secret medication.
771680	775680	Do it! Do it! I'm going to try doing the shittiest choices now.
776680	777680	Yeah, just call it the lower ones.
778680	786680	Yeah, like this guy too, he even had a video of him showing his computer and her old Facebook account.
787680	804680	Yeah, showing that it's all real. Also, here's the worst part about it. A regular person, when they get caught in a lie, and they fuck up, if it's a serious lie, they'll break down, they'll cry, they'll beg forgiveness, they'll be sincerely sorry.
805680	808680	And they'll at the very least try to make things better.
809680	817680	Sorry, I just noticed something. The worse your options are, the grayer it gets and the more it looks like there's static. Because that's what it kind of feels like.
818680	825680	And they usually try to make up for it, make it better, do their best. They'll be like, I fucked up.
826680	838680	Someone like Zoe Quinn, when caught in her lies, she becomes very, very remorseful for the things she's been caught in. She doesn't fess up to anything.
839680	846680	She doesn't seriously feel any kind of remorse. She's just doing damage control on herself.
846680	855680	And immediately making new lies to cover the old ones, or try to repair the old ones. There's snowballs on her.
856680	869680	And at the very end of everything, after she's lied about cheating, she's lied about her life philosophy, she's lied about everything she's gained in the gaming community, once that's all been revealed to her now ex as a lie,
870680	881680	her only interactions with him from that point on are to try and ensure he doesn't basically reveal everything. Which he did.
882680	890680	He did. I say good for him. Can we do this in real life so that there's no evidence of what I'm going to say to you? Shit like that, you know?
890680	900680	Yeah, cause I mean, he's not that much of a, I mean, he has amassed a grand amount of evidence, but he doesn't seem like the type of guy, he sounds like a pretty stand up guy.
901680	906680	He's pointing all this stuff out there, but I mean, the guy's been, he's just been jerked around for months.
907680	908680	Oh, you, uh...
909680	912680	Oh, I doubt if that'll kill. I'm going to try to go for middle ground now.
913680	914680	You're in middle ground.
915680	923680	There across the table, your mother, weekly, meeting her gaze, we're dropping her ass to the floor, you open your mouth to answer but no words come out, you don't even bother pretending to try and think of what to say.
924680	929680	This is like the worst ending where your mom says, are you okay? And you just collapse.
930680	931680	Yeah.
932680	933680	She doesn't start crying, she just kind of goes...
934680	939680	But no, see, here's the problem. Why doesn't this game have an ending where you kill yourself?
940680	946680	Because that is the ending, that is the worst ending of Depression Quest. Game over.
947680	948680	Yeah.
949680	950680	So she kind of fucked up.
952680	959680	Well, yeah, this is minor. This is the most minor part of her fucking up.
960680	961680	Yeah, that's true.
962680	963680	Lady, you have...
964680	965680	Go for the best ending this time, dude.
966680	967680	I am.
967680	968680	Yeah, because you're in the middle ground.
969680	972680	They don't allow this, they don't allow you to be going through the best stuff.
973680	977680	No, but you can still work your way to the best possible ending just by being smart about it, right?
978680	980680	Here's the thing, like drinking earnest, maybe?
981680	982680	No.
983680	984680	I don't know, avoid the crowd?
985680	987680	Yeah, avoid the crowd. I avoided the crowd when I got my best ending.
990680	992680	She's like, thanks for coming, sweetheart.
992680	997680	Anyway, oh, by the way, the writing is not really that good in this game.
998680	1001680	It's okay, it's passable, it gets the point across.
1002680	1003680	It's utilitarian.
1004680	1005680	Yeah, it does what it needs to do.
1006680	1007680	Yeah, get the cat.
1008680	1009680	Oh, yeah.
1010680	1011680	How do you like camera lady's dog?
1012680	1014680	It's always easy to be happy to see me whenever I go downstairs.
1017680	1021680	Does it hump your leg? Does it blow its load inside of your...
1022680	1023680	Inside of my leg?
1024680	1025680	No, inside of your...
1026680	1027680	Inside of my butthole?
1028680	1029680	Your butthole, really.
1030680	1031680	No, I actually don't know if it's male or female.
1032680	1034680	Yeah, you have to notice that your hands are shaking so she'll help you at this point.
1035680	1036680	Yeah.
1037680	1038680	And then you go to therapy and things are okay.
1039680	1040680	And then teeth grinding.
1041680	1042680	Yeah, just be honest about everything.
1043680	1044680	This lying is bad.
1045680	1046680	Lying is bad.
1047680	1048680	You should probably learn the lesson here at your own game.
1049680	1050680	What the fuck, man?
1050680	1057680	If you play this game and it's not bad, the intent is actually very honorable, then why?
1058680	1059680	You know what I think?
1060680	1062680	Is that the other people, she programmed it and the other people just wrote it.
1063680	1064680	Programmed it?
1065680	1067680	You mean made an HTML page and clicked through links?
1068680	1069680	Yeah.
1070680	1071680	Something I could do when I was 12 years old?
1072680	1073680	I got the best ending.
1074680	1075680	No.
1076680	1077680	Did you lose?
1078680	1079680	No, you didn't. No, it's not.
1080680	1081680	I'm good, man.
1082680	1085680	Really? Because I remember doing one where I actually was able to move in with Alex.
1086680	1087680	Didn't you?
1088680	1089680	Well, I don't think so.
1090680	1091680	Let's see, let's see.
1092680	1093680	Doing the job?
1094680	1095680	The biggest change in your life has been your relationship with Alex.
1096680	1097680	You're terrified about it?
1098680	1099680	Yeah.
1100680	1101680	Yeah, you're thinking about it but you're not actually doing it.
1102680	1103680	Oh, you did? You didn't get the best ending?
1104680	1105680	Oh, no.
1106680	1108680	You got to print in the Contra code for this motherfucker.
1108680	1109680	God damn it.
1110680	1111680	Okay.
1112680	1113680	The game sucks.
1114680	1117680	To finish up our Depression Quest episode, Zoe doesn't follow her own philosophy, obviously.
1118680	1119680	No, she's very, very, very hypocritical.
1120680	1129680	Regarding feminism, regarding consent, regarding love, regarding relationships, regarding being an interesting game developer, regarding any kind of decent morality.
1129680	1141680	A lot of the stuff she has is basically based on a lie because she straight up fucked her way up through the ranks rather than actually...
1142680	1143680	Or lied. Play the victim.
1144680	1147680	Yeah, play the victim. Basically anything other than get their own merit.
1148680	1152680	I think it's a sad state when a person has to use evidence from their own relationship.
1153680	1157680	But it's a high profile thing now because she's made herself well known through...
1157680	1168680	One of the most overwhelming opinions on Twitter is, I never liked Zoe. I couldn't pinpoint why. Now I know.
1169680	1176680	There was something a bit too fake about how she acted in her YouTube videos and her livestream. There was something too fake about it but I couldn't figure it out.
1177680	1182680	Now I have the full picture. Now I understand what kind of person Zoe Quinn actually is.
1182680	1196680	And yeah, it's truly a shame because there are real female queer icons out there who should be front and center in their fight to get recognized in the gaming industry.
1197680	1203680	And here she is, doing this bullshit. Dave, you gotta unlock the golden mouse cursor.
1203680	1220680	Here's a great example. Machinima, the YouTube network. They will not speak in written form or on Skype if the Skype call is being recorded for their contracts for YouTube channels.
1221680	1228680	Zoe Quinn is acting like machinima in their business dealings. They're shady, underhanded, everyone hates machinima business dealings.
1229680	1237680	And Zoe Quinn is doing the same thing. And she turns around and is like, no, I don't want there to be any more evidence of what I'm doing. Please don't release this because it would ruin my life.
1238680	1242680	I don't care that I actually trampled over you, but this would hurt me so let me try to convince you.
1242680	1251680	She is, I guess to finish it off, she's like a truly heartless human being. She is sociopathic, at least in her actions.
1252680	1269680	It definitely comes across as sociopathic. At the very least it comes across as someone that has sociopathic tendencies because of being raised in a poisonous environment.
1269680	1280680	I'll end it with this. I'll end our episode with this. The only reason we even deal with this, because usually we don't talk about too much internet drama on this show. We just kind of just play games and watch anime and have fun.
1281680	1296680	The main reason we do this today is because Zoe treated camera lady like such shit. Camera lady comes to me yesterday or whatever and is like, you gotta see this. We gotta put out a video. And I was like, okay, let's fucking do it.
1297680	1305680	You know what I think is the worst kind of hell? Having to do this game over and over again. That's my Sisyphean hellishness.
1306680	1310680	You know what I think the worst kind of hell would probably be? Having to deal with Zoe Quinn.
1311680	1320680	You know what the worst part is? The absolute worst part is? On the off chance should Zoe actually watch this video? You know what she'll say?
1320680	1327680	What's that? These are just some white guys. So obviously what they're saying has no very own reality. Even though I've been honest?
1328680	1344680	That's how social justice words kind of just discredit their opponents. They just pick out by what barometer they may be part of a majority in society. Like a privileged majority and just say, oh you're that. Obviously nothing you say is valid.
1344680	1364680	Dude, there was a controversy like a couple weeks ago where JonTron said the word retired. And people said he looks white. Even though he's not white, he looks white. Therefore any objection he has to our criticism is rendered invalid.
1365680	1368680	Even though he's not white, he's Persian.
1369680	1375680	Let's get this shit out of here. Goodbye. Fuck you Depression Quest. You're a bad video game.
1376680	1377680	Alright, alright.
1378680	1385680	Stop, stop. I can't, I can't. I'm too depressed. I'm in a glass cage. Oh no. Shut up.
1394680	1395680	Ah.
1416680	1417680	Ah.
1424680	1425680	Ah.
1454680	1455680	Ah.
1481680	1482680	Ah.
1484680	1485680	Ah.
1504680	1505680	Ah.
1514680	1516680	Ah.
