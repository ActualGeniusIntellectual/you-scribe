00:13.320 --> 00:18.480
ðŸŽµ Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo ðŸŽµ

00:18.480 --> 00:21.680
Hi everyone, I'm the pro.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.680
Here we fucking go!

00:23.680 --> 00:25.680
Rest on no talent, k.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.680
This is like kind of an odd, very odd episode.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.680
Is it? Is it odd?

00:31.680 --> 00:34.680
It's a mixture of- I know why it's odd! We're on a new couch!

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
Oh yeah!

00:35.680 --> 00:37.680
Look at this beautiful fucking thing.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.680
It's Navajo print.

00:39.680 --> 00:43.680
Cabbage said, I feel really comfortable in this for some strange reason.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.680
And Megan thought it was cool.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.680
It's pretty comfortable. It's better than that one that sucks so much.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
Yeah.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
I mean, you'll see-

00:53.680 --> 00:56.680
Definitely tip it down the stairs and it broke.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.680
We were getting an idea.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.680
It broke even more.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.680
You'll see the other couch for a while because of backlogs of episodes and stuff.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
This is recent.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.680
This is the new. This is the new couch.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.680
Anyways, the couch is awesome.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.680
The couch is great.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.680
That's all I have to say about the couch.

01:16.680 --> 01:22.680
What couch manufacturer makes these cushions come off?

01:22.680 --> 01:25.680
These should be stuck on the back of the couch.

01:25.680 --> 01:30.680
Okay, I'm gonna go Rick James. I'm gonna say fuck your couch.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.680
People clicked on this link because it said Zoe Quinn.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.680
So we should probably talk about Zoe Quinn.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.680
She's the one that made this game.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.680
It's more of a depression simulator.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.680
It's an educational tool.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.680
You know what this game is?

01:46.680 --> 01:51.680
It's when you get one of those shitty pick your own adventure novels where you just choose through.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.680
Yeah, it is like a choose your own adventure.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.680
All it is is reading.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.680
It's not a game. This is not a video game.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.680
People talk about visual novels being video games.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.680
Visual novels. Phoenix Wright.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.680
What else was there?

02:08.680 --> 02:10.680
That's the only one that comes to mind for me.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.680
Cacho Sojo.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
Yeah.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.680
The one about all the crippled girls. He ended up banging.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.680
Oh yeah.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.680
He's like a burn victim. The girl who's mute.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.680
Oh yeah.

02:23.680 --> 02:24.680
Let's begin the game.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.680
Let's play Depression Quest.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.680
Well, I kind of wanted to give a little bit of a...

02:31.680 --> 02:33.680
Shut the fuck up.

02:34.680 --> 02:40.680
This is like the week after Robin Williams killed himself.

02:40.680 --> 02:47.680
Why is Robin... Don't sully Robin Williams' name by dragging him through Zoe Quinn's vagina.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
Too bad.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.680
Let's resume the game. Click on resume the game already.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.680
I'm...

02:57.680 --> 03:02.680
This emotional character is probably mostly describable except as a sort of double bind which any

03:02.680 --> 03:04.680
clash all the alternatives associated with...

03:04.680 --> 03:06.680
This is an ugly font.

03:06.680 --> 03:12.680
Sitting or standing, doing or resting, speaking or keeping silent, living or dying are not just unpleasant but literally horrible.

03:12.680 --> 03:20.680
You know, when she brought this game on Steam I thought she'd actually make it look like a game and not just like the HTML click through links that it was.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.680
Yeah.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.680
Nope. Looks the exact same.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.680
Depression Quest is a game that deals with living and depression and very little...

03:27.680 --> 03:29.680
You don't need to read everything.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.680
View controls. How to play the game.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.680
Yeah. Scroll page, select next... Oh.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.680
You can also have a mouse. Use the mouse.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.680
Yeah.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.680
Fucking example of one.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.680
Example of one.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.680
I can use a controller. Can we use a controller?

03:45.680 --> 03:46.680
Why would you want...

03:46.680 --> 03:48.680
I don't.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.680
Yes, just begin.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.680
Embark on your journey!

03:54.680 --> 03:56.680
Here's the thing about the person that made this game...

03:58.680 --> 04:00.680
Let me get into what I'm doing, okay?

04:02.680 --> 04:04.680
I learned this game because Camera Lady showed it to me.

04:04.680 --> 04:10.680
And what went down with Camera Lady was Zoe Quinn, the maker of this game, was doing a live stream.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.680
And Camera Lady shows up and she's kind of like watching it and seeing what's going on.

04:14.680 --> 04:20.680
And they talk about Depression Quest and some guy plays Depression Quest and they have this very serious conversation about Depression Quest.

04:21.680 --> 04:35.680
And Camera Lady's like, well listen, I have autism and this does not really describe my experience with depression because people with autism and depression both have completely different symptoms.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.680
Well, yeah.

04:37.680 --> 04:45.680
Because she mentioned people with autism don't become lethargic when they have depression like regular people do.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.680
They just become very disorganized.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.680
Because people with autism are always constantly fucking going.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.680
She's like, no, I have focus now. I didn't have focus before.

04:56.680 --> 05:03.680
So my experience with depression is kind of different from this and she wanted to have a conversation about it.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.680
And then Zoe Quinn just blocked her.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.680
Because she's like, no, do not disagree with my vision.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.680
So, welcome to Zoe Quinn everybody.

05:12.680 --> 05:18.680
Yeah. Okay, so Dev just made sure to sit me down before this.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.680
Yes.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.680
And Camera Lady, she said in the past, you know, there's something that happened before.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.680
Well, Camera Lady showed me what went down with Zoe and then I showed Dev.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
That was kind of the chain of events.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.680
That's always the chain of events.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.680
She mentioned the stuff that happened before. It's just the stuff that happened yesterday.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.680
Mid-20s, I have a girlfriend or boyfriend.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.680
No, it's girlfriend. But also you can be a male or female, but the girl is definitely a girl.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.680
Okay, girl is a girl.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.680
Yeah, girls are girls.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.680
Girls are girls.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.680
Oh yeah, that's true.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.680
That's true.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.680
I kissed a girl and I liked it.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
And I got a job.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
Yeah.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
I got a job.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.680
Okay, I remember when I first played this, I tried to get her to kill herself and she didn't.

06:01.680 --> 06:07.680
Like, I picked every terrible wrong answer and she's like, no, I'm not going to kill myself. I'm just going to be a bum.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.680
I was like, oh, okay.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Well, uh-huh.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
You're a bum rack.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.680
So, this woman that made this game.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.680
Oh, this is a music.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.680
You want a symmetrical Docker breast, Dave?

06:25.680 --> 06:26.680
No.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.680
I'm going to sip my beer.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.680
You sip my Pabst Blue Ribbon.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.680
I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.680
Okay, so Zoe Quinn, Kimberly can provide all the interesting pictures and links to things.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.680
Yeah, she tried to get this on the Green Light Project.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.680
But she did because we're playing it on Steam right now.

06:48.680 --> 06:49.680
Yeah, she did.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.680
And it didn't take.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.680
It only took. It's right here.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.680
Ah, no, here's the thing.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.680
She, it initially didn't take.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.680
Then someone from this troll, this troll wiki.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.680
Yeah, Wizard Champ.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.680
They trolled, well, they trolled Wizard Champ.

07:08.680 --> 07:13.680
It's like basically a bunch of male versions and there's solidarity there, you know, by all means.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.680
A couple of anonymous posters said...

07:18.680 --> 07:19.680
Fuck Zoe Quinn.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.680
I think they said she's a cunt.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.680
And this is something like a place where she never would have gone otherwise.

07:27.680 --> 07:40.680
This troll links her to this forum and then she saw it as a reason to become a victim and utilize that to get Green Light percentages.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.680
A couple of people didn't like Zoe Quinn.

07:44.680 --> 07:51.680
Zoe Quinn then pretended that it was a giant raid on her by the entire 4chan-based internet.

07:52.680 --> 07:57.680
And used that exposure to get like a bunch of people floating and like white knighting for her and...

07:58.680 --> 08:01.680
Oh, by the way, she also has like a bingo on her site where she's like...

08:02.680 --> 08:04.680
One of the panels in the bingo is white knight.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.680
If someone says that someone white knighted for you, check that off your bingo.

08:08.680 --> 08:12.680
Well, Zoe Quinn, if you're watching, you can check it off your bingo because you know what?

08:12.680 --> 08:15.680
Even if that's part of your bingo, people did white knight for you.

08:16.680 --> 08:21.680
You caused a bunch of assholes to show up and watch shitty Netflix.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.680
No, you caused a bunch of assholes to show up and jump to your defense because they were stupid.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.680
And you were just smart enough to make them do it.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.680
Oh, manipulate them enough.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.680
So, she gets Green Light and now she has some e-fame and she has like...

08:36.680 --> 08:46.680
I'm an actual indie games developer and I'm doing stuff and I cut myself open and put fucking microchips underneath my skin because I'm hardcore like that.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.680
And she basically just attention cores another spot in her bingo.

08:51.680 --> 08:57.680
But it's true. It's funny how all the spots in the bingo are actually true criticisms of her as a human being.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.680
Oh, it gets better.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.680
Here's the thing. If a male did this, I'd be just as critical.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.680
Zoe Darham, it's not that you have a vagina. It's that you're a terrible human.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.680
That's where the criticism is coming from.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.680
Yeah, yeah.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.680
Because I would do this to a man. I would call him a terrible piece of shit as well.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.680
Oh, instantly.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.680
I'm gonna call him a bitch.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
You're gonna call him Mumsy? Oh no, you're calling him...

09:28.680 --> 09:29.680
My girl.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.680
Yeah, the girlfriend.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.680
You know what this is? That's the medication I'm taking.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Really?

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
It's exactly the same kind in exactly the same dose.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
Oh.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.680
So do you think Zoe Quinn broke into your house and took a picture of your meds to vote in the game?

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
Yes.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.680
Well, you know, here's the thing. It gets worse.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.680
Yesterday...

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
Yes, yesterday.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Her ex-boyfriend.

09:55.680 --> 10:00.680
She's filming this. It might be two or three days by the time it comes out, because I know Cameron Lee's gonna rush this one out.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.680
Yesterday, her ex-boyfriend shows up on the internets.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.680
With a mountain of evidence.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.680
A mountain of evidence against her, basically showing how she lies, manipulates, cheats on him.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.680
The TLDR. The two of them didn't read. The two of them didn't read.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.680
He calls her burgers and fries. Like five guys burgers and fries.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.680
Because she had sex with five guys.

10:23.680 --> 10:27.680
Two of them when they were broken up, briefly, and three of them while they were still dating.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.680
One of whom was married.

10:30.680 --> 10:35.680
If you're broken up and you're on a break, and you have sex with somebody else, and you get back together with them,

10:36.680 --> 10:40.680
I mean, you didn't cheat on them, because you're on a break. You are free. You're single at that point.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.680
You should tell them when you get back together.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.680
And then, of course, have it, cheating on him with three fucking people.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
That's terrible.

10:50.680 --> 10:54.680
Your buddy on lines? I just found out I got cheated on.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.680
Oh no, that's horrible.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.680
Was Attic dating Zoe Quinn?

11:04.680 --> 11:05.680
Here's the thing, too.

11:06.680 --> 11:12.680
One of the biggest problems that this guy had with her was that she'd always go on this moral high ground.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.680
Especially when they first met and said, oh, cheating of any kind is reprehensible.

11:16.680 --> 11:28.680
It's reprehensible, it's anti-feminist, it's kind of related to rape, because it involves a withdrawal of consent and still doing something behind their back anyway.

11:29.680 --> 11:33.680
It's always not the same as rape, but it involves fucking with consent, so it's kind of in the same category.

11:34.680 --> 11:39.680
She says all this shit, and yet she's a pathological liar, and then she just bangs a bunch of dudes.

11:39.680 --> 11:46.680
The worst part about all of this is that basically everything Zoe Quinn has right now, she got through underhanded means.

11:47.680 --> 12:03.680
In any sort of e-fame, any sort of e-fame, any sort of credibility as this woman feminist queer icon within gaming, all of it, it's all based on her exposing a philosophy that she cannot live herself.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.680
Oh, we finished the game already. What happened? Did we die?

12:07.680 --> 12:08.680
No.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.680
Did we defeat the aliens?

12:11.680 --> 12:18.680
Yes. Okay, so I just did this, I did that, and I did okay. Basically the kind of way that I feel like I'm doing right now.

12:19.680 --> 12:35.680
But as a social worker, it seems like Zoe Quinn is very much the product of a poisonous environment, because the way that her ex talked about her, she had a really shitty upbringing.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.680
That still doesn't excuse doing shitty things, though.

12:39.680 --> 12:45.680
Oh, it doesn't excuse it? It gives context to it. It gives reasoning behind it.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.680
Hey Dave, you should unlock the secret medication.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.680
Do it! Do it! I'm going to try doing the shittiest choices now.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.680
Yeah, just call it the lower ones.

12:58.680 --> 13:06.680
Yeah, like this guy too, he even had a video of him showing his computer and her old Facebook account.

13:07.680 --> 13:24.680
Yeah, showing that it's all real. Also, here's the worst part about it. A regular person, when they get caught in a lie, and they fuck up, if it's a serious lie, they'll break down, they'll cry, they'll beg forgiveness, they'll be sincerely sorry.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.680
And they'll at the very least try to make things better.

13:29.680 --> 13:37.680
Sorry, I just noticed something. The worse your options are, the grayer it gets and the more it looks like there's static. Because that's what it kind of feels like.

13:38.680 --> 13:45.680
And they usually try to make up for it, make it better, do their best. They'll be like, I fucked up.

13:46.680 --> 13:58.680
Someone like Zoe Quinn, when caught in her lies, she becomes very, very remorseful for the things she's been caught in. She doesn't fess up to anything.

13:59.680 --> 14:06.680
She doesn't seriously feel any kind of remorse. She's just doing damage control on herself.

14:06.680 --> 14:15.680
And immediately making new lies to cover the old ones, or try to repair the old ones. There's snowballs on her.

14:16.680 --> 14:29.680
And at the very end of everything, after she's lied about cheating, she's lied about her life philosophy, she's lied about everything she's gained in the gaming community, once that's all been revealed to her now ex as a lie,

14:30.680 --> 14:41.680
her only interactions with him from that point on are to try and ensure he doesn't basically reveal everything. Which he did.

14:42.680 --> 14:50.680
He did. I say good for him. Can we do this in real life so that there's no evidence of what I'm going to say to you? Shit like that, you know?

14:50.680 --> 15:00.680
Yeah, cause I mean, he's not that much of a, I mean, he has amassed a grand amount of evidence, but he doesn't seem like the type of guy, he sounds like a pretty stand up guy.

15:01.680 --> 15:06.680
He's pointing all this stuff out there, but I mean, the guy's been, he's just been jerked around for months.

15:07.680 --> 15:08.680
Oh, you, uh...

15:09.680 --> 15:12.680
Oh, I doubt if that'll kill. I'm going to try to go for middle ground now.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
You're in middle ground.

15:15.680 --> 15:23.680
There across the table, your mother, weekly, meeting her gaze, we're dropping her ass to the floor, you open your mouth to answer but no words come out, you don't even bother pretending to try and think of what to say.

15:24.680 --> 15:29.680
This is like the worst ending where your mom says, are you okay? And you just collapse.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
Yeah.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.680
She doesn't start crying, she just kind of goes...

15:34.680 --> 15:39.680
But no, see, here's the problem. Why doesn't this game have an ending where you kill yourself?

15:40.680 --> 15:46.680
Because that is the ending, that is the worst ending of Depression Quest. Game over.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
Yeah.

15:49.680 --> 15:50.680
So she kind of fucked up.

15:52.680 --> 15:59.680
Well, yeah, this is minor. This is the most minor part of her fucking up.

16:00.680 --> 16:01.680
Yeah, that's true.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.680
Lady, you have...

16:04.680 --> 16:05.680
Go for the best ending this time, dude.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.680
I am.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.680
Yeah, because you're in the middle ground.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.680
They don't allow this, they don't allow you to be going through the best stuff.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.680
No, but you can still work your way to the best possible ending just by being smart about it, right?

16:18.680 --> 16:20.680
Here's the thing, like drinking earnest, maybe?

16:21.680 --> 16:22.680
No.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.680
I don't know, avoid the crowd?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.680
Yeah, avoid the crowd. I avoided the crowd when I got my best ending.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.680
She's like, thanks for coming, sweetheart.

16:32.680 --> 16:37.680
Anyway, oh, by the way, the writing is not really that good in this game.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.680
It's okay, it's passable, it gets the point across.

16:42.680 --> 16:43.680
It's utilitarian.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.680
Yeah, it does what it needs to do.

16:46.680 --> 16:47.680
Yeah, get the cat.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
Oh, yeah.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.680
How do you like camera lady's dog?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.680
It's always easy to be happy to see me whenever I go downstairs.

16:57.680 --> 17:01.680
Does it hump your leg? Does it blow its load inside of your...

17:02.680 --> 17:03.680
Inside of my leg?

17:04.680 --> 17:05.680
No, inside of your...

17:06.680 --> 17:07.680
Inside of my butthole?

17:08.680 --> 17:09.680
Your butthole, really.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.680
No, I actually don't know if it's male or female.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.680
Yeah, you have to notice that your hands are shaking so she'll help you at this point.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.680
Yeah.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680
And then you go to therapy and things are okay.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
And then teeth grinding.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.680
Yeah, just be honest about everything.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.680
This lying is bad.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.680
Lying is bad.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.680
You should probably learn the lesson here at your own game.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.680
What the fuck, man?

17:30.680 --> 17:37.680
If you play this game and it's not bad, the intent is actually very honorable, then why?

17:38.680 --> 17:39.680
You know what I think?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.680
Is that the other people, she programmed it and the other people just wrote it.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.680
Programmed it?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.680
You mean made an HTML page and clicked through links?

17:48.680 --> 17:49.680
Yeah.

17:50.680 --> 17:51.680
Something I could do when I was 12 years old?

17:52.680 --> 17:53.680
I got the best ending.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.680
No.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
Did you lose?

17:58.680 --> 17:59.680
No, you didn't. No, it's not.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.680
I'm good, man.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.680
Really? Because I remember doing one where I actually was able to move in with Alex.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.680
Didn't you?

18:08.680 --> 18:09.680
Well, I don't think so.

18:10.680 --> 18:11.680
Let's see, let's see.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.680
Doing the job?

18:14.680 --> 18:15.680
The biggest change in your life has been your relationship with Alex.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.680
You're terrified about it?

18:18.680 --> 18:19.680
Yeah.

18:20.680 --> 18:21.680
Yeah, you're thinking about it but you're not actually doing it.

18:22.680 --> 18:23.680
Oh, you did? You didn't get the best ending?

18:24.680 --> 18:25.680
Oh, no.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.680
You got to print in the Contra code for this motherfucker.

18:28.680 --> 18:29.680
God damn it.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
Okay.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.680
The game sucks.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.680
To finish up our Depression Quest episode, Zoe doesn't follow her own philosophy, obviously.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.680
No, she's very, very, very hypocritical.

18:40.680 --> 18:49.680
Regarding feminism, regarding consent, regarding love, regarding relationships, regarding being an interesting game developer, regarding any kind of decent morality.

18:49.680 --> 19:01.680
A lot of the stuff she has is basically based on a lie because she straight up fucked her way up through the ranks rather than actually...

19:02.680 --> 19:03.680
Or lied. Play the victim.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.680
Yeah, play the victim. Basically anything other than get their own merit.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.680
I think it's a sad state when a person has to use evidence from their own relationship.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.680
But it's a high profile thing now because she's made herself well known through...

19:17.680 --> 19:28.680
One of the most overwhelming opinions on Twitter is, I never liked Zoe. I couldn't pinpoint why. Now I know.

19:29.680 --> 19:36.680
There was something a bit too fake about how she acted in her YouTube videos and her livestream. There was something too fake about it but I couldn't figure it out.

19:37.680 --> 19:42.680
Now I have the full picture. Now I understand what kind of person Zoe Quinn actually is.

19:42.680 --> 19:56.680
And yeah, it's truly a shame because there are real female queer icons out there who should be front and center in their fight to get recognized in the gaming industry.

19:57.680 --> 20:03.680
And here she is, doing this bullshit. Dave, you gotta unlock the golden mouse cursor.

20:03.680 --> 20:20.680
Here's a great example. Machinima, the YouTube network. They will not speak in written form or on Skype if the Skype call is being recorded for their contracts for YouTube channels.

20:21.680 --> 20:28.680
Zoe Quinn is acting like machinima in their business dealings. They're shady, underhanded, everyone hates machinima business dealings.

20:29.680 --> 20:37.680
And Zoe Quinn is doing the same thing. And she turns around and is like, no, I don't want there to be any more evidence of what I'm doing. Please don't release this because it would ruin my life.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.680
I don't care that I actually trampled over you, but this would hurt me so let me try to convince you.

20:42.680 --> 20:51.680
She is, I guess to finish it off, she's like a truly heartless human being. She is sociopathic, at least in her actions.

20:52.680 --> 21:09.680
It definitely comes across as sociopathic. At the very least it comes across as someone that has sociopathic tendencies because of being raised in a poisonous environment.

21:09.680 --> 21:20.680
I'll end it with this. I'll end our episode with this. The only reason we even deal with this, because usually we don't talk about too much internet drama on this show. We just kind of just play games and watch anime and have fun.

21:21.680 --> 21:36.680
The main reason we do this today is because Zoe treated camera lady like such shit. Camera lady comes to me yesterday or whatever and is like, you gotta see this. We gotta put out a video. And I was like, okay, let's fucking do it.

21:37.680 --> 21:45.680
You know what I think is the worst kind of hell? Having to do this game over and over again. That's my Sisyphean hellishness.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.680
You know what I think the worst kind of hell would probably be? Having to deal with Zoe Quinn.

21:51.680 --> 22:00.680
You know what the worst part is? The absolute worst part is? On the off chance should Zoe actually watch this video? You know what she'll say?

22:00.680 --> 22:07.680
What's that? These are just some white guys. So obviously what they're saying has no very own reality. Even though I've been honest?

22:08.680 --> 22:24.680
That's how social justice words kind of just discredit their opponents. They just pick out by what barometer they may be part of a majority in society. Like a privileged majority and just say, oh you're that. Obviously nothing you say is valid.

22:24.680 --> 22:44.680
Dude, there was a controversy like a couple weeks ago where JonTron said the word retired. And people said he looks white. Even though he's not white, he looks white. Therefore any objection he has to our criticism is rendered invalid.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.680
Even though he's not white, he's Persian.

22:49.680 --> 22:55.680
Let's get this shit out of here. Goodbye. Fuck you Depression Quest. You're a bad video game.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
Alright, alright.

22:58.680 --> 23:05.680
Stop, stop. I can't, I can't. I'm too depressed. I'm in a glass cage. Oh no. Shut up.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.680
Ah.

23:36.680 --> 23:37.680
Ah.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.680
Ah.

24:14.680 --> 24:15.680
Ah.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.680
Ah.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.680
Ah.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.680
Ah.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.680
Ah.
