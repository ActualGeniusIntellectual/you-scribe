WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
Hey guys, I'm just back from the gym, and since we've been inactive since the start

00:03.360 --> 00:06.600
of the new year, I figured I'd give you a quick update vlog.

00:06.600 --> 00:10.320
And since I know about four fifths of our subscriber base is interested in the gamergate

00:10.320 --> 00:15.300
and SJW stuff, I'll get to that news right away.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.800
The plan is to bring back those videos, the discussion vlogs, the SJW stuff, the indefensible

00:20.800 --> 00:27.640
when relevant, on February 8th, mark that on your calendar, and to do 1-2 of them a

00:27.640 --> 00:28.640
week.

00:28.640 --> 00:34.680
Furthermore, this channel, youtube.com slash shortfat otaku, going forward will only be

00:34.680 --> 00:36.600
hosting that type of content.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.680
Meaning, if you're subscribed to us only for that type of stuff, and you don't want your

00:40.680 --> 00:45.200
subscription list being bogged down by all of our other projects, from now on, this channel

00:45.200 --> 00:47.340
will only host those videos.

00:47.340 --> 00:51.080
The main reason for this change is basically because we're catching up with how YouTube

00:51.080 --> 00:53.080
runs nowadays.

00:53.080 --> 00:58.600
When we started in 2008 and 2009, having multiple channels for multiple projects was just a

00:58.640 --> 00:59.760
little bit unheard of.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.280
If you were a YouTuber, you put your stuff on one centralized channel so that everyone

01:04.280 --> 01:05.840
could see what you were doing.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.960
And if you look at some of these successful older YouTubers, like the Angry Video Game

01:08.960 --> 01:12.720
Nerd, you'll see he still does this to some extent, but the way that search algorithms

01:12.720 --> 01:16.900
work on YouTube now, and the way that YouTube will actually hide videos that you're subscribed

01:16.900 --> 01:21.120
to based on how often you actually go to that channel, that style of YouTubing just isn't

01:21.120 --> 01:22.200
viable anymore.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.180
I think this is something that Sargon was trying to tell us about six months ago on

01:25.180 --> 01:31.360
one of his streams, and also Rerez over on RerezTV came in and gave us a lot of pointers.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.580
Now of course I would like you guys to watch all of our projects, but to those of you who

01:35.580 --> 01:40.940
are subscribed only to this specific type of content, the SJW stuff, and the Gamergate

01:40.940 --> 01:44.920
stuff, and all of that, and you're not really here to have your feed flooded by our other

01:44.920 --> 01:48.960
daily uploads, I would like to say, I'm sorry.

01:48.960 --> 01:53.300
I hope you'll stick around, because the stuff that you want to see is coming, and from now

01:53.300 --> 01:58.040
on this channel will only host that stuff.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.740
That being said, No Talent Gaming isn't going away, it's just being given its own channel,

02:01.740 --> 02:04.100
and you can see it right here.

02:04.100 --> 02:08.340
The No Talent Gaming daily uploads will be returning on February 1st, and additionally

02:08.340 --> 02:13.620
our entire backlog of No Talent Gaming videos have also been mirrored over on that channel.

02:13.620 --> 02:17.920
We will eventually take them off this channel, but not until we've given people enough time

02:17.920 --> 02:19.900
to go over and check out the new channel.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.540
So if you feel like rewatching an old series, or you haven't heard of No Talent Gaming,

02:23.540 --> 02:26.820
or you just want to check out some of the games we've done, please watch the backlog

02:26.820 --> 02:28.420
over on that channel.

02:28.420 --> 02:31.860
And if you feel like leaving some comments or just redoing some of your old comments

02:31.860 --> 02:34.240
or whatever, please do it over there.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.720
With the new No Talent Gaming channel, there will be some changes in how we do the videos.

02:38.720 --> 02:44.060
Those changes are detailed in this video here, but basically we're just trying to streamline

02:44.060 --> 02:47.820
the videos, clean them up a little bit, make it easier to watch overall.

02:47.820 --> 02:51.820
So if you like the idea of us doing Let's Plays and looking at video game content, but

02:51.820 --> 02:58.180
you just really couldn't stomach our old format, please take a look at some of the new stuff.

02:58.180 --> 03:02.620
And now I'm sure there's some of you saying, but Devin, SFO started as an anime review

03:02.620 --> 03:04.740
channel, and yes it did.

03:04.740 --> 03:09.960
But frankly, after running the analytics on our channel, like which of our subs comes

03:09.960 --> 03:14.880
to watch which kind of videos, our anime review audience is almost completely gone.

03:14.880 --> 03:19.280
Four fifths of our audience is here for Gamergate and for Social Justice, about one fifth is

03:19.280 --> 03:23.960
here for No Talent Gaming, and there's only like less than one percent that still cares

03:23.960 --> 03:25.300
about the anime reviews.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.240
That doesn't mean we're stopping them though.

03:27.240 --> 03:32.900
The anime reviews are returning on February 22nd with a review of One Punch Man, and that

03:32.900 --> 03:35.000
series will also have its own channel.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.240
We will be cross-promoting our channels from time to time so that you at least know of

03:38.240 --> 03:41.880
the existence of them, but feel free to only subscribe to the ones that you're actually

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
interested in.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.480
I'd also like to add a disclaimer here.

03:44.480 --> 03:48.400
If you decide to go over and check out some of those new channels right away, like right

03:48.400 --> 03:53.680
when this video comes up, they still might be a little bit roughshod, we're still kind

03:53.680 --> 03:54.880
of putting them together.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.700
So please excuse things that are under construction, and if you see any kind of problems or mislabeled

04:00.700 --> 04:05.080
videos or things in a wrong order in a playlist or something, just leave a comment and we'll

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
fix it.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.360
Anyway, that's what's going on with us.

04:08.360 --> 04:13.320
With those three dates on your calendar, February 1st, February 8th, and February 22nd, please

04:13.320 --> 04:17.960
check out all of our videos and all of our new content and all of our new channels, and

04:17.960 --> 04:18.800
thanks a lot for watching.
