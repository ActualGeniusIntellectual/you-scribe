00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Hey guys, I'm just back from the gym, and since we've been inactive since the start

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,600
of the new year, I figured I'd give you a quick update vlog.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,320
And since I know about four fifths of our subscriber base is interested in the gamergate

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,300
and SJW stuff, I'll get to that news right away.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,800
The plan is to bring back those videos, the discussion vlogs, the SJW stuff, the indefensible

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,640
when relevant, on February 8th, mark that on your calendar, and to do 1-2 of them a

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
week.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,680
Furthermore, this channel, youtube.com slash shortfat otaku, going forward will only be

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,600
hosting that type of content.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,680
Meaning, if you're subscribed to us only for that type of stuff, and you don't want your

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,200
subscription list being bogged down by all of our other projects, from now on, this channel

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,340
will only host those videos.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,080
The main reason for this change is basically because we're catching up with how YouTube

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,080
runs nowadays.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,600
When we started in 2008 and 2009, having multiple channels for multiple projects was just a

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,760
little bit unheard of.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,280
If you were a YouTuber, you put your stuff on one centralized channel so that everyone

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,840
could see what you were doing.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
And if you look at some of these successful older YouTubers, like the Angry Video Game

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,720
Nerd, you'll see he still does this to some extent, but the way that search algorithms

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,900
work on YouTube now, and the way that YouTube will actually hide videos that you're subscribed

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,120
to based on how often you actually go to that channel, that style of YouTubing just isn't

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,200
viable anymore.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,180
I think this is something that Sargon was trying to tell us about six months ago on

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,360
one of his streams, and also Rerez over on RerezTV came in and gave us a lot of pointers.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,580
Now of course I would like you guys to watch all of our projects, but to those of you who

27
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,940
are subscribed only to this specific type of content, the SJW stuff, and the Gamergate

28
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,920
stuff, and all of that, and you're not really here to have your feed flooded by our other

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,960
daily uploads, I would like to say, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,300
I hope you'll stick around, because the stuff that you want to see is coming, and from now

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,040
on this channel will only host that stuff.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,740
That being said, No Talent Gaming isn't going away, it's just being given its own channel,

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,100
and you can see it right here.

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,340
The No Talent Gaming daily uploads will be returning on February 1st, and additionally

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,620
our entire backlog of No Talent Gaming videos have also been mirrored over on that channel.

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,920
We will eventually take them off this channel, but not until we've given people enough time

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,900
to go over and check out the new channel.

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,540
So if you feel like rewatching an old series, or you haven't heard of No Talent Gaming,

39
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,820
or you just want to check out some of the games we've done, please watch the backlog

40
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,420
over on that channel.

41
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,860
And if you feel like leaving some comments or just redoing some of your old comments

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,240
or whatever, please do it over there.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,720
With the new No Talent Gaming channel, there will be some changes in how we do the videos.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,060
Those changes are detailed in this video here, but basically we're just trying to streamline

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,820
the videos, clean them up a little bit, make it easier to watch overall.

46
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,820
So if you like the idea of us doing Let's Plays and looking at video game content, but

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:58,180
you just really couldn't stomach our old format, please take a look at some of the new stuff.

48
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,620
And now I'm sure there's some of you saying, but Devin, SFO started as an anime review

49
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,740
channel, and yes it did.

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,960
But frankly, after running the analytics on our channel, like which of our subs comes

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,880
to watch which kind of videos, our anime review audience is almost completely gone.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,280
Four fifths of our audience is here for Gamergate and for Social Justice, about one fifth is

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,960
here for No Talent Gaming, and there's only like less than one percent that still cares

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,300
about the anime reviews.

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,240
That doesn't mean we're stopping them though.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,900
The anime reviews are returning on February 22nd with a review of One Punch Man, and that

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,000
series will also have its own channel.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,240
We will be cross-promoting our channels from time to time so that you at least know of

59
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,880
the existence of them, but feel free to only subscribe to the ones that you're actually

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
interested in.

61
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,480
I'd also like to add a disclaimer here.

62
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,400
If you decide to go over and check out some of those new channels right away, like right

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
when this video comes up, they still might be a little bit roughshod, we're still kind

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,880
of putting them together.

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,700
So please excuse things that are under construction, and if you see any kind of problems or mislabeled

66
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,080
videos or things in a wrong order in a playlist or something, just leave a comment and we'll

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
fix it.

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,360
Anyway, that's what's going on with us.

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,320
With those three dates on your calendar, February 1st, February 8th, and February 22nd, please

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,960
check out all of our videos and all of our new content and all of our new channels, and

71
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,800
thanks a lot for watching.
