0	3360	Hey guys, I'm just back from the gym, and since we've been inactive since the start
3360	6600	of the new year, I figured I'd give you a quick update vlog.
6600	10320	And since I know about four fifths of our subscriber base is interested in the gamergate
10320	15300	and SJW stuff, I'll get to that news right away.
15300	20800	The plan is to bring back those videos, the discussion vlogs, the SJW stuff, the indefensible
20800	27640	when relevant, on February 8th, mark that on your calendar, and to do 1-2 of them a
27640	28640	week.
28640	34680	Furthermore, this channel, youtube.com slash shortfat otaku, going forward will only be
34680	36600	hosting that type of content.
36600	40680	Meaning, if you're subscribed to us only for that type of stuff, and you don't want your
40680	45200	subscription list being bogged down by all of our other projects, from now on, this channel
45200	47340	will only host those videos.
47340	51080	The main reason for this change is basically because we're catching up with how YouTube
51080	53080	runs nowadays.
53080	58600	When we started in 2008 and 2009, having multiple channels for multiple projects was just a
58640	59760	little bit unheard of.
59760	64280	If you were a YouTuber, you put your stuff on one centralized channel so that everyone
64280	65840	could see what you were doing.
65840	68960	And if you look at some of these successful older YouTubers, like the Angry Video Game
68960	72720	Nerd, you'll see he still does this to some extent, but the way that search algorithms
72720	76900	work on YouTube now, and the way that YouTube will actually hide videos that you're subscribed
76900	81120	to based on how often you actually go to that channel, that style of YouTubing just isn't
81120	82200	viable anymore.
82200	85180	I think this is something that Sargon was trying to tell us about six months ago on
85180	91360	one of his streams, and also Rerez over on RerezTV came in and gave us a lot of pointers.
91360	95580	Now of course I would like you guys to watch all of our projects, but to those of you who
95580	100940	are subscribed only to this specific type of content, the SJW stuff, and the Gamergate
100940	104920	stuff, and all of that, and you're not really here to have your feed flooded by our other
104920	108960	daily uploads, I would like to say, I'm sorry.
108960	113300	I hope you'll stick around, because the stuff that you want to see is coming, and from now
113300	118040	on this channel will only host that stuff.
118040	121740	That being said, No Talent Gaming isn't going away, it's just being given its own channel,
121740	124100	and you can see it right here.
124100	128340	The No Talent Gaming daily uploads will be returning on February 1st, and additionally
128340	133620	our entire backlog of No Talent Gaming videos have also been mirrored over on that channel.
133620	137920	We will eventually take them off this channel, but not until we've given people enough time
137920	139900	to go over and check out the new channel.
139900	143540	So if you feel like rewatching an old series, or you haven't heard of No Talent Gaming,
143540	146820	or you just want to check out some of the games we've done, please watch the backlog
146820	148420	over on that channel.
148420	151860	And if you feel like leaving some comments or just redoing some of your old comments
151860	154240	or whatever, please do it over there.
154240	158720	With the new No Talent Gaming channel, there will be some changes in how we do the videos.
158720	164060	Those changes are detailed in this video here, but basically we're just trying to streamline
164060	167820	the videos, clean them up a little bit, make it easier to watch overall.
167820	171820	So if you like the idea of us doing Let's Plays and looking at video game content, but
171820	178180	you just really couldn't stomach our old format, please take a look at some of the new stuff.
178180	182620	And now I'm sure there's some of you saying, but Devin, SFO started as an anime review
182620	184740	channel, and yes it did.
184740	189960	But frankly, after running the analytics on our channel, like which of our subs comes
189960	194880	to watch which kind of videos, our anime review audience is almost completely gone.
194880	199280	Four fifths of our audience is here for Gamergate and for Social Justice, about one fifth is
199280	203960	here for No Talent Gaming, and there's only like less than one percent that still cares
203960	205300	about the anime reviews.
205300	207240	That doesn't mean we're stopping them though.
207240	212900	The anime reviews are returning on February 22nd with a review of One Punch Man, and that
212900	215000	series will also have its own channel.
215000	218240	We will be cross-promoting our channels from time to time so that you at least know of
218240	221880	the existence of them, but feel free to only subscribe to the ones that you're actually
221880	222880	interested in.
222880	224480	I'd also like to add a disclaimer here.
224480	228400	If you decide to go over and check out some of those new channels right away, like right
228400	233680	when this video comes up, they still might be a little bit roughshod, we're still kind
233680	234880	of putting them together.
234880	240700	So please excuse things that are under construction, and if you see any kind of problems or mislabeled
240700	245080	videos or things in a wrong order in a playlist or something, just leave a comment and we'll
245080	246080	fix it.
246080	248360	Anyway, that's what's going on with us.
248360	253320	With those three dates on your calendar, February 1st, February 8th, and February 22nd, please
253320	257960	check out all of our videos and all of our new content and all of our new channels, and
257960	258800	thanks a lot for watching.
