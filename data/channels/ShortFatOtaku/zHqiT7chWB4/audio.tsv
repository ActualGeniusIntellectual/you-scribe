0	9680	Oh, yeah, guys, I got some new audio equipment, specifically, I picked up a preamp because
9680	14100	you know that microphone, that one microphone that every single YouTuber uses and how it
14100	18480	always sounds really shit because either they'll move their mouth away and they'll basically
18480	21960	disappear or alternatively, they'll get too close to the microphone, they'll just peek
21960	22960	like crazy.
22960	27180	Yeah, nobody seems to know this, but that mic really only works if you install a preamp
27180	28760	and I did install a preamp.
28760	31040	So hopefully things sound a little bit better.
31040	33040	Yes, I know it took me two years to do it, shut up.
33040	34040	But today we are talking about rentals.
34040	36920	You know, you got to rent a house, maybe you got to rent an apartment, everyone needs a
36920	37920	place to live, right?
37920	40440	Well, this post went viral on Christmas Day.
40440	44560	In fact, check out the absolute state of the rental market in New York City.
44560	50160	Must be queer, NB or trans, person of color preferred, considerate about the space and
50160	55160	other people in the building, especially regarding COVID safety, willing to build space and keep
55160	59860	the apartment clean together, communicative, vaccinated and 24 plus preferred.
59860	61940	This is an anti capitalism household.
61940	64300	If you identify as a liberal, we won't be a good fit.
64300	68160	Rent is $925 plus utilities for BIPOC.
68160	72320	That means black indigenous person of color under why you said BIPOC here, but you said
72320	77560	only person of color at the start $975 plus utilities for all others.
77560	81040	All others meaning white people, obviously, unless they're counting Asians and Jews in
81040	83840	there now, which hey, given the state of the left, who knows?
83840	88880	Feel free to email me if you have any question, hashtag support BDS, what's BDS?
88880	91320	Hashtag free Palestine, hashtag abolish Israel.
91320	93800	Yeah, they're not expecting any Jews living here.
93800	97880	Hashtag land back, hashtag resist colonialism, hashtag global solidarity.
97880	100720	Now when I first saw this, I was wondering, how are they getting away with this?
100720	101720	Like, isn't this illegal?
101720	106820	Isn't it illegal to open the advertise that you won't bring in cis people or white people
106820	110320	into into your rental space, but it turns out these people are subletting.
110320	113640	They've already rented the apartment, they just want somebody else to move in with them.
113680	117920	And when you're subletting, that's legal because you're not a business the way that the apartment
117920	118920	owner is a business.
118920	119920	So okay, fair enough.
119920	124720	They will hunt their anti capitalist roommate for their little hellhole in New York.
124720	125720	Okay.
125720	126720	I understand.
126720	127720	I gotta ask here.
127720	131840	What is willing to build space mean like the sentence here?
131840	133920	Willing to build space and keep the apartment clean together.
133920	134920	We'll keep the apartment clean.
134920	136020	Okay, that's normal.
136020	138260	But willing to build space.
138260	139260	What do you what are you fucking doing?
139260	142320	Are you knocking down a wall and like colonizing somebody else's apartment?
142320	144040	That doesn't that doesn't sound very progressive of you.
144040	147880	Or maybe you're like opening the windows up and building a new room out off the side of
147880	148880	the building.
148880	152400	If you're building space that what the fuck do you mean build space?
152400	155020	This just honestly sounds like some hippie dippie bullshit.
155020	159280	It sounds like the stuff that I would hear when I was taking like intro to critical theory
159280	161000	during my second year of university.
161000	164720	And see, they say you must be queer and be your trans and POC preferred.
164720	168440	So they will take a white person if they have to, but they're not gonna take a cis person.
168440	170120	So imagine being a white trans woman.
170120	173760	You know, you're down on your luck, you're looking for a place, you come across this,
173760	177880	this listing, and they're like, you know what that white privilege, you got to pay $50 more
177880	180720	Geez, it just it sounds so ridiculous.
180720	182520	These people are legitimately bigoted.
182520	187480	And you know what, I'm not even dogging on people who want some kind of rental with people
187480	191280	who are like them, whether that be racial, whether that be sexual, whether that be gender
191280	195200	specific, like, fine, you like what you like, like here, check this out.
195200	200000	This seems to be a reasonable way to put this looking to rent or lease with a queer friendly
200040	201040	roommate.
201040	203480	Hey, I'm looking around for roommates who are queer friendly and cat friendly.
203480	207960	I would have one cat who is very shy and would be paying rent through my substituting job.
207960	208960	My phone number is available.
208960	209960	My service is bad.
209960	210960	Okay.
210960	211960	But still, like, look at this.
211960	212960	It's just it's just a normal thing.
212960	213960	It's like, listen, I'm queer.
213960	216200	I don't know if that means that if they're gay or if they're bi or if they're trans or
216200	219520	there's something there and they're like, I need somebody who will accommodate me.
219520	220520	Fair enough.
220520	223260	There's none of this crazy fucking nonsense.
223260	224840	It's just hey, this is what I need.
224840	225840	Okay.
225840	226840	And you know what?
226840	227840	You find somebody who will fit you.
227840	228840	Great.
228880	229880	But yeah.
229880	230880	Well, then you guys keep looking.
230880	231880	That's okay.
231880	232880	That is.
232880	233880	This is the beauty of the free market.
233880	237400	Letting people state their preferences and then try to find those who match with them
237400	238400	willingly.
238400	240360	Here's the hellish version of this very same thing.
240360	244720	Nine hundred dollars and a three bedroom queer creative house with a backyard.
244720	247120	Cutie BIPOC prioritize and encourage.
247120	249120	What does this mean?
249120	250120	OK.
250120	251120	BIPOC.
251120	252120	We got that before.
252120	254640	Do you mean like cutie as you find them attractive?
254640	256360	Like maybe it's maybe it's queer trans.
256360	259280	You need like a fucking decryption key to figure this stuff out.
259280	263000	Hey, folks, we've got one bedroom available in our sunny Oakland community care centered
263000	264000	house.
264000	265760	It's off High Street, East Lake, huge grassy backyard.
265760	268840	As you read this, you realize it just sounds like a regular house, you know, and then you
268840	270680	get down to about us.
270680	276760	See they them queer and be white, 28 community minded and lover of honest, compassionate
276760	277760	communication.
277760	281400	In other words, that sounds like somebody who will just shit on you and say, oh, I'm
281400	282520	just being honest.
282520	283520	I'm just brutally honest.
283520	284520	That's how I am.
284520	286040	Darling works from home.
286040	289720	Making digital content for labor organizing and working on alternatives to the police.
289720	294120	OK, so if they're getting paid, they run an account like Rose City Antifa.
294120	298580	They're social, sensitive and passionate and come alive when skating, letting their freak
298580	303640	flag fly on the dance floor, floating in the water, making magic and community and in deep
303640	305120	convos about liberation.
305120	306920	Can you imagine like you come home from work?
306920	308680	You just want to fucking go to your room.
308680	311400	Maybe, you know, play some video games, eat some food, watch whatever the fuck.
311400	314600	And you got this person knock on your door.
314600	315600	Excuse me.
315600	317720	It's time for our Marxist talk and liberation.
317720	319400	Can you please come out into the kitchen?
319400	320400	It's like fuck off.
320400	321400	I want to sleep.
321400	327880	E is they them queer plus non-binary and trans, white 31 spends most of their time organizing
327880	331360	to break up corporate power and help create new food systems.
331360	335480	I guarantee you the only food system this person cares about is the one that starts
335480	337380	at their mouth and ends at their asshole.
337380	338380	Break up corporate.
338380	339680	You guys don't know how to fucking farm.
339680	340680	You live in a big city.
340680	342320	It's gonna be like Chaz all over again.
342320	344400	Remember those sad little plants they had going?
344400	346240	They can't feed the city block on that shit.
346240	351640	They like drawing, practicing magic with friends or are they Wiccan, I guess?
351640	352640	They're vegan.
352640	353640	They're learning to tattoo.
353640	354640	They work from home and they like to skate.
354640	358520	They like to socialize, especially through art and dance, but also likes quiet time alone
358520	359520	to recharge.
359520	362260	Oh God, both of these people work from home.
362260	364160	This sounds almost intolerable.
364160	368720	And then finally there's B, a sweet magical kitten whose eyes hold secrets to the universe.
368720	373100	Assuming that's actually a cat like a pet and not just, you know, a woman who calls
373100	374300	herself kitten.
374300	376080	That might be the most acceptable person there.
376080	379960	It's important to all of us that we are actively working to decolonize our minds and create
379960	382700	a world where liberation is possible for all people.
382700	384260	Black trans lives matter.
384260	385820	If you don't agree, we aren't a good fit.
385820	387100	Listen, you want to be liberated?
387100	388360	Don't live in a house like this.
388360	392480	One room is available in an LGBT POC friendly shared home.
392480	393940	There's already three roommates there.
393940	395540	One is S in her forties.
395540	399100	She and they, she's an award-winning performer and yoga instructor.
399100	403300	Jesus, what, what performance are you given that you're also a yoga instructor on the
403300	404300	bed?
404300	406860	Do you teach the best yoga class in town or something B forties?
406860	410780	He him works in education with limited exposure to the public, enjoys cooking, tabletop gaming,
410780	411780	theater and music.
411780	412780	Oh God.
412780	413780	Imagine joining this guy's tabletop game.
413780	416860	You have to sign one of those tabletop consent forms.
416860	420420	Maybe you got to hear about how orcs are black coded and therefore racist.
420420	421420	D forties.
421420	425300	He him works in tech with limited exposure to coworkers and these guys are all in their
425300	426300	forties.
426300	430140	Like, fuck, imagine having a roommate even, even then, and like not living with your girl
430140	431140	or something.
431140	434860	That doesn't sound kind of critical because currently in my house, we've got me, we've
434860	437260	got Naomi, my girlfriend, and we've got Dave, my friends.
437260	438820	So he, he is the third wheel.
438820	439820	He's the roommate.
439820	442460	But the difference is I've known Dave since I was four years old.
442460	447340	I would, at my age, I would not be tolerating just having randoms move into my place.
447340	448340	Fuck.
448340	450000	No, I'm not 19 anymore.
450000	454460	We are looking for someone who is serious about practicing COVID safety, LGBT queer
454460	456580	and POC encouraged to apply.
456580	460420	We are friendly hermits who love our cats and chickens in the back yard.
460420	462860	You guys, you guys are raising chickens back there.
462860	465940	Fucking imagine after like a hard week at work, you come home, you just want to hang
465940	469500	out, maybe sit out in the back porch with a coffee on Saturday morning, try to have
469500	470980	just like a little bit of peace.
470980	473460	And then suddenly a whole bunch of chickens come up and start pecking your fucking feet.
473460	474460	Check out this rental.
474460	475460	This one's from Portland.
475460	478500	We are anti-cop, anti-authoritarian and lean towards a collective structure.
478500	480420	The house is currently half BIPOC.
480420	483460	An understanding of structural white supremacy is necessary.
483460	488660	House is somethings and mostly queer and trans like to craft, cook and bake, maintain relationships
488660	489660	with one another.
489660	494220	Read, do political projects, have bonfires in the back yard and garden, witchy, kink
494220	495980	and sex worker positive.
495980	498820	Add green in the subject heading to ensure the entire ad was read.
498820	501340	You got to give these guys a secret code for they'll let you in.
501340	504900	We are looking for housemates that are able to communicate directly, listen and respect
504900	506280	to those boundaries and needs.
506280	509420	We have monthly meetings and have discussions about COVID risk.
509420	510420	Okay.
510420	512560	I was joking about the Marxist meetings earlier.
512560	515940	That was a gag on my part, but all these people were like, it's time for you to come to the
515940	517500	monthly meeting, dear.
517500	518500	Knock, knock, knock, knock.
518500	519500	God damn it.
519500	520500	Karen.
520500	521500	I just pulled, came off a night shift with me.
521500	525860	If I can see no monthly COVID meeting, they have their meetings about COVID consent and
525860	526860	harm reduction.
526860	527860	Oh God.
527860	528860	A monthly meetings about consent.
528860	530020	Um, excuse me.
530020	534620	So I saw that you brought a girl to the house last week or did you make sure that you obtained
534620	535620	her consent?
535620	538580	We were listening in through the door and we didn't hear her explicitly.
538580	539580	Give consent.
539580	540760	Did she sign a consent form?
540760	542980	This sounds like it would be fucking hell to live in.
542980	545700	You know what lean towards a collective structure means.
545700	548020	That means that your room isn't actually your room.
548540	551940	You want some private space where it's you in exclusivity who owns the location.
551940	552940	No, man.
552940	554220	It's all collectively owned.
554220	558060	This ad reads like you're paying for the privilege of having a fucking commissar run your life.
558060	563500	The most famous version of this sort of thing happening was back in May of 2021 when this
563500	568500	ad rental for a Portland Antifa whorehouse went viral on Twitter.
568500	572320	Rent is three Oh two per month and eight by eight, that's a very big eight by eight.
572320	573320	Okay with noise.
573320	576100	You're located off of the living room and by the front door, so you will hear a lot
576100	577100	of traffic.
577180	580460	The walls don't extend all the way to the ceiling, so you'll hear a lot of stuff.
580460	581460	Jesus.
581460	582980	You have to be okay with sex workers.
582980	586480	We have three in our house and frequently have loud sex.
586480	589420	You couldn't pay me three Oh two to take this fucking room.
589420	590420	Holy shit.
590420	593060	Here's a picture of the room and oh my God, look at this.
593060	595400	They literally took a section of their living room.
595400	596820	They put up folding doors.
596820	600540	You know the doors that kind of accordion themselves closed and open on some on some
600540	601540	closets.
601540	605300	They just stuck those up and then they put a curtain and there's your fucking room for
605300	607580	three hundred and two dollars a month.
607580	610020	You can live in a literal hole in the wall.
610020	611820	Here's what the rest of the rental ad read.
611820	613500	You have to be a cab.
613500	614760	All cops are bastards.
614760	615760	Don't be ableist.
615760	619340	Don't be racist or homophobic, transphobic or a misogynist and then it talks about the
619340	624260	sex worker stuff and then whoever moves in must also have little to no belongings and
624260	629720	be okay with the home being used to host homeless people on the couch.
629720	633580	So let me get this straight for you to pay for your tiny slice of this house literally
633580	635120	carved out for you.
635120	637160	You got to pay three hundred and two dollars for that.
637160	640160	But the bum down the street who's shooting up heroin, he can come in and sleep on the
640160	641160	couch.
641160	642160	No problem.
642160	643160	Scott free.
643160	644160	I can't fucking believe this dude.
644160	649400	The location is called the Creatures Co-op and Creatures Co-op is run by Brandy Jo Taylor
649400	650400	Fish.
650400	654320	She seems to spend her time fundraising for Antifa specifically to get enough money to
654320	656840	bail out people who were charged during riots.
656840	661320	Fish's partner, Ribbity Raggedy, yes, that's her name, is one of the sex workers living
661320	662320	at the house.
662320	666200	By golly, wouldn't you want to spend your evenings with nothing but a curtain between
666200	669840	you and the outside listening to these people have sex all night long?
669840	672000	Well fuck, just sign me up there.
672000	674160	Just fuck my entire life up, dude.
674160	679280	This video here went viral around the same time of a 20 year old full blown narcissism
679280	684040	project getting kicked out of her place by her parents who just don't understand what
684040	685880	it's like to be a young person nowadays.
685880	688040	You legally have to give me a month.
688040	692240	No, I don't because you haven't paid one brown penny.
692560	696400	I'm not obligated to and I can't afford to.
696400	697400	Guess what?
697400	699400	It doesn't matter.
699400	704280	You can't just tell me I have two weeks to find somewhere.
704280	708200	You've had over a month and- No, I haven't!
708200	713880	Look, you have done nothing but dig your heels in and try and make me feel bad about you-
713880	715400	No, I haven't!
715400	717680	I've been trying to educate you.
717680	720600	No, your education is brainwashing.
720600	721960	No, it's not!
722000	724000	You just won't listen to me!
724000	726960	No, I'm not going to listen to this crap.
726960	729520	Now you talk- I have schizophrenia!
729520	731720	I don't care what you have.
731720	733600	I don't.
733600	736000	It doesn't mean we live in squalor.
736000	738320	And it doesn't mean you're a bully.
738320	740600	You- I'm not even a bully!
740600	745200	You literally detonate me, misgender me, and tell me that like-
745200	746840	I know your mom's a boomer, sweetie.
746840	751600	She just doesn't understand that being literally neurodivergent and a minor, at least in your
751600	754800	own head, you're 20, but I mean, you're minor coded, let's say that.
754800	757320	That means you don't gotta pay rent, it's just too hard for you.
757320	758560	Capitalism's too tough, isn't it?
758560	759560	But it's okay.
759560	762760	I'm sure the creatures co-op living room hovel is just right for you.
762760	766400	You've got the look down, Pat, you've got the politics, you've got the fucking brain
766400	767400	rot.
767400	769520	Don't worry, they'll turn you into a sex worker soon enough.
769520	774360	Listen guys, I know maybe you live in a city and you see the city decaying before your
774360	778360	very eyes because you live downtown or something, you wanna get the fuck out, fair enough.
778360	781440	Or maybe you live in a small town, and maybe your small town is the one that I came from,
781440	784760	where, honestly, I hate going back there nowadays, because it's full of heroin addicts
784760	786440	and boarded up businesses.
786440	787680	There is nothing left back there.
787680	791280	You've got people on the left who are saying, get out of your small town and away from your
791280	795560	conservative parents and move into the big city and bloom and flourish and become your
795560	796560	own special snowflake.
796560	799360	And you've got people on the right who are saying, the cities are decaying, destroyed
799360	801280	by decades of leftist policies.
801280	803600	Get the fuck out of the cities and return to monkey.
803600	806800	The truth seems to be that both of them are bad in their own way, and what you like actually
806800	808000	depends on your own temperament.
808000	812800	There are absolute people who can go to a city and live a non-dysfunctional life.
812800	815420	There are absolute people who can go live in the country and not feel oppressed or too
815420	816420	far away from everything.
816420	818080	It really does depend on your temperament.
818080	822400	But right now, this worship of the idea of moving out to the city, this has got to stop
822400	823400	man.
823400	827720	Like, this is where it's creating all of this fucking insane nonsense.
827720	832440	People are literally willing to buy closets in whorehouses if it means that they can get
832440	834160	a taste of that big city living.
834160	835160	And you know what?
835160	836160	It ain't worth it, man.
836160	837160	Take it from me.
837160	838160	It ain't worth it.
838160	839160	Like, I get it.
839160	840160	You want to live close to the action.
840160	841160	Okay.
841160	842160	Understood.
842160	845040	Maybe your plan is to move to the city, grind hard, save up the money, get yourself your
845040	846040	own place.
846040	847040	Cool.
847040	848040	Great goal.
848040	849040	Owning property's good.
849040	850680	But it seems like these people forgot about the work part of that.
850680	853800	They make it to the city, and then they just sit around and subsist.
853800	857960	They rent shit holes or they turn perfectly good places into shit holes, and they completely
857960	861280	forget that this is supposed to be a transitional part of their life.
861280	863760	This is your foot in the door, not the place where you sit down.
863760	867720	And every time I hear about somebody saying, like, landlords are oppressive, we need to
867720	871840	abolish rent, whatever, then I see the people who are saying that, they're overwhelmingly
871840	872840	people like this.
872840	874520	The worst fucking tenants you could ever have.
874520	877520	Like, when these people move out, that building's going to have to be condemned, dude.
877520	878520	You know what, guys?
878520	879520	I got to go.
879520	880520	I'm going to take off.
880520	886240	I'm going to go thank my landlord for providing a decent fucking house, because this is actually
886240	890200	a pretty nice place for the price, and I'm going to be so goddamn happy that me and the
890200	893880	people who are here haven't fucking ruined it with their own filth and degeneracy.
