1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Oh, yeah, guys, I got some new audio equipment, specifically, I picked up a preamp because

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,100
you know that microphone, that one microphone that every single YouTuber uses and how it

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,480
always sounds really shit because either they'll move their mouth away and they'll basically

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,960
disappear or alternatively, they'll get too close to the microphone, they'll just peek

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
like crazy.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,180
Yeah, nobody seems to know this, but that mic really only works if you install a preamp

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,760
and I did install a preamp.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,040
So hopefully things sound a little bit better.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Yes, I know it took me two years to do it, shut up.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
But today we are talking about rentals.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,920
You know, you got to rent a house, maybe you got to rent an apartment, everyone needs a

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
place to live, right?

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,440
Well, this post went viral on Christmas Day.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,560
In fact, check out the absolute state of the rental market in New York City.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,160
Must be queer, NB or trans, person of color preferred, considerate about the space and

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,160
other people in the building, especially regarding COVID safety, willing to build space and keep

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,860
the apartment clean together, communicative, vaccinated and 24 plus preferred.

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,940
This is an anti capitalism household.

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,300
If you identify as a liberal, we won't be a good fit.

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,160
Rent is $925 plus utilities for BIPOC.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,320
That means black indigenous person of color under why you said BIPOC here, but you said

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,560
only person of color at the start $975 plus utilities for all others.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,040
All others meaning white people, obviously, unless they're counting Asians and Jews in

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
there now, which hey, given the state of the left, who knows?

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,880
Feel free to email me if you have any question, hashtag support BDS, what's BDS?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,320
Hashtag free Palestine, hashtag abolish Israel.

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,800
Yeah, they're not expecting any Jews living here.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,880
Hashtag land back, hashtag resist colonialism, hashtag global solidarity.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,720
Now when I first saw this, I was wondering, how are they getting away with this?

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Like, isn't this illegal?

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,820
Isn't it illegal to open the advertise that you won't bring in cis people or white people

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,320
into into your rental space, but it turns out these people are subletting.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,640
They've already rented the apartment, they just want somebody else to move in with them.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
And when you're subletting, that's legal because you're not a business the way that the apartment

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
owner is a business.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
So okay, fair enough.

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,720
They will hunt their anti capitalist roommate for their little hellhole in New York.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Okay.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
I understand.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
I gotta ask here.

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,840
What is willing to build space mean like the sentence here?

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
Willing to build space and keep the apartment clean together.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
We'll keep the apartment clean.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,020
Okay, that's normal.

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,260
But willing to build space.

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
What do you what are you fucking doing?

47
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,320
Are you knocking down a wall and like colonizing somebody else's apartment?

48
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,040
That doesn't that doesn't sound very progressive of you.

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Or maybe you're like opening the windows up and building a new room out off the side of

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
the building.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,400
If you're building space that what the fuck do you mean build space?

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,020
This just honestly sounds like some hippie dippie bullshit.

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,280
It sounds like the stuff that I would hear when I was taking like intro to critical theory

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
during my second year of university.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,720
And see, they say you must be queer and be your trans and POC preferred.

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,440
So they will take a white person if they have to, but they're not gonna take a cis person.

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,120
So imagine being a white trans woman.

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,760
You know, you're down on your luck, you're looking for a place, you come across this,

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,880
this listing, and they're like, you know what that white privilege, you got to pay $50 more

60
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,720
Geez, it just it sounds so ridiculous.

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,520
These people are legitimately bigoted.

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,480
And you know what, I'm not even dogging on people who want some kind of rental with people

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,280
who are like them, whether that be racial, whether that be sexual, whether that be gender

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
specific, like, fine, you like what you like, like here, check this out.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,000
This seems to be a reasonable way to put this looking to rent or lease with a queer friendly

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
roommate.

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,480
Hey, I'm looking around for roommates who are queer friendly and cat friendly.

68
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,960
I would have one cat who is very shy and would be paying rent through my substituting job.

69
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
My phone number is available.

70
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
My service is bad.

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Okay.

72
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
But still, like, look at this.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
It's just it's just a normal thing.

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
It's like, listen, I'm queer.

75
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,200
I don't know if that means that if they're gay or if they're bi or if they're trans or

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,520
there's something there and they're like, I need somebody who will accommodate me.

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Fair enough.

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,260
There's none of this crazy fucking nonsense.

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,840
It's just hey, this is what I need.

80
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Okay.

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
And you know what?

82
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
You find somebody who will fit you.

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Great.

84
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
But yeah.

85
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Well, then you guys keep looking.

86
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
That's okay.

87
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
That is.

88
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
This is the beauty of the free market.

89
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,400
Letting people state their preferences and then try to find those who match with them

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
willingly.

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,360
Here's the hellish version of this very same thing.

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,720
Nine hundred dollars and a three bedroom queer creative house with a backyard.

93
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
Cutie BIPOC prioritize and encourage.

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
What does this mean?

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
OK.

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
BIPOC.

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
We got that before.

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Do you mean like cutie as you find them attractive?

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,360
Like maybe it's maybe it's queer trans.

100
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,280
You need like a fucking decryption key to figure this stuff out.

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,000
Hey, folks, we've got one bedroom available in our sunny Oakland community care centered

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
house.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,760
It's off High Street, East Lake, huge grassy backyard.

104
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,840
As you read this, you realize it just sounds like a regular house, you know, and then you

105
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,680
get down to about us.

106
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,760
See they them queer and be white, 28 community minded and lover of honest, compassionate

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
communication.

108
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,400
In other words, that sounds like somebody who will just shit on you and say, oh, I'm

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,520
just being honest.

110
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm just brutally honest.

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
That's how I am.

112
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,040
Darling works from home.

113
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,720
Making digital content for labor organizing and working on alternatives to the police.

114
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,120
OK, so if they're getting paid, they run an account like Rose City Antifa.

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,580
They're social, sensitive and passionate and come alive when skating, letting their freak

116
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,640
flag fly on the dance floor, floating in the water, making magic and community and in deep

117
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,120
convos about liberation.

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Can you imagine like you come home from work?

119
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
You just want to fucking go to your room.

120
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,400
Maybe, you know, play some video games, eat some food, watch whatever the fuck.

121
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,600
And you got this person knock on your door.

122
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Excuse me.

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,720
It's time for our Marxist talk and liberation.

124
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,400
Can you please come out into the kitchen?

125
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
It's like fuck off.

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I want to sleep.

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,880
E is they them queer plus non-binary and trans, white 31 spends most of their time organizing

128
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,360
to break up corporate power and help create new food systems.

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,480
I guarantee you the only food system this person cares about is the one that starts

130
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,380
at their mouth and ends at their asshole.

131
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,380
Break up corporate.

132
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,680
You guys don't know how to fucking farm.

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
You live in a big city.

134
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,320
It's gonna be like Chaz all over again.

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,400
Remember those sad little plants they had going?

136
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
They can't feed the city block on that shit.

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,640
They like drawing, practicing magic with friends or are they Wiccan, I guess?

138
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
They're vegan.

139
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
They're learning to tattoo.

140
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
They work from home and they like to skate.

141
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,520
They like to socialize, especially through art and dance, but also likes quiet time alone

142
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
to recharge.

143
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,260
Oh God, both of these people work from home.

144
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,160
This sounds almost intolerable.

145
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
And then finally there's B, a sweet magical kitten whose eyes hold secrets to the universe.

146
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,100
Assuming that's actually a cat like a pet and not just, you know, a woman who calls

147
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,300
herself kitten.

148
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,080
That might be the most acceptable person there.

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,960
It's important to all of us that we are actively working to decolonize our minds and create

150
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,700
a world where liberation is possible for all people.

151
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,260
Black trans lives matter.

152
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,820
If you don't agree, we aren't a good fit.

153
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,100
Listen, you want to be liberated?

154
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,360
Don't live in a house like this.

155
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,480
One room is available in an LGBT POC friendly shared home.

156
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,940
There's already three roommates there.

157
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,540
One is S in her forties.

158
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,100
She and they, she's an award-winning performer and yoga instructor.

159
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,300
Jesus, what, what performance are you given that you're also a yoga instructor on the

160
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
bed?

161
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,860
Do you teach the best yoga class in town or something B forties?

162
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,780
He him works in education with limited exposure to the public, enjoys cooking, tabletop gaming,

163
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
theater and music.

164
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Oh God.

165
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
Imagine joining this guy's tabletop game.

166
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,860
You have to sign one of those tabletop consent forms.

167
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,420
Maybe you got to hear about how orcs are black coded and therefore racist.

168
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
D forties.

169
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,300
He him works in tech with limited exposure to coworkers and these guys are all in their

170
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
forties.

171
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,140
Like, fuck, imagine having a roommate even, even then, and like not living with your girl

172
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
or something.

173
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,860
That doesn't sound kind of critical because currently in my house, we've got me, we've

174
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,260
got Naomi, my girlfriend, and we've got Dave, my friends.

175
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,820
So he, he is the third wheel.

176
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,820
He's the roommate.

177
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,460
But the difference is I've known Dave since I was four years old.

178
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,340
I would, at my age, I would not be tolerating just having randoms move into my place.

179
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
Fuck.

180
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,000
No, I'm not 19 anymore.

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,460
We are looking for someone who is serious about practicing COVID safety, LGBT queer

182
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,580
and POC encouraged to apply.

183
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,420
We are friendly hermits who love our cats and chickens in the back yard.

184
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,860
You guys, you guys are raising chickens back there.

185
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,940
Fucking imagine after like a hard week at work, you come home, you just want to hang

186
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,500
out, maybe sit out in the back porch with a coffee on Saturday morning, try to have

187
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,980
just like a little bit of peace.

188
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,460
And then suddenly a whole bunch of chickens come up and start pecking your fucking feet.

189
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Check out this rental.

190
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
This one's from Portland.

191
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,500
We are anti-cop, anti-authoritarian and lean towards a collective structure.

192
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,420
The house is currently half BIPOC.

193
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,460
An understanding of structural white supremacy is necessary.

194
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,660
House is somethings and mostly queer and trans like to craft, cook and bake, maintain relationships

195
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
with one another.

196
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,220
Read, do political projects, have bonfires in the back yard and garden, witchy, kink

197
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,980
and sex worker positive.

198
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,820
Add green in the subject heading to ensure the entire ad was read.

199
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,340
You got to give these guys a secret code for they'll let you in.

200
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,900
We are looking for housemates that are able to communicate directly, listen and respect

201
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,280
to those boundaries and needs.

202
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,420
We have monthly meetings and have discussions about COVID risk.

203
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
Okay.

204
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,560
I was joking about the Marxist meetings earlier.

205
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,940
That was a gag on my part, but all these people were like, it's time for you to come to the

206
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,500
monthly meeting, dear.

207
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

208
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
God damn it.

209
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Karen.

210
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
I just pulled, came off a night shift with me.

211
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,860
If I can see no monthly COVID meeting, they have their meetings about COVID consent and

212
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
harm reduction.

213
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Oh God.

214
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
A monthly meetings about consent.

215
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,020
Um, excuse me.

216
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,620
So I saw that you brought a girl to the house last week or did you make sure that you obtained

217
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,620
her consent?

218
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,580
We were listening in through the door and we didn't hear her explicitly.

219
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Give consent.

220
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,760
Did she sign a consent form?

221
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,980
This sounds like it would be fucking hell to live in.

222
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,700
You know what lean towards a collective structure means.

223
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,020
That means that your room isn't actually your room.

224
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,940
You want some private space where it's you in exclusivity who owns the location.

225
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,940
No, man.

226
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,220
It's all collectively owned.

227
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,060
This ad reads like you're paying for the privilege of having a fucking commissar run your life.

228
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,500
The most famous version of this sort of thing happening was back in May of 2021 when this

229
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,500
ad rental for a Portland Antifa whorehouse went viral on Twitter.

230
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,320
Rent is three Oh two per month and eight by eight, that's a very big eight by eight.

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay with noise.

232
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,100
You're located off of the living room and by the front door, so you will hear a lot

233
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
of traffic.

234
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,460
The walls don't extend all the way to the ceiling, so you'll hear a lot of stuff.

235
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
Jesus.

236
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,980
You have to be okay with sex workers.

237
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,480
We have three in our house and frequently have loud sex.

238
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,420
You couldn't pay me three Oh two to take this fucking room.

239
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Holy shit.

240
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,060
Here's a picture of the room and oh my God, look at this.

241
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,400
They literally took a section of their living room.

242
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,820
They put up folding doors.

243
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,540
You know the doors that kind of accordion themselves closed and open on some on some

244
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,540
closets.

245
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,300
They just stuck those up and then they put a curtain and there's your fucking room for

246
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,580
three hundred and two dollars a month.

247
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,020
You can live in a literal hole in the wall.

248
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,820
Here's what the rest of the rental ad read.

249
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,500
You have to be a cab.

250
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,760
All cops are bastards.

251
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Don't be ableist.

252
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,340
Don't be racist or homophobic, transphobic or a misogynist and then it talks about the

253
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,260
sex worker stuff and then whoever moves in must also have little to no belongings and

254
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,720
be okay with the home being used to host homeless people on the couch.

255
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,580
So let me get this straight for you to pay for your tiny slice of this house literally

256
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,120
carved out for you.

257
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,160
You got to pay three hundred and two dollars for that.

258
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,160
But the bum down the street who's shooting up heroin, he can come in and sleep on the

259
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
couch.

260
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
No problem.

261
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Scott free.

262
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I can't fucking believe this dude.

263
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,400
The location is called the Creatures Co-op and Creatures Co-op is run by Brandy Jo Taylor

264
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Fish.

265
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,320
She seems to spend her time fundraising for Antifa specifically to get enough money to

266
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,840
bail out people who were charged during riots.

267
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,320
Fish's partner, Ribbity Raggedy, yes, that's her name, is one of the sex workers living

268
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
at the house.

269
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,200
By golly, wouldn't you want to spend your evenings with nothing but a curtain between

270
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,840
you and the outside listening to these people have sex all night long?

271
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,000
Well fuck, just sign me up there.

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
Just fuck my entire life up, dude.

273
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,280
This video here went viral around the same time of a 20 year old full blown narcissism

274
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,040
project getting kicked out of her place by her parents who just don't understand what

275
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,880
it's like to be a young person nowadays.

276
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,040
You legally have to give me a month.

277
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,240
No, I don't because you haven't paid one brown penny.

278
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm not obligated to and I can't afford to.

279
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Guess what?

280
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
It doesn't matter.

281
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,280
You can't just tell me I have two weeks to find somewhere.

282
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,200
You've had over a month and- No, I haven't!

283
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,880
Look, you have done nothing but dig your heels in and try and make me feel bad about you-

284
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,400
No, I haven't!

285
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,680
I've been trying to educate you.

286
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,600
No, your education is brainwashing.

287
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,960
No, it's not!

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You just won't listen to me!

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,960
No, I'm not going to listen to this crap.

290
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,520
Now you talk- I have schizophrenia!

291
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,720
I don't care what you have.

292
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,600
I don't.

293
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
It doesn't mean we live in squalor.

294
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
And it doesn't mean you're a bully.

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,600
You- I'm not even a bully!

296
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,200
You literally detonate me, misgender me, and tell me that like-

297
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,840
I know your mom's a boomer, sweetie.

298
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,600
She just doesn't understand that being literally neurodivergent and a minor, at least in your

299
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,800
own head, you're 20, but I mean, you're minor coded, let's say that.

300
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,320
That means you don't gotta pay rent, it's just too hard for you.

301
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,560
Capitalism's too tough, isn't it?

302
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
But it's okay.

303
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm sure the creatures co-op living room hovel is just right for you.

304
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,400
You've got the look down, Pat, you've got the politics, you've got the fucking brain

305
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
rot.

306
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,520
Don't worry, they'll turn you into a sex worker soon enough.

307
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,360
Listen guys, I know maybe you live in a city and you see the city decaying before your

308
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,360
very eyes because you live downtown or something, you wanna get the fuck out, fair enough.

309
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,440
Or maybe you live in a small town, and maybe your small town is the one that I came from,

310
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,760
where, honestly, I hate going back there nowadays, because it's full of heroin addicts

311
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,440
and boarded up businesses.

312
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,680
There is nothing left back there.

313
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,280
You've got people on the left who are saying, get out of your small town and away from your

314
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,560
conservative parents and move into the big city and bloom and flourish and become your

315
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
own special snowflake.

316
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,360
And you've got people on the right who are saying, the cities are decaying, destroyed

317
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,280
by decades of leftist policies.

318
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,600
Get the fuck out of the cities and return to monkey.

319
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
The truth seems to be that both of them are bad in their own way, and what you like actually

320
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
depends on your own temperament.

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,800
There are absolute people who can go to a city and live a non-dysfunctional life.

322
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,420
There are absolute people who can go live in the country and not feel oppressed or too

323
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
far away from everything.

324
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,080
It really does depend on your temperament.

325
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,400
But right now, this worship of the idea of moving out to the city, this has got to stop

326
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
man.

327
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,720
Like, this is where it's creating all of this fucking insane nonsense.

328
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,440
People are literally willing to buy closets in whorehouses if it means that they can get

329
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,160
a taste of that big city living.

330
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
And you know what?

331
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
It ain't worth it, man.

332
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Take it from me.

333
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
It ain't worth it.

334
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
Like, I get it.

335
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
You want to live close to the action.

336
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Okay.

337
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Understood.

338
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,040
Maybe your plan is to move to the city, grind hard, save up the money, get yourself your

339
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
own place.

340
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Cool.

341
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Great goal.

342
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Owning property's good.

343
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,680
But it seems like these people forgot about the work part of that.

344
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,800
They make it to the city, and then they just sit around and subsist.

345
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,960
They rent shit holes or they turn perfectly good places into shit holes, and they completely

346
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,280
forget that this is supposed to be a transitional part of their life.

347
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,760
This is your foot in the door, not the place where you sit down.

348
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,720
And every time I hear about somebody saying, like, landlords are oppressive, we need to

349
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,840
abolish rent, whatever, then I see the people who are saying that, they're overwhelmingly

350
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
people like this.

351
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,520
The worst fucking tenants you could ever have.

352
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Like, when these people move out, that building's going to have to be condemned, dude.

353
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
You know what, guys?

354
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I got to go.

355
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm going to take off.

356
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,240
I'm going to go thank my landlord for providing a decent fucking house, because this is actually

357
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,200
a pretty nice place for the price, and I'm going to be so goddamn happy that me and the

358
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,880
people who are here haven't fucking ruined it with their own filth and degeneracy.
