WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
Oh, yeah, guys, I got some new audio equipment, specifically, I picked up a preamp because

00:09.680 --> 00:14.100
you know that microphone, that one microphone that every single YouTuber uses and how it

00:14.100 --> 00:18.480
always sounds really shit because either they'll move their mouth away and they'll basically

00:18.480 --> 00:21.960
disappear or alternatively, they'll get too close to the microphone, they'll just peek

00:21.960 --> 00:22.960
like crazy.

00:22.960 --> 00:27.180
Yeah, nobody seems to know this, but that mic really only works if you install a preamp

00:27.180 --> 00:28.760
and I did install a preamp.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.040
So hopefully things sound a little bit better.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.040
Yes, I know it took me two years to do it, shut up.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.040
But today we are talking about rentals.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.920
You know, you got to rent a house, maybe you got to rent an apartment, everyone needs a

00:36.920 --> 00:37.920
place to live, right?

00:37.920 --> 00:40.440
Well, this post went viral on Christmas Day.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.560
In fact, check out the absolute state of the rental market in New York City.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.160
Must be queer, NB or trans, person of color preferred, considerate about the space and

00:50.160 --> 00:55.160
other people in the building, especially regarding COVID safety, willing to build space and keep

00:55.160 --> 00:59.860
the apartment clean together, communicative, vaccinated and 24 plus preferred.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.940
This is an anti capitalism household.

01:01.940 --> 01:04.300
If you identify as a liberal, we won't be a good fit.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.160
Rent is $925 plus utilities for BIPOC.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.320
That means black indigenous person of color under why you said BIPOC here, but you said

01:12.320 --> 01:17.560
only person of color at the start $975 plus utilities for all others.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.040
All others meaning white people, obviously, unless they're counting Asians and Jews in

01:21.040 --> 01:23.840
there now, which hey, given the state of the left, who knows?

01:23.840 --> 01:28.880
Feel free to email me if you have any question, hashtag support BDS, what's BDS?

01:28.880 --> 01:31.320
Hashtag free Palestine, hashtag abolish Israel.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.800
Yeah, they're not expecting any Jews living here.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.880
Hashtag land back, hashtag resist colonialism, hashtag global solidarity.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.720
Now when I first saw this, I was wondering, how are they getting away with this?

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
Like, isn't this illegal?

01:41.720 --> 01:46.820
Isn't it illegal to open the advertise that you won't bring in cis people or white people

01:46.820 --> 01:50.320
into into your rental space, but it turns out these people are subletting.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.640
They've already rented the apartment, they just want somebody else to move in with them.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.920
And when you're subletting, that's legal because you're not a business the way that the apartment

01:57.920 --> 01:58.920
owner is a business.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
So okay, fair enough.

01:59.920 --> 02:04.720
They will hunt their anti capitalist roommate for their little hellhole in New York.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
Okay.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
I understand.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.720
I gotta ask here.

02:07.720 --> 02:11.840
What is willing to build space mean like the sentence here?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.920
Willing to build space and keep the apartment clean together.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
We'll keep the apartment clean.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.020
Okay, that's normal.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.260
But willing to build space.

02:18.260 --> 02:19.260
What do you what are you fucking doing?

02:19.260 --> 02:22.320
Are you knocking down a wall and like colonizing somebody else's apartment?

02:22.320 --> 02:24.040
That doesn't that doesn't sound very progressive of you.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.880
Or maybe you're like opening the windows up and building a new room out off the side of

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
the building.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.400
If you're building space that what the fuck do you mean build space?

02:32.400 --> 02:35.020
This just honestly sounds like some hippie dippie bullshit.

02:35.020 --> 02:39.280
It sounds like the stuff that I would hear when I was taking like intro to critical theory

02:39.280 --> 02:41.000
during my second year of university.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.720
And see, they say you must be queer and be your trans and POC preferred.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.440
So they will take a white person if they have to, but they're not gonna take a cis person.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.120
So imagine being a white trans woman.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.760
You know, you're down on your luck, you're looking for a place, you come across this,

02:53.760 --> 02:57.880
this listing, and they're like, you know what that white privilege, you got to pay $50 more

02:57.880 --> 03:00.720
Geez, it just it sounds so ridiculous.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.520
These people are legitimately bigoted.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.480
And you know what, I'm not even dogging on people who want some kind of rental with people

03:07.480 --> 03:11.280
who are like them, whether that be racial, whether that be sexual, whether that be gender

03:11.280 --> 03:15.200
specific, like, fine, you like what you like, like here, check this out.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.000
This seems to be a reasonable way to put this looking to rent or lease with a queer friendly

03:20.040 --> 03:21.040
roommate.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.480
Hey, I'm looking around for roommates who are queer friendly and cat friendly.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.960
I would have one cat who is very shy and would be paying rent through my substituting job.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
My phone number is available.

03:28.960 --> 03:29.960
My service is bad.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.960
Okay.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
But still, like, look at this.

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
It's just it's just a normal thing.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
It's like, listen, I'm queer.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.200
I don't know if that means that if they're gay or if they're bi or if they're trans or

03:36.200 --> 03:39.520
there's something there and they're like, I need somebody who will accommodate me.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
Fair enough.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.260
There's none of this crazy fucking nonsense.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.840
It's just hey, this is what I need.

03:44.840 --> 03:45.840
Okay.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.840
And you know what?

03:46.840 --> 03:47.840
You find somebody who will fit you.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.840
Great.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.880
But yeah.

03:49.880 --> 03:50.880
Well, then you guys keep looking.

03:50.880 --> 03:51.880
That's okay.

03:51.880 --> 03:52.880
That is.

03:52.880 --> 03:53.880
This is the beauty of the free market.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.400
Letting people state their preferences and then try to find those who match with them

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
willingly.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.360
Here's the hellish version of this very same thing.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.720
Nine hundred dollars and a three bedroom queer creative house with a backyard.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.120
Cutie BIPOC prioritize and encourage.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.120
What does this mean?

04:09.120 --> 04:10.120
OK.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.120
BIPOC.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.120
We got that before.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.640
Do you mean like cutie as you find them attractive?

04:14.640 --> 04:16.360
Like maybe it's maybe it's queer trans.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.280
You need like a fucking decryption key to figure this stuff out.

04:19.280 --> 04:23.000
Hey, folks, we've got one bedroom available in our sunny Oakland community care centered

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
house.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.760
It's off High Street, East Lake, huge grassy backyard.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.840
As you read this, you realize it just sounds like a regular house, you know, and then you

04:28.840 --> 04:30.680
get down to about us.

04:30.680 --> 04:36.760
See they them queer and be white, 28 community minded and lover of honest, compassionate

04:36.760 --> 04:37.760
communication.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.400
In other words, that sounds like somebody who will just shit on you and say, oh, I'm

04:41.400 --> 04:42.520
just being honest.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.520
I'm just brutally honest.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.520
That's how I am.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.040
Darling works from home.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.720
Making digital content for labor organizing and working on alternatives to the police.

04:49.720 --> 04:54.120
OK, so if they're getting paid, they run an account like Rose City Antifa.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.580
They're social, sensitive and passionate and come alive when skating, letting their freak

04:58.580 --> 05:03.640
flag fly on the dance floor, floating in the water, making magic and community and in deep

05:03.640 --> 05:05.120
convos about liberation.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.920
Can you imagine like you come home from work?

05:06.920 --> 05:08.680
You just want to fucking go to your room.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.400
Maybe, you know, play some video games, eat some food, watch whatever the fuck.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.600
And you got this person knock on your door.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
Excuse me.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.720
It's time for our Marxist talk and liberation.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.400
Can you please come out into the kitchen?

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
It's like fuck off.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.400
I want to sleep.

05:21.400 --> 05:27.880
E is they them queer plus non-binary and trans, white 31 spends most of their time organizing

05:27.880 --> 05:31.360
to break up corporate power and help create new food systems.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.480
I guarantee you the only food system this person cares about is the one that starts

05:35.480 --> 05:37.380
at their mouth and ends at their asshole.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.380
Break up corporate.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.680
You guys don't know how to fucking farm.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.680
You live in a big city.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.320
It's gonna be like Chaz all over again.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.400
Remember those sad little plants they had going?

05:44.400 --> 05:46.240
They can't feed the city block on that shit.

05:46.240 --> 05:51.640
They like drawing, practicing magic with friends or are they Wiccan, I guess?

05:51.640 --> 05:52.640
They're vegan.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.640
They're learning to tattoo.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.640
They work from home and they like to skate.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.520
They like to socialize, especially through art and dance, but also likes quiet time alone

05:58.520 --> 05:59.520
to recharge.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.260
Oh God, both of these people work from home.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.160
This sounds almost intolerable.

06:04.160 --> 06:08.720
And then finally there's B, a sweet magical kitten whose eyes hold secrets to the universe.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.100
Assuming that's actually a cat like a pet and not just, you know, a woman who calls

06:13.100 --> 06:14.300
herself kitten.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.080
That might be the most acceptable person there.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.960
It's important to all of us that we are actively working to decolonize our minds and create

06:19.960 --> 06:22.700
a world where liberation is possible for all people.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.260
Black trans lives matter.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.820
If you don't agree, we aren't a good fit.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.100
Listen, you want to be liberated?

06:27.100 --> 06:28.360
Don't live in a house like this.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.480
One room is available in an LGBT POC friendly shared home.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.940
There's already three roommates there.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.540
One is S in her forties.

06:35.540 --> 06:39.100
She and they, she's an award-winning performer and yoga instructor.

06:39.100 --> 06:43.300
Jesus, what, what performance are you given that you're also a yoga instructor on the

06:43.300 --> 06:44.300
bed?

06:44.300 --> 06:46.860
Do you teach the best yoga class in town or something B forties?

06:46.860 --> 06:50.780
He him works in education with limited exposure to the public, enjoys cooking, tabletop gaming,

06:50.780 --> 06:51.780
theater and music.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.780
Oh God.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.780
Imagine joining this guy's tabletop game.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.860
You have to sign one of those tabletop consent forms.

06:56.860 --> 07:00.420
Maybe you got to hear about how orcs are black coded and therefore racist.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.420
D forties.

07:01.420 --> 07:05.300
He him works in tech with limited exposure to coworkers and these guys are all in their

07:05.300 --> 07:06.300
forties.

07:06.300 --> 07:10.140
Like, fuck, imagine having a roommate even, even then, and like not living with your girl

07:10.140 --> 07:11.140
or something.

07:11.140 --> 07:14.860
That doesn't sound kind of critical because currently in my house, we've got me, we've

07:14.860 --> 07:17.260
got Naomi, my girlfriend, and we've got Dave, my friends.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.820
So he, he is the third wheel.

07:18.820 --> 07:19.820
He's the roommate.

07:19.820 --> 07:22.460
But the difference is I've known Dave since I was four years old.

07:22.460 --> 07:27.340
I would, at my age, I would not be tolerating just having randoms move into my place.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.340
Fuck.

07:28.340 --> 07:30.000
No, I'm not 19 anymore.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.460
We are looking for someone who is serious about practicing COVID safety, LGBT queer

07:34.460 --> 07:36.580
and POC encouraged to apply.

07:36.580 --> 07:40.420
We are friendly hermits who love our cats and chickens in the back yard.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.860
You guys, you guys are raising chickens back there.

07:42.860 --> 07:45.940
Fucking imagine after like a hard week at work, you come home, you just want to hang

07:45.940 --> 07:49.500
out, maybe sit out in the back porch with a coffee on Saturday morning, try to have

07:49.500 --> 07:50.980
just like a little bit of peace.

07:50.980 --> 07:53.460
And then suddenly a whole bunch of chickens come up and start pecking your fucking feet.

07:53.460 --> 07:54.460
Check out this rental.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.460
This one's from Portland.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.500
We are anti-cop, anti-authoritarian and lean towards a collective structure.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.420
The house is currently half BIPOC.

08:00.420 --> 08:03.460
An understanding of structural white supremacy is necessary.

08:03.460 --> 08:08.660
House is somethings and mostly queer and trans like to craft, cook and bake, maintain relationships

08:08.660 --> 08:09.660
with one another.

08:09.660 --> 08:14.220
Read, do political projects, have bonfires in the back yard and garden, witchy, kink

08:14.220 --> 08:15.980
and sex worker positive.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.820
Add green in the subject heading to ensure the entire ad was read.

08:18.820 --> 08:21.340
You got to give these guys a secret code for they'll let you in.

08:21.340 --> 08:24.900
We are looking for housemates that are able to communicate directly, listen and respect

08:24.900 --> 08:26.280
to those boundaries and needs.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.420
We have monthly meetings and have discussions about COVID risk.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.420
Okay.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.560
I was joking about the Marxist meetings earlier.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.940
That was a gag on my part, but all these people were like, it's time for you to come to the

08:35.940 --> 08:37.500
monthly meeting, dear.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
God damn it.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
Karen.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
I just pulled, came off a night shift with me.

08:41.500 --> 08:45.860
If I can see no monthly COVID meeting, they have their meetings about COVID consent and

08:45.860 --> 08:46.860
harm reduction.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.860
Oh God.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.860
A monthly meetings about consent.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.020
Um, excuse me.

08:50.020 --> 08:54.620
So I saw that you brought a girl to the house last week or did you make sure that you obtained

08:54.620 --> 08:55.620
her consent?

08:55.620 --> 08:58.580
We were listening in through the door and we didn't hear her explicitly.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.580
Give consent.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.760
Did she sign a consent form?

09:00.760 --> 09:02.980
This sounds like it would be fucking hell to live in.

09:02.980 --> 09:05.700
You know what lean towards a collective structure means.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.020
That means that your room isn't actually your room.

09:08.540 --> 09:11.940
You want some private space where it's you in exclusivity who owns the location.

09:11.940 --> 09:12.940
No, man.

09:12.940 --> 09:14.220
It's all collectively owned.

09:14.220 --> 09:18.060
This ad reads like you're paying for the privilege of having a fucking commissar run your life.

09:18.060 --> 09:23.500
The most famous version of this sort of thing happening was back in May of 2021 when this

09:23.500 --> 09:28.500
ad rental for a Portland Antifa whorehouse went viral on Twitter.

09:28.500 --> 09:32.320
Rent is three Oh two per month and eight by eight, that's a very big eight by eight.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.320
Okay with noise.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.100
You're located off of the living room and by the front door, so you will hear a lot

09:36.100 --> 09:37.100
of traffic.

09:37.180 --> 09:40.460
The walls don't extend all the way to the ceiling, so you'll hear a lot of stuff.

09:40.460 --> 09:41.460
Jesus.

09:41.460 --> 09:42.980
You have to be okay with sex workers.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.480
We have three in our house and frequently have loud sex.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.420
You couldn't pay me three Oh two to take this fucking room.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.420
Holy shit.

09:50.420 --> 09:53.060
Here's a picture of the room and oh my God, look at this.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.400
They literally took a section of their living room.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.820
They put up folding doors.

09:56.820 --> 10:00.540
You know the doors that kind of accordion themselves closed and open on some on some

10:00.540 --> 10:01.540
closets.

10:01.540 --> 10:05.300
They just stuck those up and then they put a curtain and there's your fucking room for

10:05.300 --> 10:07.580
three hundred and two dollars a month.

10:07.580 --> 10:10.020
You can live in a literal hole in the wall.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.820
Here's what the rest of the rental ad read.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.500
You have to be a cab.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.760
All cops are bastards.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.760
Don't be ableist.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.340
Don't be racist or homophobic, transphobic or a misogynist and then it talks about the

10:19.340 --> 10:24.260
sex worker stuff and then whoever moves in must also have little to no belongings and

10:24.260 --> 10:29.720
be okay with the home being used to host homeless people on the couch.

10:29.720 --> 10:33.580
So let me get this straight for you to pay for your tiny slice of this house literally

10:33.580 --> 10:35.120
carved out for you.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.160
You got to pay three hundred and two dollars for that.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.160
But the bum down the street who's shooting up heroin, he can come in and sleep on the

10:40.160 --> 10:41.160
couch.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.160
No problem.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.160
Scott free.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.160
I can't fucking believe this dude.

10:44.160 --> 10:49.400
The location is called the Creatures Co-op and Creatures Co-op is run by Brandy Jo Taylor

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
Fish.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.320
She seems to spend her time fundraising for Antifa specifically to get enough money to

10:54.320 --> 10:56.840
bail out people who were charged during riots.

10:56.840 --> 11:01.320
Fish's partner, Ribbity Raggedy, yes, that's her name, is one of the sex workers living

11:01.320 --> 11:02.320
at the house.

11:02.320 --> 11:06.200
By golly, wouldn't you want to spend your evenings with nothing but a curtain between

11:06.200 --> 11:09.840
you and the outside listening to these people have sex all night long?

11:09.840 --> 11:12.000
Well fuck, just sign me up there.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.160
Just fuck my entire life up, dude.

11:14.160 --> 11:19.280
This video here went viral around the same time of a 20 year old full blown narcissism

11:19.280 --> 11:24.040
project getting kicked out of her place by her parents who just don't understand what

11:24.040 --> 11:25.880
it's like to be a young person nowadays.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.040
You legally have to give me a month.

11:28.040 --> 11:32.240
No, I don't because you haven't paid one brown penny.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.400
I'm not obligated to and I can't afford to.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
Guess what?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
It doesn't matter.

11:39.400 --> 11:44.280
You can't just tell me I have two weeks to find somewhere.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.200
You've had over a month and- No, I haven't!

11:48.200 --> 11:53.880
Look, you have done nothing but dig your heels in and try and make me feel bad about you-

11:53.880 --> 11:55.400
No, I haven't!

11:55.400 --> 11:57.680
I've been trying to educate you.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.600
No, your education is brainwashing.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.960
No, it's not!

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
You just won't listen to me!

12:04.000 --> 12:06.960
No, I'm not going to listen to this crap.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.520
Now you talk- I have schizophrenia!

12:09.520 --> 12:11.720
I don't care what you have.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.600
I don't.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.000
It doesn't mean we live in squalor.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.320
And it doesn't mean you're a bully.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.600
You- I'm not even a bully!

12:20.600 --> 12:25.200
You literally detonate me, misgender me, and tell me that like-

12:25.200 --> 12:26.840
I know your mom's a boomer, sweetie.

12:26.840 --> 12:31.600
She just doesn't understand that being literally neurodivergent and a minor, at least in your

12:31.600 --> 12:34.800
own head, you're 20, but I mean, you're minor coded, let's say that.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.320
That means you don't gotta pay rent, it's just too hard for you.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.560
Capitalism's too tough, isn't it?

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
But it's okay.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.760
I'm sure the creatures co-op living room hovel is just right for you.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.400
You've got the look down, Pat, you've got the politics, you've got the fucking brain

12:46.400 --> 12:47.400
rot.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.520
Don't worry, they'll turn you into a sex worker soon enough.

12:49.520 --> 12:54.360
Listen guys, I know maybe you live in a city and you see the city decaying before your

12:54.360 --> 12:58.360
very eyes because you live downtown or something, you wanna get the fuck out, fair enough.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.440
Or maybe you live in a small town, and maybe your small town is the one that I came from,

13:01.440 --> 13:04.760
where, honestly, I hate going back there nowadays, because it's full of heroin addicts

13:04.760 --> 13:06.440
and boarded up businesses.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.680
There is nothing left back there.

13:07.680 --> 13:11.280
You've got people on the left who are saying, get out of your small town and away from your

13:11.280 --> 13:15.560
conservative parents and move into the big city and bloom and flourish and become your

13:15.560 --> 13:16.560
own special snowflake.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.360
And you've got people on the right who are saying, the cities are decaying, destroyed

13:19.360 --> 13:21.280
by decades of leftist policies.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.600
Get the fuck out of the cities and return to monkey.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.800
The truth seems to be that both of them are bad in their own way, and what you like actually

13:26.800 --> 13:28.000
depends on your own temperament.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.800
There are absolute people who can go to a city and live a non-dysfunctional life.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.420
There are absolute people who can go live in the country and not feel oppressed or too

13:35.420 --> 13:36.420
far away from everything.

13:36.420 --> 13:38.080
It really does depend on your temperament.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.400
But right now, this worship of the idea of moving out to the city, this has got to stop

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
man.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.720
Like, this is where it's creating all of this fucking insane nonsense.

13:47.720 --> 13:52.440
People are literally willing to buy closets in whorehouses if it means that they can get

13:52.440 --> 13:54.160
a taste of that big city living.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.160
And you know what?

13:55.160 --> 13:56.160
It ain't worth it, man.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.160
Take it from me.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.160
It ain't worth it.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
Like, I get it.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.160
You want to live close to the action.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.160
Okay.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.160
Understood.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.040
Maybe your plan is to move to the city, grind hard, save up the money, get yourself your

14:05.040 --> 14:06.040
own place.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
Cool.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
Great goal.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.040
Owning property's good.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.680
But it seems like these people forgot about the work part of that.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.800
They make it to the city, and then they just sit around and subsist.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.960
They rent shit holes or they turn perfectly good places into shit holes, and they completely

14:17.960 --> 14:21.280
forget that this is supposed to be a transitional part of their life.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.760
This is your foot in the door, not the place where you sit down.

14:23.760 --> 14:27.720
And every time I hear about somebody saying, like, landlords are oppressive, we need to

14:27.720 --> 14:31.840
abolish rent, whatever, then I see the people who are saying that, they're overwhelmingly

14:31.840 --> 14:32.840
people like this.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.520
The worst fucking tenants you could ever have.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.520
Like, when these people move out, that building's going to have to be condemned, dude.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.520
You know what, guys?

14:38.520 --> 14:39.520
I got to go.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.520
I'm going to take off.

14:40.520 --> 14:46.240
I'm going to go thank my landlord for providing a decent fucking house, because this is actually

14:46.240 --> 14:50.200
a pretty nice place for the price, and I'm going to be so goddamn happy that me and the

14:50.200 --> 14:53.880
people who are here haven't fucking ruined it with their own filth and degeneracy.
