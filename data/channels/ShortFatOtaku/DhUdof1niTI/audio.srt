1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Merry Christmas everyone! I'm recording this on Christmas Day! But you're getting it on Boxing Day,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,000
December 26th, which is still technically within the Christmas season. Though I've heard Americans

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,360
don't actually celebrate Boxing Day, so TLDR, if you're in an English-speaking country that isn't

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,840
America, the UK, Canada, Australia, etc., we all celebrate Boxing Day. And it's part of the

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,440
Christmas lineup for us. So even though this is coming out on Tuesday, it's still the season,

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,000
at least for me. I hope you've all enjoyed your Christmas, and let's take a look at some

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,760
Christmas TikToks. Here we go.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,720
I wonder what's wrong with the car. Oh no, RIP. I wonder if that's like a mode you can set up in

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,920
your car, or if that car is actually just borked. Also, I just noticed VLC, which is what I use to

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,120
watch all the TikToks I've accumulated. It has a little Christmas thing going on today. Oh wow,

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,840
is that only on the 25th? It's the Grinch!

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,760
Oh god, the kids think he's here to steal the Christmas!

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,000
And they're fighting! You can't take my Christmas! Oh my god, these kids are losing it.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Oh my god, they're really... I'm stealing your gifts, kid!

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,480
Like those kids were, like they were true believers, they were actually losing it!

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,040
That the Grinch has come to legitimately take their Christmas, oh my god. I wonder if that

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,400
would traumatize them, you know? I mean, probably not, but who knows?

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,320
Oh god, speaking of traumatizing kids, I've seen this next one, guys.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,840
Parent hack. Wrap fake presents when kids don't want to listen,

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,080
and throw the fakes in the fire. Instantly straightens them up. Oh god.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,840
Take the fake gift.

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,840
I wonder if that...

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
I mean, yeah, the kid...

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,360
Oh, see? Yeah, they're being bad, but like, this is probably traumatizing.

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
I mean, they might deserve it, who knows how bad they're being, but still.

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,760
Oh, I guess you're vacuuming your room now!

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I remember being like a defiant little shit when I was a kid, you know?

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,720
Like, stuff getting taken away, I didn't care. I got grounded, I would just like shrug it off.

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,760
Punishing me didn't really work. In fact, I was much more likely to not do what they said

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,200
after they punished me, you know? Just like, it's like, oh, you want to do that to me?

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,120
Now I'm really not cleaning my room, fuck you. Like, that was my attitude as a kid.

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,960
I was a defiant little shit, that's for sure.

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,320
The difference between black and white Santa.

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
Merry Christmas, ho ho ho.

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,260
Okay.

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
That's gotta be a troll. Okay, someone splice that in.

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,880
That's not real, guys, come on! I mean, it's funny, but still, that's not real.

38
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,760
There's another Grinch one?

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,520
It's the- it is! This one's energetic. Oh, oh my god, he stole the whole tree!

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:06,720
Oh my god, yeah, that kid's sad, but...

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,040
Okay, that Grinch, like, the other guy, he was like trying to duck being hit by the kid.

42
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,960
This guy just flies in, steals the tree. Oh my god, dude, man.

43
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,560
These are some quality trolls, I will say. I hope it doesn't leave these kids scarred.

44
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
And if it doesn't, then these are some excellent trolling.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,200
This one's got no audio. Looks like a guy holding a- what is that?

46
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,320
Oh, he's a PS5 and he's smiling. And he's like, I gotta hold this. Oh, oh, the regret.

47
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,400
The Christmas season, dude. You gotta get some kitchen

48
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,120
appliances instead of a PS5. Though, to be fair, the PS5 has no games, so...

49
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,440
Wait, this guy's actually stealing Christmas!

50
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,920
An actual robber stealing Chri- this is a real Grinch, dude, look at this guy!

51
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,800
He's a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

52
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Wow. I mean, before we were trolling, this guy's actually stealing some kid's Christmas.

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,000
What a piece of shit, dude! You can't hold off in the rampant thievery just for Christmas?

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
You gotta ruin some kid's Christmas day? Oh man, these are some nice lights.

55
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
Oh, dude, look at the Santa! Man, that's actually quite nice.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,760
That's... that's looking pretty good. I wonder how he has it going up there.

57
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,880
Is there like a track that you just can't see, or... I don't know, man.

58
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,960
It was no, you know, Clark Griswold, but still, it's pretty good, it's pretty good.

59
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,920
Actually, when Naomi and I went back to my hometown to visit my parents and some other

60
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,200
family members who were still there, it was boring as hell back there, right?

61
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,240
So we decided to take one evening and just hop in the car and slow drive around town

62
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,080
to look at all of the lights. You know, some people do this sometimes,

63
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,920
just go see what the lights look like this year, and there were some pretty decent lights.

64
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,120
There was one house that was kind of like this one, they just didn't have the Santa

65
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,840
going quite so high, but there was like a moving Santa going around the front lawn.

66
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,720
It's like, damn, Christmas decorations are kind of...

67
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,720
they're getting really complex nowadays, aren't they? Like before, back in the day,

68
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,960
when I was a kid, it was lights and it was sometimes statues in the front lawn.

69
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,760
Now you have like display lights shining up, like projecting onto the house.

70
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,400
You have inflatables, you have like just crazy stuff going on nowadays.

71
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
And speaking of inflatables, look at this. Let's take a look.

72
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
When your neighbors are homophobes and it's December.

73
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:08,640
What? Oh, is this supposed to be like an LGBT Christmas where you hump a tree?

74
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,720
Is that part of being LGBT now? Or is it just being in a furry... a unicorn furry costume?

75
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
What? Where's the homophobic? I mean, yeah, there's rainbow, but who cares?

76
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Okay, dude. Wait, did you just dance outside the whole time, hoping that your neighbors

77
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,920
would see you? I guess that is a thing that happened. Sorry to use the millennial writing

78
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,680
phrase. Oh, yeah. Okay, so these are some like climate protesters. I got to mute it,

79
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,280
it's way too fucking loud. Okay, these are some climate protesters and they're spraying

80
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,200
oil onto a Christmas tree at some mall or inside some building or something, right?

81
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,920
I got to do a video on these guys where they just like, they destroy things and they sit

82
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,120
in traffic trying to get something going for climate, like climate justice, and it's always

83
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,880
bullshit. But yeah, they're just menaces. They're just fucking menaces. They destroy things,

84
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,760
they ruin everyone's day, and then they hold a banner and it says,

85
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,280
climate justice, we need to adopt socialism to prevent the planet from lighting on fire

86
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,680
spontaneously. Like, these are the most insufferable fucking people, dude.

87
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,600
You and me both, brother.

88
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,580
Yeah.

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,500
Oh my God.

90
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,180
Dude.

91
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,900
Damn.

92
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,520
To be fair, to be fair.

93
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,320
It's because there's no trees in New York, man, like naturally.

94
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
Holy shit.

95
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
Yeah, dude, dude.

96
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,820
Yeah.

97
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,140
Yep.

98
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,440
Listen, dude, listen, you got to get yourself one of those Charlie Brown trees that can only

99
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,640
hold like one ornament. That's the way to go. But yeah, dude, like living in New York's expensive.

100
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,320
That's a guy who's bringing in trees from the outside because there's no trees growing

101
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,880
naturally in New York anywhere. And he's like, hey, I'm going to sell them to rich people here

102
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,680
who will pay $500 for a tree. If you can drive 10 minutes over to Jersey,

103
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,320
get a cheaper one, you should do that. What are we looking at here, dude?

104
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,640
It's like a terracotta army of snowmen.

105
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,560
Hope I'm not getting copyright strict for this. Oh my God. How many, how many snowmen?

106
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,280
Oh, they got a machine make them. Okay. All right. It's like in Calvin and Hobbes

107
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,080
where he's always making like grotesque snowmen, like landscapes. It's great.

108
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,760
Merry Christmas.

109
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,840
Everyone had a lovely holiday season and that I hope if you have any laptop music,

110
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,480
that they can use stones and they get their car keys stolen at Food Lion and then they have to

111
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,960
live at Food Lion for the rest of their days. No taxis to pick them up or Ubers or anything.

112
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,840
What the fuck? This has like some, um,

113
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,120
can you fix her fellows? Can you fix it? I don't know.

114
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:37,280
Okay. All right, dude. That's some real 2012 vine energy going on there. Didn't it? Oh my God.

115
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:53,040
Okay. Grandma. I mean, you do you. Okay. Now this one reminds me of like people of Walmart.

116
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,320
You guys ever visit that subreddit where it's just the craziest, trashiest shit. Wait.

117
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,880
I think they're in a Walmart, dude. Yeah. That blue cart, the signs. This is a Walmart. Oh my God.

118
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,200
Art imitates life. Oh, it's this guy again. Wait, what the, what the fuck?

119
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:23,360
He puts snowflakes in his, in his haircut. Man. Every time I see a TikTok of this guy,

120
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,440
he's always just fucking cringe. Though I think it might be like a female to male transfer. I don't,

121
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,960
I don't fucking know, dude. I don't, uh, I just, maybe this is just a case of me being old. Like

122
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,400
I don't get the zoomers anymore. You know, I just don't get it. There's one final TikTok in the

123
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,280
Christmas folder and I know exactly what it is. This is a great one to end it on. Oh yeah. Merry

124
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:55,760
Christmas, baby. I'm totally getting copyright struck now. Santa deniers are seething right now.

125
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,080
Anyway, I hope you all had an incredible, uh, Christmas, Christmas Eve, Christmas day,

126
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,320
boxing day. If you don't celebrate boxing day, what the fuck is wrong with you?

127
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,360
And I will see you guys next time. Have a good one. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.

128
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,880
Enjoy the new year. Whenever that comes around. Wait, that's like in like in a few days.

129
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,640
How did I forget the new year comes around for Christmas? Okay.

130
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,240
All right. Okay. I'll see you next time. Goodbye.
