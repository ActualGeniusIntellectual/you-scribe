00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Merry Christmas everyone! I'm recording this on Christmas Day! But you're getting it on Boxing Day,

00:06.320 --> 00:12.000
December 26th, which is still technically within the Christmas season. Though I've heard Americans

00:12.000 --> 00:17.360
don't actually celebrate Boxing Day, so TLDR, if you're in an English-speaking country that isn't

00:17.360 --> 00:23.840
America, the UK, Canada, Australia, etc., we all celebrate Boxing Day. And it's part of the

00:23.840 --> 00:27.440
Christmas lineup for us. So even though this is coming out on Tuesday, it's still the season,

00:27.440 --> 00:32.000
at least for me. I hope you've all enjoyed your Christmas, and let's take a look at some

00:32.000 --> 00:33.760
Christmas TikToks. Here we go.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.720
I wonder what's wrong with the car. Oh no, RIP. I wonder if that's like a mode you can set up in

00:42.720 --> 00:47.920
your car, or if that car is actually just borked. Also, I just noticed VLC, which is what I use to

00:47.920 --> 00:53.120
watch all the TikToks I've accumulated. It has a little Christmas thing going on today. Oh wow,

00:53.120 --> 00:57.840
is that only on the 25th? It's the Grinch!

01:02.880 --> 01:05.760
Oh god, the kids think he's here to steal the Christmas!

01:08.080 --> 01:14.000
And they're fighting! You can't take my Christmas! Oh my god, these kids are losing it.

01:14.000 --> 01:26.800
Oh my god, they're really... I'm stealing your gifts, kid!

01:34.720 --> 01:38.480
Like those kids were, like they were true believers, they were actually losing it!

01:38.480 --> 01:43.040
That the Grinch has come to legitimately take their Christmas, oh my god. I wonder if that

01:43.040 --> 01:46.400
would traumatize them, you know? I mean, probably not, but who knows?

01:46.400 --> 01:50.320
Oh god, speaking of traumatizing kids, I've seen this next one, guys.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.840
Parent hack. Wrap fake presents when kids don't want to listen,

01:53.840 --> 01:58.080
and throw the fakes in the fire. Instantly straightens them up. Oh god.

02:06.880 --> 02:07.840
Take the fake gift.

02:13.040 --> 02:17.840
I wonder if that...

02:26.160 --> 02:27.200
I mean, yeah, the kid...

02:33.200 --> 02:39.360
Oh, see? Yeah, they're being bad, but like, this is probably traumatizing.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.840
I mean, they might deserve it, who knows how bad they're being, but still.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.760
Oh, I guess you're vacuuming your room now!

02:51.600 --> 02:55.600
I remember being like a defiant little shit when I was a kid, you know?

02:55.600 --> 03:00.720
Like, stuff getting taken away, I didn't care. I got grounded, I would just like shrug it off.

03:00.720 --> 03:05.760
Punishing me didn't really work. In fact, I was much more likely to not do what they said

03:05.760 --> 03:09.200
after they punished me, you know? Just like, it's like, oh, you want to do that to me?

03:09.200 --> 03:13.120
Now I'm really not cleaning my room, fuck you. Like, that was my attitude as a kid.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.960
I was a defiant little shit, that's for sure.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.320
The difference between black and white Santa.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.400
Merry Christmas, ho ho ho.

03:25.760 --> 03:26.260
Okay.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.080
That's gotta be a troll. Okay, someone splice that in.

03:34.080 --> 03:40.880
That's not real, guys, come on! I mean, it's funny, but still, that's not real.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.760
There's another Grinch one?

03:46.720 --> 03:51.520
It's the- it is! This one's energetic. Oh, oh my god, he stole the whole tree!

03:52.480 --> 04:06.720
Oh my god, yeah, that kid's sad, but...

04:09.600 --> 04:15.040
Okay, that Grinch, like, the other guy, he was like trying to duck being hit by the kid.

04:15.040 --> 04:20.960
This guy just flies in, steals the tree. Oh my god, dude, man.

04:22.080 --> 04:26.560
These are some quality trolls, I will say. I hope it doesn't leave these kids scarred.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.000
And if it doesn't, then these are some excellent trolling.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.200
This one's got no audio. Looks like a guy holding a- what is that?

04:33.920 --> 04:40.320
Oh, he's a PS5 and he's smiling. And he's like, I gotta hold this. Oh, oh, the regret.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.400
The Christmas season, dude. You gotta get some kitchen

04:44.400 --> 04:49.120
appliances instead of a PS5. Though, to be fair, the PS5 has no games, so...

04:53.200 --> 04:55.440
Wait, this guy's actually stealing Christmas!

05:06.160 --> 05:09.920
An actual robber stealing Chri- this is a real Grinch, dude, look at this guy!

05:10.400 --> 05:16.800
He's a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

05:22.800 --> 05:28.480
Wow. I mean, before we were trolling, this guy's actually stealing some kid's Christmas.

05:28.480 --> 05:34.000
What a piece of shit, dude! You can't hold off in the rampant thievery just for Christmas?

05:34.000 --> 05:38.240
You gotta ruin some kid's Christmas day? Oh man, these are some nice lights.

05:38.240 --> 05:43.360
Oh, dude, look at the Santa! Man, that's actually quite nice.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.760
That's... that's looking pretty good. I wonder how he has it going up there.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.880
Is there like a track that you just can't see, or... I don't know, man.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.960
It was no, you know, Clark Griswold, but still, it's pretty good, it's pretty good.

05:56.960 --> 06:03.920
Actually, when Naomi and I went back to my hometown to visit my parents and some other

06:03.920 --> 06:09.200
family members who were still there, it was boring as hell back there, right?

06:09.200 --> 06:14.240
So we decided to take one evening and just hop in the car and slow drive around town

06:14.240 --> 06:18.080
to look at all of the lights. You know, some people do this sometimes,

06:18.080 --> 06:21.920
just go see what the lights look like this year, and there were some pretty decent lights.

06:21.920 --> 06:27.120
There was one house that was kind of like this one, they just didn't have the Santa

06:27.120 --> 06:31.840
going quite so high, but there was like a moving Santa going around the front lawn.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.720
It's like, damn, Christmas decorations are kind of...

06:35.520 --> 06:38.720
they're getting really complex nowadays, aren't they? Like before, back in the day,

06:38.720 --> 06:42.960
when I was a kid, it was lights and it was sometimes statues in the front lawn.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.760
Now you have like display lights shining up, like projecting onto the house.

06:47.760 --> 06:52.400
You have inflatables, you have like just crazy stuff going on nowadays.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.880
And speaking of inflatables, look at this. Let's take a look.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.720
When your neighbors are homophobes and it's December.

06:58.720 --> 07:08.640
What? Oh, is this supposed to be like an LGBT Christmas where you hump a tree?

07:10.080 --> 07:16.720
Is that part of being LGBT now? Or is it just being in a furry... a unicorn furry costume?

07:16.720 --> 07:21.520
What? Where's the homophobic? I mean, yeah, there's rainbow, but who cares?

07:22.240 --> 07:27.680
Okay, dude. Wait, did you just dance outside the whole time, hoping that your neighbors

07:27.680 --> 07:31.920
would see you? I guess that is a thing that happened. Sorry to use the millennial writing

07:31.920 --> 07:37.680
phrase. Oh, yeah. Okay, so these are some like climate protesters. I got to mute it,

07:37.680 --> 07:41.280
it's way too fucking loud. Okay, these are some climate protesters and they're spraying

07:41.280 --> 07:45.200
oil onto a Christmas tree at some mall or inside some building or something, right?

07:45.840 --> 07:49.920
I got to do a video on these guys where they just like, they destroy things and they sit

07:49.920 --> 07:55.120
in traffic trying to get something going for climate, like climate justice, and it's always

07:55.120 --> 08:00.880
bullshit. But yeah, they're just menaces. They're just fucking menaces. They destroy things,

08:02.480 --> 08:05.760
they ruin everyone's day, and then they hold a banner and it says,

08:06.400 --> 08:13.280
climate justice, we need to adopt socialism to prevent the planet from lighting on fire

08:13.280 --> 08:17.680
spontaneously. Like, these are the most insufferable fucking people, dude.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.600
You and me both, brother.

08:26.080 --> 08:26.580
Yeah.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.500
Oh my God.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.180
Dude.

08:48.400 --> 08:48.900
Damn.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.520
To be fair, to be fair.

08:55.120 --> 09:02.320
It's because there's no trees in New York, man, like naturally.

09:10.000 --> 09:10.800
Holy shit.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.360
Yeah, dude, dude.

09:24.320 --> 09:24.820
Yeah.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.140
Yep.

09:41.040 --> 09:45.440
Listen, dude, listen, you got to get yourself one of those Charlie Brown trees that can only

09:45.440 --> 09:50.640
hold like one ornament. That's the way to go. But yeah, dude, like living in New York's expensive.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.320
That's a guy who's bringing in trees from the outside because there's no trees growing

09:54.320 --> 09:58.880
naturally in New York anywhere. And he's like, hey, I'm going to sell them to rich people here

09:58.880 --> 10:03.680
who will pay $500 for a tree. If you can drive 10 minutes over to Jersey,

10:03.680 --> 10:10.320
get a cheaper one, you should do that. What are we looking at here, dude?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.640
It's like a terracotta army of snowmen.

10:16.640 --> 10:24.560
Hope I'm not getting copyright strict for this. Oh my God. How many, how many snowmen?

10:26.400 --> 10:31.280
Oh, they got a machine make them. Okay. All right. It's like in Calvin and Hobbes

10:31.280 --> 10:36.080
where he's always making like grotesque snowmen, like landscapes. It's great.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.760
Merry Christmas.

10:41.760 --> 10:49.840
Everyone had a lovely holiday season and that I hope if you have any laptop music,

10:51.040 --> 10:56.480
that they can use stones and they get their car keys stolen at Food Lion and then they have to

10:56.480 --> 11:02.960
live at Food Lion for the rest of their days. No taxis to pick them up or Ubers or anything.

11:02.960 --> 11:09.840
What the fuck? This has like some, um,

11:17.680 --> 11:21.120
can you fix her fellows? Can you fix it? I don't know.

11:21.120 --> 11:37.280
Okay. All right, dude. That's some real 2012 vine energy going on there. Didn't it? Oh my God.

11:37.280 --> 11:53.040
Okay. Grandma. I mean, you do you. Okay. Now this one reminds me of like people of Walmart.

11:53.040 --> 11:58.320
You guys ever visit that subreddit where it's just the craziest, trashiest shit. Wait.

11:58.320 --> 12:06.880
I think they're in a Walmart, dude. Yeah. That blue cart, the signs. This is a Walmart. Oh my God.

12:06.880 --> 12:13.200
Art imitates life. Oh, it's this guy again. Wait, what the, what the fuck?

12:15.040 --> 12:23.360
He puts snowflakes in his, in his haircut. Man. Every time I see a TikTok of this guy,

12:23.360 --> 12:29.440
he's always just fucking cringe. Though I think it might be like a female to male transfer. I don't,

12:29.440 --> 12:34.960
I don't fucking know, dude. I don't, uh, I just, maybe this is just a case of me being old. Like

12:34.960 --> 12:40.400
I don't get the zoomers anymore. You know, I just don't get it. There's one final TikTok in the

12:40.400 --> 12:47.280
Christmas folder and I know exactly what it is. This is a great one to end it on. Oh yeah. Merry

12:47.280 --> 12:55.760
Christmas, baby. I'm totally getting copyright struck now. Santa deniers are seething right now.

12:56.480 --> 13:04.080
Anyway, I hope you all had an incredible, uh, Christmas, Christmas Eve, Christmas day,

13:04.080 --> 13:08.320
boxing day. If you don't celebrate boxing day, what the fuck is wrong with you?

13:08.320 --> 13:15.360
And I will see you guys next time. Have a good one. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.880
Enjoy the new year. Whenever that comes around. Wait, that's like in like in a few days.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.640
How did I forget the new year comes around for Christmas? Okay.

13:22.640 --> 13:28.240
All right. Okay. I'll see you next time. Goodbye.
