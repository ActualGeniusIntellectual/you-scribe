0	6320	Merry Christmas everyone! I'm recording this on Christmas Day! But you're getting it on Boxing Day,
6320	12000	December 26th, which is still technically within the Christmas season. Though I've heard Americans
12000	17360	don't actually celebrate Boxing Day, so TLDR, if you're in an English-speaking country that isn't
17360	23840	America, the UK, Canada, Australia, etc., we all celebrate Boxing Day. And it's part of the
23840	27440	Christmas lineup for us. So even though this is coming out on Tuesday, it's still the season,
27440	32000	at least for me. I hope you've all enjoyed your Christmas, and let's take a look at some
32000	33760	Christmas TikToks. Here we go.
37840	42720	I wonder what's wrong with the car. Oh no, RIP. I wonder if that's like a mode you can set up in
42720	47920	your car, or if that car is actually just borked. Also, I just noticed VLC, which is what I use to
47920	53120	watch all the TikToks I've accumulated. It has a little Christmas thing going on today. Oh wow,
53120	57840	is that only on the 25th? It's the Grinch!
62880	65760	Oh god, the kids think he's here to steal the Christmas!
68080	74000	And they're fighting! You can't take my Christmas! Oh my god, these kids are losing it.
74000	86800	Oh my god, they're really... I'm stealing your gifts, kid!
94720	98480	Like those kids were, like they were true believers, they were actually losing it!
98480	103040	That the Grinch has come to legitimately take their Christmas, oh my god. I wonder if that
103040	106400	would traumatize them, you know? I mean, probably not, but who knows?
106400	110320	Oh god, speaking of traumatizing kids, I've seen this next one, guys.
110320	113840	Parent hack. Wrap fake presents when kids don't want to listen,
113840	118080	and throw the fakes in the fire. Instantly straightens them up. Oh god.
126880	127840	Take the fake gift.
133040	137840	I wonder if that...
146160	147200	I mean, yeah, the kid...
153200	159360	Oh, see? Yeah, they're being bad, but like, this is probably traumatizing.
159360	161840	I mean, they might deserve it, who knows how bad they're being, but still.
163680	167760	Oh, I guess you're vacuuming your room now!
171600	175600	I remember being like a defiant little shit when I was a kid, you know?
175600	180720	Like, stuff getting taken away, I didn't care. I got grounded, I would just like shrug it off.
180720	185760	Punishing me didn't really work. In fact, I was much more likely to not do what they said
185760	189200	after they punished me, you know? Just like, it's like, oh, you want to do that to me?
189200	193120	Now I'm really not cleaning my room, fuck you. Like, that was my attitude as a kid.
193120	194960	I was a defiant little shit, that's for sure.
195920	198320	The difference between black and white Santa.
201040	202400	Merry Christmas, ho ho ho.
205760	206260	Okay.
210720	214080	That's gotta be a troll. Okay, someone splice that in.
214080	220880	That's not real, guys, come on! I mean, it's funny, but still, that's not real.
222720	223760	There's another Grinch one?
226720	231520	It's the- it is! This one's energetic. Oh, oh my god, he stole the whole tree!
232480	246720	Oh my god, yeah, that kid's sad, but...
249600	255040	Okay, that Grinch, like, the other guy, he was like trying to duck being hit by the kid.
255040	260960	This guy just flies in, steals the tree. Oh my god, dude, man.
262080	266560	These are some quality trolls, I will say. I hope it doesn't leave these kids scarred.
266560	270000	And if it doesn't, then these are some excellent trolling.
270000	273200	This one's got no audio. Looks like a guy holding a- what is that?
273920	280320	Oh, he's a PS5 and he's smiling. And he's like, I gotta hold this. Oh, oh, the regret.
280320	284400	The Christmas season, dude. You gotta get some kitchen
284400	289120	appliances instead of a PS5. Though, to be fair, the PS5 has no games, so...
293200	295440	Wait, this guy's actually stealing Christmas!
306160	309920	An actual robber stealing Chri- this is a real Grinch, dude, look at this guy!
310400	316800	He's a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
322800	328480	Wow. I mean, before we were trolling, this guy's actually stealing some kid's Christmas.
328480	334000	What a piece of shit, dude! You can't hold off in the rampant thievery just for Christmas?
334000	338240	You gotta ruin some kid's Christmas day? Oh man, these are some nice lights.
338240	343360	Oh, dude, look at the Santa! Man, that's actually quite nice.
344000	349760	That's... that's looking pretty good. I wonder how he has it going up there.
349760	352880	Is there like a track that you just can't see, or... I don't know, man.
353760	356960	It was no, you know, Clark Griswold, but still, it's pretty good, it's pretty good.
356960	363920	Actually, when Naomi and I went back to my hometown to visit my parents and some other
363920	369200	family members who were still there, it was boring as hell back there, right?
369200	374240	So we decided to take one evening and just hop in the car and slow drive around town
374240	378080	to look at all of the lights. You know, some people do this sometimes,
378080	381920	just go see what the lights look like this year, and there were some pretty decent lights.
381920	387120	There was one house that was kind of like this one, they just didn't have the Santa
387120	391840	going quite so high, but there was like a moving Santa going around the front lawn.
391840	394720	It's like, damn, Christmas decorations are kind of...
395520	398720	they're getting really complex nowadays, aren't they? Like before, back in the day,
398720	402960	when I was a kid, it was lights and it was sometimes statues in the front lawn.
402960	407760	Now you have like display lights shining up, like projecting onto the house.
407760	412400	You have inflatables, you have like just crazy stuff going on nowadays.
412400	414880	And speaking of inflatables, look at this. Let's take a look.
415440	418720	When your neighbors are homophobes and it's December.
418720	428640	What? Oh, is this supposed to be like an LGBT Christmas where you hump a tree?
430080	436720	Is that part of being LGBT now? Or is it just being in a furry... a unicorn furry costume?
436720	441520	What? Where's the homophobic? I mean, yeah, there's rainbow, but who cares?
442240	447680	Okay, dude. Wait, did you just dance outside the whole time, hoping that your neighbors
447680	451920	would see you? I guess that is a thing that happened. Sorry to use the millennial writing
451920	457680	phrase. Oh, yeah. Okay, so these are some like climate protesters. I got to mute it,
457680	461280	it's way too fucking loud. Okay, these are some climate protesters and they're spraying
461280	465200	oil onto a Christmas tree at some mall or inside some building or something, right?
465840	469920	I got to do a video on these guys where they just like, they destroy things and they sit
469920	475120	in traffic trying to get something going for climate, like climate justice, and it's always
475120	480880	bullshit. But yeah, they're just menaces. They're just fucking menaces. They destroy things,
482480	485760	they ruin everyone's day, and then they hold a banner and it says,
486400	493280	climate justice, we need to adopt socialism to prevent the planet from lighting on fire
493280	497680	spontaneously. Like, these are the most insufferable fucking people, dude.
500640	501600	You and me both, brother.
506080	506580	Yeah.
512000	512500	Oh my God.
521680	522180	Dude.
528400	528900	Damn.
529840	531520	To be fair, to be fair.
535120	542320	It's because there's no trees in New York, man, like naturally.
550000	550800	Holy shit.
562080	563360	Yeah, dude, dude.
564320	564820	Yeah.
570640	571140	Yep.
581040	585440	Listen, dude, listen, you got to get yourself one of those Charlie Brown trees that can only
585440	590640	hold like one ornament. That's the way to go. But yeah, dude, like living in New York's expensive.
590640	594320	That's a guy who's bringing in trees from the outside because there's no trees growing
594320	598880	naturally in New York anywhere. And he's like, hey, I'm going to sell them to rich people here
598880	603680	who will pay $500 for a tree. If you can drive 10 minutes over to Jersey,
603680	610320	get a cheaper one, you should do that. What are we looking at here, dude?
613920	616640	It's like a terracotta army of snowmen.
616640	624560	Hope I'm not getting copyright strict for this. Oh my God. How many, how many snowmen?
626400	631280	Oh, they got a machine make them. Okay. All right. It's like in Calvin and Hobbes
631280	636080	where he's always making like grotesque snowmen, like landscapes. It's great.
640960	641760	Merry Christmas.
641760	649840	Everyone had a lovely holiday season and that I hope if you have any laptop music,
651040	656480	that they can use stones and they get their car keys stolen at Food Lion and then they have to
656480	662960	live at Food Lion for the rest of their days. No taxis to pick them up or Ubers or anything.
662960	669840	What the fuck? This has like some, um,
677680	681120	can you fix her fellows? Can you fix it? I don't know.
681120	697280	Okay. All right, dude. That's some real 2012 vine energy going on there. Didn't it? Oh my God.
697280	713040	Okay. Grandma. I mean, you do you. Okay. Now this one reminds me of like people of Walmart.
713040	718320	You guys ever visit that subreddit where it's just the craziest, trashiest shit. Wait.
718320	726880	I think they're in a Walmart, dude. Yeah. That blue cart, the signs. This is a Walmart. Oh my God.
726880	733200	Art imitates life. Oh, it's this guy again. Wait, what the, what the fuck?
735040	743360	He puts snowflakes in his, in his haircut. Man. Every time I see a TikTok of this guy,
743360	749440	he's always just fucking cringe. Though I think it might be like a female to male transfer. I don't,
749440	754960	I don't fucking know, dude. I don't, uh, I just, maybe this is just a case of me being old. Like
754960	760400	I don't get the zoomers anymore. You know, I just don't get it. There's one final TikTok in the
760400	767280	Christmas folder and I know exactly what it is. This is a great one to end it on. Oh yeah. Merry
767280	775760	Christmas, baby. I'm totally getting copyright struck now. Santa deniers are seething right now.
776480	784080	Anyway, I hope you all had an incredible, uh, Christmas, Christmas Eve, Christmas day,
784080	788320	boxing day. If you don't celebrate boxing day, what the fuck is wrong with you?
788320	795360	And I will see you guys next time. Have a good one. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.
795360	798880	Enjoy the new year. Whenever that comes around. Wait, that's like in like in a few days.
800240	802640	How did I forget the new year comes around for Christmas? Okay.
802640	808240	All right. Okay. I'll see you next time. Goodbye.
