0	9080	This is a topic I've spoken about before on this channel, and other channels, with
9080	10560	Sargon with Adam and Sitch.
10560	14280	But the idea is kicking off again on social media, and I think I'm now a bit more equipped
14280	16120	to do it justice, so let's give it a go.
16120	20480	This all started with the recent glut of articles proclaiming the end of the all-male, all-white
20480	21720	cockpit.
21720	25880	Some airplane crews are now all-women, or all-black, or all-black women.
25880	27880	And this is cause for celebration.
27880	31960	Where non-white, non-males are being included in the airline industry.
31960	35840	Right now, trolls are reposting these triumphant articles, alongside the couple of stories
35840	39020	coming out recently, where planes are malfunctioning mid-flight.
39020	40760	Which is a pretty good joke, I gotta admit.
40760	45320	But the general normie reply to the celebration of the end of the all-white, all-male cockpit
45320	50360	is best exemplified by Andrew Wilko's simple take, can't we just hire the best person
50360	51360	for the job?
51360	55740	And I personally agree, that was the point of the whole content of their character and
55740	57660	not the color of their skin thing.
57660	62140	But today's racial activists have largely forgotten that liberalism means color blindness,
62140	63360	not racial privilege.
63360	68180	Aaron McIntyre replied with, no, civil rights law has made that illegal.
68180	72820	Diversity, equity, inclusion isn't some crazy form of communism, though its proponents
72820	73820	are often neo-Marxists.
73820	78680	DEI is the natural evolution of civil rights law, that is why it was able to take hold
78680	79680	so easily.
79680	83860	And until you are willing to unwind that leviathan, this is the world you'll live in.
84020	88280	Tim Poole chimed in with a simple, yep, and James Lindsay replied with a simple, nope,
88280	95280	agreeing with a commenter that Tim Poole is big wrong and DEI is 100% communism, not liberalism.
95280	99120	Sargon then jumped in, saying communism isn't separate from liberalism.
99120	102260	James Lindsay replied with, your opinion sucks lol.
102260	104840	Sargon simply said, it seems to be correct, though.
104840	107120	Lindsay remarked, to who, simpletons?
107120	111600	Sargon said, to the people who understand the genealogy and purpose of these philosophies.
111600	116200	Lindsay simply said, lol ok, with Sargon agreeing it's a hard pill to swallow.
116200	120360	Lindsay then retorted with, it's just wrong, rejecting the offer to talk to Sargon about
120360	123480	the topic, or any other topic, saying he doesn't respect him.
123480	127920	Sargon's final reply before James Lindsay blocked him was, that's a shame, James,
127920	131840	because between us I'm the one who actually understands liberalism and why it's brought
131840	133200	us to the position that we're in.
133200	137680	You are far too emotionally committed to see the woods for the trees, and are being incredibly
137680	139640	rude to defend your lack of knowledge.
139680	142640	Yeah, James was kinda rude in this exchange, not gonna lie.
142640	144880	He is pretty knowledgeable on some things, though.
144880	148640	I know he has no idea who I am, but I bet if he watched my video on Antonio Gramsci,
148640	150140	he would probably agree with it.
150140	154320	He said similar things in the topic himself, tracing the genealogy of modern-day diversity
154320	158240	movements back through the civil rights movement, which was mentored in critical theory by the
158240	162060	Frankfurt School, who brought the philosophy to America from the leftist intellectual scene
162060	166220	in Europe, where it was first conceptualized as Western Marxism in order to distinguish
166220	170820	it from Eastern Soviet Marxism, all stemming from the Italian socialist Antonio Gramsci,
170820	174900	who was active in the socialist movement from the 1910s until he was imprisoned by Mussolini.
174900	178820	I go into detail on all of these events in my Gramsci video, and it's also stuff that
178820	180920	Lindsay's spoken about publicly as well.
180920	185060	He knows that there's a traceable lineage from Gramsci's ideas to modern-day racial
185060	189420	activism, and therefore liberalism, being a different philosophy than socialism and
189420	194780	quite opposed to it, should also reject modern-day racial activism for being anti-liberal and
194780	196460	socialist in disguise.
196460	201120	However, Sargon is making the claim that there is a similar traceable lineage from liberalism
201120	205540	to socialism, and that despite the liberal world's great successes, the philosophy
205540	209580	of liberalism contains within it key flaws that have been carried forward through that
209580	213860	lineage into socialism, where they are now causing problems for us today.
213860	217540	And although James Lindsay never properly engages with the idea in the tweet thread,
217540	221500	simply brushing Sargon off instead, if you examined the writings of liberals, just as
221500	224860	you'd examined the writings of Antonio Gramsci or the Frankfurt School or the civil
224860	228180	rights activists, you'd realize that Sargon's actually got a point.
228180	231340	And no, it's not because he's my friend, let me explain how.
231340	236340	Helen Pluckrose, the co-author of James Lindsay's book, Cynical Theories, which is about postmodernism
236340	240180	and ideological bias in academia, also jumped into the conversation.
240180	243460	James Lindsay and I disagree on many things, but Carl's thoughts on liberalism being
243460	246620	uninformed and not worth respecting are not among them.
246620	250520	I can't do anything with liberalism is communism, just like I can't do anything with fish
250540	251540	or birds.
251540	254040	A definitional error is the only explanation.
254040	257960	She later expanded, if Sargon means that both liberalism and communism are the products
257960	261800	of humans, and this is just trivially true, I must assume it means more.
261800	263380	I'm going on what it says here.
263380	266840	And then she links Sargon's article, The Five False Assumptions of Liberalism.
266840	268720	There's no error here on Sargon's part, though.
268720	272240	It's an understanding of liberal philosophy and its shortcomings, hence the title of the
272240	273240	article.
273240	276920	When people say liberal today, if they're not Americans who just mean the left, they're
276920	280120	referring to the philosophy of liberalism and the political institutions that have been
280120	283760	based on it, which I would say is pretty accurately defined in Wikipedia.
283760	288080	Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on the rights of the individual, liberty,
288080	291360	consent of the governed, political equality, right to private property, and equality before
291360	292440	the law.
292440	295840	Liberals expose various views depending on their understanding of these principles, but
295840	300040	generally support private property, market economies, individual rights, including civil
300040	304280	rights and human rights, liberal democracy, secularism, rule of law, economic and political
304280	308200	freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion,
308200	310240	constitutional government, and privacy rights.
310240	313240	As a liberal myself, that sounds pretty accurate to what I believe.
313240	317320	But most liberals in the modern day don't ask themselves why they believe it.
317320	320960	The answer is because they were raised in it, and liberalism is so successful that it's
320960	321960	simply become the norm.
321960	325320	It's the dominant ideology of the modern era, and as such, it doesn't really need
325320	327040	to justify its existence anymore.
327040	328480	It simply is.
328480	333440	What Sargon is asking of James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose is to justify liberalism's
333440	337520	existence, beyond the obvious answer of, it won, which to be fair, it did.
337520	340100	But what is the underpinning, what does it rest on?
340100	341960	That is where their conversation broke down.
341960	344880	So, let's examine what liberalism rests on.
344880	349340	Thomas Hobbes' most famous quote from Leviathan is often misattributed to him describing life
349340	352760	in a democracy as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.
352760	354520	That's not the real context of the quote.
354520	356460	Here's the whole thing so you can understand it.
356460	360520	As long as men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in the condition
360520	364640	known as war, and it is a war of every man against every man.
364640	368700	What constitutes war is not actual fighting, but a known disposition to fight during a
368700	371720	time when there is no assurance to the contrary.
371720	373240	All other time is peace.
373240	377480	Therefore, whatever results from a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man,
377480	381760	also results from a time when men live with no other security but what their own strength
381760	383480	and ingenuity provides them with.
383480	387040	In such conditions, there is no place for hard work, because there is no assurance that
387040	391780	will yield results, and consequently no cultivation of the earth, no navigation or use of materials
391780	395500	that can be imported by sea, no construction of large buildings, no machines for moving
395500	399820	things that require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time,
399820	404820	no practical skills, no literature or scholarship, no society, and worst of all, continual fear
404820	410820	and danger of violent death and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.
410820	414180	What Hobbes is saying here is that in the absence of an overarching authority, whether
414180	418780	that be a strong king from his time or a modern government, humans living in a state of anarchy
418780	423020	is the same as humans living in a state of perpetual warfare, where nobody builds anything
423020	426420	or invests for the future because there's no guarantee it won't simply be taken from
426420	427860	you by somebody else.
427860	431060	But if there's an authority that all the people submit to, then there is at least a
431060	435940	standard of law and an understanding of kinship as fellow subjects of the authority, and this
435940	439180	provides the stability necessary for society to flourish.
439180	443820	John Locke, considered to be the first liberal, wrote that in a state of nature, a time in
443820	447700	human prehistory before the first governments appeared, some humans would indeed live, as
447700	451940	Hobbes described, brutes locked in eternal warfare without an authority to unite them.
451940	456220	But Locke insisted that other humans would live by what he dubbed the law of reason,
456220	460520	where rational people would voluntarily choose to not harm each other or their possessions,
460520	462340	knowing it would bring retaliation.
462340	466700	For Locke, a society completely comprised of rational humans didn't need the overarching
466700	470140	authority of a government, as reason would provide the social balance.
470140	474900	But the brutes still exist, acting irrationally and disrupting the balance, and so reasonable
474900	479000	people enter into a voluntary contract with each other to form a government to protect
479000	480120	against the brutes.
480120	484440	Jean-Jacques Rousseau, considered to be the other first liberal, pushed this idea of the
484440	486040	state of nature to its extreme.
486040	491180	It was his belief that humans simply acted as solitary animals, wandering, eating, hunting,
491180	492880	and sleeping as they liked.
492880	496740	Because nature provided for all of his wants, he would have no reason to fight other humans,
496740	500640	and he would generally be disinterested in other people should they cross paths.
500640	503640	Men and women would occasionally meet up to reproduce, after which the man would go off
503640	506440	on his own way, and the woman would care for the children until they were old enough
506440	507920	to go off on their own.
507920	512520	Living separately, humans would not know envy or distrust for each other, and neither property
512520	514440	nor conflict would exist.
514440	517880	Rousseau believed that prehistoric humans existed as isolated individuals with little
517880	520240	differences between them, just as a lot of animals do.
520240	524720	What he describes is, in fact, how bears in Canada and the Northern United States actually
524720	529080	live, as isolated individuals keeping to themselves, spending their days hunting and foraging,
529080	530560	only coming together to mate.
530560	533440	Other bears, though they're famous for how protective they are of their offspring,
533440	537560	are also known to attack their own offspring to run them off after they're old enough
537560	541140	to go off on their own, as a way of her returning to her isolation.
541140	543960	And you thought your parents were rough on you after graduation.
543960	548520	When it comes to that humanity-in-the-state-of-nature thought experiment, these three philosophers
548520	552920	— Rousseau, Locke, and Hobbes — exist on a spectrum of idealization, with Rousseau
552920	556760	believing the state of nature was ideal, Hobbes believing it was terrible, and Locke taking
556760	558020	a middle-road approach.
558020	561840	But with modern archaeology, we understand now that Rousseau and Locke's views were
561840	563100	not true.
563100	567500	Human prehistory never contained a period of isolated individualism, nor did it contain
567500	569880	humans who lived by the Law of Reason.
569880	574060	We now know that humans lived in tribes, which were bound together by sentiment, custom,
574060	575060	and culture.
575060	579020	That the justification for those tribes' existence rested in spiritual tradition, family
579020	581300	lineages, and success in war.
581300	585980	And that these were not people of reason and enlightenment, but of superstition and authority.
585980	587880	In other words, Hobbes was correct.
587880	590040	There was no pre-social human.
590040	592160	Humans have always been social beings.
592160	595600	Now you might ask, as Helen Pluckrose did, who cares about this, Dev?
595600	599600	It doesn't matter if old liberal philosophers were wrong about humans in the state of nature.
599600	603000	What does that have to do with the practical, on-the-ground liberalism of today?
603000	607780	Well, the issue is that list of liberal values — the one that I pulled off Wikipedia — their
607780	610160	foundation rests in this thought experiment.
610160	612120	Again, let me show you how.
612120	614120	A common liberal value is equality.
614640	618920	I don't mean socialistic equality of outcomes — everyone owns things in common, equality
618920	620920	— but we will discuss that a little bit later.
620920	625760	I mean liberal equality, which primarily concerns itself with social inequality.
625760	629880	A liberal in medieval Europe might look at the social structure of feudalism and proclaim
629880	634620	that inequality of rank is a social ill, that a different standard of law is applied based
634620	638240	on one social class, and that this state of affairs is immoral.
638240	642760	Rousseau argued that if social inequality is a consequence of society itself, social
642760	646360	inequality would not be an issue in the state of nature.
646360	651000	To him, social inequality was the imposition of society, and humanity's natural state
651000	652320	was equality.
652320	656680	For Locke, he called this state of humanity the tabula rasa, which is Latin for scraped
656680	657680	tablet.
657680	661640	Locke was referring to wax tablets that Romans would use for temporary writing.
661640	665080	They would write on the wax with a stylus, and then once they no longer needed the writing,
665080	669680	a spatula affixed to the other end of the stylus would be used to scrape the wax, flattening
669680	673100	its down to its original form, so that it may be written on once again.
673100	677840	Locke used the scraped tablet example as a metaphor of the human mind, that the individual
677840	683440	is born a blank wax slate, and it is their society and experiences that write the content
683440	685640	of their character into the wax.
685640	689640	Locke would use this metaphor to describe what liberals call nowadays the universal
689640	690640	man.
690640	694600	In modern parlance, if you've ever heard somebody say that if, using the hand of God,
694600	699080	you arbitrarily plucked somebody from society A and placed them into a family in society
699080	703560	B, that person would grow up to be a true member of society B, despite their genetic
703560	704560	difference.
704560	707040	They're appealing to Locke's tabula rasa idea.
707040	711600	In other words, the modern blank slate theory that socialists, progressive activists, and
711600	716240	postmodern scholars lean on when they say that everything is a social construct, and
716240	719720	we should engineer society to create the proper types of people, what they're leaning on
719720	722120	is a classically liberal idea.
722120	726780	Locke's tabula rasa and Rousseau's critique of social inequality are both built on the
726780	731100	assumption that once you peel away all the layers of a human, like an onion, what's
731100	736680	left at the center is some equal, interchangeable humanness, and that we know this is the case
736680	738900	because it existed in the state of nature.
738900	740480	But again, the state of nature is false.
740480	744460	As we continue to examine those liberal values, we can see that they all have their origins
744460	748140	in the debate between Locke, Rousseau, and Hobbes, and that the liberals were generally
748140	749140	wrong about it.
749140	751940	Let's take another liberal value, freedom.
751940	756820	Rousseau famously wrote that man is born free and everywhere else he is in chains.
756820	760880	This again stems from the state of nature, where the isolated individual is free in nature
760880	763660	to do as he likes, and it's society that chains him.
763660	767280	But again, due to archaeology, we know that tribal structures were anything but free.
767280	770920	For Locke, because all people were equal due to the blank slate, any differences between
770920	773180	people were products of society.
773180	777640	Freedom was therefore required because social constructions, like for example class differences,
777640	781060	were not a justification for one person to infringe upon another.
781060	784700	This comes together in what liberals tend to call the social contract, where the roaming
784700	789540	savage voluntarily exits the state of nature and submits himself to a higher authority
789540	793340	in exchange for that authority's protection and the safety of society.
793340	796940	Of course, if you were to ask a social contract liberal, what happens if I don't consent
796940	797940	to the contract?
797940	798980	What happens if I want to alter it?
798980	800240	How can I withdraw from it?
800240	804760	They will generally say that your participation in society and you enjoying its fruits is
804760	808960	your consent to the contract, and that if you truly want to withdraw from it, you must
808960	813360	withdraw from civilization and return to being Locke's roaming savage, Rousseau's
813360	817760	isolated individual, because civilization and all of its fruits are products of the
817760	819080	social contract.
819080	822780	Of course, libertarians are often the first ones to agree to that bargain, smugly pointing
822780	827080	out that almost all land on earth is now under somebody's jurisdiction, and so there is
827080	832540	no place to withdraw to, and that even if large swaths of people reject the social contract,
832540	837320	which has happened before, the state and its enforcement arm nonetheless continue to exist.
837320	838320	And what about rights?
838480	842200	There are many rights that liberals enjoy, and they have been very good for their societies
842200	843200	and the people living in them.
843200	844800	But what's their source?
844800	850120	In Locke's view, the law of reason we spoke about earlier was a component of natural law.
850120	854540	Natural law is a system of law based on a close observation of human nature, and based
854540	859380	on values intrinsic to human nature that can be deduced and applied independently of positive
859380	862680	law, that is, the enacted laws of a state or a society.
862680	867780	According to this view, all people have inherent rights, conferred not by an act of legislation
867780	871000	of a government, but by God, nature, or reason.
871000	874020	At least this is what Wikipedia says again, and again it's pretty accurate.
874020	878740	To put it in modern terms, we can observe human psychology and see how humans ideally
878740	883520	behave, and then our actual governments should construct their on-paper laws to adhere as
883520	886260	closely to that behavior as possible.
886260	890660	This is why, for the modern liberal, they often say law should be downstream from culture,
890660	895180	and that the state should only intervene to protect people's rights, not to itself infringe
895180	898720	upon them with its own moral standard separate from the people's.
898720	902400	The fascists derisively called the state of affairs the Night Watchman state, which
902400	907100	is a term that liberals eventually took for themselves as a self-descriptor of their ideal
907100	908100	government.
908100	912220	For Locke, humans had natural rights which were derived from natural law, but also that
912220	916180	humans voluntarily gave up those rights in exchange for civil rights upon leaving the
916180	918660	state of nature and joining civilization.
918660	923420	In his Second Treatise, he wrote, Men, when they enter into society, give up the equality,
923420	927520	liberty and executive power they had in the state of nature, into the hands of the society,
927520	932340	to be so far disposed of by the legislative, as the good of society shall require.
932340	934400	Rousseau believed much the same thing.
934400	938620	The total alienation of each associate, together with all of his rights to the whole community,
938620	942420	when the prince says to him, it is expedient for the state that you should die, he ought
942420	946620	to die, because it is only on that condition that he has been living in security up to
946620	952220	the present, and because his life is no longer a mere bounty of nature, but a gift made conditionally
952220	953220	by the state.
953220	955220	Here's a quick recap before we go any further.
955220	956660	I'm personally a liberal.
956660	958860	I like the civilization liberalism has built.
958860	963540	But the concept of human rights, which we simply accept as true and good without any
963540	967820	critical thought, because one, that's the society we were born into, and two, our society's
967820	972180	incredible success, this idea has gone unexamined by most modern liberals.
972180	977080	And once we examine the concept of human rights, we must understand it sits atop a very shaky
977080	978780	philosophical foundation.
978780	980860	Why do we have human rights?
980860	982220	There's two answers to that question.
982220	985820	The first one is because having them produces good results, that it's better to have them
985820	987820	than not, and therefore we should.
987820	991180	That is true, but let's set that answer aside for a moment, we'll return to it later.
991180	995340	The second answer is because modern human rights and the older civil rights that they
995340	1000680	superseded, they were both derived from natural rights, that we observed human nature, discovered
1000680	1005700	natural law, and strive to create societies in harmony with that law as best we can.
1005700	1010340	And what is that natural law that we have derived those modern human rights from?
1010340	1013920	The blank slate of Locke and the isolated individual of Rousseau.
1013920	1018780	The moral underpinnings of all of this really does all stem from man in the state of nature.
1018780	1022500	Let's bring it back around to the discussion between Sargon and James Lindsay and Helen
1022500	1023500	Pluckrose.
1023500	1027300	Sargon expanded on that initial statement that got Lindsay so angry, communism isn't
1027300	1028580	separate from liberalism.
1028580	1031620	It frames itself as a critique and postulates a solution.
1031620	1034700	It is clearly an ideological descendant of liberalism.
1034700	1038980	Now personally, I think the statement, communism is an ideological descendant of liberalism,
1038980	1043840	is significantly more accurate than communism isn't separate from liberalism.
1043840	1047260	Communism is separate from liberalism, in the same way that you are separate from your
1047260	1048260	great-grandfather.
1048260	1050620	But I get the point that he's making, and you know what?
1050620	1052180	So do the communists.
1052180	1058520	In 2014, the socialist rag Jacobin published Liberalism's Crisis, Socialism's Promise,
1058520	1063020	with the tagline of socialism isn't the negation of liberalism, it's the realization
1063020	1066380	of liberal values made impossible by capitalism.
1066380	1070180	This sentiment is echoed everywhere, and you can see it with a quick search online
1070180	1072060	of the phrase, promises of liberalism.
1072060	1073820	Here's what's meant by this.
1073820	1078820	The three core philosophical values of liberalism, from which everything else stems, are liberty,
1078820	1080060	equality, and fraternity.
1080060	1084200	They're so iconic, they're actually the motto of many liberal countries, most notably
1084200	1085500	the French Republic.
1085500	1090040	The socialist point of view is that liberalism has failed to uphold these three promises,
1090040	1094260	and that socialism is not the enemy of liberalism, but simply its next phase.
1094660	1097300	Here's how a socialist would view this conversation.
1097300	1098300	Liberty?
1098300	1102860	The liberal might promise you political liberty, bourgeois liberty, but it's of limited use
1102860	1105940	if you're still subject to the whims of a dictator in the workplace.
1105940	1111000	The socialist, therefore, offers more liberty, not just political liberty, but economic liberty,
1111000	1113980	by democratizing not only the government, but private enterprise.
1113980	1114980	Equality?
1114980	1118720	What equality can liberalism offer you if the class divide still exists?
1118720	1124100	The bourgeois still receive preferential treatment not only from civil society, but even in application
1124100	1125100	of the law.
1125100	1128940	The socialist offers true equality through the abolishment of the bourgeois.
1128940	1130060	Fraternity?
1130060	1133260	What fraternity is there when people are divided by class?
1133260	1134920	Solidarity is the true fraternity.
1134920	1138900	The total collectivization of all property and wealth will mean that the fraternity of
1138900	1141120	all of humanity will thrive.
1141120	1146140	This is how many socialists view socialism's relationship with liberalism, including Karl
1146140	1150420	Marx, who famously critiqued the liberal conception of human rights in his essay on the Jewish
1150420	1153460	Question, declaring that they didn't go far enough, that the liberal was too concerned
1153460	1156760	with property rights for any of his other values to ever be fulfilled.
1156760	1161900	For Marx, communism was the ultimate fulfillment of the liberal values of liberty, equality,
1161900	1162900	and fraternity.
1162900	1168460	A stateless, moneyless, classless society would theoretically have maximum liberty.
1168460	1171260	Nobody would ever be coerced to work ever again.
1171260	1172260	Maximum equality.
1172260	1174840	No social classes would ever again exist.
1174840	1175840	Maximum fraternity.
1175840	1178860	All of humanity living in collective kinship.
1178860	1182440	Sometimes you get random retards like Oliver here, who will say something like, communists
1182440	1186580	have always viewed liberalism as their enemy, they are diametrically opposed ideologies.
1186580	1189800	The Cold War ended with liberalism winning over communism.
1189800	1191600	This guy really needs to stay in his lane.
1191600	1195920	It's true that the Cold War was all about one power bloc building a liberal world order,
1195920	1199960	triumphing over a second power bloc building a socialist world order, which would theoretically
1199960	1202020	become communism after its completion.
1202020	1204400	But this isn't a discussion of real politics.
1204400	1208520	Philosophically, the communists do oppose liberalism, but not because they view liberalism
1208520	1209520	as an enemy.
1209520	1213160	They simply view liberalism as outdated, needing replacement.
1213160	1215160	Now the same is not true the other way around.
1215160	1217640	Liberals absolutely view communists as the enemy.
1217640	1218800	But think of it like this.
1218800	1222760	If computer programs could talk, for example, and one version of an application was going
1222760	1226960	to be replaced by version 2, would version 1 view version 2 as an enemy?
1226960	1227960	Of course it would.
1227960	1230560	Would version 2 view version 1 as an enemy?
1230560	1231560	Not at all.
1231560	1234960	They'd simply see their replacement as the natural course of progress.
1234960	1237720	That is how a socialist views liberalism.
1237720	1241280	Helen Pluckrose actually responded to all of this, stating that she wasn't familiar
1241280	1242840	with liberal philosophers.
1242840	1246180	And then she proceeded to make Sargon's own arguments about the flaws of liberalism back
1246180	1247180	to him.
1247180	1250840	I am frankly not surprised that she deactivated her account for a couple of days after that.
1250840	1253560	I don't know if you're watching this video, Helen, I hope you are.
1253560	1258060	The issue isn't that millions, followers of John Stuart Mill, are not real liberals.
1258060	1263160	The issue is that classical liberal principles, from which our modern liberal values are descended
1263160	1265240	from, have an inherent weakness within them.
1265240	1267600	And I say that as a fellow liberal.
1267600	1269640	Here's a picture I've used several times in this channel.
1269640	1273780	It's got a man strapped into a pleasure pod, watching porn through a VR headset, having
1273780	1277720	a machine suck him off constantly, with heroin being injected into his veins.
1277720	1280460	We all look at this scene and feel like something's wrong here.
1280460	1282160	But what's the liberal's objection to it?
1282160	1285600	The person in this picture isn't lacking for liberty, equality, or fraternity.
1285600	1289520	Or to use a more modern framework, his consent isn't being violated, he has equality before
1289520	1293320	the law, the right to private property, he has freedoms at the wazoo, quite literally,
1293320	1295660	and yet it still seems wrong, doesn't it?
1295660	1299420	How can we object to what's going on in this picture from within liberalism?
1299420	1301240	It seems like we can't.
1301240	1303420	And yet, the picture still feels wrong.
1303420	1307700	As for James Lindsay, he seems to be motivated by an emotional desire to completely sever
1307700	1312140	socialism from liberalism, to declare that there is no genealogy that can be traced between
1312140	1313140	them.
1313140	1314140	But there is.
1314140	1317780	Marx wrote in response to Locke and Rousseau, to Hegel and Smith, and to many others.
1317780	1321980	Gramsci wrote in response to Marx, and his ideas formed Western Marxism, from the Frankfurt
1321980	1325020	school to the civil rights movement to modern diversity initiatives.
1325020	1329380	Alternatively, George Sorel also wrote in response to Marx, and Mussolini wrote in response
1329380	1330780	to Sorel.
1330780	1333780	Liberalism isn't isolated from other political philosophies, because that's just not how
1333780	1334780	this works.
1334780	1338540	And though liberals tend to hate socialists, even if they are sometimes suckered in by
1338540	1342380	them, socialists view themselves as inheritors of the liberal project.
1342380	1346220	In fact, there's a fair bit of evidence that political theorists don't develop new
1346220	1350740	political theories that are then afterward implemented, but rather they attempt to codify
1350740	1352640	what's already happening around them.
1352640	1356220	From John Locke and the Enlightenment, to Marx and the French Revolution, to Mussolini,
1356220	1358360	and what Mussolini was literally doing himself.
1358360	1362220	This is the reason, by the way, that the true reactionaries, not the people that leftoids
1362220	1366760	cry about on Twitter, but people who actually believe in the philosophy of reaction, they
1366760	1372600	consider liberalism, socialism, and fascism to all be different strains of modernism,
1372600	1377240	all the progeny of the Enlightenment, and that our society can only be saved by rejecting
1377240	1379200	them all and returning to monarchy.
1379760	1384880	It is that rejection of the entire Enlightenment by the reactionaries that Sargon is kind of
1384880	1388720	talking about in his articles on the false assumptions of liberalism.
1388720	1393040	All of our modern political philosophy rests on top of those false assumptions.
1393040	1398680	Liberalism's radical deformations into socialism and fascism over long stretches of time, as
1398680	1402120	these ideas have been passed down through different movements and writers, they do in
1402120	1407200	fact stem back from those false assumptions, as the writings of Locke and Rousseau form
1407200	1411880	the foundation for what we now know as human rights, which is prime for socialist subversion
1411880	1413560	due to the false assumptions.
1413560	1418480	The socialist, by the way, has his own language for these false assumptions, he calls them
1418480	1423460	the contradictions of capitalism, but even though he claims to resolve those contradictions,
1423460	1427360	he never does, he only exacerbates them, but that's a topic for another time.
1427360	1429620	So what's the solution to all this?
1429620	1433680	Is it to reject the entire Enlightenment and return to tradition, as the reactionaries
1433680	1434680	want?
1434680	1435680	I personally don't think so.
1435680	1437840	Why is she like the modern world, with all of its flaws?
1437840	1442140	I think the answer is found in that question I asked a long time ago, why do we have human
1442140	1443140	rights?
1443140	1448060	The second answer was, because they are descended from and justified by the man-in-the-state-of-nature
1448060	1451120	thought experiment that Locke and Rousseau engaged in.
1451120	1452980	That answer ended up being pretty flawed.
1452980	1456080	But the first answer, which we put aside, we'll now return to.
1456080	1460160	That answer was, because having them produces good results, that it's better to have them
1460160	1461760	than not have them.
1461760	1464240	That's true, but it's very arbitrary, isn't it?
1464240	1466520	It's not really convincing, at least on paper.
1466520	1469920	When you see the fruits of it in the real world, when you go outside and see the practical
1469920	1473600	reality you live in, assuming that you're a Westerner listening to this, then the question
1473600	1477860	of why should we have human rights seems absurd on the face of it.
1477860	1478860	Look at what we have.
1478860	1480280	Look at what it's given us.
1480280	1484280	The phrase, because it works, is the ultimate arbitrary answer.
1484280	1486360	It adheres to no political philosophy.
1486360	1491220	It defies the predicted outcomes of many failed political theories, socialism and fascism
1491220	1493260	and libertarianism and a hundred others.
1493300	1496480	Though for all of them, it's often worded as, because it doesn't work.
1496480	1501740	It makes people who like theories and explanations, who need intellectual answers to the problems,
1501740	1503220	feel very unsatisfied.
1503220	1504740	And yet, it's rock solid.
1504740	1508940	The fact that liberal societies just function better than the alternatives by any real-world
1508940	1513180	metric is evidence enough that the liberals of old, despite their faulty assumptions,
1513180	1517300	still managed to unearth some deep truths about how things should be run.
1517300	1521200	Or alternatively, they documented what they saw around them as working and not working,
1521200	1524400	and then discussed them accordingly, since like I said, theories don't create themselves
1524400	1525400	in a vacuum.
1525400	1529880	And this is why Sargon is no longer a liberal but a conservative, and why the type of liberal
1529880	1532760	that I am is strongly influenced by conservatism.
1532760	1534040	A liberal conservative.
1534040	1539520	Because, in the absence of a correct philosophical foundation upon which liberal values can rest,
1539520	1541240	we only have two options.
1541240	1546160	One is that liberalism continues to try and square that circle, implement those promises,
1546160	1550460	leaving it open to subversion by socialists who speak the same promises but simply promise
1550460	1551460	more of them.
1551460	1554540	Two is that liberalism adopts a different foundation.
1554540	1557660	And there is one out there that conservatives are already quite comfortable with, and that
1557660	1559700	some liberals have already begun to use.
1559700	1561740	The foundation of traditionalism.
1561740	1565340	There's a reason that some liberal thinkers describe it as the liberal tradition, after
1565340	1566340	all.
1566340	1567700	Didn't you guys ever wonder about that?
1567700	1571840	Conservative writer Edmund Burke famously wrote that instead of casting away all of
1571840	1575700	our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable degree.
1575700	1579780	And to take more shame on ourselves, we cherish them because they are prejudices.
1579820	1582940	And the longer they've lasted, and the more generally they've prevailed, the more we
1582940	1583980	cherish them.
1583980	1588840	We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason because
1588840	1593500	we suspect that the stock in each man is small, and that individuals would do better to avail
1593500	1597940	themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.
1597940	1602620	Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their
1602620	1606200	sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them.
1606200	1610060	If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue
1610060	1614640	the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice and to
1614640	1616780	leave nothing but the naked reason.
1616780	1620720	Because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and
1620720	1622740	an affection which will give it permanence.
1622740	1626920	What Burke is saying here is basically that tradition is the inherited wisdom of all the
1626920	1631040	millions of humans who came before you, each of them more or less as smart as you are,
1631040	1634760	and that they all figured out a bunch of shit that worked well enough to be passed on.
1634760	1638920	Your traditions have survived the crucible of time, so you should at least consider them
1638920	1642720	before deciding to toss them to the wind simply because they're old and you think you know
1642720	1643720	better.
1643720	1644720	G.K.
1644720	1647800	Chesterton came up with a similar idea in a more modern form, the thought experiment
1647800	1649380	of Chesterton's fence.
1649380	1654120	He wrote, There exists in such a case a certain institution or law, let us say for the sake
1654120	1657620	of simplicity, a fence or a gate erected across a road.
1657620	1661400	The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don't see the use of
1661400	1662400	this.
1662400	1663400	Let's clear it away.
1663400	1665960	The intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer.
1665960	1669520	If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away.
1669520	1670520	Go away and think.
1670520	1674520	Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you
1674520	1675640	to destroy it.
1675640	1679180	The point here is that you shouldn't change things until you understand why they are as
1679180	1680180	they are.
1680180	1684800	Because sometimes things are as they are for a good reason that you and all of your stupidity
1684800	1689640	and arrogance and bias can't actually see, and therefore you incorrectly assume it has
1689640	1690760	no purpose.
1690760	1695040	Chesterton and Burke were both conservatives but not reactionaries as far as I can tell.
1695040	1697240	They weren't against the Enlightenment project.
1697240	1702080	They advocated for restraint in the face of progress but not stagnation, careful thought,
1702080	1706360	practicality over theory, consideration of possible alternatives and downstream effects
1706360	1708120	before you make a change.
1708120	1711220	Not no change and not change for change's sake.
1711220	1715620	This is the golden mean, the eye of the needle that liberalism now needs to thread.
1715620	1720680	Critiques of pure reason without real-world experience are what socialism employs to undermine
1720680	1723120	liberalism through its own values.
1723120	1727960	But conservatism's combination of what Burke called reason and prejudice can serve to ground
1727960	1729920	liberalism in practicality.
1729920	1733960	In other words, we should be deferent to liberal values because they've worked for a long while
1733960	1734960	now.
1734960	1735960	The proof is in the pudding.
1735960	1739800	Changing those liberal values shouldn't be done as a part of a moral arc of history,
1739800	1744980	a march of progress, towards the next ideology, but instead as a practical consideration.
1744980	1748480	If socialism wants to call itself the next stage of progress, the liberals should nonetheless
1748480	1750680	examine their proposals with a keen eye.
1750680	1755720	And if those proposals are lacking, they should be rejected, even if that means, quote-unquote,
1755720	1757260	rejecting progress.
1757260	1761440	Because the goal isn't actually progress, it's keeping things on an even keel.
1761440	1765200	Yeah, I took that last bit from their conservative political philosopher, Michael Oakeshott,
1765200	1766200	this time.
1766200	1769920	In political activity, men sail a boundless and bottomless sea.
1769920	1774160	There is neither harbor for shelter nor floor for anchorage, neither starting place nor
1774160	1775600	appointed destination.
1775600	1778120	The enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel.
1778120	1779680	Like, guys, listen to that.
1779680	1782120	Is that not the best way to describe the proper running of a government?
1782120	1785760	It's not about progress for the sake of progress, and stability is a virtue that progressives
1785760	1787120	just seem to reject.
1787120	1791720	I generally don't like conservative politicians, especially in America, but conservative philosophers
1791720	1796600	are top tier, and they provide the best philosophical bulwark for liberals against the left.
1796600	1797600	And you know what?
1797600	1800600	The most successful liberal project, the United States of America?
1800600	1802200	The Founding Fathers knew all this stuff too.
1802200	1804840	What are the first words in the American Constitution?
1804840	1809120	We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice,
1809120	1812920	ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare,
1812920	1816740	and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish
1816740	1819320	this Constitution for the United States of America.
1819320	1822880	The Founding Fathers were certainly educated in the ideas of Locke and Rousseau.
1822880	1827240	In fact, America's first great political rivalry, Jefferson versus Adams, was essentially
1827240	1829640	Lockean liberalism versus Rousseauian.
1829640	1833360	But nonetheless, America was not born out of the state of nature, and the Founding Fathers
1833360	1834360	knew it.
1834880	1839080	In other words, we the people refer not to a nation that is to be created by the Constitution,
1839080	1843240	but a population of people that had already come to see itself as an interconnected group,
1843240	1847120	that already had in place a civil society ready for nationhood.
1847120	1849840	Remember, theory comes after political action, not before.
1849840	1854460	It's the traditions the first Americans inherited that served as the foundation for American
1854460	1855460	liberalism.
1855460	1859200	And when conservatives point out that the problems of modern American liberalism stem
1859200	1863160	from the fact that there is no longer a united culture or a fellowship or a language or a
1863160	1867800	religion or a philosophy or something that keeps all Americans together as Americans,
1867800	1869740	they've got a good point.
1869740	1872720	Liberalism is a good philosophy, but it's an incomplete one.
1872720	1874200	By design, in fact.
1874200	1877260	The whole point of it is that there should be a private sphere in which the government
1877260	1878440	has no say.
1878440	1883480	But the downside is that if there is no unifying civil force that keeps the population together,
1883480	1888040	liberal values are rapidly weaponized by people within the society that no longer see their
1888040	1889560	neighbor as their neighbor.
1889560	1894040	And liberal politics are slowly undermined by subversives who promise liberalism plus
1894040	1895720	but never actually deliver it.
1895720	1899160	And the reason they're successful is because without conservatism, liberalism's already
1899160	1902160	lost its best feedback mechanism.
1902160	1905960	Conservatism is the other half of the equation here, the yin to liberalism's yang.
1905960	1910080	That's why, even as I personally like a lot of liberal values and want to see many
1910080	1913440	liberal policies implemented, I am a conservative liberal.
1913440	1915120	Or a liberal conservative, whatever.
1915120	1919680	This is the stuff that James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose, for all of their other work, just
1919680	1921440	don't understand about this topic.
1921440	1924360	They don't know the philosophy, they don't have to know it either.
1924360	1928160	They can promote liberal values without the philosophy, but it has to sit on top of something
1928160	1932980	else in order for it to be stable and functional and not subverted by socialists.
1932980	1936000	Liberalism doesn't work without something from the outside holding it all together.
1936000	1940100	Right here at the end of the video, let's refer back to that kum pod picture from before.
1940100	1941960	How would liberalism address this?
1941960	1944600	Does this man need more freedom or more equality?
1944600	1946120	Does he need more rights?
1946120	1947820	Will that make the situation better?
1947820	1951880	Or do we need to step outside of the liberal frame to be able to properly critique what's
1951880	1952880	happening here?
1952880	1957760	The kum pod is where socialism is leading liberalism, using its own values, and liberalism
1957760	1959560	has no critique against it.
1959560	1963320	But conservatism, this is where the objection to the kum pod lies.
1963320	1967240	And to rewind this all the way back to the beginning, when Andrew Wilko asks in reference
1967240	1971880	to the all-female, all-black cockpit pilots, can't we just hire the best person for the
1971880	1972880	job?
1972880	1977020	There is a statement that must also come from outside of liberalism, at least partially.
1977020	1981720	The freedom, the equality, the human rights of liberalism have no objection to the all-female,
1981720	1986120	all-black cockpit pilots, because these pilots are now more equal with their peers.
1986120	1989000	They're now more liberated from their social conditions.
1989000	1994280	The appeal to meritocracy requires that a culture of meritocracy exists to appeal to,
1994280	1999280	which is something that can be fostered by conservatism and its focus on hard work, dedication,
1999280	2002960	and order, which are great counterbalances to the liberals' freedom, equality, and
2002960	2004760	rights when those things go too far.
2004760	2007840	The two sets of ideas need each other, guys, it's as simple as that.
2007840	2010920	Conservatism without liberalism is religious fear and stagnation.
2010920	2012960	Liberalism without conservatism is the kum pod.
2012960	2018360	This video describes all that stuff that James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose just don't get
2018360	2019760	about this topic.
2019760	2024200	And to be honest, if I were them, I would be a little bit embarrassed that two high-profile
2024200	2028840	public intellectuals had to be told this shit by an obese internet nerd named Short
2028840	2029560	Fat Otaku.
