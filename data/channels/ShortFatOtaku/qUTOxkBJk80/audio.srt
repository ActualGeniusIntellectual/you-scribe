1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
This is a topic I've spoken about before on this channel, and other channels, with

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,560
Sargon with Adam and Sitch.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,280
But the idea is kicking off again on social media, and I think I'm now a bit more equipped

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,120
to do it justice, so let's give it a go.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,480
This all started with the recent glut of articles proclaiming the end of the all-male, all-white

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,720
cockpit.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,880
Some airplane crews are now all-women, or all-black, or all-black women.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,880
And this is cause for celebration.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,960
Where non-white, non-males are being included in the airline industry.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,840
Right now, trolls are reposting these triumphant articles, alongside the couple of stories

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,020
coming out recently, where planes are malfunctioning mid-flight.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,760
Which is a pretty good joke, I gotta admit.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,320
But the general normie reply to the celebration of the end of the all-white, all-male cockpit

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,360
is best exemplified by Andrew Wilko's simple take, can't we just hire the best person

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
for the job?

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,740
And I personally agree, that was the point of the whole content of their character and

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,660
not the color of their skin thing.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,140
But today's racial activists have largely forgotten that liberalism means color blindness,

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,360
not racial privilege.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,180
Aaron McIntyre replied with, no, civil rights law has made that illegal.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,820
Diversity, equity, inclusion isn't some crazy form of communism, though its proponents

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,820
are often neo-Marxists.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,680
DEI is the natural evolution of civil rights law, that is why it was able to take hold

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
so easily.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,860
And until you are willing to unwind that leviathan, this is the world you'll live in.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,280
Tim Poole chimed in with a simple, yep, and James Lindsay replied with a simple, nope,

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,280
agreeing with a commenter that Tim Poole is big wrong and DEI is 100% communism, not liberalism.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Sargon then jumped in, saying communism isn't separate from liberalism.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,260
James Lindsay replied with, your opinion sucks lol.

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,840
Sargon simply said, it seems to be correct, though.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,120
Lindsay remarked, to who, simpletons?

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,600
Sargon said, to the people who understand the genealogy and purpose of these philosophies.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,200
Lindsay simply said, lol ok, with Sargon agreeing it's a hard pill to swallow.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,360
Lindsay then retorted with, it's just wrong, rejecting the offer to talk to Sargon about

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,480
the topic, or any other topic, saying he doesn't respect him.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,920
Sargon's final reply before James Lindsay blocked him was, that's a shame, James,

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
because between us I'm the one who actually understands liberalism and why it's brought

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
us to the position that we're in.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,680
You are far too emotionally committed to see the woods for the trees, and are being incredibly

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,640
rude to defend your lack of knowledge.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,640
Yeah, James was kinda rude in this exchange, not gonna lie.

42
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,880
He is pretty knowledgeable on some things, though.

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,640
I know he has no idea who I am, but I bet if he watched my video on Antonio Gramsci,

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,140
he would probably agree with it.

45
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,320
He said similar things in the topic himself, tracing the genealogy of modern-day diversity

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,240
movements back through the civil rights movement, which was mentored in critical theory by the

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,060
Frankfurt School, who brought the philosophy to America from the leftist intellectual scene

48
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,220
in Europe, where it was first conceptualized as Western Marxism in order to distinguish

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,820
it from Eastern Soviet Marxism, all stemming from the Italian socialist Antonio Gramsci,

50
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,900
who was active in the socialist movement from the 1910s until he was imprisoned by Mussolini.

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,820
I go into detail on all of these events in my Gramsci video, and it's also stuff that

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,920
Lindsay's spoken about publicly as well.

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,060
He knows that there's a traceable lineage from Gramsci's ideas to modern-day racial

54
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,420
activism, and therefore liberalism, being a different philosophy than socialism and

55
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,780
quite opposed to it, should also reject modern-day racial activism for being anti-liberal and

56
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,460
socialist in disguise.

57
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,120
However, Sargon is making the claim that there is a similar traceable lineage from liberalism

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,540
to socialism, and that despite the liberal world's great successes, the philosophy

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,580
of liberalism contains within it key flaws that have been carried forward through that

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,860
lineage into socialism, where they are now causing problems for us today.

61
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,540
And although James Lindsay never properly engages with the idea in the tweet thread,

62
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,500
simply brushing Sargon off instead, if you examined the writings of liberals, just as

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,860
you'd examined the writings of Antonio Gramsci or the Frankfurt School or the civil

64
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,180
rights activists, you'd realize that Sargon's actually got a point.

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,340
And no, it's not because he's my friend, let me explain how.

66
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,340
Helen Pluckrose, the co-author of James Lindsay's book, Cynical Theories, which is about postmodernism

67
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,180
and ideological bias in academia, also jumped into the conversation.

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,460
James Lindsay and I disagree on many things, but Carl's thoughts on liberalism being

69
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,620
uninformed and not worth respecting are not among them.

70
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,520
I can't do anything with liberalism is communism, just like I can't do anything with fish

71
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
or birds.

72
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,040
A definitional error is the only explanation.

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,960
She later expanded, if Sargon means that both liberalism and communism are the products

74
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,800
of humans, and this is just trivially true, I must assume it means more.

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,380
I'm going on what it says here.

76
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,840
And then she links Sargon's article, The Five False Assumptions of Liberalism.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,720
There's no error here on Sargon's part, though.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
It's an understanding of liberal philosophy and its shortcomings, hence the title of the

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
article.

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,920
When people say liberal today, if they're not Americans who just mean the left, they're

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,120
referring to the philosophy of liberalism and the political institutions that have been

82
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,760
based on it, which I would say is pretty accurately defined in Wikipedia.

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,080
Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on the rights of the individual, liberty,

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,360
consent of the governed, political equality, right to private property, and equality before

85
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,440
the law.

86
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,840
Liberals expose various views depending on their understanding of these principles, but

87
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,040
generally support private property, market economies, individual rights, including civil

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,280
rights and human rights, liberal democracy, secularism, rule of law, economic and political

89
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,200
freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion,

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,240
constitutional government, and privacy rights.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,240
As a liberal myself, that sounds pretty accurate to what I believe.

92
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,320
But most liberals in the modern day don't ask themselves why they believe it.

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,960
The answer is because they were raised in it, and liberalism is so successful that it's

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
simply become the norm.

95
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,320
It's the dominant ideology of the modern era, and as such, it doesn't really need

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,040
to justify its existence anymore.

97
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,480
It simply is.

98
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,440
What Sargon is asking of James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose is to justify liberalism's

99
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,520
existence, beyond the obvious answer of, it won, which to be fair, it did.

100
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,100
But what is the underpinning, what does it rest on?

101
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,960
That is where their conversation broke down.

102
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,880
So, let's examine what liberalism rests on.

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,340
Thomas Hobbes' most famous quote from Leviathan is often misattributed to him describing life

104
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,760
in a democracy as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

105
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,520
That's not the real context of the quote.

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,460
Here's the whole thing so you can understand it.

107
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,520
As long as men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in the condition

108
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,640
known as war, and it is a war of every man against every man.

109
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,700
What constitutes war is not actual fighting, but a known disposition to fight during a

110
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,720
time when there is no assurance to the contrary.

111
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,240
All other time is peace.

112
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,480
Therefore, whatever results from a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man,

113
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,760
also results from a time when men live with no other security but what their own strength

114
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,480
and ingenuity provides them with.

115
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,040
In such conditions, there is no place for hard work, because there is no assurance that

116
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,780
will yield results, and consequently no cultivation of the earth, no navigation or use of materials

117
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,500
that can be imported by sea, no construction of large buildings, no machines for moving

118
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,820
things that require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time,

119
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,820
no practical skills, no literature or scholarship, no society, and worst of all, continual fear

120
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,820
and danger of violent death and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

121
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,180
What Hobbes is saying here is that in the absence of an overarching authority, whether

122
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,780
that be a strong king from his time or a modern government, humans living in a state of anarchy

123
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,020
is the same as humans living in a state of perpetual warfare, where nobody builds anything

124
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,420
or invests for the future because there's no guarantee it won't simply be taken from

125
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,860
you by somebody else.

126
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,060
But if there's an authority that all the people submit to, then there is at least a

127
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,940
standard of law and an understanding of kinship as fellow subjects of the authority, and this

128
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,180
provides the stability necessary for society to flourish.

129
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,820
John Locke, considered to be the first liberal, wrote that in a state of nature, a time in

130
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,700
human prehistory before the first governments appeared, some humans would indeed live, as

131
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,940
Hobbes described, brutes locked in eternal warfare without an authority to unite them.

132
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,220
But Locke insisted that other humans would live by what he dubbed the law of reason,

133
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,520
where rational people would voluntarily choose to not harm each other or their possessions,

134
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,340
knowing it would bring retaliation.

135
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,700
For Locke, a society completely comprised of rational humans didn't need the overarching

136
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,140
authority of a government, as reason would provide the social balance.

137
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,900
But the brutes still exist, acting irrationally and disrupting the balance, and so reasonable

138
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,000
people enter into a voluntary contract with each other to form a government to protect

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
against the brutes.

140
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,440
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, considered to be the other first liberal, pushed this idea of the

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,040
state of nature to its extreme.

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,180
It was his belief that humans simply acted as solitary animals, wandering, eating, hunting,

143
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,880
and sleeping as they liked.

144
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,740
Because nature provided for all of his wants, he would have no reason to fight other humans,

145
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,640
and he would generally be disinterested in other people should they cross paths.

146
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Men and women would occasionally meet up to reproduce, after which the man would go off

147
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,440
on his own way, and the woman would care for the children until they were old enough

148
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,920
to go off on their own.

149
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Living separately, humans would not know envy or distrust for each other, and neither property

150
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,440
nor conflict would exist.

151
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,880
Rousseau believed that prehistoric humans existed as isolated individuals with little

152
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,240
differences between them, just as a lot of animals do.

153
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
What he describes is, in fact, how bears in Canada and the Northern United States actually

154
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,080
live, as isolated individuals keeping to themselves, spending their days hunting and foraging,

155
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,560
only coming together to mate.

156
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,440
Other bears, though they're famous for how protective they are of their offspring,

157
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,560
are also known to attack their own offspring to run them off after they're old enough

158
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,140
to go off on their own, as a way of her returning to her isolation.

159
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,960
And you thought your parents were rough on you after graduation.

160
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,520
When it comes to that humanity-in-the-state-of-nature thought experiment, these three philosophers

161
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,920
— Rousseau, Locke, and Hobbes — exist on a spectrum of idealization, with Rousseau

162
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,760
believing the state of nature was ideal, Hobbes believing it was terrible, and Locke taking

163
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,020
a middle-road approach.

164
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,840
But with modern archaeology, we understand now that Rousseau and Locke's views were

165
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,100
not true.

166
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,500
Human prehistory never contained a period of isolated individualism, nor did it contain

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,880
humans who lived by the Law of Reason.

168
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,060
We now know that humans lived in tribes, which were bound together by sentiment, custom,

169
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
and culture.

170
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,020
That the justification for those tribes' existence rested in spiritual tradition, family

171
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,300
lineages, and success in war.

172
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,980
And that these were not people of reason and enlightenment, but of superstition and authority.

173
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,880
In other words, Hobbes was correct.

174
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,040
There was no pre-social human.

175
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,160
Humans have always been social beings.

176
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,600
Now you might ask, as Helen Pluckrose did, who cares about this, Dev?

177
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
It doesn't matter if old liberal philosophers were wrong about humans in the state of nature.

178
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,000
What does that have to do with the practical, on-the-ground liberalism of today?

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,780
Well, the issue is that list of liberal values — the one that I pulled off Wikipedia — their

180
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,160
foundation rests in this thought experiment.

181
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,120
Again, let me show you how.

182
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
A common liberal value is equality.

183
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,920
I don't mean socialistic equality of outcomes — everyone owns things in common, equality

184
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
— but we will discuss that a little bit later.

185
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,760
I mean liberal equality, which primarily concerns itself with social inequality.

186
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,880
A liberal in medieval Europe might look at the social structure of feudalism and proclaim

187
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,620
that inequality of rank is a social ill, that a different standard of law is applied based

188
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,240
on one social class, and that this state of affairs is immoral.

189
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,760
Rousseau argued that if social inequality is a consequence of society itself, social

190
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,360
inequality would not be an issue in the state of nature.

191
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,000
To him, social inequality was the imposition of society, and humanity's natural state

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,320
was equality.

193
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,680
For Locke, he called this state of humanity the tabula rasa, which is Latin for scraped

194
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
tablet.

195
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,640
Locke was referring to wax tablets that Romans would use for temporary writing.

196
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,080
They would write on the wax with a stylus, and then once they no longer needed the writing,

197
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,680
a spatula affixed to the other end of the stylus would be used to scrape the wax, flattening

198
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,100
its down to its original form, so that it may be written on once again.

199
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,840
Locke used the scraped tablet example as a metaphor of the human mind, that the individual

200
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,440
is born a blank wax slate, and it is their society and experiences that write the content

201
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,640
of their character into the wax.

202
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Locke would use this metaphor to describe what liberals call nowadays the universal

203
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
man.

204
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,600
In modern parlance, if you've ever heard somebody say that if, using the hand of God,

205
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,080
you arbitrarily plucked somebody from society A and placed them into a family in society

206
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,560
B, that person would grow up to be a true member of society B, despite their genetic

207
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
difference.

208
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
They're appealing to Locke's tabula rasa idea.

209
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,600
In other words, the modern blank slate theory that socialists, progressive activists, and

210
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,240
postmodern scholars lean on when they say that everything is a social construct, and

211
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,720
we should engineer society to create the proper types of people, what they're leaning on

212
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,120
is a classically liberal idea.

213
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,780
Locke's tabula rasa and Rousseau's critique of social inequality are both built on the

214
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,100
assumption that once you peel away all the layers of a human, like an onion, what's

215
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,680
left at the center is some equal, interchangeable humanness, and that we know this is the case

216
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,900
because it existed in the state of nature.

217
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,480
But again, the state of nature is false.

218
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,460
As we continue to examine those liberal values, we can see that they all have their origins

219
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,140
in the debate between Locke, Rousseau, and Hobbes, and that the liberals were generally

220
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
wrong about it.

221
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,940
Let's take another liberal value, freedom.

222
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,820
Rousseau famously wrote that man is born free and everywhere else he is in chains.

223
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,880
This again stems from the state of nature, where the isolated individual is free in nature

224
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,660
to do as he likes, and it's society that chains him.

225
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,280
But again, due to archaeology, we know that tribal structures were anything but free.

226
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,920
For Locke, because all people were equal due to the blank slate, any differences between

227
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,180
people were products of society.

228
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,640
Freedom was therefore required because social constructions, like for example class differences,

229
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,060
were not a justification for one person to infringe upon another.

230
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,700
This comes together in what liberals tend to call the social contract, where the roaming

231
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,540
savage voluntarily exits the state of nature and submits himself to a higher authority

232
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,340
in exchange for that authority's protection and the safety of society.

233
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,940
Of course, if you were to ask a social contract liberal, what happens if I don't consent

234
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,940
to the contract?

235
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,980
What happens if I want to alter it?

236
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,240
How can I withdraw from it?

237
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,760
They will generally say that your participation in society and you enjoying its fruits is

238
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,960
your consent to the contract, and that if you truly want to withdraw from it, you must

239
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,360
withdraw from civilization and return to being Locke's roaming savage, Rousseau's

240
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,760
isolated individual, because civilization and all of its fruits are products of the

241
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,080
social contract.

242
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,780
Of course, libertarians are often the first ones to agree to that bargain, smugly pointing

243
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,080
out that almost all land on earth is now under somebody's jurisdiction, and so there is

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,540
no place to withdraw to, and that even if large swaths of people reject the social contract,

245
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,320
which has happened before, the state and its enforcement arm nonetheless continue to exist.

246
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
And what about rights?

247
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,200
There are many rights that liberals enjoy, and they have been very good for their societies

248
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
and the people living in them.

249
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
But what's their source?

250
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,120
In Locke's view, the law of reason we spoke about earlier was a component of natural law.

251
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,540
Natural law is a system of law based on a close observation of human nature, and based

252
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,380
on values intrinsic to human nature that can be deduced and applied independently of positive

253
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,680
law, that is, the enacted laws of a state or a society.

254
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,780
According to this view, all people have inherent rights, conferred not by an act of legislation

255
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,000
of a government, but by God, nature, or reason.

256
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,020
At least this is what Wikipedia says again, and again it's pretty accurate.

257
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,740
To put it in modern terms, we can observe human psychology and see how humans ideally

258
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,520
behave, and then our actual governments should construct their on-paper laws to adhere as

259
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,260
closely to that behavior as possible.

260
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,660
This is why, for the modern liberal, they often say law should be downstream from culture,

261
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,180
and that the state should only intervene to protect people's rights, not to itself infringe

262
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,720
upon them with its own moral standard separate from the people's.

263
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,400
The fascists derisively called the state of affairs the Night Watchman state, which

264
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,100
is a term that liberals eventually took for themselves as a self-descriptor of their ideal

265
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
government.

266
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,220
For Locke, humans had natural rights which were derived from natural law, but also that

267
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,180
humans voluntarily gave up those rights in exchange for civil rights upon leaving the

268
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,660
state of nature and joining civilization.

269
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,420
In his Second Treatise, he wrote, Men, when they enter into society, give up the equality,

270
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,520
liberty and executive power they had in the state of nature, into the hands of the society,

271
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,340
to be so far disposed of by the legislative, as the good of society shall require.

272
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,400
Rousseau believed much the same thing.

273
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,620
The total alienation of each associate, together with all of his rights to the whole community,

274
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,420
when the prince says to him, it is expedient for the state that you should die, he ought

275
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,620
to die, because it is only on that condition that he has been living in security up to

276
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,220
the present, and because his life is no longer a mere bounty of nature, but a gift made conditionally

277
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,220
by the state.

278
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
Here's a quick recap before we go any further.

279
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,660
I'm personally a liberal.

280
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,860
I like the civilization liberalism has built.

281
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,540
But the concept of human rights, which we simply accept as true and good without any

282
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,820
critical thought, because one, that's the society we were born into, and two, our society's

283
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,180
incredible success, this idea has gone unexamined by most modern liberals.

284
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,080
And once we examine the concept of human rights, we must understand it sits atop a very shaky

285
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,780
philosophical foundation.

286
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,860
Why do we have human rights?

287
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,220
There's two answers to that question.

288
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,820
The first one is because having them produces good results, that it's better to have them

289
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
than not, and therefore we should.

290
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,180
That is true, but let's set that answer aside for a moment, we'll return to it later.

291
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,340
The second answer is because modern human rights and the older civil rights that they

292
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,680
superseded, they were both derived from natural rights, that we observed human nature, discovered

293
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,700
natural law, and strive to create societies in harmony with that law as best we can.

294
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,340
And what is that natural law that we have derived those modern human rights from?

295
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,920
The blank slate of Locke and the isolated individual of Rousseau.

296
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,780
The moral underpinnings of all of this really does all stem from man in the state of nature.

297
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,500
Let's bring it back around to the discussion between Sargon and James Lindsay and Helen

298
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Pluckrose.

299
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,300
Sargon expanded on that initial statement that got Lindsay so angry, communism isn't

300
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,580
separate from liberalism.

301
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,620
It frames itself as a critique and postulates a solution.

302
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,700
It is clearly an ideological descendant of liberalism.

303
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,980
Now personally, I think the statement, communism is an ideological descendant of liberalism,

304
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,840
is significantly more accurate than communism isn't separate from liberalism.

305
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,260
Communism is separate from liberalism, in the same way that you are separate from your

306
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,260
great-grandfather.

307
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,620
But I get the point that he's making, and you know what?

308
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,180
So do the communists.

309
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:38,520
In 2014, the socialist rag Jacobin published Liberalism's Crisis, Socialism's Promise,

310
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,020
with the tagline of socialism isn't the negation of liberalism, it's the realization

311
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,380
of liberal values made impossible by capitalism.

312
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,180
This sentiment is echoed everywhere, and you can see it with a quick search online

313
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,060
of the phrase, promises of liberalism.

314
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,820
Here's what's meant by this.

315
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,820
The three core philosophical values of liberalism, from which everything else stems, are liberty,

316
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,060
equality, and fraternity.

317
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,200
They're so iconic, they're actually the motto of many liberal countries, most notably

318
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,500
the French Republic.

319
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,040
The socialist point of view is that liberalism has failed to uphold these three promises,

320
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,260
and that socialism is not the enemy of liberalism, but simply its next phase.

321
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,300
Here's how a socialist would view this conversation.

322
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Liberty?

323
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,860
The liberal might promise you political liberty, bourgeois liberty, but it's of limited use

324
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,940
if you're still subject to the whims of a dictator in the workplace.

325
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,000
The socialist, therefore, offers more liberty, not just political liberty, but economic liberty,

326
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,980
by democratizing not only the government, but private enterprise.

327
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Equality?

328
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,720
What equality can liberalism offer you if the class divide still exists?

329
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,100
The bourgeois still receive preferential treatment not only from civil society, but even in application

330
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
of the law.

331
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,940
The socialist offers true equality through the abolishment of the bourgeois.

332
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,060
Fraternity?

333
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,260
What fraternity is there when people are divided by class?

334
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,920
Solidarity is the true fraternity.

335
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,900
The total collectivization of all property and wealth will mean that the fraternity of

336
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,120
all of humanity will thrive.

337
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,140
This is how many socialists view socialism's relationship with liberalism, including Karl

338
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,420
Marx, who famously critiqued the liberal conception of human rights in his essay on the Jewish

339
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,460
Question, declaring that they didn't go far enough, that the liberal was too concerned

340
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,760
with property rights for any of his other values to ever be fulfilled.

341
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,900
For Marx, communism was the ultimate fulfillment of the liberal values of liberty, equality,

342
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
and fraternity.

343
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,460
A stateless, moneyless, classless society would theoretically have maximum liberty.

344
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,260
Nobody would ever be coerced to work ever again.

345
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
Maximum equality.

346
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,840
No social classes would ever again exist.

347
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Maximum fraternity.

348
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,860
All of humanity living in collective kinship.

349
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,440
Sometimes you get random retards like Oliver here, who will say something like, communists

350
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,580
have always viewed liberalism as their enemy, they are diametrically opposed ideologies.

351
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,800
The Cold War ended with liberalism winning over communism.

352
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
This guy really needs to stay in his lane.

353
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,920
It's true that the Cold War was all about one power bloc building a liberal world order,

354
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,960
triumphing over a second power bloc building a socialist world order, which would theoretically

355
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,020
become communism after its completion.

356
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,400
But this isn't a discussion of real politics.

357
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,520
Philosophically, the communists do oppose liberalism, but not because they view liberalism

358
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
as an enemy.

359
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,160
They simply view liberalism as outdated, needing replacement.

360
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Now the same is not true the other way around.

361
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,640
Liberals absolutely view communists as the enemy.

362
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,800
But think of it like this.

363
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,760
If computer programs could talk, for example, and one version of an application was going

364
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,960
to be replaced by version 2, would version 1 view version 2 as an enemy?

365
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Of course it would.

366
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,560
Would version 2 view version 1 as an enemy?

367
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Not at all.

368
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,960
They'd simply see their replacement as the natural course of progress.

369
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,720
That is how a socialist views liberalism.

370
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,280
Helen Pluckrose actually responded to all of this, stating that she wasn't familiar

371
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
with liberal philosophers.

372
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,180
And then she proceeded to make Sargon's own arguments about the flaws of liberalism back

373
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
to him.

374
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,840
I am frankly not surprised that she deactivated her account for a couple of days after that.

375
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,560
I don't know if you're watching this video, Helen, I hope you are.

376
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,060
The issue isn't that millions, followers of John Stuart Mill, are not real liberals.

377
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,160
The issue is that classical liberal principles, from which our modern liberal values are descended

378
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,240
from, have an inherent weakness within them.

379
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,600
And I say that as a fellow liberal.

380
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,640
Here's a picture I've used several times in this channel.

381
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,780
It's got a man strapped into a pleasure pod, watching porn through a VR headset, having

382
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,720
a machine suck him off constantly, with heroin being injected into his veins.

383
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,460
We all look at this scene and feel like something's wrong here.

384
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,160
But what's the liberal's objection to it?

385
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,600
The person in this picture isn't lacking for liberty, equality, or fraternity.

386
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,520
Or to use a more modern framework, his consent isn't being violated, he has equality before

387
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,320
the law, the right to private property, he has freedoms at the wazoo, quite literally,

388
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,660
and yet it still seems wrong, doesn't it?

389
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,420
How can we object to what's going on in this picture from within liberalism?

390
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,240
It seems like we can't.

391
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,420
And yet, the picture still feels wrong.

392
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,700
As for James Lindsay, he seems to be motivated by an emotional desire to completely sever

393
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,140
socialism from liberalism, to declare that there is no genealogy that can be traced between

394
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,140
them.

395
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,140
But there is.

396
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,780
Marx wrote in response to Locke and Rousseau, to Hegel and Smith, and to many others.

397
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,980
Gramsci wrote in response to Marx, and his ideas formed Western Marxism, from the Frankfurt

398
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,020
school to the civil rights movement to modern diversity initiatives.

399
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,380
Alternatively, George Sorel also wrote in response to Marx, and Mussolini wrote in response

400
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,780
to Sorel.

401
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Liberalism isn't isolated from other political philosophies, because that's just not how

402
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
this works.

403
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,540
And though liberals tend to hate socialists, even if they are sometimes suckered in by

404
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,380
them, socialists view themselves as inheritors of the liberal project.

405
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,220
In fact, there's a fair bit of evidence that political theorists don't develop new

406
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,740
political theories that are then afterward implemented, but rather they attempt to codify

407
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,640
what's already happening around them.

408
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,220
From John Locke and the Enlightenment, to Marx and the French Revolution, to Mussolini,

409
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,360
and what Mussolini was literally doing himself.

410
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,220
This is the reason, by the way, that the true reactionaries, not the people that leftoids

411
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,760
cry about on Twitter, but people who actually believe in the philosophy of reaction, they

412
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,600
consider liberalism, socialism, and fascism to all be different strains of modernism,

413
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,240
all the progeny of the Enlightenment, and that our society can only be saved by rejecting

414
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,200
them all and returning to monarchy.

415
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,880
It is that rejection of the entire Enlightenment by the reactionaries that Sargon is kind of

416
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,720
talking about in his articles on the false assumptions of liberalism.

417
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,040
All of our modern political philosophy rests on top of those false assumptions.

418
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,680
Liberalism's radical deformations into socialism and fascism over long stretches of time, as

419
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,120
these ideas have been passed down through different movements and writers, they do in

420
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,200
fact stem back from those false assumptions, as the writings of Locke and Rousseau form

421
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,880
the foundation for what we now know as human rights, which is prime for socialist subversion

422
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,560
due to the false assumptions.

423
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,480
The socialist, by the way, has his own language for these false assumptions, he calls them

424
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,460
the contradictions of capitalism, but even though he claims to resolve those contradictions,

425
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,360
he never does, he only exacerbates them, but that's a topic for another time.

426
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,620
So what's the solution to all this?

427
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,680
Is it to reject the entire Enlightenment and return to tradition, as the reactionaries

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
want?

429
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
I personally don't think so.

430
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,840
Why is she like the modern world, with all of its flaws?

431
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,140
I think the answer is found in that question I asked a long time ago, why do we have human

432
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
rights?

433
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,060
The second answer was, because they are descended from and justified by the man-in-the-state-of-nature

434
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,120
thought experiment that Locke and Rousseau engaged in.

435
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,980
That answer ended up being pretty flawed.

436
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,080
But the first answer, which we put aside, we'll now return to.

437
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,160
That answer was, because having them produces good results, that it's better to have them

438
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,760
than not have them.

439
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,240
That's true, but it's very arbitrary, isn't it?

440
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,520
It's not really convincing, at least on paper.

441
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,920
When you see the fruits of it in the real world, when you go outside and see the practical

442
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,600
reality you live in, assuming that you're a Westerner listening to this, then the question

443
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,860
of why should we have human rights seems absurd on the face of it.

444
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
Look at what we have.

445
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,280
Look at what it's given us.

446
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,280
The phrase, because it works, is the ultimate arbitrary answer.

447
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,360
It adheres to no political philosophy.

448
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,220
It defies the predicted outcomes of many failed political theories, socialism and fascism

449
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,260
and libertarianism and a hundred others.

450
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,480
Though for all of them, it's often worded as, because it doesn't work.

451
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,740
It makes people who like theories and explanations, who need intellectual answers to the problems,

452
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,220
feel very unsatisfied.

453
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,740
And yet, it's rock solid.

454
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,940
The fact that liberal societies just function better than the alternatives by any real-world

455
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,180
metric is evidence enough that the liberals of old, despite their faulty assumptions,

456
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,300
still managed to unearth some deep truths about how things should be run.

457
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,200
Or alternatively, they documented what they saw around them as working and not working,

458
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,400
and then discussed them accordingly, since like I said, theories don't create themselves

459
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
in a vacuum.

460
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,880
And this is why Sargon is no longer a liberal but a conservative, and why the type of liberal

461
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,760
that I am is strongly influenced by conservatism.

462
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,040
A liberal conservative.

463
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,520
Because, in the absence of a correct philosophical foundation upon which liberal values can rest,

464
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,240
we only have two options.

465
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,160
One is that liberalism continues to try and square that circle, implement those promises,

466
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,460
leaving it open to subversion by socialists who speak the same promises but simply promise

467
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
more of them.

468
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,540
Two is that liberalism adopts a different foundation.

469
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,660
And there is one out there that conservatives are already quite comfortable with, and that

470
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,700
some liberals have already begun to use.

471
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,740
The foundation of traditionalism.

472
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,340
There's a reason that some liberal thinkers describe it as the liberal tradition, after

473
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,340
all.

474
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,700
Didn't you guys ever wonder about that?

475
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,840
Conservative writer Edmund Burke famously wrote that instead of casting away all of

476
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,700
our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable degree.

477
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,780
And to take more shame on ourselves, we cherish them because they are prejudices.

478
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,940
And the longer they've lasted, and the more generally they've prevailed, the more we

479
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,980
cherish them.

480
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,840
We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason because

481
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,500
we suspect that the stock in each man is small, and that individuals would do better to avail

482
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,940
themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.

483
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,620
Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their

484
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,200
sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them.

485
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,060
If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue

486
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,640
the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice and to

487
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,780
leave nothing but the naked reason.

488
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,720
Because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and

489
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,740
an affection which will give it permanence.

490
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,920
What Burke is saying here is basically that tradition is the inherited wisdom of all the

491
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,040
millions of humans who came before you, each of them more or less as smart as you are,

492
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,760
and that they all figured out a bunch of shit that worked well enough to be passed on.

493
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,920
Your traditions have survived the crucible of time, so you should at least consider them

494
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,720
before deciding to toss them to the wind simply because they're old and you think you know

495
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
better.

496
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
G.K.

497
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,800
Chesterton came up with a similar idea in a more modern form, the thought experiment

498
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,380
of Chesterton's fence.

499
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,120
He wrote, There exists in such a case a certain institution or law, let us say for the sake

500
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,620
of simplicity, a fence or a gate erected across a road.

501
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,400
The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don't see the use of

502
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
this.

503
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Let's clear it away.

504
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,960
The intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer.

505
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,520
If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away.

506
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Go away and think.

507
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you

508
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,640
to destroy it.

509
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,180
The point here is that you shouldn't change things until you understand why they are as

510
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
they are.

511
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,800
Because sometimes things are as they are for a good reason that you and all of your stupidity

512
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,640
and arrogance and bias can't actually see, and therefore you incorrectly assume it has

513
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,760
no purpose.

514
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,040
Chesterton and Burke were both conservatives but not reactionaries as far as I can tell.

515
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,240
They weren't against the Enlightenment project.

516
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,080
They advocated for restraint in the face of progress but not stagnation, careful thought,

517
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,360
practicality over theory, consideration of possible alternatives and downstream effects

518
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,120
before you make a change.

519
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,220
Not no change and not change for change's sake.

520
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,620
This is the golden mean, the eye of the needle that liberalism now needs to thread.

521
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,680
Critiques of pure reason without real-world experience are what socialism employs to undermine

522
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,120
liberalism through its own values.

523
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,960
But conservatism's combination of what Burke called reason and prejudice can serve to ground

524
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,920
liberalism in practicality.

525
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,960
In other words, we should be deferent to liberal values because they've worked for a long while

526
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
now.

527
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
The proof is in the pudding.

528
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,800
Changing those liberal values shouldn't be done as a part of a moral arc of history,

529
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,980
a march of progress, towards the next ideology, but instead as a practical consideration.

530
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,480
If socialism wants to call itself the next stage of progress, the liberals should nonetheless

531
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,680
examine their proposals with a keen eye.

532
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,720
And if those proposals are lacking, they should be rejected, even if that means, quote-unquote,

533
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,260
rejecting progress.

534
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,440
Because the goal isn't actually progress, it's keeping things on an even keel.

535
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,200
Yeah, I took that last bit from their conservative political philosopher, Michael Oakeshott,

536
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
this time.

537
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,920
In political activity, men sail a boundless and bottomless sea.

538
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,160
There is neither harbor for shelter nor floor for anchorage, neither starting place nor

539
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,600
appointed destination.

540
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,120
The enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel.

541
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
Like, guys, listen to that.

542
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,120
Is that not the best way to describe the proper running of a government?

543
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,760
It's not about progress for the sake of progress, and stability is a virtue that progressives

544
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
just seem to reject.

545
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,720
I generally don't like conservative politicians, especially in America, but conservative philosophers

546
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,600
are top tier, and they provide the best philosophical bulwark for liberals against the left.

547
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
And you know what?

548
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,600
The most successful liberal project, the United States of America?

549
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,200
The Founding Fathers knew all this stuff too.

550
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,840
What are the first words in the American Constitution?

551
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,120
We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice,

552
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,920
ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare,

553
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,740
and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish

554
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,320
this Constitution for the United States of America.

555
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,880
The Founding Fathers were certainly educated in the ideas of Locke and Rousseau.

556
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,240
In fact, America's first great political rivalry, Jefferson versus Adams, was essentially

557
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,640
Lockean liberalism versus Rousseauian.

558
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,360
But nonetheless, America was not born out of the state of nature, and the Founding Fathers

559
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
knew it.

560
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,080
In other words, we the people refer not to a nation that is to be created by the Constitution,

561
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,240
but a population of people that had already come to see itself as an interconnected group,

562
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,120
that already had in place a civil society ready for nationhood.

563
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,840
Remember, theory comes after political action, not before.

564
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,460
It's the traditions the first Americans inherited that served as the foundation for American

565
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
liberalism.

566
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,200
And when conservatives point out that the problems of modern American liberalism stem

567
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,160
from the fact that there is no longer a united culture or a fellowship or a language or a

568
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,800
religion or a philosophy or something that keeps all Americans together as Americans,

569
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,740
they've got a good point.

570
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,720
Liberalism is a good philosophy, but it's an incomplete one.

571
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,200
By design, in fact.

572
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,260
The whole point of it is that there should be a private sphere in which the government

573
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,440
has no say.

574
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,480
But the downside is that if there is no unifying civil force that keeps the population together,

575
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,040
liberal values are rapidly weaponized by people within the society that no longer see their

576
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,560
neighbor as their neighbor.

577
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,040
And liberal politics are slowly undermined by subversives who promise liberalism plus

578
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,720
but never actually deliver it.

579
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,160
And the reason they're successful is because without conservatism, liberalism's already

580
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,160
lost its best feedback mechanism.

581
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,960
Conservatism is the other half of the equation here, the yin to liberalism's yang.

582
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,080
That's why, even as I personally like a lot of liberal values and want to see many

583
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,440
liberal policies implemented, I am a conservative liberal.

584
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
Or a liberal conservative, whatever.

585
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,680
This is the stuff that James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose, for all of their other work, just

586
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,440
don't understand about this topic.

587
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,360
They don't know the philosophy, they don't have to know it either.

588
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,160
They can promote liberal values without the philosophy, but it has to sit on top of something

589
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,980
else in order for it to be stable and functional and not subverted by socialists.

590
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,000
Liberalism doesn't work without something from the outside holding it all together.

591
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,100
Right here at the end of the video, let's refer back to that kum pod picture from before.

592
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,960
How would liberalism address this?

593
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,600
Does this man need more freedom or more equality?

594
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,120
Does he need more rights?

595
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,820
Will that make the situation better?

596
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,880
Or do we need to step outside of the liberal frame to be able to properly critique what's

597
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
happening here?

598
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,760
The kum pod is where socialism is leading liberalism, using its own values, and liberalism

599
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,560
has no critique against it.

600
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,320
But conservatism, this is where the objection to the kum pod lies.

601
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,240
And to rewind this all the way back to the beginning, when Andrew Wilko asks in reference

602
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,880
to the all-female, all-black cockpit pilots, can't we just hire the best person for the

603
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
job?

604
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,020
There is a statement that must also come from outside of liberalism, at least partially.

605
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,720
The freedom, the equality, the human rights of liberalism have no objection to the all-female,

606
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,120
all-black cockpit pilots, because these pilots are now more equal with their peers.

607
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,000
They're now more liberated from their social conditions.

608
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,280
The appeal to meritocracy requires that a culture of meritocracy exists to appeal to,

609
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,280
which is something that can be fostered by conservatism and its focus on hard work, dedication,

610
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,960
and order, which are great counterbalances to the liberals' freedom, equality, and

611
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,760
rights when those things go too far.

612
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,840
The two sets of ideas need each other, guys, it's as simple as that.

613
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,920
Conservatism without liberalism is religious fear and stagnation.

614
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,960
Liberalism without conservatism is the kum pod.

615
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,360
This video describes all that stuff that James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose just don't get

616
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,760
about this topic.

617
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,200
And to be honest, if I were them, I would be a little bit embarrassed that two high-profile

618
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,840
public intellectuals had to be told this shit by an obese internet nerd named Short

619
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,560
Fat Otaku.
