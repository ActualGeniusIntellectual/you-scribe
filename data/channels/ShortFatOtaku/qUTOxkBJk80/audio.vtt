00:00.000 --> 00:09.080
This is a topic I've spoken about before on this channel, and other channels, with

00:09.080 --> 00:10.560
Sargon with Adam and Sitch.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.280
But the idea is kicking off again on social media, and I think I'm now a bit more equipped

00:14.280 --> 00:16.120
to do it justice, so let's give it a go.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.480
This all started with the recent glut of articles proclaiming the end of the all-male, all-white

00:20.480 --> 00:21.720
cockpit.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.880
Some airplane crews are now all-women, or all-black, or all-black women.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.880
And this is cause for celebration.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.960
Where non-white, non-males are being included in the airline industry.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.840
Right now, trolls are reposting these triumphant articles, alongside the couple of stories

00:35.840 --> 00:39.020
coming out recently, where planes are malfunctioning mid-flight.

00:39.020 --> 00:40.760
Which is a pretty good joke, I gotta admit.

00:40.760 --> 00:45.320
But the general normie reply to the celebration of the end of the all-white, all-male cockpit

00:45.320 --> 00:50.360
is best exemplified by Andrew Wilko's simple take, can't we just hire the best person

00:50.360 --> 00:51.360
for the job?

00:51.360 --> 00:55.740
And I personally agree, that was the point of the whole content of their character and

00:55.740 --> 00:57.660
not the color of their skin thing.

00:57.660 --> 01:02.140
But today's racial activists have largely forgotten that liberalism means color blindness,

01:02.140 --> 01:03.360
not racial privilege.

01:03.360 --> 01:08.180
Aaron McIntyre replied with, no, civil rights law has made that illegal.

01:08.180 --> 01:12.820
Diversity, equity, inclusion isn't some crazy form of communism, though its proponents

01:12.820 --> 01:13.820
are often neo-Marxists.

01:13.820 --> 01:18.680
DEI is the natural evolution of civil rights law, that is why it was able to take hold

01:18.680 --> 01:19.680
so easily.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.860
And until you are willing to unwind that leviathan, this is the world you'll live in.

01:24.020 --> 01:28.280
Tim Poole chimed in with a simple, yep, and James Lindsay replied with a simple, nope,

01:28.280 --> 01:35.280
agreeing with a commenter that Tim Poole is big wrong and DEI is 100% communism, not liberalism.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.120
Sargon then jumped in, saying communism isn't separate from liberalism.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.260
James Lindsay replied with, your opinion sucks lol.

01:42.260 --> 01:44.840
Sargon simply said, it seems to be correct, though.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.120
Lindsay remarked, to who, simpletons?

01:47.120 --> 01:51.600
Sargon said, to the people who understand the genealogy and purpose of these philosophies.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.200
Lindsay simply said, lol ok, with Sargon agreeing it's a hard pill to swallow.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.360
Lindsay then retorted with, it's just wrong, rejecting the offer to talk to Sargon about

02:00.360 --> 02:03.480
the topic, or any other topic, saying he doesn't respect him.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.920
Sargon's final reply before James Lindsay blocked him was, that's a shame, James,

02:07.920 --> 02:11.840
because between us I'm the one who actually understands liberalism and why it's brought

02:11.840 --> 02:13.200
us to the position that we're in.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.680
You are far too emotionally committed to see the woods for the trees, and are being incredibly

02:17.680 --> 02:19.640
rude to defend your lack of knowledge.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.640
Yeah, James was kinda rude in this exchange, not gonna lie.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.880
He is pretty knowledgeable on some things, though.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.640
I know he has no idea who I am, but I bet if he watched my video on Antonio Gramsci,

02:28.640 --> 02:30.140
he would probably agree with it.

02:30.140 --> 02:34.320
He said similar things in the topic himself, tracing the genealogy of modern-day diversity

02:34.320 --> 02:38.240
movements back through the civil rights movement, which was mentored in critical theory by the

02:38.240 --> 02:42.060
Frankfurt School, who brought the philosophy to America from the leftist intellectual scene

02:42.060 --> 02:46.220
in Europe, where it was first conceptualized as Western Marxism in order to distinguish

02:46.220 --> 02:50.820
it from Eastern Soviet Marxism, all stemming from the Italian socialist Antonio Gramsci,

02:50.820 --> 02:54.900
who was active in the socialist movement from the 1910s until he was imprisoned by Mussolini.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.820
I go into detail on all of these events in my Gramsci video, and it's also stuff that

02:58.820 --> 03:00.920
Lindsay's spoken about publicly as well.

03:00.920 --> 03:05.060
He knows that there's a traceable lineage from Gramsci's ideas to modern-day racial

03:05.060 --> 03:09.420
activism, and therefore liberalism, being a different philosophy than socialism and

03:09.420 --> 03:14.780
quite opposed to it, should also reject modern-day racial activism for being anti-liberal and

03:14.780 --> 03:16.460
socialist in disguise.

03:16.460 --> 03:21.120
However, Sargon is making the claim that there is a similar traceable lineage from liberalism

03:21.120 --> 03:25.540
to socialism, and that despite the liberal world's great successes, the philosophy

03:25.540 --> 03:29.580
of liberalism contains within it key flaws that have been carried forward through that

03:29.580 --> 03:33.860
lineage into socialism, where they are now causing problems for us today.

03:33.860 --> 03:37.540
And although James Lindsay never properly engages with the idea in the tweet thread,

03:37.540 --> 03:41.500
simply brushing Sargon off instead, if you examined the writings of liberals, just as

03:41.500 --> 03:44.860
you'd examined the writings of Antonio Gramsci or the Frankfurt School or the civil

03:44.860 --> 03:48.180
rights activists, you'd realize that Sargon's actually got a point.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.340
And no, it's not because he's my friend, let me explain how.

03:51.340 --> 03:56.340
Helen Pluckrose, the co-author of James Lindsay's book, Cynical Theories, which is about postmodernism

03:56.340 --> 04:00.180
and ideological bias in academia, also jumped into the conversation.

04:00.180 --> 04:03.460
James Lindsay and I disagree on many things, but Carl's thoughts on liberalism being

04:03.460 --> 04:06.620
uninformed and not worth respecting are not among them.

04:06.620 --> 04:10.520
I can't do anything with liberalism is communism, just like I can't do anything with fish

04:10.540 --> 04:11.540
or birds.

04:11.540 --> 04:14.040
A definitional error is the only explanation.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.960
She later expanded, if Sargon means that both liberalism and communism are the products

04:17.960 --> 04:21.800
of humans, and this is just trivially true, I must assume it means more.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.380
I'm going on what it says here.

04:23.380 --> 04:26.840
And then she links Sargon's article, The Five False Assumptions of Liberalism.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.720
There's no error here on Sargon's part, though.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.240
It's an understanding of liberal philosophy and its shortcomings, hence the title of the

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
article.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.920
When people say liberal today, if they're not Americans who just mean the left, they're

04:36.920 --> 04:40.120
referring to the philosophy of liberalism and the political institutions that have been

04:40.120 --> 04:43.760
based on it, which I would say is pretty accurately defined in Wikipedia.

04:43.760 --> 04:48.080
Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on the rights of the individual, liberty,

04:48.080 --> 04:51.360
consent of the governed, political equality, right to private property, and equality before

04:51.360 --> 04:52.440
the law.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.840
Liberals expose various views depending on their understanding of these principles, but

04:55.840 --> 05:00.040
generally support private property, market economies, individual rights, including civil

05:00.040 --> 05:04.280
rights and human rights, liberal democracy, secularism, rule of law, economic and political

05:04.280 --> 05:08.200
freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion,

05:08.200 --> 05:10.240
constitutional government, and privacy rights.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.240
As a liberal myself, that sounds pretty accurate to what I believe.

05:13.240 --> 05:17.320
But most liberals in the modern day don't ask themselves why they believe it.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.960
The answer is because they were raised in it, and liberalism is so successful that it's

05:20.960 --> 05:21.960
simply become the norm.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.320
It's the dominant ideology of the modern era, and as such, it doesn't really need

05:25.320 --> 05:27.040
to justify its existence anymore.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.480
It simply is.

05:28.480 --> 05:33.440
What Sargon is asking of James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose is to justify liberalism's

05:33.440 --> 05:37.520
existence, beyond the obvious answer of, it won, which to be fair, it did.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.100
But what is the underpinning, what does it rest on?

05:40.100 --> 05:41.960
That is where their conversation broke down.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.880
So, let's examine what liberalism rests on.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.340
Thomas Hobbes' most famous quote from Leviathan is often misattributed to him describing life

05:49.340 --> 05:52.760
in a democracy as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.520
That's not the real context of the quote.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.460
Here's the whole thing so you can understand it.

05:56.460 --> 06:00.520
As long as men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in the condition

06:00.520 --> 06:04.640
known as war, and it is a war of every man against every man.

06:04.640 --> 06:08.700
What constitutes war is not actual fighting, but a known disposition to fight during a

06:08.700 --> 06:11.720
time when there is no assurance to the contrary.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.240
All other time is peace.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.480
Therefore, whatever results from a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man,

06:17.480 --> 06:21.760
also results from a time when men live with no other security but what their own strength

06:21.760 --> 06:23.480
and ingenuity provides them with.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.040
In such conditions, there is no place for hard work, because there is no assurance that

06:27.040 --> 06:31.780
will yield results, and consequently no cultivation of the earth, no navigation or use of materials

06:31.780 --> 06:35.500
that can be imported by sea, no construction of large buildings, no machines for moving

06:35.500 --> 06:39.820
things that require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time,

06:39.820 --> 06:44.820
no practical skills, no literature or scholarship, no society, and worst of all, continual fear

06:44.820 --> 06:50.820
and danger of violent death and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

06:50.820 --> 06:54.180
What Hobbes is saying here is that in the absence of an overarching authority, whether

06:54.180 --> 06:58.780
that be a strong king from his time or a modern government, humans living in a state of anarchy

06:58.780 --> 07:03.020
is the same as humans living in a state of perpetual warfare, where nobody builds anything

07:03.020 --> 07:06.420
or invests for the future because there's no guarantee it won't simply be taken from

07:06.420 --> 07:07.860
you by somebody else.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.060
But if there's an authority that all the people submit to, then there is at least a

07:11.060 --> 07:15.940
standard of law and an understanding of kinship as fellow subjects of the authority, and this

07:15.940 --> 07:19.180
provides the stability necessary for society to flourish.

07:19.180 --> 07:23.820
John Locke, considered to be the first liberal, wrote that in a state of nature, a time in

07:23.820 --> 07:27.700
human prehistory before the first governments appeared, some humans would indeed live, as

07:27.700 --> 07:31.940
Hobbes described, brutes locked in eternal warfare without an authority to unite them.

07:31.940 --> 07:36.220
But Locke insisted that other humans would live by what he dubbed the law of reason,

07:36.220 --> 07:40.520
where rational people would voluntarily choose to not harm each other or their possessions,

07:40.520 --> 07:42.340
knowing it would bring retaliation.

07:42.340 --> 07:46.700
For Locke, a society completely comprised of rational humans didn't need the overarching

07:46.700 --> 07:50.140
authority of a government, as reason would provide the social balance.

07:50.140 --> 07:54.900
But the brutes still exist, acting irrationally and disrupting the balance, and so reasonable

07:54.900 --> 07:59.000
people enter into a voluntary contract with each other to form a government to protect

07:59.000 --> 08:00.120
against the brutes.

08:00.120 --> 08:04.440
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, considered to be the other first liberal, pushed this idea of the

08:04.440 --> 08:06.040
state of nature to its extreme.

08:06.040 --> 08:11.180
It was his belief that humans simply acted as solitary animals, wandering, eating, hunting,

08:11.180 --> 08:12.880
and sleeping as they liked.

08:12.880 --> 08:16.740
Because nature provided for all of his wants, he would have no reason to fight other humans,

08:16.740 --> 08:20.640
and he would generally be disinterested in other people should they cross paths.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.640
Men and women would occasionally meet up to reproduce, after which the man would go off

08:23.640 --> 08:26.440
on his own way, and the woman would care for the children until they were old enough

08:26.440 --> 08:27.920
to go off on their own.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.520
Living separately, humans would not know envy or distrust for each other, and neither property

08:32.520 --> 08:34.440
nor conflict would exist.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.880
Rousseau believed that prehistoric humans existed as isolated individuals with little

08:37.880 --> 08:40.240
differences between them, just as a lot of animals do.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.720
What he describes is, in fact, how bears in Canada and the Northern United States actually

08:44.720 --> 08:49.080
live, as isolated individuals keeping to themselves, spending their days hunting and foraging,

08:49.080 --> 08:50.560
only coming together to mate.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.440
Other bears, though they're famous for how protective they are of their offspring,

08:53.440 --> 08:57.560
are also known to attack their own offspring to run them off after they're old enough

08:57.560 --> 09:01.140
to go off on their own, as a way of her returning to her isolation.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.960
And you thought your parents were rough on you after graduation.

09:03.960 --> 09:08.520
When it comes to that humanity-in-the-state-of-nature thought experiment, these three philosophers

09:08.520 --> 09:12.920
— Rousseau, Locke, and Hobbes — exist on a spectrum of idealization, with Rousseau

09:12.920 --> 09:16.760
believing the state of nature was ideal, Hobbes believing it was terrible, and Locke taking

09:16.760 --> 09:18.020
a middle-road approach.

09:18.020 --> 09:21.840
But with modern archaeology, we understand now that Rousseau and Locke's views were

09:21.840 --> 09:23.100
not true.

09:23.100 --> 09:27.500
Human prehistory never contained a period of isolated individualism, nor did it contain

09:27.500 --> 09:29.880
humans who lived by the Law of Reason.

09:29.880 --> 09:34.060
We now know that humans lived in tribes, which were bound together by sentiment, custom,

09:34.060 --> 09:35.060
and culture.

09:35.060 --> 09:39.020
That the justification for those tribes' existence rested in spiritual tradition, family

09:39.020 --> 09:41.300
lineages, and success in war.

09:41.300 --> 09:45.980
And that these were not people of reason and enlightenment, but of superstition and authority.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.880
In other words, Hobbes was correct.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.040
There was no pre-social human.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.160
Humans have always been social beings.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.600
Now you might ask, as Helen Pluckrose did, who cares about this, Dev?

09:55.600 --> 09:59.600
It doesn't matter if old liberal philosophers were wrong about humans in the state of nature.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.000
What does that have to do with the practical, on-the-ground liberalism of today?

10:03.000 --> 10:07.780
Well, the issue is that list of liberal values — the one that I pulled off Wikipedia — their

10:07.780 --> 10:10.160
foundation rests in this thought experiment.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.120
Again, let me show you how.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.120
A common liberal value is equality.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.920
I don't mean socialistic equality of outcomes — everyone owns things in common, equality

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
— but we will discuss that a little bit later.

10:20.920 --> 10:25.760
I mean liberal equality, which primarily concerns itself with social inequality.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.880
A liberal in medieval Europe might look at the social structure of feudalism and proclaim

10:29.880 --> 10:34.620
that inequality of rank is a social ill, that a different standard of law is applied based

10:34.620 --> 10:38.240
on one social class, and that this state of affairs is immoral.

10:38.240 --> 10:42.760
Rousseau argued that if social inequality is a consequence of society itself, social

10:42.760 --> 10:46.360
inequality would not be an issue in the state of nature.

10:46.360 --> 10:51.000
To him, social inequality was the imposition of society, and humanity's natural state

10:51.000 --> 10:52.320
was equality.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.680
For Locke, he called this state of humanity the tabula rasa, which is Latin for scraped

10:56.680 --> 10:57.680
tablet.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.640
Locke was referring to wax tablets that Romans would use for temporary writing.

11:01.640 --> 11:05.080
They would write on the wax with a stylus, and then once they no longer needed the writing,

11:05.080 --> 11:09.680
a spatula affixed to the other end of the stylus would be used to scrape the wax, flattening

11:09.680 --> 11:13.100
its down to its original form, so that it may be written on once again.

11:13.100 --> 11:17.840
Locke used the scraped tablet example as a metaphor of the human mind, that the individual

11:17.840 --> 11:23.440
is born a blank wax slate, and it is their society and experiences that write the content

11:23.440 --> 11:25.640
of their character into the wax.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.640
Locke would use this metaphor to describe what liberals call nowadays the universal

11:29.640 --> 11:30.640
man.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.600
In modern parlance, if you've ever heard somebody say that if, using the hand of God,

11:34.600 --> 11:39.080
you arbitrarily plucked somebody from society A and placed them into a family in society

11:39.080 --> 11:43.560
B, that person would grow up to be a true member of society B, despite their genetic

11:43.560 --> 11:44.560
difference.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.040
They're appealing to Locke's tabula rasa idea.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.600
In other words, the modern blank slate theory that socialists, progressive activists, and

11:51.600 --> 11:56.240
postmodern scholars lean on when they say that everything is a social construct, and

11:56.240 --> 11:59.720
we should engineer society to create the proper types of people, what they're leaning on

11:59.720 --> 12:02.120
is a classically liberal idea.

12:02.120 --> 12:06.780
Locke's tabula rasa and Rousseau's critique of social inequality are both built on the

12:06.780 --> 12:11.100
assumption that once you peel away all the layers of a human, like an onion, what's

12:11.100 --> 12:16.680
left at the center is some equal, interchangeable humanness, and that we know this is the case

12:16.680 --> 12:18.900
because it existed in the state of nature.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.480
But again, the state of nature is false.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.460
As we continue to examine those liberal values, we can see that they all have their origins

12:24.460 --> 12:28.140
in the debate between Locke, Rousseau, and Hobbes, and that the liberals were generally

12:28.140 --> 12:29.140
wrong about it.

12:29.140 --> 12:31.940
Let's take another liberal value, freedom.

12:31.940 --> 12:36.820
Rousseau famously wrote that man is born free and everywhere else he is in chains.

12:36.820 --> 12:40.880
This again stems from the state of nature, where the isolated individual is free in nature

12:40.880 --> 12:43.660
to do as he likes, and it's society that chains him.

12:43.660 --> 12:47.280
But again, due to archaeology, we know that tribal structures were anything but free.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.920
For Locke, because all people were equal due to the blank slate, any differences between

12:50.920 --> 12:53.180
people were products of society.

12:53.180 --> 12:57.640
Freedom was therefore required because social constructions, like for example class differences,

12:57.640 --> 13:01.060
were not a justification for one person to infringe upon another.

13:01.060 --> 13:04.700
This comes together in what liberals tend to call the social contract, where the roaming

13:04.700 --> 13:09.540
savage voluntarily exits the state of nature and submits himself to a higher authority

13:09.540 --> 13:13.340
in exchange for that authority's protection and the safety of society.

13:13.340 --> 13:16.940
Of course, if you were to ask a social contract liberal, what happens if I don't consent

13:16.940 --> 13:17.940
to the contract?

13:17.940 --> 13:18.980
What happens if I want to alter it?

13:18.980 --> 13:20.240
How can I withdraw from it?

13:20.240 --> 13:24.760
They will generally say that your participation in society and you enjoying its fruits is

13:24.760 --> 13:28.960
your consent to the contract, and that if you truly want to withdraw from it, you must

13:28.960 --> 13:33.360
withdraw from civilization and return to being Locke's roaming savage, Rousseau's

13:33.360 --> 13:37.760
isolated individual, because civilization and all of its fruits are products of the

13:37.760 --> 13:39.080
social contract.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.780
Of course, libertarians are often the first ones to agree to that bargain, smugly pointing

13:42.780 --> 13:47.080
out that almost all land on earth is now under somebody's jurisdiction, and so there is

13:47.080 --> 13:52.540
no place to withdraw to, and that even if large swaths of people reject the social contract,

13:52.540 --> 13:57.320
which has happened before, the state and its enforcement arm nonetheless continue to exist.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.320
And what about rights?

13:58.480 --> 14:02.200
There are many rights that liberals enjoy, and they have been very good for their societies

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
and the people living in them.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.800
But what's their source?

14:04.800 --> 14:10.120
In Locke's view, the law of reason we spoke about earlier was a component of natural law.

14:10.120 --> 14:14.540
Natural law is a system of law based on a close observation of human nature, and based

14:14.540 --> 14:19.380
on values intrinsic to human nature that can be deduced and applied independently of positive

14:19.380 --> 14:22.680
law, that is, the enacted laws of a state or a society.

14:22.680 --> 14:27.780
According to this view, all people have inherent rights, conferred not by an act of legislation

14:27.780 --> 14:31.000
of a government, but by God, nature, or reason.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.020
At least this is what Wikipedia says again, and again it's pretty accurate.

14:34.020 --> 14:38.740
To put it in modern terms, we can observe human psychology and see how humans ideally

14:38.740 --> 14:43.520
behave, and then our actual governments should construct their on-paper laws to adhere as

14:43.520 --> 14:46.260
closely to that behavior as possible.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.660
This is why, for the modern liberal, they often say law should be downstream from culture,

14:50.660 --> 14:55.180
and that the state should only intervene to protect people's rights, not to itself infringe

14:55.180 --> 14:58.720
upon them with its own moral standard separate from the people's.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.400
The fascists derisively called the state of affairs the Night Watchman state, which

15:02.400 --> 15:07.100
is a term that liberals eventually took for themselves as a self-descriptor of their ideal

15:07.100 --> 15:08.100
government.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.220
For Locke, humans had natural rights which were derived from natural law, but also that

15:12.220 --> 15:16.180
humans voluntarily gave up those rights in exchange for civil rights upon leaving the

15:16.180 --> 15:18.660
state of nature and joining civilization.

15:18.660 --> 15:23.420
In his Second Treatise, he wrote, Men, when they enter into society, give up the equality,

15:23.420 --> 15:27.520
liberty and executive power they had in the state of nature, into the hands of the society,

15:27.520 --> 15:32.340
to be so far disposed of by the legislative, as the good of society shall require.

15:32.340 --> 15:34.400
Rousseau believed much the same thing.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.620
The total alienation of each associate, together with all of his rights to the whole community,

15:38.620 --> 15:42.420
when the prince says to him, it is expedient for the state that you should die, he ought

15:42.420 --> 15:46.620
to die, because it is only on that condition that he has been living in security up to

15:46.620 --> 15:52.220
the present, and because his life is no longer a mere bounty of nature, but a gift made conditionally

15:52.220 --> 15:53.220
by the state.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.220
Here's a quick recap before we go any further.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.660
I'm personally a liberal.

15:56.660 --> 15:58.860
I like the civilization liberalism has built.

15:58.860 --> 16:03.540
But the concept of human rights, which we simply accept as true and good without any

16:03.540 --> 16:07.820
critical thought, because one, that's the society we were born into, and two, our society's

16:07.820 --> 16:12.180
incredible success, this idea has gone unexamined by most modern liberals.

16:12.180 --> 16:17.080
And once we examine the concept of human rights, we must understand it sits atop a very shaky

16:17.080 --> 16:18.780
philosophical foundation.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.860
Why do we have human rights?

16:20.860 --> 16:22.220
There's two answers to that question.

16:22.220 --> 16:25.820
The first one is because having them produces good results, that it's better to have them

16:25.820 --> 16:27.820
than not, and therefore we should.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.180
That is true, but let's set that answer aside for a moment, we'll return to it later.

16:31.180 --> 16:35.340
The second answer is because modern human rights and the older civil rights that they

16:35.340 --> 16:40.680
superseded, they were both derived from natural rights, that we observed human nature, discovered

16:40.680 --> 16:45.700
natural law, and strive to create societies in harmony with that law as best we can.

16:45.700 --> 16:50.340
And what is that natural law that we have derived those modern human rights from?

16:50.340 --> 16:53.920
The blank slate of Locke and the isolated individual of Rousseau.

16:53.920 --> 16:58.780
The moral underpinnings of all of this really does all stem from man in the state of nature.

16:58.780 --> 17:02.500
Let's bring it back around to the discussion between Sargon and James Lindsay and Helen

17:02.500 --> 17:03.500
Pluckrose.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.300
Sargon expanded on that initial statement that got Lindsay so angry, communism isn't

17:07.300 --> 17:08.580
separate from liberalism.

17:08.580 --> 17:11.620
It frames itself as a critique and postulates a solution.

17:11.620 --> 17:14.700
It is clearly an ideological descendant of liberalism.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.980
Now personally, I think the statement, communism is an ideological descendant of liberalism,

17:18.980 --> 17:23.840
is significantly more accurate than communism isn't separate from liberalism.

17:23.840 --> 17:27.260
Communism is separate from liberalism, in the same way that you are separate from your

17:27.260 --> 17:28.260
great-grandfather.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.620
But I get the point that he's making, and you know what?

17:30.620 --> 17:32.180
So do the communists.

17:32.180 --> 17:38.520
In 2014, the socialist rag Jacobin published Liberalism's Crisis, Socialism's Promise,

17:38.520 --> 17:43.020
with the tagline of socialism isn't the negation of liberalism, it's the realization

17:43.020 --> 17:46.380
of liberal values made impossible by capitalism.

17:46.380 --> 17:50.180
This sentiment is echoed everywhere, and you can see it with a quick search online

17:50.180 --> 17:52.060
of the phrase, promises of liberalism.

17:52.060 --> 17:53.820
Here's what's meant by this.

17:53.820 --> 17:58.820
The three core philosophical values of liberalism, from which everything else stems, are liberty,

17:58.820 --> 18:00.060
equality, and fraternity.

18:00.060 --> 18:04.200
They're so iconic, they're actually the motto of many liberal countries, most notably

18:04.200 --> 18:05.500
the French Republic.

18:05.500 --> 18:10.040
The socialist point of view is that liberalism has failed to uphold these three promises,

18:10.040 --> 18:14.260
and that socialism is not the enemy of liberalism, but simply its next phase.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.300
Here's how a socialist would view this conversation.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.300
Liberty?

18:18.300 --> 18:22.860
The liberal might promise you political liberty, bourgeois liberty, but it's of limited use

18:22.860 --> 18:25.940
if you're still subject to the whims of a dictator in the workplace.

18:25.940 --> 18:31.000
The socialist, therefore, offers more liberty, not just political liberty, but economic liberty,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.980
by democratizing not only the government, but private enterprise.

18:33.980 --> 18:34.980
Equality?

18:34.980 --> 18:38.720
What equality can liberalism offer you if the class divide still exists?

18:38.720 --> 18:44.100
The bourgeois still receive preferential treatment not only from civil society, but even in application

18:44.100 --> 18:45.100
of the law.

18:45.100 --> 18:48.940
The socialist offers true equality through the abolishment of the bourgeois.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.060
Fraternity?

18:50.060 --> 18:53.260
What fraternity is there when people are divided by class?

18:53.260 --> 18:54.920
Solidarity is the true fraternity.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.900
The total collectivization of all property and wealth will mean that the fraternity of

18:58.900 --> 19:01.120
all of humanity will thrive.

19:01.120 --> 19:06.140
This is how many socialists view socialism's relationship with liberalism, including Karl

19:06.140 --> 19:10.420
Marx, who famously critiqued the liberal conception of human rights in his essay on the Jewish

19:10.420 --> 19:13.460
Question, declaring that they didn't go far enough, that the liberal was too concerned

19:13.460 --> 19:16.760
with property rights for any of his other values to ever be fulfilled.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.900
For Marx, communism was the ultimate fulfillment of the liberal values of liberty, equality,

19:21.900 --> 19:22.900
and fraternity.

19:22.900 --> 19:28.460
A stateless, moneyless, classless society would theoretically have maximum liberty.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.260
Nobody would ever be coerced to work ever again.

19:31.260 --> 19:32.260
Maximum equality.

19:32.260 --> 19:34.840
No social classes would ever again exist.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
Maximum fraternity.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.860
All of humanity living in collective kinship.

19:38.860 --> 19:42.440
Sometimes you get random retards like Oliver here, who will say something like, communists

19:42.440 --> 19:46.580
have always viewed liberalism as their enemy, they are diametrically opposed ideologies.

19:46.580 --> 19:49.800
The Cold War ended with liberalism winning over communism.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.600
This guy really needs to stay in his lane.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.920
It's true that the Cold War was all about one power bloc building a liberal world order,

19:55.920 --> 19:59.960
triumphing over a second power bloc building a socialist world order, which would theoretically

19:59.960 --> 20:02.020
become communism after its completion.

20:02.020 --> 20:04.400
But this isn't a discussion of real politics.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.520
Philosophically, the communists do oppose liberalism, but not because they view liberalism

20:08.520 --> 20:09.520
as an enemy.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.160
They simply view liberalism as outdated, needing replacement.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.160
Now the same is not true the other way around.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.640
Liberals absolutely view communists as the enemy.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.800
But think of it like this.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.760
If computer programs could talk, for example, and one version of an application was going

20:22.760 --> 20:26.960
to be replaced by version 2, would version 1 view version 2 as an enemy?

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
Of course it would.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.560
Would version 2 view version 1 as an enemy?

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
Not at all.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.960
They'd simply see their replacement as the natural course of progress.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.720
That is how a socialist views liberalism.

20:37.720 --> 20:41.280
Helen Pluckrose actually responded to all of this, stating that she wasn't familiar

20:41.280 --> 20:42.840
with liberal philosophers.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.180
And then she proceeded to make Sargon's own arguments about the flaws of liberalism back

20:46.180 --> 20:47.180
to him.

20:47.180 --> 20:50.840
I am frankly not surprised that she deactivated her account for a couple of days after that.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.560
I don't know if you're watching this video, Helen, I hope you are.

20:53.560 --> 20:58.060
The issue isn't that millions, followers of John Stuart Mill, are not real liberals.

20:58.060 --> 21:03.160
The issue is that classical liberal principles, from which our modern liberal values are descended

21:03.160 --> 21:05.240
from, have an inherent weakness within them.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.600
And I say that as a fellow liberal.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.640
Here's a picture I've used several times in this channel.

21:09.640 --> 21:13.780
It's got a man strapped into a pleasure pod, watching porn through a VR headset, having

21:13.780 --> 21:17.720
a machine suck him off constantly, with heroin being injected into his veins.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.460
We all look at this scene and feel like something's wrong here.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.160
But what's the liberal's objection to it?

21:22.160 --> 21:25.600
The person in this picture isn't lacking for liberty, equality, or fraternity.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.520
Or to use a more modern framework, his consent isn't being violated, he has equality before

21:29.520 --> 21:33.320
the law, the right to private property, he has freedoms at the wazoo, quite literally,

21:33.320 --> 21:35.660
and yet it still seems wrong, doesn't it?

21:35.660 --> 21:39.420
How can we object to what's going on in this picture from within liberalism?

21:39.420 --> 21:41.240
It seems like we can't.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.420
And yet, the picture still feels wrong.

21:43.420 --> 21:47.700
As for James Lindsay, he seems to be motivated by an emotional desire to completely sever

21:47.700 --> 21:52.140
socialism from liberalism, to declare that there is no genealogy that can be traced between

21:52.140 --> 21:53.140
them.

21:53.140 --> 21:54.140
But there is.

21:54.140 --> 21:57.780
Marx wrote in response to Locke and Rousseau, to Hegel and Smith, and to many others.

21:57.780 --> 22:01.980
Gramsci wrote in response to Marx, and his ideas formed Western Marxism, from the Frankfurt

22:01.980 --> 22:05.020
school to the civil rights movement to modern diversity initiatives.

22:05.020 --> 22:09.380
Alternatively, George Sorel also wrote in response to Marx, and Mussolini wrote in response

22:09.380 --> 22:10.780
to Sorel.

22:10.780 --> 22:13.780
Liberalism isn't isolated from other political philosophies, because that's just not how

22:13.780 --> 22:14.780
this works.

22:14.780 --> 22:18.540
And though liberals tend to hate socialists, even if they are sometimes suckered in by

22:18.540 --> 22:22.380
them, socialists view themselves as inheritors of the liberal project.

22:22.380 --> 22:26.220
In fact, there's a fair bit of evidence that political theorists don't develop new

22:26.220 --> 22:30.740
political theories that are then afterward implemented, but rather they attempt to codify

22:30.740 --> 22:32.640
what's already happening around them.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.220
From John Locke and the Enlightenment, to Marx and the French Revolution, to Mussolini,

22:36.220 --> 22:38.360
and what Mussolini was literally doing himself.

22:38.360 --> 22:42.220
This is the reason, by the way, that the true reactionaries, not the people that leftoids

22:42.220 --> 22:46.760
cry about on Twitter, but people who actually believe in the philosophy of reaction, they

22:46.760 --> 22:52.600
consider liberalism, socialism, and fascism to all be different strains of modernism,

22:52.600 --> 22:57.240
all the progeny of the Enlightenment, and that our society can only be saved by rejecting

22:57.240 --> 22:59.200
them all and returning to monarchy.

22:59.760 --> 23:04.880
It is that rejection of the entire Enlightenment by the reactionaries that Sargon is kind of

23:04.880 --> 23:08.720
talking about in his articles on the false assumptions of liberalism.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.040
All of our modern political philosophy rests on top of those false assumptions.

23:13.040 --> 23:18.680
Liberalism's radical deformations into socialism and fascism over long stretches of time, as

23:18.680 --> 23:22.120
these ideas have been passed down through different movements and writers, they do in

23:22.120 --> 23:27.200
fact stem back from those false assumptions, as the writings of Locke and Rousseau form

23:27.200 --> 23:31.880
the foundation for what we now know as human rights, which is prime for socialist subversion

23:31.880 --> 23:33.560
due to the false assumptions.

23:33.560 --> 23:38.480
The socialist, by the way, has his own language for these false assumptions, he calls them

23:38.480 --> 23:43.460
the contradictions of capitalism, but even though he claims to resolve those contradictions,

23:43.460 --> 23:47.360
he never does, he only exacerbates them, but that's a topic for another time.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.620
So what's the solution to all this?

23:49.620 --> 23:53.680
Is it to reject the entire Enlightenment and return to tradition, as the reactionaries

23:53.680 --> 23:54.680
want?

23:54.680 --> 23:55.680
I personally don't think so.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.840
Why is she like the modern world, with all of its flaws?

23:57.840 --> 24:02.140
I think the answer is found in that question I asked a long time ago, why do we have human

24:02.140 --> 24:03.140
rights?

24:03.140 --> 24:08.060
The second answer was, because they are descended from and justified by the man-in-the-state-of-nature

24:08.060 --> 24:11.120
thought experiment that Locke and Rousseau engaged in.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.980
That answer ended up being pretty flawed.

24:12.980 --> 24:16.080
But the first answer, which we put aside, we'll now return to.

24:16.080 --> 24:20.160
That answer was, because having them produces good results, that it's better to have them

24:20.160 --> 24:21.760
than not have them.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.240
That's true, but it's very arbitrary, isn't it?

24:24.240 --> 24:26.520
It's not really convincing, at least on paper.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.920
When you see the fruits of it in the real world, when you go outside and see the practical

24:29.920 --> 24:33.600
reality you live in, assuming that you're a Westerner listening to this, then the question

24:33.600 --> 24:37.860
of why should we have human rights seems absurd on the face of it.

24:37.860 --> 24:38.860
Look at what we have.

24:38.860 --> 24:40.280
Look at what it's given us.

24:40.280 --> 24:44.280
The phrase, because it works, is the ultimate arbitrary answer.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.360
It adheres to no political philosophy.

24:46.360 --> 24:51.220
It defies the predicted outcomes of many failed political theories, socialism and fascism

24:51.220 --> 24:53.260
and libertarianism and a hundred others.

24:53.300 --> 24:56.480
Though for all of them, it's often worded as, because it doesn't work.

24:56.480 --> 25:01.740
It makes people who like theories and explanations, who need intellectual answers to the problems,

25:01.740 --> 25:03.220
feel very unsatisfied.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.740
And yet, it's rock solid.

25:04.740 --> 25:08.940
The fact that liberal societies just function better than the alternatives by any real-world

25:08.940 --> 25:13.180
metric is evidence enough that the liberals of old, despite their faulty assumptions,

25:13.180 --> 25:17.300
still managed to unearth some deep truths about how things should be run.

25:17.300 --> 25:21.200
Or alternatively, they documented what they saw around them as working and not working,

25:21.200 --> 25:24.400
and then discussed them accordingly, since like I said, theories don't create themselves

25:24.400 --> 25:25.400
in a vacuum.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.880
And this is why Sargon is no longer a liberal but a conservative, and why the type of liberal

25:29.880 --> 25:32.760
that I am is strongly influenced by conservatism.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.040
A liberal conservative.

25:34.040 --> 25:39.520
Because, in the absence of a correct philosophical foundation upon which liberal values can rest,

25:39.520 --> 25:41.240
we only have two options.

25:41.240 --> 25:46.160
One is that liberalism continues to try and square that circle, implement those promises,

25:46.160 --> 25:50.460
leaving it open to subversion by socialists who speak the same promises but simply promise

25:50.460 --> 25:51.460
more of them.

25:51.460 --> 25:54.540
Two is that liberalism adopts a different foundation.

25:54.540 --> 25:57.660
And there is one out there that conservatives are already quite comfortable with, and that

25:57.660 --> 25:59.700
some liberals have already begun to use.

25:59.700 --> 26:01.740
The foundation of traditionalism.

26:01.740 --> 26:05.340
There's a reason that some liberal thinkers describe it as the liberal tradition, after

26:05.340 --> 26:06.340
all.

26:06.340 --> 26:07.700
Didn't you guys ever wonder about that?

26:07.700 --> 26:11.840
Conservative writer Edmund Burke famously wrote that instead of casting away all of

26:11.840 --> 26:15.700
our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable degree.

26:15.700 --> 26:19.780
And to take more shame on ourselves, we cherish them because they are prejudices.

26:19.820 --> 26:22.940
And the longer they've lasted, and the more generally they've prevailed, the more we

26:22.940 --> 26:23.980
cherish them.

26:23.980 --> 26:28.840
We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason because

26:28.840 --> 26:33.500
we suspect that the stock in each man is small, and that individuals would do better to avail

26:33.500 --> 26:37.940
themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.

26:37.940 --> 26:42.620
Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their

26:42.620 --> 26:46.200
sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them.

26:46.200 --> 26:50.060
If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue

26:50.060 --> 26:54.640
the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice and to

26:54.640 --> 26:56.780
leave nothing but the naked reason.

26:56.780 --> 27:00.720
Because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and

27:00.720 --> 27:02.740
an affection which will give it permanence.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.920
What Burke is saying here is basically that tradition is the inherited wisdom of all the

27:06.920 --> 27:11.040
millions of humans who came before you, each of them more or less as smart as you are,

27:11.040 --> 27:14.760
and that they all figured out a bunch of shit that worked well enough to be passed on.

27:14.760 --> 27:18.920
Your traditions have survived the crucible of time, so you should at least consider them

27:18.920 --> 27:22.720
before deciding to toss them to the wind simply because they're old and you think you know

27:22.720 --> 27:23.720
better.

27:23.720 --> 27:24.720
G.K.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.800
Chesterton came up with a similar idea in a more modern form, the thought experiment

27:27.800 --> 27:29.380
of Chesterton's fence.

27:29.380 --> 27:34.120
He wrote, There exists in such a case a certain institution or law, let us say for the sake

27:34.120 --> 27:37.620
of simplicity, a fence or a gate erected across a road.

27:37.620 --> 27:41.400
The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don't see the use of

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
this.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
Let's clear it away.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.960
The intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.520
If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.520
Go away and think.

27:50.520 --> 27:54.520
Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you

27:54.520 --> 27:55.640
to destroy it.

27:55.640 --> 27:59.180
The point here is that you shouldn't change things until you understand why they are as

27:59.180 --> 28:00.180
they are.

28:00.180 --> 28:04.800
Because sometimes things are as they are for a good reason that you and all of your stupidity

28:04.800 --> 28:09.640
and arrogance and bias can't actually see, and therefore you incorrectly assume it has

28:09.640 --> 28:10.760
no purpose.

28:10.760 --> 28:15.040
Chesterton and Burke were both conservatives but not reactionaries as far as I can tell.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.240
They weren't against the Enlightenment project.

28:17.240 --> 28:22.080
They advocated for restraint in the face of progress but not stagnation, careful thought,

28:22.080 --> 28:26.360
practicality over theory, consideration of possible alternatives and downstream effects

28:26.360 --> 28:28.120
before you make a change.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.220
Not no change and not change for change's sake.

28:31.220 --> 28:35.620
This is the golden mean, the eye of the needle that liberalism now needs to thread.

28:35.620 --> 28:40.680
Critiques of pure reason without real-world experience are what socialism employs to undermine

28:40.680 --> 28:43.120
liberalism through its own values.

28:43.120 --> 28:47.960
But conservatism's combination of what Burke called reason and prejudice can serve to ground

28:47.960 --> 28:49.920
liberalism in practicality.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.960
In other words, we should be deferent to liberal values because they've worked for a long while

28:53.960 --> 28:54.960
now.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.960
The proof is in the pudding.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.800
Changing those liberal values shouldn't be done as a part of a moral arc of history,

28:59.800 --> 29:04.980
a march of progress, towards the next ideology, but instead as a practical consideration.

29:04.980 --> 29:08.480
If socialism wants to call itself the next stage of progress, the liberals should nonetheless

29:08.480 --> 29:10.680
examine their proposals with a keen eye.

29:10.680 --> 29:15.720
And if those proposals are lacking, they should be rejected, even if that means, quote-unquote,

29:15.720 --> 29:17.260
rejecting progress.

29:17.260 --> 29:21.440
Because the goal isn't actually progress, it's keeping things on an even keel.

29:21.440 --> 29:25.200
Yeah, I took that last bit from their conservative political philosopher, Michael Oakeshott,

29:25.200 --> 29:26.200
this time.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.920
In political activity, men sail a boundless and bottomless sea.

29:29.920 --> 29:34.160
There is neither harbor for shelter nor floor for anchorage, neither starting place nor

29:34.160 --> 29:35.600
appointed destination.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.120
The enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.680
Like, guys, listen to that.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.120
Is that not the best way to describe the proper running of a government?

29:42.120 --> 29:45.760
It's not about progress for the sake of progress, and stability is a virtue that progressives

29:45.760 --> 29:47.120
just seem to reject.

29:47.120 --> 29:51.720
I generally don't like conservative politicians, especially in America, but conservative philosophers

29:51.720 --> 29:56.600
are top tier, and they provide the best philosophical bulwark for liberals against the left.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
And you know what?

29:57.600 --> 30:00.600
The most successful liberal project, the United States of America?

30:00.600 --> 30:02.200
The Founding Fathers knew all this stuff too.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.840
What are the first words in the American Constitution?

30:04.840 --> 30:09.120
We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice,

30:09.120 --> 30:12.920
ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare,

30:12.920 --> 30:16.740
and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish

30:16.740 --> 30:19.320
this Constitution for the United States of America.

30:19.320 --> 30:22.880
The Founding Fathers were certainly educated in the ideas of Locke and Rousseau.

30:22.880 --> 30:27.240
In fact, America's first great political rivalry, Jefferson versus Adams, was essentially

30:27.240 --> 30:29.640
Lockean liberalism versus Rousseauian.

30:29.640 --> 30:33.360
But nonetheless, America was not born out of the state of nature, and the Founding Fathers

30:33.360 --> 30:34.360
knew it.

30:34.880 --> 30:39.080
In other words, we the people refer not to a nation that is to be created by the Constitution,

30:39.080 --> 30:43.240
but a population of people that had already come to see itself as an interconnected group,

30:43.240 --> 30:47.120
that already had in place a civil society ready for nationhood.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.840
Remember, theory comes after political action, not before.

30:49.840 --> 30:54.460
It's the traditions the first Americans inherited that served as the foundation for American

30:54.460 --> 30:55.460
liberalism.

30:55.460 --> 30:59.200
And when conservatives point out that the problems of modern American liberalism stem

30:59.200 --> 31:03.160
from the fact that there is no longer a united culture or a fellowship or a language or a

31:03.160 --> 31:07.800
religion or a philosophy or something that keeps all Americans together as Americans,

31:07.800 --> 31:09.740
they've got a good point.

31:09.740 --> 31:12.720
Liberalism is a good philosophy, but it's an incomplete one.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.200
By design, in fact.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.260
The whole point of it is that there should be a private sphere in which the government

31:17.260 --> 31:18.440
has no say.

31:18.440 --> 31:23.480
But the downside is that if there is no unifying civil force that keeps the population together,

31:23.480 --> 31:28.040
liberal values are rapidly weaponized by people within the society that no longer see their

31:28.040 --> 31:29.560
neighbor as their neighbor.

31:29.560 --> 31:34.040
And liberal politics are slowly undermined by subversives who promise liberalism plus

31:34.040 --> 31:35.720
but never actually deliver it.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.160
And the reason they're successful is because without conservatism, liberalism's already

31:39.160 --> 31:42.160
lost its best feedback mechanism.

31:42.160 --> 31:45.960
Conservatism is the other half of the equation here, the yin to liberalism's yang.

31:45.960 --> 31:50.080
That's why, even as I personally like a lot of liberal values and want to see many

31:50.080 --> 31:53.440
liberal policies implemented, I am a conservative liberal.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.120
Or a liberal conservative, whatever.

31:55.120 --> 31:59.680
This is the stuff that James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose, for all of their other work, just

31:59.680 --> 32:01.440
don't understand about this topic.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.360
They don't know the philosophy, they don't have to know it either.

32:04.360 --> 32:08.160
They can promote liberal values without the philosophy, but it has to sit on top of something

32:08.160 --> 32:12.980
else in order for it to be stable and functional and not subverted by socialists.

32:12.980 --> 32:16.000
Liberalism doesn't work without something from the outside holding it all together.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.100
Right here at the end of the video, let's refer back to that kum pod picture from before.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.960
How would liberalism address this?

32:21.960 --> 32:24.600
Does this man need more freedom or more equality?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.120
Does he need more rights?

32:26.120 --> 32:27.820
Will that make the situation better?

32:27.820 --> 32:31.880
Or do we need to step outside of the liberal frame to be able to properly critique what's

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
happening here?

32:32.880 --> 32:37.760
The kum pod is where socialism is leading liberalism, using its own values, and liberalism

32:37.760 --> 32:39.560
has no critique against it.

32:39.560 --> 32:43.320
But conservatism, this is where the objection to the kum pod lies.

32:43.320 --> 32:47.240
And to rewind this all the way back to the beginning, when Andrew Wilko asks in reference

32:47.240 --> 32:51.880
to the all-female, all-black cockpit pilots, can't we just hire the best person for the

32:51.880 --> 32:52.880
job?

32:52.880 --> 32:57.020
There is a statement that must also come from outside of liberalism, at least partially.

32:57.020 --> 33:01.720
The freedom, the equality, the human rights of liberalism have no objection to the all-female,

33:01.720 --> 33:06.120
all-black cockpit pilots, because these pilots are now more equal with their peers.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.000
They're now more liberated from their social conditions.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.280
The appeal to meritocracy requires that a culture of meritocracy exists to appeal to,

33:14.280 --> 33:19.280
which is something that can be fostered by conservatism and its focus on hard work, dedication,

33:19.280 --> 33:22.960
and order, which are great counterbalances to the liberals' freedom, equality, and

33:22.960 --> 33:24.760
rights when those things go too far.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.840
The two sets of ideas need each other, guys, it's as simple as that.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.920
Conservatism without liberalism is religious fear and stagnation.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.960
Liberalism without conservatism is the kum pod.

33:32.960 --> 33:38.360
This video describes all that stuff that James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose just don't get

33:38.360 --> 33:39.760
about this topic.

33:39.760 --> 33:44.200
And to be honest, if I were them, I would be a little bit embarrassed that two high-profile

33:44.200 --> 33:48.840
public intellectuals had to be told this shit by an obese internet nerd named Short

33:48.840 --> 33:49.560
Fat Otaku.
