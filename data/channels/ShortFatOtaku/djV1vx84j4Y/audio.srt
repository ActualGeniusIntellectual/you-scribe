00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello my friends, this video is meant to announce that I have now uploaded the entire SFO backlog

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,440
on my rumble channel.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,400
That is rumble dot com slash short fat otaku.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,520
I know it says here it's like slash c slash c dash three five zero eight eight seven.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Yeah, okay.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,040
But if you just put in short fat otaku and hit enter, you'll get sent to the same place.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,560
So rumble dot com slash short fat otaku rumble is another up and coming alt tech platform

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,120
like odyssey and like bit shoot and I've spent maybe the past week and a half uploading my

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,280
around 500 videos to this platform.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,300
It does not have an auto sync feature the way that odyssey does.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,060
So I had to do it all manually.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,000
And it took me a long fucking time.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,880
But every video and every stream that I've ever done should be here, including some stuff

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,780
that I might have changed my opinion on over the years, like for example, my early dumping

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,360
with scrumps on kraut.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,260
I've certainly changed my feelings about kraut as a person and later videos do reflect that.

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,680
But in my opinion, it's more important to have my entire backlog up in one place.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,340
And to make that easier for the viewer, every video has been re edited to include a original

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,260
air date in the front just like on bit shoot and just like on odyssey.

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,940
As for where I upload next, I don't know it takes between one week and two weeks to fully

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,960
upload my backlog to a channel, it seems daily motion, maybe is Brady on still a thing?

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm not sure.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,320
In terms of coming back to YouTube, my monetization has actually been slowly progressing.

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,200
I am no longer shadow banned site wide, although I haven't got my monetization back yet.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,040
So I guess that's some form of progress.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,660
And I do intend to shake a few more trees.

27
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,200
But basically what I've set for myself is once I've uploaded the entire SFO backlog

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,300
to all of the alt text sites that I want to upload it to, if I'm still not re monetized

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,500
by then, I will just start a new channel.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,980
And I'm aiming for that to be the new year January 1, because why not?

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,820
It's a great time to start new year's resolutions, maybe start a new channel is a good way to

32
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
start the new year.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,660
And of course, if I were to do that, I would use the devonatized channel that I made a

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,240
month or so ago, it's already got four and a half k subs, I would probably rename it

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
to something else.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,900
But I would convert this channel into the new SFO channel and I would make the old SFO

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,500
channel like a backlog or an archive or a place where I upload, you know, episodes that

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,280
are too spicy for the main channel, if I never get it back, that's what I'll use SFO for.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,900
So if it turns out that I have to make a new channel, this will be the one that you want

40
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,900
to follow.

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,240
But for now, if you like rumble, all my content is there.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,700
And when the new content does come, in fact, scrump, Lilith and I recorded a new dumping

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,500
with scrump a few days ago.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,240
It'll go up on rumble, it'll go up on Bitchute and Odyssey and whatever else I plan to do,

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,400
as well as the old or new SFO YouTube channel.

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,880
And of course, I still do try to stream on game boomers most nights night if all goes

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,600
according to plan, my girlfriend and I will be continuing our cyberpunk 2077 playthrough.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,560
So drop by twitch.tv slash game boomers and come say hi.

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
All right, I guess the next thing for me to do is to figure out whether or not Brady on

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,240
and daily motion are viable.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,620
Is Vimeo still a thing too?

52
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,300
I remember that was a channel that was like a site years and years ago, but I don't think

53
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
anybody uses it anymore.

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,040
Anyway, I'll go figure it out.

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Thanks for sticking with me guys.

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Thanks for watching.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
I'll see you soon.

58
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,060
I love you.
