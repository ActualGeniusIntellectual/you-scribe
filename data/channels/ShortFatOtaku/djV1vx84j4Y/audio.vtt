Hello my friends, this video is meant to announce that I have now uploaded the entire SFO backlog

00:06.320 --> 00:08.440
on my rumble channel.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.400
That is rumble dot com slash short fat otaku.

00:11.400 --> 00:18.520
I know it says here it's like slash c slash c dash three five zero eight eight seven.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.520
Yeah, okay.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.040
But if you just put in short fat otaku and hit enter, you'll get sent to the same place.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.560
So rumble dot com slash short fat otaku rumble is another up and coming alt tech platform

00:30.560 --> 00:36.120
like odyssey and like bit shoot and I've spent maybe the past week and a half uploading my

00:36.120 --> 00:39.280
around 500 videos to this platform.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.300
It does not have an auto sync feature the way that odyssey does.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.060
So I had to do it all manually.

00:45.060 --> 00:48.000
And it took me a long fucking time.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.880
But every video and every stream that I've ever done should be here, including some stuff

00:51.880 --> 00:55.780
that I might have changed my opinion on over the years, like for example, my early dumping

00:55.780 --> 00:57.360
with scrumps on kraut.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.260
I've certainly changed my feelings about kraut as a person and later videos do reflect that.

01:02.260 --> 01:05.680
But in my opinion, it's more important to have my entire backlog up in one place.

01:05.680 --> 01:11.340
And to make that easier for the viewer, every video has been re edited to include a original

01:11.340 --> 01:15.260
air date in the front just like on bit shoot and just like on odyssey.

01:15.260 --> 01:19.940
As for where I upload next, I don't know it takes between one week and two weeks to fully

01:19.940 --> 01:25.960
upload my backlog to a channel, it seems daily motion, maybe is Brady on still a thing?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.240
I'm not sure.

01:27.240 --> 01:33.320
In terms of coming back to YouTube, my monetization has actually been slowly progressing.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.200
I am no longer shadow banned site wide, although I haven't got my monetization back yet.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.040
So I guess that's some form of progress.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.660
And I do intend to shake a few more trees.

01:43.660 --> 01:49.200
But basically what I've set for myself is once I've uploaded the entire SFO backlog

01:49.200 --> 01:54.300
to all of the alt text sites that I want to upload it to, if I'm still not re monetized

01:54.300 --> 01:57.500
by then, I will just start a new channel.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.980
And I'm aiming for that to be the new year January 1, because why not?

02:00.980 --> 02:04.820
It's a great time to start new year's resolutions, maybe start a new channel is a good way to

02:04.820 --> 02:05.820
start the new year.

02:05.820 --> 02:10.660
And of course, if I were to do that, I would use the devonatized channel that I made a

02:10.660 --> 02:15.240
month or so ago, it's already got four and a half k subs, I would probably rename it

02:15.240 --> 02:16.240
to something else.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.900
But I would convert this channel into the new SFO channel and I would make the old SFO

02:19.900 --> 02:24.500
channel like a backlog or an archive or a place where I upload, you know, episodes that

02:24.500 --> 02:29.280
are too spicy for the main channel, if I never get it back, that's what I'll use SFO for.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.900
So if it turns out that I have to make a new channel, this will be the one that you want

02:32.900 --> 02:33.900
to follow.

02:33.900 --> 02:37.240
But for now, if you like rumble, all my content is there.

02:37.240 --> 02:41.700
And when the new content does come, in fact, scrump, Lilith and I recorded a new dumping

02:41.700 --> 02:43.500
with scrump a few days ago.

02:43.500 --> 02:48.240
It'll go up on rumble, it'll go up on Bitchute and Odyssey and whatever else I plan to do,

02:48.240 --> 02:51.400
as well as the old or new SFO YouTube channel.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.880
And of course, I still do try to stream on game boomers most nights night if all goes

02:55.880 --> 03:01.600
according to plan, my girlfriend and I will be continuing our cyberpunk 2077 playthrough.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.560
So drop by twitch.tv slash game boomers and come say hi.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.920
All right, I guess the next thing for me to do is to figure out whether or not Brady on

03:09.920 --> 03:12.240
and daily motion are viable.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.620
Is Vimeo still a thing too?

03:13.620 --> 03:17.300
I remember that was a channel that was like a site years and years ago, but I don't think

03:17.300 --> 03:18.300
anybody uses it anymore.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.040
Anyway, I'll go figure it out.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.040
Thanks for sticking with me guys.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.040
Thanks for watching.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.040
I'll see you soon.

03:24.040 --> 03:24.060
I love you.
