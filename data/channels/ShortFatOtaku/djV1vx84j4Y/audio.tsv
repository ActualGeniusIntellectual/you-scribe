0	6320	Hello my friends, this video is meant to announce that I have now uploaded the entire SFO backlog
6320	8440	on my rumble channel.
8440	11400	That is rumble dot com slash short fat otaku.
11400	18520	I know it says here it's like slash c slash c dash three five zero eight eight seven.
18520	19520	Yeah, okay.
19520	25040	But if you just put in short fat otaku and hit enter, you'll get sent to the same place.
25040	30560	So rumble dot com slash short fat otaku rumble is another up and coming alt tech platform
30560	36120	like odyssey and like bit shoot and I've spent maybe the past week and a half uploading my
36120	39280	around 500 videos to this platform.
39280	43300	It does not have an auto sync feature the way that odyssey does.
43300	45060	So I had to do it all manually.
45060	48000	And it took me a long fucking time.
48000	51880	But every video and every stream that I've ever done should be here, including some stuff
51880	55780	that I might have changed my opinion on over the years, like for example, my early dumping
55780	57360	with scrumps on kraut.
57360	62260	I've certainly changed my feelings about kraut as a person and later videos do reflect that.
62260	65680	But in my opinion, it's more important to have my entire backlog up in one place.
65680	71340	And to make that easier for the viewer, every video has been re edited to include a original
71340	75260	air date in the front just like on bit shoot and just like on odyssey.
75260	79940	As for where I upload next, I don't know it takes between one week and two weeks to fully
79940	85960	upload my backlog to a channel, it seems daily motion, maybe is Brady on still a thing?
85960	87240	I'm not sure.
87240	93320	In terms of coming back to YouTube, my monetization has actually been slowly progressing.
93320	98200	I am no longer shadow banned site wide, although I haven't got my monetization back yet.
98200	101040	So I guess that's some form of progress.
101040	103660	And I do intend to shake a few more trees.
103660	109200	But basically what I've set for myself is once I've uploaded the entire SFO backlog
109200	114300	to all of the alt text sites that I want to upload it to, if I'm still not re monetized
114300	117500	by then, I will just start a new channel.
117500	120980	And I'm aiming for that to be the new year January 1, because why not?
120980	124820	It's a great time to start new year's resolutions, maybe start a new channel is a good way to
124820	125820	start the new year.
125820	130660	And of course, if I were to do that, I would use the devonatized channel that I made a
130660	135240	month or so ago, it's already got four and a half k subs, I would probably rename it
135240	136240	to something else.
136240	139900	But I would convert this channel into the new SFO channel and I would make the old SFO
139900	144500	channel like a backlog or an archive or a place where I upload, you know, episodes that
144500	149280	are too spicy for the main channel, if I never get it back, that's what I'll use SFO for.
149280	152900	So if it turns out that I have to make a new channel, this will be the one that you want
152900	153900	to follow.
153900	157240	But for now, if you like rumble, all my content is there.
157240	161700	And when the new content does come, in fact, scrump, Lilith and I recorded a new dumping
161700	163500	with scrump a few days ago.
163500	168240	It'll go up on rumble, it'll go up on Bitchute and Odyssey and whatever else I plan to do,
168240	171400	as well as the old or new SFO YouTube channel.
171400	175880	And of course, I still do try to stream on game boomers most nights night if all goes
175880	181600	according to plan, my girlfriend and I will be continuing our cyberpunk 2077 playthrough.
181600	186560	So drop by twitch.tv slash game boomers and come say hi.
186560	189920	All right, I guess the next thing for me to do is to figure out whether or not Brady on
189920	192240	and daily motion are viable.
192240	193620	Is Vimeo still a thing too?
193620	197300	I remember that was a channel that was like a site years and years ago, but I don't think
197300	198300	anybody uses it anymore.
198300	201040	Anyway, I'll go figure it out.
201040	202040	Thanks for sticking with me guys.
202040	203040	Thanks for watching.
203040	204040	I'll see you soon.
204040	204060	I love you.
