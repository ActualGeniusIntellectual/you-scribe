00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
Turns out today is International Men's Day, but Twitter isn't pushing anything to celebrate

00:04.320 --> 00:09.600
the accomplishments of men. Did you know about this? Why, yes I did, my friend. Yesterday,

00:09.600 --> 00:14.080
November 19th was International Men's Day, and as far as I saw, it wasn't trending,

00:14.080 --> 00:19.600
nor was there an official moments page on Twitter. Today, the 20th, is the Trans Day of Remembrance,

00:19.600 --> 00:24.160
though, and that's all over Twitter, even though this is honestly the first I've ever heard of that

00:24.160 --> 00:28.480
holiday. I guess it was just an innocent mistake on Twitter's part to not formally recognize

00:28.480 --> 00:33.760
International Men's Day. But hey, Twitter users themselves remembered, and a lot of them did,

00:33.760 --> 00:38.320
making it pretty weird that it didn't actually trend. But nonetheless, there was a bunch of real

00:38.320 --> 00:43.040
solid sentiments about it, pretty much exactly what a good person would say on both International

00:43.040 --> 00:47.360
Men's Day and International Women's Day towards women. And then you get to the usual that we've

00:47.360 --> 00:52.880
all come to expect from Twitter, garbage takes by garbage people. Happy International Men's Day,

00:52.880 --> 00:57.760
especially to trans men, disabled men, men of color, queer men, mentally ill men,

00:57.760 --> 01:02.800
feminine men, elderly men, poor men, male survivors, and other vulnerable men.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.600
I guess this holiday just doesn't extend to any man that doesn't meet those intersectional

01:07.600 --> 01:13.920
standards, eh? Oh look, an IRL form where only men are invited to discuss men's issues.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.840
You know, the same thing that women do for pretty much every feminist space out there.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.760
I wonder what the top replies will be to them. Yeah, that's pretty much what I expected.

01:22.320 --> 01:27.680
Why do women-only spaces get to be women-only, but men-only spaces have to be gender-mixed?

01:27.680 --> 01:32.000
Cut the umbilical cord already, Karen. And of course, there's the usual verificants

01:32.000 --> 01:35.840
who have decided to try and derail the conversation, talking solely about male

01:35.840 --> 01:40.480
feminists and how they are the only good type of man. You know, that higher than average

01:40.480 --> 01:45.600
possibility that they might end up being rapists or abusers must really endear them to the feminist

01:45.600 --> 01:50.080
cause. And really, this is the equivalent of driving by the burning house and thinking,

01:50.080 --> 01:54.560
how can this benefit me? Feminists look at a day like International Men's Day and wonder how this

01:54.560 --> 01:59.440
can be turned to dismantling the oppressive patriarchy, because everything has to be focused

01:59.440 --> 02:04.160
through their narrow lens of interpretation. But in the end, Twitter retards are going to tweet,

02:04.160 --> 02:09.040
let's go upstream to the media, who I am sure have been outputting a bunch of shitty articles

02:09.040 --> 02:13.680
blasting the day for no reason other than they can. This time I decided to challenge myself.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.120
I haven't gone looking to see if any articles exist before I started writing the script for

02:17.120 --> 02:21.280
this video. I'm just betting that they're out there. Let's see what I can find.

02:21.920 --> 02:27.360
Starting off strong from pink news, on International Men's Day, here's 10 quotes

02:27.360 --> 02:32.880
from influential queer men on mental health and self-acceptance. Because on International Men's

02:32.880 --> 02:37.680
Day, being a man isn't enough. You've also got to be queer or you just don't qualify.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.880
On the Daily Mail, should we ban International Men's Day? Good morning Britain viewers clash

02:42.880 --> 02:48.080
over the celebration, with one insisting the event means nothing. How in the hell

02:48.080 --> 02:52.240
would you ban International Men's Day? I mean, there's no official celebration,

02:52.240 --> 02:55.920
people don't get time off from work or whatever. Are you expecting governments around the world

02:55.920 --> 02:59.200
to pass legislation preventing people from talking about it on the internet or something?

02:59.200 --> 03:05.680
While Tamer51 from New Cross South London felt that both women and men should be celebrated,

03:05.680 --> 03:11.280
Andrew from London thought the day was divisive. Man, the Brits really are cucks, aren't they?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.440
There's no reason for both men and women to be celebrated on International Men's Day,

03:15.440 --> 03:18.400
if they're also both not celebrated on International Women's Day.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.640
And International Men's Day is just as divisive as International Women's Day is.

03:22.640 --> 03:27.120
It's like you don't know what equality is despite jabbering on about it constantly.

03:27.120 --> 03:32.640
Oh god, the Mary Sue. Things we saw today. Yes, International Men's Day is a thing.

03:32.640 --> 03:39.440
Surprise! The not female gender exists actually! The idea of a men's day is complicated, since,

03:39.440 --> 03:43.680
much like the recent focus on straight pride parades, a lot of the demand for one comes as

03:43.680 --> 03:48.000
a response to women's day, without recognizing that International Women's Day was born out of

03:48.000 --> 03:52.560
women's marginalization at the hands of cis men. Actually, you've got it all wrong. The demand for

03:52.560 --> 03:57.440
International Men's Day, as well as straight pride parades, or frankly any other public display or

03:57.440 --> 04:02.960
celebration of normativity, is that people are now wise to your game, in place of cultivating

04:02.960 --> 04:07.360
a personality, honing a skill, developing an understanding of something intricate.

04:07.360 --> 04:12.400
You know, doing the long, hard work of becoming a well-rounded human being.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.560
Instead, progressives take a shortcut by emphasizing what is demographically different

04:16.560 --> 04:20.800
about them, rather than anything with actual substance, and then parlay that difference

04:20.800 --> 04:25.200
into political power through advocacy. And if that's the new game, in place of something

04:25.200 --> 04:30.240
like hard work or knowledge, why shouldn't men play it? Why shouldn't straight people,

04:30.240 --> 04:34.240
or white people, or any other group of people that the SJWs despise?

04:34.400 --> 04:38.960
Hey, it's Yahoo style. I didn't even know that Yahoo still existed, to be honest.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.160
Do we need International Men's Day? Debate breaks out.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.880
Well, to be honest, we probably don't need it, the same way we don't really need International

04:46.880 --> 04:51.680
Women's Day. Man, this pesky equality thing really gets in the way of the feminist march

04:51.680 --> 04:56.960
towards utopia, doesn't it? After all, International Men's Day focuses on six pillars.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.200
Highlighting discrimination against men, supporting male health issues, improving

05:01.200 --> 05:06.080
gender relations, promoting gender equality, celebrating male contributions to society,

05:06.080 --> 05:10.560
and promoting male role models. How many of those pillars could the radical feminists

05:10.560 --> 05:14.320
actually object to? Well, they don't believe that discrimination against men exists,

05:14.320 --> 05:18.560
it's all just punching up. They don't believe gender relations can be improved,

05:18.560 --> 05:23.200
because it's all simply a power struggle between opposing tribes, and their tribe needs to win,

05:23.200 --> 05:27.360
and men need to lose, because men are oppressive and they're not. They believe gender equality

05:27.360 --> 05:30.720
refers to balancing everything in women's favor, and when you tell them that's not

05:30.720 --> 05:34.960
actually equality, they shift the goalposts to equity instead. They believe that male

05:34.960 --> 05:40.400
contributions to society were stolen from women or people of color, since we was kangs and shiet,

05:40.400 --> 05:46.160
and they believe male role models are patriarchs. That really only leaves male health issues,

05:46.160 --> 05:50.160
which I can only presume that they're either neutral on, or considered to be female health

05:50.160 --> 05:54.560
issues as well, because they're shared through trans women. People are rallying against toxic

05:54.560 --> 05:59.440
masculinity on International Men's Day. No, people are rallying FOR men on International

05:59.440 --> 06:04.320
Men's Day. Only the rad-lefts are rallying against toxic masculinity. It's men that get to

06:04.320 --> 06:08.800
define what the positive and negative aspects of their gender roles are. And I do not agree that

06:08.800 --> 06:13.760
all of the things feminism shunts under the toxic masculinity label are either toxic or unique to

06:13.760 --> 06:18.240
the masculine. Are people going to rally against toxic femininity on International Women's Day,

06:18.240 --> 06:21.840
or is that going to be considered oppressive to bring up as well? Okay, I'm going to stop searching

06:21.840 --> 06:24.960
for these articles at this point because I've discovered something about this topic.

06:24.960 --> 06:30.320
Should we be celebrating International Men's Day? Well, I don't know. Let me actually consider the

06:30.320 --> 06:34.240
questions instead of just snarking about it this time. Here's the Google searches for the phrase

06:34.240 --> 06:39.040
International Men's Day from 2004 to today. Google's graph might be ass, but you can pretty

06:39.040 --> 06:43.440
easily replicate this yourself by going to trends.google.com. Almost all the time that

06:43.440 --> 06:48.080
International Men's Day is searched is not actually in November, but in March, which is

06:48.080 --> 06:52.720
when International Women's Day is. That's a pretty powerful argument that International

06:52.720 --> 06:58.720
Men's Day only exists as a reaction since people only search for it during its opposite and not

06:58.720 --> 07:03.840
during the holiday itself. This could also be a consequence of the holiday itself being routinely

07:03.840 --> 07:08.320
suppressed by traditional media, social media, and literally everyone else whenever it comes up,

07:08.320 --> 07:12.160
kind of like how it wasn't trending yesterday. But in the end, both arguments lead to the same

07:12.160 --> 07:17.200
conclusion. People don't care about International Men's Day. The SJWs hear this and think,

07:17.200 --> 07:23.120
of course, every day is International Men's Day, obviously. Every public place is a straight pride

07:23.120 --> 07:28.400
parade. Every location is a safe space for white people. All of these things are needed only for

07:28.400 --> 07:33.040
minorities because they live in a world that is actively hostile to them while being structured

07:33.040 --> 07:37.120
for the ease of the majority. Of course. And anyone with a brain can figure out the problem

07:37.120 --> 07:42.320
with this logic. The world is actually hostile towards everyone. Regular people walking around

07:42.320 --> 07:46.560
on the street is not a straight pride parade. It's just people getting on with their lives in

07:46.560 --> 07:52.000
an overly non-sexual way. And there are absolutely locations on this planet, whether they're nations

07:52.000 --> 07:56.560
or neighbourhoods, that are actively hostile against white people. But to the ideologue,

07:56.560 --> 08:02.240
it's all or nothing. It's zero or a hundred. It's on or off. My tribe or yours. So to them,

08:02.240 --> 08:06.960
if it's not a rainbow-coloured float full of naked, jiggling men, it's overpowering

08:06.960 --> 08:11.360
straightriarchy, I guess. But there's a more obvious answer as to why people don't care

08:11.360 --> 08:15.280
about International Men's Day. And no, I don't think it's that men are oppressed or treated

08:15.280 --> 08:20.320
like trash by everyone everywhere MRAs, though that certainly does happen. I think it's because

08:20.320 --> 08:24.960
men are too busy getting on with their lives to actually care one way or another about the holiday.

08:24.960 --> 08:30.000
There's too much shit to do. School to study for, work to attend, businesses to build, athletics to

08:30.000 --> 08:34.880
train for, money to earn, partners to romance, friendships to cultivate, art to create, books to

08:34.880 --> 08:41.360
read, books to write, gardens to grow. Whatever it is, men are not only busy, but men often take

08:41.360 --> 08:46.880
pride in how busy they are. It might be a stereotype that men do and women exist, but

08:46.880 --> 08:51.280
there's always at least a nugget of truth in a stereotype. It's why men define themselves proudly

08:51.280 --> 08:55.920
or otherwise by what they do, sometimes more positively by what they've built, sometimes

08:55.920 --> 09:01.520
more negatively by how much they earn, sometimes self-destructively by how useless they are,

09:01.520 --> 09:06.080
but always as a subset of what they're doing. And you know, speaking as a relatively normal guy,

09:06.080 --> 09:10.880
we're generally happy with this arrangement. I'm happy to work hard and reap the fruits of it if I

09:10.960 --> 09:14.480
get to choose the work. I don't need an international men's day because I have more than

09:14.480 --> 09:18.720
enough happening in my life that I don't need to take a day off to celebrate my penis just to feel

09:18.720 --> 09:24.400
good about it. So if there are actually that many women who really need a celebration once a year,

09:24.400 --> 09:29.120
where they get praised solely for existing and having a vagina, and they covet that celebration

09:29.120 --> 09:33.920
so much that they'd scream bloody murder at its criticism or view the implementation of its

09:33.920 --> 09:38.240
gendered opposite as a threat, those women probably need to seriously reconsider the

09:38.240 --> 09:39.680
trajectory of their life.
