0	4320	Turns out today is International Men's Day, but Twitter isn't pushing anything to celebrate
4320	9600	the accomplishments of men. Did you know about this? Why, yes I did, my friend. Yesterday,
9600	14080	November 19th was International Men's Day, and as far as I saw, it wasn't trending,
14080	19600	nor was there an official moments page on Twitter. Today, the 20th, is the Trans Day of Remembrance,
19600	24160	though, and that's all over Twitter, even though this is honestly the first I've ever heard of that
24160	28480	holiday. I guess it was just an innocent mistake on Twitter's part to not formally recognize
28480	33760	International Men's Day. But hey, Twitter users themselves remembered, and a lot of them did,
33760	38320	making it pretty weird that it didn't actually trend. But nonetheless, there was a bunch of real
38320	43040	solid sentiments about it, pretty much exactly what a good person would say on both International
43040	47360	Men's Day and International Women's Day towards women. And then you get to the usual that we've
47360	52880	all come to expect from Twitter, garbage takes by garbage people. Happy International Men's Day,
52880	57760	especially to trans men, disabled men, men of color, queer men, mentally ill men,
57760	62800	feminine men, elderly men, poor men, male survivors, and other vulnerable men.
62800	67600	I guess this holiday just doesn't extend to any man that doesn't meet those intersectional
67600	73920	standards, eh? Oh look, an IRL form where only men are invited to discuss men's issues.
73920	77840	You know, the same thing that women do for pretty much every feminist space out there.
77840	81760	I wonder what the top replies will be to them. Yeah, that's pretty much what I expected.
82320	87680	Why do women-only spaces get to be women-only, but men-only spaces have to be gender-mixed?
87680	92000	Cut the umbilical cord already, Karen. And of course, there's the usual verificants
92000	95840	who have decided to try and derail the conversation, talking solely about male
95840	100480	feminists and how they are the only good type of man. You know, that higher than average
100480	105600	possibility that they might end up being rapists or abusers must really endear them to the feminist
105600	110080	cause. And really, this is the equivalent of driving by the burning house and thinking,
110080	114560	how can this benefit me? Feminists look at a day like International Men's Day and wonder how this
114560	119440	can be turned to dismantling the oppressive patriarchy, because everything has to be focused
119440	124160	through their narrow lens of interpretation. But in the end, Twitter retards are going to tweet,
124160	129040	let's go upstream to the media, who I am sure have been outputting a bunch of shitty articles
129040	133680	blasting the day for no reason other than they can. This time I decided to challenge myself.
133680	137120	I haven't gone looking to see if any articles exist before I started writing the script for
137120	141280	this video. I'm just betting that they're out there. Let's see what I can find.
141920	147360	Starting off strong from pink news, on International Men's Day, here's 10 quotes
147360	152880	from influential queer men on mental health and self-acceptance. Because on International Men's
152880	157680	Day, being a man isn't enough. You've also got to be queer or you just don't qualify.
157680	162880	On the Daily Mail, should we ban International Men's Day? Good morning Britain viewers clash
162880	168080	over the celebration, with one insisting the event means nothing. How in the hell
168080	172240	would you ban International Men's Day? I mean, there's no official celebration,
172240	175920	people don't get time off from work or whatever. Are you expecting governments around the world
175920	179200	to pass legislation preventing people from talking about it on the internet or something?
179200	185680	While Tamer51 from New Cross South London felt that both women and men should be celebrated,
185680	191280	Andrew from London thought the day was divisive. Man, the Brits really are cucks, aren't they?
192000	195440	There's no reason for both men and women to be celebrated on International Men's Day,
195440	198400	if they're also both not celebrated on International Women's Day.
198400	202640	And International Men's Day is just as divisive as International Women's Day is.
202640	207120	It's like you don't know what equality is despite jabbering on about it constantly.
207120	212640	Oh god, the Mary Sue. Things we saw today. Yes, International Men's Day is a thing.
212640	219440	Surprise! The not female gender exists actually! The idea of a men's day is complicated, since,
219440	223680	much like the recent focus on straight pride parades, a lot of the demand for one comes as
223680	228000	a response to women's day, without recognizing that International Women's Day was born out of
228000	232560	women's marginalization at the hands of cis men. Actually, you've got it all wrong. The demand for
232560	237440	International Men's Day, as well as straight pride parades, or frankly any other public display or
237440	242960	celebration of normativity, is that people are now wise to your game, in place of cultivating
242960	247360	a personality, honing a skill, developing an understanding of something intricate.
247360	252400	You know, doing the long, hard work of becoming a well-rounded human being.
252400	256560	Instead, progressives take a shortcut by emphasizing what is demographically different
256560	260800	about them, rather than anything with actual substance, and then parlay that difference
260800	265200	into political power through advocacy. And if that's the new game, in place of something
265200	270240	like hard work or knowledge, why shouldn't men play it? Why shouldn't straight people,
270240	274240	or white people, or any other group of people that the SJWs despise?
274400	278960	Hey, it's Yahoo style. I didn't even know that Yahoo still existed, to be honest.
279520	282160	Do we need International Men's Day? Debate breaks out.
283040	286880	Well, to be honest, we probably don't need it, the same way we don't really need International
286880	291680	Women's Day. Man, this pesky equality thing really gets in the way of the feminist march
291680	296960	towards utopia, doesn't it? After all, International Men's Day focuses on six pillars.
296960	301200	Highlighting discrimination against men, supporting male health issues, improving
301200	306080	gender relations, promoting gender equality, celebrating male contributions to society,
306080	310560	and promoting male role models. How many of those pillars could the radical feminists
310560	314320	actually object to? Well, they don't believe that discrimination against men exists,
314320	318560	it's all just punching up. They don't believe gender relations can be improved,
318560	323200	because it's all simply a power struggle between opposing tribes, and their tribe needs to win,
323200	327360	and men need to lose, because men are oppressive and they're not. They believe gender equality
327360	330720	refers to balancing everything in women's favor, and when you tell them that's not
330720	334960	actually equality, they shift the goalposts to equity instead. They believe that male
334960	340400	contributions to society were stolen from women or people of color, since we was kangs and shiet,
340400	346160	and they believe male role models are patriarchs. That really only leaves male health issues,
346160	350160	which I can only presume that they're either neutral on, or considered to be female health
350160	354560	issues as well, because they're shared through trans women. People are rallying against toxic
354560	359440	masculinity on International Men's Day. No, people are rallying FOR men on International
359440	364320	Men's Day. Only the rad-lefts are rallying against toxic masculinity. It's men that get to
364320	368800	define what the positive and negative aspects of their gender roles are. And I do not agree that
368800	373760	all of the things feminism shunts under the toxic masculinity label are either toxic or unique to
373760	378240	the masculine. Are people going to rally against toxic femininity on International Women's Day,
378240	381840	or is that going to be considered oppressive to bring up as well? Okay, I'm going to stop searching
381840	384960	for these articles at this point because I've discovered something about this topic.
384960	390320	Should we be celebrating International Men's Day? Well, I don't know. Let me actually consider the
390320	394240	questions instead of just snarking about it this time. Here's the Google searches for the phrase
394240	399040	International Men's Day from 2004 to today. Google's graph might be ass, but you can pretty
399040	403440	easily replicate this yourself by going to trends.google.com. Almost all the time that
403440	408080	International Men's Day is searched is not actually in November, but in March, which is
408080	412720	when International Women's Day is. That's a pretty powerful argument that International
412720	418720	Men's Day only exists as a reaction since people only search for it during its opposite and not
418720	423840	during the holiday itself. This could also be a consequence of the holiday itself being routinely
423840	428320	suppressed by traditional media, social media, and literally everyone else whenever it comes up,
428320	432160	kind of like how it wasn't trending yesterday. But in the end, both arguments lead to the same
432160	437200	conclusion. People don't care about International Men's Day. The SJWs hear this and think,
437200	443120	of course, every day is International Men's Day, obviously. Every public place is a straight pride
443120	448400	parade. Every location is a safe space for white people. All of these things are needed only for
448400	453040	minorities because they live in a world that is actively hostile to them while being structured
453040	457120	for the ease of the majority. Of course. And anyone with a brain can figure out the problem
457120	462320	with this logic. The world is actually hostile towards everyone. Regular people walking around
462320	466560	on the street is not a straight pride parade. It's just people getting on with their lives in
466560	472000	an overly non-sexual way. And there are absolutely locations on this planet, whether they're nations
472000	476560	or neighbourhoods, that are actively hostile against white people. But to the ideologue,
476560	482240	it's all or nothing. It's zero or a hundred. It's on or off. My tribe or yours. So to them,
482240	486960	if it's not a rainbow-coloured float full of naked, jiggling men, it's overpowering
486960	491360	straightriarchy, I guess. But there's a more obvious answer as to why people don't care
491360	495280	about International Men's Day. And no, I don't think it's that men are oppressed or treated
495280	500320	like trash by everyone everywhere MRAs, though that certainly does happen. I think it's because
500320	504960	men are too busy getting on with their lives to actually care one way or another about the holiday.
504960	510000	There's too much shit to do. School to study for, work to attend, businesses to build, athletics to
510000	514880	train for, money to earn, partners to romance, friendships to cultivate, art to create, books to
514880	521360	read, books to write, gardens to grow. Whatever it is, men are not only busy, but men often take
521360	526880	pride in how busy they are. It might be a stereotype that men do and women exist, but
526880	531280	there's always at least a nugget of truth in a stereotype. It's why men define themselves proudly
531280	535920	or otherwise by what they do, sometimes more positively by what they've built, sometimes
535920	541520	more negatively by how much they earn, sometimes self-destructively by how useless they are,
541520	546080	but always as a subset of what they're doing. And you know, speaking as a relatively normal guy,
546080	550880	we're generally happy with this arrangement. I'm happy to work hard and reap the fruits of it if I
550960	554480	get to choose the work. I don't need an international men's day because I have more than
554480	558720	enough happening in my life that I don't need to take a day off to celebrate my penis just to feel
558720	564400	good about it. So if there are actually that many women who really need a celebration once a year,
564400	569120	where they get praised solely for existing and having a vagina, and they covet that celebration
569120	573920	so much that they'd scream bloody murder at its criticism or view the implementation of its
573920	578240	gendered opposite as a threat, those women probably need to seriously reconsider the
578240	579680	trajectory of their life.
