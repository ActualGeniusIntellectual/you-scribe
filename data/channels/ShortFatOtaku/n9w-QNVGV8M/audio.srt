00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Turns out today is International Men's Day, but Twitter isn't pushing anything to celebrate

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,600
the accomplishments of men. Did you know about this? Why, yes I did, my friend. Yesterday,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,080
November 19th was International Men's Day, and as far as I saw, it wasn't trending,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,600
nor was there an official moments page on Twitter. Today, the 20th, is the Trans Day of Remembrance,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
though, and that's all over Twitter, even though this is honestly the first I've ever heard of that

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,480
holiday. I guess it was just an innocent mistake on Twitter's part to not formally recognize

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,760
International Men's Day. But hey, Twitter users themselves remembered, and a lot of them did,

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,320
making it pretty weird that it didn't actually trend. But nonetheless, there was a bunch of real

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,040
solid sentiments about it, pretty much exactly what a good person would say on both International

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
Men's Day and International Women's Day towards women. And then you get to the usual that we've

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,880
all come to expect from Twitter, garbage takes by garbage people. Happy International Men's Day,

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,760
especially to trans men, disabled men, men of color, queer men, mentally ill men,

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,800
feminine men, elderly men, poor men, male survivors, and other vulnerable men.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,600
I guess this holiday just doesn't extend to any man that doesn't meet those intersectional

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,920
standards, eh? Oh look, an IRL form where only men are invited to discuss men's issues.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
You know, the same thing that women do for pretty much every feminist space out there.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,760
I wonder what the top replies will be to them. Yeah, that's pretty much what I expected.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,680
Why do women-only spaces get to be women-only, but men-only spaces have to be gender-mixed?

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
Cut the umbilical cord already, Karen. And of course, there's the usual verificants

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
who have decided to try and derail the conversation, talking solely about male

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,480
feminists and how they are the only good type of man. You know, that higher than average

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,600
possibility that they might end up being rapists or abusers must really endear them to the feminist

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,080
cause. And really, this is the equivalent of driving by the burning house and thinking,

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,560
how can this benefit me? Feminists look at a day like International Men's Day and wonder how this

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,440
can be turned to dismantling the oppressive patriarchy, because everything has to be focused

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,160
through their narrow lens of interpretation. But in the end, Twitter retards are going to tweet,

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,040
let's go upstream to the media, who I am sure have been outputting a bunch of shitty articles

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,680
blasting the day for no reason other than they can. This time I decided to challenge myself.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
I haven't gone looking to see if any articles exist before I started writing the script for

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,280
this video. I'm just betting that they're out there. Let's see what I can find.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,360
Starting off strong from pink news, on International Men's Day, here's 10 quotes

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,880
from influential queer men on mental health and self-acceptance. Because on International Men's

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,680
Day, being a man isn't enough. You've also got to be queer or you just don't qualify.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,880
On the Daily Mail, should we ban International Men's Day? Good morning Britain viewers clash

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,080
over the celebration, with one insisting the event means nothing. How in the hell

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,240
would you ban International Men's Day? I mean, there's no official celebration,

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,920
people don't get time off from work or whatever. Are you expecting governments around the world

38
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
to pass legislation preventing people from talking about it on the internet or something?

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,680
While Tamer51 from New Cross South London felt that both women and men should be celebrated,

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,280
Andrew from London thought the day was divisive. Man, the Brits really are cucks, aren't they?

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,440
There's no reason for both men and women to be celebrated on International Men's Day,

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,400
if they're also both not celebrated on International Women's Day.

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
And International Men's Day is just as divisive as International Women's Day is.

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,120
It's like you don't know what equality is despite jabbering on about it constantly.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,640
Oh god, the Mary Sue. Things we saw today. Yes, International Men's Day is a thing.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,440
Surprise! The not female gender exists actually! The idea of a men's day is complicated, since,

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
much like the recent focus on straight pride parades, a lot of the demand for one comes as

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,000
a response to women's day, without recognizing that International Women's Day was born out of

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
women's marginalization at the hands of cis men. Actually, you've got it all wrong. The demand for

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,440
International Men's Day, as well as straight pride parades, or frankly any other public display or

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,960
celebration of normativity, is that people are now wise to your game, in place of cultivating

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,360
a personality, honing a skill, developing an understanding of something intricate.

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,400
You know, doing the long, hard work of becoming a well-rounded human being.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
Instead, progressives take a shortcut by emphasizing what is demographically different

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,800
about them, rather than anything with actual substance, and then parlay that difference

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,200
into political power through advocacy. And if that's the new game, in place of something

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,240
like hard work or knowledge, why shouldn't men play it? Why shouldn't straight people,

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
or white people, or any other group of people that the SJWs despise?

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,960
Hey, it's Yahoo style. I didn't even know that Yahoo still existed, to be honest.

60
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,160
Do we need International Men's Day? Debate breaks out.

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,880
Well, to be honest, we probably don't need it, the same way we don't really need International

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,680
Women's Day. Man, this pesky equality thing really gets in the way of the feminist march

63
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,960
towards utopia, doesn't it? After all, International Men's Day focuses on six pillars.

64
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,200
Highlighting discrimination against men, supporting male health issues, improving

65
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,080
gender relations, promoting gender equality, celebrating male contributions to society,

66
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,560
and promoting male role models. How many of those pillars could the radical feminists

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
actually object to? Well, they don't believe that discrimination against men exists,

68
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,560
it's all just punching up. They don't believe gender relations can be improved,

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,200
because it's all simply a power struggle between opposing tribes, and their tribe needs to win,

70
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,360
and men need to lose, because men are oppressive and they're not. They believe gender equality

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
refers to balancing everything in women's favor, and when you tell them that's not

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
actually equality, they shift the goalposts to equity instead. They believe that male

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,400
contributions to society were stolen from women or people of color, since we was kangs and shiet,

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,160
and they believe male role models are patriarchs. That really only leaves male health issues,

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
which I can only presume that they're either neutral on, or considered to be female health

76
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
issues as well, because they're shared through trans women. People are rallying against toxic

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,440
masculinity on International Men's Day. No, people are rallying FOR men on International

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,320
Men's Day. Only the rad-lefts are rallying against toxic masculinity. It's men that get to

79
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,800
define what the positive and negative aspects of their gender roles are. And I do not agree that

80
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,760
all of the things feminism shunts under the toxic masculinity label are either toxic or unique to

81
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,240
the masculine. Are people going to rally against toxic femininity on International Women's Day,

82
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
or is that going to be considered oppressive to bring up as well? Okay, I'm going to stop searching

83
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
for these articles at this point because I've discovered something about this topic.

84
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,320
Should we be celebrating International Men's Day? Well, I don't know. Let me actually consider the

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,240
questions instead of just snarking about it this time. Here's the Google searches for the phrase

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,040
International Men's Day from 2004 to today. Google's graph might be ass, but you can pretty

87
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,440
easily replicate this yourself by going to trends.google.com. Almost all the time that

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,080
International Men's Day is searched is not actually in November, but in March, which is

89
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,720
when International Women's Day is. That's a pretty powerful argument that International

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Men's Day only exists as a reaction since people only search for it during its opposite and not

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
during the holiday itself. This could also be a consequence of the holiday itself being routinely

92
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,320
suppressed by traditional media, social media, and literally everyone else whenever it comes up,

93
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,160
kind of like how it wasn't trending yesterday. But in the end, both arguments lead to the same

94
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,200
conclusion. People don't care about International Men's Day. The SJWs hear this and think,

95
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,120
of course, every day is International Men's Day, obviously. Every public place is a straight pride

96
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,400
parade. Every location is a safe space for white people. All of these things are needed only for

97
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,040
minorities because they live in a world that is actively hostile to them while being structured

98
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,120
for the ease of the majority. Of course. And anyone with a brain can figure out the problem

99
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,320
with this logic. The world is actually hostile towards everyone. Regular people walking around

100
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,560
on the street is not a straight pride parade. It's just people getting on with their lives in

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,000
an overly non-sexual way. And there are absolutely locations on this planet, whether they're nations

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,560
or neighbourhoods, that are actively hostile against white people. But to the ideologue,

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,240
it's all or nothing. It's zero or a hundred. It's on or off. My tribe or yours. So to them,

104
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,960
if it's not a rainbow-coloured float full of naked, jiggling men, it's overpowering

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,360
straightriarchy, I guess. But there's a more obvious answer as to why people don't care

106
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,280
about International Men's Day. And no, I don't think it's that men are oppressed or treated

107
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,320
like trash by everyone everywhere MRAs, though that certainly does happen. I think it's because

108
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,960
men are too busy getting on with their lives to actually care one way or another about the holiday.

109
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,000
There's too much shit to do. School to study for, work to attend, businesses to build, athletics to

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,880
train for, money to earn, partners to romance, friendships to cultivate, art to create, books to

111
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,360
read, books to write, gardens to grow. Whatever it is, men are not only busy, but men often take

112
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,880
pride in how busy they are. It might be a stereotype that men do and women exist, but

113
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,280
there's always at least a nugget of truth in a stereotype. It's why men define themselves proudly

114
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,920
or otherwise by what they do, sometimes more positively by what they've built, sometimes

115
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,520
more negatively by how much they earn, sometimes self-destructively by how useless they are,

116
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,080
but always as a subset of what they're doing. And you know, speaking as a relatively normal guy,

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,880
we're generally happy with this arrangement. I'm happy to work hard and reap the fruits of it if I

118
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,480
get to choose the work. I don't need an international men's day because I have more than

119
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,720
enough happening in my life that I don't need to take a day off to celebrate my penis just to feel

120
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,400
good about it. So if there are actually that many women who really need a celebration once a year,

121
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,120
where they get praised solely for existing and having a vagina, and they covet that celebration

122
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,920
so much that they'd scream bloody murder at its criticism or view the implementation of its

123
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,240
gendered opposite as a threat, those women probably need to seriously reconsider the

124
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,680
trajectory of their life.
