0	5200	Hello my friends, I'm not going to be able to make you a traditional video today unfortunately,
5200	10240	but I do have something special. I'm currently cleaning out a whole bunch of stuff and I came
10240	15600	across this and I figured before I pitch it out it might be interesting just to document it and
15600	23760	take a look at what it is. Oh yeah there's also three bags of buttons. These are NDP buttons.
23760	29200	The NDP is Canada's social democratic party, though they used to be more of a straight up
29200	34240	communist party, but they've moderated a lot of their rhetoric in the past say 50 years or so.
34240	38640	They are historically Canada's third party, though they've actually dropped down quite a bit in
38640	43600	popularity in the past say 10 years or so. The height of their popularity was under Jack Layton,
43600	47600	who is one of the most beloved Canadian politicians despite never becoming prime minister.
47600	52160	They often spend their time advocating for quasi-socialist policies and punching at the
52160	58560	liberals from the extreme left of the spectrum. The reason that we have all of this NDP stuff in
58560	65600	the house is because my editor Dave, you'll know him as my co-host on Game Boomers and also as the
65600	70960	original SFO from way back in the day during the 2009 anime reviews. He's been part of the channel
70960	78320	this entire time. During his stint at university he was actually part of the NDP. He was a filthy
78320	82800	commie. Don't worry, we've since de-radicalized him, but he wanted to be more politically involved
82800	87040	and so he said that he might want to do some kind of canvassing for them and they gave him a pack
87040	92400	of materials. As you can see, nothing was ever done with it. So before we get rid of it, I
92400	98560	figured we'd take a look at it and see what's up. Anyone want a pin? Nah, they're all just going in
98560	107680	the recycling. They are, you know, like very normal pin. Nothing too special. NDP youth.
107680	114560	There's some stickers. Proud new Democrat. Proud human rights defender.
115840	122080	With the, uh, with the fist. Is that barbed wire on the fist? Jesus. These still even stick?
125600	126000	They do.
128720	133840	Yep, even after all these years the adhesive's still good. I should go stick these in random
133840	137440	places around the house just as a joke. You know what, I'll put one on our front door so
137440	144320	that other NDP pollsters stop fucking bothering us. There we go.
156880	165840	Let's see what's inside. Oh, flyers! It takes an act of love to realize that we're all in
165840	171600	this together. And an act of courage to dream better. I gotta do a video on this guy, by the
171600	175680	way. He's like insanely corrupt. He's the leader of the NDP right now. Oh boy.
179760	181760	Oh, there's more buttons in here. Okay.
181760	196960	Okay. Jesus. Wow. Just a whole bunch of shit. I mean, I think it might be illegal to knowingly
196960	201440	dispose of election materials. This is from an election that was like three or four years ago.
201440	206320	I'm sure at this point it's fine, right? Oh man, the really cringy slip is gone. I think I'll be
206320	211120	able to find a picture of it online, I hope. It was like an instructional pamphlet of what to do
211120	216800	with this stuff and like where to go vote and that sort of thing. And it had on it like the
216800	223520	most cringy woke ID poll shit you can imagine. There was literally like a black trans woman in
223520	227760	a wheelchair. I don't think anyone in Canada actually looks like this dude. I don't know.
227760	235200	Okay. Anyway, house cleaning continues. This stuff's going out. Thankfully Dave's stint as
235200	240240	being a commie was short-lived and I will return with more videos shortly. Probably tomorrow.
240640	253760	Yeah, you'll see. I'll see you next time, guys. I love you.
260640	263760	Got him. Rain Max.
