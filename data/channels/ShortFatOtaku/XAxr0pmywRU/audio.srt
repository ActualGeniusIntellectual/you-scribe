Hello my friends, I'm not going to be able to make you a traditional video today unfortunately,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,240
but I do have something special. I'm currently cleaning out a whole bunch of stuff and I came

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,600
across this and I figured before I pitch it out it might be interesting just to document it and

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,760
take a look at what it is. Oh yeah there's also three bags of buttons. These are NDP buttons.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,200
The NDP is Canada's social democratic party, though they used to be more of a straight up

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,240
communist party, but they've moderated a lot of their rhetoric in the past say 50 years or so.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,640
They are historically Canada's third party, though they've actually dropped down quite a bit in

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,600
popularity in the past say 10 years or so. The height of their popularity was under Jack Layton,

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
who is one of the most beloved Canadian politicians despite never becoming prime minister.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
They often spend their time advocating for quasi-socialist policies and punching at the

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,560
liberals from the extreme left of the spectrum. The reason that we have all of this NDP stuff in

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,600
the house is because my editor Dave, you'll know him as my co-host on Game Boomers and also as the

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,960
original SFO from way back in the day during the 2009 anime reviews. He's been part of the channel

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,320
this entire time. During his stint at university he was actually part of the NDP. He was a filthy

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,800
commie. Don't worry, we've since de-radicalized him, but he wanted to be more politically involved

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,040
and so he said that he might want to do some kind of canvassing for them and they gave him a pack

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,400
of materials. As you can see, nothing was ever done with it. So before we get rid of it, I

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,560
figured we'd take a look at it and see what's up. Anyone want a pin? Nah, they're all just going in

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:47,680
the recycling. They are, you know, like very normal pin. Nothing too special. NDP youth.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,560
There's some stickers. Proud new Democrat. Proud human rights defender.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,080
With the, uh, with the fist. Is that barbed wire on the fist? Jesus. These still even stick?

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,000
They do.

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,840
Yep, even after all these years the adhesive's still good. I should go stick these in random

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,440
places around the house just as a joke. You know what, I'll put one on our front door so

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,320
that other NDP pollsters stop fucking bothering us. There we go.

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,840
Let's see what's inside. Oh, flyers! It takes an act of love to realize that we're all in

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,600
this together. And an act of courage to dream better. I gotta do a video on this guy, by the

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,680
way. He's like insanely corrupt. He's the leader of the NDP right now. Oh boy.

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Oh, there's more buttons in here. Okay.

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:16,960
Okay. Jesus. Wow. Just a whole bunch of shit. I mean, I think it might be illegal to knowingly

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,440
dispose of election materials. This is from an election that was like three or four years ago.

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm sure at this point it's fine, right? Oh man, the really cringy slip is gone. I think I'll be

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,120
able to find a picture of it online, I hope. It was like an instructional pamphlet of what to do

34
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,800
with this stuff and like where to go vote and that sort of thing. And it had on it like the

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,520
most cringy woke ID poll shit you can imagine. There was literally like a black trans woman in

36
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,760
a wheelchair. I don't think anyone in Canada actually looks like this dude. I don't know.

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,200
Okay. Anyway, house cleaning continues. This stuff's going out. Thankfully Dave's stint as

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,240
being a commie was short-lived and I will return with more videos shortly. Probably tomorrow.

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:13,760
Yeah, you'll see. I'll see you next time, guys. I love you.

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,760
Got him. Rain Max.
