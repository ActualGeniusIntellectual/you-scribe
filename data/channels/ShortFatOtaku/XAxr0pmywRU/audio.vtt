Hello my friends, I'm not going to be able to make you a traditional video today unfortunately,

00:05.200 --> 00:10.240
but I do have something special. I'm currently cleaning out a whole bunch of stuff and I came

00:10.240 --> 00:15.600
across this and I figured before I pitch it out it might be interesting just to document it and

00:15.600 --> 00:23.760
take a look at what it is. Oh yeah there's also three bags of buttons. These are NDP buttons.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.200
The NDP is Canada's social democratic party, though they used to be more of a straight up

00:29.200 --> 00:34.240
communist party, but they've moderated a lot of their rhetoric in the past say 50 years or so.

00:34.240 --> 00:38.640
They are historically Canada's third party, though they've actually dropped down quite a bit in

00:38.640 --> 00:43.600
popularity in the past say 10 years or so. The height of their popularity was under Jack Layton,

00:43.600 --> 00:47.600
who is one of the most beloved Canadian politicians despite never becoming prime minister.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.160
They often spend their time advocating for quasi-socialist policies and punching at the

00:52.160 --> 00:58.560
liberals from the extreme left of the spectrum. The reason that we have all of this NDP stuff in

00:58.560 --> 01:05.600
the house is because my editor Dave, you'll know him as my co-host on Game Boomers and also as the

01:05.600 --> 01:10.960
original SFO from way back in the day during the 2009 anime reviews. He's been part of the channel

01:10.960 --> 01:18.320
this entire time. During his stint at university he was actually part of the NDP. He was a filthy

01:18.320 --> 01:22.800
commie. Don't worry, we've since de-radicalized him, but he wanted to be more politically involved

01:22.800 --> 01:27.040
and so he said that he might want to do some kind of canvassing for them and they gave him a pack

01:27.040 --> 01:32.400
of materials. As you can see, nothing was ever done with it. So before we get rid of it, I

01:32.400 --> 01:38.560
figured we'd take a look at it and see what's up. Anyone want a pin? Nah, they're all just going in

01:38.560 --> 01:47.680
the recycling. They are, you know, like very normal pin. Nothing too special. NDP youth.

01:47.680 --> 01:54.560
There's some stickers. Proud new Democrat. Proud human rights defender.

01:55.840 --> 02:02.080
With the, uh, with the fist. Is that barbed wire on the fist? Jesus. These still even stick?

02:05.600 --> 02:06.000
They do.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.840
Yep, even after all these years the adhesive's still good. I should go stick these in random

02:13.840 --> 02:17.440
places around the house just as a joke. You know what, I'll put one on our front door so

02:17.440 --> 02:24.320
that other NDP pollsters stop fucking bothering us. There we go.

02:36.880 --> 02:45.840
Let's see what's inside. Oh, flyers! It takes an act of love to realize that we're all in

02:45.840 --> 02:51.600
this together. And an act of courage to dream better. I gotta do a video on this guy, by the

02:51.600 --> 02:55.680
way. He's like insanely corrupt. He's the leader of the NDP right now. Oh boy.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.760
Oh, there's more buttons in here. Okay.

03:01.760 --> 03:16.960
Okay. Jesus. Wow. Just a whole bunch of shit. I mean, I think it might be illegal to knowingly

03:16.960 --> 03:21.440
dispose of election materials. This is from an election that was like three or four years ago.

03:21.440 --> 03:26.320
I'm sure at this point it's fine, right? Oh man, the really cringy slip is gone. I think I'll be

03:26.320 --> 03:31.120
able to find a picture of it online, I hope. It was like an instructional pamphlet of what to do

03:31.120 --> 03:36.800
with this stuff and like where to go vote and that sort of thing. And it had on it like the

03:36.800 --> 03:43.520
most cringy woke ID poll shit you can imagine. There was literally like a black trans woman in

03:43.520 --> 03:47.760
a wheelchair. I don't think anyone in Canada actually looks like this dude. I don't know.

03:47.760 --> 03:55.200
Okay. Anyway, house cleaning continues. This stuff's going out. Thankfully Dave's stint as

03:55.200 --> 04:00.240
being a commie was short-lived and I will return with more videos shortly. Probably tomorrow.

04:00.640 --> 04:13.760
Yeah, you'll see. I'll see you next time, guys. I love you.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.760
Got him. Rain Max.
