WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.440
What a song to listen to at the start of the day.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.440
It's Sciitis!

00:13.440 --> 00:18.800
Alright, so it's 10am, the next batch of plants should have come in, so Naomi and I are going

00:18.800 --> 00:24.640
to go and hopefully pick up our cucumbers, since that's the last thing that we need to

00:24.640 --> 00:27.840
get the garden going.

00:27.840 --> 00:34.400
So Naomi, we're at the store again one week later, there's Naomi's feet, and what kind

00:34.400 --> 00:36.760
of cucumbers do you want now that they're here?

00:36.760 --> 00:41.280
English cucumbers, or Japanese cucumbers, no, Lebanese, sorry.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.280
Do you need more tights?

00:43.280 --> 00:44.280
Ow!

00:44.280 --> 00:46.280
I thought you just cut myself off.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
Regular cucumbers.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.280
Regular cucumbers.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.280
Do you have a preference?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
Nope.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.320
Actually, I think they're pretty much the same.

00:52.320 --> 00:58.640
So we're going to grab four of these and head back home and finish up the planting

00:58.640 --> 00:59.640
for this year.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.640
Naomi, the car's a mess again.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.240
It's your fault, stop fucking up my car with your goddamn plants.

01:05.240 --> 01:08.160
Yeah, but you're still going to eat these cucumbers and like them.

01:08.160 --> 01:13.400
Okay, we're back at the garden, and same situation as last time.

01:13.400 --> 01:18.760
Take a hole, manure time, in it goes.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.600
Cucumber in it, and then we just bury it up.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.800
Yeah, there we go.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.920
All four cucumbers are in.

01:25.920 --> 01:31.600
Now, the trellis looks no good, but maybe it'll last one more year.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.720
It's still holding together, right?

01:33.720 --> 01:38.320
And with that, we have basically set the garden up for the year.

01:38.320 --> 01:43.920
The cucumbers are in, peppers charred because we have too much kale, beans instead of peas

01:43.920 --> 01:45.960
this year, and the tomatoes.

01:45.960 --> 01:48.920
So, let's see how it all turns out.

01:54.200 --> 01:59.440
I just saw this guys, oh no, it's frost time.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.400
Take preventative measures to protect frost-sensitive plants.

02:03.400 --> 02:08.640
Alright, so we're here in the middle of the night, and by we I don't mean Naomi this time,

02:08.640 --> 02:15.880
I mean Dave, fresh off my Garogua playthrough, because Naomi cannot help me with the garden

02:15.880 --> 02:20.360
right now, as she just had all four of her wisdom teeth pulled, so Dave's stepping in.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.360
Um, where is the tarp?

02:24.360 --> 02:29.360
Uh, I know we still have it here somewhere.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.280
So there's gonna be frost tonight, actually I think tomorrow night too, so we gotta get

02:33.280 --> 02:37.240
the tarp.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.080
Garden looks good, even in the night time.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.960
So because of the frost, we're gonna put the tarp on, we're gonna take it off tomorrow,

02:42.960 --> 02:47.480
maybe nine or ten o'clock in the morning, hopefully this will work out.

02:47.480 --> 02:54.080
Hopefully this won't do as poorly as that time when the rain hit.

02:54.080 --> 03:02.400
That was, yeah, about water weight, so there should be some, there's these patio stones

03:02.400 --> 03:07.280
that are hanging around, you can just get it mostly over the beans, that'll be fine.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.920
Who knows if that'll actually work out, but maybe it will.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.920
I guess we'll have to see.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.600
Yeah, this'll probably work out.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.600
Let's hope anyway.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.600
I have a good feeling about it.

03:16.600 --> 03:21.600
It's the next morning, let's hope everything survived.

03:21.600 --> 03:29.960
Oh, it looks okay.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.400
These two are broken.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.240
This one's still going good, okay?

03:33.240 --> 03:36.320
Tomatoes are a bit droopy, but still okay.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.920
The beans are a bit droopy too.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.600
Oh no.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.320
Chard looks good, peppers look good.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.840
It looks like most things survived.

03:45.840 --> 03:50.360
That one pea over there doesn't look so good, and two of those cucumbers are dead.

03:50.360 --> 03:56.400
Here we are one week later, and what I said was gonna happen did happen.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.720
That cucumber died.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.720
Everything else looks good.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.960
My four cucumbers are only doing so-so.

04:01.960 --> 04:08.960
This one's completely gone, this one's like half gone, there's one dead plant there, and

04:09.040 --> 04:16.040
there's this one, and this one, and they look okay, but they have the dry edges.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.560
I don't know if that means there's been too much water.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.560
There's been a lot of rain recently, so maybe there's just too much rain hitting these guys.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.800
Oh my god, guys, you need to see this.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.640
You know that I've been fighting with frost and all this this whole year.

04:32.640 --> 04:40.480
It is the 23rd of May, and if you look up here, we have a frost warning again, even

04:40.480 --> 04:43.000
though it's 22 degrees Celsius.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Frost yet again.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.600
Cover up plants, especially those in frost prone areas, of course, of course, of course.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.840
Well guess what, unlike last time when we just put the tarp on, no big deal, check out

04:51.840 --> 04:52.840
the hourly.

04:52.840 --> 04:57.520
It's 22, 21, 19, lovely spring evening.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.560
By 10 p.m. it starts raining, rain, rain, rain, rain.

05:01.560 --> 05:08.280
It gets real cold, and then at about 5 a.m. it goes down to below freezing until 10 a.m.

05:08.280 --> 05:13.480
So I can't even put the tarp on before I go to bed, because the rain will weigh it down

05:13.480 --> 05:15.080
and crush all the plants.

05:15.080 --> 05:20.600
I'm gonna have to get up at 5 a.m. and put the tarp on for this like four to five hour

05:20.600 --> 05:24.240
window to prevent them from getting frosted.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
Fuck my life.

05:25.240 --> 05:35.720
Here we are, it's five in the morning.

05:35.720 --> 05:46.800
Getting the old tarp out yet again, actually, first, it rained a lot last night.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.200
Getting it down again now.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.360
Good morning Naomi, how do you feel?

05:51.360 --> 05:52.360
Fucking awful.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
Yeah, same.

05:53.360 --> 06:00.480
So I was touching the plants and stuff, and like they seem not wet, and I thought they

06:00.480 --> 06:05.960
might be, because I was thinking like if it's just wet from the rain, it's still gonna freeze

06:05.960 --> 06:12.200
whether or not we put a tarp over it, because like rain and then instantly into frost might

06:12.200 --> 06:17.000
just be like the garden's done anyway, I don't know, this still might not work, but I guess

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
we'll see.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
We'll try.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.880
There we go, tarp out again, it is a week before June and we're still getting frost

06:26.880 --> 06:27.880
warnings.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.560
I hope that this is the last time we have to do this.

06:30.560 --> 06:37.600
All right, it's the morning, what a terrible night, and we just noticed part of it blew

06:37.600 --> 06:39.720
over and Naomi, you said they might look frosted?

06:39.720 --> 06:42.320
No, no, I can't tell if they're here.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.320
Let's see.

06:43.320 --> 06:48.320
They seem okay, yeah, I think they're okay.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.640
Well, did they have a fault anyway because that was your side?

06:51.640 --> 06:52.640
Yeah.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.640
Yeah, my side was perfectly fine.

06:55.640 --> 07:02.360
Here, lift it up, and walking forward, walking forward, wait did this pepper die?

07:02.360 --> 07:10.000
It's not dead, it's just bent, stand up straight, it's a little bit floppy, and we gotta do

07:10.000 --> 07:13.680
this again tonight, I think the garden's just not gonna work out this year, there's so much

07:13.680 --> 07:16.200
frost and so much heat at the same time.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
Ready for climate change.

07:18.600 --> 07:23.160
Look how floppy this one is too, I don't know man, this might be, this might be a disaster

07:23.160 --> 07:24.160
this year.

07:24.160 --> 07:29.480
Hey guys, I'm recording from the upstairs window right now and as you can probably hear,

07:29.480 --> 07:35.480
if not see, there's a ton of rain, it's been like this for about two or three days now.

07:35.480 --> 07:39.840
This is not like last year where the rain almost destroyed the garden and it's certainly

07:39.840 --> 07:43.920
not cold enough like earlier in the year where there was a bunch of frost, the temperature

07:43.920 --> 07:48.520
is fine, there's just a lot of water, so I haven't been watering the garden recently.

07:48.520 --> 07:52.080
And to be honest, the rain's actually pretty good because there's a ton of wildfires in

07:52.080 --> 07:54.480
Canada right now, I don't know if you know.

07:54.480 --> 07:58.440
Tomatoes, peppers, and especially chard are all doing very well.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.140
The beans and cucumbers though don't seem to be going anywhere.

08:02.140 --> 08:05.360
It needs some weeding, which I'll do when the storm's passed.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.000
Also it's been a year and I still haven't fixed that.

08:08.080 --> 08:13.280
All right, all that rain's finally done, so it's harvest slash clean up the garden time

08:13.280 --> 08:15.720
because look at all those weeds.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.600
There are weeds everywhere.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.760
In terms of the harvest, oh there's Naomi throwing some right in the camera's way.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.080
Oh, into the bowl too, then we're gonna have to put the harvest in.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.080
Nice, good job.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.080
Thank you.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.320
I hope there's bugs in there for extra protein.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
So...

08:28.320 --> 08:29.640
I didn't eat the bugs.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.800
So we're harvesting the chard now, there's been a lot of chard.

08:32.800 --> 08:39.320
That fifth extra chard that I happened to scavenge actually worked out pretty well.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.240
Everything else though is not necessarily doing the greatest.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.400
Because our weather's been so terrible.

08:45.400 --> 08:50.080
The peppers are about where they usually are at this point in the season, they just take

08:50.080 --> 08:51.160
a while to grow.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.280
Some of the cucumbers are doing okay, but they're also a little bit behind as well.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.800
Same thing with the tomatoes, they're doing all right.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.440
I think they need to have the cages put on them soon though.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.520
And those beans that I bought on a whim, they're mostly just dying.

09:04.520 --> 09:10.040
I don't know what the deal is with the beans, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.620
I guess we'll see how it turns out.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.720
But we've got to harvest, water, and weed.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.840
Naomi, why do you have to weed at the exact spot that the viewing place in the garden

09:16.840 --> 09:17.840
that I have to harvest?

09:17.840 --> 09:19.000
Get out of the way!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.680
I know we had chard last year, but I forget how we did it.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.040
I assume it's just like kale though, you just snip off all the big leaves?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.040
Yeah.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
Yeah, just like so, you just snip-a-roo.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.840
You know, you could look this stuff up.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.240
We'll just figure it out.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
Yeah.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.240
Yeah.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
That works great.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
So, so well.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.240
It does.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
No.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.240
Look, we have a few leaves we can eat.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.040
All right, so the garden is now mostly weeded.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.040
It's not a perfect job, but I mean it's a lot better than it was.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.440
Hey, you hanging out with me?

09:46.440 --> 09:47.440
Yep.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.040
While Naomi grabs this watering can and goes to get some water for the garden.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.040
Is that what I'm doing?

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
Yes.

09:54.040 --> 09:58.080
I'm going to grab these tomato cages and start putting them over the tomatoes because it

09:58.080 --> 09:59.080
is time I think.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.680
Can I come back and pour the water on your head?

10:00.680 --> 10:01.680
No.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
Why not?

10:02.680 --> 10:03.680
Get out of here.

10:03.680 --> 10:04.680
How do you do it?

10:04.680 --> 10:05.680
I never sprayed you with water once during this whole thing.

10:05.680 --> 10:10.680
Now at some point during one of these I'm just going to do it as a surprise when you're

10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
not looking.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.680
And you won't know when I'm going to do it because I'm just going to do it.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
Oh, okay.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.680
You almost fall?

10:17.680 --> 10:18.680
No, I don't.

10:18.680 --> 10:26.680
These look like some something's like cocooning on my tomato cages.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.400
Oh well.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
Let's go.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.200
Is it this one that goes first?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.200
Nope.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.200
Which...

10:33.200 --> 10:34.200
Okay.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
God dammit.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.200
Okay.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.520
I realize I always have tomato cages on the tomatoes.

10:40.520 --> 10:44.440
I never actually show me putting them in though I don't think in any of the videos over the

10:44.440 --> 10:45.440
years.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.440
Not that it matters.

10:46.440 --> 10:55.360
You literally just push them in.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.360
And what happened?

10:56.360 --> 10:57.360
I got sprayed.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.360
Nice.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.560
Thankfully we're going to the beach after this so it doesn't matter.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.760
Let's see if Naomi can actually water plants correctly.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.760
Go!

11:04.760 --> 11:05.760
Oh no!

11:13.760 --> 11:14.760
That's probably enough water yet.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.360
Come on.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.360
Go in.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.640
I'm bending them more than I'm putting them in.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.160
These final two I guess we're just not using them this year.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.160
These tiny ones.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.160
And there we go.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.160
There's our garden.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.160
You know what?

11:32.160 --> 11:35.960
This is one of those times where we might need to just skip the garden for a year.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.760
Because it's going okay but it's not going as well as when it first started.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.560
It could also be because a bunch of these trees grew up in the back here and now we

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
have way less sun.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.560
It could also be because we...

11:44.560 --> 11:46.560
Oh that's a big bug.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
Never mind.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
What were you going to say?

11:48.560 --> 11:49.560
Nothing.

11:49.560 --> 11:50.560
I don't remember.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.560
I got distracted and scared.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.560
Oh fly.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.960
Oh fly.
