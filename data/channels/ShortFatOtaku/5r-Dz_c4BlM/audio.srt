1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,440
What a song to listen to at the start of the day.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
It's Sciitis!

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,800
Alright, so it's 10am, the next batch of plants should have come in, so Naomi and I are going

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,640
to go and hopefully pick up our cucumbers, since that's the last thing that we need to

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
get the garden going.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,400
So Naomi, we're at the store again one week later, there's Naomi's feet, and what kind

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,760
of cucumbers do you want now that they're here?

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,280
English cucumbers, or Japanese cucumbers, no, Lebanese, sorry.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Do you need more tights?

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Ow!

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,280
I thought you just cut myself off.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Regular cucumbers.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Regular cucumbers.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Do you have a preference?

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Nope.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,320
Actually, I think they're pretty much the same.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,640
So we're going to grab four of these and head back home and finish up the planting

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
for this year.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Naomi, the car's a mess again.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,240
It's your fault, stop fucking up my car with your goddamn plants.

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,160
Yeah, but you're still going to eat these cucumbers and like them.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,400
Okay, we're back at the garden, and same situation as last time.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,760
Take a hole, manure time, in it goes.

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,600
Cucumber in it, and then we just bury it up.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,800
Yeah, there we go.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,920
All four cucumbers are in.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,600
Now, the trellis looks no good, but maybe it'll last one more year.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,720
It's still holding together, right?

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,320
And with that, we have basically set the garden up for the year.

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,920
The cucumbers are in, peppers charred because we have too much kale, beans instead of peas

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,960
this year, and the tomatoes.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,920
So, let's see how it all turns out.

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,440
I just saw this guys, oh no, it's frost time.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,400
Take preventative measures to protect frost-sensitive plants.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,640
Alright, so we're here in the middle of the night, and by we I don't mean Naomi this time,

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,880
I mean Dave, fresh off my Garogua playthrough, because Naomi cannot help me with the garden

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,360
right now, as she just had all four of her wisdom teeth pulled, so Dave's stepping in.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Um, where is the tarp?

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Uh, I know we still have it here somewhere.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
So there's gonna be frost tonight, actually I think tomorrow night too, so we gotta get

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,240
the tarp.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,080
Garden looks good, even in the night time.

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,960
So because of the frost, we're gonna put the tarp on, we're gonna take it off tomorrow,

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,480
maybe nine or ten o'clock in the morning, hopefully this will work out.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,080
Hopefully this won't do as poorly as that time when the rain hit.

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:02,400
That was, yeah, about water weight, so there should be some, there's these patio stones

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,280
that are hanging around, you can just get it mostly over the beans, that'll be fine.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,920
Who knows if that'll actually work out, but maybe it will.

49
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
I guess we'll have to see.

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,600
Yeah, this'll probably work out.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Let's hope anyway.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
I have a good feeling about it.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
It's the next morning, let's hope everything survived.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,960
Oh, it looks okay.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,400
These two are broken.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,240
This one's still going good, okay?

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,320
Tomatoes are a bit droopy, but still okay.

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,920
The beans are a bit droopy too.

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,600
Oh no.

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,320
Chard looks good, peppers look good.

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,840
It looks like most things survived.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,360
That one pea over there doesn't look so good, and two of those cucumbers are dead.

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,400
Here we are one week later, and what I said was gonna happen did happen.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
That cucumber died.

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Everything else looks good.

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,960
My four cucumbers are only doing so-so.

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,960
This one's completely gone, this one's like half gone, there's one dead plant there, and

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,040
there's this one, and this one, and they look okay, but they have the dry edges.

69
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,560
I don't know if that means there's been too much water.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
There's been a lot of rain recently, so maybe there's just too much rain hitting these guys.

71
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,800
Oh my god, guys, you need to see this.

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,640
You know that I've been fighting with frost and all this this whole year.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,480
It is the 23rd of May, and if you look up here, we have a frost warning again, even

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,000
though it's 22 degrees Celsius.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Frost yet again.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
Cover up plants, especially those in frost prone areas, of course, of course, of course.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
Well guess what, unlike last time when we just put the tarp on, no big deal, check out

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
the hourly.

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,520
It's 22, 21, 19, lovely spring evening.

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,560
By 10 p.m. it starts raining, rain, rain, rain, rain.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,280
It gets real cold, and then at about 5 a.m. it goes down to below freezing until 10 a.m.

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,480
So I can't even put the tarp on before I go to bed, because the rain will weigh it down

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,080
and crush all the plants.

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm gonna have to get up at 5 a.m. and put the tarp on for this like four to five hour

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,240
window to prevent them from getting frosted.

86
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Fuck my life.

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:35,720
Here we are, it's five in the morning.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Getting the old tarp out yet again, actually, first, it rained a lot last night.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,200
Getting it down again now.

90
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,360
Good morning Naomi, how do you feel?

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Fucking awful.

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Yeah, same.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,480
So I was touching the plants and stuff, and like they seem not wet, and I thought they

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,960
might be, because I was thinking like if it's just wet from the rain, it's still gonna freeze

95
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,200
whether or not we put a tarp over it, because like rain and then instantly into frost might

96
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,000
just be like the garden's done anyway, I don't know, this still might not work, but I guess

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
we'll see.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We'll try.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,880
There we go, tarp out again, it is a week before June and we're still getting frost

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
warnings.

101
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,560
I hope that this is the last time we have to do this.

102
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,600
All right, it's the morning, what a terrible night, and we just noticed part of it blew

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,720
over and Naomi, you said they might look frosted?

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,320
No, no, I can't tell if they're here.

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Let's see.

106
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,320
They seem okay, yeah, I think they're okay.

107
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Well, did they have a fault anyway because that was your side?

108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Yeah.

109
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Yeah, my side was perfectly fine.

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,360
Here, lift it up, and walking forward, walking forward, wait did this pepper die?

111
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not dead, it's just bent, stand up straight, it's a little bit floppy, and we gotta do

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,680
this again tonight, I think the garden's just not gonna work out this year, there's so much

113
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,200
frost and so much heat at the same time.

114
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Ready for climate change.

115
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,160
Look how floppy this one is too, I don't know man, this might be, this might be a disaster

116
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
this year.

117
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,480
Hey guys, I'm recording from the upstairs window right now and as you can probably hear,

118
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,480
if not see, there's a ton of rain, it's been like this for about two or three days now.

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,840
This is not like last year where the rain almost destroyed the garden and it's certainly

120
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,920
not cold enough like earlier in the year where there was a bunch of frost, the temperature

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,520
is fine, there's just a lot of water, so I haven't been watering the garden recently.

122
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,080
And to be honest, the rain's actually pretty good because there's a ton of wildfires in

123
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,480
Canada right now, I don't know if you know.

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,440
Tomatoes, peppers, and especially chard are all doing very well.

125
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,140
The beans and cucumbers though don't seem to be going anywhere.

126
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,360
It needs some weeding, which I'll do when the storm's passed.

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Also it's been a year and I still haven't fixed that.

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,280
All right, all that rain's finally done, so it's harvest slash clean up the garden time

129
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,720
because look at all those weeds.

130
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,600
There are weeds everywhere.

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,760
In terms of the harvest, oh there's Naomi throwing some right in the camera's way.

132
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,080
Oh, into the bowl too, then we're gonna have to put the harvest in.

133
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Nice, good job.

134
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Thank you.

135
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,320
I hope there's bugs in there for extra protein.

136
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
So...

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,640
I didn't eat the bugs.

138
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,800
So we're harvesting the chard now, there's been a lot of chard.

139
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,320
That fifth extra chard that I happened to scavenge actually worked out pretty well.

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,240
Everything else though is not necessarily doing the greatest.

141
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,400
Because our weather's been so terrible.

142
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,080
The peppers are about where they usually are at this point in the season, they just take

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
a while to grow.

144
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,280
Some of the cucumbers are doing okay, but they're also a little bit behind as well.

145
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,800
Same thing with the tomatoes, they're doing all right.

146
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,440
I think they need to have the cages put on them soon though.

147
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,520
And those beans that I bought on a whim, they're mostly just dying.

148
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,040
I don't know what the deal is with the beans, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything.

149
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,620
I guess we'll see how it turns out.

150
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,720
But we've got to harvest, water, and weed.

151
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,840
Naomi, why do you have to weed at the exact spot that the viewing place in the garden

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
that I have to harvest?

153
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
Get out of the way!

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,680
I know we had chard last year, but I forget how we did it.

155
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,040
I assume it's just like kale though, you just snip off all the big leaves?

156
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Yeah.

157
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Yeah, just like so, you just snip-a-roo.

158
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,840
You know, you could look this stuff up.

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
We'll just figure it out.

160
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Yeah.

161
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah.

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
That works great.

163
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
So, so well.

164
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
It does.

165
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
No.

166
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Look, we have a few leaves we can eat.

167
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,040
All right, so the garden is now mostly weeded.

168
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,040
It's not a perfect job, but I mean it's a lot better than it was.

169
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,440
Hey, you hanging out with me?

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Yep.

171
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,040
While Naomi grabs this watering can and goes to get some water for the garden.

172
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Is that what I'm doing?

173
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Yes.

174
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm going to grab these tomato cages and start putting them over the tomatoes because it

175
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
is time I think.

176
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
Can I come back and pour the water on your head?

177
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
No.

178
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Why not?

179
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Get out of here.

180
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
How do you do it?

181
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
I never sprayed you with water once during this whole thing.

182
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Now at some point during one of these I'm just going to do it as a surprise when you're

183
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
not looking.

184
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,680
And you won't know when I'm going to do it because I'm just going to do it.

185
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Oh, okay.

186
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
You almost fall?

187
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
No, I don't.

188
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,680
These look like some something's like cocooning on my tomato cages.

189
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Oh well.

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Let's go.

191
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
Is it this one that goes first?

192
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Nope.

193
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Which...

194
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Okay.

195
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
God dammit.

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Okay.

197
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,520
I realize I always have tomato cages on the tomatoes.

198
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,440
I never actually show me putting them in though I don't think in any of the videos over the

199
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
years.

200
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Not that it matters.

201
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:55,360
You literally just push them in.

202
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
And what happened?

203
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I got sprayed.

204
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Nice.

205
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,560
Thankfully we're going to the beach after this so it doesn't matter.

206
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,760
Let's see if Naomi can actually water plants correctly.

207
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Go!

208
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Oh no!

209
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
That's probably enough water yet.

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Come on.

211
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Go in.

212
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm bending them more than I'm putting them in.

213
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,160
These final two I guess we're just not using them this year.

214
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
These tiny ones.

215
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
And there we go.

216
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
There's our garden.

217
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
You know what?

218
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,960
This is one of those times where we might need to just skip the garden for a year.

219
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,760
Because it's going okay but it's not going as well as when it first started.

220
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,560
It could also be because a bunch of these trees grew up in the back here and now we

221
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
have way less sun.

222
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
It could also be because we...

223
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Oh that's a big bug.

224
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Never mind.

225
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
What were you going to say?

226
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Nothing.

227
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
I don't remember.

228
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
I got distracted and scared.

229
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Oh fly.

230
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,960
Oh fly.
