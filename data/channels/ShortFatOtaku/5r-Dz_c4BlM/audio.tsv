0	12440	What a song to listen to at the start of the day.
12440	13440	It's Sciitis!
13440	18800	Alright, so it's 10am, the next batch of plants should have come in, so Naomi and I are going
18800	24640	to go and hopefully pick up our cucumbers, since that's the last thing that we need to
24640	27840	get the garden going.
27840	34400	So Naomi, we're at the store again one week later, there's Naomi's feet, and what kind
34400	36760	of cucumbers do you want now that they're here?
36760	41280	English cucumbers, or Japanese cucumbers, no, Lebanese, sorry.
41280	43280	Do you need more tights?
43280	44280	Ow!
44280	46280	I thought you just cut myself off.
46280	47280	Regular cucumbers.
47280	48280	Regular cucumbers.
48280	49280	Do you have a preference?
49280	50280	Nope.
50280	52320	Actually, I think they're pretty much the same.
52320	58640	So we're going to grab four of these and head back home and finish up the planting
58640	59640	for this year.
59640	61640	Naomi, the car's a mess again.
61640	65240	It's your fault, stop fucking up my car with your goddamn plants.
65240	68160	Yeah, but you're still going to eat these cucumbers and like them.
68160	73400	Okay, we're back at the garden, and same situation as last time.
73400	78760	Take a hole, manure time, in it goes.
78760	81600	Cucumber in it, and then we just bury it up.
81600	84800	Yeah, there we go.
84800	85920	All four cucumbers are in.
85920	91600	Now, the trellis looks no good, but maybe it'll last one more year.
91600	93720	It's still holding together, right?
93720	98320	And with that, we have basically set the garden up for the year.
98320	103920	The cucumbers are in, peppers charred because we have too much kale, beans instead of peas
103920	105960	this year, and the tomatoes.
105960	108920	So, let's see how it all turns out.
114200	119440	I just saw this guys, oh no, it's frost time.
119440	123400	Take preventative measures to protect frost-sensitive plants.
123400	128640	Alright, so we're here in the middle of the night, and by we I don't mean Naomi this time,
128640	135880	I mean Dave, fresh off my Garogua playthrough, because Naomi cannot help me with the garden
135880	140360	right now, as she just had all four of her wisdom teeth pulled, so Dave's stepping in.
140360	144360	Um, where is the tarp?
144360	149360	Uh, I know we still have it here somewhere.
149360	153280	So there's gonna be frost tonight, actually I think tomorrow night too, so we gotta get
153280	157240	the tarp.
157240	160080	Garden looks good, even in the night time.
160080	162960	So because of the frost, we're gonna put the tarp on, we're gonna take it off tomorrow,
162960	167480	maybe nine or ten o'clock in the morning, hopefully this will work out.
167480	174080	Hopefully this won't do as poorly as that time when the rain hit.
174080	182400	That was, yeah, about water weight, so there should be some, there's these patio stones
182400	187280	that are hanging around, you can just get it mostly over the beans, that'll be fine.
187280	190920	Who knows if that'll actually work out, but maybe it will.
190920	191920	I guess we'll have to see.
191960	193600	Yeah, this'll probably work out.
193600	194600	Let's hope anyway.
194600	196600	I have a good feeling about it.
196600	201600	It's the next morning, let's hope everything survived.
201600	209960	Oh, it looks okay.
209960	211400	These two are broken.
211400	213240	This one's still going good, okay?
213240	216320	Tomatoes are a bit droopy, but still okay.
216320	218920	The beans are a bit droopy too.
218920	220600	Oh no.
220600	223320	Chard looks good, peppers look good.
223320	225840	It looks like most things survived.
225840	230360	That one pea over there doesn't look so good, and two of those cucumbers are dead.
230360	236400	Here we are one week later, and what I said was gonna happen did happen.
236400	238720	That cucumber died.
238720	239720	Everything else looks good.
239720	241960	My four cucumbers are only doing so-so.
241960	248960	This one's completely gone, this one's like half gone, there's one dead plant there, and
249040	256040	there's this one, and this one, and they look okay, but they have the dry edges.
256040	258560	I don't know if that means there's been too much water.
258560	262560	There's been a lot of rain recently, so maybe there's just too much rain hitting these guys.
267880	269800	Oh my god, guys, you need to see this.
269800	272640	You know that I've been fighting with frost and all this this whole year.
272640	280480	It is the 23rd of May, and if you look up here, we have a frost warning again, even
280480	283000	though it's 22 degrees Celsius.
283000	284000	Frost yet again.
284000	287600	Cover up plants, especially those in frost prone areas, of course, of course, of course.
287600	291840	Well guess what, unlike last time when we just put the tarp on, no big deal, check out
291840	292840	the hourly.
292840	297520	It's 22, 21, 19, lovely spring evening.
297520	301560	By 10 p.m. it starts raining, rain, rain, rain, rain.
301560	308280	It gets real cold, and then at about 5 a.m. it goes down to below freezing until 10 a.m.
308280	313480	So I can't even put the tarp on before I go to bed, because the rain will weigh it down
313480	315080	and crush all the plants.
315080	320600	I'm gonna have to get up at 5 a.m. and put the tarp on for this like four to five hour
320600	324240	window to prevent them from getting frosted.
324240	325240	Fuck my life.
325240	335720	Here we are, it's five in the morning.
335720	346800	Getting the old tarp out yet again, actually, first, it rained a lot last night.
346800	349200	Getting it down again now.
349200	351360	Good morning Naomi, how do you feel?
351360	352360	Fucking awful.
352360	353360	Yeah, same.
353360	360480	So I was touching the plants and stuff, and like they seem not wet, and I thought they
360480	365960	might be, because I was thinking like if it's just wet from the rain, it's still gonna freeze
365960	372200	whether or not we put a tarp over it, because like rain and then instantly into frost might
372200	377000	just be like the garden's done anyway, I don't know, this still might not work, but I guess
377000	378000	we'll see.
378000	379000	We'll try.
379000	386880	There we go, tarp out again, it is a week before June and we're still getting frost
386880	387880	warnings.
387880	390560	I hope that this is the last time we have to do this.
390560	397600	All right, it's the morning, what a terrible night, and we just noticed part of it blew
397600	399720	over and Naomi, you said they might look frosted?
399720	402320	No, no, I can't tell if they're here.
402320	403320	Let's see.
403320	408320	They seem okay, yeah, I think they're okay.
408640	411640	Well, did they have a fault anyway because that was your side?
411640	412640	Yeah.
412640	415640	Yeah, my side was perfectly fine.
415640	422360	Here, lift it up, and walking forward, walking forward, wait did this pepper die?
422360	430000	It's not dead, it's just bent, stand up straight, it's a little bit floppy, and we gotta do
430000	433680	this again tonight, I think the garden's just not gonna work out this year, there's so much
433680	436200	frost and so much heat at the same time.
436600	438600	Ready for climate change.
438600	443160	Look how floppy this one is too, I don't know man, this might be, this might be a disaster
443160	444160	this year.
444160	449480	Hey guys, I'm recording from the upstairs window right now and as you can probably hear,
449480	455480	if not see, there's a ton of rain, it's been like this for about two or three days now.
455480	459840	This is not like last year where the rain almost destroyed the garden and it's certainly
459840	463920	not cold enough like earlier in the year where there was a bunch of frost, the temperature
463920	468520	is fine, there's just a lot of water, so I haven't been watering the garden recently.
468520	472080	And to be honest, the rain's actually pretty good because there's a ton of wildfires in
472080	474480	Canada right now, I don't know if you know.
474480	478440	Tomatoes, peppers, and especially chard are all doing very well.
478440	482140	The beans and cucumbers though don't seem to be going anywhere.
482140	485360	It needs some weeding, which I'll do when the storm's passed.
485360	488000	Also it's been a year and I still haven't fixed that.
488080	493280	All right, all that rain's finally done, so it's harvest slash clean up the garden time
493280	495720	because look at all those weeds.
495720	497600	There are weeds everywhere.
497600	500760	In terms of the harvest, oh there's Naomi throwing some right in the camera's way.
500760	503080	Oh, into the bowl too, then we're gonna have to put the harvest in.
503080	504080	Nice, good job.
504080	505080	Thank you.
505080	507320	I hope there's bugs in there for extra protein.
507320	508320	So...
508320	509640	I didn't eat the bugs.
509640	512800	So we're harvesting the chard now, there's been a lot of chard.
512800	519320	That fifth extra chard that I happened to scavenge actually worked out pretty well.
519320	522240	Everything else though is not necessarily doing the greatest.
522240	525400	Because our weather's been so terrible.
525400	530080	The peppers are about where they usually are at this point in the season, they just take
530080	531160	a while to grow.
531160	535280	Some of the cucumbers are doing okay, but they're also a little bit behind as well.
535280	537800	Same thing with the tomatoes, they're doing all right.
537800	540440	I think they need to have the cages put on them soon though.
540440	544520	And those beans that I bought on a whim, they're mostly just dying.
544520	550040	I don't know what the deal is with the beans, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything.
550040	551620	I guess we'll see how it turns out.
551620	553720	But we've got to harvest, water, and weed.
553720	556840	Naomi, why do you have to weed at the exact spot that the viewing place in the garden
556840	557840	that I have to harvest?
557840	559000	Get out of the way!
559000	561680	I know we had chard last year, but I forget how we did it.
561680	564040	I assume it's just like kale though, you just snip off all the big leaves?
564040	565040	Yeah.
565040	567040	Yeah, just like so, you just snip-a-roo.
567040	569840	You know, you could look this stuff up.
570240	572240	We'll just figure it out.
572240	573240	Yeah.
573240	574240	Yeah.
574240	575240	That works great.
575240	576240	So, so well.
576240	577240	It does.
577240	578240	No.
578240	579240	Look, we have a few leaves we can eat.
579240	582040	All right, so the garden is now mostly weeded.
582040	585040	It's not a perfect job, but I mean it's a lot better than it was.
585040	586440	Hey, you hanging out with me?
586440	587440	Yep.
587440	592040	While Naomi grabs this watering can and goes to get some water for the garden.
592040	593040	Is that what I'm doing?
593040	594040	Yes.
594040	598080	I'm going to grab these tomato cages and start putting them over the tomatoes because it
598080	599080	is time I think.
599080	600680	Can I come back and pour the water on your head?
600680	601680	No.
601680	602680	Why not?
602680	603680	Get out of here.
603680	604680	How do you do it?
604680	605680	I never sprayed you with water once during this whole thing.
605680	610680	Now at some point during one of these I'm just going to do it as a surprise when you're
610680	611680	not looking.
611680	615680	And you won't know when I'm going to do it because I'm just going to do it.
615680	616680	Oh, okay.
616680	617680	You almost fall?
617680	618680	No, I don't.
618680	626680	These look like some something's like cocooning on my tomato cages.
626680	628400	Oh well.
628400	629400	Let's go.
629400	631200	Is it this one that goes first?
631200	632200	Nope.
632200	633200	Which...
633200	634200	Okay.
634200	635200	God dammit.
635200	636200	Okay.
636200	640520	I realize I always have tomato cages on the tomatoes.
640520	644440	I never actually show me putting them in though I don't think in any of the videos over the
644440	645440	years.
645440	646440	Not that it matters.
646440	655360	You literally just push them in.
655360	656360	And what happened?
656360	657360	I got sprayed.
657360	658360	Nice.
659320	661560	Thankfully we're going to the beach after this so it doesn't matter.
661560	663760	Let's see if Naomi can actually water plants correctly.
663760	664760	Go!
664760	665760	Oh no!
673760	674760	That's probably enough water yet.
678360	679360	Come on.
679360	680360	Go in.
680360	682640	I'm bending them more than I'm putting them in.
682640	686160	These final two I guess we're just not using them this year.
686160	687160	These tiny ones.
688160	689160	And there we go.
689160	691160	There's our garden.
691160	692160	You know what?
692160	695960	This is one of those times where we might need to just skip the garden for a year.
695960	698760	Because it's going okay but it's not going as well as when it first started.
698760	701560	It could also be because a bunch of these trees grew up in the back here and now we
701560	702560	have way less sun.
702560	704560	It could also be because we...
704560	706560	Oh that's a big bug.
706560	707560	Never mind.
707560	708560	What were you going to say?
708560	709560	Nothing.
709560	710560	I don't remember.
710560	711560	I got distracted and scared.
711560	712560	Oh fly.
712560	713960	Oh fly.
