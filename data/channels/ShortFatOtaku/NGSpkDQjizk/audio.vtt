00:00.000 --> 00:01.480
Let me set the stage for you.

00:01.480 --> 00:06.120
It's January 18th, about 11.30pm, Naomi's tucked away asleep, and I'm working long

00:06.120 --> 00:07.600
into the night on a new video.

00:07.600 --> 00:11.760
1am rolls around, January 19th, as I finish up writing the script.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.040
Satisfied with myself, I decide to goof off a bit on social media.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.600
And that's when I see the trending hashtag, ReleaseTheMemo, on Twitter.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.880
Somebody on Skype even said that it was getting about 30 tweets a second.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.120
Well, I guess my other video is going on the backburner.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.160
What's all this about?

00:25.160 --> 00:29.520
Let's ask Steve King, representing the 4th District of Iowa in Congress.

00:29.520 --> 00:30.560
I have read the memo.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.120
The sickening reality has set in.

00:32.120 --> 00:35.680
I no longer hold out hope that there is an innocent explanation for the information the

00:35.680 --> 00:36.680
public has seen.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.060
I have long said it is worse than Watergate.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.360
It was hashtag NeverTrump and hashtag AlwaysHillary.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.000
Hashtag ReleaseTheMemo.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.480
Here's Representative Jim Jordan.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.480
The American people should be able to read what I did in that briefing room.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.720
It's time to ReleaseTheMemo.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.780
Representative Lee Zeldin.

00:51.780 --> 00:53.520
The American public deserves the truth.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.060
We should not hide the truth from them they've waited too long.

00:56.060 --> 00:57.920
Do not pull a wool over their eyes.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
Show them the facts.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
They deserve nothing less.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.680
And finally, let's listen to Representative Mark Meadows' words on the subject from his

01:03.680 --> 01:04.680
own mouth.

01:04.680 --> 01:10.060
Many of you know we have had a Russia narrative that has been going on because of an infamous

01:10.060 --> 01:12.400
dossier.

01:12.400 --> 01:18.640
And while there's been much reported on it, I can tell you that the Intel Committee has

01:18.640 --> 01:23.960
been fast at work, and Chairman Nunes has been doing outstanding work to get to the

01:23.960 --> 01:26.040
truth for the American people.

01:26.040 --> 01:33.080
Today, I had the opportunity to go into a confidential setting to make sure that what

01:33.080 --> 01:39.480
we can do is understand better what actually took place.

01:39.480 --> 01:47.040
And I'm here to tell all of America tonight that I am shocked to read exactly what has

01:47.040 --> 01:48.080
taken place.

01:48.080 --> 01:54.280
I would think that it would never happen in a country that loves freedom and democracy

01:54.280 --> 01:56.140
like this country.

01:56.140 --> 02:02.640
It is time that we become transparent in all of this and I am calling on our leadership

02:02.640 --> 02:08.040
to make this available so that all Americans can judge for themselves.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.340
Well holy shit, this sounds like it could be big.

02:10.340 --> 02:14.060
Even though we don't necessarily know the contents of this infamous memo just yet, surely

02:14.060 --> 02:16.560
the news is reporting on it, right?

02:16.560 --> 02:17.560
Right?

02:17.560 --> 02:18.560
CNN?

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
MSNBC?

02:19.560 --> 02:20.840
You guys want to talk about it?

02:20.840 --> 02:21.840
No?

02:21.840 --> 02:26.160
You think the anti-Trump resistance is a year old as a more important story?

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
Well okay.

02:27.160 --> 02:31.480
Jesus Christ, I never thought I'd have to go to Fox News for actual fucking reporting.

02:31.480 --> 02:37.200
What I read today in that classified briefing room is as bad as I thought it was, and every

02:37.200 --> 02:41.820
single American citizen should have the ability to see that information to know exactly what

02:41.820 --> 02:43.120
our FBI was up to.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.520
I compared it to, I remember the day I walked in two years ago, on the Benghazi committee,

02:47.520 --> 02:51.040
walked in and saw the immunity agreements that were given to people in the Clinton investigation.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.440
I didn't know who they'd given them to.

02:52.440 --> 02:56.020
I opened up that folder and I looked down and the Justice Department officials slid

02:56.020 --> 03:00.560
that folder over to me on that table and looked down and see they gave Cheryl Mills immunity

03:00.560 --> 03:04.340
during the Clinton investigation, Clinton's chief of staff, her lawyer.

03:04.340 --> 03:07.100
Today when I read the material, I had that same shock feeling.

03:07.100 --> 03:12.740
I was like, wait a minute, this actually happened from our Justice Department and this FBI?

03:12.740 --> 03:13.900
That's how serious this is.

03:13.900 --> 03:19.320
That's why we're calling on every bit of that information we got to see today to be made

03:19.320 --> 03:23.320
public for you to see, for journalists to see, most importantly for the American people

03:23.320 --> 03:24.320
to see.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.360
After Jim and Mark Meadows and many others of us reviewed the intelligence information

03:28.360 --> 03:35.000
today, it is abundantly clear that the entire Mueller investigation is a lie built on a

03:35.000 --> 03:37.240
foundation of corruption.

03:37.240 --> 03:41.720
And what is so important is that we get this information into the public square.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.680
The best disinfectant for this corruption is going to be sunshine.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.680
And that's why Jim Jordan and I have joined many other members of Congress in calling

03:49.680 --> 03:54.480
for this information to be released for the review of all of the American people.

03:54.480 --> 03:59.480
And the key reason that all Americans need to see this memo is that it names names.

03:59.480 --> 04:04.960
It says who was involved with who, how different actors and characters we've heard about interacted

04:04.960 --> 04:05.960
with one another.

04:05.960 --> 04:10.520
And that is the type of information that we need all Americans to see immediately.

04:10.520 --> 04:15.040
So it sounds like some serious underhanded shit went down during the 2016 presidential

04:15.040 --> 04:16.040
election.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.440
And really, most of us have already suspected this to be the case for a while now.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.160
But if this is actually true and there's actually evidence for it now, it's no wonder

04:23.160 --> 04:25.840
that the Release the Memo hashtag started trending so quickly.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.240
Oh, how nice of you to purge the trending list by the next morning, Twitter.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.840
Can't let any wrong thing disseminate to the citizens, eh?

04:31.840 --> 04:36.040
Oh, you're also going to ban the official Twitter account of the United States House

04:36.040 --> 04:39.960
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the section of government that revealed the

04:39.960 --> 04:41.160
classified memo to Congress?

04:41.160 --> 04:42.520
Yeah, that's a good idea.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.000
Plug up that dam with your thumb, Twitter, and it'll all work out.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.040
Hillary's still got a pass at the White House.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.000
Okay, okay, enough goofing around.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.460
Let's get to the heart of the issue.

04:50.460 --> 04:54.880
You all know I'm not a huge fan of Ben Shapiro generally, but so far, his article titled

04:54.880 --> 04:59.800
Release the Memo Trends as Republicans call for releasing a shocking classified memo showing

04:59.800 --> 05:04.280
FISSA abuses in Russian collusion investigation seems to be the only mainstream take on the

05:04.280 --> 05:05.280
topic so far.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.960
Shapiro writes, So, what could be in the memo?

05:07.960 --> 05:12.300
An educated guess would suggest that the memo shows that the FBI initiated its investigation

05:12.300 --> 05:16.980
based on the so-called Steele dossier, a compendium of opposition research compiled

05:16.980 --> 05:20.700
by Fusion GPS on the instructions of the Democratic National Committee.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.840
If it is indeed the case that FISSA warrants were requested on the basis of DNC funded

05:24.840 --> 05:28.940
opposition research, that would appear to politicize the FBI in serious ways.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.620
Let's define some of the players here.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.920
We all know who the FBI is, the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.340
Under James Comey, the Bureau handled both the investigation into Hillary Clinton's

05:37.340 --> 05:41.060
email server during the 2016 election, and later the possibility of Russian interference

05:41.060 --> 05:43.120
in the election in 2017.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.020
President Donald Trump sacked Comey on May 9, 2017.

05:46.020 --> 05:49.520
There's some confusion surrounding Comey's dismissal, with Trump supporters believing

05:49.520 --> 05:53.540
that Comey was let go due to the reasons that Trump gave publicly, that Comey just wasn't

05:53.540 --> 05:57.500
doing a good job and that Trump was acting on the recommendations of his senior staff,

05:57.500 --> 06:00.720
while others believe that Trump was trying to cover up collusion between his campaign

06:00.720 --> 06:02.000
and the Russian government.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.740
But nonetheless, the investigation continued on, with The Independent publishing an article

06:05.740 --> 06:09.400
stating that Robert Mueller, who is now in charge of the investigation, apparently has

06:09.400 --> 06:12.960
enough evidence to bring criminal charges against Trump's former National Security

06:12.960 --> 06:16.060
Advisor, Michael Flynn, due to these Russian connections.

06:16.060 --> 06:19.900
Mr. Flynn resigned in February after just 24 days in the role when it emerged he had

06:19.900 --> 06:23.540
lied to administration officials, including Mike Pence, the Vice President, about his

06:23.540 --> 06:25.820
communications with representatives of the Russian government.

06:25.820 --> 06:29.180
FISSA warrants refers to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.420
This is pretty straightforward.

06:30.420 --> 06:34.620
If the FBI requested a warrant for foreign surveillance on the basis of evidence provided

06:34.620 --> 06:39.500
by DNC-funded partisan research, Shapiro is right when he states that the FBI has become

06:39.500 --> 06:41.640
biased toward one political party.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.280
Trump has spoken about the FISSA Act recently as well, predictably through Twitter.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.660
House votes on controversial FISSA Act today.

06:47.660 --> 06:51.840
This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony dossier,

06:51.840 --> 06:56.680
to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump campaign by the previous administration and others.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.840
Disproven and paid for by Democrats.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.280
Dossier used a spy on Trump campaign.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.080
Did FBI use Intel Tool to influence the election?

07:04.080 --> 07:06.700
Did Dems or Clinton also pay the Russians?

07:06.700 --> 07:09.140
Where are the hidden and smashed DNC servers?

07:09.140 --> 07:10.700
Where are crooked Hillary emails?

07:10.700 --> 07:11.700
What a mess.

07:11.700 --> 07:15.620
The long-standing position of Trump's administration is that the Obama administration wiretapped

07:15.620 --> 07:19.660
Trump Tower in an effort to unearth evidence of Russian collusion, and may have broken

07:19.660 --> 07:20.920
the law in doing so.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.820
The memo is referred to in the Release the Memo hashtag, sounds like they may actually

07:24.820 --> 07:27.100
contain evidence proving this to be the case.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.900
Well, what is this DNC-funded opposition research that the FBI apparently used as its basis

07:31.900 --> 07:33.140
for a FISSA warrant?

07:33.140 --> 07:36.520
That would be the Steele dossier, and we all know this document quite well.

07:36.520 --> 07:41.400
It's that ridiculous Donald Trump fanfiction from 2016 alleging that Trump went on a hooker-fuelled

07:41.400 --> 07:46.040
binge in Moscow that was pretty clearly fake from the get-go, and that only Buzzfeed decided

07:46.040 --> 07:48.440
to publish because Buzzfeed is a piss rag.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.940
Mark Alias, an attorney of record for the Democratic National Committee and a part of

07:51.940 --> 07:57.120
Hillary Clinton's campaign, hired the company Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.800
Fusion GPS, in turn, hired the British intelligence firm Orbis Business Intelligence.

08:01.800 --> 08:07.500
Orbis' co-founder Christopher Steele, a retired MI6 officer, compiled the Steele dossier,

08:07.500 --> 08:11.520
and eventually passed it on to not only his clients, but the American and British governments.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.380
On the one hand, Steele has a long history of quality and integrity in his work, and

08:15.380 --> 08:17.980
the dossier does include some troubling allegations.

08:17.980 --> 08:21.620
On the other hand, the dossier also alleges that Trump requested a room in a hotel that

08:21.620 --> 08:24.900
Obama specifically stayed in and hired hookers to piss on the bed.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.780
There's obvious problems right from the get-go if the FBI took the Trump piss orgy

08:28.780 --> 08:30.100
story seriously.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.080
But more importantly, the Steele dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee

08:34.080 --> 08:35.480
and Hillary's campaign.

08:35.480 --> 08:40.560
The FBI's obligation to be an apolitical organization has been violated if the FBI

08:40.560 --> 08:44.560
used the Steele dossier to obtain the FISA warrants necessary to act against Trump's

08:44.560 --> 08:48.600
campaign, considering that the Steele dossier was entirely funded by Hillary's campaign.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.440
Like Trump said in his tweets, an extension of the controversial FISA act was voted on

08:52.440 --> 08:56.800
recently, and now those papers sit on Trump's desk, waiting for either a verification or

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
a veto.

08:57.800 --> 09:02.040
If hashtag release the memo's fear is to be believed, then the FISA act has clearly

09:02.040 --> 09:03.540
been abused.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.540
Against Trump.

09:04.540 --> 09:08.500
In my opinion, if we see a Trump veto, that's likely another sign that whatever is contained

09:08.500 --> 09:10.860
within the memo is both legitimate and serious.

09:10.860 --> 09:15.220
Oh hey, while I was writing this script, both the Washington Times and the Business Insider

09:15.220 --> 09:17.900
decided to publish stories on hashtag release the memo.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.980
Finally, some mainstream media coverage.

09:19.980 --> 09:23.300
I wonder if it's going to actually address the issues or just blame everything on the

09:23.300 --> 09:24.300
Russians.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.620
Interest in the classified House Intelligence Committee memo, which reportedly outlines

09:27.620 --> 09:31.400
how the anti-Trump dossier was used by the FBI to justify surveillance against Donald

09:31.400 --> 09:34.440
Trump's presidential campaign, has caused an online frenzy.

09:34.440 --> 09:39.240
Last Thursday, WikiLeaks jumped into the proceedings, offering a reward of up to $1 million to anyone

09:39.240 --> 09:40.520
who could send them a copy.

09:40.520 --> 09:44.900
Meanwhile, reports emerged that the Twitter hashtag calling for the memo's public release,

09:44.900 --> 09:49.120
hashtag release the memo, was receiving a major online push by Russian-linked Twitter

09:49.120 --> 09:50.120
accounts.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.840
Yeah, I think we all saw that one coming.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.880
Guys, I guess we're all just Russian Twitter accounts.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.600
I'll just have to go get my Canadian birth certificate and passport switched over.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.660
On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines to release the FISA

10:01.660 --> 10:02.660
abuse memo.

10:02.660 --> 10:06.620
According to sources close to the committee, it addresses text messages between FBI agent

10:06.620 --> 10:11.420
Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, which proved the dossier was used to justify FISA

10:11.420 --> 10:12.420
warrants.

10:12.420 --> 10:15.020
Well, the Republicans wanted Congress to see the memo and the Democrats didn't.

10:15.020 --> 10:18.940
That's no surprise, considering that the memo would indict the Clinton campaign, the

10:18.940 --> 10:20.660
FBI, and Obama's White House.

10:20.660 --> 10:24.680
A Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, described the memo as a profoundly misleading

10:24.680 --> 10:29.120
set of talking points drafted by Republican staff attacking the FBI, and that it was rife

10:29.120 --> 10:33.420
with factual inaccuracies and referencing highly classified materials that most of Republican

10:33.420 --> 10:36.780
Intelligence Committee members were forced to acknowledge they had never read.

10:36.780 --> 10:39.940
Okay, so the Democratic position is that the memo is just false.

10:39.940 --> 10:40.940
That's fine.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.660
But if that's the case, then why did the rest of the Democrats in Congress refuse to

10:44.660 --> 10:47.660
even view the memo with their Republican counterparts?

10:47.660 --> 10:52.440
What's interesting is that this morning the Democrats decided to vote against releasing

10:52.440 --> 10:53.440
this memo.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.800
That's number one.

10:54.800 --> 10:59.880
Number two, when I was in the room, and I've heard from other members of Congress, when

10:59.880 --> 11:04.660
they were in the room, there were no Democrats who actually came down to look at this memo.

11:04.660 --> 11:10.300
So they were so interested in the Russia collusion story until their Russia collusion story actually

11:10.300 --> 11:12.500
started unraveling.

11:12.500 --> 11:17.080
So now that we have some information that is being provided to every member of the House,

11:17.080 --> 11:20.340
they are unwilling to release it or to even look at it.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.480
I mean, if it's fake, there's no harm, right?

11:22.480 --> 11:25.320
Come on, I thought you guys cared about Russia, don't you want to see the evidence?

11:25.320 --> 11:29.820
Why hasn't some Democratic small fry in Congress leaked it to CNN yet, like every other scrap

11:29.820 --> 11:31.640
of Russian news in the past year?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.960
Maybe it's because the memo actually vindicates Trump.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.900
Maybe it paints Obama or Hillary in an exceptionally bad light.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.900
Those who have seen the memo have said that people may go to jail over this.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.620
And if you think it's a bit conspiratorial to link Obama to all of this, let me remind

11:43.620 --> 11:47.900
you of this 2014 interview of Democratic Congressman Maxine Waters.

12:13.620 --> 12:20.860
An organization that contains the kind of database that no one has ever seen before

12:20.860 --> 12:22.100
in life.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.100
That's going to be very, very powerful.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.100
And whoever-

12:25.100 --> 12:28.260
In terms of the organizing for America, that he's now shifting to become a 501c4.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.260
That's right.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.260
That's right.

12:30.260 --> 12:36.180
And that database will have information about everything on every individual in ways that

12:36.180 --> 12:37.720
it's never been done before.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.100
And whoever runs for president on the Democratic ticket have to deal with that.

12:42.100 --> 12:46.500
They're going to have to go down with that database and the concerns of those people

12:46.500 --> 12:49.300
because they can't get around it.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.300
And he's been very smart.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.380
I mean, it's very powerful what he's leaving in place.

12:53.380 --> 12:56.900
And I think that's what any Democratic candidate is going to have to deal with.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.340
We have two positions here, two big questions.

12:59.340 --> 13:02.900
The Democrats are asking, was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian

13:02.900 --> 13:03.900
government?

13:03.900 --> 13:07.000
And is there currently collusion between the Trump administration and the Russian government?

13:07.000 --> 13:11.460
The Republicans are asking, did Obama's FBI dress up Clinton campaign funded research

13:11.460 --> 13:15.660
from Fusing GPS to look like an intelligence document in order to justify spying on the

13:15.660 --> 13:17.620
Trump campaign using the FISA act?

13:17.620 --> 13:20.580
These two questions have been kicked back and forth for a while now.

13:20.580 --> 13:23.180
But the answer to both of them is in the memo.

13:23.180 --> 13:26.840
And it's telling that the Republicans want it released while the Democrats do not.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.900
That Washington Post article from earlier stated that the memo could be released next

13:30.900 --> 13:33.180
week provided that the White House does not object.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.300
And let's hope that Trump doesn't object.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.500
This is David Nunez.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.200
He's been working on the memo for the past four months.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.660
Maybe its contents are fake.

13:40.660 --> 13:41.660
Maybe they're not.

13:41.660 --> 13:43.840
We'll only know when we can see the memo for ourselves.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.580
Maybe the memo is just a big fat distraction from the upcoming government shutdown.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.940
And Republicans, please stop whining about it.

13:49.940 --> 13:54.260
Your party also took on the role of an obstructionist when you attempted to shut down Obama's government

13:54.260 --> 13:55.260
as well.

13:55.260 --> 13:59.660
Or maybe the memo is real and the Democrats are throwing up as many roadblocks and distractions

13:59.660 --> 14:02.260
as they can in order to protect their star players.

14:02.260 --> 14:06.820
Hell, maybe the shutdown is a stratagem designed to prevent a congressional vote on the memo's

14:06.820 --> 14:07.820
release.

14:07.820 --> 14:10.340
I'll leave you with a Hillary Clinton quote directed to Donna Brazile.

14:10.340 --> 14:13.260
If that fucking bastard wins, we all hang from nooses.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.260
Lauer's finished.

14:14.260 --> 14:17.380
And if I lose, it's on all your heads for screwing up.

14:17.380 --> 14:21.060
You'd better fix this shit.

14:21.060 --> 14:30.620
The American people deserve, they must, they want to know what's in this document.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.820
Release the memo.

14:32.820 --> 14:39.500
Release the memo and all of the related materials sourced in the memo.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.060
Release the file.

14:42.060 --> 14:48.840
There's no concern there should not be for compromising any good sources and methods

14:48.840 --> 14:54.560
by releasing the memo and releasing the file.

14:54.560 --> 15:00.220
What it would reveal is the Fed's reliance on bad sources and methods.
