0	1480	Let me set the stage for you.
1480	6120	It's January 18th, about 11.30pm, Naomi's tucked away asleep, and I'm working long
6120	7600	into the night on a new video.
7600	11760	1am rolls around, January 19th, as I finish up writing the script.
11760	15040	Satisfied with myself, I decide to goof off a bit on social media.
15040	18600	And that's when I see the trending hashtag, ReleaseTheMemo, on Twitter.
18600	21880	Somebody on Skype even said that it was getting about 30 tweets a second.
21880	24120	Well, I guess my other video is going on the backburner.
24120	25160	What's all this about?
25160	29520	Let's ask Steve King, representing the 4th District of Iowa in Congress.
29520	30560	I have read the memo.
30560	32120	The sickening reality has set in.
32120	35680	I no longer hold out hope that there is an innocent explanation for the information the
35680	36680	public has seen.
36680	39060	I have long said it is worse than Watergate.
39060	42360	It was hashtag NeverTrump and hashtag AlwaysHillary.
42360	44000	Hashtag ReleaseTheMemo.
44000	45480	Here's Representative Jim Jordan.
45480	48480	The American people should be able to read what I did in that briefing room.
48480	50720	It's time to ReleaseTheMemo.
50720	51780	Representative Lee Zeldin.
51780	53520	The American public deserves the truth.
53520	56060	We should not hide the truth from them they've waited too long.
56060	57920	Do not pull a wool over their eyes.
57920	58920	Show them the facts.
59320	60320	They deserve nothing less.
60320	63680	And finally, let's listen to Representative Mark Meadows' words on the subject from his
63680	64680	own mouth.
64680	70060	Many of you know we have had a Russia narrative that has been going on because of an infamous
70060	72400	dossier.
72400	78640	And while there's been much reported on it, I can tell you that the Intel Committee has
78640	83960	been fast at work, and Chairman Nunes has been doing outstanding work to get to the
83960	86040	truth for the American people.
86040	93080	Today, I had the opportunity to go into a confidential setting to make sure that what
93080	99480	we can do is understand better what actually took place.
99480	107040	And I'm here to tell all of America tonight that I am shocked to read exactly what has
107040	108080	taken place.
108080	114280	I would think that it would never happen in a country that loves freedom and democracy
114280	116140	like this country.
116140	122640	It is time that we become transparent in all of this and I am calling on our leadership
122640	128040	to make this available so that all Americans can judge for themselves.
128040	130340	Well holy shit, this sounds like it could be big.
130340	134060	Even though we don't necessarily know the contents of this infamous memo just yet, surely
134060	136560	the news is reporting on it, right?
136560	137560	Right?
137560	138560	CNN?
138560	139560	MSNBC?
139560	140840	You guys want to talk about it?
140840	141840	No?
141840	146160	You think the anti-Trump resistance is a year old as a more important story?
146160	147160	Well okay.
147160	151480	Jesus Christ, I never thought I'd have to go to Fox News for actual fucking reporting.
151480	157200	What I read today in that classified briefing room is as bad as I thought it was, and every
157200	161820	single American citizen should have the ability to see that information to know exactly what
161820	163120	our FBI was up to.
163120	167520	I compared it to, I remember the day I walked in two years ago, on the Benghazi committee,
167520	171040	walked in and saw the immunity agreements that were given to people in the Clinton investigation.
171040	172440	I didn't know who they'd given them to.
172440	176020	I opened up that folder and I looked down and the Justice Department officials slid
176020	180560	that folder over to me on that table and looked down and see they gave Cheryl Mills immunity
180560	184340	during the Clinton investigation, Clinton's chief of staff, her lawyer.
184340	187100	Today when I read the material, I had that same shock feeling.
187100	192740	I was like, wait a minute, this actually happened from our Justice Department and this FBI?
192740	193900	That's how serious this is.
193900	199320	That's why we're calling on every bit of that information we got to see today to be made
199320	203320	public for you to see, for journalists to see, most importantly for the American people
203320	204320	to see.
204320	208360	After Jim and Mark Meadows and many others of us reviewed the intelligence information
208360	215000	today, it is abundantly clear that the entire Mueller investigation is a lie built on a
215000	217240	foundation of corruption.
217240	221720	And what is so important is that we get this information into the public square.
221720	225680	The best disinfectant for this corruption is going to be sunshine.
225680	229680	And that's why Jim Jordan and I have joined many other members of Congress in calling
229680	234480	for this information to be released for the review of all of the American people.
234480	239480	And the key reason that all Americans need to see this memo is that it names names.
239480	244960	It says who was involved with who, how different actors and characters we've heard about interacted
244960	245960	with one another.
245960	250520	And that is the type of information that we need all Americans to see immediately.
250520	255040	So it sounds like some serious underhanded shit went down during the 2016 presidential
255040	256040	election.
256040	259440	And really, most of us have already suspected this to be the case for a while now.
259440	263160	But if this is actually true and there's actually evidence for it now, it's no wonder
263160	265840	that the Release the Memo hashtag started trending so quickly.
265840	269240	Oh, how nice of you to purge the trending list by the next morning, Twitter.
269240	271840	Can't let any wrong thing disseminate to the citizens, eh?
271840	276040	Oh, you're also going to ban the official Twitter account of the United States House
276040	279960	Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the section of government that revealed the
279960	281160	classified memo to Congress?
281160	282520	Yeah, that's a good idea.
282520	285000	Plug up that dam with your thumb, Twitter, and it'll all work out.
285000	287040	Hillary's still got a pass at the White House.
287040	289000	Okay, okay, enough goofing around.
289000	290460	Let's get to the heart of the issue.
290460	294880	You all know I'm not a huge fan of Ben Shapiro generally, but so far, his article titled
294880	299800	Release the Memo Trends as Republicans call for releasing a shocking classified memo showing
299800	304280	FISSA abuses in Russian collusion investigation seems to be the only mainstream take on the
304280	305280	topic so far.
305280	307960	Shapiro writes, So, what could be in the memo?
307960	312300	An educated guess would suggest that the memo shows that the FBI initiated its investigation
312300	316980	based on the so-called Steele dossier, a compendium of opposition research compiled
316980	320700	by Fusion GPS on the instructions of the Democratic National Committee.
320700	324840	If it is indeed the case that FISSA warrants were requested on the basis of DNC funded
324840	328940	opposition research, that would appear to politicize the FBI in serious ways.
328940	330620	Let's define some of the players here.
330620	333920	We all know who the FBI is, the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
333920	337340	Under James Comey, the Bureau handled both the investigation into Hillary Clinton's
337340	341060	email server during the 2016 election, and later the possibility of Russian interference
341060	343120	in the election in 2017.
343120	346020	President Donald Trump sacked Comey on May 9, 2017.
346020	349520	There's some confusion surrounding Comey's dismissal, with Trump supporters believing
349520	353540	that Comey was let go due to the reasons that Trump gave publicly, that Comey just wasn't
353540	357500	doing a good job and that Trump was acting on the recommendations of his senior staff,
357500	360720	while others believe that Trump was trying to cover up collusion between his campaign
360720	362000	and the Russian government.
362000	365740	But nonetheless, the investigation continued on, with The Independent publishing an article
365740	369400	stating that Robert Mueller, who is now in charge of the investigation, apparently has
369400	372960	enough evidence to bring criminal charges against Trump's former National Security
372960	376060	Advisor, Michael Flynn, due to these Russian connections.
376060	379900	Mr. Flynn resigned in February after just 24 days in the role when it emerged he had
379900	383540	lied to administration officials, including Mike Pence, the Vice President, about his
383540	385820	communications with representatives of the Russian government.
385820	389180	FISSA warrants refers to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
389180	390420	This is pretty straightforward.
390420	394620	If the FBI requested a warrant for foreign surveillance on the basis of evidence provided
394620	399500	by DNC-funded partisan research, Shapiro is right when he states that the FBI has become
399500	401640	biased toward one political party.
401640	405280	Trump has spoken about the FISSA Act recently as well, predictably through Twitter.
405280	407660	House votes on controversial FISSA Act today.
407660	411840	This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony dossier,
411840	416680	to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump campaign by the previous administration and others.
416680	418840	Disproven and paid for by Democrats.
418840	421280	Dossier used a spy on Trump campaign.
421280	424080	Did FBI use Intel Tool to influence the election?
424080	426700	Did Dems or Clinton also pay the Russians?
426700	429140	Where are the hidden and smashed DNC servers?
429140	430700	Where are crooked Hillary emails?
430700	431700	What a mess.
431700	435620	The long-standing position of Trump's administration is that the Obama administration wiretapped
435620	439660	Trump Tower in an effort to unearth evidence of Russian collusion, and may have broken
439660	440920	the law in doing so.
440920	444820	The memo is referred to in the Release the Memo hashtag, sounds like they may actually
444820	447100	contain evidence proving this to be the case.
447100	451900	Well, what is this DNC-funded opposition research that the FBI apparently used as its basis
451900	453140	for a FISSA warrant?
453140	456520	That would be the Steele dossier, and we all know this document quite well.
456520	461400	It's that ridiculous Donald Trump fanfiction from 2016 alleging that Trump went on a hooker-fuelled
461400	466040	binge in Moscow that was pretty clearly fake from the get-go, and that only Buzzfeed decided
466040	468440	to publish because Buzzfeed is a piss rag.
468440	471940	Mark Alias, an attorney of record for the Democratic National Committee and a part of
471940	477120	Hillary Clinton's campaign, hired the company Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.
477120	481800	Fusion GPS, in turn, hired the British intelligence firm Orbis Business Intelligence.
481800	487500	Orbis' co-founder Christopher Steele, a retired MI6 officer, compiled the Steele dossier,
487500	491520	and eventually passed it on to not only his clients, but the American and British governments.
491520	495380	On the one hand, Steele has a long history of quality and integrity in his work, and
495380	497980	the dossier does include some troubling allegations.
497980	501620	On the other hand, the dossier also alleges that Trump requested a room in a hotel that
501620	504900	Obama specifically stayed in and hired hookers to piss on the bed.
504900	508780	There's obvious problems right from the get-go if the FBI took the Trump piss orgy
508780	510100	story seriously.
510100	514080	But more importantly, the Steele dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee
514080	515480	and Hillary's campaign.
515480	520560	The FBI's obligation to be an apolitical organization has been violated if the FBI
520560	524560	used the Steele dossier to obtain the FISA warrants necessary to act against Trump's
524560	528600	campaign, considering that the Steele dossier was entirely funded by Hillary's campaign.
528600	532440	Like Trump said in his tweets, an extension of the controversial FISA act was voted on
532440	536800	recently, and now those papers sit on Trump's desk, waiting for either a verification or
536800	537800	a veto.
537800	542040	If hashtag release the memo's fear is to be believed, then the FISA act has clearly
542040	543540	been abused.
543540	544540	Against Trump.
544540	548500	In my opinion, if we see a Trump veto, that's likely another sign that whatever is contained
548500	550860	within the memo is both legitimate and serious.
550860	555220	Oh hey, while I was writing this script, both the Washington Times and the Business Insider
555220	557900	decided to publish stories on hashtag release the memo.
557900	559980	Finally, some mainstream media coverage.
559980	563300	I wonder if it's going to actually address the issues or just blame everything on the
563300	564300	Russians.
564300	567620	Interest in the classified House Intelligence Committee memo, which reportedly outlines
567620	571400	how the anti-Trump dossier was used by the FBI to justify surveillance against Donald
571400	574440	Trump's presidential campaign, has caused an online frenzy.
574440	579240	Last Thursday, WikiLeaks jumped into the proceedings, offering a reward of up to $1 million to anyone
579240	580520	who could send them a copy.
580520	584900	Meanwhile, reports emerged that the Twitter hashtag calling for the memo's public release,
584900	589120	hashtag release the memo, was receiving a major online push by Russian-linked Twitter
589120	590120	accounts.
590120	591840	Yeah, I think we all saw that one coming.
591840	593880	Guys, I guess we're all just Russian Twitter accounts.
593880	597600	I'll just have to go get my Canadian birth certificate and passport switched over.
597600	601660	On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines to release the FISA
601660	602660	abuse memo.
602660	606620	According to sources close to the committee, it addresses text messages between FBI agent
606620	611420	Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, which proved the dossier was used to justify FISA
611420	612420	warrants.
612420	615020	Well, the Republicans wanted Congress to see the memo and the Democrats didn't.
615020	618940	That's no surprise, considering that the memo would indict the Clinton campaign, the
618940	620660	FBI, and Obama's White House.
620660	624680	A Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, described the memo as a profoundly misleading
624680	629120	set of talking points drafted by Republican staff attacking the FBI, and that it was rife
629120	633420	with factual inaccuracies and referencing highly classified materials that most of Republican
633420	636780	Intelligence Committee members were forced to acknowledge they had never read.
636780	639940	Okay, so the Democratic position is that the memo is just false.
639940	640940	That's fine.
640940	644660	But if that's the case, then why did the rest of the Democrats in Congress refuse to
644660	647660	even view the memo with their Republican counterparts?
647660	652440	What's interesting is that this morning the Democrats decided to vote against releasing
652440	653440	this memo.
653440	654800	That's number one.
654800	659880	Number two, when I was in the room, and I've heard from other members of Congress, when
659880	664660	they were in the room, there were no Democrats who actually came down to look at this memo.
664660	670300	So they were so interested in the Russia collusion story until their Russia collusion story actually
670300	672500	started unraveling.
672500	677080	So now that we have some information that is being provided to every member of the House,
677080	680340	they are unwilling to release it or to even look at it.
680340	682480	I mean, if it's fake, there's no harm, right?
682480	685320	Come on, I thought you guys cared about Russia, don't you want to see the evidence?
685320	689820	Why hasn't some Democratic small fry in Congress leaked it to CNN yet, like every other scrap
689820	691640	of Russian news in the past year?
691640	693960	Maybe it's because the memo actually vindicates Trump.
693960	696900	Maybe it paints Obama or Hillary in an exceptionally bad light.
696900	699900	Those who have seen the memo have said that people may go to jail over this.
699900	703620	And if you think it's a bit conspiratorial to link Obama to all of this, let me remind
703620	707900	you of this 2014 interview of Democratic Congressman Maxine Waters.
733620	740860	An organization that contains the kind of database that no one has ever seen before
740860	742100	in life.
742100	744100	That's going to be very, very powerful.
744100	745100	And whoever-
745100	748260	In terms of the organizing for America, that he's now shifting to become a 501c4.
748260	749260	That's right.
749260	750260	That's right.
750260	756180	And that database will have information about everything on every individual in ways that
756180	757720	it's never been done before.
757720	762100	And whoever runs for president on the Democratic ticket have to deal with that.
762100	766500	They're going to have to go down with that database and the concerns of those people
766500	769300	because they can't get around it.
769300	770300	And he's been very smart.
770300	773380	I mean, it's very powerful what he's leaving in place.
773380	776900	And I think that's what any Democratic candidate is going to have to deal with.
776900	779340	We have two positions here, two big questions.
779340	782900	The Democrats are asking, was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian
782900	783900	government?
783900	787000	And is there currently collusion between the Trump administration and the Russian government?
787000	791460	The Republicans are asking, did Obama's FBI dress up Clinton campaign funded research
791460	795660	from Fusing GPS to look like an intelligence document in order to justify spying on the
795660	797620	Trump campaign using the FISA act?
797620	800580	These two questions have been kicked back and forth for a while now.
800580	803180	But the answer to both of them is in the memo.
803180	806840	And it's telling that the Republicans want it released while the Democrats do not.
806840	810900	That Washington Post article from earlier stated that the memo could be released next
810900	813180	week provided that the White House does not object.
813180	815300	And let's hope that Trump doesn't object.
815300	816500	This is David Nunez.
816500	819200	He's been working on the memo for the past four months.
819200	820660	Maybe its contents are fake.
820660	821660	Maybe they're not.
821660	823840	We'll only know when we can see the memo for ourselves.
823840	827580	Maybe the memo is just a big fat distraction from the upcoming government shutdown.
827580	829940	And Republicans, please stop whining about it.
829940	834260	Your party also took on the role of an obstructionist when you attempted to shut down Obama's government
834260	835260	as well.
835260	839660	Or maybe the memo is real and the Democrats are throwing up as many roadblocks and distractions
839660	842260	as they can in order to protect their star players.
842260	846820	Hell, maybe the shutdown is a stratagem designed to prevent a congressional vote on the memo's
846820	847820	release.
847820	850340	I'll leave you with a Hillary Clinton quote directed to Donna Brazile.
850340	853260	If that fucking bastard wins, we all hang from nooses.
853260	854260	Lauer's finished.
854260	857380	And if I lose, it's on all your heads for screwing up.
857380	861060	You'd better fix this shit.
861060	870620	The American people deserve, they must, they want to know what's in this document.
870620	872820	Release the memo.
872820	879500	Release the memo and all of the related materials sourced in the memo.
879500	882060	Release the file.
882060	888840	There's no concern there should not be for compromising any good sources and methods
888840	894560	by releasing the memo and releasing the file.
894560	900220	What it would reveal is the Fed's reliance on bad sources and methods.
