1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
Let me set the stage for you.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,120
It's January 18th, about 11.30pm, Naomi's tucked away asleep, and I'm working long

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,600
into the night on a new video.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,760
1am rolls around, January 19th, as I finish up writing the script.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,040
Satisfied with myself, I decide to goof off a bit on social media.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,600
And that's when I see the trending hashtag, ReleaseTheMemo, on Twitter.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,880
Somebody on Skype even said that it was getting about 30 tweets a second.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,120
Well, I guess my other video is going on the backburner.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,160
What's all this about?

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,520
Let's ask Steve King, representing the 4th District of Iowa in Congress.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,560
I have read the memo.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,120
The sickening reality has set in.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,680
I no longer hold out hope that there is an innocent explanation for the information the

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
public has seen.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,060
I have long said it is worse than Watergate.

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,360
It was hashtag NeverTrump and hashtag AlwaysHillary.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,000
Hashtag ReleaseTheMemo.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,480
Here's Representative Jim Jordan.

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,480
The American people should be able to read what I did in that briefing room.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,720
It's time to ReleaseTheMemo.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,780
Representative Lee Zeldin.

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,520
The American public deserves the truth.

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,060
We should not hide the truth from them they've waited too long.

24
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,920
Do not pull a wool over their eyes.

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Show them the facts.

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
They deserve nothing less.

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
And finally, let's listen to Representative Mark Meadows' words on the subject from his

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
own mouth.

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,060
Many of you know we have had a Russia narrative that has been going on because of an infamous

30
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,400
dossier.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,640
And while there's been much reported on it, I can tell you that the Intel Committee has

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,960
been fast at work, and Chairman Nunes has been doing outstanding work to get to the

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,040
truth for the American people.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,080
Today, I had the opportunity to go into a confidential setting to make sure that what

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,480
we can do is understand better what actually took place.

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:47,040
And I'm here to tell all of America tonight that I am shocked to read exactly what has

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,080
taken place.

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,280
I would think that it would never happen in a country that loves freedom and democracy

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,140
like this country.

40
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,640
It is time that we become transparent in all of this and I am calling on our leadership

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,040
to make this available so that all Americans can judge for themselves.

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,340
Well holy shit, this sounds like it could be big.

43
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,060
Even though we don't necessarily know the contents of this infamous memo just yet, surely

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,560
the news is reporting on it, right?

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Right?

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
CNN?

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
MSNBC?

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
You guys want to talk about it?

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
No?

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,160
You think the anti-Trump resistance is a year old as a more important story?

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Well okay.

52
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,480
Jesus Christ, I never thought I'd have to go to Fox News for actual fucking reporting.

53
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,200
What I read today in that classified briefing room is as bad as I thought it was, and every

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,820
single American citizen should have the ability to see that information to know exactly what

55
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,120
our FBI was up to.

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,520
I compared it to, I remember the day I walked in two years ago, on the Benghazi committee,

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,040
walked in and saw the immunity agreements that were given to people in the Clinton investigation.

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,440
I didn't know who they'd given them to.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,020
I opened up that folder and I looked down and the Justice Department officials slid

60
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,560
that folder over to me on that table and looked down and see they gave Cheryl Mills immunity

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,340
during the Clinton investigation, Clinton's chief of staff, her lawyer.

62
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,100
Today when I read the material, I had that same shock feeling.

63
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,740
I was like, wait a minute, this actually happened from our Justice Department and this FBI?

64
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,900
That's how serious this is.

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,320
That's why we're calling on every bit of that information we got to see today to be made

66
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,320
public for you to see, for journalists to see, most importantly for the American people

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
to see.

68
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,360
After Jim and Mark Meadows and many others of us reviewed the intelligence information

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,000
today, it is abundantly clear that the entire Mueller investigation is a lie built on a

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,240
foundation of corruption.

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,720
And what is so important is that we get this information into the public square.

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,680
The best disinfectant for this corruption is going to be sunshine.

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
And that's why Jim Jordan and I have joined many other members of Congress in calling

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,480
for this information to be released for the review of all of the American people.

75
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,480
And the key reason that all Americans need to see this memo is that it names names.

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,960
It says who was involved with who, how different actors and characters we've heard about interacted

77
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
with one another.

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,520
And that is the type of information that we need all Americans to see immediately.

79
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,040
So it sounds like some serious underhanded shit went down during the 2016 presidential

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
election.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,440
And really, most of us have already suspected this to be the case for a while now.

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,160
But if this is actually true and there's actually evidence for it now, it's no wonder

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,840
that the Release the Memo hashtag started trending so quickly.

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,240
Oh, how nice of you to purge the trending list by the next morning, Twitter.

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,840
Can't let any wrong thing disseminate to the citizens, eh?

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,040
Oh, you're also going to ban the official Twitter account of the United States House

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,960
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the section of government that revealed the

88
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,160
classified memo to Congress?

89
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,520
Yeah, that's a good idea.

90
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,000
Plug up that dam with your thumb, Twitter, and it'll all work out.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,040
Hillary's still got a pass at the White House.

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay, okay, enough goofing around.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,460
Let's get to the heart of the issue.

94
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,880
You all know I'm not a huge fan of Ben Shapiro generally, but so far, his article titled

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,800
Release the Memo Trends as Republicans call for releasing a shocking classified memo showing

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,280
FISSA abuses in Russian collusion investigation seems to be the only mainstream take on the

97
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
topic so far.

98
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,960
Shapiro writes, So, what could be in the memo?

99
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,300
An educated guess would suggest that the memo shows that the FBI initiated its investigation

100
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,980
based on the so-called Steele dossier, a compendium of opposition research compiled

101
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,700
by Fusion GPS on the instructions of the Democratic National Committee.

102
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,840
If it is indeed the case that FISSA warrants were requested on the basis of DNC funded

103
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,940
opposition research, that would appear to politicize the FBI in serious ways.

104
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,620
Let's define some of the players here.

105
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,920
We all know who the FBI is, the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,340
Under James Comey, the Bureau handled both the investigation into Hillary Clinton's

107
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,060
email server during the 2016 election, and later the possibility of Russian interference

108
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,120
in the election in 2017.

109
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,020
President Donald Trump sacked Comey on May 9, 2017.

110
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,520
There's some confusion surrounding Comey's dismissal, with Trump supporters believing

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,540
that Comey was let go due to the reasons that Trump gave publicly, that Comey just wasn't

112
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,500
doing a good job and that Trump was acting on the recommendations of his senior staff,

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,720
while others believe that Trump was trying to cover up collusion between his campaign

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
and the Russian government.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,740
But nonetheless, the investigation continued on, with The Independent publishing an article

116
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,400
stating that Robert Mueller, who is now in charge of the investigation, apparently has

117
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,960
enough evidence to bring criminal charges against Trump's former National Security

118
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,060
Advisor, Michael Flynn, due to these Russian connections.

119
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,900
Mr. Flynn resigned in February after just 24 days in the role when it emerged he had

120
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,540
lied to administration officials, including Mike Pence, the Vice President, about his

121
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,820
communications with representatives of the Russian government.

122
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,180
FISSA warrants refers to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

123
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,420
This is pretty straightforward.

124
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,620
If the FBI requested a warrant for foreign surveillance on the basis of evidence provided

125
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,500
by DNC-funded partisan research, Shapiro is right when he states that the FBI has become

126
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,640
biased toward one political party.

127
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,280
Trump has spoken about the FISSA Act recently as well, predictably through Twitter.

128
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,660
House votes on controversial FISSA Act today.

129
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,840
This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony dossier,

130
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,680
to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump campaign by the previous administration and others.

131
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,840
Disproven and paid for by Democrats.

132
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,280
Dossier used a spy on Trump campaign.

133
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,080
Did FBI use Intel Tool to influence the election?

134
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,700
Did Dems or Clinton also pay the Russians?

135
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,140
Where are the hidden and smashed DNC servers?

136
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,700
Where are crooked Hillary emails?

137
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
What a mess.

138
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,620
The long-standing position of Trump's administration is that the Obama administration wiretapped

139
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,660
Trump Tower in an effort to unearth evidence of Russian collusion, and may have broken

140
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,920
the law in doing so.

141
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,820
The memo is referred to in the Release the Memo hashtag, sounds like they may actually

142
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,100
contain evidence proving this to be the case.

143
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,900
Well, what is this DNC-funded opposition research that the FBI apparently used as its basis

144
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,140
for a FISSA warrant?

145
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,520
That would be the Steele dossier, and we all know this document quite well.

146
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,400
It's that ridiculous Donald Trump fanfiction from 2016 alleging that Trump went on a hooker-fuelled

147
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,040
binge in Moscow that was pretty clearly fake from the get-go, and that only Buzzfeed decided

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,440
to publish because Buzzfeed is a piss rag.

149
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,940
Mark Alias, an attorney of record for the Democratic National Committee and a part of

150
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:57,120
Hillary Clinton's campaign, hired the company Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.

151
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,800
Fusion GPS, in turn, hired the British intelligence firm Orbis Business Intelligence.

152
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,500
Orbis' co-founder Christopher Steele, a retired MI6 officer, compiled the Steele dossier,

153
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,520
and eventually passed it on to not only his clients, but the American and British governments.

154
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,380
On the one hand, Steele has a long history of quality and integrity in his work, and

155
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,980
the dossier does include some troubling allegations.

156
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,620
On the other hand, the dossier also alleges that Trump requested a room in a hotel that

157
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,900
Obama specifically stayed in and hired hookers to piss on the bed.

158
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,780
There's obvious problems right from the get-go if the FBI took the Trump piss orgy

159
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,100
story seriously.

160
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,080
But more importantly, the Steele dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
and Hillary's campaign.

162
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,560
The FBI's obligation to be an apolitical organization has been violated if the FBI

163
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,560
used the Steele dossier to obtain the FISA warrants necessary to act against Trump's

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,600
campaign, considering that the Steele dossier was entirely funded by Hillary's campaign.

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,440
Like Trump said in his tweets, an extension of the controversial FISA act was voted on

166
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,800
recently, and now those papers sit on Trump's desk, waiting for either a verification or

167
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
a veto.

168
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,040
If hashtag release the memo's fear is to be believed, then the FISA act has clearly

169
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,540
been abused.

170
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
Against Trump.

171
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,500
In my opinion, if we see a Trump veto, that's likely another sign that whatever is contained

172
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,860
within the memo is both legitimate and serious.

173
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,220
Oh hey, while I was writing this script, both the Washington Times and the Business Insider

174
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,900
decided to publish stories on hashtag release the memo.

175
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,980
Finally, some mainstream media coverage.

176
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,300
I wonder if it's going to actually address the issues or just blame everything on the

177
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Russians.

178
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,620
Interest in the classified House Intelligence Committee memo, which reportedly outlines

179
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,400
how the anti-Trump dossier was used by the FBI to justify surveillance against Donald

180
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,440
Trump's presidential campaign, has caused an online frenzy.

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,240
Last Thursday, WikiLeaks jumped into the proceedings, offering a reward of up to $1 million to anyone

182
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,520
who could send them a copy.

183
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,900
Meanwhile, reports emerged that the Twitter hashtag calling for the memo's public release,

184
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,120
hashtag release the memo, was receiving a major online push by Russian-linked Twitter

185
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
accounts.

186
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,840
Yeah, I think we all saw that one coming.

187
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,880
Guys, I guess we're all just Russian Twitter accounts.

188
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,600
I'll just have to go get my Canadian birth certificate and passport switched over.

189
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,660
On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines to release the FISA

190
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
abuse memo.

191
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,620
According to sources close to the committee, it addresses text messages between FBI agent

192
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,420
Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, which proved the dossier was used to justify FISA

193
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,420
warrants.

194
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,020
Well, the Republicans wanted Congress to see the memo and the Democrats didn't.

195
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,940
That's no surprise, considering that the memo would indict the Clinton campaign, the

196
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,660
FBI, and Obama's White House.

197
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,680
A Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, described the memo as a profoundly misleading

198
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,120
set of talking points drafted by Republican staff attacking the FBI, and that it was rife

199
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,420
with factual inaccuracies and referencing highly classified materials that most of Republican

200
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,780
Intelligence Committee members were forced to acknowledge they had never read.

201
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,940
Okay, so the Democratic position is that the memo is just false.

202
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
That's fine.

203
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,660
But if that's the case, then why did the rest of the Democrats in Congress refuse to

204
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,660
even view the memo with their Republican counterparts?

205
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,440
What's interesting is that this morning the Democrats decided to vote against releasing

206
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
this memo.

207
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
That's number one.

208
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,880
Number two, when I was in the room, and I've heard from other members of Congress, when

209
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,660
they were in the room, there were no Democrats who actually came down to look at this memo.

210
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,300
So they were so interested in the Russia collusion story until their Russia collusion story actually

211
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,500
started unraveling.

212
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,080
So now that we have some information that is being provided to every member of the House,

213
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,340
they are unwilling to release it or to even look at it.

214
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,480
I mean, if it's fake, there's no harm, right?

215
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,320
Come on, I thought you guys cared about Russia, don't you want to see the evidence?

216
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,820
Why hasn't some Democratic small fry in Congress leaked it to CNN yet, like every other scrap

217
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,640
of Russian news in the past year?

218
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,960
Maybe it's because the memo actually vindicates Trump.

219
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,900
Maybe it paints Obama or Hillary in an exceptionally bad light.

220
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Those who have seen the memo have said that people may go to jail over this.

221
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,620
And if you think it's a bit conspiratorial to link Obama to all of this, let me remind

222
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,900
you of this 2014 interview of Democratic Congressman Maxine Waters.

223
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,860
An organization that contains the kind of database that no one has ever seen before

224
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,100
in life.

225
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
That's going to be very, very powerful.

226
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
And whoever-

227
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,260
In terms of the organizing for America, that he's now shifting to become a 501c4.

228
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
That's right.

229
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
That's right.

230
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,180
And that database will have information about everything on every individual in ways that

231
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,720
it's never been done before.

232
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,100
And whoever runs for president on the Democratic ticket have to deal with that.

233
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,500
They're going to have to go down with that database and the concerns of those people

234
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,300
because they can't get around it.

235
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
And he's been very smart.

236
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,380
I mean, it's very powerful what he's leaving in place.

237
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,900
And I think that's what any Democratic candidate is going to have to deal with.

238
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,340
We have two positions here, two big questions.

239
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,900
The Democrats are asking, was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian

240
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
government?

241
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,000
And is there currently collusion between the Trump administration and the Russian government?

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,460
The Republicans are asking, did Obama's FBI dress up Clinton campaign funded research

243
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,660
from Fusing GPS to look like an intelligence document in order to justify spying on the

244
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,620
Trump campaign using the FISA act?

245
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,580
These two questions have been kicked back and forth for a while now.

246
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,180
But the answer to both of them is in the memo.

247
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,840
And it's telling that the Republicans want it released while the Democrats do not.

248
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,900
That Washington Post article from earlier stated that the memo could be released next

249
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,180
week provided that the White House does not object.

250
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,300
And let's hope that Trump doesn't object.

251
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,500
This is David Nunez.

252
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,200
He's been working on the memo for the past four months.

253
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,660
Maybe its contents are fake.

254
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
Maybe they're not.

255
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,840
We'll only know when we can see the memo for ourselves.

256
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,580
Maybe the memo is just a big fat distraction from the upcoming government shutdown.

257
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,940
And Republicans, please stop whining about it.

258
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,260
Your party also took on the role of an obstructionist when you attempted to shut down Obama's government

259
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
as well.

260
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,660
Or maybe the memo is real and the Democrats are throwing up as many roadblocks and distractions

261
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,260
as they can in order to protect their star players.

262
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,820
Hell, maybe the shutdown is a stratagem designed to prevent a congressional vote on the memo's

263
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
release.

264
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,340
I'll leave you with a Hillary Clinton quote directed to Donna Brazile.

265
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,260
If that fucking bastard wins, we all hang from nooses.

266
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Lauer's finished.

267
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,380
And if I lose, it's on all your heads for screwing up.

268
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,060
You'd better fix this shit.

269
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:30,620
The American people deserve, they must, they want to know what's in this document.

270
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,820
Release the memo.

271
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:39,500
Release the memo and all of the related materials sourced in the memo.

272
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,060
Release the file.

273
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,840
There's no concern there should not be for compromising any good sources and methods

274
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,560
by releasing the memo and releasing the file.

275
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,220
What it would reveal is the Fed's reliance on bad sources and methods.
