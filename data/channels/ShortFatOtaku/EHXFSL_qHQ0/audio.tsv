0	6000	Is JK Rowling transphobic? Is she a TERF? That is the question today.
6000	12000	Now, for one, I've been called a TERF. Doesn't make any sense because I'm not a feminist.
12000	19000	And the F in TERF stands for feminist. It's a trans exclusionary radical feminist.
19000	22000	So you can't be a TERF if you're not a feminist.
22000	29000	This also ties into the idea that apparently people on the left think TERFs are right-wing now?
29000	31000	I don't know about that.
31000	35000	The TERF ideology grew out of people like Valerie Solanas and Andrea Dworkin,
35000	38000	though she would go back and forth on that topic over the course of her career.
38000	42000	A book that I had to read when learning about all this stuff in university was
42000	46000	The House That Jill Built, a Lesbian Nation in Formation.
46000	52000	And that book basically described the ideological split that began within the second wave of feminism,
52000	58000	where some women believed that trans women were in fact women and deserved a place at the feminist table,
58000	64000	while other women believed that trans women were simply male infiltrators into female-only spaces.
64000	71000	With the Lesbian Organization of Toronto in 1978 putting out a statement saying,
71000	77000	A woman's voice was almost never heard as a woman's voice. It was always filtered through men's voices.
77000	82000	So here a guy comes along saying, I'm going to be a girl now and speak for girls.
82000	87000	And we thought, no you're not. A person cannot just join the oppressed.
87000	90000	And it's not like their ideas aren't internally consistent.
90000	97000	When your entire philosophy, when the source of your activism, comes from the idea that women are biologically distinct from men,
97000	102000	and that they therefore have different concerns, different needs, they face different oppressions,
102000	107000	I can definitely see why, through that lens, you would exclude male infiltrators.
107000	109000	But that's obviously not the whole story, is it?
109000	113000	Because if you believe that trans women are women, then they do have a place.
113000	115000	They're a different type of woman, obviously.
115000	122000	I don't think anybody who has their head on straight can say that cis women and trans women are the same type of woman.
122000	124000	There's very clearly something different there.
124000	131000	But I think any reasonable person can see that they are part of a broader feminine coalition.
131000	133000	So, J.K. Rowling, then.
133000	136000	I mean, she's older, isn't she?
136000	138000	Do you think she can be grandmothered in?
138000	142000	You know how you always have that one older relative who, you know, just doesn't quite get it?
142000	147000	But you just let him be because, you know, within five to ten years, they're gonna be either dead or irrelevant, so it's like, whatever.
147000	149000	How old is J.K. Rowling?
149000	151000	Oh, she's 55.
151000	154000	That's not that old, is it?
154000	155000	Damn.
155000	157000	I thought she was older than that.
157000	161000	This is not a story that I've commented on on my channel, even though it's been developing over the years,
161000	165000	because frankly, I don't know too much about it, so let's kind of explore it together, okay?
166000	172000	From what I can tell, the J.K. Rowling transphobia thing started a few years ago with this tweet.
190000	193000	Now, on the face of it, to me, this seems like a completely reasonable tweet, doesn't it?
194000	196000	Of course, that's personal freedom.
212000	217000	Now, this is interesting because it is often the case that gender and sex are conflated in this conversation.
217000	224000	Most people who go by the trans women are women thing, they will say, and I think correctly so,
224000	229000	that gender is the social role, while sex is the biological component of the conversation.
229000	235000	So for me, it seems completely reasonable for me to say trans women are women and trans women are male.
235000	239000	Trans women are not female because they're not biological females.
239000	243000	However, they are women because that is the social component of the equation.
243000	248000	So I think trans women are women, trans women are male, those are both true statements.
248000	252000	And I am personally happy to use, like, Lilith's pronouns when I'm talking to her or something like that,
252000	258000	not because I actually believe she's a biological female, she's not, and she's even said that she isn't,
258000	263000	but because I'm being polite, because I respect her as a person, because she's my friend.
263000	268000	And just as I wouldn't shit-talk a friend behind their backs, I wouldn't do that to Lilith either.
268000	275000	But on the face of it, this seems okay. I guess Mark Hamill liked it? Was that a thing? Alright.
275000	280000	Apparently what J.K. Rowling was referring to was this individual, Maya Forstater.
280000	284000	She lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex,
284000	289000	and she brought that to a tribunal, and then she lost that tribunal last December.
289000	295000	However, check this out, a woman who lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex
295000	298000	has lost an employment tribunal. Wasn't that the case?
298000	304000	Like, that was just literally the linguistic sleight of hand that I was talking about a few minutes ago.
304000	308000	People can't change their biological sex. They can change their gender.
308000	314000	They can have various cosmetic surgeries if they want, but they can't change their biological sex.
314000	319000	At least, with our current level of technology, I'm sure at some point we're going to have the cyberpunk future,
319000	324000	where you can kind of zap yourself or take a pill and you'll be completely changed, even down to the chromosomes.
324000	328000	That'll probably actually happen. You know, human ingenuity knows no bounds, in my opinion.
328000	333000	But, like, the way things currently are, no, you can't change your biological sex.
333000	335000	I don't think that's controversial to say.
335000	342000	Maya Forstater did not have her contract renewed after posting a series of tweets questioning government plans to let people declare their own gender.
342000	347000	Well, this is different from biological sex. Look at this, look at this. It's completely different.
347000	354000	I really think that, like, people who report on this, they conflate the terms to make things seem more sensationalist than they actually are.
354000	361000	Ms. Forstater believes that trans women holding certificates that recognize their transgender identity cannot describe themselves as women.
361000	365000	But that view is not worthy of respect in a democratic society, a judge said.
365000	367000	I don't know. It depends on the kind of certificate, doesn't it?
367000	373000	Like, in my opinion, if it were, say, a driver's license, it should probably say female on it if you're a trans woman,
373000	380000	because if the officer who's pulling you over for a traffic stop or something has to look at you and then look at your license,
380000	384000	they don't need to know anything about what's in your pants. It doesn't matter to them.
384000	388000	So I have no problem with it saying female, because in that situation you're presenting as female.
388000	395000	However, if it were going to be the biological sex on, say, a health card, like an Ontario health card or something like that,
395000	400000	or like a health card for some other kind of service, then you might want to put on that card, you know, the biological sex,
400000	404000	maybe the fact that you're trans, stuff like that, because trans people have unique medical needs.
404000	410000	You can't simply medically treat trans women as if they are the same as cis women because they have different medical needs.
410000	414000	So, in my opinion, it depends what certificate we're talking about, right?
414000	418000	Okay, so she was working as a tax expert at the Think Tank Center for Global Development.
418000	424000	She was not entitled to ignore the rights of a transgender person and the enormous pain that can be caused by misgendering.
424000	429000	Yeah, okay, okay. Like, I understand misgendering is rude.
429000	434000	I understand that if I were to misgender somebody, they likely wouldn't want to associate with me.
434000	436000	I don't necessarily buy the enormous pain.
436000	444000	In fact, I think what's going on here is that the more a person doesn't pass, the more that misgendering might hurt them, right?
444000	449000	Like, I know that people who are exceptionally cruel, they might call Lilith a man.
449000	454000	However, Lilith is quite attractive. She passes quite well.
454000	457000	And I think she just laughs it off because she knows that she passes quite well.
457000	461000	But what was the actual event? Like, did she refuse to use a pronoun?
461000	463000	Like, I want to find it here. Hold on.
463000	467000	It doesn't really say, does it? Maybe it's in the judgment. Let's see.
467000	476000	The claimant stated that she first became concerned about proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act because of proposals for a move to permitting people to self-identify their gender.
476000	483000	The claimant started to research the subject in 2017-2018 and began to tweet about it in August of 2018.
483000	485000	She tweeted,
498000	502000	I don't know about this. If this is the case, I can't select it.
502000	511000	If this is the case here, I definitely think that a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria is probably a better barometer than simply self-identification.
511000	521000	Couldn't I then, just for shits and giggles, walk into, say, some kind of place that issues a license or any kind of official paperwork in the UK?
521000	522000	I don't know what they're called over there.
522000	528000	But couldn't I walk in and be like, I self-identify as a woman. I want an F on this driver's license.
528000	530000	And they would have no choice but to give it to me?
531000	536000	That seems a bit ridiculous to me. It doesn't necessarily seem damaging, but it seems dumb.
536000	548000	I share the concerns of fairplay women that radically expanding the legal definition of women so that it can include both males and females makes it a meaningless concept and will undermine women's rights and protections for vulnerable women and girls.
548000	552000	Yeah, I'm not sure about that. I mean, maybe, but I'm not convinced.
552000	568000	Some transgender people have cosmetic surgery. Most retain their birth genitals. Everyone's equality and safety should be protected, but women and girls lose out on privacy, safety, and fairness if males are allowed into changing rooms, dormitories, prisons, and sports teams.
568000	574000	Well, those are all very different situations. For example, regarding changing rooms, I've always hated changing rooms.
575000	585000	I don't want to see another guy's dick in the changing room. It actually makes me kind of uncomfortable. I'd rather, for a gym, I'd rather that they have stalls and there's none and it kind of sucks.
585000	593000	I don't want to go into a girl's changing room. I don't want to go into a guy's changing room. The entire concept just seems not private enough for me.
593000	603000	And I kind of feel the same way about washrooms as well. I'd rather public washrooms, rather than having stalls and urinals, just be replaced with individual-use washrooms.
603000	616000	I don't know where this quasi-communal peeing came into about, but I've never liked it. Anyway, dormitories. I guess in the UK, there's still sex-segregated dormitories, huh? They're not that common over here.
616000	626000	It's probably okay to let trans women into a woman's dormitory, I think, and mainly it's because if there's going to be sexual assault in a woman's dormitory, it doesn't matter really who's committing it.
626000	635000	If a cis woman were to sexually violate another cis woman, the fact that they're in the same dorm, it doesn't really matter.
635000	643000	Now with prisons, I'm actually on the opposite side of the whole dormitories thing. Because with prisons, you have people who are already guilty of something in there, right?
643000	658000	I actually recall seeing there was a case, I think, in the UK where a guy, who was in fact a guy, as soon as he knew he was going to prison, he immediately transitioned so that he could get into a woman's prison and continue raping women in prison because he was going to prison for rape.
658000	666000	And the legal system over in the UK just didn't want to say a single thing about it because they didn't want to come off as transphobic. And to me, that is ridiculous.
666000	676000	It is a single situation, and I'm sure it does not happen often, but it still seems ridiculous to me. Like, they probably should have caught that one at least.
676000	685000	But prisons are a harder one because these are people who are already criminals, and they may in fact be more likely to get up to some shady shit than somebody who's in a dormitory, you know?
685000	692000	Sports teams. The sports team is one I'm completely against, and it's mainly because of the physical differences between trans women and cis women.
692000	703000	And I think that's something that is very well documented. However, I don't have a solution to that problem. Like, if you think about it, there's not really enough trans people to have a trans league, is there?
703000	707000	At the end of December 2018, the claimant said, uh,
707000	717000	I think feminists are non-gender conforming and trans people are natural allies. If you look at the people that are concerned about this, they are lesbians, long-term LGBT activists, transsexuals, left-wing campaigners. They don't want to enforce gender conformity.
717000	730000	Of course, in social situations, I would treat any trans woman as an honorary female and use whatever pronouns, etc. I wouldn't try to hurt anyone's feelings, but I don't think people should be compelled to play along with literal delusions like trans women are women.
730000	740000	You know, it's hard to argue with this logic, isn't it? Because while I do think trans women are women, this is an internally consistent logic that she wrote right here.
740000	751000	She's saying that she would treat any trans woman as an honorary female. I wouldn't word it as honorary female, but I get what she's saying. She'd use whatever pronouns that she wanted. She wouldn't try to hurt anyone's feelings.
751000	763000	You know, that's all stuff that you do in a polite society. And I actually agree here. I don't think people should be compelled to say things like trans women are women. If they want to say them, fine. But I don't think an authority should force them.
763000	771000	I don't think this is something that the state should impose on people. I'm happy to do it because I agree with it, but I wouldn't want my views forced on anybody else.
771000	783000	Please stand up for the truth that it is not possible for someone who is male to become female. Trans women are men and should be respected and protected as men. This is that conflation that I was talking about again.
783000	795000	It is not possible for someone who is male to become female. True. Trans women are men because men is the social role. I have to say no. False.
796000	816000	I get the Sargon argument, you know, the adult human female argument. I get it. It makes complete sense. However, for me, it's like adult human female with an asterisk beside it. And the asterisk is simply the general fact that exceptions to the rule exist and often prove the rule true.
816000	828000	I consider trans women to be that exception. I consider trans men to be that exception. Even though trans women fulfill the role of adult, yes. Human, yes. Female, no.
828000	838000	I still consider them women because they are the exception that proves the rule. Because they are adapting a social role that does not actually line up with their biology.
838000	850000	And yet they're still making a good faith effort at it. So if your goal is to be polite to somebody or build a relationship with them or something along those lines, why wouldn't you treat them with that kind of respect?
850000	856000	I think it's something that you do if you're nice, but I don't think the government should force you to do it. It's as simple as that.
856000	861000	So this continues on. There's actually a lot of other comments. There's so many. We can't go through all of them, can we?
861000	875000	But a lot of this stuff is literally conflating male and man, female and woman. Gender and sex. Okay, I get it. They are somewhat linked. No one's going to deny that. There's a reason why every single culture creates similar gender roles even though they're not exactly the same.
875000	884000	There's probably something biological there. But at the same time, that is no reason that if you're an outlier, you can't inhabit the other role.
884000	894000	Wait, what did she do?
894000	899000	It doesn't really say. Was she literally just fired over tweets? Hold on.
899000	901000	Okay, here we go. I think I finally found it on The Guardian.
901000	905000	Maya Forstater's case was about protected beliefs, not trans rights.
905000	913000	She will use somebody's preferred pronouns out of politeness but doesn't feel bound to because she fundamentally doesn't accept that a man can properly become a woman.
913000	923000	I mean, if you were to change this use of man to male and this use of woman to female, this is kind of how I feel.
923000	933000	I use somebody's preferred pronouns out of politeness, but I don't feel bound to because I fundamentally don't accept that a male can properly become a female.
933000	940000	Yes, that is pretty much my position. Because one, I don't feel bound to do anything.
940000	946000	No authority will tell me what to say. I will say whatever the fuck I want.
946000	955000	Anyone or anything that would enforce compelled speech on anybody is inherently tyrannical. Doesn't matter what the speech is.
955000	964000	Secondly, and more importantly, I don't think the government should be able to enforce politeness, and I think it would be disastrous for you to actually attempt so.
964000	975000	I use Lilith's pronouns because I'm polite. I consider her to be a woman because I'm polite, in the exact same way that I consider my cis girlfriend to be a woman.
975000	992000	Because I'm polite. There are many instances where people who are specifically being rude, maybe because they're an asshole or because they have a grievance, you know, who knows, but they will approach somebody who is obviously a cis woman but looks very masculine and will treat them like a man because they're being a dick.
992000	997000	That is not being polite, but it shouldn't be illegal.
997000	1005000	And in the same way, I consider Lilith a woman because I'm being polite, and politeness is all you need. The state doesn't need to step in.
1005000	1010000	Jesus Christ, this video is turning into my trans rant, so maybe I should just get on with it.
1010000	1022000	Okay, she lost an employment tribunal case which, had she won it, would have allowed her to take legal action against a global development think tank that did not renew her contract after she started posting views some staff found offensive on Twitter.
1022000	1030000	Well, it's not really getting fired, is it? Like, not renewing a contract is not the same thing as losing your job.
1030000	1037000	Like, if they just said, oh, we're going to fire you now, I think that'd be outrageous. It would be over the line. But they just said, we're just not going to hire you back.
1037000	1045000	Like, that's reasonable. People can not renew contracts for any fucking reason they want. Once the contract's over, the relationship is done.
1045000	1061000	Okay, that was a fucking rabbit hole. But JK Rowling came out in defense of this person. It seems like she did so out of ignorance because the way that she framed her tweet was that she thought the person was getting fired, but they weren't, they were just not having their contract renewed.
1061000	1067000	Does that tweet make JK Rowling transphobic? It probably just makes her ignorant. I don't think it makes her transphobic.
1067000	1077000	As far as I can tell, that was only one data point in a series of data points. And somebody compiled all the instances of JK Rowling's transphobia, so let's at least give him a skim, eh?
1077000	1082000	Let's go down here. Am I a forester legal case? All right, so we've seen that. Let's see the rest of them.
1082000	1093000	Support for Magdalene Burns. Magdalene was a great believer in the importance of biological sex and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises.
1093000	1107000	None of this is arguable. If you're a lesbian and you don't want to date a trans woman with a penis, it's not bigotry, it's just preference. Holy Christ.
1107000	1111000	Every single trans person I know and interact with agrees with me on this.
1111000	1123000	Yeah, see, I've, uh, maybe things have changed over the years, but I have met a number of trans individuals on Twitter who are completely insane and they're like, no, you're a bigot.
1123000	1133000	It's like, no, dude, no. The reason JK Rowling received such a backlash for supporting Magdalene Burns wasn't because she believed in sex or because she observed how sexuality works.
1133000	1140000	It was because of Burns' very openly transphobic, antagonistic, and often conspiratorial views on trans people. Okay, let's see these views.
1140000	1148000	You are fucking blackface actors. You aren't women. You're men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women.
1148000	1161000	Oh, I think you're like confusing trans women with like a sissy Hypno or something. Magdalene, I don't know if you know what's going on. Holy fuck.
1161000	1174000	Like the second one, George Soros, the money behind the trans, this is nothing, all right? George Soros is literally the prince of fucking darkness, so whatever. I'm sure he has, he has his fingers in many a pie, but this, wow.
1174000	1183000	Our oppression isn't a fetish, you pathetic, sick fuck. Jesus Christ. Yeah, no, I would, I would actually classify this as some transphobia here, dude.
1184000	1197000	Terf, everything in this passage, like J.K. Rowling's quotes, they seem to be stupid. Biology, as someone who is an avid lover of biology, I find the gender critical ignorance of biology and their blind faith in it that agrees with everything they already think very frustrating.
1197000	1208000	All right, all right, okay. Clownfish, one of the many animals that changes sex in the wild. Okay, yeah, yeah, fine, you know, but we are not clownfish, we're humans. It's a little bit different.
1208000	1224000	In terms of biology, J.K. Rowling actually seems to be rather correct, because generally when it comes to biology, the biological argument almost always falls into the, you know, the non-trans side of things, just because, you know, if you're a reasonable trans person, you accept your own biology.
1224000	1227000	That is the point of transitioning, frankly.
1227000	1238000	Education and safeguarding. The second reason is that I'm an ex-teacher and the founder of a children's charity which gives me an interest in both education and safeguarding. Like many others, I have deep concerns about the effect the trans rights movement is having on both.
1238000	1249000	Okay, so what does that effect? This person grew up in the era of Section 28, a horrible and oppressive law that made it illegal for schools to even acknowledge that LGBT people existed.
1249000	1266000	Okay, I agree actually, yeah. Teaching kids, but well, maybe not kids, you know. Over here, sex ed when I was younger started at I think grade 5 or grade 6, which would have been 10 or 11, maybe 12? I think that's a reasonable age to start at.
1266000	1279000	You know, it probably shouldn't be a kindergarten thing. There is no problem with teaching kids of that proper age that LGBT people exist. It is part of the human sexual experience.
1279000	1284000	You shouldn't be teaching it to kindergarteners, but you should be teaching it to people who are like 10 or 11 or 12. Fine.
1284000	1292000	Freedom of speech. Trans people are finally for the first time in centuries being allowed to speak freely about what and who they are.
1292000	1302000	Freedom of speech is what has allowed us to gain rights at all. I 100% agree, which is probably why we shouldn't be curtailing freedom of speech for those individuals who disagree with you.
1302000	1314000	And I'm saying that as somebody who agrees with you, generally. If some asshole wants to misgender you and treat you like shit because you're trans, well that's their right, and you have the right to tell them to fuck off and not associate with them.
1314000	1330000	I don't think the state should be coming down on anybody one way or the other. And no, saying that transphobes have free speech too and they should be able to exercise it as long as they're not actually attacking somebody else or inciting violence, that's not debating your existence.
1330000	1336000	I really hate the existence argument that comes out of the trans lobby because that generally is not what's going on.
1336000	1348000	If I'm a dick and I refuse to use your pronouns, that's not me debating your existence. You very clearly are still there. You're not going to Thanos snap away if I use the wrong pronoun. That's just me being a dick.
1348000	1360000	Holy fuck, is JK Rowling threatening somebody over a tweet? Fucking hell, dude. I'm gonna sue you because you shitposted on the internet.
1360000	1376000	Lisa Littman and rapid onset gender dysphoria. Nobody, the activist, insisted could ever be persuaded into being trans. The claims that LGBT people are confused or that they've been tricked into being LGBT or that they can be converted out of it are as old as homophobia and transphobia themselves.
1376000	1392000	I agree with the caveat because there are definitely people who go through phases for sure. You can't say that there's not. Scrump is one of them. He went from being completely straight to only wanting to fuck femme boys over the course of five years.
1392000	1403000	Sexuality does change. It is a taste. And like any other taste in music, in food, in whatever, it will change over time. It'll change naturally. And I think you can actually push it a little bit.
1403000	1420000	If you are bi questioning and you watch way more gay porn, you might end up swinging more and more in that direction. I think you can actually do that to yourself. However, I don't think that the Mike Pence shock somebody, strap them to a chair and make them straight is gonna work.
1420000	1432000	I think you have to like be open minded and willing to do that to yourself. And I think it does at least work on some level. I don't think you can be forced to do it, but I think you do have that control over yourself over a long period of time.
1432000	1448000	And like when it comes to rapid onset gender dysphoria, you can't deny that there's like a pink pilling culture out there. A friend of mine, Ava, is male. However, he takes hormones to look more like a girl, but does not want to transition.
1448000	1461000	He's completely a gay male. He just wants to look like he basically wants to be a trap. Okay, that's the situation. There's there's no like, there's no desire to transition or to be to identify as a woman or live as a woman or anything like that.
1461000	1477000	They simply want to be a really, really girly looking gay male, and Ava looks more like a woman than a lot of people that I know. But he's still male. And that's the point. And he experienced this from what he's told me that there are definitely people who who went to him and said, Hey, you need to transition.
1477000	1490000	You need to transition. And he's like, No, I don't. I'll just take estrogen, but be a man. And they're like, No, you're offensive to us. So like, you can't deny that there's like not like a pink pillar or I think people call it like egg culture.
1490000	1500000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Egg. Egg is a name for a trans person who is in total denial of being trans. They are most of the time questioning their gender identity actually, or just trying to figure what the heck is going on in their life.
1500000	1512000	Or Joe says, Wow, I really want a skirt that goes spinny. And then Bob says, What? Joe says, Oh, I'm still sis. Bob says, Are you an egg? Joe says, What? No, of course not. And the ends with Joe is definitely an egg.
1512000	1528000	Now, the whole point of the egg idea is that if you if you question your gender at all, and I think everyone has like everyone thinks, Hey, I wonder what it would be like to be like wake up for a day and like be the opposite sex, you know, hmm, that doesn't make you trans, it just means that you have an inquisitive mind.
1529000	1547000	But the trans egg people, which there is like a weird subculture that I've begun to delve into, maybe I'll do a video on it because it's kind of fucked. But they basically take anybody who questions gender at all, anybody who might cross dress, and even though they're sure they're not trans, and they say no, you're an egg.
1548000	1563000	And it's our responsibility to hatch you into a trans person. And they kind of like they like push them into it. And it's like, fucking hell, man. This is insane. This is some nutty shit. So I do think that what JK Rowling is talking about here is a real phenomenon.
1563000	1578000	It might not be that common. It might not even necessarily be something we have to do anything about other than simply be more willing to tell people to fuck off if you have to desistance, detransition. And if I were a kid today, I would have been trans.
1578000	1596000	I mean, there's a lot of stories of like, trans people who do transition, they're like, yeah, I was just a gay man. And I kind of got pushed into this by those around me. Yeah, I do think this happens. I don't think it's common. And I don't think it invalidates the experiences of actual trans people. But you can't say it doesn't you can't fucking say it doesn't.
1596000	1610000	I'm also aware through extensive research that studies have consistently shown that between 60 to 90% of gender dysphoric teens will grow their dysphoria. And this person even admits some studies do show that prepubescent children showing signs of gender dysphoria will likely grow out of it.
1610000	1623000	They also show that if gender dysphoria persists into adolescence, then it is almost certainly permanent. This is why when I was doing that, that podcast with Lilith, I was saying, Listen, maybe 16 is like the right age where you can start transitioning.
1623000	1641000	You know, legally before that it me it's a little bit muddy, you know, probably not because you don't know. But 16 it's like, okay, if you're still trans by 16. It's like, okay, here we go. Let's do it. And this person even says like, Yeah, you know, someone who's eight or nine saying that I'm a girl, when they're actually a guy, like, you might grow out of it.
1641000	1652000	And you know what, nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with with someone, you know, questioning and then growing out of it and then being sis. And they're just like there's nothing wrong with someone being trans. It's all fine.
1652000	1671000	Misogyny in women as a political class, from the leader of the free world's long history of sexual assault accusations, and his proud boast of grabbing them by the pussy, to the incel movement, to trans activists who declare that terfs need punching and re educating men across the political spectrum seem to agree women are asking for trouble.
1671000	1682000	Yeah, I even if I were to characterize all of this as being the truth, and I think each one of these instances is significantly more complicated than how JK Rowling's portraying here.
1682000	1694000	No, I don't think that the trans activists declaring that terfs need punching is in quite the same boat, because these are nominally right wing violence while this is left wing violence. It does not come from the same source.
1694000	1707000	It does not have the same philosophical underpinning. You can't call them the same thing. It does feel like she's just throwing trans activists under the bus, just because it suits her political purpose in this paragraph so I don't know about this one dude.
1707000	1727000	Trans women think being a woman is a costume, but as many women have said before me, woman is not a costume. Woman is not an idea in a man's head. Woman is not a pink brain, a liking for Jimmy Choo's, or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted as progressive. Holy fuck. This is a bit much for me, dude.
1728000	1730000	Domestic Abuse and Sexual Assault
1730000	1737000	Alright, and I'm sure you know at this point, if you don't, I guess I'll just tell you, that JK Rowling was in fact assaulted by her first husband.
1737000	1745000	If you can come inside my head and understand what I feel when I read about a trans woman dying at the hands of a violent man, you'd find solidarity and kinship.
1745000	1758000	I have a visceral sense of the terror in which these trans women will have spent their last seconds on Earth, because I too have known moments of blind fear, when I realized that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky self-restraint of my attacker.
1759000	1766000	So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe.
1766000	1783000	When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he is a woman, and as I've said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones, then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.
1784000	1793000	There's a practical argument here that I think JK Rowling is probably right about. However, at the same time, there's also a practical argument against it.
1793000	1805000	Lilith is, as we all know, biologically male. Should she decide to walk into a public restroom, and it's a female public restroom, nobody's going to say anything because she looks like a woman.
1805000	1812000	She acts like a woman. She dresses like a woman. She speaks like a woman. She has a woman's voice. Nobody will give a shit.
1812000	1826000	However, if you truly are, like, a male rapist who's using a fake transitioning to try and get ahold of more victims, um, I think it'll be a lot more obvious. At least I would hope.
1826000	1830000	You would not look like Lilith. You would look like it is ma'am. Alright?
1830000	1838000	Fear. Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by trans activists. I know this because so many have gotten in touch with me to tell their stories.
1838000	1847000	They're afraid of doxing, of losing their jobs or their livelihoods, and of violence. That is a legitimate fear. You should not be fired for your political opinions, I don't think.
1847000	1853000	Of course, the counter to this in this article is, in 11 countries it is against the law and punishable by the death penalty to be a trans person.
1853000	1863000	I don't think you can put this on the head of the West. I don't think it's Western countries. Let me just see. I'm kind of curious.
1868000	1873000	Ah, yes, all Middle Eastern and African shitholes, dude.
1873000	1880000	Totally bastions of liberal capitalism and human rights. Yeah, yeah, it's the West's fault that this is the case.
1880000	1889000	In the USA, in 43 states, it is still considered a valid legal defense to murder a trans person if you found yourself attracted to them. Yeah, that's pretty fucked, in my opinion. That's pretty fucked.
1889000	1895000	A lot of this stuff is pretty fucked. But you know what? This is like, oppression olympics, you know? This is straight up whataboutism.
1895000	1905000	The fact that trans people have all of these problems, which are legitimate problems, you cannot deny, does not mean that this isn't a problem. They both are, of course.
1905000	1911000	So, that seems to be the list of data points for J.K. Rowling being a transphobe.
1911000	1919000	And I think it's about half of them that I think I side with. Like, the Maya Forstater legal case. Kinda. Like, half.
1919000	1932000	Support from Magdalene Burns, yes. TERF, yes. Biology, no. Education and safeguarding, yes. Freedom of speech, no. Rapid onset gender dysphoria, no. If I were a kid I would have been trans today, no.
1932000	1944000	Misogyny in women as a political class, yes. Trans people think being women is a costume, yes. Domestic abuse and sexual assault, half and half. Trans women in women's bathrooms, yes. And fear, half and half.
1944000	1953000	So, it seems like of the 13 points here, I think that, like, 6 or 7 is valid, when you really add it all up.
1953000	1961000	Of course, there is the whole Guilt by Association thing, where J.K. Rowling follows people who are a lot more mask off in their transphobia.
1961000	1968000	She's liked tweets that call trans women men in dresses. She claimed it on a middle age moment, alright.
1968000	1972000	She posted this and then deleted it, claiming that she was just copying somebody else's words.
1972000	1983000	I love this truly fabulous Ichabog with its bat ears, mismatched eyes, and terrifying blood-stained teeth. In court, Wolf claimed the Facebook post, which he had said he wanted to fuck up some TERFs, was just bravado.
1983000	1993000	Weird. But fine, I guess you're saying it's somebody else's words and you didn't know. Alright.
1993000	2000000	More recently, you've got people who menstruate. I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben, wimpund, wombed.
2000000	2009000	Yeah, I get the point, but I'd just say female, dude. When women stop menstruating at menopause, they're still considered women, right? So, this doesn't make sense.
2009000	2021000	And of course, most recently of all, you have the new J.K. Rowling book that came out, where apparently there's some kind of murderer, and what he does is he dresses up as women in order to disguise himself while he's committing his crimes.
2021000	2029000	And people are saying that that is transphobic, even though the person who's committing the crimes is a cis man. He's not a trans man, he's not a trans woman, he's not anything like that.
2029000	2038000	It's just that he dresses up as a woman to hide the fact that he's committing these crimes, and he uses it to get into certain spaces and this and that.
2038000	2049000	And because that's not trans, it's not even cross-dressing, in fact. It's literally just a guy wearing a disguise to commit a crime. I don't see how that can be transphobia.
2049000	2056000	However, if you put it into the larger context of some of the things that J.K. Rowling has said, I can see why some people are taking it that way.
2056000	2062000	To me personally, it's just really incredible to think about, because 20 years ago, it was the right wing of politics that was burning J.K. Rowling's books.
2062000	2070000	They were saying that they were possessed by the devil and it was Satan worship and black magic and all this nonsense, but now it's the left doing it.
2070000	2083000	I remember a time when the left were very pro-Harry Potter. You saw at a lot of left-wing protests in the mid-2010s, people holding up signs saying that Trump was Voldemort and all this nonsense.
2083000	2091000	But now you have the left doing the very same things that they decried the right for doing 20 years ago. Damn, getting old is weird.
2091000	2099000	But okay, the final verdict on the question, is J.K. Rowling a transphobe?
2099000	2107000	And as far as I can tell, I mean, maybe?
2107000	2115000	She hasn't gone full mask off. She hasn't said, I hate trans people. She hasn't actively advocated against trans rights specifically.
2115000	2125000	She's advocated for a separation between cis women and trans women in the political sphere, which in practice might actually erode some trans rights, I'm not sure.
2125000	2136000	But even though she hasn't gone mask off, there's still enough data points where the mask slips a little bit, but there actually might be some transphobia in there. I wouldn't be surprised.
2136000	2145000	And here's what I compare the situation to. We all knew a long time ago that Richard Spencer was straight up a white supremacist. He very rarely outright said it.
2145000	2155000	He was always very kind and very debonair. And he always posited his claims and his views as being not anti-black, but just pro-white.
2155000	2161000	We all kind of got that feeling from him. We didn't really have any concrete proof. The mask hadn't really slipped that often.
2161000	2167000	But we're like, hold on. No, this guy is not what he's saying. This guy is something else. And we all knew it.
2167000	2182000	And then, you know, a few years later, after the downfall of Richard Spencer, we got that absolutely hilarious, ridiculous recording where Richard Spencer in private is like ranting and raving about octoroons and all this like legitimately hateful racist shit.
2182000	2189000	And the reason it was so funny is because it was finally a mascot. It was finally a direct confirmation of what we all knew.
2189000	2200000	Now, we didn't need that confirmation to understand beforehand that Richard Spencer was probably just a big fucking racist. We already understood that the confirmation was just icing on the cake.
2200000	2207000	So I guess my answer to the question is, is J.K. Rowling a mask off transphobe? No.
2207000	2223000	However, if in 10 or 20 years a recording comes out of J.K. Rowling in private ranting and raving about trans women and how much she hates them and thinks that they're like oppressing cis women and abusing them and doing all this crazy shit.
2223000	2229000	If that recording came out, I would not be surprised in the fucking least.
