00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
Back when Mass Effect Legendary Edition dropped, I was actually writing a script for SFO about

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
it.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.280
I figured it would be a good companion piece for the channel, Naomi and I are currently

00:15.280 --> 00:18.680
doing Mass Effect streams, there's a lot of controversies surrounding the game, more

00:18.680 --> 00:22.840
specifically its horrendous quality, but I realized there just wasn't enough wider

00:22.840 --> 00:27.880
scope stuff there that I hadn't already covered in my New Era of Moral Panic video.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.720
The Mass Effect relevant parts of that vid, by the way, are that back in 2007, when the

00:32.720 --> 00:37.160
Puritans of the Religious Right still held some cultural power, Fox News published a

00:37.160 --> 00:43.320
hit piece on the first Mass Effect game, complaining that Liara, a member of the alien, agender,

00:43.320 --> 00:49.160
asexually reproducing asari species, was a romance option for both male and female players,

00:49.160 --> 00:52.800
and therefore the game included a blue booty lesbian sex scene.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.280
Well, not technically lesbian sex, as Liara is not technically a woman, but she looks

00:57.280 --> 01:01.080
like a woman, and that's enough for human sensibilities to call the pairing lesbian.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.600
And hey, the Dorito Pope himself was part of that Fox News segment, making an impassioned

01:05.600 --> 01:07.080
plea on behalf of the game.

01:07.080 --> 01:12.320
This event spooked Bioware so much, that in Mass Effect 2, the obviously bisexual character

01:12.320 --> 01:16.920
Jack had her female romance option taken out of the game, with the final version presenting

01:16.920 --> 01:21.580
Jack to still be bisexual, but not believing Shepard's advances are serious.

01:21.580 --> 01:25.920
That being said, the romance scenes, the voice lines, they did exist, they were recorded

01:25.920 --> 01:28.760
and created, but were ultimately left on the cutting room floor.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.480
And when Mass Effect Legendary Edition was announced, there was a rumor they were going

01:32.480 --> 01:36.240
to restore the romance, but it ended up not happening, I wouldn't have minded, it clearly

01:36.240 --> 01:41.180
fits Jack's character, but Mass Effect Legendary Edition is specifically meant to be a remaster

01:41.180 --> 01:46.120
of the original games, as they existed a decade ago, flaws and all, I respect that.

01:46.120 --> 01:50.640
And then they nerfed Miranda's glorious genetically engineered to be perfect ass.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.240
Well not really, rather they adjusted the camera angles of scenes she was in, so as

01:54.240 --> 01:55.400
not to objectify her.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.400
Okay, fair enough.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.400
It is ridiculous that in this scene, the camera is positioned in this location to get this

02:00.400 --> 02:01.400
angle.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.560
But if the argument for Jack is, release the game as it was, why is this being changed?

02:05.560 --> 02:07.860
Maybe it's because it's easy to do and they didn't really want to put too much

02:07.860 --> 02:08.860
work into the game?

02:08.860 --> 02:13.520
Actually, yeah, that's exactly it, because the remaster is also absolutely fucking ugly.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.880
It looks like they upscaled some textures, lazily slapped in a modern lighting engine,

02:17.880 --> 02:18.880
and called it a day.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.500
No fine tuning, no actual work to make sure things looked good or new components meshed,

02:23.500 --> 02:26.300
just shitted out into the stores to capitalize on the Mass Effect name.

02:26.300 --> 02:30.340
The original graphics do look dated, but they've got a unique style that the remaster completely

02:30.340 --> 02:31.340
ruins.

02:31.340 --> 02:34.260
Add to this that the game itself has been made a lot easier, with combat even on the

02:34.260 --> 02:38.580
insanity difficulty being dumbed down and speech checks requiring a lot less reputation,

02:38.580 --> 02:42.180
and it turns out that Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a trainwreck.

02:42.180 --> 02:44.220
But is that enough for a whole video?

02:44.220 --> 02:47.220
I mean I've already gone over all my gripes and are only a few minutes in.

02:47.220 --> 02:52.180
Well another similar culture war-esque footnote is the recent leaking of the Powerpuff Girls

02:52.180 --> 02:53.180
script.

02:53.860 --> 02:56.820
Powerpuff Girls was a cartoon about a kid superhero team from back in the 90s.

02:56.820 --> 03:00.980
The gimmick was that the girls were overly cute, specifically not sexualized, cute in

03:00.980 --> 03:05.140
the innocent way that kids are, and that despite that cuteness, they had powers on par with

03:05.140 --> 03:09.980
Superman and were tasked with fighting monsters and supervillains while also attending kindergarten.

03:09.980 --> 03:14.580
Because everything's getting rebooted nowadays, a modern Powerpuff Girls series was greenlit,

03:14.580 --> 03:18.340
and it turns out that the girls are now in their 20s, they're washed up, they're

03:18.340 --> 03:20.620
social media sex addict lesbians.

03:20.620 --> 03:24.740
An anime that was clearly meant to be, on some levels, a Powerpuff Girls parody, called

03:24.740 --> 03:29.300
Panty and Stalking, features super-powered high schoolers drawn in the same style, except

03:29.300 --> 03:31.700
in this show they're sex addict degenerates.

03:31.700 --> 03:35.580
And them being in high school makes that at least slightly better than them being in kindergarten,

03:35.580 --> 03:36.580
but it's Japan.

03:36.580 --> 03:40.700
But nonetheless this is a parody, and the Powerpuff Girls became their own parody.

03:40.700 --> 03:45.180
Not only that, but Mojo Jojo, whose entire character revolved around him being a hyper-intelligent

03:45.180 --> 03:49.660
monkey who is iconic for the hyper-intelligent monkey trope second only to the Planet of

03:49.660 --> 03:52.300
the Apes, in the new version has been made into a human.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.900
Professor X is now a black man, which is not that big of a deal on its own, but it turns

03:55.900 --> 03:59.860
out he was also an absentee father to the Powerpuff Girls as they grew older, and also

03:59.860 --> 04:03.060
that he stole Chemical X from Mojo Jojo who was its real creator.

04:03.060 --> 04:07.860
I have no idea why, if you were gunning for woke diversity points, you would blackwash

04:07.860 --> 04:11.340
a character only to also make him a thief and a shitty dad.

04:11.340 --> 04:15.080
The leaked script was wildly ridiculed on the internet, the leaker was apparently fired

04:15.080 --> 04:18.980
and faced legal action, and for a short while the production company was actually issuing

04:18.980 --> 04:22.180
DMCAs on Twitter, for all the good that's doing them because the script's everywhere

04:22.180 --> 04:26.500
now, and the head of CW, Mark Piedowitz, oh god that's a terrible fucking name to be

04:26.500 --> 04:30.420
attached to this story, has vowed to scrap the pilot and get the script reworked, but

04:30.420 --> 04:31.420
the damage is already done.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.720
Again, there's an interesting story here, but I've just given you all the good bits,

04:34.720 --> 04:38.100
and I'm not the kind of person who feels comfortable artificially expanding a video's

04:38.100 --> 04:40.740
length out to ten minutes when the story really doesn't deserve it.

04:40.740 --> 04:45.020
I was also writing a script on the recent Dalmatians trainwreck, but I hit the same

04:45.020 --> 04:47.940
problem, it's not nothing but it's not deserving of a video.

04:47.940 --> 04:52.740
The original 101 Dalmatians was the story of a songwriter and his dog, how they both

04:52.740 --> 04:57.460
meet their partners, man and dog alike, and how an old schoolmate, Carilla Deville, ends

04:57.460 --> 05:00.500
up wanting the puppies of that pairing in order to make a fur coat.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.940
Ridiculous, unbelievable hijinks ensue, and due to the movie's success, Carilla Deville

05:04.940 --> 05:07.900
became an iconic character, a symbol of greed and vanity.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.040
You don't need to have seen the movie to know what this character's all about, her

05:11.040 --> 05:15.140
appearance tells us the story, but not only that, she's become that ingrained into our

05:15.140 --> 05:16.140
culture.

05:16.140 --> 05:33.260
So, what exactly are we talking about today?

05:33.260 --> 05:37.180
Is this just a cynical attempt by me to combine a bunch of disparate scripts I've already

05:37.180 --> 05:40.580
written, in order to recoup some of the work I've put into them, after I realize that

05:40.580 --> 05:44.200
while there is some meat on the bones of these stories, it's not nearly enough to qualify

05:44.200 --> 05:45.800
for their own videos?

05:45.800 --> 05:49.840
Well, yes, but it's not just that, don't turn the video off, there's more to talk

05:49.840 --> 05:50.840
about.

05:50.840 --> 05:55.160
For a long time now, the phrase, get woke, go broke, has been tossed around, and sometimes

05:55.160 --> 05:56.200
with good reason.

05:56.200 --> 06:01.620
For example, Ghostbusters 2016 was such an egregious failure, that Ghostbusters Afterlife

06:01.620 --> 06:05.600
is returning to the original canon and acting like the all-female alternate universe movie

06:05.600 --> 06:10.060
never happened, despite there being an obvious sequel hook at the end of the 2016 version.

06:10.060 --> 06:14.960
And back when that movie came out, YouTube was filled with tons of commentators talking

06:14.960 --> 06:20.060
about how shitty the movie was, how woke it was, how it was radfem, baiting, and man-hating,

06:20.060 --> 06:23.500
how the jokes didn't work, how the acting was terrible, how talking about your vagina

06:23.500 --> 06:26.460
every sentence doesn't actually constitute character development.

06:26.460 --> 06:31.980
But most importantly of all, how Ghostbusters 2016 had assembled all of the pieces of Ghostbusters,

06:31.980 --> 06:34.820
but not into a Ghostbusters movie.

06:34.820 --> 06:39.620
Ghostbusters isn't flashy, impressive action sequences with strong, badass heroes blasting

06:39.660 --> 06:43.780
their proton packs, it's four idiots blowing hot air to a crowd about how they're going

06:43.780 --> 06:47.900
to save the city, and then slowly and impotently climbing the stairwell of the tower because

06:47.900 --> 06:49.220
the elevator's out.

06:49.220 --> 06:53.100
And for me personally, it was a lot of fun to see people who were highly invested in

06:53.100 --> 06:57.820
Ghostbusters 2016 screech that the fans wanted to return to the old canon and the studio

06:57.820 --> 06:59.220
was giving them what they wanted.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.500
Yes, it is like you never existed, and that's for the best, really.

07:02.500 --> 07:07.860
Get woke, go broke is a catchy, pithy phrase, and people who commonly use it point correctly

07:07.860 --> 07:13.140
at Ghostbusters 2016 as proof of its efficacy, but these same people often ignore all the

07:13.140 --> 07:16.300
times in which the phrase should apply, but actually doesn't.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.860
Consider the Captain Marvel movie.

07:17.860 --> 07:18.860
It sucks.

07:18.860 --> 07:22.060
The plot is functional enough to move us from scene to scene, but has nothing to write home

07:22.060 --> 07:23.060
about.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.900
Captain Marvel as a character is overpowered, and her addition to the main Avengers storyline

07:26.900 --> 07:28.180
basically breaks it.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.940
Brie Larson isn't a great actress, but because it was part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

07:32.940 --> 07:37.900
it grossed 1.1 billion dollars, and because it starred a strong female lead, however shitty

07:37.900 --> 07:41.460
she was, both on camera and off, it garnered woke support.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.140
In the same vein, consider the Star Wars sequel trilogy.

07:44.140 --> 07:46.100
They all suck, especially The Last Jedi.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.980
The plot of the whole trilogy is again functional, but nothing to write home about.

07:48.980 --> 07:53.420
The Last Jedi horrifically mangles its section of the story, causing the rise of Skywalker

07:53.420 --> 07:58.100
to have to rush through two movies in one, but as an overarching plot, it's just mediocre.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.140
Rey, like Captain Marvel, is a Mary Sue, and the other characters in the franchise are

08:02.140 --> 08:04.380
either underutilized or wholly mistreated.

08:04.380 --> 08:07.980
The new talent brought in for the roles aren't good actors or actresses.

08:07.980 --> 08:12.700
But again, because it's Star Wars, even the worst movie of the bunch, The Last Jedi, grossed

08:12.700 --> 08:18.420
1.3 billion dollars, and because it starred a strong female lead, it garnered woke support.

08:18.420 --> 08:21.940
You can point at the abject failure of the supplementary materials of these properties,

08:21.940 --> 08:23.820
like the toys, comics, and games.

08:23.820 --> 08:27.820
Say get woke, go broke with a smug on your face, and you'd still have a point.

08:27.820 --> 08:32.100
But, at the end of the day, these stinkers still made money hand over fist.

08:32.100 --> 08:36.220
In fact, I think that's why some YouTubers ended up making, and in some cases still make,

08:36.220 --> 08:40.780
dozens of videos on Brie Larson or Kathleen Kennedy or Star Wars or Captain Marvel.

08:40.780 --> 08:45.560
Because they're really banking on the get woke, go broke thing to be an ironclad rule.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.540
The more they can try and convince their audiences they're slowly winning a culture war, the

08:49.540 --> 08:51.260
better it is for their channels.

08:51.260 --> 08:56.540
Even if they're actually losing that war, or even if, in this instance, such a war doesn't

08:56.580 --> 08:57.700
actually exist.

08:57.700 --> 09:02.780
Pop media, and therefore clickbait YouTube, is riddled with videos talking about reimaginations

09:02.780 --> 09:05.940
of old properties that are getting woke and will surely be going broke.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.860
And I'm not entirely innocent either.

09:07.860 --> 09:12.780
The She-Ra reboot, nicknamed Z-Ra as a play on words regarding her androgynous appearance,

09:12.780 --> 09:16.060
was the topic of a podcast I recorded with Scrump and Dankula back in the day.

09:16.060 --> 09:19.940
I recorded a similar podcast about the Star Wars sequel trilogy, as a donation reward

09:19.940 --> 09:21.020
with a fan.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.440
But beyond just me, there's also Space Jam removing the overt sexuality of Lola Bunny

09:24.440 --> 09:26.100
to the anger of many furries.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.620
The absolutely cancerous Thundercats reboot.

09:28.620 --> 09:32.620
The new Ninja Turtles making yet another ginger character black, this time April O'Neil.

09:32.620 --> 09:35.280
Rugrats' recently announced reboot making Betty a lesbian.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.620
The absolute radioactive waste pile that was Star Trek Picard.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.940
The slightly better, but not really radioactive waste pile that was Star Trek Discovery.

09:42.940 --> 09:46.380
The complete dumpster fire that Game of Thrones turned out to be after they had to start actually

09:46.380 --> 09:47.780
writing their own series.

09:47.780 --> 09:51.160
The rapidly growing landfill of shitty woke video games.

09:51.160 --> 09:56.040
From Battlefield, to Battle Born, to Mass Effect Andromeda, to Fallout 76, to the entirety

09:56.040 --> 10:00.720
of Telltale games, to almost every single indie project out there, the supply of garbage

10:00.720 --> 10:04.640
media that compensates for a lack of talent and originality by injecting wokeness into

10:04.640 --> 10:05.900
it is endless.

10:05.900 --> 10:12.240
And yet, none of this explains why sometimes, Get Woke Go Broke is a rule in full effect,

10:12.240 --> 10:16.760
destroying projects and careers and sometimes entire legacies, while other times the rule

10:16.760 --> 10:20.960
seems non-existent, as Star Wars and Star Trek and Captain Marvel slip on by, gaining

10:20.960 --> 10:24.320
profits and prestige despite being absolutely god awful.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.840
When the Angry Video Game Nerd released a video stating that he refused to see or review

10:27.840 --> 10:32.640
Ghostbusters 2016, the entirety of woke internet descended on him.

10:32.640 --> 10:37.360
City Massacre YouTube critic refused to see Ghostbusters for dumb reasons, AVGN shows

10:37.360 --> 10:41.680
that he was probably one of the thousands of salty fans that made the Ghostbusters 2016

10:41.680 --> 10:45.520
trailer one of the most disliked movie trailers in YouTube history.

10:45.520 --> 10:50.120
The brave, not sexist, movie critic refuses to watch the new Ghostbusters.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.780
And of course, the story rapidly became about everything he'd ever done, the complicated

10:53.780 --> 10:56.400
legacy of the original Angry Video Game Nerd.

10:56.400 --> 11:01.520
And while the culture war was certainly in full swing even back during 2016, AVGN's

11:01.520 --> 11:05.920
video didn't even reference it, it didn't talk about the encroaching wokeness vs misogynistic

11:05.920 --> 11:07.160
nerds divide.

11:07.160 --> 11:11.540
It certainly didn't mention Gamergate, Trump, Brexit, or the alt-right, even though every

11:11.540 --> 11:15.160
single fucking article tried to shoehorn that shit in whenever they could.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.800
AVGN focused on how the movie just didn't look good to him, and he didn't want to

11:18.800 --> 11:21.520
reward studios for making movies he thought were going to be bad.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.120
But he made these comments in the context of a series of events happening within the

11:25.120 --> 11:29.640
film review and amateur filmmaker community that a lot of culture warriors tend to overlook

11:29.640 --> 11:31.520
when discussing Ghostbusters 2016.

11:31.520 --> 11:37.040
In 2009, Star Trek was revived from its sudden death into a new Apple Chrome movie series.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.420
And Terminator came back in a similar way as Terminator Salvation, intending but failing

11:41.420 --> 11:42.620
to start a new trilogy.

11:42.620 --> 11:47.300
The next year, Universal began a series of remakes, doing new versions of its classic

11:47.300 --> 11:51.580
black and white monster films, beginning in 2010 with The Wolfman, and then in 2020 following

11:51.580 --> 11:53.140
up with The Invisible Man.

11:53.140 --> 11:56.980
Also in 2010, A Nightmare on Elm Street received a reboot, as did The Karate Kid.

11:56.980 --> 12:00.580
2011 saw a remake of Footloose, The Thing, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

12:00.580 --> 12:04.180
2012 gave us a remake of Total Recall, Red Dawn, and Judge Dredd.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.260
2013 gave us Carrie and Oldboy.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.700
2014 gave us Robocop and Maleficent.

12:08.700 --> 12:13.220
2015 produced the steaming turd Terminator Genisys, which also failed to start a new

12:13.220 --> 12:14.220
trilogy.

12:14.220 --> 12:16.340
And why'd you have to spell Genesis that way?

12:16.340 --> 12:20.500
2016 and 2018 both produced different versions of The Jungle Book.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.980
2017 gave us The Beauty and the Beast and The Mummy.

12:22.980 --> 12:27.820
2019 gave us Dumbo, Aladdin, The Lion King, Lady and the Tramp, Child's Play, and Terminator

12:27.820 --> 12:33.460
Dark Fate, that last one being most noteworthy for being the third failed attempt in a row

12:33.460 --> 12:35.380
to start a new Terminator trilogy.

12:35.380 --> 12:39.420
The entirety of the 2010s gave us the end of the Christopher Nolan Batman canon, plus

12:39.420 --> 12:45.100
a new canon in the failed DC Expanded Universe, plus another story based on 2019's Joker,

12:45.100 --> 12:48.340
plus the beginning of a fourth canon with Arpats as the Batman this time.

12:48.340 --> 12:49.740
Geez, you think that's enough?

12:49.740 --> 12:54.020
They've been trying and failing to revive Highlander with a reboot since 2008.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.300
I guess there really can only be one.

12:56.300 --> 13:01.060
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them came out to a widespread meh in 2016, and its sequel,

13:01.060 --> 13:05.340
The Crimes of Grindelwald, is the worst reviewed and least profitable Harry Potter installment

13:05.340 --> 13:06.300
to date.

13:06.300 --> 13:10.020
Oh, but wait, it's not Harry Potter, it's the Wizarding World now, since they're also

13:10.020 --> 13:12.860
doing a cinematic universe, just like everybody else is.

13:12.860 --> 13:16.580
Hell, have you seen there's going to be a second Marvel Cinematic Universe, this time

13:16.580 --> 13:17.580
owned by Sony?

13:17.580 --> 13:20.300
Yeah, this one's going to revolve around that other Spider-Man, and it's kicking off with

13:20.300 --> 13:21.300
the Venom movies.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.660
What a clusterfuck.

13:22.660 --> 13:26.820
We have been inundated by a complete and total lack of originality in the filmmaking space

13:26.820 --> 13:28.460
for nearly 15 years.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.660
Reboots, remakes, and side stories have been the name of the game since YouTube began.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.620
A lot of these movies are absolutely terrible.

13:34.020 --> 13:37.380
Some of them are good, but even if they're good, you can only enjoy the same story so

13:37.380 --> 13:38.380
many times.

13:38.380 --> 13:39.940
Films and video games are different in this regard.

13:39.940 --> 13:43.020
With a game, I don't care if I'm playing as the same character with the same story for

13:43.020 --> 13:45.340
each entry in the series, if the game plays good.

13:45.340 --> 13:49.380
With a movie or a TV series, well, there's only so many times you can watch Batman's

13:49.380 --> 13:50.820
parents get shot, you know?

13:50.820 --> 13:54.860
This long list of films I just dumped on you, they span a wide range in both quality and

13:54.860 --> 13:55.860
profitability.

13:55.860 --> 13:59.780
And there's some correlation between those two variables, but it's still not exactly

13:59.780 --> 14:04.500
clear why sometimes a property gets woke and goes broke, and other times, progs join,

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
gather coin.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.700
And there's also an inverse effect, too.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.700
People are so used to the get woke, go broke thing that there's often knee-jerk reactions

14:11.700 --> 14:13.140
to stuff that don't really qualify.

14:13.140 --> 14:18.360
Billy, the terminally online spurg and former owner of One Angry Gamer, went absolutely

14:18.360 --> 14:23.540
nuts that Alucard had sex with a man in the Castlevania Netflix series, loudly exclaiming

14:23.540 --> 14:27.660
that Castlevania was going woke and surely would also be going broke, and that Netflix

14:27.660 --> 14:31.600
wanted to convert all the kids watching this mature audience's anime to homosexuality.

14:31.600 --> 14:36.380
The actual truth was, Alucard is a vampire who hates his vampiric nature, and so, is

14:36.380 --> 14:37.380
quite lonely.

14:37.380 --> 14:40.940
In his loneliness, he's seduced by a pair of twins, no it's not just a guy, there's

14:40.940 --> 14:44.540
also a girl who's involved, and ends up getting sexually assaulted by them, as they

14:44.540 --> 14:46.620
intend to kill him and take his castle.

14:46.620 --> 14:51.740
Billy, in framing this as an OMG kids will see the gays in the TV way, ignored multiple

14:51.740 --> 14:56.620
layers of context, and ultimately became just like the woke scolds, forcing his politics

14:56.620 --> 14:58.340
into a place they didn't belong.

14:58.340 --> 15:01.340
So, what actually is Get Woke Go Broke?

15:01.340 --> 15:05.260
Or rather, if you were to pop the hood on it, what would you see?

15:05.260 --> 15:08.660
Because it cannot be exactly as advertised, there's too many contradictions for it to

15:08.660 --> 15:10.620
simply be Get Woke Go Broke.

15:10.620 --> 15:14.960
Consider Hollow Knight, an indie darling that came out in 2017, and one of my most favorite

15:14.960 --> 15:16.580
games of all time, personally.

15:16.580 --> 15:20.020
Before this game, Team Cherry were nobodies, known for absolutely nothing.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.940
Now, Hollow Knight has sold millions of copies across a wide variety of platforms, and the

15:23.940 --> 15:28.060
sequel, Silksong, is one of the only games coming out that anybody's actually anticipating.

15:28.060 --> 15:32.500
And yet, Hollow Knight has LGBT representation that somebody like Billy would absolutely

15:32.500 --> 15:34.620
rage over, if he had known about it.

15:34.620 --> 15:37.460
The Nailsmith and Nailmaster Sheo are a gay couple.

15:37.460 --> 15:41.640
The Grey Mourner is a lesbian who, as the name suggests, mourns her dead lover.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.660
The reason Billy never raged about it, and conversely, why woke scolds never praised

15:45.660 --> 15:48.260
it, is because Hollow Knight never makes a big deal about these characters.

15:48.260 --> 15:52.340
They don't wave pride flags, they don't have grand speeches about their gayness, they

15:52.340 --> 15:55.540
simply exist as characters in the world, acting as they would.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.040
Their gayness is secondary.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.380
The Nailsmith, as a character, is not known for being a gay rhino beetle, he's known

16:01.380 --> 16:04.020
for being a depressive recluse who upgrades your weapons.

16:04.020 --> 16:08.740
The Grey Mourner is not simply mourning her lesbian lover, she is an ancient being mourning

16:08.740 --> 16:13.420
the fall of the entire kingdom of Hallownest, having outlived everybody she's ever known,

16:13.420 --> 16:14.860
and seen her home crumble to dust.

16:14.860 --> 16:18.620
And if you're thinking it's because the LGBT aspects of Hollow Knight are hidden,

16:18.620 --> 16:22.820
or that it's downplayed by them being goofy bugs and not human beings, instead consider

16:22.820 --> 16:23.820
Celeste.

16:23.820 --> 16:28.440
Launching in 2018, Celeste is a hard-as-balls platform with extremely tight controls, excellent

16:28.440 --> 16:30.620
level design, and high-quality pixel art.

16:30.620 --> 16:35.500
And unlike Hollow Knight, Celeste does not hide its LGBT roots, Madeline is openly trans.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.540
And the game's principal creator, Mattie Thorson, has directly stated that the game

16:39.540 --> 16:43.040
is about the coming out process, with the whole ascending the mountain and battling

16:43.040 --> 16:44.340
your evil self thing.

16:44.340 --> 16:49.020
In fact, after coming out in 2019, it became pretty obvious to everybody that Madeline

16:49.020 --> 16:50.400
is Mattie Thorson.

16:50.400 --> 16:55.520
And despite the game being a giant self-serving wanking circle jerk, the gameplay is good,

16:55.520 --> 17:00.260
the music is good, the level design is good, and the game also sold millions of copies.

17:00.260 --> 17:04.380
Clearly, Get Woke Go Broke doesn't apply to Hollow Knight and Celeste, and the reason

17:04.380 --> 17:06.740
it doesn't is because they're quality games.

17:06.740 --> 17:11.620
Meanwhile Battlefield 5 is absolutely considered a Get Woke Go Broke casualty, despite being

17:11.620 --> 17:16.180
a lot less Woke and Celeste and selling a lot more copies, presumably because its overhead

17:16.180 --> 17:18.620
was so much larger and its failure so much more public.

17:18.620 --> 17:22.260
And of course, Get Woke Go Broke wasn't the death knell of Star Wars or Captain Marvel

17:22.260 --> 17:27.180
either, despite those not being quality movies, so it can't simply be a quality issue.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.820
Maybe it's because larger and more culturally influential properties are given a bit more

17:30.820 --> 17:31.820
slack by fans.

17:31.820 --> 17:35.460
I know Ghostbusters fans don't like to hear it, but as fun as the original Ghostbusters

17:35.460 --> 17:39.740
is, it's not on the same level of cultural relevance as the original Star Wars.

17:39.740 --> 17:43.100
Maybe one Ghostbusters stinker was enough to kill the franchise when you'd need multiple

17:43.100 --> 17:44.100
to kill Star Wars.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.420
On the other hand, we did get five Star Wars stinkers.

17:47.420 --> 17:51.780
On the other other hand, Star Wars was basically dead after stinker number five.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.100
If they had forged on with the Bubba Fett and Obi-Wan movies as originally advertised,

17:55.100 --> 17:57.440
they might have actually destroyed the franchise.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.160
The first season of The Mandalorian seems to have been the life support that Star Wars

18:01.160 --> 18:03.180
as a property so desperately needed.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.180
Same with Star Trek Picard.

18:04.180 --> 18:09.180
That might have been one of the worst fucking TV shows of all time, but its hook was literally

18:09.180 --> 18:12.980
the most beloved character of the most beloved show is back, so I'm not surprised it's still

18:12.980 --> 18:13.980
getting more seasons.

18:13.980 --> 18:17.800
Maybe it's because people are tired of subversion that serves nothing in the story, but simply

18:17.800 --> 18:19.320
done for the sake of subversion.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.600
There's a reason Subvert Your Expectations became a meme after the end of Game of Thrones

18:22.600 --> 18:23.800
and The Last Jedi.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.660
People complained about the new Dalmatians because Cruella de Vil is iconic in her evil

18:27.660 --> 18:28.800
and her greed.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.100
When you subvert the icon, what's left of the story?

18:31.100 --> 18:32.600
It turns out, nothing.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.460
Same with the Powerpuff Girls and their innocence.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.700
Same with Luke Skywalker and his devotion to the force.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.500
I'm not saying there's not a way to do subversion properly.

18:39.500 --> 18:44.200
There is, in fact, a very interesting possible story of an old, bitter Luke Skywalker who

18:44.200 --> 18:46.560
has given up the Jedi way and now lives as a hermit.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.900
But The Last Jedi didn't do the idea justice because it only valued this aversive moment,

18:50.900 --> 18:54.540
the gasp from the audience, and not the coherent aftermath of that event.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.740
That's the same thing with a lot of the properties we've discussed today.

18:56.740 --> 19:01.380
Birds of Prey was 100% built on the subversion without an aftermath model, and that's a big

19:01.380 --> 19:02.900
reason why it was so shit.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.400
The viewer was expected to identify with an objectively terrible main character who mistreats

19:06.400 --> 19:11.160
the reasonable people she comes across, and immediately overpowers any enemies she faces,

19:11.160 --> 19:13.400
making none of them seem like a threat, because girl power.

19:13.400 --> 19:18.120
This same framework also applies, to a lesser extent, to Wonder Woman 1984 and Captain Marvel,

19:18.120 --> 19:20.040
and helps explain why those movies are shitty too.

19:20.040 --> 19:24.360
I'm calling back to my identification with evil video here, where in order to be subversive,

19:24.360 --> 19:28.240
progressives often identify with clearly evil characters, because they oppose what our culture

19:28.240 --> 19:31.840
views as good and our culture as bad, so therefore evil must be good.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.840
Subversive.

19:32.840 --> 19:37.640
Being said, a movie the progs hate, that all the rightoid culture warriors adore, that

19:37.640 --> 19:41.240
also relies on this exact type of subversion, is Joker.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.740
Joker uses all the same tricks as Birds of Prey.

19:43.740 --> 19:48.400
Arthur is a terrible character, he does mistreat people he comes across, and his victories

19:48.400 --> 19:50.640
throughout the movie seem unrealistic and unearned.

19:50.640 --> 19:54.480
Yeah, the final interview with De Niro spawned a bunch of memes, but come on, there's no

19:54.480 --> 19:58.000
way that gun doesn't get discovered at some point by security or something before he gets

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
on stage.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.080
The difference is, the subversion here serves a purpose.

20:02.080 --> 20:06.720
Like with Harley Quinn, we are actually meant to identify with Arthur, but unlike with Harley

20:06.720 --> 20:09.880
Quinn, it's not good that we identify with him.

20:09.880 --> 20:10.880
That's the point of the movie.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.320
We're invited to feel hopeless, not empowered through his actions.

20:14.320 --> 20:18.520
And Joker's messaging is all about mental health stigma, class conflict, shared struggle

20:18.520 --> 20:21.680
and solidarity, all things that should resonate with progressives.

20:21.680 --> 20:26.120
But instead, the woke scolds laughed at white male rage, because maculture war.

20:26.120 --> 20:30.040
Make Joker a black woman with the exact same script, and suddenly the movie becomes the

20:30.040 --> 20:31.680
greatest leftist movie of all time.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.480
And maybe that's the point too.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.800
Joker had a lot of woke going for it in the end, and it did the polar opposite of going

20:37.800 --> 20:38.800
broke.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.240
I think it's clear at this point that wokeness itself does not kill a property.

20:42.240 --> 20:46.200
It's my opinion that wokeness is a secondary effect, a byproduct of something else that

20:46.200 --> 20:48.400
might kill the property, but it's rarely the death blow.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.720
Let's return to Mass Effect.

20:49.720 --> 20:53.320
Remember that gigantic internet shitstorm over Mass Effect 3's terrible ending, and

20:53.320 --> 20:57.860
how the gamer outcry over it was so severe that EA had to promise to patch a new ending

20:57.860 --> 20:58.860
in?

20:58.860 --> 21:02.820
Well, today, right about that event now, they call it a gamergate before gamergate, because

21:02.820 --> 21:05.200
I guess gamergate was their fucking Vietnam.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.900
But let's dissect that event a little bit.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.020
Mass Effect 3 didn't contain any wokeness.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.380
In fact, it contained anti-wokeness.

21:10.380 --> 21:15.560
Joker, a human, and Garrus, a turian, spend time on the Normandy telling each other edgy

21:15.560 --> 21:17.900
racist jokes about humans and turians.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.540
Joker says that this type of banter allows people with genuine differences to come together

21:21.540 --> 21:22.540
as friends.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.800
Banter normalizes rather than otherizes.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.900
If a human can sit with a turian and make fun of each other's performance in the first

21:27.940 --> 21:32.480
contact war over a drink, that does a lot to ensure there won't be a second war someday.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.440
Considering the state of free speech right now, this is probably the most anti-woke message

21:36.440 --> 21:37.960
a video game could present.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.500
Despite Mass Effect 3 containing no wokeness, and despite it doing pretty well in terms

21:41.500 --> 21:45.400
of sales in the end, it's still considered the weakest entry in the original trilogy,

21:45.400 --> 21:48.400
mainly due to its awful plot writing, and that's because a lot of the original Mass

21:48.400 --> 21:50.400
Effect staff had left BioWare.

21:50.400 --> 21:54.940
Junior writers normally tasked with punching up quest dialogue or writing incidental NPCs

21:54.940 --> 21:57.200
were now in charge of the main bulk of the writing.

21:57.340 --> 22:01.820
Mass Effect and Dragon Age both suffered this fate, and not just with writing, but graphics

22:01.820 --> 22:02.820
and music as well.

22:02.820 --> 22:06.320
The people who had made BioWare what it was, who had created Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter

22:06.320 --> 22:10.260
Nights and Coder and Mass Effect, had all moved on, and the new people were not up to

22:10.260 --> 22:11.260
the challenge.

22:11.260 --> 22:14.300
That seems to be another common thread across every example we've discussed today.

22:14.300 --> 22:17.740
On the creative side, the new people are not up to the challenge.

22:17.740 --> 22:21.780
Every show, every movie, every game mentioned in this video that is bankrupted their company

22:21.780 --> 22:25.460
or closed their studio, or just considered to be shit by the fans, are made by people

22:25.460 --> 22:26.700
who are not up to the challenge.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.680
I began to notice this trend when I was listening to the writers' commentary videos of the

22:29.680 --> 22:31.100
final season of Game of Thrones.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.440
These people have no fucking clue how to write a show, and the minute they had to make their

22:34.440 --> 22:36.080
own original work, they instantly failed.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.400
Let me contrast these two approaches for you.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
One.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.000
Axel Braun is a porn director.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.440
He specializes in creating porn of pop culture.

22:43.440 --> 22:47.060
Somebody asked him on Twitter why the costumes in his porn parodies are so good, and he replied

22:47.060 --> 22:48.860
with a simple, because I care.

22:48.860 --> 22:50.560
Look at this, this is for porn, guys.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.360
It doesn't need to look this accurate, it doesn't even need to look good, but when

22:54.360 --> 22:55.820
you care, it shows.

22:55.820 --> 22:57.440
And here's the second approach.

22:57.440 --> 23:01.080
Heavy Metal is an obscure Canadian 80s comic property that made the jump into a goofy B

23:01.080 --> 23:03.580
movie about a silver-haired superhero with big boobs.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.540
The modern variant is… not that.

23:06.540 --> 23:10.360
When asked about it, the current owner of Heavy Metal magazine said, we don't want

23:10.360 --> 23:14.080
fans like you, we're good, thank you, and followed up with, sounds like you have trouble

23:14.080 --> 23:18.320
reading and comprehending there, champ, let's try this, we grew up, sorry, you'll get

23:18.320 --> 23:19.320
there one day too.

23:19.320 --> 23:22.440
The former approach denotes a respect for the source material, including its quirks

23:22.440 --> 23:25.600
and its oddities, understanding that its rough edges and goofy moments are things that

23:25.600 --> 23:26.740
fans love about it.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.660
The latter approach denotes a lack of respect for the source material, viewing it as a name

23:30.660 --> 23:33.700
to be co-opted and used, rather than a property to be respected.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.600
I think this might be the core component.

23:35.600 --> 23:39.060
Ghostbusters 2016 sucked, but it sucked the hardest when it was shitting all over the

23:39.060 --> 23:42.300
original Ghostbusters while still reaping the benefits of using its name.

23:42.300 --> 23:46.440
The new Star Trek shows and movies have ranged from okay to downright abysmal, but have been

23:46.440 --> 23:51.140
consistently at their lowest point when blatantly contradicting pre-established lore.

23:51.140 --> 23:55.680
Star Wars went from captivating trainwreck to downright unwatchable as soon as they decided

23:55.680 --> 23:58.400
everything about the old Star Wars was no longer worth adhering to.

23:58.400 --> 24:02.700
Again, you can go against the ethos of a series and make it good, even great, if you write

24:02.700 --> 24:06.120
an equally good reason, otherwise you're just writing garbage, you're subverting

24:06.120 --> 24:07.840
without writing a satisfying aftermath.

24:07.840 --> 24:11.920
And this is just a hunch from me, but I think it stems from a genuine hatred and jealousy

24:11.920 --> 24:13.600
of the properties these people have inherited.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.400
During the time period we've been discussing, the last 5-10 years, new properties have also

24:17.400 --> 24:21.820
come out, and a lot of them have been shit, Big Mouth, Steven's Universe, BoJack, Stranger

24:21.820 --> 24:25.140
Things, Horizon Zero Dawn, No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077, the list goes on.

24:25.140 --> 24:28.700
I don't expect to be fully agreed with for everything on this list, but I expect that

24:28.700 --> 24:32.960
most people will agree that most new properties are garbage, they contain nothing iconic and

24:32.960 --> 24:36.960
nothing with potential to become iconic, they're largely self-referential and self-indulgent,

24:36.960 --> 24:39.980
and they seem to be the product of people who are also largely self-referential and

24:39.980 --> 24:40.980
self-indulgent.

24:40.980 --> 24:45.480
I think what's going on here is that a lot of these people had their dream movie or game

24:45.480 --> 24:49.620
or whatever, their dream story they wanted to tell, they go into the field of their choice

24:49.620 --> 24:54.020
hoping to tell their dream story, those people who actually did tell that dream story, created

24:54.020 --> 24:58.820
garbage properties, and those people who didn't, but instead got a hold of some beloved property,

24:58.820 --> 25:02.660
wanted to adapt their dream story to fit that property, regardless of how well it actually

25:02.660 --> 25:05.460
fit, and ruined the property in the process.

25:05.460 --> 25:09.180
I think this is why so many of the next generation of creators, when they get put in charge of

25:09.180 --> 25:13.980
a franchise with a huge pre-established fanbase, inevitably bungle it up, and then also blame

25:13.980 --> 25:15.560
the fans for their failure.

25:15.560 --> 25:19.320
They may have grew up with these franchises, but they wanted their dream to stand alongside

25:19.320 --> 25:20.320
these franchises.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.920
They didn't want to be told, no, just go make a new iteration of the original franchise.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.040
That's just my theory though.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.320
I don't have much to back it up.

25:26.320 --> 25:30.540
I'm just noticing the growing trend of people who don't have the experience, the talent,

25:30.540 --> 25:34.700
or the love of a property, getting placed as the head of that property, and subsequently

25:34.700 --> 25:35.700
destroying it.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.620
Sometimes, woke shit is shoehorned in because the new head really believes it, and really

25:39.620 --> 25:41.800
wanted to make their woke show, but this is all they got.

25:41.820 --> 25:45.300
Sometimes, woke shit is used as a cover to distract from the gaping, obvious lack of

25:45.300 --> 25:46.780
talent or experience.

25:46.780 --> 25:47.780
Often times, it's both.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.620
And during this type of takeover event, a property survives solely on the good will

25:51.620 --> 25:55.700
of fans, of how strong their love of the property is, of how many failures they're willing to

25:55.700 --> 25:56.980
tolerate before they move on.

25:56.980 --> 26:01.460
At the end of the day, get woke, go broke is not really a rule.

26:01.460 --> 26:06.260
Wokeness plus genuine talent can still create masterpieces, but wokeness is often a symptom

26:06.260 --> 26:07.560
of a larger problem.

26:07.560 --> 26:11.440
If there's no genuine talent, wokeness is the shield the creator hides behind.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.940
If there is a hatred for the property they're in charge of, wokeness is what it's weaponized

26:14.940 --> 26:15.940
to destroy it.

26:15.940 --> 26:21.100
But wokeness itself, however politically detestable I might personally find it, is not the only

26:21.100 --> 26:23.420
variable that contributes to a property's failure.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.140
And there's also Fuller House.

26:26.140 --> 26:27.460
What the fuck were they thinking?
