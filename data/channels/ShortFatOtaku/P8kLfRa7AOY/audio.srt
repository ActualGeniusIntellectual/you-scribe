1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Back when Mass Effect Legendary Edition dropped, I was actually writing a script for SFO about

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
it.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,280
I figured it would be a good companion piece for the channel, Naomi and I are currently

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,680
doing Mass Effect streams, there's a lot of controversies surrounding the game, more

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,840
specifically its horrendous quality, but I realized there just wasn't enough wider

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,880
scope stuff there that I hadn't already covered in my New Era of Moral Panic video.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,720
The Mass Effect relevant parts of that vid, by the way, are that back in 2007, when the

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,160
Puritans of the Religious Right still held some cultural power, Fox News published a

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,320
hit piece on the first Mass Effect game, complaining that Liara, a member of the alien, agender,

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,160
asexually reproducing asari species, was a romance option for both male and female players,

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,800
and therefore the game included a blue booty lesbian sex scene.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,280
Well, not technically lesbian sex, as Liara is not technically a woman, but she looks

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,080
like a woman, and that's enough for human sensibilities to call the pairing lesbian.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,600
And hey, the Dorito Pope himself was part of that Fox News segment, making an impassioned

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,080
plea on behalf of the game.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,320
This event spooked Bioware so much, that in Mass Effect 2, the obviously bisexual character

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,920
Jack had her female romance option taken out of the game, with the final version presenting

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,580
Jack to still be bisexual, but not believing Shepard's advances are serious.

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,920
That being said, the romance scenes, the voice lines, they did exist, they were recorded

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,760
and created, but were ultimately left on the cutting room floor.

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,480
And when Mass Effect Legendary Edition was announced, there was a rumor they were going

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,240
to restore the romance, but it ended up not happening, I wouldn't have minded, it clearly

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,180
fits Jack's character, but Mass Effect Legendary Edition is specifically meant to be a remaster

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,120
of the original games, as they existed a decade ago, flaws and all, I respect that.

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,640
And then they nerfed Miranda's glorious genetically engineered to be perfect ass.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
Well not really, rather they adjusted the camera angles of scenes she was in, so as

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,400
not to objectify her.

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Okay, fair enough.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,400
It is ridiculous that in this scene, the camera is positioned in this location to get this

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
angle.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,560
But if the argument for Jack is, release the game as it was, why is this being changed?

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,860
Maybe it's because it's easy to do and they didn't really want to put too much

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
work into the game?

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,520
Actually, yeah, that's exactly it, because the remaster is also absolutely fucking ugly.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,880
It looks like they upscaled some textures, lazily slapped in a modern lighting engine,

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
and called it a day.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,500
No fine tuning, no actual work to make sure things looked good or new components meshed,

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,300
just shitted out into the stores to capitalize on the Mass Effect name.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,340
The original graphics do look dated, but they've got a unique style that the remaster completely

40
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,340
ruins.

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,260
Add to this that the game itself has been made a lot easier, with combat even on the

42
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,580
insanity difficulty being dumbed down and speech checks requiring a lot less reputation,

43
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,180
and it turns out that Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a trainwreck.

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,220
But is that enough for a whole video?

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,220
I mean I've already gone over all my gripes and are only a few minutes in.

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,180
Well another similar culture war-esque footnote is the recent leaking of the Powerpuff Girls

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,180
script.

48
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,820
Powerpuff Girls was a cartoon about a kid superhero team from back in the 90s.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,980
The gimmick was that the girls were overly cute, specifically not sexualized, cute in

50
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,140
the innocent way that kids are, and that despite that cuteness, they had powers on par with

51
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,980
Superman and were tasked with fighting monsters and supervillains while also attending kindergarten.

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,580
Because everything's getting rebooted nowadays, a modern Powerpuff Girls series was greenlit,

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,340
and it turns out that the girls are now in their 20s, they're washed up, they're

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,620
social media sex addict lesbians.

55
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,740
An anime that was clearly meant to be, on some levels, a Powerpuff Girls parody, called

56
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,300
Panty and Stalking, features super-powered high schoolers drawn in the same style, except

57
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,700
in this show they're sex addict degenerates.

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,580
And them being in high school makes that at least slightly better than them being in kindergarten,

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,580
but it's Japan.

60
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,700
But nonetheless this is a parody, and the Powerpuff Girls became their own parody.

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,180
Not only that, but Mojo Jojo, whose entire character revolved around him being a hyper-intelligent

62
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,660
monkey who is iconic for the hyper-intelligent monkey trope second only to the Planet of

63
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,300
the Apes, in the new version has been made into a human.

64
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,900
Professor X is now a black man, which is not that big of a deal on its own, but it turns

65
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,860
out he was also an absentee father to the Powerpuff Girls as they grew older, and also

66
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,060
that he stole Chemical X from Mojo Jojo who was its real creator.

67
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,860
I have no idea why, if you were gunning for woke diversity points, you would blackwash

68
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,340
a character only to also make him a thief and a shitty dad.

69
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,080
The leaked script was wildly ridiculed on the internet, the leaker was apparently fired

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,980
and faced legal action, and for a short while the production company was actually issuing

71
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,180
DMCAs on Twitter, for all the good that's doing them because the script's everywhere

72
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,500
now, and the head of CW, Mark Piedowitz, oh god that's a terrible fucking name to be

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,420
attached to this story, has vowed to scrap the pilot and get the script reworked, but

74
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
the damage is already done.

75
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,720
Again, there's an interesting story here, but I've just given you all the good bits,

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,100
and I'm not the kind of person who feels comfortable artificially expanding a video's

77
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,740
length out to ten minutes when the story really doesn't deserve it.

78
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,020
I was also writing a script on the recent Dalmatians trainwreck, but I hit the same

79
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,940
problem, it's not nothing but it's not deserving of a video.

80
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,740
The original 101 Dalmatians was the story of a songwriter and his dog, how they both

81
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,460
meet their partners, man and dog alike, and how an old schoolmate, Carilla Deville, ends

82
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,500
up wanting the puppies of that pairing in order to make a fur coat.

83
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,940
Ridiculous, unbelievable hijinks ensue, and due to the movie's success, Carilla Deville

84
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,900
became an iconic character, a symbol of greed and vanity.

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,040
You don't need to have seen the movie to know what this character's all about, her

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,140
appearance tells us the story, but not only that, she's become that ingrained into our

87
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
culture.

88
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:33,260
So, what exactly are we talking about today?

89
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,180
Is this just a cynical attempt by me to combine a bunch of disparate scripts I've already

90
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,580
written, in order to recoup some of the work I've put into them, after I realize that

91
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,200
while there is some meat on the bones of these stories, it's not nearly enough to qualify

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,800
for their own videos?

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,840
Well, yes, but it's not just that, don't turn the video off, there's more to talk

94
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
about.

95
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,160
For a long time now, the phrase, get woke, go broke, has been tossed around, and sometimes

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,200
with good reason.

97
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,620
For example, Ghostbusters 2016 was such an egregious failure, that Ghostbusters Afterlife

98
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,600
is returning to the original canon and acting like the all-female alternate universe movie

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,060
never happened, despite there being an obvious sequel hook at the end of the 2016 version.

100
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,960
And back when that movie came out, YouTube was filled with tons of commentators talking

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,060
about how shitty the movie was, how woke it was, how it was radfem, baiting, and man-hating,

102
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,500
how the jokes didn't work, how the acting was terrible, how talking about your vagina

103
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,460
every sentence doesn't actually constitute character development.

104
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,980
But most importantly of all, how Ghostbusters 2016 had assembled all of the pieces of Ghostbusters,

105
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,820
but not into a Ghostbusters movie.

106
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,620
Ghostbusters isn't flashy, impressive action sequences with strong, badass heroes blasting

107
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,780
their proton packs, it's four idiots blowing hot air to a crowd about how they're going

108
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,900
to save the city, and then slowly and impotently climbing the stairwell of the tower because

109
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,220
the elevator's out.

110
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,100
And for me personally, it was a lot of fun to see people who were highly invested in

111
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,820
Ghostbusters 2016 screech that the fans wanted to return to the old canon and the studio

112
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,220
was giving them what they wanted.

113
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,500
Yes, it is like you never existed, and that's for the best, really.

114
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,860
Get woke, go broke is a catchy, pithy phrase, and people who commonly use it point correctly

115
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,140
at Ghostbusters 2016 as proof of its efficacy, but these same people often ignore all the

116
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,300
times in which the phrase should apply, but actually doesn't.

117
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,860
Consider the Captain Marvel movie.

118
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
It sucks.

119
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,060
The plot is functional enough to move us from scene to scene, but has nothing to write home

120
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
about.

121
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,900
Captain Marvel as a character is overpowered, and her addition to the main Avengers storyline

122
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,180
basically breaks it.

123
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,940
Brie Larson isn't a great actress, but because it was part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

124
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,900
it grossed 1.1 billion dollars, and because it starred a strong female lead, however shitty

125
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,460
she was, both on camera and off, it garnered woke support.

126
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,140
In the same vein, consider the Star Wars sequel trilogy.

127
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,100
They all suck, especially The Last Jedi.

128
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,980
The plot of the whole trilogy is again functional, but nothing to write home about.

129
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,420
The Last Jedi horrifically mangles its section of the story, causing the rise of Skywalker

130
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,100
to have to rush through two movies in one, but as an overarching plot, it's just mediocre.

131
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,140
Rey, like Captain Marvel, is a Mary Sue, and the other characters in the franchise are

132
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,380
either underutilized or wholly mistreated.

133
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,980
The new talent brought in for the roles aren't good actors or actresses.

134
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,700
But again, because it's Star Wars, even the worst movie of the bunch, The Last Jedi, grossed

135
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,420
1.3 billion dollars, and because it starred a strong female lead, it garnered woke support.

136
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,940
You can point at the abject failure of the supplementary materials of these properties,

137
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,820
like the toys, comics, and games.

138
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Say get woke, go broke with a smug on your face, and you'd still have a point.

139
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,100
But, at the end of the day, these stinkers still made money hand over fist.

140
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,220
In fact, I think that's why some YouTubers ended up making, and in some cases still make,

141
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,780
dozens of videos on Brie Larson or Kathleen Kennedy or Star Wars or Captain Marvel.

142
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,560
Because they're really banking on the get woke, go broke thing to be an ironclad rule.

143
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,540
The more they can try and convince their audiences they're slowly winning a culture war, the

144
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,260
better it is for their channels.

145
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,540
Even if they're actually losing that war, or even if, in this instance, such a war doesn't

146
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,700
actually exist.

147
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,780
Pop media, and therefore clickbait YouTube, is riddled with videos talking about reimaginations

148
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,940
of old properties that are getting woke and will surely be going broke.

149
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,860
And I'm not entirely innocent either.

150
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,780
The She-Ra reboot, nicknamed Z-Ra as a play on words regarding her androgynous appearance,

151
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,060
was the topic of a podcast I recorded with Scrump and Dankula back in the day.

152
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,940
I recorded a similar podcast about the Star Wars sequel trilogy, as a donation reward

153
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,020
with a fan.

154
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,440
But beyond just me, there's also Space Jam removing the overt sexuality of Lola Bunny

155
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,100
to the anger of many furries.

156
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,620
The absolutely cancerous Thundercats reboot.

157
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,620
The new Ninja Turtles making yet another ginger character black, this time April O'Neil.

158
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,280
Rugrats' recently announced reboot making Betty a lesbian.

159
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,620
The absolute radioactive waste pile that was Star Trek Picard.

160
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,940
The slightly better, but not really radioactive waste pile that was Star Trek Discovery.

161
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,380
The complete dumpster fire that Game of Thrones turned out to be after they had to start actually

162
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,780
writing their own series.

163
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,160
The rapidly growing landfill of shitty woke video games.

164
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,040
From Battlefield, to Battle Born, to Mass Effect Andromeda, to Fallout 76, to the entirety

165
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,720
of Telltale games, to almost every single indie project out there, the supply of garbage

166
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,640
media that compensates for a lack of talent and originality by injecting wokeness into

167
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,900
it is endless.

168
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:12,240
And yet, none of this explains why sometimes, Get Woke Go Broke is a rule in full effect,

169
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,760
destroying projects and careers and sometimes entire legacies, while other times the rule

170
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,960
seems non-existent, as Star Wars and Star Trek and Captain Marvel slip on by, gaining

171
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,320
profits and prestige despite being absolutely god awful.

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,840
When the Angry Video Game Nerd released a video stating that he refused to see or review

173
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,640
Ghostbusters 2016, the entirety of woke internet descended on him.

174
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,360
City Massacre YouTube critic refused to see Ghostbusters for dumb reasons, AVGN shows

175
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,680
that he was probably one of the thousands of salty fans that made the Ghostbusters 2016

176
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,520
trailer one of the most disliked movie trailers in YouTube history.

177
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,120
The brave, not sexist, movie critic refuses to watch the new Ghostbusters.

178
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,780
And of course, the story rapidly became about everything he'd ever done, the complicated

179
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,400
legacy of the original Angry Video Game Nerd.

180
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,520
And while the culture war was certainly in full swing even back during 2016, AVGN's

181
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,920
video didn't even reference it, it didn't talk about the encroaching wokeness vs misogynistic

182
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,160
nerds divide.

183
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,540
It certainly didn't mention Gamergate, Trump, Brexit, or the alt-right, even though every

184
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,160
single fucking article tried to shoehorn that shit in whenever they could.

185
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
AVGN focused on how the movie just didn't look good to him, and he didn't want to

186
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,520
reward studios for making movies he thought were going to be bad.

187
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,120
But he made these comments in the context of a series of events happening within the

188
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,640
film review and amateur filmmaker community that a lot of culture warriors tend to overlook

189
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,520
when discussing Ghostbusters 2016.

190
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,040
In 2009, Star Trek was revived from its sudden death into a new Apple Chrome movie series.

191
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,420
And Terminator came back in a similar way as Terminator Salvation, intending but failing

192
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,620
to start a new trilogy.

193
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,300
The next year, Universal began a series of remakes, doing new versions of its classic

194
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,580
black and white monster films, beginning in 2010 with The Wolfman, and then in 2020 following

195
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,140
up with The Invisible Man.

196
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,980
Also in 2010, A Nightmare on Elm Street received a reboot, as did The Karate Kid.

197
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,580
2011 saw a remake of Footloose, The Thing, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

198
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,180
2012 gave us a remake of Total Recall, Red Dawn, and Judge Dredd.

199
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,260
2013 gave us Carrie and Oldboy.

200
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,700
2014 gave us Robocop and Maleficent.

201
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,220
2015 produced the steaming turd Terminator Genisys, which also failed to start a new

202
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,220
trilogy.

203
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,340
And why'd you have to spell Genesis that way?

204
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,500
2016 and 2018 both produced different versions of The Jungle Book.

205
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,980
2017 gave us The Beauty and the Beast and The Mummy.

206
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,820
2019 gave us Dumbo, Aladdin, The Lion King, Lady and the Tramp, Child's Play, and Terminator

207
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,460
Dark Fate, that last one being most noteworthy for being the third failed attempt in a row

208
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,380
to start a new Terminator trilogy.

209
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,420
The entirety of the 2010s gave us the end of the Christopher Nolan Batman canon, plus

210
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:45,100
a new canon in the failed DC Expanded Universe, plus another story based on 2019's Joker,

211
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,340
plus the beginning of a fourth canon with Arpats as the Batman this time.

212
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,740
Geez, you think that's enough?

213
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,020
They've been trying and failing to revive Highlander with a reboot since 2008.

214
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,300
I guess there really can only be one.

215
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,060
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them came out to a widespread meh in 2016, and its sequel,

216
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,340
The Crimes of Grindelwald, is the worst reviewed and least profitable Harry Potter installment

217
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,300
to date.

218
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,020
Oh, but wait, it's not Harry Potter, it's the Wizarding World now, since they're also

219
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,860
doing a cinematic universe, just like everybody else is.

220
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,580
Hell, have you seen there's going to be a second Marvel Cinematic Universe, this time

221
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
owned by Sony?

222
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,300
Yeah, this one's going to revolve around that other Spider-Man, and it's kicking off with

223
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
the Venom movies.

224
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,660
What a clusterfuck.

225
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,820
We have been inundated by a complete and total lack of originality in the filmmaking space

226
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,460
for nearly 15 years.

227
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,660
Reboots, remakes, and side stories have been the name of the game since YouTube began.

228
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,620
A lot of these movies are absolutely terrible.

229
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,380
Some of them are good, but even if they're good, you can only enjoy the same story so

230
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,380
many times.

231
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,940
Films and video games are different in this regard.

232
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,020
With a game, I don't care if I'm playing as the same character with the same story for

233
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,340
each entry in the series, if the game plays good.

234
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,380
With a movie or a TV series, well, there's only so many times you can watch Batman's

235
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,820
parents get shot, you know?

236
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,860
This long list of films I just dumped on you, they span a wide range in both quality and

237
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
profitability.

238
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,780
And there's some correlation between those two variables, but it's still not exactly

239
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,500
clear why sometimes a property gets woke and goes broke, and other times, progs join,

240
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
gather coin.

241
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,700
And there's also an inverse effect, too.

242
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,700
People are so used to the get woke, go broke thing that there's often knee-jerk reactions

243
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,140
to stuff that don't really qualify.

244
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,360
Billy, the terminally online spurg and former owner of One Angry Gamer, went absolutely

245
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,540
nuts that Alucard had sex with a man in the Castlevania Netflix series, loudly exclaiming

246
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,660
that Castlevania was going woke and surely would also be going broke, and that Netflix

247
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,600
wanted to convert all the kids watching this mature audience's anime to homosexuality.

248
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,380
The actual truth was, Alucard is a vampire who hates his vampiric nature, and so, is

249
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
quite lonely.

250
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,940
In his loneliness, he's seduced by a pair of twins, no it's not just a guy, there's

251
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,540
also a girl who's involved, and ends up getting sexually assaulted by them, as they

252
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,620
intend to kill him and take his castle.

253
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,740
Billy, in framing this as an OMG kids will see the gays in the TV way, ignored multiple

254
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,620
layers of context, and ultimately became just like the woke scolds, forcing his politics

255
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,340
into a place they didn't belong.

256
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,340
So, what actually is Get Woke Go Broke?

257
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,260
Or rather, if you were to pop the hood on it, what would you see?

258
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,660
Because it cannot be exactly as advertised, there's too many contradictions for it to

259
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,620
simply be Get Woke Go Broke.

260
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,960
Consider Hollow Knight, an indie darling that came out in 2017, and one of my most favorite

261
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,580
games of all time, personally.

262
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,020
Before this game, Team Cherry were nobodies, known for absolutely nothing.

263
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,940
Now, Hollow Knight has sold millions of copies across a wide variety of platforms, and the

264
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,060
sequel, Silksong, is one of the only games coming out that anybody's actually anticipating.

265
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,500
And yet, Hollow Knight has LGBT representation that somebody like Billy would absolutely

266
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,620
rage over, if he had known about it.

267
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,460
The Nailsmith and Nailmaster Sheo are a gay couple.

268
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,640
The Grey Mourner is a lesbian who, as the name suggests, mourns her dead lover.

269
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,660
The reason Billy never raged about it, and conversely, why woke scolds never praised

270
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,260
it, is because Hollow Knight never makes a big deal about these characters.

271
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,340
They don't wave pride flags, they don't have grand speeches about their gayness, they

272
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,540
simply exist as characters in the world, acting as they would.

273
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,040
Their gayness is secondary.

274
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,380
The Nailsmith, as a character, is not known for being a gay rhino beetle, he's known

275
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,020
for being a depressive recluse who upgrades your weapons.

276
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,740
The Grey Mourner is not simply mourning her lesbian lover, she is an ancient being mourning

277
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,420
the fall of the entire kingdom of Hallownest, having outlived everybody she's ever known,

278
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,860
and seen her home crumble to dust.

279
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,620
And if you're thinking it's because the LGBT aspects of Hollow Knight are hidden,

280
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,820
or that it's downplayed by them being goofy bugs and not human beings, instead consider

281
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Celeste.

282
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,440
Launching in 2018, Celeste is a hard-as-balls platform with extremely tight controls, excellent

283
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,620
level design, and high-quality pixel art.

284
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,500
And unlike Hollow Knight, Celeste does not hide its LGBT roots, Madeline is openly trans.

285
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,540
And the game's principal creator, Mattie Thorson, has directly stated that the game

286
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,040
is about the coming out process, with the whole ascending the mountain and battling

287
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,340
your evil self thing.

288
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,020
In fact, after coming out in 2019, it became pretty obvious to everybody that Madeline

289
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,400
is Mattie Thorson.

290
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,520
And despite the game being a giant self-serving wanking circle jerk, the gameplay is good,

291
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,260
the music is good, the level design is good, and the game also sold millions of copies.

292
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,380
Clearly, Get Woke Go Broke doesn't apply to Hollow Knight and Celeste, and the reason

293
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,740
it doesn't is because they're quality games.

294
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,620
Meanwhile Battlefield 5 is absolutely considered a Get Woke Go Broke casualty, despite being

295
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,180
a lot less Woke and Celeste and selling a lot more copies, presumably because its overhead

296
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,620
was so much larger and its failure so much more public.

297
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,260
And of course, Get Woke Go Broke wasn't the death knell of Star Wars or Captain Marvel

298
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,180
either, despite those not being quality movies, so it can't simply be a quality issue.

299
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,820
Maybe it's because larger and more culturally influential properties are given a bit more

300
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
slack by fans.

301
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,460
I know Ghostbusters fans don't like to hear it, but as fun as the original Ghostbusters

302
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,740
is, it's not on the same level of cultural relevance as the original Star Wars.

303
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,100
Maybe one Ghostbusters stinker was enough to kill the franchise when you'd need multiple

304
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
to kill Star Wars.

305
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,420
On the other hand, we did get five Star Wars stinkers.

306
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,780
On the other other hand, Star Wars was basically dead after stinker number five.

307
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,100
If they had forged on with the Bubba Fett and Obi-Wan movies as originally advertised,

308
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,440
they might have actually destroyed the franchise.

309
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,160
The first season of The Mandalorian seems to have been the life support that Star Wars

310
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,180
as a property so desperately needed.

311
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Same with Star Trek Picard.

312
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,180
That might have been one of the worst fucking TV shows of all time, but its hook was literally

313
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,980
the most beloved character of the most beloved show is back, so I'm not surprised it's still

314
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
getting more seasons.

315
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,800
Maybe it's because people are tired of subversion that serves nothing in the story, but simply

316
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,320
done for the sake of subversion.

317
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,600
There's a reason Subvert Your Expectations became a meme after the end of Game of Thrones

318
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,800
and The Last Jedi.

319
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,660
People complained about the new Dalmatians because Cruella de Vil is iconic in her evil

320
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,800
and her greed.

321
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,100
When you subvert the icon, what's left of the story?

322
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,600
It turns out, nothing.

323
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,460
Same with the Powerpuff Girls and their innocence.

324
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,700
Same with Luke Skywalker and his devotion to the force.

325
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm not saying there's not a way to do subversion properly.

326
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,200
There is, in fact, a very interesting possible story of an old, bitter Luke Skywalker who

327
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,560
has given up the Jedi way and now lives as a hermit.

328
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,900
But The Last Jedi didn't do the idea justice because it only valued this aversive moment,

329
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,540
the gasp from the audience, and not the coherent aftermath of that event.

330
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,740
That's the same thing with a lot of the properties we've discussed today.

331
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,380
Birds of Prey was 100% built on the subversion without an aftermath model, and that's a big

332
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,900
reason why it was so shit.

333
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,400
The viewer was expected to identify with an objectively terrible main character who mistreats

334
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,160
the reasonable people she comes across, and immediately overpowers any enemies she faces,

335
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,400
making none of them seem like a threat, because girl power.

336
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,120
This same framework also applies, to a lesser extent, to Wonder Woman 1984 and Captain Marvel,

337
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,040
and helps explain why those movies are shitty too.

338
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm calling back to my identification with evil video here, where in order to be subversive,

339
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,240
progressives often identify with clearly evil characters, because they oppose what our culture

340
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,840
views as good and our culture as bad, so therefore evil must be good.

341
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Subversive.

342
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,640
Being said, a movie the progs hate, that all the rightoid culture warriors adore, that

343
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,240
also relies on this exact type of subversion, is Joker.

344
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,740
Joker uses all the same tricks as Birds of Prey.

345
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,400
Arthur is a terrible character, he does mistreat people he comes across, and his victories

346
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,640
throughout the movie seem unrealistic and unearned.

347
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,480
Yeah, the final interview with De Niro spawned a bunch of memes, but come on, there's no

348
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,000
way that gun doesn't get discovered at some point by security or something before he gets

349
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
on stage.

350
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,080
The difference is, the subversion here serves a purpose.

351
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,720
Like with Harley Quinn, we are actually meant to identify with Arthur, but unlike with Harley

352
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,880
Quinn, it's not good that we identify with him.

353
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
That's the point of the movie.

354
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,320
We're invited to feel hopeless, not empowered through his actions.

355
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,520
And Joker's messaging is all about mental health stigma, class conflict, shared struggle

356
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,680
and solidarity, all things that should resonate with progressives.

357
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,120
But instead, the woke scolds laughed at white male rage, because maculture war.

358
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,040
Make Joker a black woman with the exact same script, and suddenly the movie becomes the

359
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,680
greatest leftist movie of all time.

360
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
And maybe that's the point too.

361
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,800
Joker had a lot of woke going for it in the end, and it did the polar opposite of going

362
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
broke.

363
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,240
I think it's clear at this point that wokeness itself does not kill a property.

364
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,200
It's my opinion that wokeness is a secondary effect, a byproduct of something else that

365
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
might kill the property, but it's rarely the death blow.

366
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
Let's return to Mass Effect.

367
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,320
Remember that gigantic internet shitstorm over Mass Effect 3's terrible ending, and

368
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,860
how the gamer outcry over it was so severe that EA had to promise to patch a new ending

369
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
in?

370
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,820
Well, today, right about that event now, they call it a gamergate before gamergate, because

371
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,200
I guess gamergate was their fucking Vietnam.

372
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,900
But let's dissect that event a little bit.

373
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,020
Mass Effect 3 didn't contain any wokeness.

374
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,380
In fact, it contained anti-wokeness.

375
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,560
Joker, a human, and Garrus, a turian, spend time on the Normandy telling each other edgy

376
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,900
racist jokes about humans and turians.

377
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,540
Joker says that this type of banter allows people with genuine differences to come together

378
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
as friends.

379
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,800
Banter normalizes rather than otherizes.

380
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,900
If a human can sit with a turian and make fun of each other's performance in the first

381
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,480
contact war over a drink, that does a lot to ensure there won't be a second war someday.

382
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,440
Considering the state of free speech right now, this is probably the most anti-woke message

383
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,960
a video game could present.

384
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,500
Despite Mass Effect 3 containing no wokeness, and despite it doing pretty well in terms

385
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,400
of sales in the end, it's still considered the weakest entry in the original trilogy,

386
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
mainly due to its awful plot writing, and that's because a lot of the original Mass

387
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Effect staff had left BioWare.

388
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,940
Junior writers normally tasked with punching up quest dialogue or writing incidental NPCs

389
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,200
were now in charge of the main bulk of the writing.

390
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,820
Mass Effect and Dragon Age both suffered this fate, and not just with writing, but graphics

391
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
and music as well.

392
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,320
The people who had made BioWare what it was, who had created Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter

393
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,260
Nights and Coder and Mass Effect, had all moved on, and the new people were not up to

394
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
the challenge.

395
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,300
That seems to be another common thread across every example we've discussed today.

396
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,740
On the creative side, the new people are not up to the challenge.

397
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,780
Every show, every movie, every game mentioned in this video that is bankrupted their company

398
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,460
or closed their studio, or just considered to be shit by the fans, are made by people

399
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,700
who are not up to the challenge.

400
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,680
I began to notice this trend when I was listening to the writers' commentary videos of the

401
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,100
final season of Game of Thrones.

402
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,440
These people have no fucking clue how to write a show, and the minute they had to make their

403
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,080
own original work, they instantly failed.

404
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
Let me contrast these two approaches for you.

405
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
One.

406
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,000
Axel Braun is a porn director.

407
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,440
He specializes in creating porn of pop culture.

408
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,060
Somebody asked him on Twitter why the costumes in his porn parodies are so good, and he replied

409
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,860
with a simple, because I care.

410
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,560
Look at this, this is for porn, guys.

411
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,360
It doesn't need to look this accurate, it doesn't even need to look good, but when

412
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,820
you care, it shows.

413
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,440
And here's the second approach.

414
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,080
Heavy Metal is an obscure Canadian 80s comic property that made the jump into a goofy B

415
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,580
movie about a silver-haired superhero with big boobs.

416
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,540
The modern variant is… not that.

417
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,360
When asked about it, the current owner of Heavy Metal magazine said, we don't want

418
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,080
fans like you, we're good, thank you, and followed up with, sounds like you have trouble

419
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,320
reading and comprehending there, champ, let's try this, we grew up, sorry, you'll get

420
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
there one day too.

421
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,440
The former approach denotes a respect for the source material, including its quirks

422
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,600
and its oddities, understanding that its rough edges and goofy moments are things that

423
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,740
fans love about it.

424
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,660
The latter approach denotes a lack of respect for the source material, viewing it as a name

425
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,700
to be co-opted and used, rather than a property to be respected.

426
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,600
I think this might be the core component.

427
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,060
Ghostbusters 2016 sucked, but it sucked the hardest when it was shitting all over the

428
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,300
original Ghostbusters while still reaping the benefits of using its name.

429
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,440
The new Star Trek shows and movies have ranged from okay to downright abysmal, but have been

430
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,140
consistently at their lowest point when blatantly contradicting pre-established lore.

431
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,680
Star Wars went from captivating trainwreck to downright unwatchable as soon as they decided

432
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,400
everything about the old Star Wars was no longer worth adhering to.

433
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,700
Again, you can go against the ethos of a series and make it good, even great, if you write

434
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,120
an equally good reason, otherwise you're just writing garbage, you're subverting

435
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,840
without writing a satisfying aftermath.

436
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,920
And this is just a hunch from me, but I think it stems from a genuine hatred and jealousy

437
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,600
of the properties these people have inherited.

438
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,400
During the time period we've been discussing, the last 5-10 years, new properties have also

439
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,820
come out, and a lot of them have been shit, Big Mouth, Steven's Universe, BoJack, Stranger

440
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,140
Things, Horizon Zero Dawn, No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077, the list goes on.

441
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,700
I don't expect to be fully agreed with for everything on this list, but I expect that

442
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,960
most people will agree that most new properties are garbage, they contain nothing iconic and

443
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
nothing with potential to become iconic, they're largely self-referential and self-indulgent,

444
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,980
and they seem to be the product of people who are also largely self-referential and

445
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
self-indulgent.

446
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,480
I think what's going on here is that a lot of these people had their dream movie or game

447
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,620
or whatever, their dream story they wanted to tell, they go into the field of their choice

448
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,020
hoping to tell their dream story, those people who actually did tell that dream story, created

449
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,820
garbage properties, and those people who didn't, but instead got a hold of some beloved property,

450
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,660
wanted to adapt their dream story to fit that property, regardless of how well it actually

451
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,460
fit, and ruined the property in the process.

452
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,180
I think this is why so many of the next generation of creators, when they get put in charge of

453
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,980
a franchise with a huge pre-established fanbase, inevitably bungle it up, and then also blame

454
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,560
the fans for their failure.

455
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,320
They may have grew up with these franchises, but they wanted their dream to stand alongside

456
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
these franchises.

457
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,920
They didn't want to be told, no, just go make a new iteration of the original franchise.

458
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,040
That's just my theory though.

459
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,320
I don't have much to back it up.

460
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,540
I'm just noticing the growing trend of people who don't have the experience, the talent,

461
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,700
or the love of a property, getting placed as the head of that property, and subsequently

462
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
destroying it.

463
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,620
Sometimes, woke shit is shoehorned in because the new head really believes it, and really

464
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,800
wanted to make their woke show, but this is all they got.

465
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,300
Sometimes, woke shit is used as a cover to distract from the gaping, obvious lack of

466
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,780
talent or experience.

467
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,780
Often times, it's both.

468
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,620
And during this type of takeover event, a property survives solely on the good will

469
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,700
of fans, of how strong their love of the property is, of how many failures they're willing to

470
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,980
tolerate before they move on.

471
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,460
At the end of the day, get woke, go broke is not really a rule.

472
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,260
Wokeness plus genuine talent can still create masterpieces, but wokeness is often a symptom

473
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,560
of a larger problem.

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,420
