0	11280	Back when Mass Effect Legendary Edition dropped, I was actually writing a script for SFO about
11280	12280	it.
12280	15280	I figured it would be a good companion piece for the channel, Naomi and I are currently
15280	18680	doing Mass Effect streams, there's a lot of controversies surrounding the game, more
18680	22840	specifically its horrendous quality, but I realized there just wasn't enough wider
22840	27880	scope stuff there that I hadn't already covered in my New Era of Moral Panic video.
27880	32720	The Mass Effect relevant parts of that vid, by the way, are that back in 2007, when the
32720	37160	Puritans of the Religious Right still held some cultural power, Fox News published a
37160	43320	hit piece on the first Mass Effect game, complaining that Liara, a member of the alien, agender,
43320	49160	asexually reproducing asari species, was a romance option for both male and female players,
49160	52800	and therefore the game included a blue booty lesbian sex scene.
52800	57280	Well, not technically lesbian sex, as Liara is not technically a woman, but she looks
57280	61080	like a woman, and that's enough for human sensibilities to call the pairing lesbian.
61080	65600	And hey, the Dorito Pope himself was part of that Fox News segment, making an impassioned
65600	67080	plea on behalf of the game.
67080	72320	This event spooked Bioware so much, that in Mass Effect 2, the obviously bisexual character
72320	76920	Jack had her female romance option taken out of the game, with the final version presenting
76920	81580	Jack to still be bisexual, but not believing Shepard's advances are serious.
81580	85920	That being said, the romance scenes, the voice lines, they did exist, they were recorded
85920	88760	and created, but were ultimately left on the cutting room floor.
88760	92480	And when Mass Effect Legendary Edition was announced, there was a rumor they were going
92480	96240	to restore the romance, but it ended up not happening, I wouldn't have minded, it clearly
96240	101180	fits Jack's character, but Mass Effect Legendary Edition is specifically meant to be a remaster
101180	106120	of the original games, as they existed a decade ago, flaws and all, I respect that.
106120	110640	And then they nerfed Miranda's glorious genetically engineered to be perfect ass.
110640	114240	Well not really, rather they adjusted the camera angles of scenes she was in, so as
114240	115400	not to objectify her.
115400	116400	Okay, fair enough.
116400	120400	It is ridiculous that in this scene, the camera is positioned in this location to get this
120400	121400	angle.
121400	125560	But if the argument for Jack is, release the game as it was, why is this being changed?
125560	127860	Maybe it's because it's easy to do and they didn't really want to put too much
127860	128860	work into the game?
128860	133520	Actually, yeah, that's exactly it, because the remaster is also absolutely fucking ugly.
133520	137880	It looks like they upscaled some textures, lazily slapped in a modern lighting engine,
137880	138880	and called it a day.
138880	143500	No fine tuning, no actual work to make sure things looked good or new components meshed,
143500	146300	just shitted out into the stores to capitalize on the Mass Effect name.
146300	150340	The original graphics do look dated, but they've got a unique style that the remaster completely
150340	151340	ruins.
151340	154260	Add to this that the game itself has been made a lot easier, with combat even on the
154260	158580	insanity difficulty being dumbed down and speech checks requiring a lot less reputation,
158580	162180	and it turns out that Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a trainwreck.
162180	164220	But is that enough for a whole video?
164220	167220	I mean I've already gone over all my gripes and are only a few minutes in.
167220	172180	Well another similar culture war-esque footnote is the recent leaking of the Powerpuff Girls
172180	173180	script.
173860	176820	Powerpuff Girls was a cartoon about a kid superhero team from back in the 90s.
176820	180980	The gimmick was that the girls were overly cute, specifically not sexualized, cute in
180980	185140	the innocent way that kids are, and that despite that cuteness, they had powers on par with
185140	189980	Superman and were tasked with fighting monsters and supervillains while also attending kindergarten.
189980	194580	Because everything's getting rebooted nowadays, a modern Powerpuff Girls series was greenlit,
194580	198340	and it turns out that the girls are now in their 20s, they're washed up, they're
198340	200620	social media sex addict lesbians.
200620	204740	An anime that was clearly meant to be, on some levels, a Powerpuff Girls parody, called
204740	209300	Panty and Stalking, features super-powered high schoolers drawn in the same style, except
209300	211700	in this show they're sex addict degenerates.
211700	215580	And them being in high school makes that at least slightly better than them being in kindergarten,
215580	216580	but it's Japan.
216580	220700	But nonetheless this is a parody, and the Powerpuff Girls became their own parody.
220700	225180	Not only that, but Mojo Jojo, whose entire character revolved around him being a hyper-intelligent
225180	229660	monkey who is iconic for the hyper-intelligent monkey trope second only to the Planet of
229660	232300	the Apes, in the new version has been made into a human.
232300	235900	Professor X is now a black man, which is not that big of a deal on its own, but it turns
235900	239860	out he was also an absentee father to the Powerpuff Girls as they grew older, and also
239860	243060	that he stole Chemical X from Mojo Jojo who was its real creator.
243060	247860	I have no idea why, if you were gunning for woke diversity points, you would blackwash
247860	251340	a character only to also make him a thief and a shitty dad.
251340	255080	The leaked script was wildly ridiculed on the internet, the leaker was apparently fired
255080	258980	and faced legal action, and for a short while the production company was actually issuing
258980	262180	DMCAs on Twitter, for all the good that's doing them because the script's everywhere
262180	266500	now, and the head of CW, Mark Piedowitz, oh god that's a terrible fucking name to be
266500	270420	attached to this story, has vowed to scrap the pilot and get the script reworked, but
270420	271420	the damage is already done.
271420	274720	Again, there's an interesting story here, but I've just given you all the good bits,
274720	278100	and I'm not the kind of person who feels comfortable artificially expanding a video's
278100	280740	length out to ten minutes when the story really doesn't deserve it.
280740	285020	I was also writing a script on the recent Dalmatians trainwreck, but I hit the same
285020	287940	problem, it's not nothing but it's not deserving of a video.
287940	292740	The original 101 Dalmatians was the story of a songwriter and his dog, how they both
292740	297460	meet their partners, man and dog alike, and how an old schoolmate, Carilla Deville, ends
297460	300500	up wanting the puppies of that pairing in order to make a fur coat.
300500	304940	Ridiculous, unbelievable hijinks ensue, and due to the movie's success, Carilla Deville
304940	307900	became an iconic character, a symbol of greed and vanity.
307900	311040	You don't need to have seen the movie to know what this character's all about, her
311040	315140	appearance tells us the story, but not only that, she's become that ingrained into our
315140	316140	culture.
316140	333260	So, what exactly are we talking about today?
333260	337180	Is this just a cynical attempt by me to combine a bunch of disparate scripts I've already
337180	340580	written, in order to recoup some of the work I've put into them, after I realize that
340580	344200	while there is some meat on the bones of these stories, it's not nearly enough to qualify
344200	345800	for their own videos?
345800	349840	Well, yes, but it's not just that, don't turn the video off, there's more to talk
349840	350840	about.
350840	355160	For a long time now, the phrase, get woke, go broke, has been tossed around, and sometimes
355160	356200	with good reason.
356200	361620	For example, Ghostbusters 2016 was such an egregious failure, that Ghostbusters Afterlife
361620	365600	is returning to the original canon and acting like the all-female alternate universe movie
365600	370060	never happened, despite there being an obvious sequel hook at the end of the 2016 version.
370060	374960	And back when that movie came out, YouTube was filled with tons of commentators talking
374960	380060	about how shitty the movie was, how woke it was, how it was radfem, baiting, and man-hating,
380060	383500	how the jokes didn't work, how the acting was terrible, how talking about your vagina
383500	386460	every sentence doesn't actually constitute character development.
386460	391980	But most importantly of all, how Ghostbusters 2016 had assembled all of the pieces of Ghostbusters,
391980	394820	but not into a Ghostbusters movie.
394820	399620	Ghostbusters isn't flashy, impressive action sequences with strong, badass heroes blasting
399660	403780	their proton packs, it's four idiots blowing hot air to a crowd about how they're going
403780	407900	to save the city, and then slowly and impotently climbing the stairwell of the tower because
407900	409220	the elevator's out.
409220	413100	And for me personally, it was a lot of fun to see people who were highly invested in
413100	417820	Ghostbusters 2016 screech that the fans wanted to return to the old canon and the studio
417820	419220	was giving them what they wanted.
419220	422500	Yes, it is like you never existed, and that's for the best, really.
422500	427860	Get woke, go broke is a catchy, pithy phrase, and people who commonly use it point correctly
427860	433140	at Ghostbusters 2016 as proof of its efficacy, but these same people often ignore all the
433140	436300	times in which the phrase should apply, but actually doesn't.
436300	437860	Consider the Captain Marvel movie.
437860	438860	It sucks.
438860	442060	The plot is functional enough to move us from scene to scene, but has nothing to write home
442060	443060	about.
443060	446900	Captain Marvel as a character is overpowered, and her addition to the main Avengers storyline
446900	448180	basically breaks it.
448180	452940	Brie Larson isn't a great actress, but because it was part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
452940	457900	it grossed 1.1 billion dollars, and because it starred a strong female lead, however shitty
457900	461460	she was, both on camera and off, it garnered woke support.
461460	464140	In the same vein, consider the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
464140	466100	They all suck, especially The Last Jedi.
466100	468980	The plot of the whole trilogy is again functional, but nothing to write home about.
468980	473420	The Last Jedi horrifically mangles its section of the story, causing the rise of Skywalker
473420	478100	to have to rush through two movies in one, but as an overarching plot, it's just mediocre.
478100	482140	Rey, like Captain Marvel, is a Mary Sue, and the other characters in the franchise are
482140	484380	either underutilized or wholly mistreated.
484380	487980	The new talent brought in for the roles aren't good actors or actresses.
487980	492700	But again, because it's Star Wars, even the worst movie of the bunch, The Last Jedi, grossed
492700	498420	1.3 billion dollars, and because it starred a strong female lead, it garnered woke support.
498420	501940	You can point at the abject failure of the supplementary materials of these properties,
501940	503820	like the toys, comics, and games.
503820	507820	Say get woke, go broke with a smug on your face, and you'd still have a point.
507820	512100	But, at the end of the day, these stinkers still made money hand over fist.
512100	516220	In fact, I think that's why some YouTubers ended up making, and in some cases still make,
516220	520780	dozens of videos on Brie Larson or Kathleen Kennedy or Star Wars or Captain Marvel.
520780	525560	Because they're really banking on the get woke, go broke thing to be an ironclad rule.
525560	529540	The more they can try and convince their audiences they're slowly winning a culture war, the
529540	531260	better it is for their channels.
531260	536540	Even if they're actually losing that war, or even if, in this instance, such a war doesn't
536580	537700	actually exist.
537700	542780	Pop media, and therefore clickbait YouTube, is riddled with videos talking about reimaginations
542780	545940	of old properties that are getting woke and will surely be going broke.
545940	547860	And I'm not entirely innocent either.
547860	552780	The She-Ra reboot, nicknamed Z-Ra as a play on words regarding her androgynous appearance,
552780	556060	was the topic of a podcast I recorded with Scrump and Dankula back in the day.
556060	559940	I recorded a similar podcast about the Star Wars sequel trilogy, as a donation reward
559940	561020	with a fan.
561020	564440	But beyond just me, there's also Space Jam removing the overt sexuality of Lola Bunny
564440	566100	to the anger of many furries.
566100	568620	The absolutely cancerous Thundercats reboot.
568620	572620	The new Ninja Turtles making yet another ginger character black, this time April O'Neil.
572620	575280	Rugrats' recently announced reboot making Betty a lesbian.
575280	578620	The absolute radioactive waste pile that was Star Trek Picard.
578620	582940	The slightly better, but not really radioactive waste pile that was Star Trek Discovery.
582940	586380	The complete dumpster fire that Game of Thrones turned out to be after they had to start actually
586380	587780	writing their own series.
587780	591160	The rapidly growing landfill of shitty woke video games.
591160	596040	From Battlefield, to Battle Born, to Mass Effect Andromeda, to Fallout 76, to the entirety
596040	600720	of Telltale games, to almost every single indie project out there, the supply of garbage
600720	604640	media that compensates for a lack of talent and originality by injecting wokeness into
604640	605900	it is endless.
605900	612240	And yet, none of this explains why sometimes, Get Woke Go Broke is a rule in full effect,
612240	616760	destroying projects and careers and sometimes entire legacies, while other times the rule
616760	620960	seems non-existent, as Star Wars and Star Trek and Captain Marvel slip on by, gaining
620960	624320	profits and prestige despite being absolutely god awful.
624320	627840	When the Angry Video Game Nerd released a video stating that he refused to see or review
627840	632640	Ghostbusters 2016, the entirety of woke internet descended on him.
632640	637360	City Massacre YouTube critic refused to see Ghostbusters for dumb reasons, AVGN shows
637360	641680	that he was probably one of the thousands of salty fans that made the Ghostbusters 2016
641680	645520	trailer one of the most disliked movie trailers in YouTube history.
645520	650120	The brave, not sexist, movie critic refuses to watch the new Ghostbusters.
650120	653780	And of course, the story rapidly became about everything he'd ever done, the complicated
653780	656400	legacy of the original Angry Video Game Nerd.
656400	661520	And while the culture war was certainly in full swing even back during 2016, AVGN's
661520	665920	video didn't even reference it, it didn't talk about the encroaching wokeness vs misogynistic
665920	667160	nerds divide.
667160	671540	It certainly didn't mention Gamergate, Trump, Brexit, or the alt-right, even though every
671540	675160	single fucking article tried to shoehorn that shit in whenever they could.
675680	678800	AVGN focused on how the movie just didn't look good to him, and he didn't want to
678800	681520	reward studios for making movies he thought were going to be bad.
681520	685120	But he made these comments in the context of a series of events happening within the
685120	689640	film review and amateur filmmaker community that a lot of culture warriors tend to overlook
689640	691520	when discussing Ghostbusters 2016.
691520	697040	In 2009, Star Trek was revived from its sudden death into a new Apple Chrome movie series.
697040	701420	And Terminator came back in a similar way as Terminator Salvation, intending but failing
701420	702620	to start a new trilogy.
702620	707300	The next year, Universal began a series of remakes, doing new versions of its classic
707300	711580	black and white monster films, beginning in 2010 with The Wolfman, and then in 2020 following
711580	713140	up with The Invisible Man.
713140	716980	Also in 2010, A Nightmare on Elm Street received a reboot, as did The Karate Kid.
716980	720580	2011 saw a remake of Footloose, The Thing, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
720580	724180	2012 gave us a remake of Total Recall, Red Dawn, and Judge Dredd.
724180	726260	2013 gave us Carrie and Oldboy.
726260	728700	2014 gave us Robocop and Maleficent.
728700	733220	2015 produced the steaming turd Terminator Genisys, which also failed to start a new
733220	734220	trilogy.
734220	736340	And why'd you have to spell Genesis that way?
736340	740500	2016 and 2018 both produced different versions of The Jungle Book.
740500	742980	2017 gave us The Beauty and the Beast and The Mummy.
742980	747820	2019 gave us Dumbo, Aladdin, The Lion King, Lady and the Tramp, Child's Play, and Terminator
747820	753460	Dark Fate, that last one being most noteworthy for being the third failed attempt in a row
753460	755380	to start a new Terminator trilogy.
755380	759420	The entirety of the 2010s gave us the end of the Christopher Nolan Batman canon, plus
759420	765100	a new canon in the failed DC Expanded Universe, plus another story based on 2019's Joker,
765100	768340	plus the beginning of a fourth canon with Arpats as the Batman this time.
768340	769740	Geez, you think that's enough?
769740	774020	They've been trying and failing to revive Highlander with a reboot since 2008.
774020	776300	I guess there really can only be one.
776300	781060	Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them came out to a widespread meh in 2016, and its sequel,
781060	785340	The Crimes of Grindelwald, is the worst reviewed and least profitable Harry Potter installment
785340	786300	to date.
786300	790020	Oh, but wait, it's not Harry Potter, it's the Wizarding World now, since they're also
790020	792860	doing a cinematic universe, just like everybody else is.
792860	796580	Hell, have you seen there's going to be a second Marvel Cinematic Universe, this time
796580	797580	owned by Sony?
797580	800300	Yeah, this one's going to revolve around that other Spider-Man, and it's kicking off with
800300	801300	the Venom movies.
801300	802660	What a clusterfuck.
802660	806820	We have been inundated by a complete and total lack of originality in the filmmaking space
806820	808460	for nearly 15 years.
808460	811660	Reboots, remakes, and side stories have been the name of the game since YouTube began.
811660	813620	A lot of these movies are absolutely terrible.
814020	817380	Some of them are good, but even if they're good, you can only enjoy the same story so
817380	818380	many times.
818380	819940	Films and video games are different in this regard.
819940	823020	With a game, I don't care if I'm playing as the same character with the same story for
823020	825340	each entry in the series, if the game plays good.
825340	829380	With a movie or a TV series, well, there's only so many times you can watch Batman's
829380	830820	parents get shot, you know?
830820	834860	This long list of films I just dumped on you, they span a wide range in both quality and
834860	835860	profitability.
835860	839780	And there's some correlation between those two variables, but it's still not exactly
839780	844500	clear why sometimes a property gets woke and goes broke, and other times, progs join,
844500	845500	gather coin.
845500	847700	And there's also an inverse effect, too.
847700	851700	People are so used to the get woke, go broke thing that there's often knee-jerk reactions
851700	853140	to stuff that don't really qualify.
853140	858360	Billy, the terminally online spurg and former owner of One Angry Gamer, went absolutely
858360	863540	nuts that Alucard had sex with a man in the Castlevania Netflix series, loudly exclaiming
863540	867660	that Castlevania was going woke and surely would also be going broke, and that Netflix
867660	871600	wanted to convert all the kids watching this mature audience's anime to homosexuality.
871600	876380	The actual truth was, Alucard is a vampire who hates his vampiric nature, and so, is
876380	877380	quite lonely.
877380	880940	In his loneliness, he's seduced by a pair of twins, no it's not just a guy, there's
880940	884540	also a girl who's involved, and ends up getting sexually assaulted by them, as they
884540	886620	intend to kill him and take his castle.
886620	891740	Billy, in framing this as an OMG kids will see the gays in the TV way, ignored multiple
891740	896620	layers of context, and ultimately became just like the woke scolds, forcing his politics
896620	898340	into a place they didn't belong.
898340	901340	So, what actually is Get Woke Go Broke?
901340	905260	Or rather, if you were to pop the hood on it, what would you see?
905260	908660	Because it cannot be exactly as advertised, there's too many contradictions for it to
908660	910620	simply be Get Woke Go Broke.
910620	914960	Consider Hollow Knight, an indie darling that came out in 2017, and one of my most favorite
914960	916580	games of all time, personally.
916580	920020	Before this game, Team Cherry were nobodies, known for absolutely nothing.
920020	923940	Now, Hollow Knight has sold millions of copies across a wide variety of platforms, and the
923940	928060	sequel, Silksong, is one of the only games coming out that anybody's actually anticipating.
928060	932500	And yet, Hollow Knight has LGBT representation that somebody like Billy would absolutely
932500	934620	rage over, if he had known about it.
934620	937460	The Nailsmith and Nailmaster Sheo are a gay couple.
937460	941640	The Grey Mourner is a lesbian who, as the name suggests, mourns her dead lover.
941640	945660	The reason Billy never raged about it, and conversely, why woke scolds never praised
945660	948260	it, is because Hollow Knight never makes a big deal about these characters.
948260	952340	They don't wave pride flags, they don't have grand speeches about their gayness, they
952340	955540	simply exist as characters in the world, acting as they would.
955540	957040	Their gayness is secondary.
957040	961380	The Nailsmith, as a character, is not known for being a gay rhino beetle, he's known
961380	964020	for being a depressive recluse who upgrades your weapons.
964020	968740	The Grey Mourner is not simply mourning her lesbian lover, she is an ancient being mourning
968740	973420	the fall of the entire kingdom of Hallownest, having outlived everybody she's ever known,
973420	974860	and seen her home crumble to dust.
974860	978620	And if you're thinking it's because the LGBT aspects of Hollow Knight are hidden,
978620	982820	or that it's downplayed by them being goofy bugs and not human beings, instead consider
982820	983820	Celeste.
983820	988440	Launching in 2018, Celeste is a hard-as-balls platform with extremely tight controls, excellent
988440	990620	level design, and high-quality pixel art.
990620	995500	And unlike Hollow Knight, Celeste does not hide its LGBT roots, Madeline is openly trans.
995500	999540	And the game's principal creator, Mattie Thorson, has directly stated that the game
999540	1003040	is about the coming out process, with the whole ascending the mountain and battling
1003040	1004340	your evil self thing.
1004340	1009020	In fact, after coming out in 2019, it became pretty obvious to everybody that Madeline
1009020	1010400	is Mattie Thorson.
1010400	1015520	And despite the game being a giant self-serving wanking circle jerk, the gameplay is good,
1015520	1020260	the music is good, the level design is good, and the game also sold millions of copies.
1020260	1024380	Clearly, Get Woke Go Broke doesn't apply to Hollow Knight and Celeste, and the reason
1024380	1026740	it doesn't is because they're quality games.
1026740	1031620	Meanwhile Battlefield 5 is absolutely considered a Get Woke Go Broke casualty, despite being
1031620	1036180	a lot less Woke and Celeste and selling a lot more copies, presumably because its overhead
1036180	1038620	was so much larger and its failure so much more public.
1038620	1042260	And of course, Get Woke Go Broke wasn't the death knell of Star Wars or Captain Marvel
1042260	1047180	either, despite those not being quality movies, so it can't simply be a quality issue.
1047180	1050820	Maybe it's because larger and more culturally influential properties are given a bit more
1050820	1051820	slack by fans.
1051820	1055460	I know Ghostbusters fans don't like to hear it, but as fun as the original Ghostbusters
1055460	1059740	is, it's not on the same level of cultural relevance as the original Star Wars.
1059740	1063100	Maybe one Ghostbusters stinker was enough to kill the franchise when you'd need multiple
1063100	1064100	to kill Star Wars.
1064100	1067420	On the other hand, we did get five Star Wars stinkers.
1067420	1071780	On the other other hand, Star Wars was basically dead after stinker number five.
1071780	1075100	If they had forged on with the Bubba Fett and Obi-Wan movies as originally advertised,
1075100	1077440	they might have actually destroyed the franchise.
1077440	1081160	The first season of The Mandalorian seems to have been the life support that Star Wars
1081160	1083180	as a property so desperately needed.
1083180	1084180	Same with Star Trek Picard.
1084180	1089180	That might have been one of the worst fucking TV shows of all time, but its hook was literally
1089180	1092980	the most beloved character of the most beloved show is back, so I'm not surprised it's still
1092980	1093980	getting more seasons.
1093980	1097800	Maybe it's because people are tired of subversion that serves nothing in the story, but simply
1097800	1099320	done for the sake of subversion.
1099320	1102600	There's a reason Subvert Your Expectations became a meme after the end of Game of Thrones
1102600	1103800	and The Last Jedi.
1103800	1107660	People complained about the new Dalmatians because Cruella de Vil is iconic in her evil
1107660	1108800	and her greed.
1108800	1111100	When you subvert the icon, what's left of the story?
1111100	1112600	It turns out, nothing.
1112600	1114460	Same with the Powerpuff Girls and their innocence.
1114460	1116700	Same with Luke Skywalker and his devotion to the force.
1116700	1119500	I'm not saying there's not a way to do subversion properly.
1119500	1124200	There is, in fact, a very interesting possible story of an old, bitter Luke Skywalker who
1124200	1126560	has given up the Jedi way and now lives as a hermit.
1126560	1130900	But The Last Jedi didn't do the idea justice because it only valued this aversive moment,
1130900	1134540	the gasp from the audience, and not the coherent aftermath of that event.
1134540	1136740	That's the same thing with a lot of the properties we've discussed today.
1136740	1141380	Birds of Prey was 100% built on the subversion without an aftermath model, and that's a big
1141380	1142900	reason why it was so shit.
1142900	1146400	The viewer was expected to identify with an objectively terrible main character who mistreats
1146400	1151160	the reasonable people she comes across, and immediately overpowers any enemies she faces,
1151160	1153400	making none of them seem like a threat, because girl power.
1153400	1158120	This same framework also applies, to a lesser extent, to Wonder Woman 1984 and Captain Marvel,
1158120	1160040	and helps explain why those movies are shitty too.
1160040	1164360	I'm calling back to my identification with evil video here, where in order to be subversive,
1164360	1168240	progressives often identify with clearly evil characters, because they oppose what our culture
1168240	1171840	views as good and our culture as bad, so therefore evil must be good.
1171840	1172840	Subversive.
1172840	1177640	Being said, a movie the progs hate, that all the rightoid culture warriors adore, that
1177640	1181240	also relies on this exact type of subversion, is Joker.
1181240	1183740	Joker uses all the same tricks as Birds of Prey.
1183740	1188400	Arthur is a terrible character, he does mistreat people he comes across, and his victories
1188400	1190640	throughout the movie seem unrealistic and unearned.
1190640	1194480	Yeah, the final interview with De Niro spawned a bunch of memes, but come on, there's no
1194480	1198000	way that gun doesn't get discovered at some point by security or something before he gets
1198000	1199000	on stage.
1199000	1202080	The difference is, the subversion here serves a purpose.
1202080	1206720	Like with Harley Quinn, we are actually meant to identify with Arthur, but unlike with Harley
1206720	1209880	Quinn, it's not good that we identify with him.
1209880	1210880	That's the point of the movie.
1210880	1214320	We're invited to feel hopeless, not empowered through his actions.
1214320	1218520	And Joker's messaging is all about mental health stigma, class conflict, shared struggle
1218520	1221680	and solidarity, all things that should resonate with progressives.
1221680	1226120	But instead, the woke scolds laughed at white male rage, because maculture war.
1226120	1230040	Make Joker a black woman with the exact same script, and suddenly the movie becomes the
1230040	1231680	greatest leftist movie of all time.
1231680	1233480	And maybe that's the point too.
1233480	1237800	Joker had a lot of woke going for it in the end, and it did the polar opposite of going
1237800	1238800	broke.
1238800	1242240	I think it's clear at this point that wokeness itself does not kill a property.
1242240	1246200	It's my opinion that wokeness is a secondary effect, a byproduct of something else that
1246200	1248400	might kill the property, but it's rarely the death blow.
1248400	1249720	Let's return to Mass Effect.
1249720	1253320	Remember that gigantic internet shitstorm over Mass Effect 3's terrible ending, and
1253320	1257860	how the gamer outcry over it was so severe that EA had to promise to patch a new ending
1257860	1258860	in?
1258860	1262820	Well, today, right about that event now, they call it a gamergate before gamergate, because
1262820	1265200	I guess gamergate was their fucking Vietnam.
1265200	1266900	But let's dissect that event a little bit.
1266900	1269020	Mass Effect 3 didn't contain any wokeness.
1269020	1270380	In fact, it contained anti-wokeness.
1270380	1275560	Joker, a human, and Garrus, a turian, spend time on the Normandy telling each other edgy
1275560	1277900	racist jokes about humans and turians.
1277900	1281540	Joker says that this type of banter allows people with genuine differences to come together
1281540	1282540	as friends.
1282540	1284800	Banter normalizes rather than otherizes.
1284800	1287900	If a human can sit with a turian and make fun of each other's performance in the first
1287940	1292480	contact war over a drink, that does a lot to ensure there won't be a second war someday.
1292480	1296440	Considering the state of free speech right now, this is probably the most anti-woke message
1296440	1297960	a video game could present.
1297960	1301500	Despite Mass Effect 3 containing no wokeness, and despite it doing pretty well in terms
1301500	1305400	of sales in the end, it's still considered the weakest entry in the original trilogy,
1305400	1308400	mainly due to its awful plot writing, and that's because a lot of the original Mass
1308400	1310400	Effect staff had left BioWare.
1310400	1314940	Junior writers normally tasked with punching up quest dialogue or writing incidental NPCs
1314940	1317200	were now in charge of the main bulk of the writing.
1317340	1321820	Mass Effect and Dragon Age both suffered this fate, and not just with writing, but graphics
1321820	1322820	and music as well.
1322820	1326320	The people who had made BioWare what it was, who had created Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter
1326320	1330260	Nights and Coder and Mass Effect, had all moved on, and the new people were not up to
1330260	1331260	the challenge.
1331260	1334300	That seems to be another common thread across every example we've discussed today.
1334300	1337740	On the creative side, the new people are not up to the challenge.
1337740	1341780	Every show, every movie, every game mentioned in this video that is bankrupted their company
1341780	1345460	or closed their studio, or just considered to be shit by the fans, are made by people
1345460	1346700	who are not up to the challenge.
1347000	1349680	I began to notice this trend when I was listening to the writers' commentary videos of the
1349680	1351100	final season of Game of Thrones.
1351100	1354440	These people have no fucking clue how to write a show, and the minute they had to make their
1354440	1356080	own original work, they instantly failed.
1356080	1358400	Let me contrast these two approaches for you.
1358400	1359400	One.
1359400	1361000	Axel Braun is a porn director.
1361000	1363440	He specializes in creating porn of pop culture.
1363440	1367060	Somebody asked him on Twitter why the costumes in his porn parodies are so good, and he replied
1367060	1368860	with a simple, because I care.
1368860	1370560	Look at this, this is for porn, guys.
1370560	1374360	It doesn't need to look this accurate, it doesn't even need to look good, but when
1374360	1375820	you care, it shows.
1375820	1377440	And here's the second approach.
1377440	1381080	Heavy Metal is an obscure Canadian 80s comic property that made the jump into a goofy B
1381080	1383580	movie about a silver-haired superhero with big boobs.
1383580	1386540	The modern variant is… not that.
1386540	1390360	When asked about it, the current owner of Heavy Metal magazine said, we don't want
1390360	1394080	fans like you, we're good, thank you, and followed up with, sounds like you have trouble
1394080	1398320	reading and comprehending there, champ, let's try this, we grew up, sorry, you'll get
1398320	1399320	there one day too.
1399320	1402440	The former approach denotes a respect for the source material, including its quirks
1402440	1405600	and its oddities, understanding that its rough edges and goofy moments are things that
1405600	1406740	fans love about it.
1406740	1410660	The latter approach denotes a lack of respect for the source material, viewing it as a name
1410660	1413700	to be co-opted and used, rather than a property to be respected.
1413700	1415600	I think this might be the core component.
1415600	1419060	Ghostbusters 2016 sucked, but it sucked the hardest when it was shitting all over the
1419060	1422300	original Ghostbusters while still reaping the benefits of using its name.
1422300	1426440	The new Star Trek shows and movies have ranged from okay to downright abysmal, but have been
1426440	1431140	consistently at their lowest point when blatantly contradicting pre-established lore.
1431140	1435680	Star Wars went from captivating trainwreck to downright unwatchable as soon as they decided
1435680	1438400	everything about the old Star Wars was no longer worth adhering to.
1438400	1442700	Again, you can go against the ethos of a series and make it good, even great, if you write
1442700	1446120	an equally good reason, otherwise you're just writing garbage, you're subverting
1446120	1447840	without writing a satisfying aftermath.
1447840	1451920	And this is just a hunch from me, but I think it stems from a genuine hatred and jealousy
1451920	1453600	of the properties these people have inherited.
1453600	1457400	During the time period we've been discussing, the last 5-10 years, new properties have also
1457400	1461820	come out, and a lot of them have been shit, Big Mouth, Steven's Universe, BoJack, Stranger
1461820	1465140	Things, Horizon Zero Dawn, No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077, the list goes on.
1465140	1468700	I don't expect to be fully agreed with for everything on this list, but I expect that
1468700	1472960	most people will agree that most new properties are garbage, they contain nothing iconic and
1472960	1476960	nothing with potential to become iconic, they're largely self-referential and self-indulgent,
1476960	1479980	and they seem to be the product of people who are also largely self-referential and
1479980	1480980	self-indulgent.
1480980	1485480	I think what's going on here is that a lot of these people had their dream movie or game
1485480	1489620	or whatever, their dream story they wanted to tell, they go into the field of their choice
1489620	1494020	hoping to tell their dream story, those people who actually did tell that dream story, created
1494020	1498820	garbage properties, and those people who didn't, but instead got a hold of some beloved property,
1498820	1502660	wanted to adapt their dream story to fit that property, regardless of how well it actually
1502660	1505460	fit, and ruined the property in the process.
1505460	1509180	I think this is why so many of the next generation of creators, when they get put in charge of
1509180	1513980	a franchise with a huge pre-established fanbase, inevitably bungle it up, and then also blame
1513980	1515560	the fans for their failure.
1515560	1519320	They may have grew up with these franchises, but they wanted their dream to stand alongside
1519320	1520320	these franchises.
1520320	1523920	They didn't want to be told, no, just go make a new iteration of the original franchise.
1523920	1525040	That's just my theory though.
1525040	1526320	I don't have much to back it up.
1526320	1530540	I'm just noticing the growing trend of people who don't have the experience, the talent,
1530540	1534700	or the love of a property, getting placed as the head of that property, and subsequently
1534700	1535700	destroying it.
1535700	1539620	Sometimes, woke shit is shoehorned in because the new head really believes it, and really
1539620	1541800	wanted to make their woke show, but this is all they got.
1541820	1545300	Sometimes, woke shit is used as a cover to distract from the gaping, obvious lack of
1545300	1546780	talent or experience.
1546780	1547780	Often times, it's both.
1547780	1551620	And during this type of takeover event, a property survives solely on the good will
1551620	1555700	of fans, of how strong their love of the property is, of how many failures they're willing to
1555700	1556980	tolerate before they move on.
1556980	1561460	At the end of the day, get woke, go broke is not really a rule.
1561460	1566260	Wokeness plus genuine talent can still create masterpieces, but wokeness is often a symptom
1566260	1567560	of a larger problem.
1567560	1571440	If there's no genuine talent, wokeness is the shield the creator hides behind.
1571440	1574940	If there is a hatred for the property they're in charge of, wokeness is what it's weaponized
1574940	1575940	to destroy it.
1575940	1581100	But wokeness itself, however politically detestable I might personally find it, is not the only
1581100	1583420	variable that contributes to a property's failure.
1583420	1586140	And there's also Fuller House.
1586140	1587460	What the fuck were they thinking?
