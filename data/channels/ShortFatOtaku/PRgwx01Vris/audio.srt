00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
My guest of honor here is today.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,300
Let's bring him on.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello.

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,200
Can you hear me?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello.

6
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,400
Oh, you are super low.

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,100
Can you

8
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,600
wait?

9
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,300
Am I low?

10
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,300
Yeah, you're super low.

11
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,000
It's hard to hear you.

12
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
How is that possible?

13
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,400
What do you have me set to on your end?

14
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,300
Let me look.

15
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,500
You're at a hundred and fifty percent.

16
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
I could turn you to two hundred.

17
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,100
Well, hold on.

18
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,400
Hold on.

19
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,100
I'll adjust some things.

20
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,600
Give me a second.

21
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay.

22
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,400
Yeah.

23
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,800
Well, yeah, he's a he's getting ready.

24
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
He's getting his tech stuff done gang.

25
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,400
Don't worry.

26
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,800
Just to let you know.

27
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,000
This is a call-in show.

28
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,800
So if you'd like to call in and talk to us about anything that you have on your mind,

29
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,300
anything you've seen either of us produce or an opinion.

30
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,700
We've stated that you want to talk to us about is more.

31
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,100
You're more than welcome to jump on.

32
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,100
I'll put the discord link in my chats.

33
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,500
You click that link.

34
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,200
You accept the rules.

35
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,400
You jump backstage will pull you in get in line backstage.

36
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,300
If too many people get in line, which sometimes happens.

37
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,400
I'll try to go in the order that I see you come in, but you know, I'll do my best.

38
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,400
It's not okay.

39
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
How do I sound now?

40
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
Oh, you sound much better.

41
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,600
I don't know what you changed, but I can hear you now.

42
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,300
So this is way too loud from my usual recording.

43
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,800
So I have to remember to turn it back down.

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
So I thought that we're gonna move is showing up.

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Has she bailed?

46
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,500
I don't think so.

47
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,100
I talked to her this morning.

48
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,100
She's having a date night with her husband, but she's going to try to call in.

49
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,200
We'll see, right?

50
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,800
I don't know how that works, but we'll see.

51
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,100
I hope she gets here.

52
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,800
So let me send her a quick little message.

53
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:52,400
Yeah, when you approached me for this I was like, I have no clue why you'd want to do this because there's no set topic and I'm not an interesting person on my own.

54
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,500
What are you talking about?

55
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes, you are.

56
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,400
My videos are interesting, but I'm not interesting.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Why do you why do you hate yourself like this?

58
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,400
Like if I didn't think you were interesting, I wouldn't invite you on.

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,500
I don't hate myself.

60
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,400
I just know where my strengths and weaknesses are.

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:18,600
Well, let's interrogate this a little bit like so I see you all the time have conversations with people hours long and people tune in people watch people view it.

62
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,400
What what what why is this different right?

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Like there's several things that we could talk about like the Jew tunnels.

64
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
We have to I have to get your opinion, right?

65
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,800
I have no clue what's going on with that man.

66
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:42,800
It there's going to be some great memes that come out of it and we're probably going to see that video of that one Jewish guy climbing out of the sewer grate that's going to be reposted for the next 50 years.

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm sure.

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, but I don't know.

69
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,000
Did you see that?

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I have I don't know that I don't know the main story there.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Like I've heard some people say that like that the tunnel is actually run to was it a children's hospital or an orphanage or something and they're having sex with kids down there and like I don't know I've seen so much wacky stuff.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,200
I don't know what's true and I think the story is too new to know what's really true just yet.

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,500
No, I agree with you.

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,300
It's it's a it's something that they're going to investigate.

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,000
We're going to find out in the future.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,900
But you're right.

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,600
The means are super funny.

78
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:31,100
And there's a small little interaction I saw on Twitter a while ago about a man in New York City who was complaining on Twitter that he was hearing Yiddish underneath his bed at night, right?

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Like it sounded like there was Jewish people digging tunnels and he was tweeting about this in November, right?

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:46,900
And no one believes everyone thought he was just lying like he was this this huge anti-semite and I just I don't know.

81
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:56,500
I can't get it out of my head where I have this image of this guy who's like legit hearing digging sounds underneath and he's trying to tell people but no one believes them.

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,100
They all think he's just making it up to me.

83
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,600
I don't know that's peak funny, but you know, maybe I'm wrong.

84
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,700
Maybe I'm built different.

85
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,900
I don't know but I can't stop laughing at it.

86
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,800
So I don't know that is that is pretty funny.

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:20,700
Yeah, like I've seen a few people claim that the New York Police rather than investigate it are just filling the tunnels with concrete and trying to like hope everyone forgets about it.

88
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
I don't know if that's true.

89
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:37,800
I don't I don't know what anything about this like I think we'll have to wait a little bit to see what happens if we wait a month and no one said a single peep and the and the police aren't commenting then maybe you can talk about how it might be some sort of a conspiracy but right now it's probably too soon to tell.

90
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,900
Maybe I don't know.

91
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:53,700
It's a so the rumor I've heard the more reasonable rumor I've heard is that they built these during the covid during the lockdowns because they still wanted to get to their synagogue, right?

92
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,100
They would they wanted to congregate even during the covid lockdown, but I'm not sure how true that is.

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,300
It's just something I've heard so we'll see.

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,900
It's possible.

95
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, possible.

96
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,800
Like I said, we'll see.

97
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:16,000
It's and yes, there's a lot of anti-semitism a lot of like sex with kids conspiracies and stuff and coming out of this but it's still funny.

98
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,800
So I can't I don't know.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,500
It is pretty funny.

100
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,100
Yeah, but I'm getting I'm gonna try to find it.

101
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,500
Hold on.

102
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
Give me just a second.

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,100
A surprisingly good resource for this stuff is actually know your meme.

104
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,800
Really?

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, because they do document means they also document at least some of the context behind them.

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,300
I wouldn't just trust them, but they sometimes have things that others don't.

107
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,400
So for example, here I'll DM you this.

108
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Let's see what you got.

109
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,600
So I always take Twitter headlines of the grain of salt, right?

110
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,000
Like for example, this guy is claiming that the other tunnels are being sealed off by the police, right?

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,500
It's like well, maybe.

112
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:17,200
Well, I did see I did see video of them like the one of the sewer grates welding it shut again.

113
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,700
I have no I have no idea.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
This yeah, I don't know how true this is either.

115
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,000
It is interesting though.

116
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,000
And unfortunately, it's going to feed into a lot of stereotypes.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
We'll see how it goes, right?

118
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,500
We'll see how it goes.

119
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
But this is a call-in show.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So I just wanted to let my members know if you want to call in and talk to us.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,700
You absolutely can.

122
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,900
Thank you for the super chats, by the way.

123
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,700
Thank you to Zephyrhash.

124
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,300
Nobody believes me when I hear wick in my walls.

125
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,100
Well, what they'll never find my Donald's buddy.

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
They'll never I'm too clever.

127
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,700
Okay, and Jacob for $5 says I know a lot about the community and can speak to this with confident knowledge.

128
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Risky risky caller, but if you want to call in and then and tell us how much you know about the Jewish community like this could go one of two ways.

129
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:27,800
You could be deeply involved Hasidic Jew yourself or you could you could know what they are thinking and what they don't want you to know.

130
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,900
I don't know but you can absolutely call in and talk to us.

131
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,500
We do have a caller someone you and I both know and love.

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,200
I'll give you a second.

133
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Our friend art of a spell.

134
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,100
Hi Artemis.

135
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,700
How's it going?

136
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,500
Not bad.

137
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,700
How are you doing?

138
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,100
Good.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,700
So we're going with the Jewish tunnels as a topic or you you're the caller you get to talk to us about you want to talk about the Jewish tunnels.

140
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm out mine, but it's not going to be as entertaining as a one might think.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Well, actually here do you usually you have some secret glowy knowledge.

142
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
So tell us about the Jewish tunnels Artemis.

143
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:36,900
Well, what do you know for starters the city of New York City has been at war with the city Jewish population ever since covid lockdown started speak specifically their shops and stores and stuff were like brutally like broken into by police because they were serving people.

144
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,300
And getting them all shut down by by the city.

145
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:52,200
I wouldn't be surprised to be honest, I think I think a lot of let's say more more religiously radical communities really bucked against the covid lockdown.

146
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
So makes sense.

147
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Yeah, the it's actually so notorious that they were going after Hasidic Jewish population that they were filing complaints that they were targeting them specifically because of their ethnicity and religion.

148
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,000
That was early on with this tunnel thing.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:28,200
I have heard about the child accusations and that comes from like an interview with a potential victim from a year or two ago claiming they were taken into tunnels and forced to do whatever on stained mattresses.

150
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:37,500
And then you see from this tunnel thing that you seeing these weird cheap ass matches being pulled out of the tunnels and they're just stained all hell.

151
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,000
So I think that's where they're pulling that from.

152
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Yeah, that's such a such a loose connection for session.

153
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,500
It is but that's but that's the internet.

154
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,100
It's going to they're going to be connections drawn like that.

155
00:09:49,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Well, here's the thing, like if you've ever done any sort of urban exploration, like into an abandoned building or into a like a sewer or a pipe or something that's big enough to hold people or or you go to like some isolated area, even out in the woods, you will eventually find just a dirty mattress.

156
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,300
And what it usually is is a homeless person was squatting there for a while, you know, it's usually not some sort of weird sex cult.

157
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,500
It's usually a homeless person who dug a mattress out of a dumpster and drag it into a tunnel and has been sleeping there for a bit.

158
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay, yeah, but this is this is the tunnels that are like run and maintained by the Hasidic Jewish population of this.

159
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
Yeah, of this.

160
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,600
I don't know.

161
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,900
It's just like, look, I know people who have stained mattresses in their in their actual house, right?

162
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,900
Yeah, I think to my knowledge, they're not kidnapping kids, right?

163
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:46,100
To my knowledge, the bigger story is why is the NYC Police Department immediately going in and trying to fill the fucking tunnels of concrete without first removing everybody from them?

164
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,000
Is it concrete?

165
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,100
I've seen them.

166
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,700
I've seen them weld some of the entrances.

167
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,900
They've been they've been pouring concrete.

168
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,600
They try to pour concrete into the tunnels.

169
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,700
Is there proof of that?

170
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Let me go find one of the images of the the concrete slurry that was poured and then thought.

171
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:12,100
Well, yeah, but it does kind of make sense that they would start welding some of the some of the entrances because you don't want people on the street falling into them and make that make sense.

172
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Yeah, they they were the Jewish were breaking the pipes.

173
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,500
They were using the pipe the pump the concrete in the bike like breaking the tubing.

174
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:31,700
So let me go find that if I also it does make sense, right that they would try to because digging under the foundations of houses and structure.

175
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,600
It can't be good for the stability of those structures, right?

176
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,300
It can't.

177
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,700
Yeah.

178
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Also also we're you got to put up that image IDM.

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,700
Do you bring that up?

180
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Give me a second.

181
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,700
Hold on.

182
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
I am I'm okay gang.

183
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm very bad at tech, but we will make this happen.

184
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,600
Boom boom boom.

185
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,900
Let's see.

186
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,700
Let me find the get the correct.

187
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,500
I'm pretty sure it should be immediately the first things I find.

188
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,800
Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to show it to you without like exposing.

189
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,000
All my tabs and bullshit like that.

190
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,400
Oh my God, someone made a D&D rule set called Talmud's and tunnels.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Again, the memes are going to be they're going to be a lot and they're going to be amazingly good.

192
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,500
Okay, let's see if this works.

193
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Oh, let me get this off the cameras flickering.

194
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:35,900
Yeah.

195
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,100
Yeah.

196
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,800
What's going on?

197
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,500
Can we can we see this gang?

198
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,000
Can we see the teenage Jewish Turtles or whatever they got up here?

199
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,300
What tabs do I have with don't worry about my tabs.

200
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay, don't worry about my tabs.

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,200
Don't worry about my being going to reveal all the DMS right?

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, let's not let's not talk about it.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,700
Okay, let's you know what?

204
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,700
Okay, everyone saw it.

205
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Everyone got a good little good little look.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,300
Yeah, it was good.

207
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
This is only the beginning.

208
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
This is only beginning there.

209
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,400
We're going to be mining for memes in the Jewish mines for a while and it'll be great.

210
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:25,900
But you made some you made a claim earlier Artemis that they were doing it before everyone got out of the got out of the system.

211
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Yeah, do you have anything to corroborate that?

212
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,400
Yeah, I do because they had the police haven't gone into the tunnels yet.

213
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,300
What do you mean?

214
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,400
Let me the police have not gone into the tunnels yet.

215
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,900
There's still fighting the the Jewish people at the temple and then trying to board up the hole.

216
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,900
So you're saying that they're they're closing the tunnel all the tunnel entrance without actually going in themselves.

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Yeah.

218
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,900
Yeah, there's no proof that they've looked at any of the tunnels they they've started filling them.

219
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,000
So that the issue with that is is that regardless of what that there's anybody in there.

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
They haven't looked.

221
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,500
Well, did you find proof that they're filling them yet?

222
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,100
Yeah.

223
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,700
Hold on.

224
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,900
No problem.

225
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,700
Give them a minute.

226
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:16,100
You know me, you know me results come up when I look for Jewish tunnels and concrete Hamas is still a thing, right?

227
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,500
No, I know I get it.

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,200
They learn from the best.

229
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,800
That's how they learn.

230
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,300
Oh God.

231
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,200
There's a Hogwarts meme of the the first movie.

232
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,600
The tunnels and the ring into the house pretty funny.

233
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,000
I thought you shouldn't know and then passes out.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,600
Yeah, here's some some the WIC community members suggestion the Juni to the center of the earth.

235
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,900
No, that's pretty bad game.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,300
Okay.

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,300
Did I even like it when it pops through my thing?

238
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Okay.

239
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,900
Well, it's usually something I like when when I see it, but I'll try to find it and give it to you.

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Sure.

241
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,900
What I actually came on here for please is to ask wick that some things and then maybe dev can chime in later.

242
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Okay, if you have a process that leads to a guilty verdict that was founded upon corrupt methods and driving evidence through corrupt methods in illegal in illegal ways with the verdict should the verdict stand.

243
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, when you phrase it like that, no fruit from the poison tree there are reasons why the method is important.

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,700
Like for example, Bill Cosby Bill Cosby.

245
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,600
He probably is guilty of what he did.

246
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:43,500
Okay, let's not mince words, but what they did to get the verdict like how they extracted his testimony violated his rights.

247
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,100
And so we can't let that stand.

248
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,300
Yeah, so do you know here's a another question and then I'll get the actual point.

249
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Do you know the difference between White House Council and Special Counsel is not not taught my head.

250
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Nope.

251
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,000
So White House Council is the council directly for the president.

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So the attorney the attorney directly to the president sure a special counsel is a an attorney that has been selected by the DOJ or appointed by the or whoever in through their through the systems method to have a like immunity from interference to go after a certain thing or whatever.

253
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:19,900
Right?

254
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,000
Those are two very different things.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,600
Okay, right.

256
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:37,800
Okay, so I got a question for you for the Fulton County DA Fannie Willis who has a point who apparently appointed her inexperienced lover as the lead prosecutor for Donald Trump's Rico case.

257
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,100
What do you think about that?

258
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,200
I don't know what think about it friend.

259
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,200
I can't comment on it until I look into it, right?

260
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,100
Like if you're just saying that it is like this is filed.

261
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Is it nepotism?

262
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,300
Are you is that the accusation here?

263
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,100
Well, definitely it would be nepotism because there are several hundred different lawyers and attorneys.

264
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Sure, but when we talk about like corrupt processes, yeah, I don't that's that's not what I mean, right them appointing a their cousin or brother or something to be the council that is an ethics violation and probably should be looked or potentially one I should say it could be looked into.

265
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,400
But I don't think it violates anyone's rights or affects the evidence.

266
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,300
None of that.

267
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:24,900
What do you think?

268
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,600
What happens?

269
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,200
Okay, go ahead Dev.

270
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's hear it.

271
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,100
Hold on.

272
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
No, you go ahead.

273
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,100
Give me a second.

274
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,600
Okay.

275
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:45,100
So the second part is going to be what if that person that was that is the lover that is inexperienced meets with the White House counsel during their prosecution investigation.

276
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,300
Um, look, I don't I don't know how normal that is.

277
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,100
Biden's attorneys.

278
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Sure, but I don't know if that's a that's necessary.

279
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,600
Like don't the the adversarial attorneys meet all the time to discuss courtship.

280
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,100
Is that?

281
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,400
No, no, no, you're making this is not an app.

282
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
This is not an adversarial.

283
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,600
This is not Trump's White House counsel.

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,900
This is the Biden administration's White House counsel.

285
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,200
Okay, what's wrong with that?

286
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Yeah, that's not that's not that's not legal.

287
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:23,900
Oh, I understand but because it'd be coordinating with the political opponents to prosecute somebody.

288
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,200
That's what would be the illusion of it because for a fair trial, right?

289
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,400
You're supposed to avoid even the like image of corruption and bias.

290
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,000
Right?

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,300
Huh?

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,400
Okay.

293
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,700
This is well and true beyond that at the at this point in time.

294
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,500
I'll have to look into it.

295
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,800
I'll have to get more information on that.

296
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:56,000
But yeah, if it if it was an ethics violation or if it was illegal, it was criminal should be prosecuted and should be looked into and it could affect the ruling.

297
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Absolutely.

298
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Oh stupid.

299
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,100
Oh, it's the wick wick.

300
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,000
I sent you an article you can just read it really quickly here.

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:11,300
Trump co-defendant alleges improper relationship between Fannie Willis and fellow Georgia prosecutor in a filing seeking to dismiss the charges.

302
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,200
Michael Roman's attorney accused Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade of having a romantic relationship.

303
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,700
This is what you're talking about, right?

304
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,700
It's not an accusation.

305
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:34,600
They it's almost confirmed that the reason why it's almost it's an accusation now is because they have to unseal a document that was sealed recently that was talking about how Fannie's had a Willis had a relationship with that person.

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,600
Right, right.

307
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:47,500
In a 39 page filing seeking dismissal of charges an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman made accusations that Willis and Wade have traveled together destinations including Napa Valley and they've been seen together in Atlanta in a personal capacity.

308
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,600
And this is about the lover accusation.

309
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,100
Yeah.

310
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Well, yes.

311
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:59,000
This is the lead prosecutor that Fannie Willis has appointed who is also apparently her lover that she's having an affair with.

312
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,900
Like I'm more interested in the other thing though the meeting with the Biden Council or whatever.

313
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,400
Yeah, that's in the

314
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,100
Yeah, if you have that you can just look at that too.

315
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,200
I think I do.

316
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Hold on.

317
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,700
Yeah, because I sent it to you.

318
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,100
You should.

319
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,700
Yes.

320
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,100
Again, this is again, yeah, I'll send this to you as well.

321
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,900
Like this is again a Twitter headline.

322
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,300
So it's always good to look beyond Twitter headlines and actually look at some things a bit more deeply, but it's a good place to start a conversation.

323
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Yeah, Nathan Wade Fannie Willis is the lead prosecutor met with Biden's White House Council on May 23rd and November 18th 2022 before indicting Donald Trump.

324
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,100
Yeah, so this is not the special council that was in charge of actually investigating him for crimes.

325
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,700
This is the White House Council, which is Biden's representatives.

326
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,400
So he has no reason to even talk to them at all.

327
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,800
So so this seems like before Fannie Willis.

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,100
Yes, appointed Nathan Wade as part of the Georgia Rico case.

329
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,500
That's what's going on here, right before that even happened.

330
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,000
Correct.

331
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,500
He had already met with the White House Council, which is why personal the personal loyal lawyer to the president.

332
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,200
Yeah, why would he have any capacity be talking to them?

333
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,100
I don't know.

334
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,600
Well, I guess yes.

335
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,500
So the answer is he doesn't have any actual official reason to be talking.

336
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
So what do you what do you find?

337
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, one, the Fannie Willis is was coordinating to bring prosecution to Trump in Georgia.

338
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:37,700
She had a boyfriend who was not well known to to anybody in the public who she could send as a proxy to go talk to them.

339
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:46,900
And then she appointed him as the lead prosecutor in the case because one, it's your boyfriend to they they share the money that he makes from the prosecution.

340
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Who they've they've already stated that in the allegations.

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,200
So this is all true, but it's also conceivable that you would have people working on the Georgia Rico case also talking to the president's office.

342
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
That also makes sense.

343
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:09,000
This guy before this guy ever was appointed and he has no experience prosecuting hardly at all anybody.

344
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,900
OK, he had no reason.

345
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,200
Hold on.

346
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,500
Isn't isn't he an attorney?

347
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,600
He like before he's an attorney, right?

348
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,500
Yeah, but not all attorneys do prosecutions, man.

349
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,700
OK, let's see what he's doing or high or high level ones for that matter.

350
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,600
Let's look him up.

351
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
What's his work history?

352
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,400
Yep.

353
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,400
Yeah, I mean, like you have to have a first case at some point, right?

354
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,900
Like you have to have a hold on.

355
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,700
You don't you don't you don't you don't send a brand new person to prosecute the former president of the United States.

356
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,500
This is not going to happen.

357
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,300
Apparently did.

358
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,400
Yeah.

359
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,600
Who is Nathan Wade Fulton special special prosecutor?

360
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,500
Let's see what he's done.

361
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,100
He's a special prosecutor.

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,500
He works in private practice.

363
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,200
He's a defense attorney and a one time municipal court judge.

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,800
Suburban Atlanta firm.

365
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,500
Wade and Campbell focuses on personal injury cases, contract litigation, family and domestic law and criminal defense.

366
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,400
A graduate of John Marshall Law School.

367
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,700
He was an assistant.

368
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,700
He was an assistant solicitor for Cobb County in 1999.

369
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,500
Yeah, the office that handles misdemeanor cases.

370
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,800
He became Marietta's first black male judge in 20, not black, black and male, you know, black and male judge in 2011.

371
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
He was appointed to a post in the city's municipal court.

372
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,900
He he tried to run for higher judge offices because those are elected in this location and he did not win.

373
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,500
Yep.

374
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,000
You don't need any type of credentials to be elected to as a to a judge.

375
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
It's got it's a populated contest.

376
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah.

377
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,000
So that so being a judge.

378
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:49,300
He was in 2020, he was retained by Cobb Sheriff Neil Warren to review complaints of use of force, racial biases, discrimination, neglect at the county jail after seven detainees died in custody.

379
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,500
So basically, he is a lawyer and he's held like a bunch of small time positions.

380
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:05,300
So you can say that him him being raised to this high profile job by what seems to be his girlfriend is improper.

381
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,300
That makes sense.

382
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,000
Right.

383
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,500
But hold on, hold on.

384
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,400
But that being said, him meeting with the White House is not necessarily improper.

385
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,100
It is.

386
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,700
Why is he one?

387
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,800
You don't meet with the political opponent of a person you're going to indict.

388
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:34,300
That that's not something you want to do as a prosecutor if you're going to prosecute a case because then you are opening up the door for reversible error in terms of bias prosecutorial malice possible.

389
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:34,900
That's possible.

390
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,300
That's why you know, that's why you avoid it.

391
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,500
OK, you do it outright.

392
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,300
You avoid that.

393
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:55,500
You find somebody who's not connected to anybody and you select them as the lead prosecutor to avoid these things because this is a a the very minimal stepping stone for a fair trial because the defense is going to tear your part if they find it.

394
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
That that's what it sounds like.

395
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
It sounds like they'll get they'll get torn apart in court then, but what else is there?

396
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,900
What do you mean?

397
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,700
What do you mean?

398
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,900
We said you said one.

399
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,800
Is there any other reason why this is bad?

400
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:06,900
Yes.

401
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:29,900
So if the if the person is going to a before having even being anointed as a special prosecutor and they're going to a the White House counsel to talk to Biden's representative, that means that there was already an intent to put them in as the special prosecutor ahead of time.

402
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:38,700
So that this is pre-planning in coordination by the administration with Fannie Willis ahead of time to to put a problem with that.

403
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,200
Oh, yeah, you're not you're not an inexperienced prosecutor on the case.

404
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:54,000
They hatched the plot to meet with him before and do what coordinate coordinate prosecutions across multiple states.

405
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,700
I just why would I will I don't understand the motivation other than

406
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,900
I want this guy to be the prosecutor because I'm sleeping with them.

407
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,600
Why?

408
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay.

409
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,100
I don't understand why there has to be any deeper meeting than these people are.

410
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,200
Well, because you came in right?

411
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,800
Yeah, you came in and you say should these things stand when they've their corrupt processes of violate people's rights.

412
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:24,200
My answer that is no, but then I look at to okay, this is this is yeah, this is probably improper.

413
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,500
If what you're saying is correct, if what you're saying is correct, it's probably improper, but I don't I don't know if it.

414
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,500
Okay, so anything to the case, right?

415
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:43,400
So if you have some again, it goes back to a biased prosecutor prosecutorial.

416
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,600
We call malfeasance.

417
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,600
Okay charge.

418
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,700
I mean, maybe it's like I said, I'm not a legal scholar and I don't know much about the law.

419
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
I don't know much about the legal processes.

420
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
You could be absolutely correct here.

421
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,500
I just as a layman as someone just looking into these things.

422
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,100
It just doesn't it doesn't set off too many alarms other than yeah.

423
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,400
Okay.

424
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
They had their friend.

425
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
I understand that.

426
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,600
I understand that normal corruption in like Democratic areas is going to not set off alarms.

427
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,700
But when you already have hold on, hold on, hold on.

428
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,300
Let me finish.

429
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:12,600
Go ahead.

430
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:12,900
Go ahead.

431
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,100
Go ahead.

432
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:24,000
We have Fannie Willis nepotistically appointing an inexperienced and unqualified attorney to being a prosecutor for which he has no prosecutorial background.

433
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:46,000
As the lead prosecutor with unlimited power as a special prosecutor, okay against a former president of the United States when he had met with the president's political enemies before this you are now in so far into the get rid of this fucking guy and replace him with somebody better.

434
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,700
And at the very start that should have been the start thing but they went in have done all of this and then charged him and now I'm going to trial.

435
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:02,700
This is irreversible error because now you're showing that the system and the people in power are too biased to have followed proper conduct.

436
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:12,500
Well, then if our legal system is working and if what you're saying is correct, it's going to be a kind of an own goal on the prosecution side.

437
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,100
It is and this is the issue is that yeah, but like I said, I don't I don't know.

438
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,100
I think that's evidence that the system is working and I don't know.

439
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,600
I don't know.

440
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,300
Does that make sense?

441
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,900
At least that like, okay, they did something really stupid and they're going to be punished in court for it.

442
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:38,900
So this is the like at this is the this is the same Fulton County that has been stonewalling a ballot case for three years now.

443
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,300
Don't just bring up another fucking thing man.

444
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,800
Like come on but but this is true and you can't argue.

445
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,100
Okay.

446
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,600
Sure.

447
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,000
It's true, but it's unrelated.

448
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,800
Okay.

449
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,500
I'm just saying this is right here.

450
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,100
I have a question to ask you at the start of this.

451
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,300
Okay, I do have a question.

452
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,300
So what you've what you've brought here seems to be two separate things.

453
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,400
Okay, go ahead.

454
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:04,500
And the first one is Fannie Willis appoints her boyfriend who and she is a public figure.

455
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,600
He is not she is kind of well known.

456
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:16,300
He really isn't that well known his career what he's done in his career does not seem to warrant him be him being given this this huge position.

457
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,800
And so it seems like it's an it she has improperly appointed him.

458
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,000
That seems to be true from what we have.

459
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,400
All right.

460
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,800
All right.

461
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:33,000
However, the the second part of the second thing that you have here is why did this guy meet with the White House legal team, right?

462
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,800
Those are two those are two separate questions.

463
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:51,100
So for example, if it turns out that he actually has completely good reasons for meeting with the White House legal team like what hold on if that were the case then the first the first problem which is he got appointed nepotistically.

464
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
That isn't enough and shouldn't be enough to throw the entire case out, right?

465
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,000
Mm hmm.

466
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Maybe no, no, hold on.

467
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:09,500
It would throw him and Fannie Willis off the case and probably be put under a different County da to coordinate and redo the entire thing because you're true because that's probably true.

468
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:20,600
Yes, everything everything in its case at the moment would be under suspect and judges would be really really hesitant to touch it unless they like it's been gone through with a fine to come.

469
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,700
Yeah, I don't you mean like they might say okay, like you two are clearly corrupt and you're scratching each other's backs.

470
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,900
We're going to get different prosecutors and like you guys are gone.

471
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,400
So that might be the case.

472
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Yes, but in terms of disqualifying the whole thing solely because she brought her her boyfriend on board.

473
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I don't see that being legitimate frankly.

474
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:50,300
Now the real question this is why I think with you were on that you're on the money is that the real question is why did he meet with the White House because I do think that there are actually good reasons as to why a person in his

475
00:30:50,300 --> 00:31:02,200
position might do so well if you are prosecuting Trump and there might be legitimate information to let me finish it.

476
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,400
I let you finish things there might be legitimate information to come out of Biden himself or from other people working at the White House or from the White House office.

477
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:17,300
It seems reasonable that the prosecutor would go to people involved which includes people at the White House and ask them about it.

478
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah, so though that's that's kind of post hoc because this was he was he went there beforehand.

479
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,400
Sure.

480
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,800
He was even as a prosecutor.

481
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,900
But you're alleging that there can be no other reason than malfeasance for this to happen.

482
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:37,700
That is what you were you were kind of implying with your statements that the only reason that they could have a meeting is for corruption.

483
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,800
And if there are other reasons where it would be legitimate like Dev said yes, it's post hoc.

484
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:50,900
But the fact is we were how we're all having to like post hoc this because none of us have the information of what they were actually meeting about.

485
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm not privy to those are at information.

486
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,600
Are you?

487
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,500
No, that's just what you avoid doing.

488
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,700
He's speculating.

489
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
We're all speculating.

490
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:08,600
We're all making guesses about what may or may not have and our biases obviously will make us lean one way or the other now again.

491
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:15,300
What should happen is they should be forthwith and like tell people right?

492
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,800
I'm all for more transparency and all these processes, right?

493
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,600
And so unless it violates some kind of national security risk, which it might or anything.

494
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,000
I think it's perfectly fine to release the logs of the meetings and things like that.

495
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:38,300
So so when a person is anointed through nepotistic and corrupt methods, it is not up to the people launching an issue with it to have to then prove that his

496
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,500
meeting with somebody he was he's not supposed to meet with would ever be anything other than proper.

497
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:54,800
Okay, it is up to the person that was corruptly anointed to show that their meeting was above board, which can be done through minutes or communication.

498
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,400
I guess we'll see if it is or not.

499
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,300
That's not that's not up to the people having an issue with a clearly ethics violation.

500
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,100
His issue to reveal that to isn't to you.

501
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,000
It's to the no, no, no, it is it.

502
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
No, it's to everybody.

503
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,600
That would be why, why, why, why, why, why, what, what obligation does he have to tell you shit, right?

504
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,900
Like you want to know, well, you're on the jury.

505
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,200
You're not in the county.

506
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,400
I don't believe right.

507
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,200
Is he he was selected as a public official.

508
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,800
So he is now when he is as a running as working as a public official.

509
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:37,900
He is now held to the standard of public officials, which is recording those things and then keeping that sure and releasing it to the people who need

510
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:45,200
to know, right, which in this case would be the court system, the judges involved in the case and the public.

511
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,800
It was because those things are publicly filed.

512
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,200
Yes.

513
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,700
So hold on, hold on, hold on.

514
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,000
This also seems kind of post hoc, though, Artemis.

515
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,300
Why?

516
00:33:53,100 --> 00:34:01,200
So what as as you said earlier, when he he talked to he went to the White House in May and then again in November, right?

517
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,700
He hadn't been appointed.

518
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,100
He hadn't been appointed this in this public council position yet, right?

519
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,600
Yes, which is the issue, right?

520
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:25,100
So it could be the case that they knew they were going to appoint him and the and she sent him along to do some sort of secret talks, hoping that it wouldn't come up and said, you know, I'm going to point you in a few months.

521
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,700
You go do this right now and that, you know, even as described, that could be OK, depending.

522
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm not sure.

523
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,700
However, sure, it's not OK.

524
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,800
We have secret talks when you're when you're working as a in your official capacity as a prosecutor.

525
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,700
He wasn't.

526
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,100
No, no, no, he wasn't working.

527
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,600
No, no, no, no.

528
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,500
That's the point.

529
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
And he wasn't working.

530
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,400
He wasn't working in a capacity.

531
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:45,900
Hold on.

532
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,800
Fanny was can't.

533
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,400
Fanny Willis can't send him to do that in a secret way.

534
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,300
That's that.

535
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,200
But it would be her problem, not his.

536
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,800
It would be her problem.

537
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,200
Not his.

538
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, but it's but it's OK, but it still comes back to affecting the case because she said to me clandestinely to go talk to the political.

539
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,300
The enemy political enemy of the person getting prosecuted.

540
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,100
Well, all I'm hearing from this is I got to find someone that I can sleep with.

541
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,800
That'll suit me to the moon.

542
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
That will get me into the big leagues.

543
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,100
Who do I got to sleep with?

544
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Is that how it is?

545
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,300
Apparently, apparently, according to so here's the thing, right?

546
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:28,300
Like because he did this before actually working in an official capacity, it could be have been for anything.

547
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,800
And that's really the point here, right?

548
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,700
Which is why you avoid ever having brought him into the prosecutorial position in the first place.

549
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:45,000
Well, I think actually that brings up a problem because now you're saying I can't bring in any lawyer who has ever talked to the president because someone might dig through it and discover that.

550
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
Sure, that's you have an infinite amount of lawyers.

551
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,100
You can pull through across the country for being an infinite amount of lawyers.

552
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,900
I mean, here, here, how about he had other reasons to go to like work-related reasons to go to the White House.

553
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,500
Okay, so hypothetically, let's say he has work-related reasons to go to the White House for some other case or some other instance or something else going on, right?

554
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,100
And so he has those two meetings and then he gets hired nepotistically by his girlfriend, right?

555
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:22,800
Now that makes it that makes not his meetings the problem, but the nepotistic hiring the problem, right?

556
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:30,200
All right, I'm going to make this a really easy one for you to understand and there was a wrap this up after this because we do have more people in line.

557
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,600
Do you remember a infamous tarmac meeting?

558
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,800
Which one the Loretta Lynch Clinton meeting was that?

559
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,800
No, I don't you got to remind me of this where they decided that I'm pretty sure it hold on.

560
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Let me let me bring it up that way.

561
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:00,500
I guess what I'm saying, I guess what I'm saying basically Artemis is that everything that you're saying is possible.

562
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,100
It is more likely than but we do not have enough evidence for it yet.

563
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
And now I want to see more evidence for it, but it is possible.

564
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:22,400
Yes, so I'll send you the the Loretta Lynch Clinton story about the meeting on the tarmac without for no reason apparently, but that, you know, people can claim is above board and that nothing happened.

565
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:33,300
But the the the resulting actions after that meeting led to a reversing in the expected outcomes of cases.

566
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:41,200
So also the the person broke the story ended up dead, but that's that's a different reason.

567
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:49,500
There's all these implications and everything you're saying is like, oh, and also they ended up dead.

568
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:56,600
I wonder why I mean that I know why, but isn't it weird that he ended up dead?

569
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,800
Isn't it weird?

570
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:11,600
But there is the issue is that the there's the tarmac meeting is a really good example of where people would have to recuse themselves regardless of what was talked about on that plane on the tarmac.

571
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:23,200
The you cannot have somebody in any fashion overseeing a case when the person that the case is involved is the person you like representative you talk to on a plane where no one else could hear it.

572
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, tell you what, Artemis, thank you for bringing this to my attention.

573
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,900
I'll check it out because again, I don't want to take your word for it.

574
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,700
I wouldn't take Dev's word for it or anyone's on the Internet's word for it.

575
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:43,100
I'll look into some some more check out some articles, see what they got and see if I can't find if there's any more information out there.

576
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,400
But I do appreciate you calling in, buddy.

577
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,200
Thanks for coming by.

578
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,000
And for now, though.

579
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,800
I'll send you away, send you to the void, as I say, I think you get a chance to reply to that last thing.

580
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,500
Well, what did you want to say?

581
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:05,100
I guess the TLDR is that the things that Artemis present sometimes are just crazy.

582
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,700
There's other conversations we've had where he's just I think he's just been wrong.

583
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,100
But like this, this is possible, but there's not enough evidence.

584
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,600
We have to wait.

585
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,900
That's all you're going to lose your right wing cred, buddy.

586
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,900
Like people tell people tell me that you're this crypto tanky guy.

587
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,200
Thank you.

588
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,600
Right.

589
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:23,900
All right.

590
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,700
Maybe a crypto communist.

591
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,500
Well, thank you.

592
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Your communist is anyone who goes for Biden and certain people.

593
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,200
OK, right.

594
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:36,200
So, you know, like so not believing the conspiracy theory right off the bat.

595
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,100
What are you doing?

596
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,000
What's going on?

597
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,000
But gang?

598
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,500
Yeah.

599
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,700
If you want to call in, if you'd like to talk to us about something, it could be political.

600
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
It could be cultural, could be anything you'd like.

601
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,700
Hit the Discord link.

602
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,200
I'll put it in chats.

603
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,900
Escalation board, Discord and the Twitch chat.

604
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,900
Click the link, accept the rules, jump backstage, we'll pull you on.

605
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Let's get to our next caller.

606
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,600
Whoa, they were here.

607
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,800
They were here just a minute ago.

608
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,200
There was people here, but then they vanished.

609
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,900
Because they got they got impatient.

610
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,500
And this is what happens, right?

611
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,200
They get in, they want to call and then they're like, oh, man, this is taking too long.

612
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,000
And then they'll just dip.

613
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,700
Oh, there we go.

614
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,300
Here we go.

615
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Allison, hello.

616
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,600
You're live.

617
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,400
Can you hear me?

618
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,000
I can hear you.

619
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,300
Hi.

620
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,800
Hi.

621
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I don't have the camera today, if that's okay.

622
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,200
That's, no one has the camera in, except for me in this place.

623
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,700
So go ahead.

624
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Okay, well, okay, I listen to NPR Up First every morning, and I listen to the Daily Wire's shameless ripoff of NPR Up First every morning.

625
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Okay, so I get the little like mainstream right and left daily news perspectives and like, I'm subscribed to the times.

626
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,000
And I'm just like seeing constant reports about immigration all of a sudden.

627
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
I know it's always a big issue.

628
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:12,600
But I swear the last like five weeks, I just see article after article about like, Democrat mayor is pissed off about immigration, like New York suing bus companies that complied with Abbott's orders, like Biden suing to cut the razor wire in Texas.

629
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,300
He previously sued to get the floating barriers.

630
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:24,000
But it's like one after, I don't know if I'm just like maybe on alert for it because these fucking commenters keep telling me it's really going to affect the election in 2024.

631
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,500
This is going to be a big fucking deal.

632
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,400
I don't know if the priming has worked or whatever, but I just like keep noticing it.

633
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,900
Is this like a real thing or what's going on?

634
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:40,600
I mean, immigration has been a hot button issue since Build the Wall in 2016, right?

635
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,100
Like, or even before then.

636
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,000
So I don't, yeah, it absolutely is something that is a political football that's going to be tossed around.

637
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,700
There's people going to have big hyperbolic takes on it.

638
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,200
And there's more and more lawsuits, like more and more legal action.

639
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,800
I don't think it's just people talking like I think like shit is happening in courts more and more.

640
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,500
What do you mean?

641
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:12,800
Like, okay, so New York did just sue all those bus companies that complied with Abbott's busing efforts to sanctuary cities.

642
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:19,000
So the implication there is that they're trying to like stop private companies from like complying with the Texas governor's order.

643
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:29,200
In the past, Biden successfully, or his administration successfully sued to get the floating barriers in the Rio Grande removed, calling them an environmental hazard.

644
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,900
He's currently suing to cut the razor wire border on Texas.

645
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:51,700
And then also Texas recently criminalized crossing the border illegally on the state level, which would give Texas state cops the ability to like detain suspected illegal border crossers and like deport them or like refer them to ICE for deportation.

646
00:42:52,300 --> 00:43:02,300
And so Biden's like, it's like, specifically, there's more and more legal fights between Greg Abbott and Biden's administration or related parties like the state of New York.

647
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,700
But it's just interesting to me.

648
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,100
It's like an interesting little I don't know.

649
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:16,900
You know, I don't understand why Americans are weird about their borders, like most other countries are like, oh, yeah, you can't come through.

650
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,700
That's just how it is.

651
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,400
How come there's so much for a second?

652
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,700
Can you repeat that last thing?

653
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,700
Okay, sure, sure.

654
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:35,100
I don't understand why Americans are weird about their borders because in every other country, it's like, yeah, you can't come into the country without going through a proper border crossing and you can't just can't just jump the border.

655
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,200
That's normal everywhere else.

656
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:44,600
Why is it that when it comes to the American Mexican border, you have people screaming that it's somehow racist to build a wall?

657
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
It's like, what the fuck?

658
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,900
Like other countries have walls is no big deal.

659
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,500
Like what's what's going on here?

660
00:43:51,800 --> 00:44:03,300
I mean, I mean, also another steel man, the other side, they'd be like, well, we don't want that even though it's normal in other countries, like it's normal in other countries to pressure a population, right?

661
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,300
Do we want that?

662
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,400
Obviously not.

663
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,600
We could look at the EU, right?

664
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:20,700
In other multinational conglomerates, if you will, that have treaties that allow free movement between countries without any of these border restrictions and things like that.

665
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:27,100
So while yes, in many countries, it is normalized to have a straight, strict border security.

666
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,300
That's not the case everywhere.

667
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,800
Yeah, but I mean, Americans don't have that kind of news.

668
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Oh, sorry, the Republicans have tied Israel and Ukraine aid to like a certain number of what they would say is common sense immigration reform.

669
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,300
Other people would say really conservative, harsh, harsh on people who are just trying to make it for themselves and their children.

670
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,500
So it like depends.

671
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,100
But that's another thing that's happening right now.

672
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,400
Well, I mean, if you wanted to start cutting deals, that's how you would do it, right?

673
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,100
It's like the conservatives want something, the liberals want something else.

674
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,800
You make a deal.

675
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,700
You reduce immigration, you get more aid.

676
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,200
I mean, it seems like it's a fair trade.

677
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:16,600
I feel like the Democrats, I mean, again, maybe I'm like buying the hype because all these like commentariat people keep implying that like the Democrats will probably be electorally punished for this.

678
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,700
Like this doesn't seem to be very popular.

679
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:25,500
Apparently, immigration is the issue that Biden consistently polls lowest in terms of confidence for voters.

680
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,000
We did have it.

681
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,100
It's like, are you sure about that?

682
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,200
Because I'm pretty sure it would be Israel-Palestine at this point.

683
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,700
Oh, I don't think it's like the top one, but it's amongst the top like three, I think, immigration is.

684
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,100
Well, but I don't know that it's like number one, least confident.

685
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:48,600
To that point, there was a recent poll out where I guess Biden's approval rating is only at 38%.

686
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,000
It's very, very low.

687
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,600
And it is an issue, right?

688
00:45:52,900 --> 00:46:03,400
I think Biden's low approval numbers are going to have an impact going forward, but I don't think it's caused to panic as of yet.

689
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:11,000
I think this might change going into the general as one, the economy gets better and continues to improve, right?

690
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,100
There's a lot of really good signs that the economy is trending upward right now.

691
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,400
But yeah, we'll have to see.

692
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,900
There's some signs that might be trending downward, though.

693
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I mean, I've heard that layoffs are coming in the next six months, like big layoffs are coming.

694
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,500
Oh, so they might come in the future.

695
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Maybe, but like I believe it was the Wall Street Journal.

696
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:44,400
I could be wrong on who reported this, but in December wage increase surpassed inflation increase, right?

697
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,400
And that's been something that's been underwater since COVID for a long time.

698
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,900
And it's now kind of finally kind of surpassed that.

699
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,300
So it's not entirely fixed yet.

700
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,900
There are still some big problems.

701
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,900
But again, trends that I'm seeing are all pointing to things are going to get better.

702
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,400
Now, will that actually affect his poll numbers?

703
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,800
We'll see, right?

704
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:15,200
And when it comes to immigration to your topic, Alison, I don't know.

705
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,700
Like, I don't know if that's going to be the big issue of 2024.

706
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,200
I really don't, but I could be wrong.

707
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,300
We shall see.

708
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,000
We shall see.

709
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,500
Is there anything else you have for us today?

710
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,400
No, that's really it.

711
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,400
I see you have the line again, so I'll let you go.

712
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,700
Okay, Alison, thank you for calling in.

713
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,800
And I will talk to you.

714
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,300
Bye.

715
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,400
Bye.

716
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,900
Yeah, so what other signs, just before bringing the next caller, I'm just curious.

717
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,800
Other than the layouts, what other signs do you see that the economy is getting worse?

718
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,500
That was the main one.

719
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,200
That was it.

720
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:52,500
Fair enough.

721
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,500
It might be true, right?

722
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,600
Like, we can only guess at the future.

723
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,400
We'll have to see.

724
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,300
Five dollars from Artemis Fowl says, Wick, tell people about the Muslim Uber driver I told you about.

725
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:04,800
I will.

726
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,900
We're going to let some callers get in and get stories in too, though, right?

727
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,600
This is a community event.

728
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,800
Okay, but I'll tell that story if the line dies down.

729
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,900
Let me bring in the next caller.

730
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,600
Hello, you're live.

731
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,600
Hello.

732
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,700
Hello, so I have a stupid question and then I have a serious question.

733
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,400
The stupid question is, what do you like better, Pokemon or Digimon?

734
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:30,900
Hello.

735
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,000
Hi.

736
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:38,900
Hi, so I'm not that familiar with Digimon, so if I had to choose between the two, I'll go with Pokemon because it's more familiar.

737
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,500
That's me.

738
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,700
Hold on a second.

739
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,100
Hold on.

740
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,600
Hold on a second.

741
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,800
I'm having a problem here.

742
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,500
Give me a second.

743
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,000
Okay, no.

744
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,600
Hi, Sparkles.

745
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,300
What's going on?

746
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:50,700
Hi.

747
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,900
Well, okay.

748
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,200
So I've been seeing this word neoliberal a lot.

749
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,800
What does it mean?

750
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,500
That's who's saying it.

751
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,500
Neoliberal is usually thrown around as an insult.

752
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,400
I don't know the precise definition.

753
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,700
Let's Wikipedia it.

754
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,600
Okay, so neoliberalism is a term used to signify.

755
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:25,300
The late 20th century political reappearance of 19th century ideas associated with free market capitalism, which had fallen into decline following the Second World War.

756
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,400
Let's see.

757
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,000
All I know is that if someone calls me a neoliberal, they're not wishing me.

758
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,500
Well, okay, they're not one by you piece of shit.

759
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,200
Neoliberal shit.

760
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,100
One impetus for the formulation of policies to mitigate capitalist free market volatility was a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the 1930s.

761
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:08,400
And policymaking neoliberalism often refers to what what often refers to what was part of a paradigm shift that followed the perceived failure of the post-war consensus and Keynesian economics to address the stagflation of the 1970s.

762
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,000
Okay.

763
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,800
Yeah, so so basically.

764
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:17,300
From what I basically understand is after the end of the Second World War up until pretty much the 1970s.

765
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:25,400
You had a lot of a lot of like Social Democrats are the ones who were paving the way in the various mainstream left-wing parties in the world.

766
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,000
Lots of high taxation and lots of lots of lots of social spending, right?

767
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,700
But you did that for about 30 or 40 years and the economy eventually stagnated.

768
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,900
So you so with the neoliberals basically came in with them with Ronald Reagan and Reagan's idea was hold on, hold on, hold on.

769
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,300
How about and we don't necessarily need to get rid of all the social spending.

770
00:50:47,300 --> 00:51:01,600
But how about we cut some of this regulation to allow people to be able to more easily work and companies to be built and there's more economic growth and there's more prosperity and that basically worked and was the political paradigm of the West.

771
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,700
I think until Trump.

772
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,300
They get lasted from Reagan to Trump neoliberals.

773
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,900
They called Nikki Haley and neoliberal.

774
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:19,900
Yeah, so so the the left will often use neoliberal as an insult towards people who maybe they have some.

775
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:27,200
Some more progressive social views like on gay marriage or something like that, but ultimately they're very pro-capitalist.

776
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,700
They're not socialists at all.

777
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:45,300
So they use neoliberal as an insult and they did what they basically mean is like, you know, fake revolutionary or you know, like a capital like rainbow capitalism is also kind of related to this idea where it's like somebody who's very inclusive socially, but still ultimately a capitalist.

778
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,600
It's like a socialist slur basically.

779
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,300
It was a conservative guy that said it.

780
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Okay, so when conservatives use the word neoliberal as an insult, it's also not good.

781
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:08,200
So when conservatives do it, they're basically saying like neoliberals are trying to appeal to the economics of the right, but they tax too high and they're too progressive for our tastes.

782
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,400
Okay, okay, that makes sense now.

783
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,900
Okay, thank you.

784
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,800
Yeah, it's used as an insult by both sides.

785
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
Cuz at first I was like, I don't yeah.

786
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,200
Okay.

787
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:28,500
Cuz he I cuz he would say that she wanted to be the vice president be if Trump she they want Trump to have her as a would be his vice president.

788
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,400
I think she said she would do that if she was asked.

789
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,800
Yeah.

790
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah.

791
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,200
Yeah.

792
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,400
Yeah.

793
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,800
She said yeah, but he said no.

794
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,400
He said no.

795
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,100
He doesn't want her.

796
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:35,800
Yeah, not at all.

797
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,100
Yeah.

798
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,400
No, there's there's there's no fucking way that he would.

799
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,700
Yeah.

800
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,400
How do you Dev?

801
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,600
How do you respond to the accusations that you're a neoliberal?

802
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,400
I might be I mean, it sounds like here's the thing.

803
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,500
If you look at you know, the the Golden Age of the neoliberals things are pretty good.

804
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,300
Yeah, the nifty 90s.

805
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,200
It was a good time.

806
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,400
Can't complain.

807
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You know, if it turned out that I was just a neoliberal in the end after everything was boiled down.

808
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,100
I'd be fine with that.

809
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
I don't hate neoliberals.

810
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,000
I think liberals hold on a bad rap in general, right?

811
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,100
I think that more and more cry.

812
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,200
I don't buck against the label.

813
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,700
If you want to call me a liberal kind of okay.

814
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,300
I'm definitely I'm definitely a liberal.

815
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:18,700
Yes.

816
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,300
Also the men it sparkles.

817
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,000
I think sparkles.

818
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,400
You've been watching me for years now.

819
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,200
It's the first time we've spoken sparkles.

820
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,800
I think it is.

821
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,500
It is I've been saying voice messages before but we've never talked about.

822
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,200
Oh, no, right, right.

823
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,800
Is this a first time?

824
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,400
No, you okay.

825
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,900
It's not a stalker situation.

826
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,600
Is it or no?

827
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,100
No, it's fine.

828
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,300
It's fine.

829
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,000
It's okay.

830
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,500
No, you've been watching me for years and years.

831
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:48,500
So what I what I recall is there's been and you've certainly seen this sparkles.

832
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:57,500
There's been so many people who get mad at me when they finally realize that I actually am a liberal and I haven't been dog-whistling this whole time.

833
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:06,600
And it happens pretty regularly where it's like we you're actually a liberal and you're not you know, someone who says they're a liberal but you're actually far left or far right.

834
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,500
It's like no, I'm not no, I'm actually a liberal.

835
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,700
All the time I don't understand the commie you get called that all the time.

836
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,500
Yeah.

837
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:14,700
Yeah.

838
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:32,500
Yeah, people who are more who are way more right-leaning than me call me communist all the time and what they mean by communist is basically somebody who is in any way even just slightly progressive socially or believes in some level of taxation that isn't zero.

839
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,100
That's what they mean by communist.

840
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:41,700
And then and then you have like you have people on Twitter or you have like BreadTubers or something.

841
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:50,700
I've heard Vashj say this about me a handful of times that like I'm a fascist right or I'm alt-right or I'm some sort of not like neo-nazi or right way something right something.

842
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,700
Yeah, crypto fascist.

843
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
I thought he just called you a fatchus.

844
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,700
A fat, what did he say?

845
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,200
A fatchus.

846
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,200
Yeah, a fatchus.

847
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Is that me?

848
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,200
He's annoying anyway.

849
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,200
Vashj.

850
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:04,700
Yeah.

851
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,700
I mean, I've heard that maybe he's he's like slightly maybe one drop de-radicalizing.

852
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,500
I don't believe it though.

853
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,200
But I mean, he's he's slowly he's slowly coming out of the Fortress Ark.

854
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:35,000
I've had a I've had him on my stream once before generally look, he's a nice enough gentleman when you interact with him one-to-one I have substantive disagreements with I think some of the ways he handles himself but in a lot of other ways.

855
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:57,800
I actually agree with him and in some ways right like I think that there is something to the to be said about critiques of capitalism and critiques of more fascistic or more right-leaning institutions and groups and things like that, but you just can't the my problem my biggest problem with him is he can't believe anything.

856
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,000
He says you have to research it on your own because he'll just go with things.

857
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:16,700
The funniest clip I saw was him reviewing the terrorist attack in Iran where they blew up a bunch of people attending this Memorial for so many.

858
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,700
I believe it was and he's watching this and he's the whole time.

859
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,600
He's blaming Israel like oh Israel.

860
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,800
This has to be a girl.

861
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:31,900
I'm like calling it and it's Israel Israel did this Israel did this it definitely is and then like a week later Isis takes responsibility for the attacks.

862
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,600
And so you can't really trust him, but he's fine.

863
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,100
I know what you mean.

864
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:43,600
What about Tacoma and I live by Tacoma and Tacoma has lead in the water and lead in the water can make it more aggressive.

865
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,000
So maybe that's part of his issue.

866
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,700
You think so?

867
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I think he's rich enough.

868
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,500
He doesn't drink the poor's water right?

869
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,900
He probably gets some bottles.

870
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,000
Bye I could be wrong, but thank you for calling in Miss Sparkles.

871
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,200
Is there anything else you have for us?

872
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,500
Digimon is better than Pokemon.

873
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:58,900
That's it.

874
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,100
Bye.

875
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,800
Why?

876
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,800
Why though?

877
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,900
Why is it better?

878
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,500
I'm not sure it is.

879
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,600
Did you mind like they're basically the same thing, right?

880
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,100
You you catch the animal you raise them and you train them to battle other animals.

881
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,500
No, did you Mon like like each human like there's like special humans who are given one.

882
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:30,200
And it's like it's like like their permanent partner and they only have one and they go on these adventures where they temporarily evolve them, but they devolve after the battle.

883
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,000
It's different.

884
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,600
But it was definitely like it was definitely made in the wake of the Pokemon craze in the 90s.

885
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,900
Fair enough, fair enough.

886
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,800
Look, I I missed that.

887
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,300
I never grew up with that.

888
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,300
I played a few Pokemon games and it's fun for what it is.

889
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,100
It's just not something that really like captured me.

890
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,900
Let's bring on the the next guest.

891
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,700
I'm not sure which one of y'all joined first.

892
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,300
So I'm just gonna I'm just gonna guess and we'll find out.

893
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,200
Hello, you're live.

894
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh, he's gone.

895
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,500
He went back.

896
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,300
Try again.

897
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,000
We'll try it again.

898
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,900
Sorry, sorry.

899
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,600
Hello, can you hear me?

900
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,100
Vaguely, you're very low.

901
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,200
Can you turn yourself up?

902
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,400
By the way, thank you for the subs and Twitch.

903
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
Thank you for the prime subs.

904
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,100
Oh birds.

905
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,900
Thank you for the gift subs and all that.

906
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,100
I really appreciate that.

907
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,000

Hi, give me money.

Give what needs the money now.

911
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,300
Give it to him.

912
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,000
Okay, so you'll be a vtuber wick.

913
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,900
You'll make money that way.

914
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,900
What are you trying to say?

915
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:44,500
Please?

916
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,900
No, I don't know if you guys have talked about this but this

917
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,600
is something I got into a bit of a discussion conversation

918
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,400
with a friend of mine coming back did a long drive from

919
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,000
Gen Con when the first Trump and diamonds really were coming

920
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,700
down and something okay first premise first kind of given

921
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:14,500
I guess is would Trump fans revolt would Trump cultists

922
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:20,800
or whatever fans people who want to vote for Trump if he's

923
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,700
indicted on every charge.

924
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,200
Well, look what they did in January 6 after he didn't win

925
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,100
the election, right?

926
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,400
That's that's what I'm saying.

927
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,500
So there would be a lot of to be clear like like en masse

928
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:36,100
nothing en masse what they do is nothing but there would be

929
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:41,200
let's say very small minority of very hyper partisan people

930
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,500
that would do some terrible shit.

931
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:43,800
Now.

932
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,300
This isn't unique to Trump right and a lot of people will

933
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:52,000
say it is but it's not I read a story recently.

934
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,500
That has made me kind of wonder if the reason we don't see

935
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:03,200
as much left-wing violence is because left-wing hard left-wingers

936
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,400
are just retarded.

937
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,800
There is a man in 2020.

938
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,900
I believe who the only reason the mayor of this the Jewish

939
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,100
mayor of this town is still alive is because this guy was

940
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,600
so incompetent in his assassination attempts.

941
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,000
He failed twice like he went there to kill him, but he loaded

942
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,500
the bullet backwards and the gun advocating for more gun

943
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,000
training for leftist is what I'm here.

944
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,800
I don't I don't know but it was just it was wild.

945
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,000
So it's embarrassing.

946
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,400
Yeah.

947
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,400
So here's the thing.

948
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,200
I've been thinking of it.

949
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,900
So everyone always says that right wingers are more violent

950
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,000
than left-wingers and you ask him.

951
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,400
Why do you say that?

952
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,700
I wouldn't agree with that statement.

953
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,100
Yeah, I know I know but like when when when asked if they

954
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,300
give you the proper answer the proper answer is that there's

955
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,900
some sort of database that is divided up different types

956
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,800
of violence, right?

957
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,400
And I think it divides it.

958
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,400
There's like hmm.

959
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,100
Was it left-wing right-wing and libertarian?

960
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,600
It might be that's what it might be.

961
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,500
But anyway, and like the overwhelming amount of of violence

962
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,400
is committed by right wingers.

963
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,300
I'm like, well, this is very interesting.

964
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,000
So I never never and it's like three years ago.

965
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,800
I never I never got around to doing it, but I should eventually

966
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,200
take some time and do it but I decided to like click on some

967
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,500
random instances of what they called in their database

968
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,600
of right-wing violence and a few of them were was legitimate

969
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,900
right-wing violence like violence for a political purpose.

970
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,000
But one of them was like there was a neo-nazi.

971
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,500
He was like a skinhead and he had like like swastikas tattooed

972
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,700
all over his body, right?

973
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:39,000
And he killed his mother and went to jail and that person

974
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,900
was flagged as right-wing violence.

975
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,600
I'm like, well, hold on.

976
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,300
I mean, he he seemed to kill his mother.

977
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:49,800
No, but like he seemed to kill his mother because his mother

978
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,200
was abusive, right?

979
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,900
And then the end of the situation is like, well, Is that

980
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,100
right-wing violence because a right-winger did it even though

981
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,800
there's no political motivation for the violence.

982
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,500
It was personal.

983
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,600
That doesn't seem to be that doesn't seem to be properly

984
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,100
filed. So at some point I was like, I'm going to sit down

985
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,700
with this 10,000 strong entry list and go through them that

986
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,600
I forgot to do it.

987
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,400
And I was like three years ago.

988
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:23,800
I forgot to do it and then like I keep thinking about it

989
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,600
like once every three months like I should do that and I

990
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,000
just I just don't well, it's something you keep hearing

991
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,800
right? You keep hearing that all right wingers commit more

992
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,600
violence in the West, right?

993
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,800
You hear that all the time and again, it might be true as

994
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,000
far as I know but but what I'm scared of, you know for this

995
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,400
premise really is to look back at January 6 and I'm scared

996
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,200
of people like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz the button, you know,

997
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,800
the banality of evil how simple it was for them to just keep

998
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,900
saying well we object on behalf of you know, whatever other

999
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,700
state, you know, we want them to recertify their election

1000
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,500
call new slates that that's what I'm scared of.

1001
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,600
I what I don't like to see is when you have groups of people

1002
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:15,600
that are in power who are scared of their own base by the

1003
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,400
leader Trump scared into a position where they have to now

1004
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,500
go. Okay.

1005
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,500
Are we actively supporting this coup?

1006
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,700
Can we tepidly support this coup?

1007
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:30,200
Can we you know, you know back it up and just use our political

1008
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,700
rhetoric speech where we say we fight like hell and we do,

1009
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,800
you know, because we have so many sick fans that will defend

1010
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,600
this online.

1011
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,600
And even when all the facts and truth and how hours and hours

1012
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,900
and videos out there.

1013
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,700
It's easy to just have someone like Alex Jones say they were

1014
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,000
led into the Capitol.

1015
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,700
I was there, you know, and and at the same time and Tifa did

1016
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:58,100
it so that so my whole the premise of the question was let's

1017
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:04,800
say there's a legitimate threat from conservatives that let's

1018
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:10,100
say Ted Cruz Jim Jordan many other conservative Republican

1019
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,500
lawmakers. Okay, I'm not saying the Alex Jones people I'm

1020
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:20,100
talking about lawmakers who say if Trump, you know, you know

1021
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:26,100
gets charged now he's charged now he's going to go to prison

1022
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:33,500
if he is actually going to be not acquitted and we're going

1023
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,300
to put him into prison because of that, you know, that's

1024
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,900
the ramifications of the things he's done.

1025
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,900
We will, you know, try to succeed from the Union or fuck

1026
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,000
them are like I don't care if it's a credible threat.

1027
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,900
They alike.

1028
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:52,600
Look if it goes through the courts the courts make the decision

1029
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,600
and find that there is wrongdoing and he is something beyond

1030
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,200
a reasonable doubt guilty of these things and it carries

1031
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,600
a sentence that includes jail time and he's sentenced to

1032
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,900
jail time and then people are going to revolt because they

1033
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:12,200
think that he should be above the law not fuck that.

1034
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,000
No, I don't care.

1035
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,800
Like if you we have to at least put the law above being fearful

1036
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,300
of how people will respond to law.

1037
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,400
That's my instinct on this.

1038
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,400
I understand what you're saying my whole premise to relied

1039
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,500
on the fact that Biden to try to keep the country United

1040
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:37,800
would announce before the election that he would acquit,

1041
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,900
you know, he would pardon Trump because I think about Nixon.

1042
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,500
I think about when's the last time something like this has

1043
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,500
ever happened in United States history and it was with Nixon

1044
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,300
Nixon did the you know, he tried to tamper with the election.

1045
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,400
He you know got information from his political opponents

1046
01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:01,300
and lied constantly constantly until he was finally backed

1047
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:07,000
up into a wall where he had to completely give up power and

1048
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,900
I firmly believe that if Nick Nixon did what he did today,

1049
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,500
he would only could get away with it just because the internet

1050
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,800
and the way the internet works.

1051
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,400
There's no way that he would not fight it more than someone

1052
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,500
like Trump and especially have the character of someone like

1053
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,300
Trump and what did we do to Nixon, you know, we completely

1054
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,400
pardoned him Ford pardoned him.

1055
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,200
That was the first thing he did when he got into power when

1056
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,900
he became president to forgive the country right to you know,

1057
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,700
like I said, I don't know if that will I don't know if that'll

1058
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,900
that'll heal what divides us.

1059
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:49,400
What do you think Dev given that premise you're in charge

1060
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,300
your king for a day.

1061
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,800
Do you go ahead and pardon Trump or do you just let the

1062
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,600
consequences play out?

1063
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,700
I mean, yeah, he's guilty is guilty right and that's how

1064
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,100
it should be obviously.

1065
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,800
But I mean the the question is basically like if it if it

1066
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,100
turns out that Trump is legitimately guilty.

1067
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,700
However, punishing him would lead to a riot and possibly

1068
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,400
a civil war.

1069
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,700
Do you do so the moralist in me says that you have to because

1070
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,100
if you don't what where does that lead down the road, right?

1071
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,500
You have somebody who does all this shit and just because

1072
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,700
he's popular going to let him not do it.

1073
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,200
I mean, you know, you're gonna let me get away with it like

1074
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,000
that sounds like it's a terrible precedent to set.

1075
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I mean some some more cynical people will say well, you know,

1076
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,900
the rich and powerful and connected they already get away

1077
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,000
with it and to some extent they do already get away with

1078
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,200
it. But do you do you want to codify that as the actual

1079
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,800
overt standard?

1080
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,000
I don't think we do.

1081
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,000
I mean is there I mean his whole thing was that I he would

1082
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,900
not vote for Biden if he announced that he would pardon Trump

1083
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,800
because how can we let the you know, someone get away with

1084
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,100
the rule of law and I guess that's another question.

1085
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,300
Would you vote for Biden if he says this is something I'm

1086
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,800
not in one issue right with them.

1087
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,500
I would say that call but uh, I don't need my politicians

1088
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,200
to be perfect and perfectly aligned with my values to vote

1089
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,400
for them.

1090
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:11,800
Sure.

1091
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,300
Sure.

1092
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:12,500
Sure.

1093
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:12,700
Sure.

1094
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,000
Sure.

1095
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,100
Yeah, I don't know.

1096
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,400
I mean if there was a legitimate threat of Civil War, you

1097
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,300
know, how far does that go?

1098
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:26,700
Is there let's be real like if it was going to and I could

1099
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,000
if I could scribe the future and I knew that would lead to

1100
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,800
millions of deaths in a brutal bloody war then maybe I might

1101
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,500
be like, okay.

1102
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,600
Well morals be damned.

1103
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,200
I don't want this but I don't know right.

1104
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,600
I don't know the future like that.

1105
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,400
I can only make decisions based on what I think is best and

1106
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,600
what I think would be happened or think would be happened.

1107
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,500
That's silly what I think would happen in the situation but

1108
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,800
being scared the worst-case scenario.

1109
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,900
I just I don't see a realistic possibility that this is going

1110
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,500
to be a thing.

1111
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,100
Thank you for calling in in pursuit of knowledge anything

1112
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,000
else before I let you go.

1113
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,700
No, that's all catch you later.

1114
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,200
Yeah, like the the fear-mongering.

1115
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,400
Well, if we do this is going to destroy the country.

1116
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,600
Like if this is the rules these are the rules.

1117
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,800
I'm a rule follower.

1118
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,700
Does that make me sorry?

1119
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,200
I don't know.

1120
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:18,900
You okay?

1121
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:21,900
Yes.

1122
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,000
No, basically.

1123
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,400
I had no idea what hold on.

1124
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,200
Okay.

1125
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:31,900
No, sorry about that.

1126
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,100
Sorry.

1127
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,500
Look I you have my full attention just as soon as he left.

1128
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,500
I had a DM from somebody that I had to answer really quick.

1129
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,800
I was actually asking I was asking Pisco in fact about what

1130
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,100
he thought of what Artemis presented and he just call in.

1131
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,500
He just Dino Pisco.

1132
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,000
Yeah, he's been on my show before too.

1133
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:53,200
Oh, yeah, tell him to call in tell him to jump backstage.

1134
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,900
He's in the server.

1135
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,200
Like all the people we've talked about today pretty much

1136
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,100
are in the server watches in the server destination.

1137
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,000
So all of them, you know, they're all allowed to call in

1138
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,500
but while while you do that, I'll bring in the next caller

1139
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,500
and we'll see what they have to say.

1140
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,100
Hello your life.

1141
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Hey, can you hear me?

1142
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:14,900
Yes.

1143
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,300
Hello.

1144
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:21,400
Hey, so I I just wanted to call in because I have some pretty

1145
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,600
detailed knowledge about the tunnel.

1146
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,400
I don't like calling it the new top like gives me a little

1147
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:35,600
bit of the of the ick but I'm like of the wick you mean look

1148
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,600
that's what it is.

1149
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,100
It's a Jewish tunnel.

1150
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,400
They made the tunnel.

1151
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,000
I don't know what does he want to call it?

1152
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,800
How about that Hebrew tunnels?

1153
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,700
Hebrew the Hebrew that's not alliterative.

1154
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,000
I guess you tunnel is in a little bit illiterate.

1155
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,700
Yeah, it's lazy lazy.

1156
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,500
We can do better.

1157
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,700
We'll think of it.

1158
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,200
We'll think of it.

1159
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,900
Okay, the tunnels under New York City that were built by

1160
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,000
Jews go ahead.

1161
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,100
So I live very nearby to there like a couple of blocks away.

1162
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:07,500
I am not a member of I'm not a Chabad Lubavitcher, but I know

1163
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,400
a lot about them and this it's so interesting to me that this

1164
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,500
community is now getting all this attention because of this

1165
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,800
thing going viral.

1166
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,500
But essentially the tunnel is actually the result of a

1167
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,700
religious schism within the Chabad Lubavitcher community.

1168
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,700
It's it how much of the lore about this?

1169
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:38,000
Do you want to know give us give us the you have about 10

1170
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,500
minutes on the call version.

1171
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,000
All right, that's plenty of time.

1172
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,600
So essentially I don't want all 10 minutes to be you explaining

1173
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,200
this by the way, but go ahead.

1174
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,100
Okay, super valid super valid.

1175
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,400
There's a bunch of different Orthodox Jewish communities in

1176
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,900
New York City that all come from different religious dynasties.

1177
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,100
They call them that they came over from Eastern Europe.

1178
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,500
So there's the sat Mars in Williamsburg.

1179
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,000
There's the Lubavitcher in Crown Heights.

1180
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,200
I don't remember what the people in Borough Park are called

1181
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,400
you can tell the difference between them by the way, they

1182
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,300
dress and stuff.

1183
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,800
Anyway, the Chabad Lubavitcher's had this rabbi.

1184
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,500
If you walk around New York City these days, you'll see stickers

1185
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,700
all over the place that have his picture on them.

1186
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,600
Let's say the Messiah is coming or the Messiah is here and

1187
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,800
the difference between those two stickers is part of the

1188
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,600
religious schism where there's essentially three different

1189
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,500
groups of people.

1190
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,900
There's the rabbi died the Reb died in 1994.

1191
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,000
Um, some people think he's just dead and that's it.

1192
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,300
Some people think he was the Messiah and he did die, but

1193
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,900
he's going to come back to life.

1194
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:51,300
Those are the people that say that he's coming and then there

1195
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,000
are other people that think he's here and those people think

1196
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,500
he actually didn't die at all because he was the Messiah.

1197
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,300
And okay, first of all, the rabbi hole is amazing.

1198
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,100
We may call it the rabbi hole from now on.

1199
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,300
But um, I like that rabbi hole.

1200
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,700
Yeah, that's amazing.

1201
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,200
But uh, how does that connect?

1202
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,100
Yeah, what?

1203
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,900
Okay, you got groups.

1204
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,100
They think this dude's a messiah or was the Messiah maybe

1205
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,900
dead tunnels?

1206
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
How does this connect?

1207
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:28,100
So the tunnel that is the subject of all this, you know mess

1208
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:34,200
was dug underneath 770 Eastern Parkway, which amongst people

1209
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,600
in that community is a very famous building because it's

1210
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,700
the synagogue that the Lubavitcher rabbi used during his

1211
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:47,900
lifetime and after he died because of this split amongst

1212
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:48,600
the community.

1213
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:53,100
They weren't able to ever elect a successor and the actual

1214
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,700
building is split in half and the people on top of the building

1215
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,400
are part of the group of people that I think think he's dead.

1216
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,900
The people on the bottom think he's coming back to life and

1217
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,400
the people who dug the tunnel were the people who think that

1218
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,600
he's still alive.

1219
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,300
And they dug the tunnel because he allegedly gave some kind

1220
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:20,200
of commandment that the synagogue needs to be expanded and

1221
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:24,200
they were trying to dig a tunnel from a sort of unused like

1222
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,600
former bathhouse.

1223
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,900
I think either from another building or to another building.

1224
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,100
I don't know exactly.

1225
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,500
I think it was from another building.

1226
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,400
So they could connect them so they could fulfill the Rebs

1227
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,100
commandment of expanding and thereby do a mitzvah, which is

1228
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,500
like the whole if you ever walk around New York will also

1229
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,100
see they'll ask you if you're a Jew all the time all over

1230
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:48,500
the place the same people because they're always trying to

1231
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,900
do mitzvahs because that either makes the Messiah approve

1232
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,300
of you or makes him come back sooner depending on your

1233
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:59,300
interpretation is asking if you're a Jew or not a mitzvah

1234
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,800
is just doing a good thing.

1235
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,800
And it could be any number of different things and asking

1236
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,200
someone if they're Jewish is a good thing because if they

1237
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,700
say yes, then you have them do a prayer with you and having

1238
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,900
a lapsed you do a prayer is one of the biggest mitzvahs

1239
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,300
there is because the whole point is to get all the lapsed

1240
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,300
Jews to become religious again.

1241
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,200
And that's when the Messiah will return.

1242
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,200
I know it sounds completely fucking ridiculous and it is

1243
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:28,000
to me but like it's like the South Park Mormon episode,

1244
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,200
you know where it's like this is what these people actually

1245
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,500
believe. Yeah.

1246
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,200
What do you think Dev?

1247
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,200
I don't I don't know if I have.

1248
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,300
Yeah, I have I have no idea about anything Jewish.

1249
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,300
I can't I don't I don't have anything to say I can't comment.

1250
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,000
I don't know what any of this stuff did.

1251
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,100
It's interesting enough.

1252
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,700
Thanks for calling in about it.

1253
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,600
Well glad you glad you thought it was interesting.

1254
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:57,300
I did I I just look there's got to be better memes out there

1255
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,400
about it though because the truth isn't as important as

1256
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,500
the funny memes, but thank you for calling in friend and

1257
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,500
we'll talk to you later.

1258
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,400
Take okay.

1259
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,000
Yeah, that was a lot.

1260
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,100
He could have just made that all up.

1261
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,100
See this is a problem.

1262
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,500
Like he could have just legit made every single sentence

1263
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,000
of what he said of his explanation up.

1264
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,000
I wouldn't know I've been like, oh really this one.

1265
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,300
That's a I'll have to look into that.

1266
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,600
But it's wild if true.

1267
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:38,100
We'll have to see let's bring in the next we're getting through

1268
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,300
them where I want to get as many people as we can.

1269
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,000
We have a long line and we'll get to as many people as we

1270
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,100
can. Let's bring in the next guest and I do want peace go

1271
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:46,600
to call in.

1272
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:52,000
So then we could pit Artemis foul against peace go that

1273
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,500
would be fun.

1274
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,900
But hello your life.

1275
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,600
That'd be funny actually.

1276
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,400
Yes.

1277
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:57,900
Can you hear me?

1278
01:16:59,400 --> 01:16:59,800
Hello?

1279
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,600
Yep coming through.

1280
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,600
Can I ask to have a question about the Antonio Gramsci

1281
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,000
video? Sure.

1282
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
When you talked about the cultural Marxism Wikipedia page

1283
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,500
you talked about like this woman Joan Braun and then later

1284
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,800
on on stitch and Adam you talked about how a lot of it was

1285
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,300
completely rewritten by her.

1286
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,300
It's not like the entire story about that because that can't

1287
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,100
be the case.

1288
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,700
What do you mean?

1289
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,800
Said that a lot of the cultural Marxism Wikipedia came

1290
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,000
rewritten to her.

1291
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,300
Yes, thank you.

1292
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:44,000
I remember you saying is that is that is that just the entire

1293
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,600
story with that?

1294
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,000
Well, I mean I didn't put this in the video cuz I didn't

1295
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,800
know it at the time but it turned out that a lot of the

1296
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,300
edits to the cultural Marxism Wikipedia page are from her

1297
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:01,300
internet username from back in the day and she just cited

1298
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:05,000
her own paper and because it's like like no one connected

1299
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,700
the dots on that.

1300
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,300
It just stayed and that's what it is now.

1301
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,300
Yes, I just wanted to double check that cuz I just don't

1302
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,200
feel ridiculous.

1303
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:13,900
Thank you.

1304
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,400
Thank you.

1305
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,000
Thanks Dave.

1306
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,000
Yep, that's that's what it is man.

1307
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,600
I mean at some point I might have to do a video on Joan

1308
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,700
Braun but like there's she's like a dime a dozen academic

1309
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:28,200
Of someone who's just like leftist and corrupt and in academia

1310
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,900
and writing completely nonsense fucking papers that are being

1311
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,800
cited with some sort of moral and factual authority because

1312
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,900
it comes from University.

1313
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:38,400
Well, it's kind of like and I do want to talk about this

1314
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:38,600
right?

1315
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,200
It's like the woozle effect and I'm not sure if you've heard

1316
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:42,500
of that.

1317
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,600
Are you familiar with the term?

1318
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:44,600
Nope.

1319
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,700
So what it is is say you publish a paper.

1320
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,500
You're an academic and you publish a paper.

1321
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,600
Okay, then you get your friend.

1322
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,900
To cite your paper.

1323
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:00,600
Okay, and talk about whatever it is the subject racism or

1324
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,900
now you have two papers, right two papers and then you'll

1325
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,700
get a third person to cite that paper and then you will cite

1326
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,700
the third paper and it becomes like a circle right this this

1327
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,700
this woozle effect.

1328
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,700
It's from a Winnie the Pooh story where Piglet and Pooh

1329
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,800
were following their own tracks looking for the woozle, but

1330
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,000
it turns out that they were just following their own tracks

1331
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,700
in the snow.

1332
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,000
And that's what happens a lot with the the citing of the

1333
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,700
sources and things like that is especially in academia is

1334
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,600
they'll all cite each other in this like incestuous circle

1335
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:37,100
jerk of research quote-unquote.

1336
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,800
And so you got to be careful from that and Wikipedia unfortunately

1337
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,600
falls prey to that sometimes because their standards for

1338
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,400
what gets cited as information is it has to be in a book.

1339
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,500
It doesn't have to be cracked.

1340
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:57,400
It just has to be published and so Wikipedia is a good

1341
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,900
place to start looking for things but you should start

1342
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,400
going like you should like read Wikipedia for at least

1343
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,400
the mainstream view which to be honest is generally mostly

1344
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,100
correct with some obvious examples, but generally mostly

1345
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,600
correct but then after you've learned the mainstream view

1346
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,400
you should start reading the sources in the Wikipedia

1347
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,200
article right read the sources directly and then they will

1348
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,500
have sources and you should start like you should at some

1349
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
point start chasing them back, right?

1350
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,300
Thank you, by the way for calling in a record.

1351
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,800
Was that literally all you had?

1352
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,700
Yeah, that's literally all I had.

1353
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,000
It sounded kind of unbelievable.

1354
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,100
Yeah, that's what it is though.

1355
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,800
Speaking of academics.

1356
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,700
I have a PhD that's once Colin Eucharist.

1357
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,300
He's a great guy.

1358
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,900
He's worked in academia and I want to he says he has

1359
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,200
a story about this that he wants to tell us so we're going

1360
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,000
to grab him to call in and tell the story.

1361
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,100
Sure.

1362
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,200
Lusmark you're alive.

1363
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,900
Are you the PhD?

1364
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,000
Can't even hear how to unmute.

1365
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,200
Hello.

1366
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,200
No, I'm sorry.

1367
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,700
My voice is mostly shot.

1368
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,800
So you're gonna have to bear with me.

1369
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,700
Okay, but the phenomenon that you were just describing

1370
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,300
I have a particularly funny story about this.

1371
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,600
So this is a relatively legendary thing from where I went

1372
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,300
to undergrad.

1373
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,700
There was a student in West of class who had just learned

1374
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was reading

1375
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,900
the Wikipedia article and had learned and this is this is

1376
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,900
probably well over 10 years back at this point.

1377
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,100
So Wikipedia moderation standards have improved dramatically

1378
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,200
in the past five to ten years.

1379
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,900
But one way that you used to be able to sneak some really

1380
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:41,900
fun things into a Wikipedia article was by putting a minor

1381
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,900
detail in a sentence that was already footnoted that would

1382
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,800
sort of like escape notice for some time and then sort of

1383
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,300
just get cemented and so he was reading through the narrative

1384
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,800
of Gavrilo Princip pulling out his pistol and shooting the

1385
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,600
Archduke and he added a fun little anecdote in that where

1386
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,000
he said he pulled out his pistol pistol whipped a nearby

1387
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,500
pedestrian and then shot the Archduke and just left it there.

1388
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:11,700
Now if you go Google Gavrilo Princip pistol whip you will

1389
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:14,700
find for example, here's a 2014 article from the Australian

1390
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,100
Broadcasting Company on the anniversary of the beginning

1391
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,300
of World War One that quotes this anecdote that says he pistol

1392
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,200
whipped a nearby pedestrian and then shot the Archduke it

1393
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,800
made it into a high school history textbook made it in newspapers

1394
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,800
and then eventually got you know retroactively cited back

1395
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,800
on to Wikipedia as like well, look these are reputable sources

1396
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,600
that are saying that Gavrilo Princip pistol whipped a nearby

1397
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,700
pedestrian. But if you go back and look at the edit history

1398
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,400
of the article, there's this one fanatical editor who finally

1399
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,800
got it removed because he's like I'm telling you guys this

1400
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,400
wasn't a thing before this original edit all of the sources

1401
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,900
that say it all come from this you guys are crazy.

1402
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,200
He's just going nuts for months trying to get this off

1403
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,000
and finally it's gone, but it happens.

1404
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,800
It really happens.

1405
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:58,600
So I salute you Autis whoever that guy was very very fanatical

1406
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,300
about editing Wikipedia.

1407
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,700
You are the glue that holds us together, but that kind of

1408
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:09,400
a story isn't exactly uncommon.

1409
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,400
It's not rare.

1410
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,000
I should say it's not as rare as you would think and this

1411
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,200
happens with in in especially in kind of streaming circles

1412
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:23,000
a lot too is a rumor will start that will be covered on

1413
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,700
different streams and then it will become it will it will

1414
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:31,800
escape. There's an escape velocity to it where it doesn't

1415
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:35,700
need to stand on any foundation because the foundation

1416
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:38,000
it stands on is now people talking about it.

1417
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,600
I don't know but that's good.

1418
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,400
How are you by the way?

1419
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:41,900
How's it going?

1420
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,500
I'm doing okay other than losing my voice over the past

1421
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:48,100
week. Yeah, I came because I had promised you we would talk

1422
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,100
about the plagiarism stuff on Friday.

1423
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,000
So I wanted to at least get a little bit of it out here

1424
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,800
in the short time that I have because man there have been

1425
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,300
so many things in the past year.

1426
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,400
I don't want to put these on the same level, right?

1427
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,200
They're obviously different but like October 7th is one

1428
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,300
example and the the plagiarism thing is another example

1429
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,500
of just like news stories that more than anything serve

1430
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,500
to like show people's inability to just process facts at

1431
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,100
all where like, you know, so for example like the hospital

1432
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:22,400
bombing in Gaza you saw people who it never could possibly

1433
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,100
have been Hamas or another militant organization that did

1434
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,100
that or it was an accident, you know, it was always going

1435
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,300
to be Israel and vice versa.

1436
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,500
There are people who could never conceive of Israel doing

1437
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,200
something bad same thing with the plagiarism accusations

1438
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,600
obviously again, like probably 10 tears down and importance

1439
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,800
but like there are people who for whom it is inconceivable

1440
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,600
that this woman could ever have intentionally plagiarized

1441
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,900
repeatedly throughout her entire academic career despite

1442
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,700
all evidence and if you think that she did and you think

1443
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,800
she doesn't deserve her post because of that while you're

1444
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,100
part of you know, this right-wing conspiracy here to be

1445
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,400
clear Chris everyone knows what you're talking about.

1446
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,800
The plagiarism thing was Claudine.

1447
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,500
I think that's her first name Claudine Claudine gay Claudine

1448
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,600
gay was the president of Harvard.

1449
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:05,000
She recently stepped down after credible accusations of

1450
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,700
plagiarism hit the news, right and there are

1451
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,400
and I'm sure still are today people who are defending this

1452
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,200
through various variety of reasons.

1453
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,700
One of the reasons that I was called a useful idiot by by

1454
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:31,600
our friend smug bug because smug bug thinks that because

1455
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,500
it was a right-wing organization that pushed this that it

1456
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:39,300
must be something we have to resist because the right-wing

1457
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:44,400
messenger gave the message is something that no good leftist

1458
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,300
would ever countenance.

1459
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,700
I think that's problematic for a few reasons.

1460
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:57,700
One of those reasons being that there is this idea that

1461
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:04,200
the truth is only the truth if it's told by the right people

1462
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,400
and I think that's harmful.

1463
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,100
We even if some even at the worst person, you know tells

1464
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,200
you something that's true.

1465
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,200
It's still true.

1466
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,500
It's still correct.

1467
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,700
It's still something that actually is factually true.

1468
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,900
Now you can you can interrogate their motivations, but when

1469
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,400
it comes to plagiarism, we don't have to interrogate the

1470
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,300
motivations even if they have the worst intentions if they

1471
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:30,500
expose plagiarism plagiarism should be dealt with especially

1472
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,600
if you're a president of a academic institution, I don't

1473
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,000
know especially the most prestigious academic institution

1474
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
in the United States, right?

1475
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,700
Like I mean in her in her New York wasn't New York Times

1476
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:47,700
op-ed after she resigned former president yay said that she

1477
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,100
did receive a lot of like actually explicit racist harassment

1478
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,300
and I believe her I totally believe that there are people

1479
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,200
who were absolutely giddy and gleeful that a black woman

1480
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,000
was falling to this campaign.

1481
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,900
I totally believe that but it my point in the argument was

1482
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,300
smug about on Twitter and and and that I'll stand by is

1483
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:08,500
that it's a type of accusation that doesn't have ammo unless

1484
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,500
the evidence is there her academic record is public.

1485
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,500
You can go look at her articles on Google Scholar.

1486
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,900
You can Google the paragraphs and they will bring up other

1487
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,500
things from other books right then she did not cite them

1488
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,000
appropriately.

1489
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,200
So it's you know, if there are racists who are happy that

1490
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,800
she's fired, you know, I don't like making versus happy but

1491
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,300
sometimes, you know, perfectly reasonable things make bad

1492
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:31,500
people happy right like thought stuff.

1493
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,600
Well initially I was thinking of those two CGP Grey videos

1494
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,300
about following sources back through the centuries you guys

1495
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,200
would know I'm talking about.

1496
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:44,500
Yeah.

1497
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:44,800
Yes.

1498
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:45,600
Yeah.

1499
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,400
Yeah, the Staten Island story about the guy who had barrels

1500
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,700
on his ship and he unleashed them to to win the race and

1501
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,400
then there was the story about Tiffany.

1502
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:57,100
Where did Tiffany first appear in the in the lexicon as

1503
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:01,400
a name right and both of those stories involved him like

1504
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:04,800
reading books that no one's read for like a hundred years

1505
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
and they've just been sitting on the shelf in the back of

1506
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,100
a library somewhere and no one like no one knows anything

1507
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:13,100
about it and no one cares that such obscure knowledge,

1508
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:13,500
right?

1509
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:17,100
So I was I was thinking of that because there's a lot of

1510
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,900
instances where you'll have let's say it's something that's

1511
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,500
true just completely true right and it's in an old book.

1512
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,100
All right.

1513
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:26,300
And then someone will like 20 years later will cite that

1514
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:29,300
off-handedly in their book and then it gets cited again

1515
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,100
and again and it goes like five or six books down changing

1516
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,900
a little bit each time just citing the previous book as

1517
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,800
to where it came from and then it gets then eventually

1518
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,600
as soon as the the internet hits then it's on Wikipedia

1519
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,200
and it's probably in some kind of dumbed down form or

1520
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,000
it's on it's an article somewhere and you know, it's

1521
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,600
it's half truth at best at that point from all the

1522
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,700
transformations it's gone through right?

1523
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,900
So a lot of this sounds like that.

1524
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,800
Well and and one one thing that makes the type of plagiarism

1525
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,000
that she was committing.

1526
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,600
I think so.

1527
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,800
So the reason academics I think should care about it

1528
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,900
so much is when you do omit question marks and citations

1529
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,200
you risk this thing happening even more so you risk just

1530
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,400
stating a claim that someone takes this fact from your

1531
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,000
work. They cite it from your work.

1532
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,400
You haven't cited where you got it from maybe like in

1533
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,400
one instance with her thing.

1534
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,600
She took someone else's paragraph wholesale and changed

1535
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,200
one word.

1536
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,200
It was about the relationship between you know X initiative

1537
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,100
and voting turnout among the black population or something

1538
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,700
like that and the original thing that she copied from

1539
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,700
said it had a negative correlation and she flipped it

1540
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,800
to a positive correlation not on the basis of her own statistical

1541
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:37,100
analysis, but just changing a word and so she's completely

1542
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,700
changed the conclusion that someone else arrived at based

1543
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,500
on their own statistical analysis.

1544
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,500
But now there's a paper out there that I could cite that

1545
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,200
makes that claim that bolsters my evidence right and I

1546
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,400
can't follow her chain back.

1547
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,000
She's she's cut me off from even doing that work the

1548
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,900
hard work to go dig up that book that nobody's ever read.

1549
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,100
You know, like I can't do that anymore when she doesn't

1550
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,000
put quotes when she doesn't cite what she's supposed to

1551
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:57,200
yeah.

1552
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,100
Yeah, that's what we should be able to do theoretically.

1553
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:03,600
Yeah, I think it's just hilarious that the internet has

1554
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,200
been okay.

1555
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,100
Let's say the left-wing internet has been doubling down

1556
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,400
on defending this woman over and over and over because

1557
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,000
she is left-wing herself and she plagiarized what she's

1558
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,900
left-wing at the same time like a week earlier.

1559
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,400
The left-wing internet was in an uproar about plagiarism

1560
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,800
when it was an H bomber guy put out that video.

1561
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,400
Yeah, right about YouTubers played plagiarizing and it's

1562
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,000
like guys like very clearly there's just a partisan angle

1563
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,400
to this right where it doesn't like the plagiarism itself

1564
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,300
doesn't actually matter to these people.

1565
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,700
The only thing that matters is whether their guys are

1566
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:35,600
winning or losing.

1567
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,400
Look this this is what frustrates me because this is

1568
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,300
the first time this has happened and won't be the last

1569
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,600
time this has happened where there's like this huge

1570
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,100
partisan angle to what we think is right or wrong.

1571
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:49,200
I I actually believe in a lot of these these values right

1572
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,200
that leftists claim to hold I actually do believe that

1573
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:56,000
there is that racism is bad like anti-semitism is a problem.

1574
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,300
I do think that plagiarism and stealing other people's

1575
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:03,600
work theft of time and theft of labor are both really big

1576
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,600
issues, right?

1577
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,000
I think that there's all these things at stake, but you

1578
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,700
hurt what I want to happen when you make a game of it when

1579
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,500
you make it this political football game that you're playing

1580
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,900
just to hurt the other team and make sure your team gets

1581
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,800
those touchdowns.

1582
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,400
I don't care about the team.

1583
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,000
The only reason I'm on this team so to speak right is that

1584
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,400
it has the values that I I think are correct and when you

1585
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,100
show that you do not care about those values.

1586
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,500
That's I don't care if your team wins or not at that point,

1587
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,000
right?

1588
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:37,700
I don't know.

1589
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,400
That's just my thought.

1590
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:39,200
Yeah.

1591
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:44,800
Yeah, there's an article in the Harvard Crimson the student

1592
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,100
paper obviously has been covering this a lot and there was

1593
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:51,100
one op-ed by the editorial board that came to her defense.

1594
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,400
I think one thing that gets lost in the whole discussion

1595
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:57,000
is the actual timeline of events where much of the statements

1596
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,200
that Harvard made and that the defenses of her came before

1597
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,800
additional accusations had come to light and been sort of

1598
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,400
adjudicated.

1599
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,800
So there were early accusations that were raised in October

1600
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,500
after the controversy with the congressional hearing.

1601
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,200
So people started digging into her record because she offended

1602
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,000
people and they found these things that look suspicious those

1603
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,300
early ones were like, okay.

1604
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,000
This isn't that bad like she cited this paper elsewhere in

1605
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,500
the dissertation like she could probably could have done

1606
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,700
better and then as time went on more and more things were

1607
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:25,200
found. So the Harvard Crimson editorial board wrote in favor

1608
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,800
of her, but then there was a dissenting member of the undergrad

1609
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,000
Honor Council at Harvard who wrote an essay basically who

1610
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,700
said I get to weigh in on decisions of whether or not someone

1611
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:38,300
gets suspended or expelled at Harvard for exactly this kind

1612
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,700
of stuff. And this is definitionally plagiarism.

1613
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:44,200
I voted to suspend people undergrads at Harvard for violating

1614
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:44,900
this policy.

1615
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,500
How can our president be held to a lower standard than Joe

1616
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,800
Schmoe jr.

1617
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,600
Who copied a paragraph off Wikipedia in his senior seminar

1618
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,300
or whatever, you know, like like how it's a really good op-ed.

1619
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,500
I think like the student is like I take these decisions

1620
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,000
seriously and it doesn't seem like Harvard is as a school.

1621
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,500
So yeah.

1622
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,700
Bro Dev, what were you going to say?

1623
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:06,500
Sorry.

1624
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,300
Yeah, I cut you off there.

1625
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:12,000
So wick you and I had a very short back and forth and it

1626
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
was over Twitter banning like left-wing accounts recently,

1627
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:16,300
right?

1628
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:16,700
Oh, yeah.

1629
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,200
Yeah, I was that was my pocket in case things.

1630
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:19,800
Yeah.

1631
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,300
Well, I don't know.

1632
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,100
I don't know if you were replying to this but I'll just send

1633
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:29,700
you my tweet anyway, but it's basically someone said, you

1634
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:33,300
know a bunch of left-wing accounts and journalism suspended

1635
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,500
from from Twitter and then I posted that xkcd.

1636
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,500
No, I promise you it wasn't a subtweet.

1637
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,500
I've seen a lot of it on my time.

1638
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,600
Okay, people celebrating this happening and saying good

1639
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,100
right like the I'm not necessarily celebrating there is

1640
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,000
some schadenfreude here for sure, but I'm not necessarily

1641
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,800
celebrating but there's that legendary xkcd tweet where

1642
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,600
the person says the right to free speech means the government

1643
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,600
can't arrest you for what you want for what you say is just

1644
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,400
that people listening think you're an asshole and they're

1645
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,600
showing you the door right and whenever let's say, you know

1646
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,300
over the past decade online a right-winger has been censored

1647
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:10,800
and says what about free speech Leftists have always posted

1648
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,900
this comic and they've been very smug about it.

1649
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:13,500
You know what I mean?

1650
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,000
They said well or even crazier you'll like I've seen this

1651
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,200
from let's say even more radical accounts where they'll

1652
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:26,100
say freeze peach freeze and because they make a mockery

1653
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:30,100
of the idea of appealing to free speech and what's underneath

1654
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,300
that this is something that I tried to Hammer home in my

1655
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:38,300
talk on your channel wick with with Karl Max is that you

1656
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:42,300
can't simply have a standard where you are not censored

1657
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,600
and you can have all the debates about your ideas that you

1658
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,600
like but your opponents are censored and the reason you

1659
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,900
can't do that even if you think your opponents are evil

1660
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:54,400
and that it would be good to censor them is because when

1661
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,500
they get power and they will they will turn it around on

1662
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,800
you. And that's what's happening now is that you like

1663
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,100
yeah, the the cultural zeitgeist is shifting rightward a

1664
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,800
little bit right Elon now controls Twitter and you're seeing

1665
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,600
things move in a more rightward direction online and now

1666
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,100
you're seeing Leftists get censored and so the liberal

1667
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:17,400
response to that is hey, we shouldn't be censoring everyone

1668
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,000
which is true and I agree with you on that right, but

1669
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,200
if you if you have if you have if you have a paradigm where

1670
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,900
Every time the left is in power they censor because they

1671
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,800
don't care about liberal principles hypothetically and

1672
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,000
every time I get a hypothetically the right is in power.

1673
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,900
They do care about liberal principles.

1674
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,700
So they don't censor that means that you that you have

1675
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,800
basically a ratcheting effect only moving one way right

1676
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,400
where you have things are pushed leftward and then when

1677
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,300
things swing back, they don't actually swing back.

1678
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:49,600
You just maintain a neutrality of whatever came before

1679
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,400
So there is a good argument that unless your opponents

1680
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,700
commit to not being censorious in the future.

1681
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,900
You must also go against liberal principles and

1682
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:04,900
censor them because liberal principles only work if

1683
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,900
ever it is a trap it is a trap but but you have to

1684
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,200
figure out that not doing it is also a trap though

1685
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,600
because then things will they will just inevitably

1686
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,200
win over enough iterated games, right?

1687
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,400
So you have to say listen, we're going to punish you

1688
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,000
by the same standard that you punished us and we're

1689
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,300
going to do it until you recognize that your standard

1690
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,500
is wrong and you can't do it to us.

1691
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,800
That's not why they're punishing them, right?

1692
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,600
Like that's not why it's happening.

1693
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:33,300
They're doing it because it's team sports and so free

1694
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,600
speech is a big issue of mine.

1695
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,600
And one of the problems I have is that almost no one

1696
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,000
actually believes in it, right?

1697
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,400
A lot of people will say that they believe in it, but

1698
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,800
they'll do this thing where they're always willing to

1699
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,300
censor the other side because they're dangerous and

1700
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:51,000
they're never willing to in any time the same weapon

1701
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,900
is turned on them.

1702
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,700
They decry it, right?

1703
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,200
And one of the things the great things about organizations

1704
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,600
like thefire.org.

1705
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,200
I don't know if you're familiar with them.

1706
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,900
Is that whether you're left right or center, they will

1707
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,900
defend your free speech rights legally, right?

1708
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,100
And that's how it should be.

1709
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:07,300
Yeah.

1710
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah, I agree.

1711
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,700
But the problem becomes is it's a cultural problem

1712
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,100
when we do this.

1713
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,800
Well, it happened to us.

1714
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,200
So now we're going to do it to you to show you what it

1715
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,100
feels like.

1716
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:24,400
It just perpetuates the cycle and so someone has to be

1717
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:29,200
a bigger person and say no, we're not going to continue

1718
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,000
this cycle.

1719
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:33,900
We're going to stop it and we are going to both culturally

1720
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:38,700
and legislatively defang the processes and methods on

1721
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:43,600
which people engage in this attack on free speech.

1722
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:49,100
So they say so I completely agree with you, but I think

1723
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:53,300
that process can only happen after you've given the sensors

1724
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,500
a dose of their own medicine.

1725
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,300
So I can give you two examples, right?

1726
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,500
So one I said when we were talking about this week, I sent

1727
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,300
you that Star Trek The Next Generation clip.

1728
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,200
Yeah, did you watch it?

1729
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,300
No, I got to watch it.

1730
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,300
I'm gonna be real with you.

1731
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,400
Like I saw it on my Twitter.

1732
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,200
I'm like, oh, that's cool.

1733
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,200
I'll watch it later.

1734
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,700
And then I just ever did.

1735
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:13,700
Okay, so the episode is that Picard is kidnapped by aliens

1736
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
and the aliens are actually very benevolent and benign.

1737
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,500
They were just experimenting, right?

1738
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,000
They didn't really hurt him, but then he kidnaps them and

1739
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,400
he holds them and they're like extremely distressed and like,

1740
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,900
oh, you can't be doing this.

1741
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,200
We didn't mean you any harm and it's like well now, you know

1742
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,800
what it feels like you can't do this to me.

1743
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,100
And now that I've done it to you, you're going to know why

1744
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,200
you can't do this to me.

1745
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,200
And that was the lesson he he did it a bit and then he let

1746
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,300
off and said now, you know, and then they parted ways, right?

1747
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,700
And there was no eternal punishment of him.

1748
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:46,200
There was if I thought if I thought that the people in power

1749
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,900
right that we're going to punish the Liberals would just

1750
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:52,900
do it like a card would then maybe I would agree with you,

1751
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:54,300
but they're not going to do that.

1752
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,500
You and I both know they're not going to do that.

1753
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,600
Yeah, it's going to take it away.

1754
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,600
It's escalating my medic cycle.

1755
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,000
Yeah.

1756
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:00,700
Yeah.

1757
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,300
Yeah, the other option is they escalate and that's also

1758
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:03,000
not good, right?

1759
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:06,300
So so there's um, the other the other example is Destiny

1760
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,500
talks about this a lot where Destiny says something like

1761
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:15,000
he seems to be kind of fixated on when Obama's final Supreme

1762
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,700
Court justice was stolen from him because they simply blocked

1763
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,000
it for a year and a half by not holding that hearing.

1764
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:22,600
Remember that work?

1765
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:23,100
I do.

1766
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,100
I remember it.

1767
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,100
Yeah, I remember it distinctly.

1768
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,800
There's all there's a lot of arguments there that that this

1769
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,100
was Harry Reid's fault when he changed the filibuster rules

1770
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,500
anyway, but carry on.

1771
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,400
Yeah, yeah, but basically the even if it was legal it was

1772
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,400
very clearly immoral and against the spirit of how things

1773
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,300
should function right?

1774
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:44,800
Yeah, and so so Destiny's opinion seems to be you know,

1775
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,700
what we should once we once we have the capability to do

1776
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:51,200
so we should do that once to the Republicans just so they

1777
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,700
have a taste of it and then we can say okay, you know, we've

1778
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,000
now hit you back now.

1779
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,700
We both know we can't behave this way but we have but we

1780
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:00,500
can't just get them get away with it.

1781
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,400
We have to do it at least once to them so they know it's

1782
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,700
the same principle here though.

1783
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:07,000
Yeah, but that's never going to be how that works.

1784
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:09,900
What that's going to do is people are going to say oh it

1785
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,800
worked we're going to engage in it to show you a lesson.

1786
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,100
Oh, wait, it actually worked again.

1787
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,200
Hell this is going to be a power politics play from now

1788
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,700
on and now it's normalized in the lexicon of how we behave

1789
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,500
lexicons wrong.

1790
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,100
Yeah, but you know, this is now yeah, but going my biggest

1791
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:28,500
yeah, this is my biggest disagreement with Josiah pondering

1792
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,500
politics first, but whenever I get my voice back, we're

1793
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,700
supposed to talk about this book actually tyranny their

1794
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:36,600
minority same authors who did how democracies die a few

1795
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:40,100
years back and one of their arguments in both books.

1796
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:44,400
Is that you do actually see like a deterioration of like

1797
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,800
cross aisle and Democratic norms in the US particularly

1798
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:51,000
around the Clinton impeachment and like since then things

1799
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,700
have like become in an escalating cycle more and more hostile.

1800
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:57,900
And so for example, like we didn't used to have real controversy

1801
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:00,600
about Supreme Court appointments, but since Clinton we have

1802
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,300
on both sides.

1803
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:04,200
And so I'm yeah, I'm not convinced that there's ever going

1804
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,100
to be a point where one side says well you did this and

1805
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,300
now we get to clap back and that's going to be it like you

1806
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:12,900
understand now how bad it's going to be I see it like yet

1807
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,600
more like the ratcheting or more like I love Renee Gerard

1808
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,400
and he talks about escalating cycles of imitative violence

1809
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,500
and I think that's just sort of what's happening.

1810
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,500
I don't know how it ends until one side decides to be principled

1811
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,000
and and not do that but then that requires you know, a lot

1812
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,900
of sacrifice as well.

1813
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:31,500
So, yeah, I just I don't see where that definitive point

1814
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,800
is where like I love Star Trek and I love that example.

1815
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:35,400
I think it's great.

1816
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,400
I think that's how it would work in an ideal world like

1817
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,900
a lot of things in Star Trek, but unfortunately we're stupid

1818
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:43,300
and not rational and that's not how people actually work,

1819
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:43,700
right?

1820
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:47,000
So here's the thing right because the options only seem

1821
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:52,300
to be you you give your opponents as much unfairness as

1822
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:56,100
they give use to teach them and then you stop or you both

1823
01:41:56,100 --> 01:42:00,300
escalate or you do nothing and allow them to escalate

1824
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:03,900
unopposed and then like then you just lose right now.

1825
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,500
There seems to be no other option.

1826
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:06,200
No, Dev.

1827
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,400
I disagree that you lose in that case.

1828
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,900
What you do is you draw a delineation distinction in the

1829
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:14,400
voters minds between it's been okay.

1830
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,700
I'm talking about liberal democracies here, which we live

1831
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:19,900
in. Okay, I'm not going to I'm not going to posit on whether

1832
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:24,100
this works in a another system, but in our system what

1833
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:27,300
you do is you say okay these this is why we're different.

1834
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:31,600
We have principles they do not and generally this gives

1835
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,800
you elections, right?

1836
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,100
This is why you win elections generally and that's going

1837
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,200
to happen all the time.

1838
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:39,300
It's not going to be a clear and present thing.

1839
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:42,600
But when you stoop to their level what you do is you make

1840
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,800
it a situation where people cannot tell the difference between

1841
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:49,000
you and them and then why would they vote for you over them?

1842
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Because I mean then it's just they can't they can't tell

1843
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,700
you're both engaging in the same kind of chicanery and so

1844
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,400
see that this this this makes sense up until the point that

1845
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,300
the other side is actually able to fuck with how elections

1846
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:07,000
are run and then this breaks down because then it doesn't

1847
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
matter who votes for you.

1848
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:13,100
As long as we're referencing apt sci-fi things, you know,

1849
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:17,500
this my position I think is like the the war games position

1850
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,500
right you the only winning move is not to play right like

1851
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,800
that. You can't once you get in the cycle like everybody

1852
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,300
dies or you know, somebody taps out.

1853
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:29,900
Those are the only two options and in my estimation unless

1854
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:34,000
unless we actually have strong enough institutional bullworks

1855
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,700
that punish people when they start stepping out of the real

1856
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:40,200
bounds, but I'm I used to be very optimistic about that.

1857
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,100
I don't know if I am anywhere.

1858
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,700
Honestly, I think America does I mean I've been following

1859
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:46,000
the various Trump indictments.

1860
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,500
I think he's totally fucked at least on the documents case.

1861
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,100
The other ones are hitting this but like we'll see but if

1862
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,800
you see that the most recent Michigan poll like he's up eight

1863
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,800
points in Michigan right now, Michigan.

1864
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:58,700
It's insane.

1865
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,200
Like I if I was Biden I would be quaking right now if that's

1866
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,200
if it's a good poll and all that blah blah blah, you know

1867
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,000
political science stuff.

1868
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,200
That's I did I did fake political science.

1869
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,200
I do political theory, but my friends who do real political

1870
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:12,500
science. Tell me all of these things so but that's should

1871
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,900
be scary if you don't want Trump to win and I don't want

1872
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:18,700
Trump to win even though I'm a conservative so like I don't

1873
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:21,300
know what a second Trump presidency looks like.

1874
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:23,900
I think it looks like gutting all those bulwarks.

1875
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,300
I'm confident in if yeah, you all of these cases could stick

1876
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:29,100
if they give him house arrest and he's still on the ballot

1877
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,800
and he gets re-elected what happens?

1878
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,800
I don't know.

1879
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:38,600
Yeah, I mean I do like the the idea of Trump goes to jail,

1880
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,400
but he's also the president and then you have like his Secret

1881
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,600
Service in the jail with him because that could be that

1882
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,800
could be like a hilarious movie, but it's yeah, it's it would

1883
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:48,900
make a fun movie.

1884
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:49,500
You're correct.

1885
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:54,400
But a reality would be no, I don't want to know that Trump

1886
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,300
Trump ruling the country from jail.

1887
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:57,000
Oh my God.

1888
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:57,400
Listen.

1889
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,400
I'm glad I'm not an American you guys have fun with that

1890
01:44:59,400 --> 01:44:59,800
shit.

1891
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,400
You Chris.

1892
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,700
Thank you for calling in.

1893
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,400
I'm sorry that you're not feeling well.

1894
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,400
Well, that's great.

1895
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,100
I'm sorry.

1896
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:11,800
I just your chat has this neon Reagan guy who put conservative

1897
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,200
and scare quotes fight me you Chris on Discord message me

1898
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:14,600
anytime.

1899
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,900
Let's ha ha ha neon Reagan's from my community.

1900
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:20,400
He is like a he's a paleoconservative.

1901
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:25,200
Oh, well, then we have more overlapping things, but he is

1902
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,800
a pro Trump paleoconservative.

1903
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,900
Oh, well, then that's stupid.

1904
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,600
Okay, that's fine.

1905
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:31,600
Okay.

1906
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:34,100
Thank you for calling in you guys.

1907
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,300
I like you Chris you Chris is one of the original Wickers

1908
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:45,700
who would go and talk with me when I was like had two people

1909
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,100
watching me, right?

1910
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,000
So really good guy.

1911
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:51,900
He's fun to argue with I have some substantive disagree with

1912
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:55,800
some of them on a few things, but I think that overall whip

1913
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:00,500
smart honest honest guy genuine and he's a PhD so I get to

1914
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,600
throw that around a little bit.

1915
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,500
So yeah, yeah.

1916
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:04,900
I mean, oh man.

1917
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:10,000
When it comes to the the whole academic thing the go-to food

1918
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,700
shops in the chat, she knows what I'm talking about the go-to

1919
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:19,900
is when for me just to show some of the the obvious bias is

1920
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:24,200
when academic agent got fired right back in like 2019.

1921
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:24,700
Do you remember that?

1922
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:27,800
Do you remember the story there wasn't this President Sunday

1923
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,300
related?

1924
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,900
Yes, it was vaguely remember it remind me.

1925
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:36,100
Yeah, so academic agent.

1926
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:40,400
He ran like an anti SJW YouTube channel the back in that era

1927
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,400
of YouTube and he was definitely like a center-right type

1928
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:43,800
of guy.

1929
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:48,000
But President Sunday back in the day.

1930
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,900
This is in years and years and years ago got together a crowd

1931
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:54,000
of people to send a bunch of messages to his University

1932
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,700
because he was a professor at a University in the UK.

1933
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:01,100
So they spam the University with various reports and they

1934
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:02,700
said this in this guy.

1935
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:04,400
He's a threat to your students.

1936
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,300
He's far right and because the UK is way more sensitive

1937
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,800
to the sort of stuff in America is he lost his job and

1938
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,200
he can't he still has some connections in publishing.

1939
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,400
So he's been publishing new books, but he doesn't teach

1940
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:15,800
anymore.

1941
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:18,800
Like he was he was kicked out of academia despite having

1942
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:19,500
his PhD.

1943
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,100
It's like that sounds ridiculous in my opinion, even though

1944
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:25,100
I just I don't agree with him and I mean since being isolated

1945
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:28,000
academic agent has radicalized very far right, but I don't

1946
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
necessarily blame him for that because no one came to his

1947
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,300
offense except for the right wingers.

1948
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,000
Yeah, that that's how that works.

1949
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:36,000
This is a tale as old as time right you kick them out.

1950
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,500
So there's no one no one sane will associate with them and

1951
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
well, who are they going to who they're going to turn to

1952
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,500
because they're not going to cease to exist, right?

1953
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:49,300
They're just go with the people who will listen and talk

1954
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:52,100
to them and they ain't going to get pushback on their crazy

1955
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:53,000
ideas anymore.

1956
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:56,700
But no, I think that it's just scummy all around that whole

1957
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,100
story.

1958
01:47:57,100 --> 01:48:00,700
So so so the academic agent story is where I first started

1959
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:04,700
really paying attention to not just, you know, personal

1960
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:07,000
left-wing bias, which I experienced a lot when I was in

1961
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,500
University myself, but also institutional left-wing bias

1962
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,800
where the rules actually are just applied one way.

1963
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:18,700
And so for me once I saw the the Harvard plagiarism story

1964
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,000
that was just like another data point in a very long list

1965
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:22,600
of data points.

1966
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,500
I've been collecting for like five years now of just how

1967
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,000
how left-leaning academia is.

1968
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:32,200
And and there's probably some there's probably some natural

1969
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:35,700
inclination for academia to be left-leaning because the

1970
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:38,000
right does tend to be more intellectual focused and the

1971
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,800
left is like more blue-collar focus.

1972
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,500
So there's probably some natural probably some of the

1973
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:47,200
left-leaning ness of it is just how it how it is naturally,

1974
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,400
but I think a lot of it is definitely like artificially

1975
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:53,500
imposed and they're rigorously gatekeeping other ideas.

1976
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,900
Yeah institutional capture.

1977
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,600
Yeah, it's this idea.

1978
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:59,300
Well, yeah, I'm on man's I won't explain it to you, right?

1979
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:04,500
You know what I'm talking about, but I I think it's getting

1980
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,800
better. I think that this is evidence of it getting better

1981
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,400
because it this had happened in 2020.

1982
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,800
We wouldn't have had the same outcome.

1983
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,200
I think that funnily enough October 7th and the response

1984
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:23,700
to it by a lot on the far left really just there is a

1985
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:27,100
there's a there's going to be a divorce between certain

1986
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:32,000
segments left the people who cheered and the people who

1987
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,900
who didn't on October 7th, right?

1988
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:39,000
I think that we're going to have a far-reaching.

1989
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,200
Yeah differences.

1990
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,600
So what was what's really funny is like when I went through

1991
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,000
my leaving the left moment, it was 10 years ago, right?

1992
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:53,400
And October 7th was something that I knew was coming for

1993
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,100
a long time now like not that specific event.

1994
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:01,900
But this idea this idea that liberals would eventually

1995
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:05,200
see the liberals who didn't get like slowly pushed into

1996
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,200
the socialist camp.

1997
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,400
The liberals would eventually see exactly who they buddied

1998
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:13,200
up with during the 2016 to 2020 era because there was a

1999
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,700
lot of just broad leftist unity in the face of you know,

2000
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:20,800
Trump getting elected and Bolsonaro and Brexit and there

2001
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,600
seem to be the slow rise of the right-wing in liberal

2002
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,800
democracies, which is still continuing in Europe.

2003
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,500
There's no right-wing or right-wing parties are still

2004
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,100
getting elected.

2005
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:31,500
I saw that happen in Argentina as well video recently.

2006
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,200
Did you see that one where they're all doing the Nazi

2007
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,000
salute or whatever?

2008
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,300
Which one was that?

2009
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,600
It was very recent.

2010
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,100
I think it was Italy could be could be Spain, but maybe

2011
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:45,100
like a huge crowd of people all just doing the Nazi salute,

2012
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:50,100
but yeah, so there has been this slow rise of the right

2013
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,000
for sure.

2014
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:54,700
And I think in least in the English-speaking world the

2015
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:58,800
broader left United in the face of that but then after

2016
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,300
you know, Trump Trump lost in 2020.

2017
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:04,500
They kind of had to figure out why they were together and

2018
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,200
I think October 7th was I knew something like this would

2019
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:11,000
happen where liberals realized why hey you actually don't

2020
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,500
fit with leftist all that much.

2021
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,100
I didn't know what it was going to be but it was going

2022
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:15,200
to be some big event.

2023
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,700
It turned out to be October 7th, right?

2024
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,400
So I see I see Brianna Wu, for example tweeting stuff that

2025
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,200
I was saying 10 years ago and it's like you're going through

2026
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,000
the exact same thing.

2027
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I went through 10 years ago.

2028
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,700
The reason I went through through it 10 years ago is because

2029
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,600
for me it wasn't a public event for me.

2030
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:31,400
It was being in University and reading a lot of their political

2031
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,600
theory and figuring out where it goes, you know, we all get

2032
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:37,500
there in different ways.

2033
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,700
I like to hear a lot of different perspectives for me.

2034
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,500
It's not so much a left versus right thing.

2035
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,900
It's extremist versus non extremist thing.

2036
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,000
Like I can get I can get along with a right-wing moderate

2037
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
right or someone who's a moderate and has very conservative

2038
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,700
views. I would get along with that person but extremists

2039
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:02,200
on either side even even an extremist who takes all my values

2040
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:05,100
everything I want but they're extreme about it and they're

2041
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:06,800
extreme about the ways they go about it.

2042
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:07,900
It's something I don't want.

2043
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,200
I don't want to associate with.

2044
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,800
Well associates the wrong word.

2045
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,700
I don't want to be on their team because I think that the

2046
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:19,400
extreme nature of how you engage with the world affects like

2047
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:24,100
it takes everything you touch it twists and contorts things

2048
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:27,800
that I would consider values to be weapons in a lot of ways

2049
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,900
and I don't like it.

2050
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:33,900
So speaking of a speaking of extremism food shops after

2051
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,200
announced to you guys food shops is in fact coming becoming

2052
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,300
a right-wing extremist.

2053
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:38,900
She's going through it right now.

2054
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:43,000
I want to she's been reading Mencius mold bug.

2055
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,900
She's been reading Mencius mold bug and she's becoming a

2056
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:45,700
right-wing extremist guys.

2057
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:46,300
You have to understand.

2058
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,700
I don't I don't want to talk about food shops too much because

2059
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:50,300
she can't defend herself on my channel.

2060
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,500
She got banned because of the peto stuff.

2061
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,100
But uh, wait from your server.

2062
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:54,600
She's banned.

2063
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,300
She can't come in.

2064
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:55,900
She's banned.

2065
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:57,900
Um, I don't know what you mean about it.

2066
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2067
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,300
Was this your ruling or your mods or what?

2068
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:06,100
My mods, my mods and my admins made this decision.

2069
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:11,000
I haven't looked into the the I have seen I've heard some

2070
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:11,500
of the clips.

2071
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:12,700
They don't look good.

2072
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:16,600
I have been meaning to get around to talking to her directly

2073
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:17,200
about it.

2074
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,400
Unfortunately holidays Etc.

2075
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:22,400
I haven't yeah until I figure it out.

2076
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:26,500
I'm gonna hold this for I looked into it.

2077
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:31,200
Yeah, and I mean the I looked into it and she just seems to

2078
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,900
be like schizo, which is fine.

2079
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:34,400
It's fun.

2080
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,200
But like like here's the thing.

2081
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,300
I don't think everyone's like she's a pedophile.

2082
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,000
I don't think she's a real pedophile guys.

2083
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:45,100
I just think she has zero tacked zero ability to form a coherent

2084
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:45,700
sentence.

2085
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,800
No idea what when to not say the edgy joke and it's like,

2086
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:54,000
okay, I did the clips I've seen and their clips to be fair

2087
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,500
didn't sound like a joke.

2088
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,000
It sounded like her argument.

2089
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:01,100
Um, well also also here's the thing like like for me.

2090
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:03,000
Here we can move away from food drops.

2091
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:04,300
Thanks, Deb.

2092
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,500
She says in the chat.

2093
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,100
Okay, here we can move away from food drops.

2094
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,100
Like I personally don't care that much about the drawn

2095
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:15,000
lolly stuff because it's a drawing.

2096
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
It's like I whatever I don't care, you know, if you don't

2097
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,700
like if you like it, I don't care if you don't like it.

2098
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:19,200
I don't care.

2099
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,000
There are people who there are people who came over this

2100
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,800
with the people who want to treat drawings as if they're

2101
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,500
the exact same morally as real child porn.

2102
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,500
I think that's ridiculous.

2103
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:32,300
No, but it's like something can be worse.

2104
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:35,400
But the original thing is still not good and not something

2105
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,400
I want right?

2106
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:39,500
Yeah, I don't I don't know.

2107
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,300
I'd have to again.

2108
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,800
I have to talk to her at some point.

2109
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:44,400
Let's have the lolly debate with let's do it.

2110
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,400
We might have the lolly debate.

2111
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,200
We can do it right now.

2112
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:49,400
We can we can monetize the shit out of it.

2113
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,400
Why do it right now?

2114
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,700
Well, we can make a production value of it.

2115
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:56,900
Dev as the defense attorney for food stamps, right comes

2116
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:00,000
on my show, right and then we'll have a prosecutor right

2117
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,800
going and we'll and I'll be the judge.

2118
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:06,100
I'll wear a wig will make some money and like if you if

2119
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:09,500
you super chat will get that'll be like the jury, right?

2120
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,400
Well, it's super chat to do the journey.

2121
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:11,700
Nice.

2122
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:12,700
Yeah, it'll be great.

2123
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,000
But let's bring another color.

2124
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,300
We've we've convinced that I want to get as many people as

2125
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:16,900
we possible.

2126
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,200
I know I said one to two hours, but we got a lot of people

2127
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:21,800
so I don't know if you have anywhere to be or no, I'm good.

2128
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,100
Let's go.

2129
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,100
Okay, I can probably do do like one more hour.

2130
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:26,600
One more hour ish.

2131
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:26,900
Okay.

2132
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,900
Well probably goes.

2133
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:28,300
Okay.

2134
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,200
We'll see how it goes.

2135
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:32,800
But and you thought that this wasn't going to be interesting.

2136
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:33,900
We have nothing to talk about.

2137
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,500
You're foolish.

2138
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,200
Let's bring in the next contestant on whatever the fuck

2139
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:38,700
this is.

2140
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:40,400
I still hope Brianna Wu shows up at the end.

2141
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,000
Maybe again.

2142
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,200
I'll send her another DM my alibi.

2143
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:45,900
Hello your life.

2144
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:54,500
Oh, how about now?

2145
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,000
How's good now?

2146
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
It's good greetings.

2147
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:58,600
Yo.

2148
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,900
Well, that's a lot to follow up of that was a good conversation

2149
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:05,900
and all that but I'll do my best.

2150
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:10,200
Well, yeah for us.

2151
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:17,900
Well, so one I was backing off a topic earlier because I had

2152
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:21,300
some interaction with it but like political labels where

2153
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:25,300
liberal versus conservative people on the far left don't

2154
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:27,400
like to call other liberals.

2155
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:30,900
They'll just call them conservative neoliberal use

2156
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:36,100
pejoratives and stuff and how again we can't even come down

2157
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:40,300
to like simple facts on how to kind of label people or where

2158
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:41,000
they fit in.

2159
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
And like on the liberal side you have people who are pro Israel

2160
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,600
and also pro Palestine, but then someone who might be pro

2161
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:57,800
Israel a lot of extreme leftists won't like to call them

2162
01:56:58,600 --> 01:56:59,400
liberal at all.

2163
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,400
Yeah, so let's go ahead.

2164
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:07,400
No, I agree with your point here.

2165
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,300
Yeah, they go on continue.

2166
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:18,100
So like where do you know it because also the PhD guy who

2167
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:21,500
was on earlier and I enjoyed that talking about kind of the

2168
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:27,000
processing of facts how stuff can be edited.

2169
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:31,500
How do you get people to come to kind of a common agreement

2170
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,600
of what they call liberal or conservative and like just

2171
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:41,800
because you don't agree with one liberal position doesn't

2172
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:44,500
mean you're conservative and again, you're just bad faith

2173
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:48,700
if you're so I think this is a this is a problem about people

2174
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:52,500
swallowing an identity and making their identity or their

2175
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:55,800
political party part of who they are as a person.

2176
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:00,400
I have certain values right that I believe in.

2177
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:05,400
More leftist progressive kind of things tend to fit with

2178
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:09,000
most not all but most of those values tend to align with

2179
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,200
them if that ever stopped being the case, right if that

2180
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:16,400
ever changed I wouldn't follow the label.

2181
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:21,300
I would follow the value and I think a lot of people are

2182
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:25,800
the opposite of that they are invested in saying hey, I'm

2183
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:31,100
a leftist or I'm a this and so if you are not this right

2184
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:34,000
if you don't have the same beliefs I do you cannot be a

2185
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:40,300
this and even when those parties change or those tribes

2186
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:45,200
change they will cling to this and so they try to kind of

2187
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:49,900
like gate keep the word or gate keep the label and push

2188
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:53,200
people out that they disagree with and keep a pull in that

2189
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,400
they don't but I don't get tied to it like that.

2190
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,200
So to answer your question.

2191
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,800
How do we get people to come to a common understanding?

2192
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:03,700
I don't I don't give a shit what someone says it's conservative

2193
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:04,100
or not.

2194
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:05,900
I'm like, okay conservative cool.

2195
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:07,300
What are they actually saying?

2196
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,900
What's their proposal right?

2197
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,200
What are they advocating for?

2198
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,900
Is that good or is that bad?

2199
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,400
It's very simplified way of thinking it but it is what it

2200
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:18,100
is then I'll be okay with it or not.

2201
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:20,200
I don't I don't care if they call it conservative or not.

2202
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,100
What do you know that's a hundred a hundred percent fair.

2203
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,600
I would say even growing up when talking politics with my

2204
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,500
family, they would always like to label me.

2205
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:33,500
Oh, wait, you are are you conservative you libertarian

2206
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:37,800
you neoliberal and I always kind of yeah shocked those

2207
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,500
labels and much rather like what's your opinion on this

2208
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,100
and this?

2209
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,800
Because it can be very nuanced.

2210
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:47,300
What do you think that?

2211
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:49,400
Yeah, pretty much.

2212
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:52,900
I mean, I'm kind of feel the same way right if I if if my

2213
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:57,200
ideals like if society shifted in my ideals became known

2214
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:59,500
as far right then that's what I would be I wouldn't care

2215
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:01,100
too much right or far left.

2216
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:02,200
I still wouldn't care too much.

2217
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,000
So okay, I guess I guess that's where I am.

2218
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,400
I guess I'm far left or far right now fine fine.

2219
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:09,200
What matters are the ideas themselves, right?

2220
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:12,800
And here's the thing when it comes to when you're arguing

2221
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,700
over labels rather than arguing over ideas.

2222
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,100
What's really happening there is you're trying to place

2223
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:22,800
a moral judgment on someone right?

2224
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:27,000
So so for example, like when someone calls you a fascist

2225
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,900
let's say they're left-wing and they call you a fascist.

2226
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:33,800
What they're really saying is you're you are bad thing

2227
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:36,300
and therefore you should you therefore you should be about

2228
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:37,700
it. It's a moral judgment, right?

2229
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,700
And the issue ultimately the issue ultimately is that if

2230
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:44,200
you were to actually meet a real fascist someone who genuinely

2231
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,400
believed in those values and thought they were good.

2232
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:49,300
They wouldn't be insulted by you calling them a fascist.

2233
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:51,100
They just be like, yeah, that's that's what I am right.

2234
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:52,900
They wouldn't it wouldn't be an insult.

2235
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:56,600
So the idea of attaching moral weights to labels and then

2236
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:57,600
slapping people with them.

2237
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:00,300
It doesn't really work and it really doesn't work to actually

2238
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:01,700
discredit ideas, right?

2239
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:07,800
Like everyone everyone everyone on Twitch poll, I think at

2240
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:10,400
one point or another probably even including myself frankly

2241
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:15,000
has simply used fascist as like a sentence ender or like

2242
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,400
like an argument ender where it's like, well, you believe

2243
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:19,800
in X policy.

2244
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,900
Well, that's a fascist policy and it's like well, what's

2245
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:22,700
the rest of the argument?

2246
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:25,500
That's the rest of the argument that's being smuggled in

2247
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,700
there is fascism is immoral.

2248
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:30,100
So you shouldn't believe in this policy, right?

2249
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:34,200
But that's frankly not a good enough not a good enough way

2250
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,300
to talk to argue him up.

2251
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:38,100
And I actually think this is a conversation win the argument

2252
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:41,200
for a long time though, but it's always I think it's not

2253
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,900
good enough anymore getting to that point where people are

2254
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:43,900
seeing through it, right?

2255
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:46,800
Well, it ships the argument because you have to defend yourself

2256
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,400
not being a fascist over whatever you were originally talking

2257
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,800
about. Well, there's there is that but there's also the fact

2258
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,500
that you know seven or eight years ago.

2259
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:55,500
It was racist, right?

2260
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:56,300
Everyone's like you're racist.

2261
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:56,700
You're racist.

2262
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:59,900
You're white male racist, but that got to a point where

2263
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:03,300
now no one gives a shit if you're called a racist sometimes

2264
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:04,300
they'll just be like, yes, I am.

2265
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:04,700
Fuck you.

2266
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:07,200
Just just like him to fuck off, you know, and then which

2267
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,300
by the way one that has allowed a lot of real racist

2268
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:11,300
to get smuggled back into the conversation, right?

2269
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:14,700
But secondly it they've now had to shift to a different

2270
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:17,100
word and right now the word is fascist and we're approaching

2271
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:19,800
that point to where nobody cares.

2272
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:21,200
It's not there yet.

2273
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:22,700
Maybe another six months to a year.

2274
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:25,700
Nobody cares if they call you a fascist anymore in the which

2275
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:28,400
by the way one that allows fascist to come back in the

2276
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:33,100
conversation, but to that offers no argument against fascism's

2277
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:34,900
here you go.

2278
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,800
Here the optics go out the window fascism's positive qualities,

2279
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:39,100
which it does have some right.

2280
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:42,000
So like you have to you have to balance this where it's

2281
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,400
like you have to actually argue against the policies themselves

2282
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:48,200
and not really care what label they're under the the winner

2283
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:52,600
in the story of the boy who cried wolf was the wolf and

2284
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:58,100
you're exactly right the people when you are watering down

2285
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:01,700
and flattening a term so that it just has very little meaning

2286
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:02,300
anymore.

2287
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:06,000
It helps the people who are actually those things to as

2288
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,200
you say get smuggled back into society because the accusation

2289
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:13,200
holds no way because it's very important right when someone

2290
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:18,000
is doing fascist things that actually will be authoritarian

2291
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
take away democracy take away people's freedoms of choice

2292
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,600
take away people's free speech.

2293
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:27,300
Etc to be able to tell people that and rather than go through

2294
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,800
a whole litany shorthand is useful.

2295
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:33,600
But again, we've over overplayed our hand.

2296
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:34,600
I agree with you.

2297
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:35,100
Yeah.

2298
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:39,700
Actually here to to bring food shops back up again.

2299
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:41,900
I had a had this conversation with her like last week.

2300
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,700
Okay, and well, I was trying to explain this idea to her

2301
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:48,100
basically and it was basically that okay if you're gonna talk

2302
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:51,400
to a like a real fascist if you just because I think I think

2303
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:54,200
she talked to Big Papa fascist at one point and like you

2304
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:58,000
can't just scream about how your opponent's ideals are immoral

2305
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,500
because they don't share that that that view of it with you.

2306
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,600
So it's not an argument to them.

2307
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:03,800
You have to she says in the chat.

2308
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:04,800
I live in dev walls.

2309
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,200
Fuck you.

2310
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:08,000
Okay, so so listen listen what you have to actually do many

2311
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:08,700
times you bring her up.

2312
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:09,200
So go ahead.

2313
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,500
Okay.

2314
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:09,700
Okay.

2315
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:09,900
Yeah.

2316
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,900
Yeah, we have what you have to do is you actually have to

2317
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:18,100
show how their own positive qualities are not fulfilled by

2318
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:19,800
the Paul by the policies they want to implement right?

2319
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,300
So for example, if you talk to a fascist and assuming he's

2320
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:23,000
honest with you.

2321
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:26,600
He'll say that like order is a great positive quality in

2322
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,300
society, right?

2323
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,500
Like you want an orderly society.

2324
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:30,600
That's why that's why they're so strict with things right,

2325
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:34,800
but then you realize that once you what once you centralized

2326
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:39,200
all power into the great leader into one person your society

2327
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:42,600
be that's a single point of failure for society, right?

2328
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:46,100
So, you know hypothetically if Joe Biden is assassinated

2329
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:48,900
today America will have a crisis.

2330
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:50,300
It may even go to war.

2331
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:53,400
However, your government doesn't collapse because you have

2332
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:56,700
chain of command you have succession things are set up and

2333
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:59,200
power is devolved to hundreds or thousands of different

2334
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,500
people in hundreds of thousands of different offices all

2335
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:05,200
over the country, right if you assassinate Hitler Nazi Germany

2336
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:10,800
dies and so when the fascist says I want order you have to

2337
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,700
be able to show them that well you might want order but the

2338
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:17,400
way you set up your society is act does not actually guarantee

2339
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:21,200
any order and in fact liberal democracies in their decentralization

2340
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:23,100
guarantee more order, right?

2341
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:27,000
So there is in my opinion a good argument against fascism

2342
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:30,400
and I didn't once have to soy out about how immoral it is.

2343
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:31,700
You know what I mean?

2344
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:36,800
You didn't have to yeah, but no, thank you my alibi for calling

2345
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:37,900
it a great topic.

2346
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:38,800
Great question.

2347
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:40,800
Is there anything else you have before we let you go?

2348
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:44,700
Um, no, not really that kind of covers it.

2349
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:48,800
The only other like before you throw me off into the void

2350
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:53,100
would say I would guess like while there are select few

2351
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:56,100
people who would welcome the label fascist.

2352
02:05:56,500 --> 02:06:02,000
I think there are a lot of people that if the term that

2353
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,400
would readily like deny it just because kind of like you

2354
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:09,500
were saying they think morally different they disagree

2355
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:12,000
with you, but they're like the moral outcomes of what

2356
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:17,200
their beliefs are wouldn't make them believe their effect.

2357
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:20,300
Yeah, we're the one of the reasons we're so hesitant to

2358
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:24,100
take a good conservative or good progressive or good leftist

2359
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:30,200
whatever whatever ideology you think of as bad is because

2360
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:34,200
we have spent so much time and so much so much blood sweat

2361
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:38,300
and tears has been spent as tying that political label of

2362
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:39,900
our enemies to be evil.

2363
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:43,600
And so they can't have a good idea because they are evil

2364
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:47,700
and this is a problem and it's made it very very hard to

2365
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:51,000
work with each other and very very hard to work across

2366
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,300
the aisle every time someone on one team or the other tries

2367
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:55,600
to work with the other team.

2368
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:58,700
They are seen as traitors in a lot of ways to and are often

2369
02:06:58,700 --> 02:06:59,500
primary now.

2370
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:01,000
It's a big problem.

2371
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:03,600
It's something we have to I don't know what to do about

2372
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:05,700
it, but it's something we're going to have to deal with

2373
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:06,900
at some point, right?

2374
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Well another part of the another part of this conversation

2375
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,100
though something you mentioned earlier my my alibi is that

2376
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,200
they wouldn't say that they're fascist and a lot of that

2377
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,300
comes down to like if you were to like go to Nick Fuentes,

2378
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:19,300
for example and say are you a fascist?

2379
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:21,800
He'll probably say no and what he'll say is you mean I'm

2380
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:24,300
obviously not you know, a member of the Italian fascist

2381
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:28,800
party or the Nazi German party, you know because fascism

2382
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:33,100
today looks very different from fascism back then right

2383
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:35,800
and because ideas do change and like like the liberals of

2384
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:37,400
today are not the same thing as the liberals of a hundred

2385
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:38,200
years ago, right?

2386
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:42,600
So things do like there is a genealogy you can trace back

2387
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:45,000
through through political ideologies to see where things

2388
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,700
came from but today's fascists are not the same thing

2389
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:54,400
as Mussolini in 1910 coming up with a new ideology, you

2390
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:54,900
know what I mean?

2391
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,600
So they would probably it's a word game.

2392
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,100
But if you're educated enough on why the policies are bad,

2393
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:05,500
you don't need to you don't need to do the moral condemnation

2394
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:08,300
educating ourselves as streamers.

2395
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:09,200
What are you talking about?

2396
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,200
What are you talking about?

2397
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,700
To the void to the void.

2398
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:15,700
They kicked him out.

2399
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:16,200
I did.

2400
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,000
Well, he I told him he's gonna go to the void.

2401
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:19,000
I let him listen.

2402
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:19,900
Look listen chat.

2403
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:22,200
If you want to if you want to go down another rabbit hole

2404
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,400
of weird fringe ideologies that like only if like a dozen

2405
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:30,900
people actually follow go to the Wikipedia page for a

2406
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:32,200
narco nationalism.

2407
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:35,500
Okay, narco nationalism.

2408
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:38,600
I've heard of narco capitalism, but narco nationalism.

2409
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:39,000
Isn't that?

2410
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Yeah, so yeah, so you have like a narco capitalism.

2411
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,500
You have a narco socialism, narco communism, syndicalism

2412
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:45,500
primitivism.

2413
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:49,500
You can definitely find a narco nationalism.

2414
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,000
Okay, so okay.

2415
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,900
I I just this is like that.

2416
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:55,600
Yeah, I'll give you the I'll give you the tldr.

2417
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:58,900
Okay, so yeah briefly because I don't want to get National

2418
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:04,400
National anarchists syncretize ethnic nationalism with philosophical

2419
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:07,200
anarchism in their support for a stateless society.

2420
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:11,700
So they they're against they don't want a state.

2421
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:14,900
They don't want a government but they do want a unified

2422
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:18,800
society based on some sort of tribal lines whether it's

2423
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:23,000
ethnic or racial or religious or something that unites

2424
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,700
them together with like a very strict in-group out-group

2425
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:29,700
view of the world, but there's no government and no state.

2426
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:35,100
Okay, you know why we can just label all of those things

2427
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:36,700
into the retarded category.

2428
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:40,100
Well, if you look at a lot of the people that left-wingers

2429
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:44,400
mistakenly call fascist nowadays, they do kind of line up

2430
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:47,700
with with an narco nationalist ideas, which is kind of fun

2431
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:49,200
because like like Nick Fuentes.

2432
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:51,300
He definitely applies as an narco nationalist.

2433
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:54,500
I can I can have based on that very brief description you've

2434
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,800
given he hits a lot of the boxes.

2435
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:02,400
It's it's it's one of those things where it sounds I wonder

2436
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:05,000
how many of people say that there are these things just

2437
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,300
to sound crazy or to sound different or to be unique or

2438
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:10,100
whatever right to be edgy.

2439
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:10,600
Yeah.

2440
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:14,200
I'm sure you've seen like Twitter accounts or they'll post

2441
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:18,600
like, you know this very specific type of this one leftist

2442
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,800
writer who's part of this one movement from some country

2443
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,300
70 years ago and that's the the specific strain of leftist

2444
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:28,400
thought I believe in and it's like we all know you're just

2445
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:30,500
you're just sitting around on your underwear eating fucking

2446
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:34,800
chicken tendies and watching YouTube streams of bread tubers

2447
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:38,400
and that's that's all you are true, but they got to make

2448
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:39,200
it sound good, right?

2449
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,100
Let's bring on the next contestant on whatever the fuck

2450
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:41,700
this is.

2451
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:50,400
Ali your life you are what a man what you got for us brother.

2452
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:51,600
All right.

2453
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:56,600
So I was wondering societally I've been watching and I feel

2454
02:10:56,600 --> 02:11:00,900
like things are going like more red pill blue pill, right?

2455
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:03,800
Have you seen elaborate on that?

2456
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,900
Yeah in terms of dating in terms of like ideology.

2457
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:10,300
It seems like a lot of young people are really responsive

2458
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:13,800
and they're really like hype to follow red pill ideology.

2459
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,400
So the sneakers the fresh and fits of the world and I feel

2460
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:20,600
like in that war that's happening that cultural war.

2461
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,900
The only reason they're winning is because they have something

2462
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:26,300
to offer or it like seems like they have something to offer.

2463
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:30,600
So in terms of like money bitches cars profits all that shit.

2464
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,600
That's what they have and the blue pill side has nothing

2465
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:33,300
to offer.

2466
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:36,800
So I feel like how do you combat that if you if you disagree

2467
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:40,500
with with the ideology that that works for young people

2468
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:42,900
specific is like specifically because if you're older you

2469
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:45,000
can see through the bullshit, but when you're young, it's

2470
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
really flashing you're like, ooh.

2471
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:50,500
Well, I think this is a problem that solves itself as you

2472
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:56,400
said it appeals to very young set demographic generally

2473
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,900
and I think experience is the wisest teacher right and

2474
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:04,800
I guess it's cyclical because every generation says this

2475
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:07,800
is like well, we know better than the generation that came

2476
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:10,500
before but I wish a generation that's coming after us would

2477
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:11,700
listen to our experience, right?

2478
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:13,200
So it's like a cyclical thing.

2479
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:17,800
I think this is just a combination of social media the

2480
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:22,400
incentives for that combined with like a noise amplification

2481
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:26,200
of these very specific ideologies.

2482
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:31,300
I I don't worry about it too much because I think that at

2483
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:36,400
the end of the day the because when you say red pill that's

2484
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:37,400
way too broad.

2485
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,000
There are some red pill ideas.

2486
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,700
I actually agree with well, I wanted to say conservative

2487
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:44,200
and liberal but it wasn't I don't know if it's necessarily

2488
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:46,400
that yeah again, that's way too broad.

2489
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:53,600
Again, because it we have we can't think of it as so binary

2490
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:56,600
as all that I think that there's a lot of people who are

2491
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:03,100
pointing to structural issues that men have in in culture,

2492
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:07,700
right in Western cultures and dating cultures that are just

2493
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:12,700
true, but then they'll try to sell you a false kind of fix

2494
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,100
and I think that what the blue pill could do quote-unquote

2495
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:19,500
is simply expose that and say now these they're lying to you

2496
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:23,800
and this is how and also we need better and I know this is

2497
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:28,800
maybe cliche to say but we need better role models on the

2498
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,300
more left-leaning spectrum that a don't get exposed as a sex

2499
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:36,300
pest. Okay, that's a big one that we're having a problem

2500
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:43,100
with for whatever reason and P they need to be able to show

2501
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:45,000
hate to be able to explain.

2502
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:49,200
Okay, you may be struggling now, but I promise after high

2503
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:51,700
school it gets better because I didn't get many bitches

2504
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:52,300
in high school.

2505
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:53,400
But look at me now.

2506
02:13:53,900 --> 02:13:55,800
Okay, I got my own YouTube channel.

2507
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:59,900
Are you getting tons of bitches now with look I'm swimming

2508
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:00,700
by the troll.

2509
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:01,900
Okay, moving me.

2510
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:03,800
Well here here.

2511
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,300
I'll jump in here, right?

2512
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:08,600
So on some level what you're describing is I think just

2513
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:13,700
impossible young people will always be attracted to radical

2514
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:16,700
ideologies is just a part of growing up and there's

2515
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:18,200
psychological reasons for this right?

2516
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:22,400
Like if you if you read like Piaget's work on developmental

2517
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:26,900
psychology, you realize that the experience of going through

2518
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:30,400
puberty and experience and you're just personally experience

2519
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:35,300
massive radical changes that are like half out of your control

2520
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:41,000
that experience tends to lead young people to also realize

2521
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,500
that a lot of society should also go through radical change

2522
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:49,100
so that they may fit into society right because they are

2523
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:51,100
different from the old paradigm.

2524
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:53,700
This is a very common thing that people go through when

2525
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:55,600
they're in their late teens in their early 20s.

2526
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:59,600
It's just it's a part of human psychology and generally after

2527
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:02,800
they go through this this phase of wanting to radically

2528
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:06,600
reorder the world sometimes they do actually end up having

2529
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:08,100
good ideas and how to reorder the world.

2530
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:09,600
Sometimes the ideas are bullshit.

2531
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:11,000
Sometimes they do reorder the world.

2532
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,400
Sometimes they don't but either way after this psychological

2533
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:15,400
period is done.

2534
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:19,700
They tend to be more amenable to fitting into what society

2535
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:21,400
is in reality.

2536
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:24,600
And that doesn't mean that older people can't enact change

2537
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:28,900
they can but but basically there we are psychologically primed

2538
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:35,000
to want to engage in revolution in in in let's say our early

2539
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:38,400
adult life and I guess that makes sense because if there

2540
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:41,600
was a change that needed to be made that's when we are young

2541
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:44,300
enough and strong enough and capable enough to to do it.

2542
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,100
So I guess it makes sense.

2543
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:47,400
It would happen then but also you lack the wisdom to be able

2544
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:47,900
to do it, right?

2545
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:53,200
So on some level you can't like outside ideologies red pill

2546
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:57,000
stuff socialism even fascism, whatever it is stuff that is

2547
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,600
not the current social norm that will always appeal to young

2548
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:01,100
people.

2549
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:06,800
It will always draw them in the only thing it was.

2550
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:07,100
Yes.

2551
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:07,600
Yes.

2552
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:13,000
So the only thing you can really do is to understand that

2553
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,300
a lot of young people will be doing this and that your society

2554
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:20,200
is properly structured that they have viable off-ramps to

2555
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:22,700
rejoin society when they're done with it, right?

2556
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:23,400
So it's like, okay.

2557
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:25,400
Yeah, you were LARPing as a revolutionary when you were in

2558
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:28,000
high school or when you were in college, but you have a

2559
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,700
college degree now and you can actually get a decent job

2560
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:33,200
and you can actually, you know, find a girlfriend and buy

2561
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,000
a house and become a regular member of society as long as

2562
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,300
society is structured to grant some leeway to people who

2563
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:43,700
are going through this phase and still provide them with

2564
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:47,900
ways to integrate into society and and frankly even take

2565
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:50,600
on some of their new ideas if they have if they happen to

2566
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:53,700
be worth some something as long as our society is set up

2567
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:57,500
like that, then they will naturally de-radicalize on their

2568
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:00,800
own. But if our society is not set up like that and there's

2569
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,700
some evidence it's not currently set up like that.

2570
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:05,600
That's when you start to have lifelong revolutionaries and

2571
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,600
you start to have massive social upheaval.

2572
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:10,500
And I think that's the current problem facing liberal democracies

2573
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:11,000
right now.

2574
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:13,400
Response.

2575
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:16,500
Okay understood.

2576
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,900
I was just saying I'm just saying it.

2577
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:22,100
So I from what I understood you feel so from what I got then

2578
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:23,900
the society is pretty liberal right now.

2579
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:26,200
So then the radical thing would be to go conservative and

2580
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:27,900
everyone's just going conservative and you think that'll

2581
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:30,500
even out in a little bit or you think that the conservatives

2582
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:34,000
offer the conservative conservative side actually offers

2583
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,500
something structural for people to like respond to it's both

2584
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:41,400
it's both right conservative critiques of liberalism.

2585
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:44,100
There there does seem to be a fair amount of meat on that

2586
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:44,600
bone.

2587
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:48,400
So it's not like they're just there's radical for the sake

2588
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:52,700
of being radical right, but as long as liberal society is

2589
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:55,300
capable of taking the good critiques and also taking the

2590
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:57,600
people that believe them those people will naturally

2591
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:58,900
de-radicalize right.

2592
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:01,300
So I guess the issue like for example, you look at like

2593
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:04,700
people who follow and Andrew Tate as a good example, right

2594
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:07,400
and like there are young boys who are who are now, you know

2595
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:10,900
devaluing women and and chasing money and you know, they're

2596
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:13,300
not be like they're being alpha males, but they're not

2597
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:15,900
being positive examples of what an alpha male should be

2598
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:16,400
right.

2599
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,000
That's that's big.

2600
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,200
Yeah.

2601
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:19,800
Yeah that too.

2602
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:22,200
But like it like you can't deny that Andrew Tate's an alpha

2603
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,400
male, but he's a very negative alpha male if that makes sense,

2604
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:24,800
right?

2605
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,300
So you have you have young guys that are that are looking

2606
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:33,400
at that situation and in an ideal society, they would meet

2607
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:39,100
maybe a decent woman who would be kind and interested in them

2608
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:41,500
as long as they themselves were of course able to attract

2609
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:44,500
her and then maybe they would have a real relationship and

2610
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:47,000
he would realize that, you know, the scales would fall from

2611
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,600
his eyes and he would realize oh my God.

2612
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:51,100
I've believed completely wrong things about women this

2613
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:55,000
whole time because you know having having a propagandist

2614
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,800
tell you for years what women's true nature actually is

2615
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:00,000
and then when you finally fucking meet one for the first

2616
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,900
time, you know, the reality of it isn't doesn't stand up

2617
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:07,400
to to the propaganda right, but if it's now harder to meet

2618
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:11,500
women and it is and let's say the the ways in which you

2619
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:15,000
would traditionally meet women it's now become more taboo

2620
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,700
to do like at work or at the gym or at the store and it

2621
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:21,600
is and maybe some of the ways in which you might meet a

2622
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:25,800
woman which is you know on an app the types of women who

2623
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:29,700
are on those apps they reinforce negative stereotypes of

2624
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:32,100
women rather than dispelling them and that also seems to

2625
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:36,700
be somewhat the case now you have like a cauldron where

2626
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:38,900
radicalization is only going to continue and there's no

2627
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:39,900
real off-ramp.

2628
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,800
It's just going it's just going to bubble up and continue

2629
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:46,100
to cook and so like it's funny because you see like a

2630
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:50,000
lot of let's say to be to be not so kind right-wing schizos

2631
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
on Twitter who desperately want the trad wife, but none

2632
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,500
of them are going to church right?

2633
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:57,400
None of them are going to church to meet any of the girls

2634
02:19:57,400 --> 02:19:59,100
because those girls do exist there right?

2635
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,800
None of them are at University instead of partying.

2636
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:04,100
They're in the library.

2637
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:06,700
They don't even want them realistically they can claim

2638
02:20:06,700 --> 02:20:08,500
that they want them but the end of the day they really

2639
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:10,900
want they want the hose that they claim that to hate.

2640
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:13,300
So it's just like it's the same thing with the Muslim

2641
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:15,700
if they want the four wives, but none of the people that

2642
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:18,200
none of the girls dads are going to approve of that marriage

2643
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:20,000
anyways to those people because you're not good enough

2644
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:20,700
for that girl.

2645
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:24,500
Yeah, it's a you're correct dev when you say that there's

2646
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:25,900
like this kind of storm brewing.

2647
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:30,400
We haven't really learned to deal with the new reality

2648
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:31,400
that we are in right?

2649
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:35,400
We haven't learned as a culture how to respond to and I

2650
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:38,000
hate to use this canard, but the social media problem

2651
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:40,200
and it is a problem and it's going to be something

2652
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:43,000
that we're going to have to figure out rules of the road

2653
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,100
for right figure out ways to handle it and to adjust

2654
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:51,400
to everything being everywhere all at once and I think

2655
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:55,400
that one of the things that's going to have to happen

2656
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:59,100
are a lot of these things that have become denormalized

2657
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:02,900
or stigmatized such as meeting people or talking to people

2658
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:07,600
at the grocery store or the gym right approaching people

2659
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,900
right that needs to become okay again.

2660
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:12,200
It used to be okay back in my day.

2661
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:14,200
It was okay, right when I was in my 20th.

2662
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:15,300
You just go up.

2663
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:16,500
Hey, I think you're cute.

2664
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,900
You want to go get a coffee sometime sometimes be polite

2665
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:19,200
about it.

2666
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:19,400
Now.

2667
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:20,700
Sometimes it'd be mean about it.

2668
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:22,300
Sometimes they'd agree to it, right?

2669
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:23,300
It really depended.

2670
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:30,600
We need to we need to stop stigmatizing that and the adults

2671
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:33,000
need to step up and say hey kids.

2672
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,400
I know sometimes when someone approaches you with something

2673
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:37,200
you don't like it can make you uncomfortable,

2674
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,400
but that doesn't make them a bad person that doesn't mean

2675
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:41,200
they're out to get you that doesn't mean they've harmed

2676
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,000
you in any way.

2677
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:45,100
You can simply learn how to say no and her learn how to

2678
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:49,600
be assertive rather than weaponize your mental mental

2679
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,900
instability and weaponize your social problems and sort

2680
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:58,800
of an inability to be able to communicate and say that

2681
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:01,400
oh, well, they're the bad guy because they're asking me

2682
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:02,800
a fucking normal question.

2683
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,100
I don't know anything else for us Ali.

2684
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:08,700
No, just back to my original point is just that doesn't

2685
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:11,500
sound as nice and glamorous as just do this and you'll

2686
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:12,700
get the you'll fuck bitches.

2687
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:16,200
Yeah, the marketing's got to change up.

2688
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:17,000
But thank you, man.

2689
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:23,300
What do you think of that social media take though?

2690
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:24,600
I'm really curious.

2691
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:28,500
I think that most of the problems we have today can be laid

2692
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:32,800
at the feet in one way or another of social media specifically.

2693
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:37,300
I mean when I was younger social media basically existed

2694
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:40,700
to help facilitate offline stuff.

2695
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,500
You get in touch with people so that you can go to a party

2696
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:46,400
together or that you could it was it was a tool but it wasn't

2697
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:47,300
your entire life.

2698
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,200
Now social media is people's entire lives and that's bad

2699
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:54,400
unless you're watching me on social media gang in which

2700
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:57,600

You can try my conversations.

2703

But yeah, listen, listen, if you super chat you can get

2704
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:07,900

2705

be your real life friend Roo.

2706
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:13,600
Hey with enough money anything is possible friends anything

2707
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:14,000
at all.

2708
02:23:14,500 --> 02:23:16,300
Let me bring on the next contestant.

2709
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:18,600
What you got for us?

2710
02:23:22,300 --> 02:23:23,200
Gentlemen.

2711
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:25,200
Hello.

2712
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:26,600
Hi, you're live.

2713
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:30,900
Oh first and foremost, I've been listening for pretty much

2714
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:31,400
the whole time.

2715
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:32,200
So there's a lot of stuff.

2716
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:35,100
I kind of want to go back first back to you guys is like

2717
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:36,000
three guests ago.

2718
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:39,600
You were having a unilateral disarmament argument about

2719
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:42,800
how one side does something the other side is either forced

2720
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:47,600
to or unilaterally disarming and wick said we live in a

2721
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:50,700
liberal democracy where you can go and say we're the side

2722
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:52,900
with morals and an ideal world.

2723
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:54,400
Thank you are a hundred percent, right?

2724
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:57,200
I wish we lived in that world but in reality we live in

2725
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:00,500
a very partisan atmosphere where you can tell your side

2726
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:03,100
where the moral people while also going out and being the

2727
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:06,500
scumbag and your side will find small reasons to stand

2728
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:09,700
up for you and damn the other side for very very similar

2729
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:10,400
actions.

2730
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:13,100
So unfortunately practically that doesn't work out as well

2731
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:13,900
as I'd hope.

2732
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:17,100
Oh, it's not a it's not like it's not a panacea.

2733
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,900
It's not a bomb of Gilead that will heal all our wounds,

2734
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:20,400
right?

2735
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:26,400
But in the long term like playing the long game over several

2736
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:32,100
iterations of elections of news cycles Etc.

2737
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:35,800
I stand by this it works.

2738
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:40,900
There is a reason that we swung leftward after the 90s,

2739
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:44,900
right after the 80s and 90s where people saw that the right

2740
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:47,800
wing was full of shit on their free speech like they would

2741
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:52,500
ban books and all these things anti freedom anti video game

2742
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:54,900
and to all these things right the anti fun party.

2743
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:59,900
We took the wrong lessons from that and we think well,

2744
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:01,300
that's when they had power.

2745
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:03,400
This is what they were doing when they had power.

2746
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:04,900
So it must be what works.

2747
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,700
So the left started adopting shit like that.

2748
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:11,800
Oh, yeah, that's a wrong lesson because that's that I would

2749
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:16,300
pause it is why they lost power and again a more liberalizing

2750
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:19,400
society more liberalizing culture and over the years we

2751
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:20,400
have been more liberalizing.

2752
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,400
So yes, you won't win every election.

2753
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:23,900
You may not win the next election.

2754
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,400
But again over a long enough period of time over several

2755
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:30,300
iterations, you will win if you stick to it if you can message

2756
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:33,400
control enough if you can again, there's a lot of ifs here.

2757
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:34,600
It's not a perfect thing.

2758
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:37,800
But if you can message control enough if you can take control

2759
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:41,700
of enough of your of your party of your ideology of your

2760
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:45,800
apparatus, whatever you want to call it and kind of say hey,

2761
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:46,900
these are our values.

2762
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:48,600
We don't fuck with our values.

2763
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:52,100
Even if it's politically expedient to do so no one's

2764
02:25:52,100 --> 02:25:53,000
actually doing that.

2765
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,200
So it's probably yeah.

2766
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:55,600
I just didn't want to rehash the whole thing.

2767
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:57,100
I just kind of wanted to throw that point in there because

2768
02:25:57,100 --> 02:26:00,000
I thought about it like you are correct technically, but

2769
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,800
unfortunately practically doesn't work out as much like

2770
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:05,600
that as I hope the next point is dev was talking about how

2771
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,900
an inherent trait of fascism is an autocratic leader and

2772
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:13,600
looking at some of the ideals of fascism you can almost

2773
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:18,800
Implement or theory craft a way to have democratic fascism

2774
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:21,400
where you wouldn't have that one autocratic central figure

2775
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:24,800
that the government lives and dies by I'm not endorsing it

2776
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:25,200
or anything.

2777
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:29,500
I'm just saying I could envision a retelling of fascism to

2778
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:34,700
be more of a congressional or parliamentary government as

2779
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:36,000
opposed to an autocratic one.

2780
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,500
Well, I mean Mussolini already did that right with the Grand

2781
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:40,500
Council of fascism.

2782
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:40,900
Yeah.

2783
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:41,400
Yeah.

2784
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:44,500
I'm so basically like fascinated.

2785
02:26:44,900 --> 02:26:50,700
Well, what basically what it was was in Italy any Italian

2786
02:26:50,700 --> 02:26:55,200
citizen could join the fascist party and then get elected

2787
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:59,600
to the Grand Council of fascism right now wasn't like it

2788
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:04,000
was a democracy and that people voted but it was not a democracy

2789
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,700
because it was a one-party democracy right like you had multiple

2790
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:10,900
different strains of fascism that were competing but no one

2791
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:13,100
who is not a fascist could be in the government if that

2792
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:13,900
makes sense, right?

2793
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,000
So like it was it was kind of democratic right, but but it's

2794
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:23,300
still ultimately all of that like under structure still ultimately

2795
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:26,400
hinged on Mussolini being in control of everything and once

2796
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:29,400
Mussolini was gone the entire thing collapsed to you.

2797
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:32,800
I agree with you a hundred percent but like the he in a sense

2798
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:35,300
it's because they're going through the change still once

2799
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:37,800
you have that government established and you have that machine

2800
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,000
well-oiled enough to sustain on its own it might take a couple

2801
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,800
of decades, but I could see I'm just saying hypothetically

2802
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:46,700
I'd see a version of fascism that isn't Central the Rock centralized

2803
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:49,700
around one person in the state that it actually worked in which

2804
02:27:49,700 --> 02:27:53,000
I could argue that like, you know, like South Korea kind of

2805
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,100
did you mean North Korea or no South Korea wasn't the where

2806
02:27:58,100 --> 02:28:00,800
they considered one of the seven fascist governments in the

2807
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:01,800
world at one point.

2808
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:04,000
I don't think so.

2809
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:04,400
Look it up.

2810
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,300
Might be true.

2811
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:06,700
I don't have to read the book.

2812
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:07,200
Let me see.

2813
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:07,800
Let me see.

2814
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:13,500
I know like Portugal and Spain were Romania Germany Italy

2815
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:14,100
Japan.

2816
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:21,100
I mean South Korea and and Taiwan both had nationalist governments

2817
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:25,300
in the face of of like their like the socialist parties taking

2818
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:28,600
over in Japan North Korea and then in China, right and they

2819
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:30,900
had nationalist governments that eventually transitioned into

2820
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:31,900
liberal democracies.

2821
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,500
But were they fascist?

2822
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:36,200
I'm not sure maybe it's possible.

2823
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:38,000
I have to check the reference.

2824
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:39,400
They weren't fascist.

2825
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:42,700
It was a nationalist saying like I forget the guy's name, right

2826
02:28:42,700 --> 02:28:46,200
there their leader whatever they got kicked out.

2827
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,400
They lost the war and they got kicked out to Taiwan to kind

2828
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:50,300
of like as a last bastion and stuff.

2829
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:55,600
But yeah, that kind of went away as well after the leadership

2830
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,100
died. So yeah, so those were just two honorable mentions.

2831
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:00,700
I wanted to my main point.

2832
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,400
My main point is that we don't really have conservatism in

2833
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:04,500
the United States anymore.

2834
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:07,500
We have newer versions of liberalism versus older versions

2835
02:29:07,500 --> 02:29:08,300
of liberalism.

2836
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:11,400
If you look at a lot of the history behind the libertarian

2837
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:13,800
movement, this would go back to like the Mises Institute

2838
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:14,800
writings and such.

2839
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:16,900
I like Tom Woods if anyone's ever heard of him.

2840
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:20,500
He's a really educated libertarian libertarians left the

2841
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:23,600
Democratic Party around the time of World War Two because

2842
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:28,200
they saw FDR as too autocratic of a leader for their ideals

2843
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:31,400
and they slowly drifted to the right wing and the right wing

2844
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:33,600
kind of has an idea of respect for institutions.

2845
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:38,100
So they cut out their own anti-government quarter of the

2846
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:40,300
right wing that actually kind of became a staple of the party

2847
02:29:40,300 --> 02:29:43,600
now. If you look at the inception of the Neocons, Neocons

2848
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:46,300
were liberal Democrats for a long time.

2849
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:50,500
They shifted away from the party when who was it Reagan?

2850
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:52,600
I think they the first time they voted right wing was for

2851
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:57,100
Reagan. And so they shifted into more of it was actually

2852
02:29:57,100 --> 02:29:59,000
meant as a pejorative and same thing with neoliberal.

2853
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,700
These terms were originally pejorative and became the names

2854
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:04,100
of these movements because they were people that switch

2855
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:07,000
sides when the Democratic Party went a different way like

2856
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,300
I said during that discussion.

2857
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:10,900
I think they're still pejorative, right?

2858
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:14,800
You know, you don't say neoliberal or neoconservative in

2859
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:15,900
a positive sense.

2860
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:17,400
I've never heard that right?

2861
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:21,700
Yeah, I mean neoconservative is how like John Pott Horitz

2862
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:23,000
at the commentary magazine.

2863
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:25,300
His dad was one of the founders of the neoconservative

2864
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:27,700
movement. He uses that term as endearment.

2865
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:29,000
He's proud of it.

2866
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,600
He just wrote a few months ago.

2867
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:31,800
That's the exception.

2868
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:36,100
And it doesn't doesn't Francis Fukuyama use neoliberal

2869
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:37,000
positively too?

2870
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:39,700
I think they're used positively a little bit. Fukuyama ended

2871
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:41,300
history. He can do what the fuck he wants.

2872
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:42,100
Okay, right.

2873
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:46,000
liberal happily like I'm pretty pro-interventionist and

2874
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,900
such so I would consider myself a neoliberal because I have

2875
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:52,300
the core values of liberalism, but I also support that.

2876
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:54,300
Uh, what's the word?

2877
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:56,000
It's not meritocracy.

2878
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,400
It's a fuck.

2879
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:02,100
Technocracy the technocratic the status that the current

2880
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:05,600
Democratic Party holds where they have a democratic elite

2881
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,600
ruling elite, but they're made up of professionals that earn

2882
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:09,500
their way there through merit.

2883
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:11,900
Are you part of the only my friend?

2884
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:15,100
No, no, I just support the fact that we need I'm a big about

2885
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:19,500
specialization and think are you are you in the car?

2886
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:21,100
That's what it sounds like.

2887
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:22,100
He's like he's in a car.

2888
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:24,100
Are you being are you okay?

2889
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:29,900
Oh, come on Easter has camera.

2890
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:32,100
I don't look I'm worried.

2891
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:35,100
I'm concerned the camera is loading up.

2892
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:38,600
I can't hear them either.

2893
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:40,700
Can I okay buddy?

2894
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:42,700
Well, thank you.

2895
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:44,300
Thank you for calling in.

2896
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:47,300
I wish he has gone to an accident.

2897
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:47,800
Maybe more.

2898
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:48,700
I hope not.

2899
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:49,600
I hope he's okay.

2900
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,100
That would be a feel really bad.

2901
02:31:52,100 --> 02:31:53,600
But I'm sending him to the way for now.

2902
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,500
Um, I'm being told me think about let me think about that

2903
02:31:57,500 --> 02:31:58,000
for a minute.

2904
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:58,800
What do you just said?

2905
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:02,000
It's like I mean, he said like he might have been like an

2906
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:08,600
NRX or something maybe but but I don't know I like what he

2907
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:12,100
was saying was technically true like America's Republicans

2908
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:14,600
are like older with with the exception of the Trump faction,

2909
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:17,200
which is something new but like Americans Republicans before

2910
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:20,500
Trump were like older liberals and then the Democrats were

2911
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:24,500
like newer liberals if that makes sense like conservatism

2912
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:28,500
as an ideology is just whatever the status quo is and so

2913
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:32,400
for America because classical liberalism is the status quo

2914
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:34,600
your conservatives are classical liberals, right?

2915
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:36,500
However, if you if you're a conservative in the United

2916
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:39,300
Kingdom, you're a monarchist which is different.

2917
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:42,800
So I think it might be a little more nuanced than that.

2918
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:43,200
Right?

2919
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:45,900
I think that there are things such as conservative values.

2920
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:51,700
I think that transcend the status quo, but I haven't thought

2921
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:54,800
enough about it to really give it an educated kind of take

2922
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:55,100
on it.

2923
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:57,500
But this is just my instinct to be clear.

2924
02:32:58,300 --> 02:33:03,200
I think that look at the end of the day.

2925
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:08,700
I think that there are more people today at least that vote

2926
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:13,700
against things and they are that vote for so there is a lot

2927
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:18,300
of people who are anti insert whatever here anti-right-wing

2928
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:20,300
anti-left-wing and that's how they vote now.

2929
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:23,900
They don't really vote for positive things anymore, but

2930
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:24,800
that's just my instinct.

2931
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:26,200
I don't have a point.

2932
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:30,800
Not me that sounds about right to be like in retrospect.

2933
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:34,600
I'm actually quite certain that the main reason Trump won

2934
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:39,100
in 2016 is not because he was actually considered a better

2935
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:42,900
candidate is that people really did not like Hillary Clinton.

2936
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,400
Well, they did not like the status quo.

2937
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:46,800
They didn't like that too.

2938
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:51,300
The it was a I think Michael Moore described it as a firebomb

2939
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:53,400
into the electorate right like that.

2940
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:56,300
A lot of people just wanted to change shit.

2941
02:33:56,400 --> 02:33:59,800
That's why Bernie got close to Bernie Rose to National

2942
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:03,400
Promise prominence, even though he was a politician for decades,

2943
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:03,800
right?

2944
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:10,300
He ran the reason he became kind of like this cause celeb

2945
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:14,900
for a lot of people is a lot of people just do not like how

2946
02:34:14,900 --> 02:34:15,900
politics are right now.

2947
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:19,800
They hate it trust in our institutions is dipping.

2948
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:23,100
It's it's going lower and lower and lower every year.

2949
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:28,500
They're perfectly valid reasons for that and there's some

2950
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:31,400
some more silly reasons for that right?

2951
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:35,000
It's beyond the scope of this discussion, but I think that

2952
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,700
like the Venn diagram between Bernie voters and Trump voters

2953
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:43,900
is bigger than you think for that reason is because both

2954
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:48,100
candidates are seen as a fuck you to Washington, right?

2955
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:50,500
There's a fuck you to the establishment.

2956
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:54,100
So there's a lot of other things would have voted for Bernie

2957
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:54,900
instead, right?

2958
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:58,900
The main reason why I think Biden won in 2020 is because

2959
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:01,600
after the fuck you vote, you know, we're not going to just

2960
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,900
accept Hillary versus Jeb and no matter what happens.

2961
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:07,100
We're you know, we get the same thing just with different

2962
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:09,900
colors on it and we are going to choose something outside

2963
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:12,400
the paradigm and they chose Trump and they had four years

2964
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:16,000
of that and a lot of people I think realized oh shit at least

2965
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,900
what's out outside the paradigm in this this instance was

2966
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:20,200
really fucking bad.

2967
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:23,400
Yeah, maybe the paradigm hat is it has a reason to exist.

2968
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:26,400
So I think that's why things swung back in 2020.

2969
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:27,300
Yeah, they realize.

2970
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:30,300
Oh, no, we wanted change but not this change gang.

2971
02:35:30,300 --> 02:35:32,800
Please help and no, I think you're right.

2972
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:34,900
Let's let's get through as many people as possible.

2973
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:36,200
We only got a little bit of time left.

2974
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:40,500
So we're going to rapid-fire these extra high.

2975
02:35:43,700 --> 02:35:46,600
Well, good evening gentlemen me howdy.

2976
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:47,100
What's up?

2977
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Well, first of all Dev.

2978
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,200
Thanks so much for staying some extra time.

2979
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:56,600
I'm on the west coast over here and I just got off work.

2980
02:35:56,600 --> 02:36:01,700
So happy to have a chance to come in and say hello and second

2981
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:04,300
of all there's a hundred and six people watching now on YouTube

2982
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:06,300
and there are 16 likes what is wrong with you?

2983
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:07,500
Get on.

2984
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:10,000
I don't know why people don't like my shit like this is a

2985
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,800
thing. This is not new to my experience.

2986
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:16,000
You sound defeated wick.

2987
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,000
I am defeated.

2988
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I've tried different things to get people to click that

2989
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:25,400
goddamn like button, but for whatever reason they I'm stymied,

2990
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:26,200
but it's okay.

2991
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:29,000
They still watch and I still I still get five dollars from

2992
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,400
Artemis Fowl for to say then explain the current swing back

2993
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:32,500
in favor of Trump Dev.

2994
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:33,700
Don't worry.

2995
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:41,100
We'll talk more Artemis, but yeah, but anyway, what do you

2996
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:44,600
got to say enough glossing me and love glazing dev here.

2997
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:45,700
You can suck our dicks later.

2998
02:36:45,900 --> 02:36:47,300
But for now tell us why you're here.

2999
02:36:48,300 --> 02:36:52,300
Well, I think I like we're all we're all about changing our

3000
02:36:52,300 --> 02:36:54,400
minds here in the in the wick chat.

3001
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:59,600
So I'd like to see if I can push dev a little bit about

3002
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:03,200
changing his mind when it comes to the idea that you need

3003
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:07,700
to censor in like teach a lesson so that then others know

3004
02:37:07,700 --> 02:37:09,700
what it was like to be censored in the first place.

3005
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:12,300
There was a few callers back now, but I'd like to push

3006
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:12,700
you out of that.

3007
02:37:12,700 --> 02:37:13,200
All right.

3008
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,100
Okay, go ahead.

3009
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:18,700
I don't know first of all if that can apply to populations

3010
02:37:18,700 --> 02:37:21,800
rather than like single individuals, right?

3011
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:24,600
I can teach somebody that what they did was wrong by doing

3012
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:26,600
it to them and like having them experience it.

3013
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:30,100
But if I as a singular actor as a part of the left have

3014
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:33,100
never done anything to censor and then get censored as a

3015
02:37:33,100 --> 02:37:36,400
retaliatory act then I have only all you've ever done there

3016
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:39,700
is create another victim somebody who already now hates

3017
02:37:39,700 --> 02:37:42,400
the other side once again and you continue that cycle of

3018
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:43,900
hatred. So what are your thoughts on that?

3019
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:45,700
I mean, I agree.

3020
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:48,300
Yes, you do have to do it on an individual level, right?

3021
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:52,000
So for example, if you look at the people the reason we had

3022
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,700
this conversation initially was because there were prominent

3023
02:37:54,700 --> 02:37:57,800
left-wing Twitter accounts getting banned one of them was

3024
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:01,500
that fucking squirrel person who's like ridiculous, right?

3025
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:04,200
They have done their share of censoring and now that they

3026
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:06,800
are being censored as like, okay, maybe you can learn your

3027
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:07,600
lesson, right?

3028
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:10,700
You shouldn't just censor people who haven't done any censoring

3029
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:12,400
even if they're aligned with other sensors.

3030
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:12,800
That's true.

3031
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:13,200
Yes.

3032
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,200
Okay, and then secondly they mentioned something about

3033
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,500
going back to war games and that there's no winning move

3034
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:25,900
in a war game and I'm sure being people of the internet.

3035
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:27,800
We're all familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma.

3036
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:31,200
There's a couple weeks ago now a Veritasium video about

3037
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:34,700
it and the Prisoner's Dilemma has winning outcomes.

3038
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:39,800
The first initial winning move is a tit-for-tat where you

3039
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:43,700
only reply in kind to any offense that's done to you.

3040
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:44,700
Yeah, I saw this video.

3041
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:45,400
Yeah, I know you're talking about.

3042
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:48,300
Yeah, and then but generous does better than that right

3043
02:38:48,300 --> 02:38:51,400
occasionally giving back in and saying okay this time.

3044
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:53,700
I'm not going to attack back even though you did to me that

3045
02:38:53,700 --> 02:38:54,500
does even better.

3046
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:56,900
So do you have any argument against that?

3047
02:38:57,900 --> 02:39:01,600
So not not really because it does seem to be pretty much

3048
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:05,300
true, but even in generous there is a point where you must

3049
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:08,300
strike back and you cannot simply take it and take it and

3050
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:12,600
take it and take it eternally and then do nothing right like

3051
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:16,500
even it within generous like if you could take it eternally

3052
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:23,300
if you I think even for the generous the generous algorithm

3053
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:26,400
if it was faced with an algorithm that would simply attack

3054
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:29,900
it relentlessly without any without changing a strategy

3055
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:30,200
at all.

3056
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:32,900
It would still attack back like it wouldn't it was it was

3057
02:39:32,900 --> 02:39:34,400
not eternally generous, right?

3058
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:37,300
So there's there has to there has to be some limit where

3059
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:39,300
you say, you know what, you know, I've given you a few

3060
02:39:39,300 --> 02:39:39,800
chances.

3061
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:42,300
I've forgiven you a few times now you do actually have to

3062
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:45,600
be hit back like you can't you there's no there's no pacifist

3063
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:46,500
option here basically.

3064
02:39:48,100 --> 02:39:48,600
All right.

3065
02:39:49,100 --> 02:39:50,300
Well, that's everything I had for you guys.

3066
02:39:50,300 --> 02:39:51,200
I appreciate you so much.

3067
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,800
We're doing we're doing rapid-fire gang.

3068
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:54,200
So extra thank you for calling in.

3069
02:39:56,900 --> 02:39:58,900
Well, I see so yattle in the chat.

3070
02:39:59,100 --> 02:40:01,400
I've seen is so yattle following me around.

3071
02:40:01,400 --> 02:40:03,800
He's always in like things that I'm on viewer.

3072
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:05,000
I don't know what to tell you.

3073
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:11,000
Yeah, he's been on my show to write like okay here to bring

3074
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,000
up the Forbidden Topic.

3075
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
I was on food shops a stream and he was there too.

3076
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,600
So I'm just like is it is he following me?

3077
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:18,900
Is that what's going on?

3078
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:21,700
He might be I mean that could be true.

3079
02:40:21,700 --> 02:40:24,200
He could be a wick viewer and following you at the same

3080
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:25,000
time stalking you.

3081
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:28,800
I don't know but so yattle is just a nice enough guy.

3082
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:32,600
Let me bring on Tom Jones your life.

3083
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:37,700
Hello.

3084
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:38,600
Hi.

3085
02:40:38,600 --> 02:40:39,000
Hello.

3086
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:41,700
Oh, this is exciting.

3087
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,700
This is rapid-fire.

3088
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:44,700
So let's uh, what you got?

3089
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:46,900
I just say a big fan of you dev.

3090
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:48,300
Anyway, so thank you.

3091
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:54,500
Should be very only recent discovered you like but you seem

3092
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:56,800
cool to you know, I'll give you that so it's quite the

3093
02:40:56,800 --> 02:40:57,700
question could be very broad.

3094
02:40:57,700 --> 02:40:58,900
I'll try to keep it narrow.

3095
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:02,300
So in society today, we've become increasingly secular,

3096
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:06,900
you know non belief in religion is on the rise and I want

3097
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,700
know if you guys think that is the problem considering,

3098
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:11,600
you know, pretty much every society throughout history

3099
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:13,300
has been very religious.

3100
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:17,800
What do you think wick?

3101
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:20,900
I'm gonna be real.

3102
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:21,900
I didn't hear the question.

3103
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:23,300
I was looking at the DM.

3104
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:28,500
Oh, it was it was about people becoming less religious over

3105
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:31,900
time. And if it's a bad thing, I think that it's had some

3106
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:33,300
negative consequences.

3107
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:34,300
I don't know overall.

3108
02:41:34,300 --> 02:41:34,900
It's bad.

3109
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:38,400
Like I hear all the time about people lacking community

3110
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:40,100
about people being more atomized.

3111
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:45,700
I think that the going away from being religious is partly

3112
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:46,700
to blame for that.

3113
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:50,200
We used to meet every Sunday in a house of worship at least

3114
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:54,500
in America, right less and less people are doing that and

3115
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:59,100
I think that has made it has had some negative consequences.

3116
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:01,400
I think that regardless of what you believe in the truth

3117
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:02,300
of religion.

3118
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:08,300
The communal aspect of it is helpful in a lot of ways not

3119
02:42:08,300 --> 02:42:11,500
always there are some negatives to that too, but I think

3120
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:17,400
that a lot of people are seeing the reverberations of this

3121
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:22,000
destruction of communities and partly that sounds about right.

3122
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Yeah religion.

3123
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:28,500
So do you think is anything that atheists or more secular

3124
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:32,300
people can do to try and retake that concept of community?

3125
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:33,500
Yes.

3126
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:41,000
Get off get offline, right and start actually meeting

3127
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:45,400
in person right a lot of the times what this would look

3128
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:49,100
like in non-religious circles is going to like Community

3129
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:53,000
Act activists stuff right like being involved in your community

3130
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:55,500
to make it better in other ways.

3131
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:59,300
Well another another benefit that religion had was the charity

3132
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:02,300
work. It did I remember being a young Mormon growing up

3133
02:43:02,300 --> 02:43:05,700
and I would go every summer right we would go and we would

3134
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:09,200
do hurricane relief things and we would go as a church like

3135
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:12,600
as a youth group to go clean up the community centers, right

3136
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:16,200
or clean up the parks or volunteer nursing homes Etc.

3137
02:43:17,300 --> 02:43:21,000
More of that without the religion would be grand.

3138
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:26,300
And so I think that yes a lot of people can we need to we

3139
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:30,500
need to incentivize people doing good for goodness sake

3140
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:36,400
right rather than doing good if it'll get me likes and updo's

3141
02:43:36,400 --> 02:43:37,300
on social media.

3142
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:41,200
Yeah, I mean atheists have a rough time with this because

3143
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:44,700
at least if you have God then you have a commandment to

3144
02:43:44,700 --> 02:43:48,000
do it right there's some sort of universal moral force

3145
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:52,400
that applies to everyone objectively and you can't really

3146
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:54,800
argue against that because it's the ultimate moral arbiter

3147
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:56,800
right but with a see a thesis that doesn't exist.

3148
02:43:57,100 --> 02:44:01,900
So it's it's much harder to to get atheists to do some

3149
02:44:01,900 --> 02:44:05,400
sort of community building without without that that moral

3150
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:06,200
force behind them.

3151
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,600
Anything else before we let you go?

3152
02:44:10,400 --> 02:44:11,700
That's all thank you.

3153
02:44:11,700 --> 02:44:14,000
I appreciate you guys and have a good rest of your night.

3154
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:14,600
Bye.

3155
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:15,200
Thank you again.

3156
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:15,600
Thanks, man.

3157
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:20,000
$15 from pondering politics who's blowing up on YouTube

3158
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:24,400
right away to say yes, he's getting more views than I I

3159
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:26,700
remember when I was a big boy, right and I was inviting

3160
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:28,200
him on my platform like hike it.

3161
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:32,500
I got 5,000 subscribers and now he's got like what 80,000

3162
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:33,000
or some shit.

3163
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:35,600
He's got a hundred and seven thousand.

3164
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:36,900
Yeah, it's blowing up.

3165
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:39,100
Like I said, so he's a he's doing well.

3166
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:41,600
Oh, this is this is ruminate, right?

3167
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:42,900
This is Josiah.

3168
02:44:43,100 --> 02:44:45,100
Well, I think you've talked to Josiah before have you?

3169
02:44:47,100 --> 02:44:48,300
Change his name from ruminate.

3170
02:44:48,500 --> 02:44:48,800
Yes.

3171
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:49,200
I think so.

3172
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:49,800
Yeah ruminate.

3173
02:44:49,800 --> 02:44:50,000
Yes.

3174
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:50,300
Yes.

3175
02:44:50,300 --> 02:44:52,200
This is running ask.

3176
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:55,500
I've I've I've spoken to him a little bit but only privately

3177
02:44:55,500 --> 02:45:00,700
and primarily knowing him as ruminate now ask SFO to weigh

3178
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:03,500
in on Trump's legal argument today that he's entitled to

3179
02:45:03,500 --> 02:45:04,800
absolute legal immunity.

3180
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,300
Even if he murders a political rival.

3181
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:08,700
That's ridiculous.

3182
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:10,900
Obviously, what is your favorite TV show?

3183
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:12,900
Have you seen the memes by the way?

3184
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:17,900
I saw this guy make an AI generation of Biden a seal team

3185
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:20,200
six assassinating a dude like shooting a gun.

3186
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:22,400
Yeah, so I think I saw the meme.

3187
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:25,700
Yeah, it was hilarious, right?

3188
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:30,300
Because that's the that's the kind of that's where that

3189
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:35,100
leads right if you think it's okay for a political person

3190
02:45:35,300 --> 02:45:38,700
to kill their political rivals or order a hit on that.

3191
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:41,700
That's that's what's going to happen, right?

3192
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:43,300
And I it's not a world.

3193
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:46,000
I want to live in so it looks like roommate you're doing

3194
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:50,000
like the the daily, you know political take you know, not

3195
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,500
I'm not comparing you to this person because for any moral

3196
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:56,000
reason it's just a similar type of content like like the

3197
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,200
quartering right where you put out a video or like two videos

3198
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,100
a day and you just like kind of flood the algorithm with

3199
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:04,100
daily content and it's working out for you.

3200
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:04,700
Good job, man.

3201
02:46:04,900 --> 02:46:05,800
I'm looking at your channel now.

3202
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:09,800
Yeah, like yeah, he's a small video.

3203
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:10,700
S is small video.

3204
02:46:10,700 --> 02:46:12,100
S is there like a definitely way to go?

3205
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:14,200
I was doing it for a while and I got too fucking lazy.

3206
02:46:15,400 --> 02:46:17,000
I've been too lazy recently, right?

3207
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:22,100
That's my problem is as I enjoy doing this because I get

3208
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:26,300
to interact in a long form with people and to to send that

3209
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:28,500
like 10 minutes snippets.

3210
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:28,900
I don't know.

3211
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,200
Yeah, well, I mean I did it for a while and I want to get

3212
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:35,100
back to it.

3213
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:38,400
I am 99% after watching destiny go through the meth stony

3214
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:41,900
arc with with the the ADHD medication.

3215
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:47,200
I am like knowing knowing my own my own issues.

3216
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,600
I am like I'm very convinced.

3217
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:52,200
I probably have some form of adult ADHD and I should probably

3218
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:54,100
try out I should probably try out.

3219
02:46:54,100 --> 02:46:55,100
What do you got himself on?

3220
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:58,000
Not simply like well, here's the thing where you see it a

3221
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,900
lot and then suddenly you start having the symptoms because

3222
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:03,800
that's all you ever looking at and seeing I've had this for

3223
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:04,300
years, man.

3224
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:06,200
I've been like this for years and years and years.

3225
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:07,100
Yeah.

3226
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:08,900
Yeah, the self-diagnosis.

3227
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:09,700
Here's the thing, man.

3228
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:16,200
It's um, I spent years and years fighting through it and

3229
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:19,500
actually doing very well because like there were times where

3230
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:22,000
you know, I would leave the internet for like three months

3231
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,600
because something went down now.

3232
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:25,800
I might have to take a day off of something bad goes down.

3233
02:47:25,900 --> 02:47:29,600
Right there are times when like I couldn't focus on anything

3234
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:30,400
to get a video done.

3235
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:33,500
Like it took me like two months to get a video out now.

3236
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:36,700
I've been able to like hit spurts of one a day or one every

3237
02:47:36,700 --> 02:47:39,400
two days that last for a couple months and then I like relapse

3238
02:47:39,400 --> 02:47:40,600
back into old habits, right?

3239
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:44,200
I definitely hyper focus on video games for like 16 hours

3240
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:48,000
a day sometimes and also coffee gives me that very calming

3241
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,100
effect when it makes most other people jittery.

3242
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:54,500
What's the most recent video game you've binged out on?

3243
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:56,100
Oh, Project Zomboid.

3244
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:57,300
Really that good?

3245
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:58,400
Yep.

3246
02:47:59,700 --> 02:48:00,300
That's really good.

3247
02:48:00,300 --> 02:48:03,500
I've been playing XCOM 2 and I've been busy.

3248
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:06,100
I've been spending more time making all the little streamer

3249
02:48:06,100 --> 02:48:10,200
characters as the the people little XCOM agents, right and

3250
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:12,300
making sure that they're decorated correctly and things

3251
02:48:12,300 --> 02:48:12,900
like that.

3252
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:15,400
I don't know what that says about me as a gamer, but that's

3253
02:48:15,400 --> 02:48:17,700
been most of my experience and then I will play with them

3254
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:19,200
and see who dies first etcetera.

3255
02:48:19,900 --> 02:48:20,600
Right, right, right.

3256
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:23,500
You're trying to sing social contagion.

3257
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:24,100
Here's the thing.

3258
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:27,700
It's not social contagion because I've recognized this in

3259
02:48:27,700 --> 02:48:29,700
myself for over 10 years now.

3260
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:33,200
I just haven't been able to fully put it together until I

3261
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:36,000
watch Destiny go through like he had the same symptoms.

3262
02:48:36,200 --> 02:48:39,800
He went through a very similar process and it's and like

3263
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,600
you can say like copycat stuff because it's like a streamer

3264
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:43,400
you watch and they go.

3265
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:45,700
Yeah, I understand that there's definitely some danger of

3266
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:49,400
that but the fact that it that the symptoms he described

3267
02:48:49,400 --> 02:48:50,900
are so similar to similar to mine.

3268
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:53,600
It's like maybe I and here's the thing you can go on for

3269
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:56,000
medication for a month and then be like this ain't for me

3270
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
and then stop, you know, you're going to stay on it forever.

3271
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,700
You know guys like it's not one of those things.

3272
02:49:00,700 --> 02:49:00,900
Right?

3273
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:03,800
So I'm going to go like it most medications.

3274
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:10,300
Yeah, I might give it a go and just see like if after a month

3275
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:13,600
like there's also some reports of people who go on ADHD meds

3276
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:17,000
and they they report like losing all their creativity.

3277
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:17,800
I wouldn't want that to happen.

3278
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:18,200
Right?

3279
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:19,500
So if that happens, I'll stop taking it.

3280
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:20,400
It's like, you know, it's pretty easy.

3281
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:21,400
Um, okay.

3282
02:49:21,500 --> 02:49:24,100
To answer the actual question though, uh, Trump's legal

3283
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:26,300
argument today that he's entitled to absolute legal immunity.

3284
02:49:26,300 --> 02:49:27,600
You know, he mirrors a political rival.

3285
02:49:27,700 --> 02:49:28,600
Like that's fucking insane.

3286
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:32,200
Obviously there's no fucking, even if like, because of the

3287
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:35,100
way that some old law is written or something that's never

3288
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:36,100
going to hold up in court.

3289
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:37,500
Like that's, that's ridiculous.

3290
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:37,700
Right?

3291
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:42,100
Um, my favorite TV show, honestly, even though it's an

3292
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:43,400
anime, probably attack on Titan.

3293
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:47,200
Because I really like, I really liked it.

3294
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:50,000
I haven't, I haven't, honestly, it doesn't get good until

3295
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,700
season two and then it gets exponentially good every season

3296
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:53,800
through two, three, and four.

3297
02:49:53,900 --> 02:49:57,000
This is, is it on crunchy roll or whatever off the, yeah,

3298
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:57,600
yeah, it is.

3299
02:49:57,800 --> 02:49:58,500
I'm pretty sure it is.

3300
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:00,300
Um, five more dollars from common cure.

3301
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:03,800
Um, again, I'm prioritizing since we're coming to the end.

3302
02:50:03,800 --> 02:50:04,900
I'm prioritizing money.

3303
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:09,200
Uh, so if you pay me five dollars to say dev, please

3304
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:10,600
explain your thoughts on small towns.

3305
02:50:10,600 --> 02:50:12,700
You were shitting on them the other day and I was wondering

3306
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:14,200
if you thought there was any hope for them.

3307
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:15,800
Okay.

3308
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:19,100
So what he means when he says that I was shitting on them

3309
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:21,900
the other day is I put out this tweet.

3310
02:50:21,900 --> 02:50:23,100
Let's see if I can find it real quick.

3311
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:26,200
I'll do like a quick search of town or towns.

3312
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:26,800
Yeah.

3313
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:27,100
Okay.

3314
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:30,700
So I said that, uh, I grew up in a small town.

3315
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,200
Everyone was in your business.

3316
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:33,300
There was no privacy.

3317
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:34,200
There's no privacy.

3318
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:36,200
Infrastructure rollout was slow.

3319
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:39,200
People move away like crazy due to lack of opportunity.

3320
02:50:39,400 --> 02:50:40,900
Small businesses regularly die.

3321
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:42,200
Drugs are rampant.

3322
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:44,700
And my small town is now a ghost town.

3323
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:48,400
Uh, the towns, one large employer finally pulled out, leaving everybody

3324
02:50:48,400 --> 02:50:52,400
who stayed behind out of jobs, alcohol, alcoholism, and drug use is

3325
02:50:52,400 --> 02:50:54,600
skyrocketing be on it's already high rates.

3326
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:56,100
The place was on its deathbed.

3327
02:50:56,100 --> 02:50:59,200
Even before that though, there's no future in small towns.

3328
02:50:59,300 --> 02:51:02,400
That was my take basically because of my experience growing up in one,

3329
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:04,800
you know, I moved away to the city because there was nothing for me there.

3330
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:08,300
And like half of my, half of my graduating class in high school moved

3331
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:11,400
away to some city somewhere in Canada, where it's a Toronto or Vancouver

3332
02:51:11,400 --> 02:51:13,900
or, or Montreal or Ottawa or wherever.

3333
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:14,100
Right.

3334
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:15,700
They moved to some city and sort of died.

3335
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:20,000
Um, and then the half of them stayed behind and the half that stayed

3336
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,400
behind the half of that half.

3337
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:25,800
Like they're now druggies and they've like lost their kids.

3338
02:51:25,800 --> 02:51:26,800
I have them all on Facebook.

3339
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:28,700
So I'm like keeping track of the old drama back there.

3340
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Half of the half of the half that stayed behind are addicted

3341
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
to drugs or alcohol.

3342
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:34,600
A lot of them have lost their kids.

3343
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:39,600
There's like public fights breaking out and people like it's just trashy stuff.

3344
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:42,900
And then the remaining half that actually did have steady jobs and

3345
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:44,500
were doing okay for themselves.

3346
02:51:44,700 --> 02:51:47,900
Well, the town's one employer just pulled out and now there's no jobs

3347
02:51:47,900 --> 02:51:49,100
and everyone lost their jobs.

3348
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:53,700
And it's like, you know, I understand that there's the, like the right wing

3349
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:57,600
has this very nostalgic view of whatever, like a, you know, the peaceful small

3350
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:01,300
town where everything's a little bit slower and everyone's friendly.

3351
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:05,200
That might be true some places, but in my experience, it's not true.

3352
02:52:05,400 --> 02:52:08,400
In my experience, small towns are just places of despair.

3353
02:52:08,500 --> 02:52:10,700
I grew up as a military brat, right?

3354
02:52:10,700 --> 02:52:13,800
So I don't have no experience with city versus small town.

3355
02:52:13,800 --> 02:52:16,400
I was always on a military base of some sort, right?

3356
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:20,800
Growing up for most of my, my childhood, um, since I have grown

3357
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:24,700
up, however, and have lived on my own, I'm now 40 fucking years old.

3358
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:29,200
I have lived both in the city and I have lived in very, very small

3359
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:30,400
communities, right?

3360
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:36,600
My preference is to live in the small community and visit the city, but

3361
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:41,300
that's a, that's something where I've already, I have, I have, I have

3362
02:52:41,300 --> 02:52:44,200
a job outside of my local area, right?

3363
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:46,900
So, um, Doing streaming.

3364
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:49,500
I can do that from the city where I can do that from the small town.

3365
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:53,100
I prefer doing it from the small town because less people bother me.

3366
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:57,100
Um, I like the feeling of, of being kind of away from it all.

3367
02:52:57,300 --> 02:53:01,500
And if I need social interaction, which I do on occasion, I'll drive

3368
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:02,700
in and I'll slum it in the city.

3369
02:53:03,500 --> 02:53:04,100
Oh, that's fine.

3370
02:53:04,100 --> 02:53:04,300
Yep.

3371
02:53:04,700 --> 02:53:04,900
Yep.

3372
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:09,600
I mean, I live like 10 minutes from downtown where I am and I am actually

3373
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:13,400
moving cities in the spring and where I'll be moving is about a half

3374
02:53:13,400 --> 02:53:14,700
an hour from outside of downtown.

3375
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:17,100
So like it's, I'm still like in the city.

3376
02:53:17,400 --> 02:53:19,800
I can still access all the amenities of the city, but it's like a

3377
02:53:19,800 --> 02:53:21,400
quieter part of it, you know?

3378
02:53:21,900 --> 02:53:23,300
So, yeah.

3379
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:24,400
Cool.

3380
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:26,000
Uh, five more dollars for fun.

3381
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,600
Do is Wicca tactics gamer.

3382
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:29,900
Also, please watch Freerun beyond journey's end.

3383
02:53:30,500 --> 02:53:31,200
That's an anime.

3384
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:31,700
That's an anime.

3385
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:33,100
Okay.

3386
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:37,300
The current elf waifu who has the silver hair and the smug face.

3387
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:39,400
That's from the one that's on Twitter everywhere right now.

3388
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:40,700
That's Freerun beyond journey.

3389
02:53:40,700 --> 02:53:42,400
I don't follow the same people you do.

3390
02:53:42,400 --> 02:53:45,800
I don't see it unless it's a, you tweet, uh, I'll make sure to

3391
02:53:45,800 --> 02:53:46,200
retweet them.

3392
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:46,900
Oh, well, thank you.

3393
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:50,800
Uh, five more dollars from Artemus Fowls say object to the

3394
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:53,300
characterization of the immunity argument and the stupid phrasing

3395
02:53:53,700 --> 02:53:57,300
used by the Donator and Dev and five more dollars from Artemus

3396
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:57,700
Fowl.

3397
02:53:57,800 --> 02:54:00,100
There's nothing to argue the immunity arguments made by the

3398
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:02,500
Donator and Dev did not take place at this point.

3399
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:04,000
So here's the thing.

3400
02:54:04,300 --> 02:54:07,000
I've been, I know that this was, this is related to pondering

3401
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:07,600
politics.

3402
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:12,000
I've been arguing with Artemus in private now over the Jan six

3403
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:12,500
stuff.

3404
02:54:13,100 --> 02:54:15,000
And I was like, Artemus, listen, you've been sending me all this

3405
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,400
evidence out, believe your evidence after examining it, but

3406
02:54:17,400 --> 02:54:19,100
you like he, okay.

3407
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:21,700
I've seen Destiny talked to like Aidan Paladin who walked in

3408
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:22,900
with nothing and got destroyed.

3409
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:23,400
All right.

3410
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:26,700
I saw Destiny talk to Rob Knorr who did better than Aidan

3411
02:54:26,700 --> 02:54:28,300
Paladin, but still got destroyed.

3412
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:34,100
But, um, Artemus is unironically presenting to me more evidence

3413
02:54:34,500 --> 02:54:39,600
of the Trump side of the January 6th and election conversations

3414
02:54:39,900 --> 02:54:41,800
than I've seen from anybody before.

3415
02:54:42,100 --> 02:54:42,600
All right.

3416
02:54:42,900 --> 02:54:46,000
So I do think that speaking to Artemus about this topic is

3417
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:46,600
worthwhile.

3418
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:49,500
I still think he's, I think he's, I think Artemus is

3419
02:54:49,500 --> 02:54:52,600
fundamentally wrong about them, but he's, he's like, he's

3420
02:54:52,600 --> 02:54:54,700
actually bringing evidence that I haven't seen anyone talk

3421
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:55,600
about before, which is interesting.

3422
02:54:56,200 --> 02:54:56,400
Yeah.

3423
02:54:56,400 --> 02:54:58,400
So like, that's why I've said like, Hey, listen, Artemus

3424
02:54:58,500 --> 02:55:00,800
probably should talk to Brianna Wu at some point.

3425
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:03,800
Artemus probably should talk to pondering politics at some

3426
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:04,100
point.

3427
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:06,900
I tried to set up Artemus versus Destiny, but artists wouldn't

3428
02:55:06,900 --> 02:55:07,300
do it.

3429
02:55:08,100 --> 02:55:09,500
Artemus, what are you doing?

3430
02:55:09,600 --> 02:55:12,100
Come on, come on.

3431
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:15,200
Look, you're, you're a reasonable guy.

3432
02:55:15,400 --> 02:55:16,400
You're a rational guy.

3433
02:55:16,700 --> 02:55:18,600
You're a civil guy.

3434
02:55:19,300 --> 02:55:21,600
We need more of that in this space, less screaming

3435
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:24,400
autistically and more civil reasonable.

3436
02:55:24,500 --> 02:55:27,000
Here's evidence and we can argue over the evidence.

3437
02:55:27,300 --> 02:55:28,200
That would be great.

3438
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:30,700
And pondering politics is down for it, right?

3439
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
We could do a pondering politics versus the world thing

3440
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:33,600
if you want.

3441
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:37,000
Like, do you want to do, do you want to do Artemus fallow

3442
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:38,300
versus pondering politics?

3443
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:38,900
That'd be interesting.

3444
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:43,200
Yes, because so, so I pondering politics, I don't know if

3445
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:43,600
you heard me.

3446
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:44,900
I'll just repeat it very quickly.

3447
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:50,300
Artemus of the people who are on the pro-Trump side of January

3448
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:51,800
26th and the 2020 election.

3449
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:55,500
Artemus is probably the most reasonable person I've seen

3450
02:55:55,900 --> 02:55:59,000
more so than anyone that Destiny's debated on his channel

3451
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:01,200
or that usually do these sorts of debates.

3452
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:04,000
Artemus does seem to be the most reasonable person of that

3453
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,900
side, even though I think he's wrong.

3454
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:10,900
Still he has better arguments and he brings up more evidence

3455
02:56:10,900 --> 02:56:11,700
than any of them.

3456
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:14,600
And this is to you Dev and I can set up this up with you.

3457
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:18,300
But if I think that to add to that and I'm not sure where

3458
02:56:18,300 --> 02:56:22,500
I'd rate them, but are you familiar with a streamer small

3459
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:25,200
libertarian streamer named Lactoid?

3460
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:30,800
No, no, he's another he's a practicing lawyer, right and

3461
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:32,500
he has a very good grasp.

3462
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:35,700
We did a discussion on last year.

3463
02:56:35,700 --> 02:56:39,500
I said as long time ago at the end of December with Pisco

3464
02:56:39,700 --> 02:56:44,500
pondering politics Lactoid and a couple others about the Trump

3465
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:48,100
removing the Trump from the ballot in Colorado, right?

3466
02:56:48,800 --> 02:56:49,900
He brings facts.

3467
02:56:49,900 --> 02:56:50,800
He brings figures.

3468
02:56:51,900 --> 02:56:53,500
He's a pretty reasonable guy.

3469
02:56:53,500 --> 02:56:56,600
So you might enjoy if you enjoy Artemis Fowl, you might enjoy

3470
02:56:56,600 --> 02:56:57,100
him too.

3471
02:56:57,200 --> 02:56:59,700
Not to say you're not you're not a great guy.

3472
02:56:59,700 --> 02:57:01,300
Artemus Fowl, we like you, Artemus Fowl.

3473
02:57:01,300 --> 02:57:02,700
I just want to broaden our heart.

3474
02:57:03,700 --> 02:57:04,500
Here's the thing, right?

3475
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:06,600
Like I do not know much.

3476
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:09,100
I mean, I know some of American law, but I'm not I'm no expert,

3477
02:57:09,100 --> 02:57:13,500
right? My wheelhouse has always been political theory and

3478
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:16,200
to a lesser extent history and then of course video games,

3479
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:16,500
right?

3480
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:17,700
That's unrelated to politics.

3481
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:19,900
But political theory and history is my thing.

3482
02:57:19,900 --> 02:57:22,900
Like I can sit here and tell you the entire life story of

3483
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:23,600
Antonio Graham.

3484
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:24,700
She off the top of my head.

3485
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,900
I cannot tell you whether or not any of these indictments

3486
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:31,400
are 100% going to go for Trump or not, you know, like I

3487
02:57:31,400 --> 02:57:33,800
can tell an arm is found even when he calls them like I'm

3488
02:57:33,800 --> 02:57:34,400
not a lawyer.

3489
02:57:34,400 --> 02:57:35,600
I can't argue these.

3490
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:36,800
I don't know, right?

3491
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:39,300
I just don't know and I'm not going to pretend I do.

3492
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,900
Artemis Fowl another five dollars.

3493
02:57:42,900 --> 02:57:45,700
I will inevitably be sided with by the courts and why destiny

3494
02:57:45,700 --> 02:57:48,700
will be mad and blame the Supreme the corrupt quote-unquote

3495
02:57:48,700 --> 02:57:52,900
Supreme Court think so so because here's the thing like

3496
02:57:52,900 --> 02:57:53,900
there's here.

3497
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,800
Let's say that the best possible scenario is that the Georgia

3498
02:57:57,800 --> 02:58:00,900
Rico case completely falls apart because of what Artemis

3499
02:58:00,900 --> 02:58:02,800
Fowl presented at the start of the stream, right?

3500
02:58:02,800 --> 02:58:06,400
The the person appoints the his her boyfriend and it was

3501
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:09,200
improper and something actually comes out of the meetings

3502
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:11,600
with with Biden and like let's say that everything falls

3503
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:12,300
apart, right?

3504
02:58:12,400 --> 02:58:15,500
So the Georgia Rico case is now out isn't there still

3505
02:58:15,500 --> 02:58:17,600
three more indictments against Trump?

3506
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:20,600
I'm pretty sure there's at least three more and the documents

3507
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:24,300
one looks like the documents one appears to be ironclad

3508
02:58:24,300 --> 02:58:25,100
against Trump.

3509
02:58:25,300 --> 02:58:30,000
So I'm just sitting here thinking like even if even if Georgia

3510
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:33,300
Rico falls apart because of what Artemis presented earlier,

3511
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:35,500
like that's only one angle of attack against Trump right

3512
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:39,100
now. Yeah, but the classified documents case has the most

3513
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:41,000
favorable judge a lean cannon.

3514
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,800
So it's entirely possible between that and a favorable jury

3515
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:46,200
pulled it even though they have the debt to rights on the

3516
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:49,100
case during nullification to get in the day.

3517
02:58:49,900 --> 02:58:50,500
Well, I think so.

3518
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:52,800
Well, hello, Josiah Potter in politics.

3519
02:58:53,900 --> 02:58:55,200
You're going to be a last caller by the way.

3520
02:58:56,200 --> 02:58:57,300
Hey, wait.

3521
02:58:57,300 --> 02:58:57,800
No art.

3522
02:58:57,800 --> 02:58:58,800
Artemis is in the chat there.

3523
02:58:58,800 --> 02:58:59,300
Bring him in.

3524
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:03,000
We'll do it right now with right now.

3525
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:04,400
Hi Artemis.

3526
02:59:06,200 --> 02:59:07,100
What's going on?

3527
02:59:07,800 --> 02:59:08,900
Hey, dude, what's up?

3528
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:10,600
Oh, just hanging out.

3529
02:59:11,500 --> 02:59:13,700
Also, you're in the room.

3530
02:59:13,700 --> 02:59:16,900
Same room Josiah meet Artemis Artemis.

3531
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:18,600
Hey, we talked we talked before.

3532
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:19,200
What's up, buddy?

3533
02:59:19,600 --> 02:59:21,600
But have you guys really actually on my show?

3534
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:23,000
Yes, I believe.

3535
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,400
Oh, oh neat.

3536
02:59:24,700 --> 02:59:29,200
Oh, is this the the guy that said that the the crew people

3537
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:32,100
that brought the Colorado case were nonpartisan?

3538
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:35,200
That they are a non-profit.

3539
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:37,500
Yeah, that was that was not correct.

3540
02:59:38,200 --> 02:59:39,800
They no, no, no, no, no, no.

3541
02:59:39,800 --> 02:59:42,700
Well that they are a non-profit but they were the argument

3542
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:43,700
was that they were partisan.

3543
02:59:43,800 --> 02:59:44,900
Now that they were nonprofit.

3544
02:59:44,900 --> 02:59:45,400
They okay.

3545
02:59:45,400 --> 02:59:48,500
So you were the guy who said the Democrats brought the case

3546
02:59:48,500 --> 02:59:49,200
even though it was right.

3547
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:49,800
It was media.

3548
02:59:49,900 --> 02:59:53,300
It was Republican and Independent voters who by the way

3549
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:56,700
are famously not Democrat Republicans are that the one the

3550
02:59:56,700 --> 02:59:59,900
one Republican voter that seems to be voting in every state

3551
02:59:59,900 --> 03:00:03,400
somehow and is bringing the case by a company owned by media

3552
03:00:03,400 --> 03:00:03,900
matters.

3553
03:00:04,300 --> 03:00:04,800
I don't know.

3554
03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:05,600
So, okay.

3555
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:07,400
He's not they're not the party to the case.

3556
03:00:07,400 --> 03:00:08,300
It's the Republican.

3557
03:00:08,300 --> 03:00:11,900
They found they found they found a guy that would push it.

3558
03:00:11,900 --> 03:00:12,300
Yes.

3559
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:12,600
Yes.

3560
03:00:12,600 --> 03:00:13,100
Thank you.

3561
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:16,900
Case on the part on behalf of Republicans and Independents.

3562
03:00:17,500 --> 03:00:19,500
We want to frame this as a strictly partisan issue.

3563
03:00:19,500 --> 03:00:20,500
It is a partisan issue.

3564
03:00:20,500 --> 03:00:21,100
Everybody can see it.

3565
03:00:21,100 --> 03:00:22,700
That's why it's being thrown out everywhere else.

3566
03:00:22,700 --> 03:00:23,100
Wait a minute.

3567
03:00:23,100 --> 03:00:25,600
So it's a partisan issue when Republicans and Independents

3568
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:29,400
bring the case when media matters when media matters shops

3569
03:00:29,400 --> 03:00:32,600
around and finds one guy that's willing to be it doesn't matter

3570
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:33,200
that they shop.

3571
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:36,300
It doesn't matter that they shop around Republican voters

3572
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:39,800
and Independent voters brought the case by definition you

3573
03:00:39,800 --> 03:00:41,700
keep saying Republican voters.

3574
03:00:41,700 --> 03:00:43,300
They literally found so okay.

3575
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:44,000
I should clear this up.

3576
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:44,700
I should clear this up.

3577
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:48,200
So Republicans are the people who vote typically for Trump.

3578
03:00:48,200 --> 03:00:50,100
Okay Democrats are a different party.

3579
03:00:51,800 --> 03:00:52,800
Okay, come on guys.

3580
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:55,100
You could you could do whatever you want say that but everybody

3581
03:00:55,100 --> 03:00:58,200
I understand I know I have all these other state rulings.

3582
03:00:58,400 --> 03:01:01,800
So Donald Trump is a Republican if that helps.

3583
03:01:01,800 --> 03:01:02,900
He's not a Democrat.

3584
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:04,700
He's not even a Republican at this point.

3585
03:01:04,700 --> 03:01:06,700
I don't I don't even know what he is a Republican.

3586
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:09,100
So you struggle with words.

3587
03:01:09,100 --> 03:01:09,900
It seems to me.

3588
03:01:09,900 --> 03:01:12,700
I think I think why is it becoming personal?

3589
03:01:14,800 --> 03:01:15,300
He lied.

3590
03:01:15,300 --> 03:01:18,600
He lied to people on fucking this guy's lying right now saying

3591
03:01:18,600 --> 03:01:21,900
that they were not a Republican even though he's running as

3592
03:01:21,900 --> 03:01:23,300
the Republican candidate.

3593
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:26,400
He was the Republican is Bernie Sanders a Democrat and in 20

3594
03:01:26,400 --> 03:01:29,500
no, he's a registered Independent who caucuses with Democrats

3595
03:01:30,300 --> 03:01:34,200
weird, so is Donald Trump is Donald Trump an independent

3596
03:01:34,200 --> 03:01:38,900
or a Republican I would say Republican I would say he runs

3597
03:01:38,900 --> 03:01:41,900
in the Republican hold on.

3598
03:01:41,900 --> 03:01:46,100
Hey, hold on.

3599
03:01:46,100 --> 03:01:46,500
Hold on.

3600
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:46,900
Hold on.

3601
03:01:46,900 --> 03:01:50,000
He's doing Hassan pikers bullshit of arguing some tangents.

3602
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:54,100
Is this on pikers bullshit using like facts logic and definition.

3603
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:55,800
No, it's definitely not.

3604
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:56,500
It is definitely.

3605
03:01:56,500 --> 03:02:01,400
Well, hold on like you guys guys can I jump in here?

3606
03:02:01,900 --> 03:02:05,500
Let's have maybe be a be the the centrist that he was born

3607
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:06,200
with the centrist.

3608
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:11,400
Okay, I mean, it's very clear that Donald Trump is a part

3609
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:12,500
of the Republican Party.

3610
03:02:12,500 --> 03:02:15,100
However, it's also very clear that he has no I'm sorry.

3611
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:18,400
He finished me finish you tell that I just want I just want

3612
03:02:18,400 --> 03:02:20,300
I already missed that.

3613
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:24,600
However, it's also very clear that Donald Trump has no real

3614
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:25,800
allegiance to it.

3615
03:02:25,900 --> 03:02:28,000
And if it served his purposes, he would leave it.

3616
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:28,800
Correct.

3617
03:02:28,800 --> 03:02:32,200
So so what are we probably what Artemis Fowl should have

3618
03:02:32,200 --> 03:02:35,500
said is that Donald Trump is not conservative and he's not

3619
03:02:35,500 --> 03:02:36,100
conservative.

3620
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:36,700
I would agree.

3621
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:41,000
But he is a Republican a Republican is part of a political

3622
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:44,100
party. Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican.

3623
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:45,000
I understand.

3624
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:48,100
This is Hassan Parker fucking thing to do in an argument

3625
03:02:48,100 --> 03:02:48,800
Artemis Fowl.

3626
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:54,000
I'm going to tell you genius and you're an adult idiot.

3627
03:02:54,900 --> 03:03:00,900
Okay, we're going to do this.

3628
03:03:00,900 --> 03:03:01,800
We're going to do this.

3629
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:05,100
Both of you stop both of you stop.

3630
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:09,400
I mean, I would love to have this as an actual kind of back

3631
03:03:09,400 --> 03:03:09,900
and forth.

3632
03:03:10,100 --> 03:03:12,900
I don't think that now is the best time for it when we're

3633
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:17,900
closing down because we're about to get a whole lot of I need

3634
03:03:17,900 --> 03:03:20,200
to say something because you told me I could after I waited

3635
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:20,700
for death.

3636
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:22,600
Well, okay, sure.

3637
03:03:22,600 --> 03:03:23,100
Go ahead.

3638
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:24,900
But then I'm going to say as well.

3639
03:03:24,900 --> 03:03:27,200
So there was a statement at the end of a stream about the

3640
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:30,300
Colorado Supreme Court decision and that it was brought by

3641
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:33,800
a nonpartisan organization and that was claimed here on the

3642
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:34,700
stream to you.

3643
03:03:34,700 --> 03:03:35,700
What was the organization?

3644
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:39,500
It was Cruz something or responsibility and ethics in Washington.

3645
03:03:39,500 --> 03:03:41,900
So I would watch dog.

3646
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:42,200
Yeah.

3647
03:03:42,200 --> 03:03:42,400
Yeah.

3648
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:43,900
And there are they actually nonpartisan?

3649
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:48,600
No, they well, well, they they are actually they are led by

3650
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:49,900
a Bush-era Republican.

3651
03:03:49,900 --> 03:03:52,400
He can he struggles with the word, but a Republican is not

3652
03:03:52,400 --> 03:03:55,700
a Democrat and they go after Democratic corruption to there

3653
03:03:55,700 --> 03:03:58,300
just happens to be more corruption on the Republican side

3654
03:03:58,300 --> 03:04:02,600
and this was this was this was the the bot and Bailey site

3655
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:05,000
mountain Bailey, there we go.

3656
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:09,500
So after looking into it and looking at all of the receipts

3657
03:04:09,500 --> 03:04:12,600
and everything for it media media matters actually owns

3658
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:15,600
crew. They actually have they they're in the same building

3659
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:18,400
ran by have multiple people that in the same organizations

3660
03:04:18,400 --> 03:04:21,400
working in in different parts of each.

3661
03:04:21,900 --> 03:04:23,500
It is it is.

3662
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:27,400
So it is not a nonpartisan organization.

3663
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:28,700
It is ran by media matters.

3664
03:04:28,700 --> 03:04:30,200
It gets funded by Democratic.

3665
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:31,500
What do you call it?

3666
03:04:32,700 --> 03:04:33,700
Donor dark money.

3667
03:04:33,700 --> 03:04:36,000
Yeah, dark blue stuff.

3668
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:36,400
Basically.

3669
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:36,700
Yes.

3670
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:37,700
Yes.

3671
03:04:37,700 --> 03:04:39,300
So it's not a nonpartisan group.

3672
03:04:39,300 --> 03:04:40,900
I don't know why people keep claiming that just because

3673
03:04:40,900 --> 03:04:44,200
there's a Republican in it instead of just covers a Republican.

3674
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:44,900
What is the name of it again?

3675
03:04:44,900 --> 03:04:46,000
I'm looking at real.

3676
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:46,500
What's the name of it?

3677
03:04:47,300 --> 03:04:50,800
This is for responsibility and ethics in Washington.

3678
03:04:51,300 --> 03:04:54,500
Okay, I had a big issue with this because I don't like

3679
03:04:54,500 --> 03:04:59,100
when people try to couch obviously partisan hackery behind

3680
03:04:59,100 --> 03:05:03,400
a veneer of non-partisanship that was my I understand

3681
03:05:03,400 --> 03:05:05,800
I understand so he takes issue with the fact that it's

3682
03:05:05,800 --> 03:05:08,500
led by a Republican and cases in question have been brought

3683
03:05:08,500 --> 03:05:12,100
by Republican and independent voters, but because he's

3684
03:05:12,100 --> 03:05:12,900
a MAGA cultist.

3685
03:05:12,900 --> 03:05:14,000
He can't cope with that.

3686
03:05:14,700 --> 03:05:16,700
Listen, it's all it's all partisan.

3687
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:18,400
Well, then you never voted for trouble.

3688
03:05:18,400 --> 03:05:22,000
Then you shouldn't have a problem reconciling this organization

3689
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:25,800
is an organization goes after corruption including Democratic

3690
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:27,900
corruption. You see what they have to say about Senator

3691
03:05:27,900 --> 03:05:30,600
Bob Menendez and elected Democratic senator.

3692
03:05:31,100 --> 03:05:34,500
They're led by a Republican and if the cases in question

3693
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:37,300
are brought by Republican and independent voters, then

3694
03:05:37,300 --> 03:05:41,600
it's probably fair to say it's nonpartisan just because

3695
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:42,800
it's against Trump.

3696
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:47,200
Maybe maybe there's actually a valid case against Trump.

3697
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:48,600
Now, we're going to hold on a second.

3698
03:05:48,700 --> 03:05:53,800
We're going to look at that go go ahead the donors to crew

3699
03:05:53,800 --> 03:05:57,400
include such groups as Democracy Alliance, which is a network

3700
03:05:57,400 --> 03:06:00,800
of progressive mega donors service Employees International

3701
03:06:00,800 --> 03:06:04,800
Union, which is a union in Canada the United States featuring

3702
03:06:04,900 --> 03:06:08,300
service workers or representing service workers the ARCA Foundation

3703
03:06:08,300 --> 03:06:12,000
which is a progressive American philanthropic Foundation

3704
03:06:13,100 --> 03:06:17,000
and the Gill Foundation, which is an LGBT Foundation.

3705
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:20,100
I mean, even if founded by a Republican it does seem to

3706
03:06:20,100 --> 03:06:22,100
be funded primarily by left-leaning sources.

3707
03:06:22,100 --> 03:06:24,500
It is it is not a nonpartisan organization.

3708
03:06:24,500 --> 03:06:25,400
This is just a fuck.

3709
03:06:25,400 --> 03:06:28,500
So what do you so what is nonpartisan?

3710
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:30,700
It is let's clear it up.

3711
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:31,500
Let's go ahead.

3712
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:36,700
It is a or is media matters a nonpartisan organization.

3713
03:06:36,700 --> 03:06:38,000
What does nonpartisan me?

3714
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:42,100
Hold on because maybe we have a lot of you what okay to

3715
03:06:42,100 --> 03:06:42,900
rephrase the question.

3716
03:06:42,900 --> 03:06:46,600
Can you give us an example Artemis of a nonpartisan organization

3717
03:06:46,600 --> 03:06:47,300
in your opinion?

3718
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:48,300
What would you go?

3719
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:49,400
Jesus.

3720
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:50,200
Let's see.

3721
03:06:52,300 --> 03:06:57,600
The DMV DMV is a government agency.

3722
03:06:57,600 --> 03:07:02,000
What about a political organization clarify a political

3723
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:03,000
organization?

3724
03:07:04,500 --> 03:07:06,000
Fire would be one.

3725
03:07:06,300 --> 03:07:07,400
I'll give them that one.

3726
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:09,800
I heard of that the fire.org.

3727
03:07:09,800 --> 03:07:13,600
It's a free speech free speech organization Foundation of

3728
03:07:13,600 --> 03:07:15,000
individual rights and expression.

3729
03:07:15,900 --> 03:07:17,000
It takes.

3730
03:07:17,100 --> 03:07:19,000
Oh, yes left right and center though.

3731
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:22,000
A lot of people have accused them of being right-leaning

3732
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:26,300
because some of their donors are from the right some of them.

3733
03:07:26,300 --> 03:07:26,700
Okay.

3734
03:07:26,800 --> 03:07:30,300
Do you have another one SPJ the Society of professional

3735
03:07:30,300 --> 03:07:31,800
journalists would probably another one.

3736
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:33,500
All right.

3737
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:36,500
So here's my question if we go through this in real time.

3738
03:07:36,500 --> 03:07:41,300
Can we find examples of allegations where or credible evidence

3739
03:07:41,300 --> 03:07:45,200
where the nonpartisan groups that you list skew towards a

3740
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:49,700
particular political affiliation because here's my point.

3741
03:07:49,700 --> 03:07:51,200
I want to be very clear about this.

3742
03:07:51,500 --> 03:07:55,800
I do not mean to suggest that Cruz output is neutral in the

3743
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:59,600
sense that for every Republican complaint, they have a Democrat

3744
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:03,200
complaint want to be very clear about that it go after Republicans

3745
03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:04,300
more than Democrats.

3746
03:08:04,300 --> 03:08:07,300
The reason I call them nonpartisan is that they will go after

3747
03:08:07,300 --> 03:08:10,200
Democrats when they think Democrats are guilty of corruption.

3748
03:08:10,200 --> 03:08:12,200
Bob Menendez is a great example.

3749
03:08:12,700 --> 03:08:15,000
I think you're struggling to deal with in my opinion.

3750
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,800
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you have good examples to the contrary

3751
03:08:18,100 --> 03:08:20,900
is that right now there tends to be more corruption within

3752
03:08:20,900 --> 03:08:24,300
the Republican Party than there does the Democratic Party,

3753
03:08:24,300 --> 03:08:27,900
which is why you don't see what do you have evidence for

3754
03:08:27,900 --> 03:08:28,400
that claim?

3755
03:08:28,400 --> 03:08:34,600
I can give you examples like so no evidence like numbers like

3756
03:08:34,600 --> 03:08:36,100
I don't need fucking anecdotes.

3757
03:08:36,100 --> 03:08:39,100
Why do you keep saying that you're you're giving me anecdotes

3758
03:08:39,100 --> 03:08:40,700
when you talk about the partisanship?

3759
03:08:40,700 --> 03:08:42,800
You're like, no, no, no, I don't think they're I don't think

3760
03:08:42,800 --> 03:08:43,900
they're nonpartisan.

3761
03:08:43,900 --> 03:08:48,000
They skew too much towards the left and then the examples

3762
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:51,000
that some of the examples that you just provided apparently

3763
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:53,400
the perception is they skew to the right.

3764
03:08:53,600 --> 03:08:57,600
I don't have hard data to how would how would I compute that?

3765
03:08:57,800 --> 03:08:58,400
I'm confused.

3766
03:08:58,700 --> 03:09:01,800
Well, first of all, I'm going to be a wick partisan jmac.

3767
03:09:01,800 --> 03:09:04,900
Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships really appreciate

3768
03:09:04,900 --> 03:09:09,100
you. Congratulations to all those who get those memberships

3769
03:09:09,100 --> 03:09:10,900
anyway, I'm confused.

3770
03:09:10,900 --> 03:09:16,200
Is it media matters the organization that try to get all

3771
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:21,400
of the was it the stuff pulled from X by intentionally fucking

3772
03:09:21,400 --> 03:09:25,900
with the algorithm to put advertising next to Nazi tweets

3773
03:09:26,500 --> 03:09:26,700
also?

3774
03:09:26,700 --> 03:09:27,500
Hey jmac.

3775
03:09:27,700 --> 03:09:30,100
What can you jmac is the answer is yes.

3776
03:09:30,100 --> 03:09:33,600
I don't know who he is individually, but I know he comes

3777
03:09:33,600 --> 03:09:37,900
around sometimes and says hi jmac is the Adam and sitch mega

3778
03:09:37,900 --> 03:09:38,500
whale.

3779
03:09:38,600 --> 03:09:42,000
Oh the mega whale the Adam and sitch mega whale won't look

3780
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,200
throw some of that whale action my way buddy.

3781
03:09:44,300 --> 03:09:45,100
Thank you for being here.

3782
03:09:45,100 --> 03:09:47,500
Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships really appreciate

3783
03:09:47,500 --> 03:09:49,100
you. Yeah, jmac.

3784
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:50,600
I was dreaming tomorrow.

3785
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:51,200
Join me.

3786
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:58,100
Jamie medium letters backs crew makes me partisan.

3787
03:10:00,400 --> 03:10:00,900
Hmm.

3788
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:02,800
I would say no.

3789
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:06,200
I would say you won't let him answer let him answer like

3790
03:10:06,200 --> 03:10:07,100
because you asked him a question.

3791
03:10:08,100 --> 03:10:08,800
He asked.

3792
03:10:08,900 --> 03:10:09,200
Okay.

3793
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:10,900
Well, you can ask the full thing, but I think you got the

3794
03:10:10,900 --> 03:10:11,400
point across.

3795
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:14,400
He's asking if something is sponsored by something.

3796
03:10:14,600 --> 03:10:16,800
Does that make it innately partisan?

3797
03:10:17,800 --> 03:10:21,600
But the fact is is that media matters and crew both have

3798
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:25,700
multiple people from both that work in both companies and

3799
03:10:25,700 --> 03:10:29,100
I'll put the lawyers are pushed the media matters lawyers

3800
03:10:29,100 --> 03:10:30,500
are in the crew case.

3801
03:10:31,300 --> 03:10:33,500
You can since you talked about evidence.

3802
03:10:33,500 --> 03:10:34,700
Can you send me that link?

3803
03:10:35,200 --> 03:10:37,100
Yeah, let me actually shit.

3804
03:10:37,100 --> 03:10:37,300
Rick.

3805
03:10:37,300 --> 03:10:38,400
Do you still have that?

3806
03:10:39,300 --> 03:10:41,800
So I said to you ready 20 links dude.

3807
03:10:41,800 --> 03:10:43,200
I probably do.

3808
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:45,700
I could help probably there.

3809
03:10:45,700 --> 03:10:46,800
I'd have to look for it.

3810
03:10:46,800 --> 03:10:52,100
So so the socialist answer to this is that as long as money

3811
03:10:52,100 --> 03:10:55,000
is changing hands, they're inherently corrupt and it's eternal

3812
03:10:55,200 --> 03:10:59,200
and that's just how it is and that nothing everything is

3813
03:10:59,200 --> 03:10:59,700
political.

3814
03:10:59,700 --> 03:11:01,400
Nothing can truly be nonpartisan.

3815
03:11:01,700 --> 03:11:04,200
And listen, I'm I'm fine.

3816
03:11:04,300 --> 03:11:05,800
I'm fine with that.

3817
03:11:05,800 --> 03:11:08,900
I'll if that's your definition of what a nonpartisan is.

3818
03:11:08,900 --> 03:11:11,700
I'm fine with it's very strict, but I'm fine with the reason

3819
03:11:11,700 --> 03:11:14,800
I said they're nonpartisan is because they will go after

3820
03:11:14,800 --> 03:11:17,100
instances of Democratic corruption as well.

3821
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:20,300
I use Bob Menendez as a great recent example.

3822
03:11:20,500 --> 03:11:22,100
That's why I said they're nonpartisan.

3823
03:11:22,300 --> 03:11:26,800
I don't and I also like the concept of they get one off

3824
03:11:27,300 --> 03:11:30,300
like one one Democrat for every thousand Republicans or

3825
03:11:30,300 --> 03:11:32,800
whatever. That's that what is that what the ratio is?

3826
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:36,600
I have no idea but the like I've seen media matters do this.

3827
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:38,000
Wait, what is that?

3828
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:38,800
What is the ratio?

3829
03:11:38,800 --> 03:11:39,800
That's media matters.

3830
03:11:39,800 --> 03:11:40,700
I'm five percent.

3831
03:11:40,700 --> 03:11:43,000
I don't know the ratio be clear, but it's a ratio is like

3832
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:46,700
big 55% of the people that get got by them are Republicans

3833
03:11:46,700 --> 03:11:48,100
and 45% are Democrats.

3834
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:52,800
Does that is that close enough to suggest non-partisanship

3835
03:11:52,800 --> 03:11:54,400
to you or is it too much?

3836
03:11:54,700 --> 03:11:57,500
I think anything like 70 30 would be fine.

3837
03:11:57,500 --> 03:12:02,400
Like I don't really yeah, so I don't have a breakdown of

3838
03:12:02,400 --> 03:12:03,000
the cases.

3839
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:06,200
I don't all I know is that yes, they go after Republicans

3840
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:08,800
more but they have gone after Democrats as well.

3841
03:12:09,200 --> 03:12:12,000
They are or were led by a George W.

3842
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:17,100
Bush former employee a bush-era Republican and our media

3843
03:12:17,100 --> 03:12:19,400
matters. That's a different organization.

3844
03:12:19,400 --> 03:12:21,700
If you want to make allegations about media matters,

3845
03:12:21,700 --> 03:12:22,500
I'm fine with that.

3846
03:12:22,500 --> 03:12:25,100
I'm not nearly as conversant on media matters and they're

3847
03:12:25,100 --> 03:12:28,700
not party to the lawsuit as far as the lawsuits are concerned.

3848
03:12:28,700 --> 03:12:31,400
The reason that I made a big deal about of this if I remember

3849
03:12:31,400 --> 03:12:34,300
our first conversation is because the lawsuits are being

3850
03:12:34,300 --> 03:12:36,700
brought by Republican and independent voters.

3851
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:43,100
I found something I found something as relevant.

3852
03:12:43,100 --> 03:12:45,500
Okay, so right on the Wikipedia page.

3853
03:12:46,700 --> 03:12:51,500
Basically from 2005 and 2014 their annual reports named

3854
03:12:51,700 --> 03:12:57,300
25 corrupt Democrats and 63 corrupt Republicans, so that

3855
03:12:57,300 --> 03:13:01,500
would be 28% Democratic and then whatever the other amount

3856
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:03,200
is. When did media matters by?

3857
03:13:04,200 --> 03:13:04,700
I don't know.

3858
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:07,600
I see through you're going to find out that that number

3859
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:10,800
is going to add line up pretty quick, but to kind of interrogate

3860
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:11,400
you pondering.

3861
03:13:11,400 --> 03:13:14,600
I said both of them too, by the way ting great and interrogate

3862
03:13:14,600 --> 03:13:17,600
you pondering for the moment or under that definition of

3863
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:22,800
going after the other side and as an astute wick chatter

3864
03:13:22,800 --> 03:13:27,300
pointed out would that make Fox News nonpartisan because

3865
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:30,100
they sometimes will go after Republicans as well.

3866
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:36,500
I would say that Fox News has a liberal or excuse me a

3867
03:13:36,500 --> 03:13:39,500
conservative bent, but this was my point when we go back

3868
03:13:39,500 --> 03:13:45,100
to nonpartisan as I said probably 15 minutes ago if if Artemis

3869
03:13:45,100 --> 03:13:54,500
wants to say that crew has a favorable is a favorable perception

3870
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:58,100
of Democrats because they criticize Democrats less often.

3871
03:13:58,100 --> 03:13:59,200
I'm sympathetic to that.

3872
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:03,600
I just think that I that to me doesn't contradict nonpartisan

3873
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:07,600
unless you have an extremely strict view of what nonpartisan

3874
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:11,500
is which is for every complaint you have against a Democrat

3875
03:14:11,700 --> 03:14:15,200
you have to bring one against a Republican and vice versa.

3876
03:14:15,500 --> 03:14:20,600
I do not contest that crew spends more time going after Republicans

3877
03:14:20,600 --> 03:14:23,400
than Democrats and never suggested otherwise.

3878
03:14:23,600 --> 03:14:26,000
The reason I said that they were nonpartisan is because they're

3879
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:29,600
an anti-corruption watchdog group that will persistently

3880
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:33,000
go after corruption even from Democrats.

3881
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:36,200
They just don't go after Democrats as often I would argue

3882
03:14:36,600 --> 03:14:39,300
that's a function of Republicans just being more corrupt.

3883
03:14:42,900 --> 03:14:46,900
Yeah, I'm going to go with the it is obviously it's ran by

3884
03:14:46,900 --> 03:14:47,700
media matters.

3885
03:14:48,600 --> 03:14:51,700
It is looks like I can't find when they when they purchase

3886
03:14:51,700 --> 03:14:52,000
it though.

3887
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:53,600
I can't find that it's 2015.

3888
03:14:54,200 --> 03:15:02,200
Yeah, there was a a article that came out saying look who

3889
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:05,500
now owns it or whatever the fuck or lined with it.

3890
03:15:05,500 --> 03:15:07,100
I have to go find it again.

3891
03:15:07,800 --> 03:15:09,200
Okay, that sounds good.

3892
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:09,900
I can find it.

3893
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:13,700
No again, I'm fine with that but it was Republicans and

3894
03:15:13,700 --> 03:15:15,400
independents who brought the case.

3895
03:15:15,400 --> 03:15:18,000
It's not just liberals bringing this case.

3896
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:20,200
I don't know why you think that that means anything they

3897
03:15:20,200 --> 03:15:22,200
found a fucking why wait.

3898
03:15:22,200 --> 03:15:26,000
Why why do I think that it matters that no, no, it doesn't

3899
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:29,000
matter what case we're even are you even arguing about the

3900
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:32,600
Colorado the Colorado removal of Trump from the ballot?

3901
03:15:32,600 --> 03:15:36,400
Yeah, so Artemis right Democrats in the left bringing this

3902
03:15:36,400 --> 03:15:39,700
stuff against Trump and my position is it's a bit more nuanced

3903
03:15:39,700 --> 03:15:42,600
than that because Republicans are the ones making the claims

3904
03:15:42,600 --> 03:15:43,200
important.

3905
03:15:43,500 --> 03:15:45,800
He says it doesn't matter because I got a crew is the one

3906
03:15:45,800 --> 03:15:46,400
backing them.

3907
03:15:46,600 --> 03:15:49,800
So I got a question for dev and wick.

3908
03:15:50,300 --> 03:15:55,600
Okay, so so if you can if a single person cannot sue for

3909
03:15:55,600 --> 03:15:59,000
fraud in the 2020 election individually as a voter, why

3910
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,900
would they be able to sue in a primary to get somebody off

3911
03:16:01,900 --> 03:16:02,600
the ballot?

3912
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:05,700
Because they would have no standing either way.

3913
03:16:05,700 --> 03:16:07,600
It doesn't seem like they should be able to answer that

3914
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:09,100
question before you answer that question.

3915
03:16:09,100 --> 03:16:10,900
I'm sorry, can because it sounds like we're going on to a

3916
03:16:10,900 --> 03:16:11,500
different thing.

3917
03:16:11,500 --> 03:16:13,800
No, no, no, I was just like that just came into my head and

3918
03:16:13,800 --> 03:16:16,600
I was I wanted to get that out before I put there.

3919
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:20,000
I mean, yeah, what I recall is that in 2020 some of the

3920
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,100
lawsuits were thrown out for standing and the standing was

3921
03:16:22,100 --> 03:16:25,900
you can't have a random Joe just sue because it's like,

3922
03:16:25,900 --> 03:16:26,700
okay, that makes sense.

3923
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:28,700
And if it is equivalent, then I guess it would make sense

3924
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:29,200
here too.

3925
03:16:29,300 --> 03:16:31,700
Yeah, and the the answer is you can literally find a random

3926
03:16:31,700 --> 03:16:36,200
person as a as the front the front face to a lawsuit by a

3927
03:16:36,400 --> 03:16:37,300
large corporation.

3928
03:16:37,300 --> 03:16:40,100
That's why it doesn't matter who they find for this primary

3929
03:16:40,400 --> 03:16:42,400
issue is because they could literally just pay anybody to

3930
03:16:42,400 --> 03:16:42,800
do it.

3931
03:16:43,700 --> 03:16:48,200
I think so, but the court decided to hear the case the

3932
03:16:48,200 --> 03:16:52,800
correct which is the process of arguing it and writing out

3933
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:53,900
their opinion.

3934
03:16:54,300 --> 03:16:57,300
What about the actual merits of the case?

3935
03:16:57,500 --> 03:17:00,500
Are you do you say because I thought at the end of the day,

3936
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:01,300
this is the same problem.

3937
03:17:01,300 --> 03:17:04,400
I had when people were talking about the plagiarism things

3938
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:08,100
like oh a Republican brought that so we have to ignore that

3939
03:17:08,100 --> 03:17:10,400
and Republican brought that to the forefront.

3940
03:17:10,600 --> 03:17:11,700
I don't give a shit.

3941
03:17:11,900 --> 03:17:13,300
Are the allegations true?

3942
03:17:14,200 --> 03:17:16,600
Does the case have merit or does it not?

3943
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:20,200
I don't care about the message at the end of the day.

3944
03:17:20,900 --> 03:17:24,100
There's a mere ways with can we can we point out one thing

3945
03:17:24,100 --> 03:17:26,500
so that the crux of the disagreement least the one that

3946
03:17:26,500 --> 03:17:29,600
he brought to me in this conversation is he doesn't think

3947
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:30,500
it matters.

3948
03:17:30,600 --> 03:17:35,600
It doesn't it basically this is not a this is still a scheme

3949
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:38,900
by the left and the Democrats Republicans play no role in

3950
03:17:38,900 --> 03:17:42,600
this apparently no Republican challenges Donald Trump's

3951
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:45,900
eligibility under section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

3952
03:17:45,900 --> 03:17:50,400
It is purely Democrats and the left because he says that

3953
03:17:50,400 --> 03:17:53,100
the fact that Republicans are filing a suit doesn't matter

3954
03:17:53,100 --> 03:17:57,000
when they've got a left-leaning nonprofit behind them.

3955
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:58,600
Yeah, do you think it matters?

3956
03:17:58,600 --> 03:18:00,500
Well, first of all first of all Artemis.

3957
03:18:00,500 --> 03:18:03,000
Do you think that's a fair recounting of your position?

3958
03:18:04,600 --> 03:18:08,400
It's sort of because I can't remember what state Supreme

3959
03:18:08,400 --> 03:18:10,800
Court said it but they literally threw it out because

3960
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:13,600
of this because it was obviously a bid just to get somebody

3961
03:18:13,600 --> 03:18:14,800
removed off the ballot.

3962
03:18:15,800 --> 03:18:18,400
But that's what it was and I'm trying to figure out which

3963
03:18:18,400 --> 03:18:21,000
state it said it in so I can use it is it Michigan?

3964
03:18:22,400 --> 03:18:25,100
Yeah, Michigan said that because they pointed out that

3965
03:18:25,100 --> 03:18:27,900
they are literally a partisan organization that pushed

3966
03:18:27,900 --> 03:18:30,800
this specifically because that's why we have the Supreme

3967
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:33,900
Court to adjudicate and different court and that's where

3968
03:18:33,900 --> 03:18:35,600
it's going to go and that's why it's going to get struck

3969
03:18:35,600 --> 03:18:37,400
down because regardless of who took it up.

3970
03:18:37,400 --> 03:18:39,800
They never should have it's going to get wiped out.

3971
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:44,000
So Wick my question to you is is it possible for Republicans

3972
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,700
some Republicans in this country some conservatives in

3973
03:18:46,700 --> 03:18:50,400
this country to genuinely believe that Trump is ineligible

3974
03:18:50,400 --> 03:18:51,300
under the 14th.

3975
03:18:51,300 --> 03:18:53,400
I I know them right.

3976
03:18:53,400 --> 03:18:54,800
I know that that's the thing though.

3977
03:18:54,800 --> 03:18:55,500
I do like it.

3978
03:18:55,500 --> 03:18:58,900
The fact that both of you are asking me questions to snidely

3979
03:18:58,900 --> 03:19:02,900
well apparently apparently this is what do you think about

3980
03:19:02,900 --> 03:19:05,800
this and I'm going to frame my opponent's argument in the

3981
03:19:05,800 --> 03:19:06,500
worst way possible.

3982
03:19:06,500 --> 03:19:07,700
But no, I think it's fine.

3983
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:13,700
So Artemis is there so he believes that there are people

3984
03:19:13,700 --> 03:19:16,700
in this country conservatives and Republicans who do genuinely

3985
03:19:16,700 --> 03:19:20,100
believe Donald Trump is disqualified under the 14th Amendment,

3986
03:19:20,100 --> 03:19:21,200
which is my position.

3987
03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:22,400
Do you agree or disagree?

3988
03:19:22,500 --> 03:19:24,200
I think there's probably people out there that do.

3989
03:19:24,700 --> 03:19:27,800
Okay, and I don't see at this point what the beef is.

3990
03:19:27,800 --> 03:19:31,100
I think that we have gotten as asymptotically close to consensus

3991
03:19:31,100 --> 03:19:32,700
over who's behind this.

3992
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:36,100
I agree that certainly it would favor the Democrats this

3993
03:19:36,100 --> 03:19:38,900
particular outcome over the Republican Party in general.

3994
03:19:39,100 --> 03:19:43,300
My position is that these suits it does matter that Republican

3995
03:19:43,300 --> 03:19:46,400
voters are bringing the suit that I that it's not we don't

3996
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:49,900
have no evidence that their feelings are insincere or that

3997
03:19:49,900 --> 03:19:53,700
it's just some sort of elaborate scheme brew probably has

3998
03:19:53,700 --> 03:19:54,800
motivated reasoning.

3999
03:19:54,800 --> 03:19:56,700
They think Donald Trump is corrupt.

4000
03:19:56,700 --> 03:19:59,300
They probably also think he is ineligible under the 14th

4001
03:19:59,300 --> 03:20:02,400
Amendment and there are Republican and independent voters

4002
03:20:02,400 --> 03:20:03,500
who feel likewise.

4003
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:04,700
I think that matters.

4004
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,800
Let me hear let me let me give you a olive branch, right?

4005
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:12,600
If a organization that was without actually like actually

4006
03:20:12,600 --> 03:20:16,600
nonpartisan and didn't really have any backing from a obviously

4007
03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:20,600
partisan source brought this case and succeeded it would

4008
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:22,000
have a lot more way behind it.

4009
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:27,100
The problem is is that they chose a an organization that

4010
03:20:27,100 --> 03:20:29,800
was backed by Media Matters because it's ran by Media Matters

4011
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:33,600
the people from Media Matters in the organization is caused

4012
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:36,300
doubt to be produced in this court case.

4013
03:20:36,600 --> 03:20:38,200
And that is the issue you're going to run.

4014
03:20:38,200 --> 03:20:41,500
You're going to see this come into the Supreme Court case

4015
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:44,500
is that it's going to be pointed out but here the Artemis

4016
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:50,600
like I don't think I cannot think of a scenario where it

4017
03:20:50,600 --> 03:20:54,400
wouldn't cause a sizable portion of the Republican Party

4018
03:20:54,400 --> 03:20:57,400
to doubt the merits of it just simply based on the accusation.

4019
03:20:57,500 --> 03:21:01,100
I cannot think of any organization that brought this forward

4020
03:21:01,100 --> 03:21:02,800
like even if Liz Cheney, right?

4021
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:05,700
Remember when Liz Cheney and all those Republicans voted

4022
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:09,000
to impeach Trump and immediately they were decided all these

4023
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:10,000
are Republicans.

4024
03:21:10,100 --> 03:21:14,500
So what if a person just hired an attorney from a regular

4025
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:16,900
like lawyer's office and then did this?

4026
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:22,000
Yeah, I think that people would just be like like people

4027
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:24,400
would find there's no there's no can well meet they would

4028
03:21:24,400 --> 03:21:25,400
they would struggle.

4029
03:21:25,900 --> 03:21:28,000
It would be wouldn't be nearly as easy.

4030
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:30,700
It'd be really fucking hard.

4031
03:21:30,700 --> 03:21:31,700
I don't know if that's true.

4032
03:21:31,900 --> 03:21:33,900
I'm not I'm not sure what you yeah, I'm not sure what you

4033
03:21:33,900 --> 03:21:37,200
mean there out of curiosity since with brought up Liz Cheney

4034
03:21:38,600 --> 03:21:42,300
Liz Cheney recently came out and admitted or confirmed.

4035
03:21:42,600 --> 03:21:44,700
She thinks that Trump is disqualified under section 3

4036
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:45,700
of the 14th Amendment.

4037
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:46,300
Do you agree?

4038
03:21:46,500 --> 03:21:49,600
Like do you think that she's a you think that her beliefs

4039
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:50,300
are sincere?

4040
03:21:50,500 --> 03:21:51,800
No, well hold on.

4041
03:21:51,900 --> 03:21:54,500
I believe that she sincerely hates the man and probably

4042
03:21:54,600 --> 03:21:56,900
think so look she would believe it.

4043
03:21:57,400 --> 03:21:58,700
I don't doubt her beliefs.

4044
03:21:58,900 --> 03:22:00,600
I mean he shit all over her father.

4045
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:02,400
She has every reason to hate him.

4046
03:22:02,900 --> 03:22:05,000
So it would probably be colored in that way.

4047
03:22:05,500 --> 03:22:07,600
You think it's possible that she let's say she hates him

4048
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:10,400
you think it's possible it's because of his actions not

4049
03:22:10,400 --> 03:22:12,600
because he insulted her father.

4050
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:17,600
I there's no way to tell that that would be a mens rea

4051
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:20,600
thing and I will you just speculate it as to her men's

4052
03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:22,700
rail. No, no, she definitely hates him.

4053
03:22:23,600 --> 03:22:26,400
She she sacrificed her seat as a hold on.

4054
03:22:26,400 --> 03:22:30,500
She sacrificed her seat as a congressperson to destroy him

4055
03:22:30,500 --> 03:22:33,100
in the January 6th thing that she dedicated herself to

4056
03:22:33,100 --> 03:22:36,200
that. She said I am going to destroy him off the get him

4057
03:22:36,200 --> 03:22:36,800
off the ballot.

4058
03:22:37,500 --> 03:22:40,300
You were willing to speculate that the reason was because

4059
03:22:40,300 --> 03:22:42,600
he insulted Dick Cheney her father.

4060
03:22:42,700 --> 03:22:45,500
So you were happy to speculate that that was the reason

4061
03:22:45,500 --> 03:22:46,000
correct.

4062
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:50,300
I'm asking you is it possible that maybe let me try it

4063
03:22:50,300 --> 03:22:51,800
conservative ahead.

4064
03:22:51,800 --> 03:22:52,700
Let me try it this way.

4065
03:22:53,600 --> 03:22:54,800
Someone joins the military.

4066
03:22:55,400 --> 03:22:58,400
They go off to the foreign country and they fight the war

4067
03:22:58,700 --> 03:23:01,700
and they kill a bunch of the enemy, right?

4068
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:05,800
Do they do that because they love their country and want

4069
03:23:05,800 --> 03:23:08,700
to put their lives on the line and destroy its enemies or

4070
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:10,900
are they doing that because they hate those people and

4071
03:23:10,900 --> 03:23:12,200
want to kill those people?

4072
03:23:13,400 --> 03:23:16,100
I think it's I think it's slightly different reasoning

4073
03:23:16,100 --> 03:23:19,900
because because Liz Cheney hated Trump before January 6th.

4074
03:23:20,400 --> 03:23:21,200
No, she did not.

4075
03:23:21,300 --> 03:23:23,300
She oh, she definitely fucking did.

4076
03:23:23,300 --> 03:23:24,600
I don't know where she didn't.

4077
03:23:25,200 --> 03:23:28,000
They are what do you think they are several indications

4078
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,000
that she said you think it matters?

4079
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:31,100
Do you think it matters?

4080
03:23:31,100 --> 03:23:32,100
Let me let me ask you this.

4081
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:38,200
How a congressperson Haves or how they vote.

4082
03:23:38,200 --> 03:23:41,200
Do you think these are reflections of support or opposition?

4083
03:23:43,800 --> 03:23:45,100
Vice can you say that again?

4084
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:49,200
Do you think how a congressperson any congressperson Democrat

4085
03:23:49,200 --> 03:23:49,900
Republican?

4086
03:23:49,900 --> 03:23:54,100
It doesn't matter how they behave who they support and

4087
03:23:54,100 --> 03:23:55,000
how they vote.

4088
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:56,200
Do you think these things matter?

4089
03:23:57,800 --> 03:24:04,200
Yes, for the most part you voted with Donald Trump 93% of

4090
03:24:04,200 --> 03:24:07,500
the time higher than Jim Jordan higher than Mike Johnson.

4091
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:09,400
She put her money where her mouth was.

4092
03:24:09,400 --> 03:24:11,000
She voted for him in 2016.

4093
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:14,200
She voted for him in 2020 and when she served in Congress

4094
03:24:14,200 --> 03:24:18,600
while he was president 93 times out of a hundred she backed

4095
03:24:18,600 --> 03:24:19,600
his legislation.

4096
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:23,000
It was one of the highest Republican ratings while Trump

4097
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:23,800
was in office.

4098
03:24:24,200 --> 03:24:27,800
She was a dutiful soldier until January 6th.

4099
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:30,000
Well, I said hold on go ahead.

4100
03:24:30,200 --> 03:24:33,700
Okay, so we have the voting part of that right you said

4101
03:24:33,700 --> 03:24:36,400
there was two other things right how they conduct themselves

4102
03:24:36,400 --> 03:24:39,700
and how they I can't what was the other one and how they

4103
03:24:39,700 --> 03:24:41,800
vote how they vote how they conduct themselves who they

4104
03:24:41,800 --> 03:24:46,200
support so so Liz Cheney did not support Donald Trump at

4105
03:24:46,200 --> 03:24:49,400
all in terms of outside of voting, right?

4106
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:52,400
She's a definitely a log cabinet Republican.

4107
03:24:52,800 --> 03:24:56,200
She she's made her statements clear that so outside of the

4108
03:24:56,200 --> 03:24:58,400
one way of support that actually matters.

4109
03:24:58,500 --> 03:24:59,300
She didn't okay.

4110
03:24:59,300 --> 03:25:00,200
So, okay.

4111
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:03,900
Well, here's the issue right most of Trump's legislation

4112
03:25:03,900 --> 03:25:05,700
wasn't created by Trump.

4113
03:25:05,700 --> 03:25:08,400
It was created by other Republicans right was going to get

4114
03:25:08,400 --> 03:25:09,300
the credit for it.

4115
03:25:09,700 --> 03:25:14,200
I mean from I guess no, it's not it's listen.

4116
03:25:14,600 --> 03:25:15,700
This is this is the beef.

4117
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:19,400
It's not an I guess when legislation passes under the

4118
03:25:19,500 --> 03:25:21,600
it's the president who gets the credit.

4119
03:25:21,700 --> 03:25:23,600
That's just how our politics works.

4120
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:26,000
Whether whether that's right or wrong and you could easily

4121
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:28,000
make the argument that once you get to the nuts and bolts

4122
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:30,200
as wrong, that's how it works.

4123
03:25:30,600 --> 03:25:35,300
She backed Trump's legislation 93% of the time more than

4124
03:25:35,300 --> 03:25:38,600
the vast majority of not just Congress, but even fellow

4125
03:25:38,600 --> 03:25:43,000
Republicans she voted for him for president twice.

4126
03:25:43,500 --> 03:25:47,400
What do you have prior to January 6th to indicate her strong

4127
03:25:47,400 --> 03:25:51,900
opposition that would that is meaningfully counterweights

4128
03:25:51,900 --> 03:25:53,500
what we just described.

4129
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:54,300
Okay.

4130
03:25:55,500 --> 03:26:00,200
When did Trump call Dick Cheney?

4131
03:26:02,200 --> 03:26:04,500
A loser or is it coward?

4132
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:12,000
Let's see.

4133
03:26:12,100 --> 03:26:14,400
Was it now that seems way too.

4134
03:26:14,400 --> 03:26:16,000
Are you sure you're not thinking of John McCain?

4135
03:26:16,400 --> 03:26:17,100
Was it McCain?

4136
03:26:17,200 --> 03:26:18,300
Trump called a lot of people.

4137
03:26:18,300 --> 03:26:19,200
It was McCain.

4138
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:19,700
Not yet.

4139
03:26:19,700 --> 03:26:20,700
It was John McCain.

4140
03:26:20,700 --> 03:26:23,800
Not, you know, not Cheney, but but to be fair.

4141
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:28,200
It's an easy mistake to make as Trump has said a lot of bad

4142
03:26:28,200 --> 03:26:29,200
shit about a lot.

4143
03:26:29,200 --> 03:26:29,700
They're both.

4144
03:26:29,700 --> 03:26:33,000
I think I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that he he also shit on

4145
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:33,500
like that.

4146
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:35,600
It's just possible.

4147
03:26:35,600 --> 03:26:37,500
He might have he he should have a lot of people.

4148
03:26:37,500 --> 03:26:38,000
Let's be honest.

4149
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:39,500
Yeah, he did.

4150
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:40,700
No, I'm pretty sure.

4151
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:41,000
Yeah.

4152
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:45,300
I think this is a mix-up because I know Megan McCain after

4153
03:26:45,300 --> 03:26:47,100
her dad got shit on by Trump.

4154
03:26:47,300 --> 03:26:50,000
She like immediately turned on Trump and she did so long

4155
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:52,200
before January 6th, right?

4156
03:26:52,500 --> 03:26:53,600
Yeah, absolutely.

4157
03:26:54,700 --> 03:26:56,900
That is not my recollection of Liz Cheney.

4158
03:26:56,900 --> 03:27:00,100
Liz Cheney was a dutiful soldier with her with how she voted

4159
03:27:00,100 --> 03:27:04,600
as a member of Congress in 2000 2016 to 2020 almost most

4160
03:27:04,600 --> 03:27:08,500
definitely and again to the reason I brought it up is because

4161
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:12,900
her and the other Republicans were immediately cast out and

4162
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:17,300
Immediately castigated as never Trumpers as all rhinos.

4163
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:21,200
She was the third in command of the House Republican Conference.

4164
03:27:21,200 --> 03:27:23,900
She had a job that currently Elise Stefanik has.

4165
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:28,400
She was censured by the Republican Party as a result of

4166
03:27:28,400 --> 03:27:30,900
her opposition to Trump post January 6th.

4167
03:27:31,900 --> 03:27:33,500
So no, I listen.

4168
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:36,000
I'm not saying that that means you have to accept the merits.

4169
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:39,200
It's entirely possible that there is a relatively bipartisan

4170
03:27:39,200 --> 03:27:42,000
coalition of anti Trumpers and that doesn't mean you're obligated

4171
03:27:42,400 --> 03:27:43,500
Believe that they're right.

4172
03:27:43,600 --> 03:27:47,200
I'm just telling you it is a fact and it is a fact that

4173
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:48,500
it's not just Democrats.

4174
03:27:48,700 --> 03:27:52,500
It is mostly Democrats, but there is a sizable portion of

4175
03:27:52,500 --> 03:27:56,800
lifelong conservatives and former Republican officials who

4176
03:27:56,800 --> 03:28:01,600
despise the man and for legitimate reasons, not just because

4177
03:28:01,600 --> 03:28:04,600
he insulted their dads last word Artemis and I'd like to

4178
03:28:04,600 --> 03:28:07,700
have this in a more long form, but I know that actually

4179
03:28:07,700 --> 03:28:10,800
yeah, cuz I wanted to talk about the January 6th committee.

4180
03:28:10,800 --> 03:28:15,100
Yeah, so Artemis and I you and I've been I've been talking

4181
03:28:15,100 --> 03:28:16,900
for like a week now with the January 6th committee.

4182
03:28:16,900 --> 03:28:20,200
And yeah, yeah, they've been some fun conversation.

4183
03:28:20,200 --> 03:28:20,600
How about this?

4184
03:28:20,600 --> 03:28:23,700
How about this next week next week?

4185
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:25,800
I have I'm putting my schedule together.

4186
03:28:25,900 --> 03:28:28,700
You guys tell me when you can make it and I'll say some time

4187
03:28:28,700 --> 03:28:30,000
and we can do the January 6th.

4188
03:28:30,600 --> 03:28:32,700
I am procrastinating right now.

4189
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:34,800
Like you wouldn't believe we're all here.

4190
03:28:34,800 --> 03:28:36,800
Let's just chat for like half an hour.

4191
03:28:36,800 --> 03:28:37,800
Let's just like listen.

4192
03:28:37,800 --> 03:28:39,100
Yeah, I got hungry.

4193
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:42,300
I got whoever is under you don't have to do you just be

4194
03:28:42,300 --> 03:28:44,100
here. Hold on.

4195
03:28:44,100 --> 03:28:44,300
Hold on.

4196
03:28:44,300 --> 03:28:47,000
I've got it here.

4197
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:49,200
We can TLDR really quick.

4198
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:52,200
So basically Artemis you and I were arguing you are just

4199
03:28:52,200 --> 03:28:54,000
let me know if I'm if I'm mischaracterizing you.

4200
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:58,900
Okay, you think the January 6th committee is not valid for

4201
03:28:58,900 --> 03:29:01,700
two reasons as far as I understand, right?

4202
03:29:01,900 --> 03:29:04,900
And one reason is because it was it was based.

4203
03:29:04,900 --> 03:29:07,000
Well, first of all, one reason is because evidence from it

4204
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:11,600
was destroyed and the second reason is because there were

4205
03:29:11,600 --> 03:29:14,900
no Republicans on the committee or they were there like Rhinos

4206
03:29:14,900 --> 03:29:17,800
on the committee and not actually McCarthy's five picks,

4207
03:29:17,800 --> 03:29:18,100
right?

4208
03:29:18,100 --> 03:29:19,100
Was it those two reasons?

4209
03:29:19,100 --> 03:29:21,900
I would actually say that Liz Cheney and the other guy were

4210
03:29:21,900 --> 03:29:24,600
probably more Republican than the actual Republican Party

4211
03:29:24,600 --> 03:29:25,100
is now.

4212
03:29:25,600 --> 03:29:26,000
Okay.

4213
03:29:27,200 --> 03:29:30,500
The issue is you can't call Liz Cheney a rhino because

4214
03:29:30,500 --> 03:29:33,500
Republicans were stood for blood and mine oil.

4215
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:35,200
Like okay, no fair enough.

4216
03:29:35,200 --> 03:29:37,300
They would go to fuck up every other country.

4217
03:29:37,300 --> 03:29:38,200
There was here.

4218
03:29:38,500 --> 03:29:41,600
I'll rephrase there were no like Pro Trump positions on

4219
03:29:41,600 --> 03:29:42,100
the panel.

4220
03:29:42,100 --> 03:29:43,500
No populist types.

4221
03:29:43,500 --> 03:29:43,900
Yeah.

4222
03:29:44,100 --> 03:29:48,400
Yeah, and so therefore because Jim Jordan who's the most

4223
03:29:48,400 --> 03:29:53,400
notorious for I'm gonna get drink keep talking cross-examining

4224
03:29:53,400 --> 03:29:57,100
witnesses was not allowed on there is one of the biggest

4225
03:29:57,100 --> 03:30:00,200
things and so when you and I argued about this I said well,

4226
03:30:00,200 --> 03:30:03,300
it was because Jim Jordan was one of the guys being investigated

4227
03:30:03,300 --> 03:30:03,900
by the panel.

4228
03:30:03,900 --> 03:30:06,400
So it would be inappropriate for him to sit on the panel

4229
03:30:06,400 --> 03:30:08,400
investigating the event when he was part of the event.

4230
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:13,200
Yeah, and I and I criticized that because the the the the

4231
03:30:13,200 --> 03:30:17,600
panel the J6 Commission didn't exist to do to state that

4232
03:30:17,600 --> 03:30:20,000
they're investigating in before that decision was made.

4233
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:23,300
So yeah, so it was yeah, so so so your view from what I

4234
03:30:23,300 --> 03:30:25,400
understand is that it's that that's post hoc reasoning.

4235
03:30:25,400 --> 03:30:28,700
It's like how did we know that Jim Jordan was involved in

4236
03:30:28,700 --> 03:30:31,200
the situation before the panel was put together?

4237
03:30:31,200 --> 03:30:35,100
So when Nancy Pelosi rejects Jim Jordan as a pick, how

4238
03:30:35,100 --> 03:30:37,500
did she know that he was inappropriate to sit on the panel

4239
03:30:37,500 --> 03:30:39,700
because the panel hadn't discovered anything yet because

4240
03:30:39,700 --> 03:30:42,200
there's no evidence of her reasoning.

4241
03:30:42,200 --> 03:30:44,200
I mean if she if she had it she should have posted at

4242
03:30:44,200 --> 03:30:48,900
the time right and my view on that is basically that Nancy

4243
03:30:48,900 --> 03:30:52,900
Pelosi is this cutthroat lifelong politician who probably

4244
03:30:52,900 --> 03:30:56,500
has her finger in every single pie in Washington DC and

4245
03:30:56,500 --> 03:30:59,900
there is no way she didn't know beforehand that Jim Jordan's

4246
03:30:59,900 --> 03:31:01,400
name was going to come up in this committee.

4247
03:31:02,100 --> 03:31:04,800
Well, I believe if because you got to remember that there

4248
03:31:04,800 --> 03:31:08,400
was evidence and you know, just due to the the reporting

4249
03:31:08,400 --> 03:31:09,100
of the event.

4250
03:31:09,100 --> 03:31:13,300
I'd have to go back to the timeline but there were I'm almost

4251
03:31:13,300 --> 03:31:17,500
certain allegations of Jim Jordan's impropriety with respect

4252
03:31:17,500 --> 03:31:20,200
to Trump's schemes to overthrow the election prior to the

4253
03:31:20,200 --> 03:31:24,200
formation of the January 6 select committee me and if unless

4254
03:31:24,200 --> 03:31:28,100
I'm wrong it's possible, but I doubt it that means that

4255
03:31:28,100 --> 03:31:31,100
she had a sufficient predicate to think that Jim Jordan

4256
03:31:31,100 --> 03:31:35,900
may be materially relevant to the the scope of the investigation.

4257
03:31:35,900 --> 03:31:37,700
I think that's a fair assumption to me.

4258
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:40,500
So here's the thing if that's true though because Artemis

4259
03:31:40,500 --> 03:31:42,100
and I went through this if that's true.

4260
03:31:42,100 --> 03:31:44,500
She didn't say it at all because we went searching for

4261
03:31:44,500 --> 03:31:47,900
like what did Nancy Pelosi say before the January 6 or

4262
03:31:47,900 --> 03:31:50,900
he was formed we went looking and the only thing she said

4263
03:31:50,900 --> 03:31:54,100
is she just said I think he's inappropriate his actions

4264
03:31:54,100 --> 03:31:54,700
in his comments.

4265
03:31:54,700 --> 03:31:57,700
She was very vague about it and I can only point to the

4266
03:31:57,700 --> 03:32:00,900
Fox News nighttime things where he was on there talking

4267
03:32:00,900 --> 03:32:04,900
about it about the what he said to the president and that

4268
03:32:04,900 --> 03:32:05,200
was it.

4269
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:06,200
Right, right.

4270
03:32:06,200 --> 03:32:08,900
And I think that's some of the the evidence I'm thinking

4271
03:32:08,900 --> 03:32:11,300
of because I remember people asking him and there were a

4272
03:32:11,300 --> 03:32:13,600
couple of awkward interviews like did you hey, did you ever

4273
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:17,700
talk to Donald Trump on January 6 and he's like why me?

4274
03:32:17,700 --> 03:32:19,800
I talked I talked to the president all the time.

4275
03:32:19,800 --> 03:32:21,200
It's a great moment.

4276
03:32:21,200 --> 03:32:22,000
I saw that.

4277
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:25,600
Yeah, the big issue is is that oh, no, go ahead.

4278
03:32:25,600 --> 03:32:25,900
Sorry.

4279
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:28,900
No, I was just gonna say and by the way Artemis kidding

4280
03:32:28,900 --> 03:32:31,100
aside and this is why I didn't have a problem with this

4281
03:32:31,100 --> 03:32:34,000
earlier. I like throwing elbows and we can tell you that

4282
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:34,500
was fun.

4283
03:32:34,500 --> 03:32:37,800
I love yeah, I love going off on lactoid and back and forth.

4284
03:32:37,800 --> 03:32:42,600
Yeah, so so I don't I don't I miss the Bloodsport days when

4285
03:32:42,600 --> 03:32:46,600
I was actually known on the internet right now.

4286
03:32:46,600 --> 03:32:49,900
You're known for being an Irish teen genius who so yeah,

4287
03:32:49,900 --> 03:32:51,800
yeah, it was a horrible movie.

4288
03:32:51,800 --> 03:32:54,500
Oh, but without revealing this without revealing the secret

4289
03:32:54,500 --> 03:32:57,000
Artemis had a different name black back in the Bloodsport

4290
03:32:57,000 --> 03:32:59,700
days and he had a name for himself back then which he abandoned

4291
03:32:59,700 --> 03:33:00,700
a large man.

4292
03:33:01,100 --> 03:33:01,700
Oh God.

4293
03:33:01,700 --> 03:33:02,100
Okay.

4294
03:33:02,100 --> 03:33:02,400
All right.

4295
03:33:02,400 --> 03:33:04,400
Well, I do not want to know.

4296
03:33:04,400 --> 03:33:05,600
I'm just popping off.

4297
03:33:05,700 --> 03:33:07,300
I'm just good reason YouTube.

4298
03:33:07,300 --> 03:33:08,100
I don't want to know.

4299
03:33:10,500 --> 03:33:10,800
Go ahead.

4300
03:33:10,800 --> 03:33:11,500
Go keep going.

4301
03:33:11,500 --> 03:33:13,800
I was just gonna say I was just gonna say so in conclusion

4302
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:19,000
I would offer as a as a counter proposition to to to your

4303
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:23,600
point that that Pelosi never gave reason explicitly maybe

4304
03:33:23,800 --> 03:33:26,200
she felt it would have been inappropriate to kind of like

4305
03:33:26,200 --> 03:33:29,400
precast Jim Jordan's going to be under investigation.

4306
03:33:29,900 --> 03:33:32,100
I'm not saying that that's the right way to handle it.

4307
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:34,000
But that I that makes sense to me.

4308
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:37,900
So so do you know Eric Swalwell is do okay.

4309
03:33:37,900 --> 03:33:41,600
Do you remember what the big what the big committees he

4310
03:33:41,600 --> 03:33:46,000
was on? I believe it was oversight and Judiciary wasn't

4311
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:49,200
it? I thought it was like intelligence right as well House

4312
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:50,900
and tell there is a House Intelligence Committee.

4313
03:33:50,900 --> 03:33:54,600
Yeah, and he was on there in his his his fling with a suspected

4314
03:33:54,600 --> 03:33:55,400
Chinese pie.

4315
03:33:55,700 --> 03:33:55,900
Yeah.

4316
03:33:55,900 --> 03:33:59,400
So when they didn't remove him from an obvious relationship

4317
03:33:59,400 --> 03:34:05,900
with a spy Chinese by that never like that that was confirmed

4318
03:34:05,900 --> 03:34:08,400
a relationship at a for a period of time doesn't really

4319
03:34:08,400 --> 03:34:11,800
matter how long or like they didn't get into what they discussed

4320
03:34:11,800 --> 03:34:14,800
at all, but that in and of itself they never removed him

4321
03:34:14,800 --> 03:34:17,200
from that committee at all during that period of time.

4322
03:34:18,200 --> 03:34:22,300
So I would I would want to go back and fact-check the details

4323
03:34:22,300 --> 03:34:25,100
of that because number one, I don't know if it was ever confirmed

4324
03:34:25,100 --> 03:34:29,700
that she was a spy number two the extent and the timeline

4325
03:34:29,700 --> 03:34:34,000
of the involvement probably does matter but note that they

4326
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:38,400
didn't kick they didn't kick Jim Jordan out of the House

4327
03:34:38,400 --> 03:34:40,900
Judiciary Committee or how to vet of anything else.

4328
03:34:40,900 --> 03:34:44,300
They just said that he couldn't be on this specific subcommittee

4329
03:34:44,300 --> 03:34:47,800
and I do think that's different than kicking somebody off

4330
03:34:47,800 --> 03:34:50,200
a committee on which they already are.

4331
03:34:50,200 --> 03:34:51,200
I do think that's different.

4332
03:34:51,200 --> 03:34:54,900
I don't know if Peng Feng or Christina Feng or whatever

4333
03:34:54,900 --> 03:34:58,800
her name is was ever confirmed 100% but almost by the way,

4334
03:34:58,800 --> 03:34:59,500
I just want to clarify.

4335
03:34:59,500 --> 03:35:01,900
I don't think I do think that that merits investigation.

4336
03:35:01,900 --> 03:35:03,900
I'm not saying that that means that that you give them a

4337
03:35:03,900 --> 03:35:04,700
blank check.

4338
03:35:04,700 --> 03:35:07,200
So normally what happens in an investigation?

4339
03:35:07,200 --> 03:35:11,500
I have a top secret clearance secure compartmentalized

4340
03:35:11,500 --> 03:35:15,000
information one whenever you're on investigation for security

4341
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:18,300
issues, you lose your clearance temporarily and you're

4342
03:35:18,300 --> 03:35:22,800
removed from any jobs related to that until the investigation

4343
03:35:22,800 --> 03:35:25,000
is over that is a normal process.

4344
03:35:25,000 --> 03:35:30,200
So when they didn't do that and he sits on classified boards

4345
03:35:30,200 --> 03:35:32,600
and briefings still during that period of time.

4346
03:35:32,600 --> 03:35:36,200
He wasn't removed until the Republicans took over and he

4347
03:35:36,200 --> 03:35:37,400
was denied his seat again.

4348
03:35:38,400 --> 03:35:41,600
So right, so he was yes, he was removed from the committee

4349
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:44,100
once the majority change hands a couple of things.

4350
03:35:44,100 --> 03:35:46,700
I'll say again because because you have me at a disadvantage

4351
03:35:46,700 --> 03:35:49,100
here in the sense that I'm not intimately familiar with the

4352
03:35:49,100 --> 03:35:52,200
story except the broad strokes number one.

4353
03:35:52,200 --> 03:35:56,300
I don't think the house has anything to do with top secret

4354
03:35:56,300 --> 03:35:58,000
clearance in the sense that I don't think they're the ones

4355
03:35:58,000 --> 03:35:58,500
who give it.

4356
03:35:58,500 --> 03:35:59,100
I think that's all.

4357
03:35:59,100 --> 03:36:00,100
No, no, they receive it.

4358
03:36:00,700 --> 03:36:01,000
Right.

4359
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:03,600
That's on there that he would be executive.

4360
03:36:03,900 --> 03:36:05,100
Yeah, I'm the executive branch.

4361
03:36:05,100 --> 03:36:06,200
So I agree.

4362
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:09,100
What I'm saying is that's not Pelosi's call to make that

4363
03:36:09,100 --> 03:36:12,200
would have been that would have been the relevant executive

4364
03:36:12,200 --> 03:36:13,100
branch agency.

4365
03:36:13,400 --> 03:36:16,600
I think actually would be well losing these clearance would

4366
03:36:16,600 --> 03:36:20,200
be an executive right, but removing it from that community

4367
03:36:20,200 --> 03:36:21,400
would be her decision.

4368
03:36:21,500 --> 03:36:22,900
That would have been her call.

4369
03:36:22,900 --> 03:36:23,500
Yes.

4370
03:36:24,000 --> 03:36:28,000
So what I'm saying is I would need to know more about what

4371
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:30,700
steps if any were taken and what the rationale was but I

4372
03:36:30,700 --> 03:36:33,900
could conceive of a situation where it's like listen, she's

4373
03:36:33,900 --> 03:36:35,000
a suspected spy.

4374
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:38,000
It doesn't look good, but we have no real evidence to suggest

4375
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:40,800
that you had engaged in any acts of impropriety.

4376
03:36:40,800 --> 03:36:43,700
So we're not going to remove you from a committee on which

4377
03:36:43,700 --> 03:36:46,200
you already are in contrast.

4378
03:36:46,600 --> 03:36:48,600
Pelosi could have been saying based on reports.

4379
03:36:48,600 --> 03:36:53,100
We do have some evidence to indicate that Jim Jordan was

4380
03:36:53,100 --> 03:36:56,700
involved in whatever Trump was up to up to legal or illegal

4381
03:36:56,700 --> 03:36:58,500
whatever but the subject of the investment.

4382
03:36:58,500 --> 03:37:02,300
Let me put you like this reason Eric Swalwell if there was

4383
03:37:02,300 --> 03:37:06,700
an investigation into Eric Swalwell's mistress, Eric Swalwell

4384
03:37:06,700 --> 03:37:08,000
should not be on that committee.

4385
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:09,600
If he's on the committee, he should be removed.

4386
03:37:09,600 --> 03:37:11,500
If he wasn't on it in the first place, he should never be

4387
03:37:11,500 --> 03:37:12,100
put on it.

4388
03:37:12,400 --> 03:37:15,800
That's what I think more comparable what happened with Jim

4389
03:37:15,800 --> 03:37:20,100
Jordan. In this case, Jim Jordan's Chinese mistress was Donald

4390
03:37:20,100 --> 03:37:25,000
Trump. And so I think the issue would go to okay.

4391
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:30,200
Well, I look at the details if you want them.

4392
03:37:30,900 --> 03:37:38,200
So so basically Christine Fang she had been since 2012 cultivating

4393
03:37:38,200 --> 03:37:42,300
contacts with politicians in California that the Chinese

4394
03:37:42,300 --> 03:37:46,200
government had had believed would one.

4395
03:37:46,200 --> 03:37:46,600
Yeah.

4396
03:37:46,900 --> 03:37:50,000
Well, so they independently found something from the Chinese

4397
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:52,400
government saying that China taken took an interest in a

4398
03:37:52,400 --> 03:37:57,100
list of Californian politicians and swallow was on the list.

4399
03:37:57,100 --> 03:38:00,100
And then this woman Christine Fang shows up and starts getting

4400
03:38:00,100 --> 03:38:02,400
heavily involved out of nowhere starts getting heavily involved

4401
03:38:02,400 --> 03:38:03,300
in his campaign.

4402
03:38:03,500 --> 03:38:06,600
She was also cultivating contacts with everyone else on that

4403
03:38:06,600 --> 03:38:09,500
list. So they didn't really they didn't get her on being a

4404
03:38:09,500 --> 03:38:12,200
spy, but she was doing all the things that a spy would do

4405
03:38:12,200 --> 03:38:14,100
based on the document they got from the Chinese.

4406
03:38:14,100 --> 03:38:17,500
She also fled to an embassy and then got you know, which

4407
03:38:17,500 --> 03:38:18,200
yeah then left.

4408
03:38:18,400 --> 03:38:19,200
Yeah, the return of China.

4409
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:21,500
Yeah, so probably probably a spy probably a spy.

4410
03:38:21,600 --> 03:38:27,000
So what happened was she participated in his campaign in

4411
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:33,900
2014, but in 2015 US intelligence briefed him about

4412
03:38:33,900 --> 03:38:37,400
possible spies and then Swalwell said oh shit.

4413
03:38:37,400 --> 03:38:41,200
She's probably a spy and then cut contact with her and it

4414
03:38:41,200 --> 03:38:45,500
turns out that Fang didn't even get any documents or any

4415
03:38:45,500 --> 03:38:48,800
information from him during that time that that because

4416
03:38:48,800 --> 03:38:51,500
here's the thing she was involved in his campaign, but

4417
03:38:51,500 --> 03:38:54,200
she was not involved with him after he got elected and

4418
03:38:54,200 --> 03:38:56,700
no information was leaked to her during during their

4419
03:38:56,800 --> 03:38:59,800
hold and I thought the story was I thought he'd been sleeping

4420
03:38:59,800 --> 03:39:01,500
with this Chinese chick who is taking.

4421
03:39:01,500 --> 03:39:04,500
I thought he might have been well, here's the thing they

4422
03:39:04,500 --> 03:39:05,400
discovered it.

4423
03:39:05,700 --> 03:39:07,100
Well, maybe he slept with her.

4424
03:39:07,700 --> 03:39:10,900
Well, they discovered they discovered that she had been

4425
03:39:10,900 --> 03:39:13,500
sleeping with at least two of her other contacts that she

4426
03:39:13,500 --> 03:39:16,500
had developed but not necessarily him.

4427
03:39:16,800 --> 03:39:20,200
So so if you wait, hold on Artemis, you said he admitted

4428
03:39:20,200 --> 03:39:20,900
to sleeping with her.

4429
03:39:20,900 --> 03:39:21,900
Is that true or not?

4430
03:39:22,300 --> 03:39:24,500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's true that he said that because

4431
03:39:25,500 --> 03:39:30,700
we can find that cats it has sexual relationships with two

4432
03:39:30,700 --> 03:39:34,100
unidentified Miss Midwestern mayors, but not with Swalwell

4433
03:39:34,600 --> 03:39:36,000
though allegations persisted.

4434
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:38,200
He was a national security threat by being associated with

4435
03:39:38,200 --> 03:39:44,000
her. So I think it's because I think it's because they did

4436
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:46,000
investigate him and they discovered that nothing was actually

4437
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:46,400
leaked.

4438
03:39:46,400 --> 03:39:50,100
So they just kind of let it be but I'm sure if they discovered

4439
03:39:50,100 --> 03:39:51,900
oh, he's actually compromised.

4440
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:53,800
They probably would have taken him off that committee and

4441
03:39:53,800 --> 03:39:54,500
rightfully so.

4442
03:39:54,500 --> 03:39:58,400
Yeah, cuz here it says that Saul refuses to say if he had

4443
03:39:58,400 --> 03:40:01,900
sex with Fang Fang claiming it's a matter of national security

4444
03:40:01,900 --> 03:40:04,000
not that he could share any details of their relationship.

4445
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:06,800
No, the fact that her name is Fang Fang is like a James Bond

4446
03:40:06,800 --> 03:40:07,300
movie, dude.

4447
03:40:07,300 --> 03:40:07,800
It's great.

4448
03:40:07,800 --> 03:40:10,800
Well, they say they say Fang is one.

4449
03:40:10,900 --> 03:40:12,600
You guys remember I'm going to make a racist joke.

4450
03:40:12,800 --> 03:40:16,500
You guys remember the this isn't even a joke.

4451
03:40:16,500 --> 03:40:17,200
This is a true story.

4452
03:40:17,900 --> 03:40:22,900
The Chinese jet who rammed an American spy plane back in

4453
03:40:22,900 --> 03:40:26,600
1999 2000 that kind of air vaguely vaguely recall this.

4454
03:40:26,600 --> 03:40:28,500
I think yeah, the pilot's name.

4455
03:40:28,500 --> 03:40:28,900
I shit.

4456
03:40:28,900 --> 03:40:31,100
You not was a long way.

4457
03:40:35,600 --> 03:40:38,700
So let me ask you Artemis because I'm doing some last minute

4458
03:40:38,700 --> 03:40:39,700
Google food here.

4459
03:40:39,700 --> 03:40:40,200
Go for it.

4460
03:40:40,900 --> 03:40:42,500
And that was also not a racist joke.

4461
03:40:42,500 --> 03:40:45,600
That was just a come through reference to just just make

4462
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:46,300
the racist jokes.

4463
03:40:46,300 --> 03:40:46,900
It's okay.

4464
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:48,200
No, no listening.

4465
03:40:48,200 --> 03:40:49,400
I'm popped again.

4466
03:40:49,400 --> 03:40:52,600
I can't I will not compromise my trajectory with that

4467
03:40:52,600 --> 03:40:54,200
shenaniganry true.

4468
03:40:54,400 --> 03:41:04,800
So does it does it matter to you that so according to Wikipedia

4469
03:41:04,800 --> 03:41:11,300
Destiny's favorite source on in May late like mid-may 2019

4470
03:41:11,300 --> 03:41:13,400
or excuse me, May 19th 2021.

4471
03:41:13,400 --> 03:41:16,200
That was when they decided to drop it, right?

4472
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:19,700
No, that was when they decided to form the house January 6

4473
03:41:19,700 --> 03:41:20,400
select committee.

4474
03:41:20,500 --> 03:41:26,000
Yeah about May 19th 2021 the matter to you that in March

4475
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:32,800
2021 Kevin McCarthy went he tried to remove Eric Swalwell

4476
03:41:33,200 --> 03:41:36,800
the House Intelligence Committee by passing a resolution.

4477
03:41:37,400 --> 03:41:42,100
So for context he they tried to move to remove Eric Swalwell

4478
03:41:42,100 --> 03:41:46,300
from that committee two months before the committee the

4479
03:41:46,300 --> 03:41:49,000
separate committee the the house January 6 select committee

4480
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:54,000
was launched from which Jim Jordan was rejected.

4481
03:41:54,000 --> 03:41:57,000
So actually it was Kevin McCarthy who made the first attempt

4482
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:57,500
to move.

4483
03:41:58,000 --> 03:42:02,500
So the the statement by McCarthy was because a person that

4484
03:42:02,500 --> 03:42:08,400
had relations with a quote-unquote spy a clear issue with

4485
03:42:09,400 --> 03:42:13,400
having holding a class AA clearance on the House Intelligence

4486
03:42:13,400 --> 03:42:19,900
Committee that is the the stuff there as a as a leap of logic

4487
03:42:19,900 --> 03:42:21,400
is almost non-existent.

4488
03:42:21,400 --> 03:42:23,900
You could just you could easily see why somebody would have

4489
03:42:23,900 --> 03:42:26,700
an issue with somebody being on the committee, right, but

4490
03:42:26,700 --> 03:42:28,800
I would argue the same I would argue.

4491
03:42:28,800 --> 03:42:32,700
I don't know where where it measures but I think that you

4492
03:42:32,700 --> 03:42:35,900
could easily make the case for Jim Jordan given what we knew

4493
03:42:35,900 --> 03:42:39,400
about Jim Jordan's relationship with Trump and on the events

4494
03:42:39,400 --> 03:42:41,400
leading up to January 6th at the time.

4495
03:42:41,600 --> 03:42:44,100
Yeah, I think you could easily make the same justification

4496
03:42:44,100 --> 03:42:47,400
that listen this guy might fall under the scope of the investigation

4497
03:42:47,400 --> 03:42:51,300
maybe not but either way we can't we need to not give him

4498
03:42:51,300 --> 03:42:55,200
a position to influence the investigation and they and they

4499
03:42:55,200 --> 03:42:58,500
did it after and they did it after McCarthy tried to remove

4500
03:42:58,500 --> 03:42:59,100
Swalwell.

4501
03:42:59,100 --> 03:43:00,100
I think that matters.

4502
03:43:00,300 --> 03:43:02,600
I well there was a recommend.

4503
03:43:02,600 --> 03:43:03,300
Hey, I'm sorry.

4504
03:43:03,300 --> 03:43:05,300
My camera just kicked off.

4505
03:43:05,300 --> 03:43:06,600
So I'll just be on audio.

4506
03:43:06,800 --> 03:43:10,700
Okay, I've been using my I would say two things one that

4507
03:43:10,700 --> 03:43:18,500
was a request that didn't go anywhere which we know of as

4508
03:43:18,500 --> 03:43:19,700
for the J6 things.

4509
03:43:19,700 --> 03:43:25,700
I'm gonna make a two different arguments one is a knowledge

4510
03:43:25,700 --> 03:43:26,600
based argument.

4511
03:43:28,300 --> 03:43:33,700
If you have reason to suspect that somebody is going to be

4512
03:43:33,700 --> 03:43:37,500
implicated in a investigation for the quote-unquote overthrow

4513
03:43:37,800 --> 03:43:39,200
attempted overthrow of the United States.

4514
03:43:39,700 --> 03:43:41,600
You might want to put that out into the public that way

4515
03:43:41,600 --> 03:43:44,600
they can understand your decision-making at least some of

4516
03:43:44,600 --> 03:43:47,700
the evidence there because we didn't you're going to get

4517
03:43:47,700 --> 03:43:50,900
maligned with accusations of bias.

4518
03:43:51,400 --> 03:43:56,200
The second thing is a pragmatic argument of if you didn't

4519
03:43:56,200 --> 03:43:59,200
have this evidence to throw out there, but you had you know

4520
03:43:59,200 --> 03:44:03,800
suspicions for the sake of looking a nonpartisan in a neutral

4521
03:44:03,800 --> 03:44:08,400
RI body trying to do fact-find you don't get rid of the top

4522
03:44:08,400 --> 03:44:09,400
Republicans.

4523
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:14,000
That everybody likes out of the Commission and deny them

4524
03:44:14,500 --> 03:44:17,200
because you're going to get an issue where we have it now

4525
03:44:17,200 --> 03:44:21,500
where the J6 is nothing but considered evil Satan on the

4526
03:44:21,500 --> 03:44:26,100
right and the average population or the average citizen

4527
03:44:26,100 --> 03:44:27,900
of the United States doesn't actually give a shit about

4528
03:44:27,900 --> 03:44:28,600
what it found.

4529
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:31,400
So a couple of things number one.

4530
03:44:31,500 --> 03:44:35,300
It wasn't a request Kevin McCarthy made a formal resolution

4531
03:44:35,300 --> 03:44:38,900
to remove Swalwell from House Intelligence Committee.

4532
03:44:38,900 --> 03:44:39,700
It wasn't a request.

4533
03:44:39,700 --> 03:44:41,400
He tried to get it done by force.

4534
03:44:41,400 --> 03:44:43,100
He just didn't have the votes number one, right?

4535
03:44:43,100 --> 03:44:45,100
So it was a when I say request.

4536
03:44:45,100 --> 03:44:48,800
I mean like he proffered to do it and he tried to do it

4537
03:44:48,800 --> 03:44:50,500
and if he had his way it would have been done.

4538
03:44:50,500 --> 03:44:52,700
He just didn't have the support for it number one and he

4539
03:44:52,700 --> 03:44:56,300
get attempted at first and it was also a committee on which

4540
03:44:56,300 --> 03:45:01,100
Swalwell was currently seated number one number two, I would

4541
03:45:01,100 --> 03:45:04,500
argue that you wouldn't put that information out in the in

4542
03:45:04,500 --> 03:45:08,700
the public prematurely, even if it casts a pall on the investigation

4543
03:45:08,700 --> 03:45:11,200
like why aren't you seating Jim Jordan?

4544
03:45:11,900 --> 03:45:15,200
I agree that there's probably no satisfying way to do it

4545
03:45:15,200 --> 03:45:19,000
because if what if what you recommended was done and it

4546
03:45:19,000 --> 03:45:21,200
could be seen as prejudicing the investigation.

4547
03:45:21,200 --> 03:45:22,200
Okay, what's your evidence?

4548
03:45:22,200 --> 03:45:24,400
Well, we're not prepared to produce it yet because the committee

4549
03:45:24,400 --> 03:45:26,900
hasn't gotten started and by the way, we don't know where

4550
03:45:26,900 --> 03:45:27,400
it's going.

4551
03:45:27,400 --> 03:45:31,100
So the last thing we want to do is preemptively make act

4552
03:45:31,100 --> 03:45:33,400
against a sitting member of Congress.

4553
03:45:33,400 --> 03:45:35,700
I think you could easily make the argument that that was

4554
03:45:35,700 --> 03:45:39,700
the responsible thing to do and number number three, which

4555
03:45:39,700 --> 03:45:46,700
is the second point on this last part is the reason that

4556
03:45:46,700 --> 03:45:51,900
the committee ended up being so skewed is because Kevin McCarthy

4557
03:45:51,900 --> 03:45:54,500
Nancy Pelosi who did not have to do this.

4558
03:45:54,800 --> 03:45:57,600
He could have played hardball and said I'm the speaker Kevin

4559
03:45:57,600 --> 03:45:59,100
McCarthy. You're my bitch.

4560
03:45:59,100 --> 03:46:02,500
I'll just do whatever I want said is a gesture of good faith.

4561
03:46:02,500 --> 03:46:04,600
She said listen, let's do it 9-11 style.

4562
03:46:05,500 --> 03:46:07,100
I'll pick five Democrats.

4563
03:46:07,100 --> 03:46:10,900
You pick five Republicans will get equal subpoena power equal

4564
03:46:10,900 --> 03:46:12,400
time yada yada yada.

4565
03:46:13,800 --> 03:46:21,500
McCarthy offered five nominees and Nancy Pelosi shot down

4566
03:46:21,500 --> 03:46:25,100
two who were seen as potential witnesses or potential

4567
03:46:25,900 --> 03:46:28,200
potentially involved in the situation.

4568
03:46:28,200 --> 03:46:30,200
So she said listen those other three fine.

4569
03:46:30,200 --> 03:46:32,200
These two can't do it.

4570
03:46:32,200 --> 03:46:35,700
So can you pick some others and Kevin McCarthy said no it's

4571
03:46:35,700 --> 03:46:38,900
either my five the five that I named or none at all.

4572
03:46:39,100 --> 03:46:45,800
Yep, that's McCarthy's decision me because if you keep going

4573
03:46:45,800 --> 03:46:46,800
and I'll respond.

4574
03:46:46,800 --> 03:46:49,100
That's why I can say Kevin Kevin McCarthy.

4575
03:46:49,100 --> 03:46:53,700
It's not like it's not like Pelosi said you can't make any

4576
03:46:54,000 --> 03:46:57,500
Republicans or that there are no Republicans whatsoever.

4577
03:46:57,900 --> 03:46:59,500
She said give me five.

4578
03:46:59,500 --> 03:47:03,400
You just can't have these two and Kevin McCarthy refused I

4579
03:47:03,400 --> 03:47:06,100
would argue given that there were hundreds, you know, at

4580
03:47:06,100 --> 03:47:08,900
least 150 Republicans in the house at the time.

4581
03:47:08,900 --> 03:47:10,300
I can't remember the exact breakdown.

4582
03:47:10,300 --> 03:47:14,300
I think it had to be close to 200 plenty of other options.

4583
03:47:15,300 --> 03:47:17,100
So that's that's McCarthy's fault.

4584
03:47:17,100 --> 03:47:21,000
Not Pelosi's I would say that you're you're trying to say

4585
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:23,400
trying to so you're looking at this in a vacuum.

4586
03:47:23,600 --> 03:47:28,100
Unfortunately, the Democratic the Democrats I just got out

4587
03:47:28,100 --> 03:47:32,100
of two different impeachment attempts where the impeachment

4588
03:47:32,100 --> 03:47:36,600
inquiry was basically rail road through by one side and

4589
03:47:36,600 --> 03:47:41,500
so he attempted an olive branch by allowing pro-Trump voices

4590
03:47:41,500 --> 03:47:46,500
onto the thing to give some balance to this committee, even

4591
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:48,400
though it was obviously the findings are going to be negative

4592
03:47:48,400 --> 03:47:51,500
towards Trump and Republicans, but he was trying to provide

4593
03:47:51,500 --> 03:47:55,600
some balance there and once they were rejected the two most

4594
03:47:55,600 --> 03:47:59,700
like the most favored Republican Congressman in the nation

4595
03:48:00,200 --> 03:48:02,500
that people like never removed from it.

4596
03:48:03,000 --> 03:48:06,400
I there was no there was no like nobody was no Republican

4597
03:48:06,400 --> 03:48:09,300
was going to be satisfied with McCarthy and vote for him

4598
03:48:09,300 --> 03:48:10,300
again if he allowed it.

4599
03:48:10,600 --> 03:48:14,300
Wait, so so so this is this is where okay.

4600
03:48:14,300 --> 03:48:17,500
So yes impeachments tend to be partisan right now.

4601
03:48:17,500 --> 03:48:19,900
We're experiencing a partisan impeachment the impeachment

4602
03:48:19,900 --> 03:48:23,600
effort against president was partisan as well and Bush

4603
03:48:23,600 --> 03:48:28,300
impeachments are partisan by definition now, so so I don't

4604
03:48:28,300 --> 03:48:30,700
think that that has any bearing on the January 6th select

4605
03:48:30,700 --> 03:48:33,900
committee because Pelosi said well, let's do it bipartisanly

4606
03:48:33,900 --> 03:48:36,500
equal numbers equal subpoena power.

4607
03:48:36,900 --> 03:48:39,800
She just said you can't have these two.

4608
03:48:39,800 --> 03:48:42,100
That's a reasonable request to make and you say well, they

4609
03:48:42,100 --> 03:48:43,600
needed a pro-Trump voice.

4610
03:48:43,800 --> 03:48:46,500
I would I reject the argument or the suggestion.

4611
03:48:46,500 --> 03:48:48,500
I'm not saying you're arguing this but the implicit the

4612
03:48:48,500 --> 03:48:52,300
implicit suggestion of your argument is that there were no

4613
03:48:52,300 --> 03:48:56,900
other pro-Trump voices besides Jim Banks and Jim Jordan

4614
03:48:57,100 --> 03:48:59,200
who could have been put on that committee and I just

4615
03:48:59,200 --> 03:49:02,100
categorically reject that there were 200 Republicans in

4616
03:49:02,100 --> 03:49:07,400
Congress can and and and would is or to think so McCarthy

4617
03:49:07,400 --> 03:49:11,600
chose the most respected Republicans in the nation to go

4618
03:49:11,600 --> 03:49:14,400
on there that people liked that they could be relatively

4619
03:49:14,400 --> 03:49:17,800
sure that people would accept being on that committee and

4620
03:49:17,800 --> 03:49:21,400
that would be would give some good faith to it.

4621
03:49:21,600 --> 03:49:24,700
So he picked people that would give some credibility.

4622
03:49:24,700 --> 03:49:25,900
How could it be?

4623
03:49:25,900 --> 03:49:26,500
I'm sorry.

4624
03:49:26,500 --> 03:49:26,900
I'm sorry.

4625
03:49:26,900 --> 03:49:27,400
I have to interrupt.

4626
03:49:27,400 --> 03:49:31,600
How could it be good faith if Jim Jordan is not only pro-Trump

4627
03:49:31,600 --> 03:49:32,600
which is fine.

4628
03:49:32,700 --> 03:49:34,900
Yeah, but he is potentially involved.

4629
03:49:34,900 --> 03:49:38,700
They have reason to believe that he was involved with the

4630
03:49:38,700 --> 03:49:41,900
efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

4631
03:49:42,600 --> 03:49:43,100
Well, let's go.

4632
03:49:43,100 --> 03:49:44,200
Let's go with this, right?

4633
03:49:44,400 --> 03:49:49,500
So the the other side is staffed with Democrats who have

4634
03:49:49,700 --> 03:49:52,300
all unanimously tried to impeach Trump twice.

4635
03:49:52,700 --> 03:49:53,100
Sure.

4636
03:49:53,400 --> 03:49:53,600
Okay.

4637
03:49:53,600 --> 03:49:57,100
So there was never going to be a nonpartisan in the way of

4638
03:49:57,100 --> 03:49:58,800
not asking for not but wait a minute.

4639
03:49:58,800 --> 03:50:00,100
I'm not asking for nonpartisan.

4640
03:50:00,100 --> 03:50:00,800
I agree.

4641
03:50:00,900 --> 03:50:01,300
I agree.

4642
03:50:01,300 --> 03:50:03,200
You're not going to find you're not going to find neutral

4643
03:50:03,200 --> 03:50:07,000
people. I'm saying they could have found other partisan

4644
03:50:07,000 --> 03:50:10,200
Republicans who were pro-Trump that weren't potentially

4645
03:50:10,200 --> 03:50:13,200
involved. The United States population had faith in.

4646
03:50:14,100 --> 03:50:17,700
Like they only know Jim Jordan is the only one to have that

4647
03:50:17,700 --> 03:50:20,200
the United States has has any faith in again.

4648
03:50:20,200 --> 03:50:22,500
Actually, here's the issue.

4649
03:50:23,100 --> 03:50:25,200
Trey Gowdy and Jim Jordan are there.

4650
03:50:25,500 --> 03:50:28,400
Let me hop in here Artemis because I mean Matt Gates was

4651
03:50:28,400 --> 03:50:28,900
in the house.

4652
03:50:28,900 --> 03:50:29,400
Wasn't he?

4653
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:32,600
Isn't he like a well-known right-wing figure that people

4654
03:50:32,600 --> 03:50:33,300
on the right trust?

4655
03:50:33,300 --> 03:50:35,200
Like why didn't McCarthy tap him?

4656
03:50:35,300 --> 03:50:37,500
Because Gates and McCarthy were going at it.

4657
03:50:37,500 --> 03:50:37,900
Yeah.

4658
03:50:38,600 --> 03:50:38,900
Okay.

4659
03:50:38,900 --> 03:50:39,700
I mean, I don't know about that.

4660
03:50:39,700 --> 03:50:40,800
Maybe got him removed.

4661
03:50:40,800 --> 03:50:42,100
Yeah, correct.

4662
03:50:42,100 --> 03:50:42,600
They were fine.

4663
03:50:42,600 --> 03:50:43,200
They were for sure.

4664
03:50:43,200 --> 03:50:43,300
Sure.

4665
03:50:43,300 --> 03:50:44,200
But that was later.

4666
03:50:44,200 --> 03:50:46,000
That was like in that was no, no, no, no.

4667
03:50:46,100 --> 03:50:47,000
That was later.

4668
03:50:47,300 --> 03:50:48,300
It's a long time coming.

4669
03:50:48,800 --> 03:50:49,800
Yeah, it was like I was like, okay.

4670
03:50:49,800 --> 03:50:50,000
Yeah.

4671
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:54,500
Yeah, that's he was doing an option that even for his post

4672
03:50:54,900 --> 03:50:58,700
when he wasn't like removing McCarthy from the position

4673
03:50:59,000 --> 03:51:01,900
McCarthy was removing him from like committee assignments.

4674
03:51:02,300 --> 03:51:03,300
Okay, right.

4675
03:51:03,600 --> 03:51:06,400
So I looked into into fought into the five original picks

4676
03:51:06,400 --> 03:51:09,900
that McCarthy brought up and one of them was Troy Nels and

4677
03:51:10,200 --> 03:51:15,800
Troy Nels was never involved in Trump's plans, but he was

4678
03:51:15,800 --> 03:51:20,400
very pro Trump and he did, he did vote to have, you know,

4679
03:51:20,400 --> 03:51:22,800
the ballots inspector there or the electorate inspector,

4680
03:51:22,800 --> 03:51:24,000
whatever, whatever the case is.

4681
03:51:24,500 --> 03:51:27,300
He was one of the guys who did that, but he wasn't involved

4682
03:51:27,300 --> 03:51:30,200
in the, in the, you know, the Eastman memo implementation.

4683
03:51:30,200 --> 03:51:30,600
Right.

4684
03:51:30,900 --> 03:51:31,100
Yeah.

4685
03:51:31,100 --> 03:51:35,500
So she didn't throw Troy Nels off of the five.

4686
03:51:35,800 --> 03:51:38,900
So Nancy Pelosi seemed to be willing to allow, you know,

4687
03:51:38,900 --> 03:51:43,900
very pro Trump voices onto this committee, just not the

4688
03:51:43,900 --> 03:51:45,000
two that were involved.

4689
03:51:45,000 --> 03:51:46,300
You're going to, you're going to, I'm going to go back

4690
03:51:46,300 --> 03:51:51,800
to the, the, the, the Republican electorate know of Jim Jordan.

4691
03:51:52,300 --> 03:51:53,900
He is a known quantity to them.

4692
03:51:54,700 --> 03:51:55,200
Right.

4693
03:51:55,400 --> 03:51:59,300
Let's see home most popular Republican Republican House.

4694
03:51:59,300 --> 03:51:59,600
Okay.

4695
03:51:59,600 --> 03:52:00,000
Let's see.

4696
03:52:00,100 --> 03:52:02,700
Yeah, that's, that's, that's a, that's a comment that people

4697
03:52:02,700 --> 03:52:04,200
are making about Jim Jordan.

4698
03:52:04,200 --> 03:52:06,700
Now, I think if you take the polling literally that also

4699
03:52:06,700 --> 03:52:09,400
puts Jim Jordan above Donald Trump, if I remember correctly

4700
03:52:09,400 --> 03:52:13,100
when I cover probably from Jim Jordan's attempt at a speakership,

4701
03:52:13,500 --> 03:52:14,800
but listen, I don't number one.

4702
03:52:14,800 --> 03:52:17,300
I don't think that was the reason Kevin McCarthy offered

4703
03:52:17,300 --> 03:52:20,900
at the time because to be quite frankly until Dev pointed

4704
03:52:20,900 --> 03:52:22,900
out that Troy Nels was one of the names I couldn't even

4705
03:52:22,900 --> 03:52:25,300
remember the other three names.

4706
03:52:25,300 --> 03:52:28,100
So it's not like they were, you know, Kevin McCarthy was

4707
03:52:28,100 --> 03:52:30,000
going necessarily for star power.

4708
03:52:30,500 --> 03:52:32,800
No, no, it's not, it's not star power.

4709
03:52:32,800 --> 03:52:35,900
It's, it's the, it's trust and faith in the system.

4710
03:52:36,900 --> 03:52:40,400
You need trust and faith in a committee for people to believe

4711
03:52:40,400 --> 03:52:43,300
the committee's findings and because you remove the people

4712
03:52:43,300 --> 03:52:44,900
that would give it the most legitimacy.

4713
03:52:45,300 --> 03:52:48,100
You're going to restore resulting is going to be distrust.

4714
03:52:48,100 --> 03:52:49,000
Well, here, here, how about this?

4715
03:52:49,000 --> 03:52:49,200
How about this?

4716
03:52:49,200 --> 03:52:49,400
How about this?

4717
03:52:49,400 --> 03:52:49,900
How about this?

4718
03:52:49,900 --> 03:52:54,000
So, so like there's definitely a conspiracy worm in my brain

4719
03:52:54,400 --> 03:52:59,300
that says Pelosi knowingly rejected, knowingly rejected the

4720
03:52:59,300 --> 03:53:03,000
most popular Republicans in order to, in order to make this,

4721
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:07,800
you know just, just a witch hunt for the Democrats to go

4722
03:53:07,800 --> 03:53:09,100
after Trump there.

4723
03:53:09,100 --> 03:53:11,000
That's a conspiracy worm that I mean, it's possible.

4724
03:53:11,000 --> 03:53:13,100
I guess it's possible, but there's an alternate

4725
03:53:13,100 --> 03:53:16,600
conspiracy worm though, where, where basically McCarthy

4726
03:53:16,600 --> 03:53:21,600
put forward people that, yes, McCarthy put forward people

4727
03:53:21,600 --> 03:53:25,100
that he knew would have to be shot down because he didn't

4728
03:53:25,100 --> 03:53:27,600
even want to be part of the proceedings at all and that

4729
03:53:27,600 --> 03:53:29,000
gave him a justification to pull out.

4730
03:53:30,300 --> 03:53:33,200
And paint it and paint it as partisan as a result.

4731
03:53:33,200 --> 03:53:36,000
The issue is, is that there's no, there's no evidence of

4732
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:39,200
him knowing that, that that was going to take place.

4733
03:53:40,000 --> 03:53:43,600
There's evidence of him offering what he would normally

4734
03:53:43,600 --> 03:53:48,300
offer, the leading like Republican figure, which is Jim

4735
03:53:48,300 --> 03:53:51,800
Jordan, a position that he asked for on the committee and

4736
03:53:51,800 --> 03:53:54,000
then getting, they're getting rejected and then saying,

4737
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:55,900
okay, well, this is obviously partisan and pulling out.

4738
03:53:56,700 --> 03:53:59,000
Like we have evidence for those two things.

4739
03:54:00,400 --> 03:54:03,300
I think I reject some of the premises there.

4740
03:54:03,300 --> 03:54:06,500
Number one, I don't know if that was the reason that Kevin

4741
03:54:06,500 --> 03:54:08,900
McCarthy offered Jim Jordan in the first place.

4742
03:54:08,900 --> 03:54:11,600
And even if it is, I don't think that if that obligates

4743
03:54:11,600 --> 03:54:14,700
Nancy Pelosi to accept Jim Jordan, when there's sufficient

4744
03:54:14,700 --> 03:54:18,200
reason to believe that Jim Jordan may be implicated in

4745
03:54:18,200 --> 03:54:19,600
the scope of the investigation.

4746
03:54:21,300 --> 03:54:24,000
Yeah, I don't, I don't, no, no, no, because it's fine.

4747
03:54:24,000 --> 03:54:25,700
The bet, the back and forth is good, but I just don't want

4748
03:54:25,700 --> 03:54:26,700
to lose my train of thought here.

4749
03:54:26,700 --> 03:54:27,100
Yeah, go for it.

4750
03:54:27,100 --> 03:54:31,600
I don't think that Nancy Pelosi was obligated to give

4751
03:54:31,600 --> 03:54:35,400
Jim Jordan that position while knowing that, that he may

4752
03:54:35,400 --> 03:54:37,600
be implicated in the scope of the investigation.

4753
03:54:37,800 --> 03:54:40,500
I think it's reasonable for Nancy Pelosi to say, listen,

4754
03:54:41,500 --> 03:54:44,000
I'm kind of being generous right now anyway, doing this

4755
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:48,800
9-11 style bipartisan commission and giving you all equal

4756
03:54:48,800 --> 03:54:50,000
subpoena power.

4757
03:54:50,200 --> 03:54:52,400
You have 200 members in your conference.

4758
03:54:52,400 --> 03:54:56,400
You need, you can find five pro-Trump names who are trusted

4759
03:54:56,400 --> 03:54:58,900
by their constituents to put on here.

4760
03:54:58,900 --> 03:55:02,400
You just can't put people on here who may be implicated

4761
03:55:02,400 --> 03:55:04,200
in the scope of the investigation.

4762
03:55:04,700 --> 03:55:07,400
And for Kevin McCarthy to just reject that out of hand

4763
03:55:07,400 --> 03:55:10,600
and say, listen, no, it's Jim Jordan, Jim Banks, and these

4764
03:55:10,600 --> 03:55:12,400
other three or none at all.

4765
03:55:13,600 --> 03:55:16,000
I think that, let me ask you this.

4766
03:55:17,000 --> 03:55:20,300
What should, what should Pelosi have done, especially with

4767
03:55:20,300 --> 03:55:23,900
hindsight? Hindsight, if she wanted the J-6 committee's

4768
03:55:23,900 --> 03:55:27,600
findings to be considered anywhere credible, she should

4769
03:55:27,600 --> 03:55:28,800
have had Jim Jordan on there.

4770
03:55:29,600 --> 03:55:31,300
Regardless of whether or not he would have been called to

4771
03:55:31,300 --> 03:55:34,700
testify, they could have that instance happen where the

4772
03:55:34,700 --> 03:55:38,500
committee calls Jim Jordan to testify and he just publicly

4773
03:55:38,500 --> 03:55:40,100
says, no, I'm not doing it.

4774
03:55:40,200 --> 03:55:41,400
I would be fine with that.

4775
03:55:42,100 --> 03:55:43,500
I'm sure you would be.

4776
03:55:43,500 --> 03:55:44,600
I just don't know.

4777
03:55:44,600 --> 03:55:49,100
Let me, I don't think you would ever accept it if the shoe

4778
03:55:49,100 --> 03:55:50,200
was on the other foot.

4779
03:55:50,200 --> 03:55:53,900
Hey, give this Democrat witness who may be investigated and

4780
03:55:53,900 --> 03:55:57,600
put him in a position to influence the investigation in

4781
03:55:57,600 --> 03:55:59,600
question with equal subpoena power.

4782
03:56:00,400 --> 03:56:02,700
I don't think you would accept that nor should you, quite

4783
03:56:02,700 --> 03:56:04,400
frankly, that would be absurd.

4784
03:56:04,500 --> 03:56:07,800
We had to accept that during the crossfire hurricane and

4785
03:56:07,800 --> 03:56:13,100
the special counsel for Robert.

4786
03:56:13,100 --> 03:56:13,700
What was it?

4787
03:56:14,000 --> 03:56:14,800
Robert Mueller.

4788
03:56:15,200 --> 03:56:17,900
Okay, before you get into that, I know I'm now an hour

4789
03:56:17,900 --> 03:56:20,700
late and I have to go before you get into that.

4790
03:56:20,800 --> 03:56:22,600
We are, I have one final question.

4791
03:56:22,600 --> 03:56:24,600
Can you give me like the 32nd version of it?

4792
03:56:24,700 --> 03:56:29,600
Just the other instance of, I have heard something about

4793
03:56:29,700 --> 03:56:31,800
the January 6th committee destroying evidence.

4794
03:56:31,800 --> 03:56:33,300
It wasn't just nonsense.

4795
03:56:33,300 --> 03:56:36,500
I read an LA Times article about how some of it was destroyed.

4796
03:56:36,700 --> 03:56:37,500
What was the deal there?

4797
03:56:38,400 --> 03:56:41,700
Um, I know the, how do I say this?

4798
03:56:42,300 --> 03:56:44,900
So there was supposed to be exculpatory evidence that some

4799
03:56:44,900 --> 03:56:50,400
of the defendants were asking for that like videotapes of

4800
03:56:50,400 --> 03:56:54,300
themselves and how they were caught or whatever and they

4801
03:56:54,300 --> 03:56:55,600
weren't given any of that.

4802
03:56:56,200 --> 03:56:58,700
And then when they went to go asking for it, they said they

4803
03:56:58,700 --> 03:57:00,200
didn't have it and didn't have to give it.

4804
03:57:00,700 --> 03:57:04,000
And then when the Republicans were taking over the house

4805
03:57:04,000 --> 03:57:07,200
and the committee was told to preserve all of the data,

4806
03:57:08,000 --> 03:57:11,000
they didn't and then now it's no longer in existence.

4807
03:57:11,500 --> 03:57:15,600
Yeah, so from the LA Times article on the topic, possession

4808
03:57:15,600 --> 03:57:18,100
of the massive trove of evidence collected by the committee

4809
03:57:18,100 --> 03:57:20,800
was long expected to remain an issue on Capitol Hill once

4810
03:57:20,800 --> 03:57:22,100
the panel's work was done.

4811
03:57:22,500 --> 03:57:25,300
The select committee's 18 month investigation is believed

4812
03:57:25,300 --> 03:57:28,200
to be among the most extensive probes in congressional history,

4813
03:57:28,500 --> 03:57:31,900
but much of it was done behind closed doors, so the full

4814
03:57:31,900 --> 03:57:33,500
extent of what was collected is unknown.

4815
03:57:33,900 --> 03:57:35,700
Committee staff spoke with more than a thousand people

4816
03:57:35,700 --> 03:57:38,300
for the investigation, which resulted in millions of pages

4817
03:57:38,300 --> 03:57:43,500
of depositions, cell phone and text records, emails, staff

4818
03:57:43,500 --> 03:57:45,600
notes, and analysis by outside organizations.

4819
03:57:46,100 --> 03:57:49,200
Official records are typically handed over to a successor

4820
03:57:49,200 --> 03:57:52,100
committee, then to the house clerk and eventually to the

4821
03:57:52,100 --> 03:57:55,700
national archives where they're shielded by law from public

4822
03:57:55,700 --> 03:57:57,300
view for at least 30 years.

4823
03:57:57,300 --> 03:57:59,900
When Republicans took control of the house in January,

4824
03:58:00,500 --> 03:58:03,700
they included something new in the rules for the 118th

4825
03:58:03,700 --> 03:58:06,700
Congress, an order that all documents that were retained

4826
03:58:06,700 --> 03:58:09,500
from the house January 6 committee go to the house

4827
03:58:09,500 --> 03:58:10,600
administration committee.

4828
03:58:11,100 --> 03:58:13,500
All materials already sent to the national archives

4829
03:58:13,500 --> 03:58:14,800
were to be returned.

4830
03:58:16,500 --> 03:58:19,200
But I guess because this was from a new Congress,

4831
03:58:19,200 --> 03:58:20,900
they didn't honor that rule because it took place

4832
03:58:20,900 --> 03:58:21,900
in the previous Congress.

4833
03:58:22,100 --> 03:58:25,700
The leader of the committee said that he didn't think

4834
03:58:26,200 --> 03:58:29,100
they were, that he needed to preserve them so he didn't

4835
03:58:30,200 --> 03:58:31,900
is the, I think the direct quote.

4836
03:58:33,100 --> 03:58:36,100
If you, if I'm looking at that article with you because

4837
03:58:36,100 --> 03:58:38,700
again, I've heard this allegation as well.

4838
03:58:38,900 --> 03:58:42,600
I recall fact-checkers saying that it was not true, that

4839
03:58:42,600 --> 03:58:45,000
evidence was not knowingly destroyed.

4840
03:58:45,000 --> 03:58:48,300
If you read on those articles, it says that house rule,

4841
03:58:48,300 --> 03:58:51,900
it looks like seven, job lines preservation of house records

4842
03:58:51,900 --> 03:58:54,000
at the end of each two-year Congress and has been used

4843
03:58:54,000 --> 03:58:57,000
by nearly every Congress including the current one loosely

4844
03:58:57,000 --> 03:58:58,700
defines what has to be preserved.

4845
03:58:58,700 --> 03:59:01,200
It says the committee should preserve quote an official

4846
03:59:01,200 --> 03:59:03,700
permanent record of the committee including any record

4847
03:59:03,700 --> 03:59:06,700
of a legislative oversight or any or other activity of

4848
03:59:06,700 --> 03:59:08,400
such committee or subcommittee thereof.

4849
03:59:08,700 --> 03:59:11,200
What committees consider an official record have varied

4850
03:59:11,200 --> 03:59:12,300
widely over the years.

4851
03:59:12,300 --> 03:59:14,700
For some, the definition includes transcripts, official

4852
03:59:14,700 --> 03:59:16,700
correspondence, and drafts of legislation.

4853
03:59:17,200 --> 03:59:19,600
Other committees might include staff notes and internal

4854
03:59:19,600 --> 03:59:23,300
memos. Some preserve only their final report and notices

4855
03:59:23,300 --> 03:59:26,500
of hearings that were held. McCarthy, who is now speaker,

4856
03:59:26,500 --> 03:59:28,900
sent Benny Thompson a letter in December demanding the

4857
03:59:28,900 --> 03:59:32,300
preservation of all records collected and transcripts of

4858
03:59:32,300 --> 03:59:35,200
testimony taken during your investigation in accordance

4859
03:59:35,200 --> 03:59:38,200
with house rules, but he had no authority to enforce it

4860
03:59:38,200 --> 03:59:40,900
because the committee disbanded moments before the new

4861
03:59:40,900 --> 03:59:44,000
Congress controlled by Republicans was sworn in, their

4862
03:59:44,000 --> 03:59:46,900
new rule for ordering preservation of any non-concurrent

4863
03:59:46,900 --> 03:59:49,600
records from the committee could only apply to records

4864
03:59:49,600 --> 03:59:52,400
that had already been transferred to a successor committee

4865
03:59:52,400 --> 03:59:55,500
or to the National Archives. In essence, the Republicans

4866
03:59:55,500 --> 03:59:58,400
couldn't order the Jan 6 select committee to turn anything

4867
03:59:58,400 --> 04:00:00,700
over because it didn't exist existed.

4868
04:00:00,700 --> 04:00:01,700
Yeah, I read that one.

4869
04:00:02,000 --> 04:00:05,800
Yeah, and that tells me that because it because they because

4870
04:00:05,800 --> 04:00:09,000
it the new rule didn't take into place until after the

4871
04:00:09,000 --> 04:00:13,200
J6 committee was torn down and McCarthy didn't have any

4872
04:00:13,200 --> 04:00:15,400
power to tell them to hold on to it.

4873
04:00:15,500 --> 04:00:19,700
They decided not to keep it or that that tells me that

4874
04:00:20,200 --> 04:00:22,900
But if you if you read two paragraphs down, do you see

4875
04:00:22,900 --> 04:00:26,200
the step that Thompson said the select committee was not

4876
04:00:26,200 --> 04:00:29,100
obligated to archive all video recordings of transcribed

4877
04:00:29,100 --> 04:00:31,800
interviews or depositions, but determined that written

4878
04:00:31,800 --> 04:00:33,400
transcripts were sufficient.

4879
04:00:33,400 --> 04:00:36,900
So there is a record just not the total record that Republicans

4880
04:00:36,900 --> 04:00:38,500
wanted which was apparently the video tape.

4881
04:00:38,500 --> 04:00:39,400
So here's the thing.

4882
04:00:39,400 --> 04:00:40,200
Here's the thing, right?

4883
04:00:40,300 --> 04:00:42,600
Well, let me jump in here because I do I do have to go

4884
04:00:42,600 --> 04:00:43,100
right now.

4885
04:00:43,300 --> 04:00:44,200
We got a gang.

4886
04:00:44,200 --> 04:00:44,800
I'm hungry.

4887
04:00:44,800 --> 04:00:45,400
I'm starving.

4888
04:00:45,400 --> 04:00:48,100
Yeah, you get angry with get a snicker.

4889
04:00:49,100 --> 04:00:53,200
So basically like like I know that this is the legal proceeding.

4890
04:00:53,200 --> 04:00:57,000
It's probably all done above board in terms of the the letter

4891
04:00:57,000 --> 04:01:01,300
of the law, but as a data hoarder personally, I don't like

4892
04:01:01,300 --> 04:01:05,900
the idea of stuff due to a rule being like arbitrarily destroyed

4893
04:01:05,900 --> 04:01:08,700
or deleted or not able to be seen anymore that just bothers

4894
04:01:08,700 --> 04:01:12,500
me in a personal level because I like to keep I hoard every

4895
04:01:12,500 --> 04:01:15,000
single thing that I come across in case it's useful for later

4896
04:01:15,200 --> 04:01:18,900
every slip of paper every link every weird conspiracy Theory.

4897
04:01:18,900 --> 04:01:21,200
I keep it all backed up somewhere penis doodle.

4898
04:01:22,900 --> 04:01:24,600
Hoarders episode for you somewhere.

4899
04:01:24,600 --> 04:01:27,100
I'm sure yeah, I hoard data.

4900
04:01:27,100 --> 04:01:28,300
I hoard data like crazy.

4901
04:01:28,300 --> 04:01:32,200
So when I hear this like I don't know if this could be used

4902
04:01:32,200 --> 04:01:35,100
legally, but it does make me think like why don't you just

4903
04:01:35,100 --> 04:01:36,300
why don't you just keep it guys?

4904
04:01:36,500 --> 04:01:40,000
Like what the fuck there is it raises questions that didn't

4905
04:01:40,000 --> 04:01:40,700
need to be raised.

4906
04:01:40,800 --> 04:01:44,900
But um before we go up, I just want to thank you Doug for

4907
04:01:44,900 --> 04:01:47,800
coming on spend some time with me and collabing with me

4908
04:01:47,800 --> 04:01:48,100
a bit.

4909
04:01:48,100 --> 04:01:52,200
I'll put my check to you in the mail because this is business

4910
04:01:52,200 --> 04:01:53,100
transaction, right?

4911
04:01:53,300 --> 04:01:55,200
You saw that tweet funny.

4912
04:01:55,200 --> 04:01:56,500
Oh my God.

4913
04:01:56,700 --> 04:01:56,800
Okay.

4914
04:01:56,800 --> 04:01:59,600
There was like a vtuber who was saying like listen every

4915
04:01:59,600 --> 04:02:01,800
every time you collab with someone like someone's got to

4916
04:02:01,800 --> 04:02:02,800
be paying someone.

4917
04:02:03,100 --> 04:02:04,700
It's all it's all transactional.

4918
04:02:04,700 --> 04:02:06,900
There's no real friendships in the online space.

4919
04:02:07,100 --> 04:02:09,400
It's like what the fuck it like are you sociopathic?

4920
04:02:09,400 --> 04:02:10,800
What are they living in?

4921
04:02:10,800 --> 04:02:13,500
This is all friendship based which I mean great terrible

4922
04:02:13,500 --> 04:02:14,700
at the same time, right?

4923
04:02:15,000 --> 04:02:16,800
Dev asks me for money all the time.

4924
04:02:17,000 --> 04:02:19,100
Oh, well, yeah, that's because that's because you make a

4925
04:02:19,100 --> 04:02:21,800
cake on that's because you make six figures a month.

4926
04:02:22,100 --> 04:02:23,700
I don't care what I'm on.

4927
04:02:24,000 --> 04:02:24,700
Holy shit.

4928
04:02:24,700 --> 04:02:24,900
Right.

4929
04:02:24,900 --> 04:02:25,300

4934

I would love to have like a more sit-down thing about this.

4935
04:02:38,400 --> 04:02:40,800
But again, you caught me when I'm trapped.

4936
04:02:40,800 --> 04:02:42,100
