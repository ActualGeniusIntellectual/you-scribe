63800	64400	It's not okay.

65400	66800	Oh, you sound much better.
66900	69600	I don't know what you changed, but I can hear you now.
69600	73300	So this is way too loud from my usual recording.
73300	74800	So I have to remember to turn it back down.
79200	81200	So I thought that we're gonna move is showing up.
83200	84200	Has she bailed?
84600	85500	I don't think so.
85500	87100	I talked to her this morning.
87900	91100	She's having a date night with her husband, but she's going to try to call in.
91100	92200	We'll see, right?
92700	94800	I don't know how that works, but we'll see.
96100	97100	I hope she gets here.
98900	102800	So let me send her a quick little message.
103500	112400	Yeah, when you approached me for this I was like, I have no clue why you'd want to do this because there's no set topic and I'm not an interesting person on my own.
112700	113500	What are you talking about?
113700	114200	Yes, you are.
117700	119400	My videos are interesting, but I'm not interesting.
120000	121800	Why do you why do you hate yourself like this?
121800	124400	Like if I didn't think you were interesting, I wouldn't invite you on.
125600	126500	I don't hate myself.
126500	128400	I just know where my strengths and weaknesses are.
128400	138600	Well, let's interrogate this a little bit like so I see you all the time have conversations with people hours long and people tune in people watch people view it.
139700	142400	What what what why is this different right?
142400	146800	Like there's several things that we could talk about like the Jew tunnels.
147100	149100	We have to I have to get your opinion, right?
149700	151800	I have no clue what's going on with that man.
153300	162800	It there's going to be some great memes that come out of it and we're probably going to see that video of that one Jewish guy climbing out of the sewer grate that's going to be reposted for the next 50 years.
162800	163400	I'm sure.
164700	167000	Yeah, but I don't know.
167300	168000	Did you see that?
168000	171000	I have I don't know that I don't know the main story there.
171000	183000	Like I've heard some people say that like that the tunnel is actually run to was it a children's hospital or an orphanage or something and they're having sex with kids down there and like I don't know I've seen so much wacky stuff.
183000	187200	I don't know what's true and I think the story is too new to know what's really true just yet.
187400	189500	No, I agree with you.
189500	192300	It's it's a it's something that they're going to investigate.
192300	194000	We're going to find out in the future.
194000	195900	But you're right.
195900	197600	The means are super funny.
198600	211100	And there's a small little interaction I saw on Twitter a while ago about a man in New York City who was complaining on Twitter that he was hearing Yiddish underneath his bed at night, right?
211100	218100	Like it sounded like there was Jewish people digging tunnels and he was tweeting about this in November, right?
218500	226900	And no one believes everyone thought he was just lying like he was this this huge anti-semite and I just I don't know.
226900	236500	I can't get it out of my head where I have this image of this guy who's like legit hearing digging sounds underneath and he's trying to tell people but no one believes them.
236500	239100	They all think he's just making it up to me.
239100	242600	I don't know that's peak funny, but you know, maybe I'm wrong.
242600	243700	Maybe I'm built different.
243700	245900	I don't know but I can't stop laughing at it.
245900	248800	So I don't know that is that is pretty funny.
248800	260700	Yeah, like I've seen a few people claim that the New York Police rather than investigate it are just filling the tunnels with concrete and trying to like hope everyone forgets about it.
260700	261700	I don't know if that's true.
261700	277800	I don't I don't know what anything about this like I think we'll have to wait a little bit to see what happens if we wait a month and no one said a single peep and the and the police aren't commenting then maybe you can talk about how it might be some sort of a conspiracy but right now it's probably too soon to tell.
278200	280900	Maybe I don't know.
280900	293700	It's a so the rumor I've heard the more reasonable rumor I've heard is that they built these during the covid during the lockdowns because they still wanted to get to their synagogue, right?
293700	299100	They would they wanted to congregate even during the covid lockdown, but I'm not sure how true that is.
299800	302300	It's just something I've heard so we'll see.
302300	302900	It's possible.
302900	304000	Yeah, possible.
304500	305800	Like I said, we'll see.
305800	316000	It's and yes, there's a lot of anti-semitism a lot of like sex with kids conspiracies and stuff and coming out of this but it's still funny.
316100	317800	So I can't I don't know.
317800	318500	It is pretty funny.
318500	322100	Yeah, but I'm getting I'm gonna try to find it.
322100	322500	Hold on.
324900	326100	Give me just a second.
328200	332100	A surprisingly good resource for this stuff is actually know your meme.
332300	332800	Really?
333600	338000	Yeah, because they do document means they also document at least some of the context behind them.
338800	343300	I wouldn't just trust them, but they sometimes have things that others don't.
346100	350400	So for example, here I'll DM you this.
351100	352100	Let's see what you got.
353400	358600	So I always take Twitter headlines of the grain of salt, right?
359300	366000	Like for example, this guy is claiming that the other tunnels are being sealed off by the police, right?
366600	368500	It's like well, maybe.
370100	377200	Well, I did see I did see video of them like the one of the sewer grates welding it shut again.
377200	378700	I have no I have no idea.
382000	386800	This yeah, I don't know how true this is either.
387800	390000	It is interesting though.
391400	395000	And unfortunately, it's going to feed into a lot of stereotypes.
395000	396700	We'll see how it goes, right?
396700	397500	We'll see how it goes.
399500	402000	But this is a call-in show.
402000	407000	So I just wanted to let my members know if you want to call in and talk to us.
407000	408700	You absolutely can.
408700	410900	Thank you for the super chats, by the way.
410900	413700	Thank you to Zephyrhash.
414700	417300	Nobody believes me when I hear wick in my walls.
417300	421100	Well, what they'll never find my Donald's buddy.
421300	422900	They'll never I'm too clever.
422900	428700	Okay, and Jacob for $5 says I know a lot about the community and can speak to this with confident knowledge.
430300	438300	Risky risky caller, but if you want to call in and then and tell us how much you know about the Jewish community like this could go one of two ways.
439300	447800	You could be deeply involved Hasidic Jew yourself or you could you could know what they are thinking and what they don't want you to know.
447800	451900	I don't know but you can absolutely call in and talk to us.
452500	458500	We do have a caller someone you and I both know and love.
459400	460200	I'll give you a second.
461200	465800	Our friend art of a spell.
468800	471100	Hi Artemis.
471100	471700	How's it going?
471700	472500	Not bad.
472500	473700	How are you doing?
474500	475100	Good.
477000	484700	So we're going with the Jewish tunnels as a topic or you you're the caller you get to talk to us about you want to talk about the Jewish tunnels.
484700	489500	I'm out mine, but it's not going to be as entertaining as a one might think.
491000	494800	Well, actually here do you usually you have some secret glowy knowledge.
494800	496800	So tell us about the Jewish tunnels Artemis.
496800	516900	Well, what do you know for starters the city of New York City has been at war with the city Jewish population ever since covid lockdown started speak specifically their shops and stores and stuff were like brutally like broken into by police because they were serving people.
517900	522300	And getting them all shut down by by the city.
523900	532200	I wouldn't be surprised to be honest, I think I think a lot of let's say more more religiously radical communities really bucked against the covid lockdown.
532200	533400	So makes sense.
533400	546600	Yeah, the it's actually so notorious that they were going after Hasidic Jewish population that they were filing complaints that they were targeting them specifically because of their ethnicity and religion.
547600	552000	That was early on with this tunnel thing.
552000	568200	I have heard about the child accusations and that comes from like an interview with a potential victim from a year or two ago claiming they were taken into tunnels and forced to do whatever on stained mattresses.
568600	577500	And then you see from this tunnel thing that you seeing these weird cheap ass matches being pulled out of the tunnels and they're just stained all hell.
577500	580000	So I think that's where they're pulling that from.
580900	583900	Yeah, that's such a such a loose connection for session.
583900	586500	It is but that's but that's the internet.
586500	589100	It's going to they're going to be connections drawn like that.
589100	603700	Well, here's the thing, like if you've ever done any sort of urban exploration, like into an abandoned building or into a like a sewer or a pipe or something that's big enough to hold people or or you go to like some isolated area, even out in the woods, you will eventually find just a dirty mattress.
603700	610300	And what it usually is is a homeless person was squatting there for a while, you know, it's usually not some sort of weird sex cult.
610300	616500	It's usually a homeless person who dug a mattress out of a dumpster and drag it into a tunnel and has been sleeping there for a bit.
616500	622200	Okay, yeah, but this is this is the tunnels that are like run and maintained by the Hasidic Jewish population of this.
622200	623400	Yeah, of this.
624100	624600	I don't know.
624600	629900	It's just like, look, I know people who have stained mattresses in their in their actual house, right?
629900	634900	Yeah, I think to my knowledge, they're not kidnapping kids, right?
634900	646100	To my knowledge, the bigger story is why is the NYC Police Department immediately going in and trying to fill the fucking tunnels of concrete without first removing everybody from them?
647300	648000	Is it concrete?
648500	649100	I've seen them.
649100	651700	I've seen them weld some of the entrances.
651800	653900	They've been they've been pouring concrete.
653900	655600	They try to pour concrete into the tunnels.
655900	656700	Is there proof of that?
657400	663200	Let me go find one of the images of the the concrete slurry that was poured and then thought.
663200	672100	Well, yeah, but it does kind of make sense that they would start welding some of the some of the entrances because you don't want people on the street falling into them and make that make sense.
672300	675300	Yeah, they they were the Jewish were breaking the pipes.
675300	680500	They were using the pipe the pump the concrete in the bike like breaking the tubing.
680700	691700	So let me go find that if I also it does make sense, right that they would try to because digging under the foundations of houses and structure.
692100	695600	It can't be good for the stability of those structures, right?
695600	696300	It can't.
696300	696700	Yeah.
697500	700000	Also also we're you got to put up that image IDM.
700000	701700	Do you bring that up?
702100	703100	Give me a second.
703100	703700	Hold on.
704400	705800	I am I'm okay gang.
705800	711200	I'm very bad at tech, but we will make this happen.
712700	713600	Boom boom boom.
714600	714900	Let's see.
714900	717700	Let me find the get the correct.
717700	722500	I'm pretty sure it should be immediately the first things I find.
722500	726800	Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to show it to you without like exposing.
729400	732000	All my tabs and bullshit like that.
736100	741400	Oh my God, someone made a D&D rule set called Talmud's and tunnels.
744000	749500	Again, the memes are going to be they're going to be a lot and they're going to be amazingly good.
749900	751500	Okay, let's see if this works.
752500	755700	Oh, let me get this off the cameras flickering.
755700	755900	Yeah.
755900	756100	Yeah.
756100	756800	What's going on?
756900	758500	Can we can we see this gang?
759500	766000	Can we see the teenage Jewish Turtles or whatever they got up here?
766900	769300	What tabs do I have with don't worry about my tabs.
769300	771000	Okay, don't worry about my tabs.
771000	774200	Don't worry about my being going to reveal all the DMS right?
774200	776000	Well, let's not let's not talk about it.
776000	778700	Okay, let's you know what?
779400	780700	Okay, everyone saw it.
780800	783000	Everyone got a good little good little look.
783000	785300	Yeah, it was good.
785800	787000	This is only the beginning.
787300	789300	This is only beginning there.
789400	796400	We're going to be mining for memes in the Jewish mines for a while and it'll be great.
796800	805900	But you made some you made a claim earlier Artemis that they were doing it before everyone got out of the got out of the system.
807400	810500	Yeah, do you have anything to corroborate that?
810700	814400	Yeah, I do because they had the police haven't gone into the tunnels yet.
816700	817300	What do you mean?
817900	821400	Let me the police have not gone into the tunnels yet.
821900	827900	There's still fighting the the Jewish people at the temple and then trying to board up the hole.
828300	832900	So you're saying that they're they're closing the tunnel all the tunnel entrance without actually going in themselves.
833000	833200	Yeah.
833200	837900	Yeah, there's no proof that they've looked at any of the tunnels they they've started filling them.
838100	842000	So that the issue with that is is that regardless of what that there's anybody in there.
842000	843200	They haven't looked.
843700	845500	Well, did you find proof that they're filling them yet?
845800	846100	Yeah.
846100	846700	Hold on.
847300	847900	No problem.
847900	849700	Give them a minute.
849900	856100	You know me, you know me results come up when I look for Jewish tunnels and concrete Hamas is still a thing, right?
856600	857500	No, I know I get it.
859900	861200	They learn from the best.
861200	861800	That's how they learn.
861800	862300	Oh God.
862300	865200	There's a Hogwarts meme of the the first movie.
865500	868600	The tunnels and the ring into the house pretty funny.
868600	871000	I thought you shouldn't know and then passes out.
871000	876600	Yeah, here's some some the WIC community members suggestion the Juni to the center of the earth.
876700	877900	No, that's pretty bad game.
878000	878300	Okay.
880000	883300	Did I even like it when it pops through my thing?
884200	884600	Okay.
884600	889900	Well, it's usually something I like when when I see it, but I'll try to find it and give it to you.
890000	890400	Sure.
890800	896900	What I actually came on here for please is to ask wick that some things and then maybe dev can chime in later.
897400	918400	Okay, if you have a process that leads to a guilty verdict that was founded upon corrupt methods and driving evidence through corrupt methods in illegal in illegal ways with the verdict should the verdict stand.
920500	927000	Well, when you phrase it like that, no fruit from the poison tree there are reasons why the method is important.
927000	929700	Like for example, Bill Cosby Bill Cosby.
930700	932600	He probably is guilty of what he did.
932600	943500	Okay, let's not mince words, but what they did to get the verdict like how they extracted his testimony violated his rights.
944000	946100	And so we can't let that stand.
946600	950300	Yeah, so do you know here's a another question and then I'll get the actual point.
950600	956200	Do you know the difference between White House Council and Special Counsel is not not taught my head.
956200	956400	Nope.
956900	960000	So White House Council is the council directly for the president.
960000	979000	So the attorney the attorney directly to the president sure a special counsel is a an attorney that has been selected by the DOJ or appointed by the or whoever in through their through the systems method to have a like immunity from interference to go after a certain thing or whatever.
979600	979900	Right?
979900	982000	Those are two very different things.
982000	982600	Okay, right.
983100	997800	Okay, so I got a question for you for the Fulton County DA Fannie Willis who has a point who apparently appointed her inexperienced lover as the lead prosecutor for Donald Trump's Rico case.
999000	1000100	What do you think about that?
1002700	1005200	I don't know what think about it friend.
1005500	1008200	I can't comment on it until I look into it, right?
1008300	1011100	Like if you're just saying that it is like this is filed.
1011400	1012400	Is it nepotism?
1012400	1014300	Are you is that the accusation here?
1014800	1020100	Well, definitely it would be nepotism because there are several hundred different lawyers and attorneys.
1020100	1038100	Sure, but when we talk about like corrupt processes, yeah, I don't that's that's not what I mean, right them appointing a their cousin or brother or something to be the council that is an ethics violation and probably should be looked or potentially one I should say it could be looked into.
1038600	1043400	But I don't think it violates anyone's rights or affects the evidence.
1043600	1044300	None of that.
1044500	1044900	What do you think?
1044900	1045600	What happens?
1047100	1048200	Okay, go ahead Dev.
1048400	1049000	Let's hear it.
1049700	1050100	Hold on.
1050400	1051600	No, you go ahead.
1051600	1052100	Give me a second.
1052400	1052600	Okay.
1052600	1065100	So the second part is going to be what if that person that was that is the lover that is inexperienced meets with the White House counsel during their prosecution investigation.
1066100	1070300	Um, look, I don't I don't know how normal that is.
1070300	1071100	Biden's attorneys.
1071100	1074100	Sure, but I don't know if that's a that's necessary.
1074100	1078600	Like don't the the adversarial attorneys meet all the time to discuss courtship.
1078800	1079100	Is that?
1079100	1081400	No, no, no, you're making this is not an app.
1081400	1082400	This is not an adversarial.
1082400	1084600	This is not Trump's White House counsel.
1085000	1088900	This is the Biden administration's White House counsel.
1088900	1090200	Okay, what's wrong with that?
1090900	1092900	Yeah, that's not that's not that's not legal.
1093700	1103900	Oh, I understand but because it'd be coordinating with the political opponents to prosecute somebody.
1103900	1109200	That's what would be the illusion of it because for a fair trial, right?
1109400	1115400	You're supposed to avoid even the like image of corruption and bias.
1116600	1117000	Right?
1117000	1117300	Huh?
1118000	1118400	Okay.
1119400	1122700	This is well and true beyond that at the at this point in time.
1123300	1124500	I'll have to look into it.
1124500	1127800	I'll have to get more information on that.
1127800	1136000	But yeah, if it if it was an ethics violation or if it was illegal, it was criminal should be prosecuted and should be looked into and it could affect the ruling.
1136000	1136800	Absolutely.
1137000	1137600	Oh stupid.
1137600	1139100	Oh, it's the wick wick.
1139100	1142000	I sent you an article you can just read it really quickly here.
1142400	1151300	Trump co-defendant alleges improper relationship between Fannie Willis and fellow Georgia prosecutor in a filing seeking to dismiss the charges.
1151500	1156200	Michael Roman's attorney accused Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade of having a romantic relationship.
1156500	1157700	This is what you're talking about, right?
1158200	1159700	It's not an accusation.
1159700	1174600	They it's almost confirmed that the reason why it's almost it's an accusation now is because they have to unseal a document that was sealed recently that was talking about how Fannie's had a Willis had a relationship with that person.
1175000	1175600	Right, right.
1176000	1187500	In a 39 page filing seeking dismissal of charges an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman made accusations that Willis and Wade have traveled together destinations including Napa Valley and they've been seen together in Atlanta in a personal capacity.
1187900	1190600	And this is about the lover accusation.
1190700	1191100	Yeah.
1191100	1191500	Well, yes.
1191500	1199000	This is the lead prosecutor that Fannie Willis has appointed who is also apparently her lover that she's having an affair with.
1199000	1203900	Like I'm more interested in the other thing though the meeting with the Biden Council or whatever.
1204300	1205400	Yeah, that's in the
1206200	1208100	Yeah, if you have that you can just look at that too.
1208100	1209200	I think I do.
1209200	1209600	Hold on.
1209600	1210700	Yeah, because I sent it to you.
1210700	1211100	You should.
1211100	1211700	Yes.
1212800	1215100	Again, this is again, yeah, I'll send this to you as well.
1215100	1216900	Like this is again a Twitter headline.
1216900	1223300	So it's always good to look beyond Twitter headlines and actually look at some things a bit more deeply, but it's a good place to start a conversation.
1223300	1235300	Yeah, Nathan Wade Fannie Willis is the lead prosecutor met with Biden's White House Council on May 23rd and November 18th 2022 before indicting Donald Trump.
1236600	1242100	Yeah, so this is not the special council that was in charge of actually investigating him for crimes.
1242300	1245700	This is the White House Council, which is Biden's representatives.
1246800	1251400	So he has no reason to even talk to them at all.
1251400	1254800	So so this seems like before Fannie Willis.
1255000	1260100	Yes, appointed Nathan Wade as part of the Georgia Rico case.
1260100	1262500	That's what's going on here, right before that even happened.
1262700	1263000	Correct.
1263000	1268500	He had already met with the White House Council, which is why personal the personal loyal lawyer to the president.
1268500	1271200	Yeah, why would he have any capacity be talking to them?
1271600	1272100	I don't know.
1272300	1273600	Well, I guess yes.
1274900	1279500	So the answer is he doesn't have any actual official reason to be talking.
1279500	1280700	So what do you what do you find?
1281800	1289000	Well, one, the Fannie Willis is was coordinating to bring prosecution to Trump in Georgia.
1289500	1297700	She had a boyfriend who was not well known to to anybody in the public who she could send as a proxy to go talk to them.
1297900	1306900	And then she appointed him as the lead prosecutor in the case because one, it's your boyfriend to they they share the money that he makes from the prosecution.
1307700	1310700	Who they've they've already stated that in the allegations.
1311000	1320200	So this is all true, but it's also conceivable that you would have people working on the Georgia Rico case also talking to the president's office.
1320400	1321600	That also makes sense.
1321900	1329000	This guy before this guy ever was appointed and he has no experience prosecuting hardly at all anybody.
1329500	1330900	OK, he had no reason.
1330900	1331200	Hold on.
1331200	1332500	Isn't isn't he an attorney?
1332800	1335600	He like before he's an attorney, right?
1335700	1337500	Yeah, but not all attorneys do prosecutions, man.
1338100	1341700	OK, let's see what he's doing or high or high level ones for that matter.
1341700	1342600	Let's look him up.
1342600	1343800	What's his work history?
1344100	1344400	Yep.
1345200	1349400	Yeah, I mean, like you have to have a first case at some point, right?
1349400	1350900	Like you have to have a hold on.
1351100	1355700	You don't you don't you don't you don't send a brand new person to prosecute the former president of the United States.
1355700	1356500	This is not going to happen.
1357500	1358300	Apparently did.
1359000	1359400	Yeah.
1359500	1362600	Who is Nathan Wade Fulton special special prosecutor?
1362600	1363500	Let's see what he's done.
1363900	1365100	He's a special prosecutor.
1366000	1367500	He works in private practice.
1367500	1370200	He's a defense attorney and a one time municipal court judge.
1371000	1372800	Suburban Atlanta firm.
1372800	1378500	Wade and Campbell focuses on personal injury cases, contract litigation, family and domestic law and criminal defense.
1378900	1381400	A graduate of John Marshall Law School.
1381800	1382700	He was an assistant.
1382800	1385700	He was an assistant solicitor for Cobb County in 1999.
1386200	1388500	Yeah, the office that handles misdemeanor cases.
1389000	1396800	He became Marietta's first black male judge in 20, not black, black and male, you know, black and male judge in 2011.
1397500	1399500	He was appointed to a post in the city's municipal court.
1400700	1406900	He he tried to run for higher judge offices because those are elected in this location and he did not win.
1407200	1407500	Yep.
1407600	1412000	You don't need any type of credentials to be elected to as a to a judge.
1412000	1413400	It's got it's a populated contest.
1413700	1414000	Yeah.
1414700	1416000	So that so being a judge.
1416100	1429300	He was in 2020, he was retained by Cobb Sheriff Neil Warren to review complaints of use of force, racial biases, discrimination, neglect at the county jail after seven detainees died in custody.
1431400	1436500	So basically, he is a lawyer and he's held like a bunch of small time positions.
1436800	1445300	So you can say that him him being raised to this high profile job by what seems to be his girlfriend is improper.
1445500	1446300	That makes sense.
1446600	1447000	Right.
1447400	1448500	But hold on, hold on.
1448800	1454400	But that being said, him meeting with the White House is not necessarily improper.
1454700	1455100	It is.
1455900	1457700	Why is he one?
1458100	1462800	You don't meet with the political opponent of a person you're going to indict.
1463400	1474300	That that's not something you want to do as a prosecutor if you're going to prosecute a case because then you are opening up the door for reversible error in terms of bias prosecutorial malice possible.
1474300	1474900	That's possible.
1475600	1477300	That's why you know, that's why you avoid it.
1477900	1479500	OK, you do it outright.
1479500	1480300	You avoid that.
1480500	1495500	You find somebody who's not connected to anybody and you select them as the lead prosecutor to avoid these things because this is a a the very minimal stepping stone for a fair trial because the defense is going to tear your part if they find it.
1496600	1497600	That that's what it sounds like.
1497600	1500600	It sounds like they'll get they'll get torn apart in court then, but what else is there?
1501400	1501900	What do you mean?
1502300	1502700	What do you mean?
1502700	1503900	We said you said one.
1503900	1505800	Is there any other reason why this is bad?
1506500	1506900	Yes.
1506900	1529900	So if the if the person is going to a before having even being anointed as a special prosecutor and they're going to a the White House counsel to talk to Biden's representative, that means that there was already an intent to put them in as the special prosecutor ahead of time.
1530500	1538700	So that this is pre-planning in coordination by the administration with Fannie Willis ahead of time to to put a problem with that.
1538700	1544200	Oh, yeah, you're not you're not an inexperienced prosecutor on the case.
1544800	1554000	They hatched the plot to meet with him before and do what coordinate coordinate prosecutions across multiple states.
1554900	1559700	I just why would I will I don't understand the motivation other than
1560100	1562900	I want this guy to be the prosecutor because I'm sleeping with them.
1564300	1564600	Why?
1564600	1565000	Okay.
1565000	1568100	I don't understand why there has to be any deeper meeting than these people are.
1568100	1570200	Well, because you came in right?
1570200	1576800	Yeah, you came in and you say should these things stand when they've their corrupt processes of violate people's rights.
1576900	1584200	My answer that is no, but then I look at to okay, this is this is yeah, this is probably improper.
1584200	1589500	If what you're saying is correct, if what you're saying is correct, it's probably improper, but I don't I don't know if it.
1590400	1592500	Okay, so anything to the case, right?
1592800	1603400	So if you have some again, it goes back to a biased prosecutor prosecutorial.
1603400	1604600	We call malfeasance.
1604900	1605600	Okay charge.
1605600	1609700	I mean, maybe it's like I said, I'm not a legal scholar and I don't know much about the law.
1609700	1611700	I don't know much about the legal processes.
1611800	1613800	You could be absolutely correct here.
1614000	1617500	I just as a layman as someone just looking into these things.
1617700	1621100	It just doesn't it doesn't set off too many alarms other than yeah.
1621100	1621400	Okay.
1621400	1622400	They had their friend.
1622400	1623600	I understand that.
1623600	1628600	I understand that normal corruption in like Democratic areas is going to not set off alarms.
1629000	1631700	But when you already have hold on, hold on, hold on.
1631700	1632300	Let me finish.
1632300	1632600	Go ahead.
1632600	1632900	Go ahead.
1632900	1633100	Go ahead.
1633100	1644000	We have Fannie Willis nepotistically appointing an inexperienced and unqualified attorney to being a prosecutor for which he has no prosecutorial background.
1644800	1666000	As the lead prosecutor with unlimited power as a special prosecutor, okay against a former president of the United States when he had met with the president's political enemies before this you are now in so far into the get rid of this fucking guy and replace him with somebody better.
1667400	1673700	And at the very start that should have been the start thing but they went in have done all of this and then charged him and now I'm going to trial.
1674200	1682700	This is irreversible error because now you're showing that the system and the people in power are too biased to have followed proper conduct.
1682700	1692500	Well, then if our legal system is working and if what you're saying is correct, it's going to be a kind of an own goal on the prosecution side.
1692500	1698100	It is and this is the issue is that yeah, but like I said, I don't I don't know.
1698500	1703100	I think that's evidence that the system is working and I don't know.
1703100	1703600	I don't know.
1703600	1704300	Does that make sense?
1704300	1708900	At least that like, okay, they did something really stupid and they're going to be punished in court for it.
1709500	1718900	So this is the like at this is the this is the same Fulton County that has been stonewalling a ballot case for three years now.
1718900	1721300	Don't just bring up another fucking thing man.
1721300	1723800	Like come on but but this is true and you can't argue.
1723800	1724100	Okay.
1724100	1724600	Sure.
1724600	1726000	It's true, but it's unrelated.
1726400	1726800	Okay.
1726800	1728500	I'm just saying this is right here.
1728500	1730100	I have a question to ask you at the start of this.
1730100	1731300	Okay, I do have a question.
1731300	1735300	So what you've what you've brought here seems to be two separate things.
1735500	1736400	Okay, go ahead.
1736800	1744500	And the first one is Fannie Willis appoints her boyfriend who and she is a public figure.
1744500	1747600	He is not she is kind of well known.
1747600	1756300	He really isn't that well known his career what he's done in his career does not seem to warrant him be him being given this this huge position.
1756900	1760800	And so it seems like it's an it she has improperly appointed him.
1761400	1763000	That seems to be true from what we have.
1763000	1763400	All right.
1763400	1763800	All right.
1764200	1773000	However, the the second part of the second thing that you have here is why did this guy meet with the White House legal team, right?
1773000	1774800	Those are two those are two separate questions.
1774800	1791100	So for example, if it turns out that he actually has completely good reasons for meeting with the White House legal team like what hold on if that were the case then the first the first problem which is he got appointed nepotistically.
1791300	1794300	That isn't enough and shouldn't be enough to throw the entire case out, right?
1794600	1795000	Mm hmm.
1795900	1797900	Maybe no, no, hold on.
1798500	1809500	It would throw him and Fannie Willis off the case and probably be put under a different County da to coordinate and redo the entire thing because you're true because that's probably true.
1809500	1820600	Yes, everything everything in its case at the moment would be under suspect and judges would be really really hesitant to touch it unless they like it's been gone through with a fine to come.
1821100	1825700	Yeah, I don't you mean like they might say okay, like you two are clearly corrupt and you're scratching each other's backs.
1825700	1827900	We're going to get different prosecutors and like you guys are gone.
1828300	1829400	So that might be the case.
1829400	1837400	Yes, but in terms of disqualifying the whole thing solely because she brought her her boyfriend on board.
1837400	1839400	I don't see that being legitimate frankly.
1839800	1850300	Now the real question this is why I think with you were on that you're on the money is that the real question is why did he meet with the White House because I do think that there are actually good reasons as to why a person in his
1850300	1862200	position might do so well if you are prosecuting Trump and there might be legitimate information to let me finish it.
1862200	1869400	I let you finish things there might be legitimate information to come out of Biden himself or from other people working at the White House or from the White House office.
1869700	1877300	It seems reasonable that the prosecutor would go to people involved which includes people at the White House and ask them about it.
1877700	1883000	Yeah, so though that's that's kind of post hoc because this was he was he went there beforehand.
1883000	1883400	Sure.
1883400	1885800	He was even as a prosecutor.
1885800	1890900	But you're alleging that there can be no other reason than malfeasance for this to happen.
1890900	1897700	That is what you were you were kind of implying with your statements that the only reason that they could have a meeting is for corruption.
1898000	1903800	And if there are other reasons where it would be legitimate like Dev said yes, it's post hoc.
1903800	1910900	But the fact is we were how we're all having to like post hoc this because none of us have the information of what they were actually meeting about.
1910900	1912800	I'm not privy to those are at information.
1913000	1913600	Are you?
1914800	1916500	No, that's just what you avoid doing.
1916500	1917700	He's speculating.
1917900	1919300	We're all speculating.
1919400	1928600	We're all making guesses about what may or may not have and our biases obviously will make us lean one way or the other now again.
1929100	1935300	What should happen is they should be forthwith and like tell people right?
1935300	1938800	I'm all for more transparency and all these processes, right?
1938800	1943600	And so unless it violates some kind of national security risk, which it might or anything.
1944100	1949000	I think it's perfectly fine to release the logs of the meetings and things like that.
1949000	1958300	So so when a person is anointed through nepotistic and corrupt methods, it is not up to the people launching an issue with it to have to then prove that his
1958300	1964500	meeting with somebody he was he's not supposed to meet with would ever be anything other than proper.
1964700	1974800	Okay, it is up to the person that was corruptly anointed to show that their meeting was above board, which can be done through minutes or communication.
1974800	1976400	I guess we'll see if it is or not.
1976700	1982300	That's not that's not up to the people having an issue with a clearly ethics violation.
1982500	1985100	His issue to reveal that to isn't to you.
1985300	1987000	It's to the no, no, no, it is it.
1987000	1988000	No, it's to everybody.
1988000	1994600	That would be why, why, why, why, why, why, what, what obligation does he have to tell you shit, right?
1994600	1997900	Like you want to know, well, you're on the jury.
1998100	1999200	You're not in the county.
1999200	2000400	I don't believe right.
2000500	2004200	Is he he was selected as a public official.
2004200	2008800	So he is now when he is as a running as working as a public official.
2008800	2017900	He is now held to the standard of public officials, which is recording those things and then keeping that sure and releasing it to the people who need
2017900	2025200	to know, right, which in this case would be the court system, the judges involved in the case and the public.
2025200	2026800	It was because those things are publicly filed.
2026800	2027200	Yes.
2027300	2028700	So hold on, hold on, hold on.
2029100	2032000	This also seems kind of post hoc, though, Artemis.
2032000	2032300	Why?
2033100	2041200	So what as as you said earlier, when he he talked to he went to the White House in May and then again in November, right?
2041400	2042700	He hadn't been appointed.
2043700	2048100	He hadn't been appointed this in this public council position yet, right?
2048100	2050600	Yes, which is the issue, right?
2051300	2065100	So it could be the case that they knew they were going to appoint him and the and she sent him along to do some sort of secret talks, hoping that it wouldn't come up and said, you know, I'm going to point you in a few months.
2065100	2070700	You go do this right now and that, you know, even as described, that could be OK, depending.
2070700	2071200	I'm not sure.
2071600	2073700	However, sure, it's not OK.
2074200	2078800	We have secret talks when you're when you're working as a in your official capacity as a prosecutor.
2079300	2079700	He wasn't.
2079800	2081100	No, no, no, he wasn't working.
2081100	2081600	No, no, no, no.
2082000	2082500	That's the point.
2082600	2083600	And he wasn't working.
2084100	2085400	He wasn't working in a capacity.
2085600	2085900	Hold on.
2085900	2086800	Fanny was can't.
2086800	2090400	Fanny Willis can't send him to do that in a secret way.
2090600	2091300	That's that.
2091300	2093200	But it would be her problem, not his.
2093200	2093800	It would be her problem.
2093800	2094200	Not his.
2094200	2101000	Yeah, but it's but it's OK, but it still comes back to affecting the case because she said to me clandestinely to go talk to the political.
2101700	2105300	The enemy political enemy of the person getting prosecuted.
2106000	2110100	Well, all I'm hearing from this is I got to find someone that I can sleep with.
2110100	2112800	That'll suit me to the moon.
2112800	2114800	That will get me into the big leagues.
2114800	2116100	Who do I got to sleep with?
2116100	2117100	Is that how it is?
2117500	2121300	Apparently, apparently, according to so here's the thing, right?
2121300	2128300	Like because he did this before actually working in an official capacity, it could be have been for anything.
2128300	2129800	And that's really the point here, right?
2130400	2136700	Which is why you avoid ever having brought him into the prosecutorial position in the first place.
2137800	2145000	Well, I think actually that brings up a problem because now you're saying I can't bring in any lawyer who has ever talked to the president because someone might dig through it and discover that.
2146400	2149200	Sure, that's you have an infinite amount of lawyers.
2149200	2153100	You can pull through across the country for being an infinite amount of lawyers.
2153700	2160900	I mean, here, here, how about he had other reasons to go to like work-related reasons to go to the White House.
2162900	2169500	Okay, so hypothetically, let's say he has work-related reasons to go to the White House for some other case or some other instance or something else going on, right?
2170000	2176100	And so he has those two meetings and then he gets hired nepotistically by his girlfriend, right?
2176100	2182800	Now that makes it that makes not his meetings the problem, but the nepotistic hiring the problem, right?
2183100	2190200	All right, I'm going to make this a really easy one for you to understand and there was a wrap this up after this because we do have more people in line.
2190200	2192600	Do you remember a infamous tarmac meeting?
2193700	2198800	Which one the Loretta Lynch Clinton meeting was that?
2198800	2204800	No, I don't you got to remind me of this where they decided that I'm pretty sure it hold on.
2206100	2208100	Let me let me bring it up that way.
2214100	2220500	I guess what I'm saying, I guess what I'm saying basically Artemis is that everything that you're saying is possible.
2220500	2225100	It is more likely than but we do not have enough evidence for it yet.
2225100	2228100	And now I want to see more evidence for it, but it is possible.
2228100	2242400	Yes, so I'll send you the the Loretta Lynch Clinton story about the meeting on the tarmac without for no reason apparently, but that, you know, people can claim is above board and that nothing happened.
2242600	2253300	But the the the resulting actions after that meeting led to a reversing in the expected outcomes of cases.
2255600	2261200	So also the the person broke the story ended up dead, but that's that's a different reason.
2261200	2269500	There's all these implications and everything you're saying is like, oh, and also they ended up dead.
2269500	2276600	I wonder why I mean that I know why, but isn't it weird that he ended up dead?
2276600	2277800	Isn't it weird?
2277800	2291600	But there is the issue is that the there's the tarmac meeting is a really good example of where people would have to recuse themselves regardless of what was talked about on that plane on the tarmac.
2291600	2303200	The you cannot have somebody in any fashion overseeing a case when the person that the case is involved is the person you like representative you talk to on a plane where no one else could hear it.
2304400	2308000	Well, tell you what, Artemis, thank you for bringing this to my attention.
2308000	2310900	I'll check it out because again, I don't want to take your word for it.
2310900	2314700	I wouldn't take Dev's word for it or anyone's on the Internet's word for it.
2314700	2323100	I'll look into some some more check out some articles, see what they got and see if I can't find if there's any more information out there.
2323100	2325400	But I do appreciate you calling in, buddy.
2325400	2327200	Thanks for coming by.
2327700	2329000	And for now, though.
2330800	2337800	I'll send you away, send you to the void, as I say, I think you get a chance to reply to that last thing.
2338000	2339500	Well, what did you want to say?
2339900	2345100	I guess the TLDR is that the things that Artemis present sometimes are just crazy.
2345100	2347700	There's other conversations we've had where he's just I think he's just been wrong.
2348100	2352100	But like this, this is possible, but there's not enough evidence.
2352100	2352600	We have to wait.
2353000	2355900	That's all you're going to lose your right wing cred, buddy.
2355900	2361900	Like people tell people tell me that you're this crypto tanky guy.
2362700	2363200	Thank you.
2363200	2363600	Right.
2363600	2363900	All right.
2363900	2365700	Maybe a crypto communist.
2365900	2366500	Well, thank you.
2366500	2369500	Your communist is anyone who goes for Biden and certain people.
2369500	2370200	OK, right.
2370500	2376200	So, you know, like so not believing the conspiracy theory right off the bat.
2376200	2377100	What are you doing?
2377100	2378000	What's going on?
2378900	2380000	But gang?
2380300	2380500	Yeah.
2380500	2385700	If you want to call in, if you'd like to talk to us about something, it could be political.
2385700	2387700	It could be cultural, could be anything you'd like.
2389400	2390700	Hit the Discord link.
2390700	2392200	I'll put it in chats.
2392800	2394900	Escalation board, Discord and the Twitch chat.
2395300	2397900	Click the link, accept the rules, jump backstage, we'll pull you on.
2397900	2398900	Let's get to our next caller.
2398900	2400600	Whoa, they were here.
2401000	2401800	They were here just a minute ago.
2401800	2404200	There was people here, but then they vanished.
2404200	2405900	Because they got they got impatient.
2406900	2408500	And this is what happens, right?
2408600	2413200	They get in, they want to call and then they're like, oh, man, this is taking too long.
2413200	2414000	And then they'll just dip.
2414100	2414700	Oh, there we go.
2414800	2415300	Here we go.
2416700	2417700	Allison, hello.
2420900	2421600	You're live.
2422500	2423400	Can you hear me?
2423900	2425000	I can hear you.
2425000	2425300	Hi.
2426300	2426800	Hi.
2426800	2428800	I don't have the camera today, if that's okay.
2429200	2432200	That's, no one has the camera in, except for me in this place.
2432200	2432700	So go ahead.
2434100	2444100	Okay, well, okay, I listen to NPR Up First every morning, and I listen to the Daily Wire's shameless ripoff of NPR Up First every morning.
2444100	2451100	Okay, so I get the little like mainstream right and left daily news perspectives and like, I'm subscribed to the times.
2451100	2455000	And I'm just like seeing constant reports about immigration all of a sudden.
2455000	2456600	I know it's always a big issue.
2456900	2472600	But I swear the last like five weeks, I just see article after article about like, Democrat mayor is pissed off about immigration, like New York suing bus companies that complied with Abbott's orders, like Biden suing to cut the razor wire in Texas.
2472600	2475300	He previously sued to get the floating barriers.
2475300	2484000	But it's like one after, I don't know if I'm just like maybe on alert for it because these fucking commenters keep telling me it's really going to affect the election in 2024.
2484000	2485500	This is going to be a big fucking deal.
2485700	2489400	I don't know if the priming has worked or whatever, but I just like keep noticing it.
2489400	2491900	Is this like a real thing or what's going on?
2493100	2500600	I mean, immigration has been a hot button issue since Build the Wall in 2016, right?
2500600	2502100	Like, or even before then.
2502800	2508000	So I don't, yeah, it absolutely is something that is a political football that's going to be tossed around.
2508500	2512700	There's people going to have big hyperbolic takes on it.
2513000	2516200	And there's more and more lawsuits, like more and more legal action.
2516200	2521800	I don't think it's just people talking like I think like shit is happening in courts more and more.
2522900	2523500	What do you mean?
2524500	2532800	Like, okay, so New York did just sue all those bus companies that complied with Abbott's busing efforts to sanctuary cities.
2533100	2539000	So the implication there is that they're trying to like stop private companies from like complying with the Texas governor's order.
2539400	2549200	In the past, Biden successfully, or his administration successfully sued to get the floating barriers in the Rio Grande removed, calling them an environmental hazard.
2549400	2554900	He's currently suing to cut the razor wire border on Texas.
2555100	2571700	And then also Texas recently criminalized crossing the border illegally on the state level, which would give Texas state cops the ability to like detain suspected illegal border crossers and like deport them or like refer them to ICE for deportation.
2572300	2582300	And so Biden's like, it's like, specifically, there's more and more legal fights between Greg Abbott and Biden's administration or related parties like the state of New York.
2582500	2585700	But it's just interesting to me.
2585700	2589100	It's like an interesting little I don't know.
2590300	2596900	You know, I don't understand why Americans are weird about their borders, like most other countries are like, oh, yeah, you can't come through.
2597500	2598700	That's just how it is.
2599100	2602400	How come there's so much for a second?
2602400	2603700	Can you repeat that last thing?
2604000	2604700	Okay, sure, sure.
2605500	2615100	I don't understand why Americans are weird about their borders because in every other country, it's like, yeah, you can't come into the country without going through a proper border crossing and you can't just can't just jump the border.
2615300	2617200	That's normal everywhere else.
2617400	2624600	Why is it that when it comes to the American Mexican border, you have people screaming that it's somehow racist to build a wall?
2624700	2625700	It's like, what the fuck?
2625700	2627900	Like other countries have walls is no big deal.
2627900	2629500	Like what's what's going on here?
2631800	2643300	I mean, I mean, also another steel man, the other side, they'd be like, well, we don't want that even though it's normal in other countries, like it's normal in other countries to pressure a population, right?
2643600	2644300	Do we want that?
2644300	2645400	Obviously not.
2645900	2647600	We could look at the EU, right?
2647600	2660700	In other multinational conglomerates, if you will, that have treaties that allow free movement between countries without any of these border restrictions and things like that.
2660700	2667100	So while yes, in many countries, it is normalized to have a straight, strict border security.
2667300	2668300	That's not the case everywhere.
2670100	2672800	Yeah, but I mean, Americans don't have that kind of news.
2673500	2681500	Oh, sorry, the Republicans have tied Israel and Ukraine aid to like a certain number of what they would say is common sense immigration reform.
2681700	2688300	Other people would say really conservative, harsh, harsh on people who are just trying to make it for themselves and their children.
2688600	2689500	So it like depends.
2689500	2691100	But that's another thing that's happening right now.
2693100	2696400	Well, I mean, if you wanted to start cutting deals, that's how you would do it, right?
2696400	2699100	It's like the conservatives want something, the liberals want something else.
2699900	2700800	You make a deal.
2701700	2703700	You reduce immigration, you get more aid.
2703700	2705200	I mean, it seems like it's a fair trade.
2706700	2716600	I feel like the Democrats, I mean, again, maybe I'm like buying the hype because all these like commentariat people keep implying that like the Democrats will probably be electorally punished for this.
2716600	2718700	Like this doesn't seem to be very popular.
2718700	2725500	Apparently, immigration is the issue that Biden consistently polls lowest in terms of confidence for voters.
2725500	2726000	We did have it.
2726000	2728100	It's like, are you sure about that?
2728700	2731200	Because I'm pretty sure it would be Israel-Palestine at this point.
2732200	2737700	Oh, I don't think it's like the top one, but it's amongst the top like three, I think, immigration is.
2738600	2742100	Well, but I don't know that it's like number one, least confident.
2742100	2748600	To that point, there was a recent poll out where I guess Biden's approval rating is only at 38%.
2748600	2750000	It's very, very low.
2751000	2752600	And it is an issue, right?
2752900	2763400	I think Biden's low approval numbers are going to have an impact going forward, but I don't think it's caused to panic as of yet.
2763400	2771000	I think this might change going into the general as one, the economy gets better and continues to improve, right?
2771000	2775100	There's a lot of really good signs that the economy is trending upward right now.
2777000	2778400	But yeah, we'll have to see.
2779000	2781900	There's some signs that might be trending downward, though.
2782000	2787000	I mean, I've heard that layoffs are coming in the next six months, like big layoffs are coming.
2788100	2790500	Oh, so they might come in the future.
2790500	2795500	Maybe, but like I believe it was the Wall Street Journal.
2795600	2804400	I could be wrong on who reported this, but in December wage increase surpassed inflation increase, right?
2804400	2808400	And that's been something that's been underwater since COVID for a long time.
2808900	2811900	And it's now kind of finally kind of surpassed that.
2811900	2814300	So it's not entirely fixed yet.
2814300	2815900	There are still some big problems.
2816600	2823900	But again, trends that I'm seeing are all pointing to things are going to get better.
2823900	2826400	Now, will that actually affect his poll numbers?
2826700	2827800	We'll see, right?
2828200	2835200	And when it comes to immigration to your topic, Alison, I don't know.
2835200	2840700	Like, I don't know if that's going to be the big issue of 2024.
2840800	2842200	I really don't, but I could be wrong.
2844200	2845300	We shall see.
2845500	2846000	We shall see.
2846000	2847500	Is there anything else you have for us today?
2849300	2850400	No, that's really it.
2850400	2853400	I see you have the line again, so I'll let you go.
2853500	2855700	Okay, Alison, thank you for calling in.
2856100	2856800	And I will talk to you.
2856800	2857300	Bye.
2858000	2858400	Bye.
2861100	2864900	Yeah, so what other signs, just before bringing the next caller, I'm just curious.
2864900	2869800	Other than the layouts, what other signs do you see that the economy is getting worse?
2870700	2871500	That was the main one.
2871800	2872200	That was it.
2872200	2872500	Fair enough.
2873500	2874500	It might be true, right?
2874500	2878600	Like, we can only guess at the future.
2878700	2879400	We'll have to see.
2880000	2884300	Five dollars from Artemis Fowl says, Wick, tell people about the Muslim Uber driver I told you about.
2884300	2884800	I will.
2885000	2887900	We're going to let some callers get in and get stories in too, though, right?
2888100	2889600	This is a community event.
2889600	2892800	Okay, but I'll tell that story if the line dies down.
2892800	2893900	Let me bring in the next caller.
2895700	2896600	Hello, you're live.
2901200	2901600	Hello.
2902600	2905700	Hello, so I have a stupid question and then I have a serious question.
2906300	2909400	The stupid question is, what do you like better, Pokemon or Digimon?
2910500	2910900	Hello.
2911700	2912000	Hi.
2912300	2918900	Hi, so I'm not that familiar with Digimon, so if I had to choose between the two, I'll go with Pokemon because it's more familiar.
2919100	2919500	That's me.
2921200	2921700	Hold on a second.
2921700	2922100	Hold on.
2922100	2922600	Hold on a second.
2922600	2923800	I'm having a problem here.
2924000	2924500	Give me a second.
2925900	2928000	Okay, no.
2928000	2928600	Hi, Sparkles.
2928600	2929300	What's going on?
2930300	2930700	Hi.
2931200	2931900	Well, okay.
2931900	2935200	So I've been seeing this word neoliberal a lot.
2935200	2935800	What does it mean?
2937500	2938500	That's who's saying it.
2939400	2943500	Neoliberal is usually thrown around as an insult.
2945900	2948400	I don't know the precise definition.
2948600	2949700	Let's Wikipedia it.
2949700	2954600	Okay, so neoliberalism is a term used to signify.
2954600	2965300	The late 20th century political reappearance of 19th century ideas associated with free market capitalism, which had fallen into decline following the Second World War.
2966900	2967400	Let's see.
2973700	2977000	All I know is that if someone calls me a neoliberal, they're not wishing me.
2977000	2981500	Well, okay, they're not one by you piece of shit.
2981700	2983200	Neoliberal shit.
2984000	2993100	One impetus for the formulation of policies to mitigate capitalist free market volatility was a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the 1930s.
2994200	3008400	And policymaking neoliberalism often refers to what what often refers to what was part of a paradigm shift that followed the perceived failure of the post-war consensus and Keynesian economics to address the stagflation of the 1970s.
3008800	3009000	Okay.
3009000	3010800	Yeah, so so basically.
3011300	3017300	From what I basically understand is after the end of the Second World War up until pretty much the 1970s.
3017600	3025400	You had a lot of a lot of like Social Democrats are the ones who were paving the way in the various mainstream left-wing parties in the world.
3025600	3031000	Lots of high taxation and lots of lots of lots of social spending, right?
3031400	3036700	But you did that for about 30 or 40 years and the economy eventually stagnated.
3037000	3043900	So you so with the neoliberals basically came in with them with Ronald Reagan and Reagan's idea was hold on, hold on, hold on.
3043900	3047300	How about and we don't necessarily need to get rid of all the social spending.
3047300	3061600	But how about we cut some of this regulation to allow people to be able to more easily work and companies to be built and there's more economic growth and there's more prosperity and that basically worked and was the political paradigm of the West.
3061600	3062700	I think until Trump.
3063700	3066300	They get lasted from Reagan to Trump neoliberals.
3067200	3069900	They called Nikki Haley and neoliberal.
3070400	3079900	Yeah, so so the the left will often use neoliberal as an insult towards people who maybe they have some.
3081300	3087200	Some more progressive social views like on gay marriage or something like that, but ultimately they're very pro-capitalist.
3087200	3088700	They're not socialists at all.
3089400	3105300	So they use neoliberal as an insult and they did what they basically mean is like, you know, fake revolutionary or you know, like a capital like rainbow capitalism is also kind of related to this idea where it's like somebody who's very inclusive socially, but still ultimately a capitalist.
3105500	3107600	It's like a socialist slur basically.
3108500	3110300	It was a conservative guy that said it.
3111200	3117200	Okay, so when conservatives use the word neoliberal as an insult, it's also not good.
3117200	3128200	So when conservatives do it, they're basically saying like neoliberals are trying to appeal to the economics of the right, but they tax too high and they're too progressive for our tastes.
3128900	3130400	Okay, okay, that makes sense now.
3130400	3130900	Okay, thank you.
3130900	3133800	Yeah, it's used as an insult by both sides.
3134800	3136800	Cuz at first I was like, I don't yeah.
3136800	3137200	Okay.
3137200	3148500	Cuz he I cuz he would say that she wanted to be the vice president be if Trump she they want Trump to have her as a would be his vice president.
3148500	3150400	I think she said she would do that if she was asked.
3150400	3150800	Yeah.
3151700	3152000	Yeah.
3152000	3152200	Yeah.
3152200	3152400	Yeah.
3152400	3153800	She said yeah, but he said no.
3153800	3154400	He said no.
3154500	3155100	He doesn't want her.
3155100	3155800	Yeah, not at all.
3155900	3156100	Yeah.
3156300	3158400	No, there's there's there's no fucking way that he would.
3158400	3158700	Yeah.
3158700	3160400	How do you Dev?
3160400	3163600	How do you respond to the accusations that you're a neoliberal?
3164500	3167400	I might be I mean, it sounds like here's the thing.
3167600	3171500	If you look at you know, the the Golden Age of the neoliberals things are pretty good.
3171900	3173300	Yeah, the nifty 90s.
3173300	3174200	It was a good time.
3174700	3175400	Can't complain.
3176000	3181000	You know, if it turned out that I was just a neoliberal in the end after everything was boiled down.
3181200	3182100	I'd be fine with that.
3182500	3183500	I don't hate neoliberals.
3184400	3188000	I think liberals hold on a bad rap in general, right?
3188200	3191100	I think that more and more cry.
3191100	3193200	I don't buck against the label.
3193600	3196700	If you want to call me a liberal kind of okay.
3196700	3198300	I'm definitely I'm definitely a liberal.
3198300	3198700	Yes.
3198900	3200300	Also the men it sparkles.
3200300	3201000	I think sparkles.
3201000	3202400	You've been watching me for years now.
3202600	3204200	It's the first time we've spoken sparkles.
3204200	3204800	I think it is.
3205500	3208500	It is I've been saying voice messages before but we've never talked about.
3209000	3210200	Oh, no, right, right.
3210200	3211800	Is this a first time?
3212700	3213400	No, you okay.
3213400	3214900	It's not a stalker situation.
3214900	3215600	Is it or no?
3215600	3216100	No, it's fine.
3216100	3216300	It's fine.
3216300	3218000	It's okay.
3219600	3221500	No, you've been watching me for years and years.
3222500	3228500	So what I what I recall is there's been and you've certainly seen this sparkles.
3228500	3237500	There's been so many people who get mad at me when they finally realize that I actually am a liberal and I haven't been dog-whistling this whole time.
3238500	3246600	And it happens pretty regularly where it's like we you're actually a liberal and you're not you know, someone who says they're a liberal but you're actually far left or far right.
3246600	3249500	It's like no, I'm not no, I'm actually a liberal.
3250300	3253700	All the time I don't understand the commie you get called that all the time.
3254200	3254500	Yeah.
3254500	3254700	Yeah.
3254700	3272500	Yeah, people who are more who are way more right-leaning than me call me communist all the time and what they mean by communist is basically somebody who is in any way even just slightly progressive socially or believes in some level of taxation that isn't zero.
3273500	3275100	That's what they mean by communist.
3276100	3281700	And then and then you have like you have people on Twitter or you have like BreadTubers or something.
3281700	3290700	I've heard Vashj say this about me a handful of times that like I'm a fascist right or I'm alt-right or I'm some sort of not like neo-nazi or right way something right something.
3290700	3292700	Yeah, crypto fascist.
3292700	3293700	I thought he just called you a fatchus.
3293700	3294700	A fat, what did he say?
3294700	3295200	A fatchus.
3295200	3296200	Yeah, a fatchus.
3296200	3297200	Is that me?
3302200	3303200	He's annoying anyway.
3303200	3304200	Vashj.
3304200	3304700	Yeah.
3305200	3310700	I mean, I've heard that maybe he's he's like slightly maybe one drop de-radicalizing.
3310700	3311500	I don't believe it though.
3311500	3316200	But I mean, he's he's slowly he's slowly coming out of the Fortress Ark.
3316200	3335000	I've had a I've had him on my stream once before generally look, he's a nice enough gentleman when you interact with him one-to-one I have substantive disagreements with I think some of the ways he handles himself but in a lot of other ways.
3335100	3357800	I actually agree with him and in some ways right like I think that there is something to the to be said about critiques of capitalism and critiques of more fascistic or more right-leaning institutions and groups and things like that, but you just can't the my problem my biggest problem with him is he can't believe anything.
3357800	3362000	He says you have to research it on your own because he'll just go with things.
3362000	3376700	The funniest clip I saw was him reviewing the terrorist attack in Iran where they blew up a bunch of people attending this Memorial for so many.
3376700	3380700	I believe it was and he's watching this and he's the whole time.
3380700	3382600	He's blaming Israel like oh Israel.
3382600	3383800	This has to be a girl.
3383800	3391900	I'm like calling it and it's Israel Israel did this Israel did this it definitely is and then like a week later Isis takes responsibility for the attacks.
3391900	3396600	And so you can't really trust him, but he's fine.
3396600	3397100	I know what you mean.
3397100	3403600	What about Tacoma and I live by Tacoma and Tacoma has lead in the water and lead in the water can make it more aggressive.
3403600	3405000	So maybe that's part of his issue.
3406000	3406700	You think so?
3407000	3408000	I think he's rich enough.
3408000	3410500	He doesn't drink the poor's water right?
3410500	3411900	He probably gets some bottles.
3412100	3415000	Bye I could be wrong, but thank you for calling in Miss Sparkles.
3415000	3416200	Is there anything else you have for us?
3417100	3418500	Digimon is better than Pokemon.
3418500	3418900	That's it.
3418900	3419100	Bye.
3419100	3419800	Why?
3421900	3422800	Why though?
3422900	3423900	Why is it better?
3424400	3425500	I'm not sure it is.
3425900	3428600	Did you mind like they're basically the same thing, right?
3428600	3433100	You you catch the animal you raise them and you train them to battle other animals.
3434500	3439500	No, did you Mon like like each human like there's like special humans who are given one.
3440900	3450200	And it's like it's like like their permanent partner and they only have one and they go on these adventures where they temporarily evolve them, but they devolve after the battle.
3450200	3451000	It's different.
3451000	3456600	But it was definitely like it was definitely made in the wake of the Pokemon craze in the 90s.
3457700	3458900	Fair enough, fair enough.
3458900	3461800	Look, I I missed that.
3461800	3463300	I never grew up with that.
3463300	3466300	I played a few Pokemon games and it's fun for what it is.
3466300	3470100	It's just not something that really like captured me.
3470100	3471900	Let's bring on the the next guest.
3471900	3473700	I'm not sure which one of y'all joined first.
3473700	3476300	So I'm just gonna I'm just gonna guess and we'll find out.
3478100	3479200	Hello, you're live.

3488300	3489000	We'll try it again.
3490500	3491900	Sorry, sorry.
3491900	3494600	Hello, can you hear me?
3494600	3497100	Vaguely, you're very low.

3516200	3517700	Give what needs the money now.
3517700	3518300	Give it to him.
3518300	3521000	Okay, so you'll be a vtuber wick.
3521000	3521900	You'll make money that way.
3522700	3523900	What are you trying to say?
3524300	3524500	Please?
3524500	3529900	No, I don't know if you guys have talked about this but this
3529900	3534600	is something I got into a bit of a discussion conversation
3534600	3538400	with a friend of mine coming back did a long drive from
3538400	3542000	Gen Con when the first Trump and diamonds really were coming
3542000	3548700	down and something okay first premise first kind of given
3548700	3554500	I guess is would Trump fans revolt would Trump cultists
3554500	3560800	or whatever fans people who want to vote for Trump if he's
3560800	3562700	indicted on every charge.
3562800	3566200	Well, look what they did in January 6 after he didn't win
3566200	3567100	the election, right?
3567100	3568400	That's that's what I'm saying.
3568400	3571500	So there would be a lot of to be clear like like en masse
3571500	3576100	nothing en masse what they do is nothing but there would be
3576700	3581200	let's say very small minority of very hyper partisan people
3581200	3583500	that would do some terrible shit.
3583500	3583800	Now.
3583900	3587300	This isn't unique to Trump right and a lot of people will
3587300	3592000	say it is but it's not I read a story recently.
3593700	3597500	That has made me kind of wonder if the reason we don't see
3597500	3603200	as much left-wing violence is because left-wing hard left-wingers
3603200	3604400	are just retarded.
3604400	3607800	There is a man in 2020.
3607800	3611900	I believe who the only reason the mayor of this the Jewish
3611900	3615100	mayor of this town is still alive is because this guy was
3615100	3617600	so incompetent in his assassination attempts.
3617600	3621000	He failed twice like he went there to kill him, but he loaded
3621000	3626500	the bullet backwards and the gun advocating for more gun
3627100	3629000	training for leftist is what I'm here.
3629000	3632800	I don't I don't know but it was just it was wild.
3632800	3634000	So it's embarrassing.
3634000	3634400	Yeah.
3634900	3635400	So here's the thing.
3635400	3636200	I've been thinking of it.
3636200	3639900	So everyone always says that right wingers are more violent
3639900	3641000	than left-wingers and you ask him.
3641000	3642400	Why do you say that?
3642500	3643700	I wouldn't agree with that statement.
3643900	3647100	Yeah, I know I know but like when when when asked if they
3647100	3649300	give you the proper answer the proper answer is that there's
3649300	3652900	some sort of database that is divided up different types
3652900	3654800	of violence, right?
3655100	3656400	And I think it divides it.
3656900	3658400	There's like hmm.
3658900	3661100	Was it left-wing right-wing and libertarian?
3661100	3662600	It might be that's what it might be.
3663000	3667500	But anyway, and like the overwhelming amount of of violence
3667500	3668400	is committed by right wingers.
3668400	3669300	I'm like, well, this is very interesting.
3669300	3672000	So I never never and it's like three years ago.
3672000	3673800	I never I never got around to doing it, but I should eventually
3673800	3677200	take some time and do it but I decided to like click on some
3677200	3680500	random instances of what they called in their database
3680500	3683600	of right-wing violence and a few of them were was legitimate
3683600	3685900	right-wing violence like violence for a political purpose.
3686100	3690000	But one of them was like there was a neo-nazi.
3690000	3692500	He was like a skinhead and he had like like swastikas tattooed
3692500	3693700	all over his body, right?
3694300	3699000	And he killed his mother and went to jail and that person
3699000	3700900	was flagged as right-wing violence.
3700900	3701600	I'm like, well, hold on.
3701600	3704300	I mean, he he seemed to kill his mother.
3704700	3709800	No, but like he seemed to kill his mother because his mother
3709800	3711200	was abusive, right?
3711500	3715900	And then the end of the situation is like, well, Is that
3715900	3719100	right-wing violence because a right-winger did it even though
3719100	3720800	there's no political motivation for the violence.
3720800	3721500	It was personal.
3721700	3723600	That doesn't seem to be that doesn't seem to be properly
3723600	3726100	filed. So at some point I was like, I'm going to sit down
3726100	3730700	with this 10,000 strong entry list and go through them that
3730700	3731600	I forgot to do it.
3731600	3732400	And I was like three years ago.
3732400	3743800	I forgot to do it and then like I keep thinking about it
3743800	3745600	like once every three months like I should do that and I
3745600	3748000	just I just don't well, it's something you keep hearing
3748000	3750800	right? You keep hearing that all right wingers commit more
3750800	3752600	violence in the West, right?
3752600	3756800	You hear that all the time and again, it might be true as
3756800	3761000	far as I know but but what I'm scared of, you know for this
3761000	3764400	premise really is to look back at January 6 and I'm scared
3764400	3768200	of people like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz the button, you know,
3768200	3772800	the banality of evil how simple it was for them to just keep
3772800	3776900	saying well we object on behalf of you know, whatever other
3776900	3780700	state, you know, we want them to recertify their election
3780700	3783500	call new slates that that's what I'm scared of.
3783500	3788600	I what I don't like to see is when you have groups of people
3788600	3795600	that are in power who are scared of their own base by the
3795600	3800400	leader Trump scared into a position where they have to now
3800400	3801500	go. Okay.
3801500	3803500	Are we actively supporting this coup?
3803600	3805700	Can we tepidly support this coup?
3805900	3810200	Can we you know, you know back it up and just use our political
3810200	3813700	rhetoric speech where we say we fight like hell and we do,
3813700	3816800	you know, because we have so many sick fans that will defend
3816800	3817600	this online.
3817900	3822600	And even when all the facts and truth and how hours and hours
3822600	3824900	and videos out there.
3825200	3828700	It's easy to just have someone like Alex Jones say they were
3828700	3830000	led into the Capitol.
3830000	3833700	I was there, you know, and and at the same time and Tifa did
3833700	3838100	it so that so my whole the premise of the question was let's
3838100	3844800	say there's a legitimate threat from conservatives that let's
3844800	3850100	say Ted Cruz Jim Jordan many other conservative Republican
3850300	3854500	lawmakers. Okay, I'm not saying the Alex Jones people I'm
3854500	3860100	talking about lawmakers who say if Trump, you know, you know
3860100	3866100	gets charged now he's charged now he's going to go to prison
3866900	3873500	if he is actually going to be not acquitted and we're going
3873500	3876300	to put him into prison because of that, you know, that's
3876300	3878900	the ramifications of the things he's done.
3879700	3883900	We will, you know, try to succeed from the Union or fuck
3883900	3887000	them are like I don't care if it's a credible threat.
3887200	3887900	They alike.
3887900	3892600	Look if it goes through the courts the courts make the decision
3892600	3896600	and find that there is wrongdoing and he is something beyond
3896600	3900200	a reasonable doubt guilty of these things and it carries
3900200	3902600	a sentence that includes jail time and he's sentenced to
3902600	3907900	jail time and then people are going to revolt because they
3907900	3912200	think that he should be above the law not fuck that.
3912400	3914000	No, I don't care.
3914000	3919800	Like if you we have to at least put the law above being fearful
3919800	3921300	of how people will respond to law.
3921300	3923400	That's my instinct on this.
3923400	3928400	I understand what you're saying my whole premise to relied
3928400	3932500	on the fact that Biden to try to keep the country United
3932900	3937800	would announce before the election that he would acquit,
3937800	3940900	you know, he would pardon Trump because I think about Nixon.
3941000	3943500	I think about when's the last time something like this has
3943500	3946500	ever happened in United States history and it was with Nixon
3946500	3950300	Nixon did the you know, he tried to tamper with the election.
3950600	3954400	He you know got information from his political opponents
3954800	3961300	and lied constantly constantly until he was finally backed
3961300	3967000	up into a wall where he had to completely give up power and
3967000	3971900	I firmly believe that if Nick Nixon did what he did today,
3972200	3976500	he would only could get away with it just because the internet
3976500	3977800	and the way the internet works.
3978000	3983400	There's no way that he would not fight it more than someone
3983400	3985500	like Trump and especially have the character of someone like
3985500	3990300	Trump and what did we do to Nixon, you know, we completely
3990300	3992400	pardoned him Ford pardoned him.
3992400	3995200	That was the first thing he did when he got into power when
3995200	3999900	he became president to forgive the country right to you know,
3999900	4002700	like I said, I don't know if that will I don't know if that'll
4003400	4004900	that'll heal what divides us.
4004900	4009400	What do you think Dev given that premise you're in charge
4009400	4010300	your king for a day.
4010600	4013800	Do you go ahead and pardon Trump or do you just let the
4013800	4015600	consequences play out?
4016700	4018700	I mean, yeah, he's guilty is guilty right and that's how
4018700	4020100	it should be obviously.
4020700	4023800	But I mean the the question is basically like if it if it
4023800	4026100	turns out that Trump is legitimately guilty.
4026600	4029700	However, punishing him would lead to a riot and possibly
4029700	4030400	a civil war.
4030400	4035700	Do you do so the moralist in me says that you have to because
4036100	4039100	if you don't what where does that lead down the road, right?
4039300	4041500	You have somebody who does all this shit and just because
4041500	4043700	he's popular going to let him not do it.
4044800	4048200	I mean, you know, you're gonna let me get away with it like
4048200	4051000	that sounds like it's a terrible precedent to set.
4051000	4054000	I mean some some more cynical people will say well, you know,
4054200	4055900	the rich and powerful and connected they already get away
4055900	4058000	with it and to some extent they do already get away with
4058000	4061200	it. But do you do you want to codify that as the actual
4061200	4062800	overt standard?
4063200	4064000	I don't think we do.
4064200	4068000	I mean is there I mean his whole thing was that I he would
4068000	4071900	not vote for Biden if he announced that he would pardon Trump
4072000	4075800	because how can we let the you know, someone get away with
4075800	4078100	the rule of law and I guess that's another question.
4078100	4081300	Would you vote for Biden if he says this is something I'm
4081300	4084800	not in one issue right with them.
4084800	4088500	I would say that call but uh, I don't need my politicians
4088500	4091200	to be perfect and perfectly aligned with my values to vote
4091200	4091400	for them.
4091400	4091800	Sure.
4092100	4092300	Sure.
4092300	4092500	Sure.
4092500	4092700	Sure.
4092700	4093000	Sure.
4094800	4096100	Yeah, I don't know.
4096200	4100400	I mean if there was a legitimate threat of Civil War, you
4100400	4102300	know, how far does that go?
4102300	4106700	Is there let's be real like if it was going to and I could
4106700	4109000	if I could scribe the future and I knew that would lead to
4109000	4112800	millions of deaths in a brutal bloody war then maybe I might
4112800	4113500	be like, okay.
4113500	4114600	Well morals be damned.
4115200	4117200	I don't want this but I don't know right.
4117200	4118600	I don't know the future like that.
4118600	4122400	I can only make decisions based on what I think is best and
4122400	4125600	what I think would be happened or think would be happened.
4125600	4129500	That's silly what I think would happen in the situation but
4129500	4132800	being scared the worst-case scenario.
4133400	4136900	I just I don't see a realistic possibility that this is going
4136900	4137500	to be a thing.
4138000	4140100	Thank you for calling in in pursuit of knowledge anything
4140100	4141000	else before I let you go.
4141600	4143700	No, that's all catch you later.
4145700	4147200	Yeah, like the the fear-mongering.
4147200	4149400	Well, if we do this is going to destroy the country.
4149400	4151600	Like if this is the rules these are the rules.
4151900	4152800	I'm a rule follower.
4152800	4153700	Does that make me sorry?
4153700	4154200	I don't know.
4158300	4158900	You okay?
4161200	4161900	Yes.
4162300	4163000	No, basically.
4165100	4168400	I had no idea what hold on.
4170900	4171200	Okay.
4171200	4171900	No, sorry about that.
4171900	4172100	Sorry.
4172100	4175500	Look I you have my full attention just as soon as he left.
4175500	4178500	I had a DM from somebody that I had to answer really quick.
4179000	4182800	I was actually asking I was asking Pisco in fact about what
4182800	4187100	he thought of what Artemis presented and he just call in.
4187100	4188500	He just Dino Pisco.
4188500	4190000	Yeah, he's been on my show before too.
4190700	4193200	Oh, yeah, tell him to call in tell him to jump backstage.
4193200	4193900	He's in the server.
4194300	4196200	Like all the people we've talked about today pretty much
4196200	4198100	are in the server watches in the server destination.
4198100	4200000	So all of them, you know, they're all allowed to call in
4201000	4203500	but while while you do that, I'll bring in the next caller
4203500	4204500	and we'll see what they have to say.
4207400	4208100	Hello your life.
4212500	4213500	Hey, can you hear me?
4214500	4214900	Yes.
4214900	4215300	Hello.
4216300	4221400	Hey, so I I just wanted to call in because I have some pretty
4221400	4225600	detailed knowledge about the tunnel.
4225600	4229400	I don't like calling it the new top like gives me a little
4229400	4235600	bit of the of the ick but I'm like of the wick you mean look
4235600	4236600	that's what it is.
4236600	4238100	It's a Jewish tunnel.
4238100	4239400	They made the tunnel.
4239400	4241000	I don't know what does he want to call it?
4241000	4242800	How about that Hebrew tunnels?
4243800	4246700	Hebrew the Hebrew that's not alliterative.
4246900	4249000	I guess you tunnel is in a little bit illiterate.
4249000	4250700	Yeah, it's lazy lazy.
4250700	4251500	We can do better.
4252000	4252700	We'll think of it.
4252700	4253200	We'll think of it.
4253200	4255900	Okay, the tunnels under New York City that were built by
4255900	4257000	Jews go ahead.
4257100	4261100	So I live very nearby to there like a couple of blocks away.
4262100	4267500	I am not a member of I'm not a Chabad Lubavitcher, but I know
4267500	4272400	a lot about them and this it's so interesting to me that this
4272400	4275500	community is now getting all this attention because of this
4275800	4276800	thing going viral.
4278800	4282500	But essentially the tunnel is actually the result of a
4282500	4286700	religious schism within the Chabad Lubavitcher community.
4289400	4292700	It's it how much of the lore about this?
4292700	4298000	Do you want to know give us give us the you have about 10
4298000	4299500	minutes on the call version.
4300600	4302000	All right, that's plenty of time.
4302000	4305600	So essentially I don't want all 10 minutes to be you explaining
4305600	4307200	this by the way, but go ahead.
4307200	4309100	Okay, super valid super valid.
4310900	4313400	There's a bunch of different Orthodox Jewish communities in
4313400	4317900	New York City that all come from different religious dynasties.
4317900	4321100	They call them that they came over from Eastern Europe.
4321300	4323500	So there's the sat Mars in Williamsburg.
4323500	4326000	There's the Lubavitcher in Crown Heights.
4326700	4329200	I don't remember what the people in Borough Park are called
4329700	4331400	you can tell the difference between them by the way, they
4331400	4332300	dress and stuff.
4332500	4336800	Anyway, the Chabad Lubavitcher's had this rabbi.
4337600	4340500	If you walk around New York City these days, you'll see stickers
4340500	4342700	all over the place that have his picture on them.
4342900	4346600	Let's say the Messiah is coming or the Messiah is here and
4346600	4348800	the difference between those two stickers is part of the
4348800	4352600	religious schism where there's essentially three different
4352600	4353500	groups of people.
4354100	4357900	There's the rabbi died the Reb died in 1994.
4358400	4362000	Um, some people think he's just dead and that's it.
4362700	4366300	Some people think he was the Messiah and he did die, but
4366300	4367900	he's going to come back to life.
4368100	4371300	Those are the people that say that he's coming and then there
4371300	4374000	are other people that think he's here and those people think
4374000	4376500	he actually didn't die at all because he was the Messiah.
4377600	4383300	And okay, first of all, the rabbi hole is amazing.
4383300	4385100	We may call it the rabbi hole from now on.
4385700	4388300	But um, I like that rabbi hole.
4388400	4389700	Yeah, that's amazing.
4390800	4393200	But uh, how does that connect?
4393200	4394100	Yeah, what?
4394200	4395900	Okay, you got groups.
4396000	4399100	They think this dude's a messiah or was the Messiah maybe
4399100	4400900	dead tunnels?
4401000	4402000	How does this connect?
4402500	4408100	So the tunnel that is the subject of all this, you know mess
4408300	4414200	was dug underneath 770 Eastern Parkway, which amongst people
4414200	4417600	in that community is a very famous building because it's
4417600	4422700	the synagogue that the Lubavitcher rabbi used during his
4422700	4427900	lifetime and after he died because of this split amongst
4427900	4428600	the community.
4429300	4433100	They weren't able to ever elect a successor and the actual
4433100	4437700	building is split in half and the people on top of the building
4438700	4442400	are part of the group of people that I think think he's dead.
4442800	4446900	The people on the bottom think he's coming back to life and
4446900	4450400	the people who dug the tunnel were the people who think that
4450400	4451600	he's still alive.
4452600	4456300	And they dug the tunnel because he allegedly gave some kind
4456300	4460200	of commandment that the synagogue needs to be expanded and
4460200	4464200	they were trying to dig a tunnel from a sort of unused like
4464200	4465600	former bathhouse.
4465600	4468900	I think either from another building or to another building.
4469000	4470100	I don't know exactly.
4470100	4471500	I think it was from another building.
4471800	4475400	So they could connect them so they could fulfill the Rebs
4475400	4479100	commandment of expanding and thereby do a mitzvah, which is
4479100	4481500	like the whole if you ever walk around New York will also
4481500	4484100	see they'll ask you if you're a Jew all the time all over
4484100	4488500	the place the same people because they're always trying to
4488500	4491900	do mitzvahs because that either makes the Messiah approve
4491900	4495300	of you or makes him come back sooner depending on your
4495300	4499300	interpretation is asking if you're a Jew or not a mitzvah
4499300	4500800	is just doing a good thing.
4502000	4504800	And it could be any number of different things and asking
4504800	4508200	someone if they're Jewish is a good thing because if they
4508200	4511700	say yes, then you have them do a prayer with you and having
4511700	4514900	a lapsed you do a prayer is one of the biggest mitzvahs
4514900	4517300	there is because the whole point is to get all the lapsed
4517300	4519300	Jews to become religious again.
4519400	4521200	And that's when the Messiah will return.
4521500	4524200	I know it sounds completely fucking ridiculous and it is
4524200	4528000	to me but like it's like the South Park Mormon episode,
4528000	4530200	you know where it's like this is what these people actually
4530200	4531500	believe. Yeah.
4532300	4533200	What do you think Dev?
4533500	4535200	I don't I don't know if I have.
4536400	4539300	Yeah, I have I have no idea about anything Jewish.
4539300	4542300	I can't I don't I don't have anything to say I can't comment.
4542500	4545000	I don't know what any of this stuff did.
4545400	4547100	It's interesting enough.
4547100	4548700	Thanks for calling in about it.
4550200	4552600	Well glad you glad you thought it was interesting.
4552600	4557300	I did I I just look there's got to be better memes out there
4557300	4559400	about it though because the truth isn't as important as
4559400	4562500	the funny memes, but thank you for calling in friend and
4562600	4563500	we'll talk to you later.
4564600	4566400	Take okay.
4568100	4570000	Yeah, that was a lot.
4572800	4574100	He could have just made that all up.
4574100	4575100	See this is a problem.
4575200	4578500	Like he could have just legit made every single sentence
4578500	4581000	of what he said of his explanation up.
4581100	4584000	I wouldn't know I've been like, oh really this one.
4586600	4589300	That's a I'll have to look into that.
4589900	4591600	But it's wild if true.
4593700	4598100	We'll have to see let's bring in the next we're getting through
4598100	4600300	them where I want to get as many people as we can.
4600300	4604000	We have a long line and we'll get to as many people as we
4604000	4606100	can. Let's bring in the next guest and I do want peace go
4606100	4606600	to call in.
4606600	4612000	So then we could pit Artemis foul against peace go that
4612000	4612500	would be fun.
4612800	4613900	But hello your life.
4614600	4615600	That'd be funny actually.
4616000	4616400	Yes.
4617200	4617900	Can you hear me?
4619400	4619800	Hello?
4619800	4620600	Yep coming through.
4623000	4625600	Can I ask to have a question about the Antonio Gramsci
4625600	4627000	video? Sure.
4631000	4634000	When you talked about the cultural Marxism Wikipedia page
4634000	4637500	you talked about like this woman Joan Braun and then later
4637500	4639800	on on stitch and Adam you talked about how a lot of it was
4639800	4641300	completely rewritten by her.
4641500	4644300	It's not like the entire story about that because that can't
4644300	4645100	be the case.
4646200	4646700	What do you mean?
4650400	4653800	Said that a lot of the cultural Marxism Wikipedia came
4653800	4655000	rewritten to her.
4656400	4658300	Yes, thank you.
4658300	4664000	I remember you saying is that is that is that just the entire
4664000	4664600	story with that?
4666200	4669000	Well, I mean I didn't put this in the video cuz I didn't
4669000	4672800	know it at the time but it turned out that a lot of the
4672800	4677300	edits to the cultural Marxism Wikipedia page are from her
4677300	4681300	internet username from back in the day and she just cited
4681300	4685000	her own paper and because it's like like no one connected
4685000	4685700	the dots on that.
4685700	4687300	It just stayed and that's what it is now.
4690100	4692300	Yes, I just wanted to double check that cuz I just don't
4692300	4693200	feel ridiculous.
4693200	4693900	Thank you.
4693900	4694400	Thank you.
4694400	4695000	Thanks Dave.
4695600	4697000	Yep, that's that's what it is man.
4697000	4700600	I mean at some point I might have to do a video on Joan
4700600	4703700	Braun but like there's she's like a dime a dozen academic
4703800	4708200	Of someone who's just like leftist and corrupt and in academia
4708300	4710900	and writing completely nonsense fucking papers that are being
4710900	4713800	cited with some sort of moral and factual authority because
4713800	4714900	it comes from University.
4714900	4718400	Well, it's kind of like and I do want to talk about this
4718400	4718600	right?
4718600	4722200	It's like the woozle effect and I'm not sure if you've heard
4722200	4722500	of that.
4722500	4723600	Are you familiar with the term?
4724200	4724600	Nope.
4724900	4729700	So what it is is say you publish a paper.
4729700	4731500	You're an academic and you publish a paper.
4731600	4733600	Okay, then you get your friend.
4733800	4734900	To cite your paper.
4735100	4740600	Okay, and talk about whatever it is the subject racism or
4741000	4743900	now you have two papers, right two papers and then you'll
4743900	4747700	get a third person to cite that paper and then you will cite
4747700	4751700	the third paper and it becomes like a circle right this this
4751700	4752700	this woozle effect.
4752700	4755700	It's from a Winnie the Pooh story where Piglet and Pooh
4755700	4758800	were following their own tracks looking for the woozle, but
4758800	4761000	it turns out that they were just following their own tracks
4761000	4761700	in the snow.
4762400	4765000	And that's what happens a lot with the the citing of the
4765000	4768700	sources and things like that is especially in academia is
4768700	4772600	they'll all cite each other in this like incestuous circle
4772600	4777100	jerk of research quote-unquote.
4777800	4780800	And so you got to be careful from that and Wikipedia unfortunately
4780800	4785600	falls prey to that sometimes because their standards for
4785600	4790400	what gets cited as information is it has to be in a book.
4790700	4792500	It doesn't have to be cracked.
4792500	4797400	It just has to be published and so Wikipedia is a good
4797400	4800900	place to start looking for things but you should start
4800900	4803400	going like you should like read Wikipedia for at least
4803400	4807400	the mainstream view which to be honest is generally mostly
4807400	4810100	correct with some obvious examples, but generally mostly
4810100	4812600	correct but then after you've learned the mainstream view
4813000	4816400	you should start reading the sources in the Wikipedia
4816400	4819200	article right read the sources directly and then they will
4819200	4821500	have sources and you should start like you should at some
4821500	4823500	point start chasing them back, right?
4824800	4827300	Thank you, by the way for calling in a record.
4827400	4828800	Was that literally all you had?
4831200	4832700	Yeah, that's literally all I had.
4836700	4838000	It sounded kind of unbelievable.
4838000	4839100	Yeah, that's what it is though.
4841500	4842800	Speaking of academics.
4842800	4845700	I have a PhD that's once Colin Eucharist.
4845700	4846300	He's a great guy.
4846300	4848900	He's worked in academia and I want to he says he has
4848900	4851200	a story about this that he wants to tell us so we're going
4851200	4853000	to grab him to call in and tell the story.
4853700	4854100	Sure.
4855100	4856200	Lusmark you're alive.
4857000	4857900	Are you the PhD?
4860500	4862000	Can't even hear how to unmute.
4862800	4863200	Hello.
4863200	4864200	No, I'm sorry.
4865100	4866700	My voice is mostly shot.
4866700	4867800	So you're gonna have to bear with me.
4867800	4871700	Okay, but the phenomenon that you were just describing
4872200	4874300	I have a particularly funny story about this.
4874500	4877600	So this is a relatively legendary thing from where I went
4877600	4878300	to undergrad.
4878600	4882700	There was a student in West of class who had just learned
4883000	4886000	about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was reading
4886000	4888900	the Wikipedia article and had learned and this is this is
4888900	4890900	probably well over 10 years back at this point.
4890900	4894100	So Wikipedia moderation standards have improved dramatically
4894100	4895200	in the past five to ten years.
4895700	4897900	But one way that you used to be able to sneak some really
4897900	4901900	fun things into a Wikipedia article was by putting a minor
4901900	4904900	detail in a sentence that was already footnoted that would
4904900	4907800	sort of like escape notice for some time and then sort of
4907800	4911300	just get cemented and so he was reading through the narrative
4911300	4914800	of Gavrilo Princip pulling out his pistol and shooting the
4914800	4918600	Archduke and he added a fun little anecdote in that where
4918600	4922000	he said he pulled out his pistol pistol whipped a nearby
4922000	4926500	pedestrian and then shot the Archduke and just left it there.
4926900	4931700	Now if you go Google Gavrilo Princip pistol whip you will
4931700	4934700	find for example, here's a 2014 article from the Australian
4934800	4938100	Broadcasting Company on the anniversary of the beginning
4938200	4941300	of World War One that quotes this anecdote that says he pistol
4941300	4944200	whipped a nearby pedestrian and then shot the Archduke it
4944200	4947800	made it into a high school history textbook made it in newspapers
4948000	4950800	and then eventually got you know retroactively cited back
4950800	4953800	on to Wikipedia as like well, look these are reputable sources
4953800	4956600	that are saying that Gavrilo Princip pistol whipped a nearby
4956600	4958700	pedestrian. But if you go back and look at the edit history
4958700	4961400	of the article, there's this one fanatical editor who finally
4961400	4963800	got it removed because he's like I'm telling you guys this
4963800	4966400	wasn't a thing before this original edit all of the sources
4966400	4968900	that say it all come from this you guys are crazy.
4968900	4971200	He's just going nuts for months trying to get this off
4971200	4973000	and finally it's gone, but it happens.
4973000	4973800	It really happens.
4973800	4978600	So I salute you Autis whoever that guy was very very fanatical
4978600	4980300	about editing Wikipedia.
4980700	4984700	You are the glue that holds us together, but that kind of
4984700	4989400	a story isn't exactly uncommon.
4989700	4990400	It's not rare.
4990400	4993000	I should say it's not as rare as you would think and this
4993000	4997200	happens with in in especially in kind of streaming circles
4997200	5003000	a lot too is a rumor will start that will be covered on
5003000	5007700	different streams and then it will become it will it will
5007700	5011800	escape. There's an escape velocity to it where it doesn't
5012100	5015700	need to stand on any foundation because the foundation
5015700	5018000	it stands on is now people talking about it.
5018300	5020600	I don't know but that's good.
5020600	5021400	How are you by the way?
5021400	5021900	How's it going?
5021900	5024500	I'm doing okay other than losing my voice over the past
5024500	5028100	week. Yeah, I came because I had promised you we would talk
5028100	5030100	about the plagiarism stuff on Friday.
5030200	5033000	So I wanted to at least get a little bit of it out here
5033000	5036800	in the short time that I have because man there have been
5036800	5038300	so many things in the past year.
5039000	5041400	I don't want to put these on the same level, right?
5041400	5044200	They're obviously different but like October 7th is one
5044200	5047300	example and the the plagiarism thing is another example
5047500	5050500	of just like news stories that more than anything serve
5050500	5055500	to like show people's inability to just process facts at
5055500	5058100	all where like, you know, so for example like the hospital
5058100	5062400	bombing in Gaza you saw people who it never could possibly
5062400	5065100	have been Hamas or another militant organization that did
5065100	5067100	that or it was an accident, you know, it was always going
5067100	5068300	to be Israel and vice versa.
5068300	5070500	There are people who could never conceive of Israel doing
5070500	5073200	something bad same thing with the plagiarism accusations
5073200	5075600	obviously again, like probably 10 tears down and importance
5075600	5078800	but like there are people who for whom it is inconceivable
5079200	5081600	that this woman could ever have intentionally plagiarized
5081600	5083900	repeatedly throughout her entire academic career despite
5083900	5086700	all evidence and if you think that she did and you think
5086700	5088800	she doesn't deserve her post because of that while you're
5088800	5091100	part of you know, this right-wing conspiracy here to be
5091100	5093400	clear Chris everyone knows what you're talking about.
5093400	5095800	The plagiarism thing was Claudine.
5095800	5098500	I think that's her first name Claudine Claudine gay Claudine
5098500	5100600	gay was the president of Harvard.
5101300	5105000	She recently stepped down after credible accusations of
5105000	5108700	plagiarism hit the news, right and there are
5109000	5115400	and I'm sure still are today people who are defending this
5116800	5120200	through various variety of reasons.
5121000	5125700	One of the reasons that I was called a useful idiot by by
5125700	5131600	our friend smug bug because smug bug thinks that because
5131600	5135500	it was a right-wing organization that pushed this that it
5135500	5139300	must be something we have to resist because the right-wing
5139900	5144400	messenger gave the message is something that no good leftist
5144600	5146300	would ever countenance.
5147200	5150700	I think that's problematic for a few reasons.
5151100	5157700	One of those reasons being that there is this idea that
5158600	5164200	the truth is only the truth if it's told by the right people
5164200	5165400	and I think that's harmful.
5165600	5169100	We even if some even at the worst person, you know tells
5169100	5170200	you something that's true.
5170200	5171200	It's still true.
5171400	5172500	It's still correct.
5172500	5174700	It's still something that actually is factually true.
5174800	5179900	Now you can you can interrogate their motivations, but when
5179900	5183400	it comes to plagiarism, we don't have to interrogate the
5183400	5186300	motivations even if they have the worst intentions if they
5186300	5190500	expose plagiarism plagiarism should be dealt with especially
5190600	5194600	if you're a president of a academic institution, I don't
5194600	5197000	know especially the most prestigious academic institution
5197000	5198000	in the United States, right?
5198000	5202700	Like I mean in her in her New York wasn't New York Times
5202700	5207700	op-ed after she resigned former president yay said that she
5207700	5211100	did receive a lot of like actually explicit racist harassment
5211100	5213300	and I believe her I totally believe that there are people
5213300	5216200	who were absolutely giddy and gleeful that a black woman
5216200	5218000	was falling to this campaign.
5218000	5221900	I totally believe that but it my point in the argument was
5221900	5224300	smug about on Twitter and and and that I'll stand by is
5224300	5228500	that it's a type of accusation that doesn't have ammo unless
5229000	5231500	the evidence is there her academic record is public.
5231500	5233500	You can go look at her articles on Google Scholar.
5233700	5235900	You can Google the paragraphs and they will bring up other
5235900	5238500	things from other books right then she did not cite them
5238500	5239000	appropriately.
5239000	5242200	So it's you know, if there are racists who are happy that
5242200	5244800	she's fired, you know, I don't like making versus happy but
5244800	5248300	sometimes, you know, perfectly reasonable things make bad
5248300	5251500	people happy right like thought stuff.
5253600	5258600	Well initially I was thinking of those two CGP Grey videos
5258600	5263300	about following sources back through the centuries you guys
5263300	5264200	would know I'm talking about.
5264200	5264500	Yeah.
5264500	5264800	Yes.
5265200	5265600	Yeah.
5265600	5268400	Yeah, the Staten Island story about the guy who had barrels
5268400	5271700	on his ship and he unleashed them to to win the race and
5271700	5273400	then there was the story about Tiffany.
5273400	5277100	Where did Tiffany first appear in the in the lexicon as
5277100	5281400	a name right and both of those stories involved him like
5281400	5284800	reading books that no one's read for like a hundred years
5285000	5287000	and they've just been sitting on the shelf in the back of
5287000	5290100	a library somewhere and no one like no one knows anything
5290100	5293100	about it and no one cares that such obscure knowledge,
5293100	5293500	right?
5293900	5297100	So I was I was thinking of that because there's a lot of
5297100	5299900	instances where you'll have let's say it's something that's
5299900	5302500	true just completely true right and it's in an old book.
5302600	5303100	All right.
5303100	5306300	And then someone will like 20 years later will cite that
5306300	5309300	off-handedly in their book and then it gets cited again
5309300	5312100	and again and it goes like five or six books down changing
5312100	5314900	a little bit each time just citing the previous book as
5314900	5317800	to where it came from and then it gets then eventually
5317800	5320600	as soon as the the internet hits then it's on Wikipedia
5320600	5323200	and it's probably in some kind of dumbed down form or
5323200	5327000	it's on it's an article somewhere and you know, it's
5327000	5329600	it's half truth at best at that point from all the
5329600	5331700	transformations it's gone through right?
5332000	5333900	So a lot of this sounds like that.
5335000	5337800	Well and and one one thing that makes the type of plagiarism
5337800	5339000	that she was committing.
5339000	5339600	I think so.
5339600	5342800	So the reason academics I think should care about it
5342800	5346900	so much is when you do omit question marks and citations
5347000	5350200	you risk this thing happening even more so you risk just
5350200	5352400	stating a claim that someone takes this fact from your
5352400	5354000	work. They cite it from your work.
5354000	5356400	You haven't cited where you got it from maybe like in
5356400	5357400	one instance with her thing.
5357500	5360600	She took someone else's paragraph wholesale and changed
5360600	5361200	one word.
5361200	5364200	It was about the relationship between you know X initiative
5364200	5366100	and voting turnout among the black population or something
5366100	5368700	like that and the original thing that she copied from
5368700	5370700	said it had a negative correlation and she flipped it
5370700	5373800	to a positive correlation not on the basis of her own statistical
5373800	5377100	analysis, but just changing a word and so she's completely
5377100	5379700	changed the conclusion that someone else arrived at based
5379700	5381500	on their own statistical analysis.
5381600	5383500	But now there's a paper out there that I could cite that
5383500	5386200	makes that claim that bolsters my evidence right and I
5386200	5387400	can't follow her chain back.
5387400	5390000	She's she's cut me off from even doing that work the
5390000	5391900	hard work to go dig up that book that nobody's ever read.
5391900	5394100	You know, like I can't do that anymore when she doesn't
5394100	5396000	put quotes when she doesn't cite what she's supposed to
5396900	5397200	yeah.
5397200	5399100	Yeah, that's what we should be able to do theoretically.
5399100	5403600	Yeah, I think it's just hilarious that the internet has
5403600	5404200	been okay.
5404200	5407100	Let's say the left-wing internet has been doubling down
5407100	5409400	on defending this woman over and over and over because
5409400	5412000	she is left-wing herself and she plagiarized what she's
5412000	5414900	left-wing at the same time like a week earlier.
5415300	5418400	The left-wing internet was in an uproar about plagiarism
5418400	5420800	when it was an H bomber guy put out that video.
5420800	5424400	Yeah, right about YouTubers played plagiarizing and it's
5424400	5428000	like guys like very clearly there's just a partisan angle
5428000	5430400	to this right where it doesn't like the plagiarism itself
5430400	5432300	doesn't actually matter to these people.
5432500	5434700	The only thing that matters is whether their guys are
5434700	5435600	winning or losing.
5435700	5438400	Look this this is what frustrates me because this is
5438400	5440300	the first time this has happened and won't be the last
5440300	5442600	time this has happened where there's like this huge
5442600	5445100	partisan angle to what we think is right or wrong.
5445700	5449200	I I actually believe in a lot of these these values right
5449200	5452200	that leftists claim to hold I actually do believe that
5452200	5456000	there is that racism is bad like anti-semitism is a problem.
5456100	5458300	I do think that plagiarism and stealing other people's
5458300	5463600	work theft of time and theft of labor are both really big
5463600	5464600	issues, right?
5464600	5468000	I think that there's all these things at stake, but you
5468000	5472700	hurt what I want to happen when you make a game of it when
5472700	5476500	you make it this political football game that you're playing
5476500	5478900	just to hurt the other team and make sure your team gets
5478900	5479800	those touchdowns.
5480000	5481400	I don't care about the team.
5481600	5486000	The only reason I'm on this team so to speak right is that
5486000	5490400	it has the values that I I think are correct and when you
5490400	5493100	show that you do not care about those values.
5493700	5496500	That's I don't care if your team wins or not at that point,
5496500	5497000	right?
5497300	5497700	I don't know.
5497700	5498400	That's just my thought.
5498900	5499200	Yeah.
5499200	5504800	Yeah, there's an article in the Harvard Crimson the student
5504800	5507100	paper obviously has been covering this a lot and there was
5507100	5511100	one op-ed by the editorial board that came to her defense.
5511400	5513400	I think one thing that gets lost in the whole discussion
5513400	5517000	is the actual timeline of events where much of the statements
5517000	5520200	that Harvard made and that the defenses of her came before
5520200	5522800	additional accusations had come to light and been sort of
5522800	5523400	adjudicated.
5523500	5525800	So there were early accusations that were raised in October
5525900	5528500	after the controversy with the congressional hearing.
5529000	5531200	So people started digging into her record because she offended
5531200	5534000	people and they found these things that look suspicious those
5534000	5535300	early ones were like, okay.
5535300	5538000	This isn't that bad like she cited this paper elsewhere in
5538000	5539500	the dissertation like she could probably could have done
5539500	5541700	better and then as time went on more and more things were
5541700	5545200	found. So the Harvard Crimson editorial board wrote in favor
5545200	5548800	of her, but then there was a dissenting member of the undergrad
5549600	5552000	Honor Council at Harvard who wrote an essay basically who
5552000	5554700	said I get to weigh in on decisions of whether or not someone
5554700	5558300	gets suspended or expelled at Harvard for exactly this kind
5558300	5560700	of stuff. And this is definitionally plagiarism.
5560700	5564200	I voted to suspend people undergrads at Harvard for violating
5564200	5564900	this policy.
5565000	5568500	How can our president be held to a lower standard than Joe
5568500	5569800	Schmoe jr.
5569800	5572600	Who copied a paragraph off Wikipedia in his senior seminar
5572600	5576300	or whatever, you know, like like how it's a really good op-ed.
5576300	5578500	I think like the student is like I take these decisions
5578500	5581000	seriously and it doesn't seem like Harvard is as a school.
5581000	5581500	So yeah.
5583700	5585700	Bro Dev, what were you going to say?
5586300	5586500	Sorry.
5586500	5587300	Yeah, I cut you off there.
5587300	5592000	So wick you and I had a very short back and forth and it
5592000	5596000	was over Twitter banning like left-wing accounts recently,
5596000	5596300	right?
5596300	5596700	Oh, yeah.
5596800	5599200	Yeah, I was that was my pocket in case things.
5599400	5599800	Yeah.
5601000	5602300	Well, I don't know.
5602400	5605100	I don't know if you were replying to this but I'll just send
5605100	5609700	you my tweet anyway, but it's basically someone said, you
5609700	5613300	know a bunch of left-wing accounts and journalism suspended
5613300	5616500	from from Twitter and then I posted that xkcd.
5616500	5618500	No, I promise you it wasn't a subtweet.
5618500	5620500	I've seen a lot of it on my time.
5620500	5623600	Okay, people celebrating this happening and saying good
5623600	5626100	right like the I'm not necessarily celebrating there is
5626100	5628000	some schadenfreude here for sure, but I'm not necessarily
5628000	5632800	celebrating but there's that legendary xkcd tweet where
5632800	5635600	the person says the right to free speech means the government
5635600	5638600	can't arrest you for what you want for what you say is just
5638600	5640400	that people listening think you're an asshole and they're
5640400	5643600	showing you the door right and whenever let's say, you know
5643600	5647300	over the past decade online a right-winger has been censored
5647300	5650800	and says what about free speech Leftists have always posted
5650800	5652900	this comic and they've been very smug about it.
5652900	5653500	You know what I mean?
5653800	5658000	They said well or even crazier you'll like I've seen this
5658000	5660200	from let's say even more radical accounts where they'll
5660200	5666100	say freeze peach freeze and because they make a mockery
5666100	5670100	of the idea of appealing to free speech and what's underneath
5670100	5673300	that this is something that I tried to Hammer home in my
5673300	5678300	talk on your channel wick with with Karl Max is that you
5678300	5682300	can't simply have a standard where you are not censored
5682300	5684600	and you can have all the debates about your ideas that you
5684600	5687600	like but your opponents are censored and the reason you
5687600	5690900	can't do that even if you think your opponents are evil
5690900	5694400	and that it would be good to censor them is because when
5694400	5697500	they get power and they will they will turn it around on
5697500	5700800	you. And that's what's happening now is that you like
5700800	5705100	yeah, the the cultural zeitgeist is shifting rightward a
5705100	5708800	little bit right Elon now controls Twitter and you're seeing
5708800	5711600	things move in a more rightward direction online and now
5711600	5714100	you're seeing Leftists get censored and so the liberal
5714100	5717400	response to that is hey, we shouldn't be censoring everyone
5717400	5720000	which is true and I agree with you on that right, but
5720000	5724200	if you if you have if you have if you have a paradigm where
5724400	5727900	Every time the left is in power they censor because they
5727900	5730800	don't care about liberal principles hypothetically and
5730800	5734000	every time I get a hypothetically the right is in power.
5734100	5735900	They do care about liberal principles.
5735900	5738700	So they don't censor that means that you that you have
5738700	5741800	basically a ratcheting effect only moving one way right
5742000	5745400	where you have things are pushed leftward and then when
5745400	5747300	things swing back, they don't actually swing back.
5747300	5749600	You just maintain a neutrality of whatever came before
5749800	5754400	So there is a good argument that unless your opponents
5754500	5757700	commit to not being censorious in the future.
5758000	5760900	You must also go against liberal principles and
5760900	5764900	censor them because liberal principles only work if
5764900	5767900	ever it is a trap it is a trap but but you have to
5767900	5770200	figure out that not doing it is also a trap though
5770400	5772600	because then things will they will just inevitably
5772600	5775200	win over enough iterated games, right?
5775200	5777400	So you have to say listen, we're going to punish you
5777600	5780000	by the same standard that you punished us and we're
5780000	5783300	going to do it until you recognize that your standard
5783300	5785500	is wrong and you can't do it to us.
5785500	5787800	That's not why they're punishing them, right?
5787800	5789600	Like that's not why it's happening.
5789700	5793300	They're doing it because it's team sports and so free
5793300	5794600	speech is a big issue of mine.
5794800	5798600	And one of the problems I have is that almost no one
5798600	5800000	actually believes in it, right?
5800300	5802400	A lot of people will say that they believe in it, but
5802400	5804800	they'll do this thing where they're always willing to
5804800	5807300	censor the other side because they're dangerous and
5807400	5811000	they're never willing to in any time the same weapon
5811000	5811900	is turned on them.
5812100	5813700	They decry it, right?
5814000	5817200	And one of the things the great things about organizations
5817200	5818600	like thefire.org.
5818800	5820200	I don't know if you're familiar with them.
5820400	5822900	Is that whether you're left right or center, they will
5822900	5825900	defend your free speech rights legally, right?
5825900	5827100	And that's how it should be.
5827100	5827300	Yeah.
5827500	5828000	Yeah, I agree.
5828800	5832700	But the problem becomes is it's a cultural problem
5833000	5835100	when we do this.
5835100	5836800	Well, it happened to us.
5837000	5839200	So now we're going to do it to you to show you what it
5839200	5840100	feels like.
5840300	5844400	It just perpetuates the cycle and so someone has to be
5844400	5849200	a bigger person and say no, we're not going to continue
5849200	5850000	this cycle.
5850100	5853900	We're going to stop it and we are going to both culturally
5853900	5858700	and legislatively defang the processes and methods on
5858700	5863600	which people engage in this attack on free speech.
5863600	5869100	So they say so I completely agree with you, but I think
5869100	5873300	that process can only happen after you've given the sensors
5873300	5874500	a dose of their own medicine.
5874800	5876300	So I can give you two examples, right?
5876300	5878500	So one I said when we were talking about this week, I sent
5878500	5880300	you that Star Trek The Next Generation clip.
5880600	5882200	Yeah, did you watch it?
5882200	5884300	No, I got to watch it.
5884300	5885300	I'm gonna be real with you.
5885400	5886400	Like I saw it on my Twitter.
5886400	5887200	I'm like, oh, that's cool.
5887200	5888200	I'll watch it later.
5888200	5889700	And then I just ever did.
5889700	5893700	Okay, so the episode is that Picard is kidnapped by aliens
5894000	5897000	and the aliens are actually very benevolent and benign.
5897000	5898500	They were just experimenting, right?
5898500	5902000	They didn't really hurt him, but then he kidnaps them and
5902000	5904400	he holds them and they're like extremely distressed and like,
5904400	5905900	oh, you can't be doing this.
5905900	5908200	We didn't mean you any harm and it's like well now, you know
5908200	5910800	what it feels like you can't do this to me.
5911000	5913100	And now that I've done it to you, you're going to know why
5913100	5914200	you can't do this to me.
5914400	5917200	And that was the lesson he he did it a bit and then he let
5917200	5920300	off and said now, you know, and then they parted ways, right?
5920300	5922700	And there was no eternal punishment of him.
5922700	5926200	There was if I thought if I thought that the people in power
5926200	5928900	right that we're going to punish the Liberals would just
5928900	5932900	do it like a card would then maybe I would agree with you,
5932900	5934300	but they're not going to do that.
5934600	5936500	You and I both know they're not going to do that.
5936500	5937600	Yeah, it's going to take it away.
5937600	5939600	It's escalating my medic cycle.
5939600	5940000	Yeah.
5940300	5940700	Yeah.
5940800	5942300	Yeah, the other option is they escalate and that's also
5942300	5943000	not good, right?
5943100	5946300	So so there's um, the other the other example is Destiny
5946300	5948500	talks about this a lot where Destiny says something like
5949100	5955000	he seems to be kind of fixated on when Obama's final Supreme
5955000	5958700	Court justice was stolen from him because they simply blocked
5958700	5961000	it for a year and a half by not holding that hearing.
5961900	5962600	Remember that work?
5962600	5963100	I do.
5963100	5964100	I remember it.
5964100	5966100	Yeah, I remember it distinctly.
5966100	5968800	There's all there's a lot of arguments there that that this
5968800	5972100	was Harry Reid's fault when he changed the filibuster rules
5972100	5973500	anyway, but carry on.
5973600	5977400	Yeah, yeah, but basically the even if it was legal it was
5977400	5980400	very clearly immoral and against the spirit of how things
5980400	5981300	should function right?
5981300	5984800	Yeah, and so so Destiny's opinion seems to be you know,
5984800	5987700	what we should once we once we have the capability to do
5987700	5991200	so we should do that once to the Republicans just so they
5991200	5994700	have a taste of it and then we can say okay, you know, we've
5994700	5996000	now hit you back now.
5996000	5998700	We both know we can't behave this way but we have but we
5998700	6000500	can't just get them get away with it.
6000500	6003400	We have to do it at least once to them so they know it's
6003400	6004700	the same principle here though.
6004700	6007000	Yeah, but that's never going to be how that works.
6007100	6009900	What that's going to do is people are going to say oh it
6009900	6012800	worked we're going to engage in it to show you a lesson.
6013000	6015100	Oh, wait, it actually worked again.
6015300	6018200	Hell this is going to be a power politics play from now
6018200	6021700	on and now it's normalized in the lexicon of how we behave
6021800	6022500	lexicons wrong.
6022500	6025100	Yeah, but you know, this is now yeah, but going my biggest
6025500	6028500	yeah, this is my biggest disagreement with Josiah pondering
6028500	6030500	politics first, but whenever I get my voice back, we're
6030500	6032700	supposed to talk about this book actually tyranny their
6032700	6036600	minority same authors who did how democracies die a few
6036600	6040100	years back and one of their arguments in both books.
6040100	6044400	Is that you do actually see like a deterioration of like
6044500	6047800	cross aisle and Democratic norms in the US particularly
6047800	6051000	around the Clinton impeachment and like since then things
6051000	6053700	have like become in an escalating cycle more and more hostile.
6054100	6057900	And so for example, like we didn't used to have real controversy
6057900	6060600	about Supreme Court appointments, but since Clinton we have
6060600	6061300	on both sides.
6061700	6064200	And so I'm yeah, I'm not convinced that there's ever going
6064200	6067100	to be a point where one side says well you did this and
6067100	6070300	now we get to clap back and that's going to be it like you
6070300	6072900	understand now how bad it's going to be I see it like yet
6073000	6075600	more like the ratcheting or more like I love Renee Gerard
6075600	6078400	and he talks about escalating cycles of imitative violence
6078400	6080500	and I think that's just sort of what's happening.
6080500	6083500	I don't know how it ends until one side decides to be principled
6083600	6086000	and and not do that but then that requires you know, a lot
6086000	6086900	of sacrifice as well.
6087900	6091500	So, yeah, I just I don't see where that definitive point
6091500	6094800	is where like I love Star Trek and I love that example.
6094800	6095400	I think it's great.
6095400	6097400	I think that's how it would work in an ideal world like
6097400	6100900	a lot of things in Star Trek, but unfortunately we're stupid
6100900	6103300	and not rational and that's not how people actually work,
6103300	6103700	right?
6104300	6107000	So here's the thing right because the options only seem
6107000	6112300	to be you you give your opponents as much unfairness as
6112300	6116100	they give use to teach them and then you stop or you both
6116100	6120300	escalate or you do nothing and allow them to escalate
6120600	6123900	unopposed and then like then you just lose right now.
6123900	6125500	There seems to be no other option.
6125600	6126200	No, Dev.
6126300	6128400	I disagree that you lose in that case.
6128600	6131900	What you do is you draw a delineation distinction in the
6131900	6134400	voters minds between it's been okay.
6134400	6136700	I'm talking about liberal democracies here, which we live
6136700	6139900	in. Okay, I'm not going to I'm not going to posit on whether
6139900	6144100	this works in a another system, but in our system what
6144100	6147300	you do is you say okay these this is why we're different.
6147300	6151600	We have principles they do not and generally this gives
6151600	6152800	you elections, right?
6152800	6156100	This is why you win elections generally and that's going
6156100	6157200	to happen all the time.
6157300	6159300	It's not going to be a clear and present thing.
6159500	6162600	But when you stoop to their level what you do is you make
6162600	6165800	it a situation where people cannot tell the difference between
6165800	6169000	you and them and then why would they vote for you over them?
6169000	6172000	Because I mean then it's just they can't they can't tell
6172000	6176700	you're both engaging in the same kind of chicanery and so
6177200	6181400	see that this this this makes sense up until the point that
6181400	6184300	the other side is actually able to fuck with how elections
6184300	6187000	are run and then this breaks down because then it doesn't
6187000	6188000	matter who votes for you.
6189800	6193100	As long as we're referencing apt sci-fi things, you know,
6193100	6197500	this my position I think is like the the war games position
6197500	6200500	right you the only winning move is not to play right like
6200600	6203800	that. You can't once you get in the cycle like everybody
6203800	6206300	dies or you know, somebody taps out.
6206300	6209900	Those are the only two options and in my estimation unless
6209900	6214000	unless we actually have strong enough institutional bullworks
6214000	6216700	that punish people when they start stepping out of the real
6216700	6220200	bounds, but I'm I used to be very optimistic about that.
6220200	6221100	I don't know if I am anywhere.
6222100	6224700	Honestly, I think America does I mean I've been following
6224700	6226000	the various Trump indictments.
6226000	6229500	I think he's totally fucked at least on the documents case.
6229800	6232100	The other ones are hitting this but like we'll see but if
6232100	6235800	you see that the most recent Michigan poll like he's up eight
6235800	6237800	points in Michigan right now, Michigan.
6238000	6238700	It's insane.
6238800	6242200	Like I if I was Biden I would be quaking right now if that's
6242200	6244200	if it's a good poll and all that blah blah blah, you know
6244200	6245000	political science stuff.
6245000	6247200	That's I did I did fake political science.
6247200	6249200	I do political theory, but my friends who do real political
6249200	6252500	science. Tell me all of these things so but that's should
6252500	6254900	be scary if you don't want Trump to win and I don't want
6254900	6258700	Trump to win even though I'm a conservative so like I don't
6258700	6261300	know what a second Trump presidency looks like.
6261300	6263900	I think it looks like gutting all those bulwarks.
6263900	6267300	I'm confident in if yeah, you all of these cases could stick
6267300	6269100	if they give him house arrest and he's still on the ballot
6269100	6270800	and he gets re-elected what happens?
6272300	6272800	I don't know.
6273400	6278600	Yeah, I mean I do like the the idea of Trump goes to jail,
6278600	6281400	but he's also the president and then you have like his Secret
6281400	6283600	Service in the jail with him because that could be that
6283600	6287800	could be like a hilarious movie, but it's yeah, it's it would
6287800	6288900	make a fun movie.
6288900	6289500	You're correct.
6289500	6294400	But a reality would be no, I don't want to know that Trump
6294400	6296300	Trump ruling the country from jail.
6296300	6297000	Oh my God.
6297200	6297400	Listen.
6297400	6299400	I'm glad I'm not an American you guys have fun with that
6299400	6299800	shit.
6301600	6302400	You Chris.
6303100	6304700	Thank you for calling in.
6304700	6306400	I'm sorry that you're not feeling well.
6306400	6307400	Well, that's great.
6307600	6308100	I'm sorry.
6308700	6311800	I just your chat has this neon Reagan guy who put conservative
6311800	6314200	and scare quotes fight me you Chris on Discord message me
6314200	6314600	anytime.
6314600	6317900	Let's ha ha ha neon Reagan's from my community.
6317900	6320400	He is like a he's a paleoconservative.
6320500	6325200	Oh, well, then we have more overlapping things, but he is
6325200	6326800	a pro Trump paleoconservative.
6326800	6327900	Oh, well, then that's stupid.
6328800	6329600	Okay, that's fine.
6331200	6331600	Okay.
6331800	6334100	Thank you for calling in you guys.
6335600	6339300	I like you Chris you Chris is one of the original Wickers
6339900	6345700	who would go and talk with me when I was like had two people
6345700	6347100	watching me, right?
6347400	6349000	So really good guy.
6349300	6351900	He's fun to argue with I have some substantive disagree with
6351900	6355800	some of them on a few things, but I think that overall whip
6355800	6360500	smart honest honest guy genuine and he's a PhD so I get to
6360500	6361600	throw that around a little bit.
6361600	6363500	So yeah, yeah.
6363800	6364900	I mean, oh man.
6365900	6370000	When it comes to the the whole academic thing the go-to food
6370000	6373700	shops in the chat, she knows what I'm talking about the go-to
6374100	6379900	is when for me just to show some of the the obvious bias is
6379900	6384200	when academic agent got fired right back in like 2019.
6384200	6384700	Do you remember that?
6384700	6387800	Do you remember the story there wasn't this President Sunday
6387800	6388300	related?
6388800	6392900	Yes, it was vaguely remember it remind me.
6393500	6396100	Yeah, so academic agent.
6396100	6400400	He ran like an anti SJW YouTube channel the back in that era
6400400	6403400	of YouTube and he was definitely like a center-right type
6403400	6403800	of guy.
6405700	6408000	But President Sunday back in the day.
6408100	6410900	This is in years and years and years ago got together a crowd
6410900	6414000	of people to send a bunch of messages to his University
6414000	6416700	because he was a professor at a University in the UK.
6417100	6421100	So they spam the University with various reports and they
6421100	6422700	said this in this guy.
6422900	6424400	He's a threat to your students.
6424400	6427300	He's far right and because the UK is way more sensitive
6427300	6430800	to the sort of stuff in America is he lost his job and
6430800	6433200	he can't he still has some connections in publishing.
6433200	6435400	So he's been publishing new books, but he doesn't teach
6435400	6435800	anymore.
6435900	6438800	Like he was he was kicked out of academia despite having
6438800	6439500	his PhD.
6439800	6442100	It's like that sounds ridiculous in my opinion, even though
6442100	6445100	I just I don't agree with him and I mean since being isolated
6445100	6448000	academic agent has radicalized very far right, but I don't
6448000	6450000	necessarily blame him for that because no one came to his
6450000	6451300	offense except for the right wingers.
6451600	6453000	Yeah, that that's how that works.
6453100	6456000	This is a tale as old as time right you kick them out.
6456000	6461500	So there's no one no one sane will associate with them and
6461500	6463500	well, who are they going to who they're going to turn to
6463500	6466500	because they're not going to cease to exist, right?
6466500	6469300	They're just go with the people who will listen and talk
6469300	6472100	to them and they ain't going to get pushback on their crazy
6472100	6473000	ideas anymore.
6473100	6476700	But no, I think that it's just scummy all around that whole
6476700	6477100	story.
6477100	6480700	So so so the academic agent story is where I first started
6480700	6484700	really paying attention to not just, you know, personal
6484700	6487000	left-wing bias, which I experienced a lot when I was in
6487000	6490500	University myself, but also institutional left-wing bias
6490700	6493800	where the rules actually are just applied one way.
6494100	6498700	And so for me once I saw the the Harvard plagiarism story
6498800	6502000	that was just like another data point in a very long list
6502000	6502600	of data points.
6502600	6505500	I've been collecting for like five years now of just how
6505600	6508000	how left-leaning academia is.
6508200	6512200	And and there's probably some there's probably some natural
6512200	6515700	inclination for academia to be left-leaning because the
6515700	6518000	right does tend to be more intellectual focused and the
6518000	6519800	left is like more blue-collar focus.
6520000	6523500	So there's probably some natural probably some of the
6523500	6527200	left-leaning ness of it is just how it how it is naturally,
6527400	6530400	but I think a lot of it is definitely like artificially
6530400	6533500	imposed and they're rigorously gatekeeping other ideas.
6534000	6534900	Yeah institutional capture.
6534900	6536600	Yeah, it's this idea.
6536700	6539300	Well, yeah, I'm on man's I won't explain it to you, right?
6539300	6544500	You know what I'm talking about, but I I think it's getting
6544500	6548800	better. I think that this is evidence of it getting better
6548800	6552400	because it this had happened in 2020.
6553300	6554800	We wouldn't have had the same outcome.
6554800	6559200	I think that funnily enough October 7th and the response
6559200	6563700	to it by a lot on the far left really just there is a
6563700	6567100	there's a there's going to be a divorce between certain
6567100	6572000	segments left the people who cheered and the people who
6572400	6574900	who didn't on October 7th, right?
6574900	6579000	I think that we're going to have a far-reaching.
6580400	6581200	Yeah differences.
6581200	6585600	So what was what's really funny is like when I went through
6585600	6589000	my leaving the left moment, it was 10 years ago, right?
6589300	6593400	And October 7th was something that I knew was coming for
6593400	6596100	a long time now like not that specific event.
6596400	6601900	But this idea this idea that liberals would eventually
6601900	6605200	see the liberals who didn't get like slowly pushed into
6605200	6606200	the socialist camp.
6606300	6609400	The liberals would eventually see exactly who they buddied
6609400	6613200	up with during the 2016 to 2020 era because there was a
6613200	6616700	lot of just broad leftist unity in the face of you know,
6616900	6620800	Trump getting elected and Bolsonaro and Brexit and there
6620800	6623600	seem to be the slow rise of the right-wing in liberal
6623600	6625800	democracies, which is still continuing in Europe.
6625800	6627500	There's no right-wing or right-wing parties are still
6627500	6628100	getting elected.
6628100	6631500	I saw that happen in Argentina as well video recently.
6631500	6633200	Did you see that one where they're all doing the Nazi
6633200	6634000	salute or whatever?
6634600	6635300	Which one was that?
6635600	6636600	It was very recent.
6636600	6640100	I think it was Italy could be could be Spain, but maybe
6641200	6645100	like a huge crowd of people all just doing the Nazi salute,
6645100	6650100	but yeah, so there has been this slow rise of the right
6650400	6651000	for sure.
6651200	6654700	And I think in least in the English-speaking world the
6654700	6658800	broader left United in the face of that but then after
6659000	6661300	you know, Trump Trump lost in 2020.
6661600	6664500	They kind of had to figure out why they were together and
6664500	6668200	I think October 7th was I knew something like this would
6668200	6671000	happen where liberals realized why hey you actually don't
6671000	6672500	fit with leftist all that much.
6672900	6674100	I didn't know what it was going to be but it was going
6674100	6675200	to be some big event.
6675200	6676700	It turned out to be October 7th, right?
6676800	6680400	So I see I see Brianna Wu, for example tweeting stuff that
6680400	6682200	I was saying 10 years ago and it's like you're going through
6682200	6683000	the exact same thing.
6683000	6684000	I went through 10 years ago.
6684200	6686700	The reason I went through through it 10 years ago is because
6686700	6688600	for me it wasn't a public event for me.
6688600	6691400	It was being in University and reading a lot of their political
6691400	6696600	theory and figuring out where it goes, you know, we all get
6696600	6697500	there in different ways.
6699900	6702700	I like to hear a lot of different perspectives for me.
6702700	6704500	It's not so much a left versus right thing.
6704700	6707900	It's extremist versus non extremist thing.
6708100	6711000	Like I can get I can get along with a right-wing moderate
6711000	6714000	right or someone who's a moderate and has very conservative
6714000	6717700	views. I would get along with that person but extremists
6717700	6722200	on either side even even an extremist who takes all my values
6722200	6725100	everything I want but they're extreme about it and they're
6725100	6726800	extreme about the ways they go about it.
6726900	6727900	It's something I don't want.
6728000	6729200	I don't want to associate with.
6729400	6730800	Well associates the wrong word.
6730800	6733700	I don't want to be on their team because I think that the
6733700	6739400	extreme nature of how you engage with the world affects like
6739400	6744100	it takes everything you touch it twists and contorts things
6744100	6747800	that I would consider values to be weapons in a lot of ways
6747800	6748900	and I don't like it.
6748900	6753900	So speaking of a speaking of extremism food shops after
6753900	6756200	announced to you guys food shops is in fact coming becoming
6756200	6757300	a right-wing extremist.
6757700	6758900	She's going through it right now.
6759900	6763000	I want to she's been reading Mencius mold bug.
6763100	6764900	She's been reading Mencius mold bug and she's becoming a
6764900	6765700	right-wing extremist guys.
6765700	6766300	You have to understand.
6766300	6768700	I don't I don't want to talk about food shops too much because
6768700	6770300	she can't defend herself on my channel.
6770300	6772500	She got banned because of the peto stuff.
6772900	6774100	But uh, wait from your server.
6774100	6774600	She's banned.
6774600	6775300	She can't come in.
6775300	6775900	She's banned.
6775900	6777900	Um, I don't know what you mean about it.
6778300	6780000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6780000	6782300	Was this your ruling or your mods or what?
6782300	6786100	My mods, my mods and my admins made this decision.
6786200	6791000	I haven't looked into the the I have seen I've heard some
6791000	6791500	of the clips.
6791500	6792700	They don't look good.
6793600	6796600	I have been meaning to get around to talking to her directly
6796600	6797200	about it.
6797300	6799400	Unfortunately holidays Etc.
6799700	6802400	I haven't yeah until I figure it out.
6803100	6806500	I'm gonna hold this for I looked into it.
6806500	6811200	Yeah, and I mean the I looked into it and she just seems to
6811200	6813900	be like schizo, which is fine.
6813900	6814400	It's fun.
6815200	6816200	But like like here's the thing.
6816300	6818300	I don't think everyone's like she's a pedophile.
6818300	6820000	I don't think she's a real pedophile guys.
6820300	6825100	I just think she has zero tacked zero ability to form a coherent
6825100	6825700	sentence.
6826000	6829800	No idea what when to not say the edgy joke and it's like,
6829800	6834000	okay, I did the clips I've seen and their clips to be fair
6834200	6835500	didn't sound like a joke.
6835600	6837000	It sounded like her argument.
6837300	6841100	Um, well also also here's the thing like like for me.
6841100	6843000	Here we can move away from food drops.
6843700	6844300	Thanks, Deb.
6844300	6845500	She says in the chat.
6846000	6848100	Okay, here we can move away from food drops.
6849000	6853100	Like I personally don't care that much about the drawn
6853100	6855000	lolly stuff because it's a drawing.
6855000	6857000	It's like I whatever I don't care, you know, if you don't
6857000	6858700	like if you like it, I don't care if you don't like it.
6858700	6859200	I don't care.
6859400	6861000	There are people who there are people who came over this
6861000	6863800	with the people who want to treat drawings as if they're
6863800	6866500	the exact same morally as real child porn.
6866500	6867500	I think that's ridiculous.
6867700	6872300	No, but it's like something can be worse.
6872500	6875400	But the original thing is still not good and not something
6875400	6876400	I want right?
6878200	6879500	Yeah, I don't I don't know.
6879500	6880300	I'd have to again.
6880300	6881800	I have to talk to her at some point.
6882300	6884400	Let's have the lolly debate with let's do it.
6884400	6886400	We might have the lolly debate.
6886400	6887200	We can do it right now.
6887200	6889400	We can we can monetize the shit out of it.
6889400	6890400	Why do it right now?
6890400	6892700	Well, we can make a production value of it.
6892700	6896900	Dev as the defense attorney for food stamps, right comes
6896900	6900000	on my show, right and then we'll have a prosecutor right
6900000	6901800	going and we'll and I'll be the judge.
6901800	6906100	I'll wear a wig will make some money and like if you if
6906100	6909500	you super chat will get that'll be like the jury, right?
6909500	6911400	Well, it's super chat to do the journey.
6911400	6911700	Nice.
6911700	6912700	Yeah, it'll be great.
6912800	6914000	But let's bring another color.
6914000	6916300	We've we've convinced that I want to get as many people as
6916300	6916900	we possible.
6917000	6919200	I know I said one to two hours, but we got a lot of people
6919200	6921800	so I don't know if you have anywhere to be or no, I'm good.
6921800	6922100	Let's go.
6922200	6925100	Okay, I can probably do do like one more hour.
6925600	6926600	One more hour ish.
6926600	6926900	Okay.
6926900	6927900	Well probably goes.
6927900	6928300	Okay.
6928400	6929200	We'll see how it goes.
6929900	6932800	But and you thought that this wasn't going to be interesting.
6932800	6933900	We have nothing to talk about.
6933900	6935500	You're foolish.
6936000	6938200	Let's bring in the next contestant on whatever the fuck
6938200	6938700	this is.
6938900	6940400	I still hope Brianna Wu shows up at the end.
6940400	6942000	Maybe again.
6942000	6945200	I'll send her another DM my alibi.
6945200	6945900	Hello your life.
6945900	6954500	Oh, how about now?
6955200	6956000	How's good now?
6956000	6958000	It's good greetings.
6958200	6958600	Yo.
6959000	6962900	Well, that's a lot to follow up of that was a good conversation
6962900	6965900	and all that but I'll do my best.
6969300	6970200	Well, yeah for us.
6971200	6977900	Well, so one I was backing off a topic earlier because I had
6977900	6981300	some interaction with it but like political labels where
6981400	6985300	liberal versus conservative people on the far left don't
6985300	6987400	like to call other liberals.
6987400	6990900	They'll just call them conservative neoliberal use
6990900	6996100	pejoratives and stuff and how again we can't even come down
6996200	7000300	to like simple facts on how to kind of label people or where
7000300	7001000	they fit in.
7004000	7008000	And like on the liberal side you have people who are pro Israel
7008600	7012600	and also pro Palestine, but then someone who might be pro
7012600	7017800	Israel a lot of extreme leftists won't like to call them
7018600	7019400	liberal at all.
7020800	7024400	Yeah, so let's go ahead.
7024400	7027400	No, I agree with your point here.
7027400	7029300	Yeah, they go on continue.
7032600	7038100	So like where do you know it because also the PhD guy who
7038100	7041500	was on earlier and I enjoyed that talking about kind of the
7041500	7047000	processing of facts how stuff can be edited.
7047600	7051500	How do you get people to come to kind of a common agreement
7052000	7056600	of what they call liberal or conservative and like just
7056600	7061800	because you don't agree with one liberal position doesn't
7061800	7064500	mean you're conservative and again, you're just bad faith
7064500	7068700	if you're so I think this is a this is a problem about people
7068700	7072500	swallowing an identity and making their identity or their
7072500	7075800	political party part of who they are as a person.
7077500	7080400	I have certain values right that I believe in.
7081700	7085400	More leftist progressive kind of things tend to fit with
7085400	7089000	most not all but most of those values tend to align with
7089000	7093200	them if that ever stopped being the case, right if that
7093200	7096400	ever changed I wouldn't follow the label.
7097300	7101300	I would follow the value and I think a lot of people are
7101300	7105800	the opposite of that they are invested in saying hey, I'm
7105800	7111100	a leftist or I'm a this and so if you are not this right
7111100	7114000	if you don't have the same beliefs I do you cannot be a
7114000	7120300	this and even when those parties change or those tribes
7120300	7125200	change they will cling to this and so they try to kind of
7125200	7129900	like gate keep the word or gate keep the label and push
7129900	7133200	people out that they disagree with and keep a pull in that
7133200	7136400	they don't but I don't get tied to it like that.
7136400	7138200	So to answer your question.
7138200	7140800	How do we get people to come to a common understanding?
7140900	7143700	I don't I don't give a shit what someone says it's conservative
7143700	7144100	or not.
7144100	7145900	I'm like, okay conservative cool.
7146100	7147300	What are they actually saying?
7147800	7149900	What's their proposal right?
7149900	7151200	What are they advocating for?
7151200	7152900	Is that good or is that bad?
7153000	7155400	It's very simplified way of thinking it but it is what it
7155400	7158100	is then I'll be okay with it or not.
7158100	7160200	I don't I don't care if they call it conservative or not.
7160800	7163100	What do you know that's a hundred a hundred percent fair.
7164800	7167600	I would say even growing up when talking politics with my
7167600	7170500	family, they would always like to label me.
7170500	7173500	Oh, wait, you are are you conservative you libertarian
7173800	7177800	you neoliberal and I always kind of yeah shocked those
7178300	7181500	labels and much rather like what's your opinion on this
7181500	7182100	and this?
7184000	7185800	Because it can be very nuanced.
7186600	7187300	What do you think that?
7188800	7189400	Yeah, pretty much.
7189400	7192900	I mean, I'm kind of feel the same way right if I if if my
7192900	7197200	ideals like if society shifted in my ideals became known
7197200	7199500	as far right then that's what I would be I wouldn't care
7199500	7201100	too much right or far left.
7201100	7202200	I still wouldn't care too much.
7202500	7204000	So okay, I guess I guess that's where I am.
7204000	7206400	I guess I'm far left or far right now fine fine.
7206800	7209200	What matters are the ideas themselves, right?
7209400	7212800	And here's the thing when it comes to when you're arguing
7212800	7215700	over labels rather than arguing over ideas.
7216000	7220100	What's really happening there is you're trying to place
7220100	7222800	a moral judgment on someone right?
7222900	7227000	So so for example, like when someone calls you a fascist
7227600	7229900	let's say they're left-wing and they call you a fascist.
7230200	7233800	What they're really saying is you're you are bad thing
7233800	7236300	and therefore you should you therefore you should be about
7236300	7237700	it. It's a moral judgment, right?
7238000	7240700	And the issue ultimately the issue ultimately is that if
7240700	7244200	you were to actually meet a real fascist someone who genuinely
7244200	7246400	believed in those values and thought they were good.
7247100	7249300	They wouldn't be insulted by you calling them a fascist.
7249300	7251100	They just be like, yeah, that's that's what I am right.
7251100	7252900	They wouldn't it wouldn't be an insult.
7253100	7256600	So the idea of attaching moral weights to labels and then
7256600	7257600	slapping people with them.
7257600	7260300	It doesn't really work and it really doesn't work to actually
7260300	7261700	discredit ideas, right?
7261700	7267800	Like everyone everyone everyone on Twitch poll, I think at
7267800	7270400	one point or another probably even including myself frankly
7270700	7275000	has simply used fascist as like a sentence ender or like
7275000	7278400	like an argument ender where it's like, well, you believe
7278400	7279800	in X policy.
7279800	7281900	Well, that's a fascist policy and it's like well, what's
7281900	7282700	the rest of the argument?
7282900	7285500	That's the rest of the argument that's being smuggled in
7285500	7287700	there is fascism is immoral.
7287700	7290100	So you shouldn't believe in this policy, right?
7290300	7294200	But that's frankly not a good enough not a good enough way
7294200	7295300	to talk to argue him up.
7295300	7298100	And I actually think this is a conversation win the argument
7298100	7301200	for a long time though, but it's always I think it's not
7301200	7302900	good enough anymore getting to that point where people are
7302900	7303900	seeing through it, right?
7304300	7306800	Well, it ships the argument because you have to defend yourself
7306800	7310400	not being a fascist over whatever you were originally talking
7310400	7312800	about. Well, there's there is that but there's also the fact
7312800	7314500	that you know seven or eight years ago.
7314500	7315500	It was racist, right?
7315500	7316300	Everyone's like you're racist.
7316300	7316700	You're racist.
7316700	7319900	You're white male racist, but that got to a point where
7319900	7323300	now no one gives a shit if you're called a racist sometimes
7323300	7324300	they'll just be like, yes, I am.
7324300	7324700	Fuck you.
7324700	7327200	Just just like him to fuck off, you know, and then which
7327200	7329300	by the way one that has allowed a lot of real racist
7329300	7331300	to get smuggled back into the conversation, right?
7331500	7334700	But secondly it they've now had to shift to a different
7334700	7337100	word and right now the word is fascist and we're approaching
7337100	7339800	that point to where nobody cares.
7340400	7341200	It's not there yet.
7341200	7342700	Maybe another six months to a year.
7342900	7345700	Nobody cares if they call you a fascist anymore in the which
7345700	7348400	by the way one that allows fascist to come back in the
7348400	7353100	conversation, but to that offers no argument against fascism's
7354300	7354900	here you go.
7354900	7357800	Here the optics go out the window fascism's positive qualities,
7357800	7359100	which it does have some right.
7359100	7362000	So like you have to you have to balance this where it's
7362000	7364400	like you have to actually argue against the policies themselves
7364400	7368200	and not really care what label they're under the the winner
7368200	7372600	in the story of the boy who cried wolf was the wolf and
7372700	7378100	you're exactly right the people when you are watering down
7378100	7381700	and flattening a term so that it just has very little meaning
7381700	7382300	anymore.
7382600	7386000	It helps the people who are actually those things to as
7386000	7390200	you say get smuggled back into society because the accusation
7390200	7393200	holds no way because it's very important right when someone
7393200	7398000	is doing fascist things that actually will be authoritarian
7398000	7401000	take away democracy take away people's freedoms of choice
7401200	7402600	take away people's free speech.
7402600	7407300	Etc to be able to tell people that and rather than go through
7407300	7409800	a whole litany shorthand is useful.
7410500	7413600	But again, we've over overplayed our hand.
7414000	7414600	I agree with you.
7414600	7415100	Yeah.
7415900	7419700	Actually here to to bring food shops back up again.
7419700	7421900	I had a had this conversation with her like last week.
7422000	7425700	Okay, and well, I was trying to explain this idea to her
7425700	7428100	basically and it was basically that okay if you're gonna talk
7428100	7431400	to a like a real fascist if you just because I think I think
7431400	7434200	she talked to Big Papa fascist at one point and like you
7434200	7438000	can't just scream about how your opponent's ideals are immoral
7438000	7440500	because they don't share that that that view of it with you.
7440500	7441600	So it's not an argument to them.
7441900	7443800	You have to she says in the chat.
7443800	7444800	I live in dev walls.
7444800	7445200	Fuck you.
7445400	7448000	Okay, so so listen listen what you have to actually do many
7448000	7448700	times you bring her up.
7448700	7449200	So go ahead.
7449200	7449500	Okay.
7449500	7449700	Okay.
7449700	7449900	Yeah.
7449900	7451900	Yeah, we have what you have to do is you actually have to
7451900	7458100	show how their own positive qualities are not fulfilled by
7458100	7459800	the Paul by the policies they want to implement right?
7459800	7462300	So for example, if you talk to a fascist and assuming he's
7462300	7463000	honest with you.
7463200	7466600	He'll say that like order is a great positive quality in
7466600	7467300	society, right?
7467300	7468500	Like you want an orderly society.
7468500	7470600	That's why that's why they're so strict with things right,
7470800	7474800	but then you realize that once you what once you centralized
7474800	7479200	all power into the great leader into one person your society
7479400	7482600	be that's a single point of failure for society, right?
7482800	7486100	So, you know hypothetically if Joe Biden is assassinated
7486100	7488900	today America will have a crisis.
7489100	7490300	It may even go to war.
7490600	7493400	However, your government doesn't collapse because you have
7493400	7496700	chain of command you have succession things are set up and
7496700	7499200	power is devolved to hundreds or thousands of different
7499200	7501500	people in hundreds of thousands of different offices all
7501500	7505200	over the country, right if you assassinate Hitler Nazi Germany
7505200	7510800	dies and so when the fascist says I want order you have to
7510800	7513700	be able to show them that well you might want order but the
7513700	7517400	way you set up your society is act does not actually guarantee
7517400	7521200	any order and in fact liberal democracies in their decentralization
7521200	7523100	guarantee more order, right?
7523100	7527000	So there is in my opinion a good argument against fascism
7527200	7530400	and I didn't once have to soy out about how immoral it is.
7531100	7531700	You know what I mean?
7532500	7536800	You didn't have to yeah, but no, thank you my alibi for calling
7536800	7537900	it a great topic.
7537900	7538800	Great question.
7539300	7540800	Is there anything else you have before we let you go?
7541900	7544700	Um, no, not really that kind of covers it.
7545100	7548800	The only other like before you throw me off into the void
7549100	7553100	would say I would guess like while there are select few
7553100	7556100	people who would welcome the label fascist.
7556500	7562000	I think there are a lot of people that if the term that
7562000	7565400	would readily like deny it just because kind of like you
7565400	7569500	were saying they think morally different they disagree
7569500	7572000	with you, but they're like the moral outcomes of what
7572400	7577200	their beliefs are wouldn't make them believe their effect.
7577200	7580300	Yeah, we're the one of the reasons we're so hesitant to
7580300	7584100	take a good conservative or good progressive or good leftist
7584300	7590200	whatever whatever ideology you think of as bad is because
7590200	7594200	we have spent so much time and so much so much blood sweat
7594200	7598300	and tears has been spent as tying that political label of
7598300	7599900	our enemies to be evil.
7600300	7603600	And so they can't have a good idea because they are evil
7604100	7607700	and this is a problem and it's made it very very hard to
7607700	7611000	work with each other and very very hard to work across
7611000	7614300	the aisle every time someone on one team or the other tries
7614300	7615600	to work with the other team.
7615700	7618700	They are seen as traitors in a lot of ways to and are often
7618700	7619500	primary now.
7619500	7621000	It's a big problem.
7621100	7623600	It's something we have to I don't know what to do about
7623600	7625700	it, but it's something we're going to have to deal with
7625700	7626900	at some point, right?
7627000	7629000	Well another part of the another part of this conversation
7629000	7633100	though something you mentioned earlier my my alibi is that
7633100	7635200	they wouldn't say that they're fascist and a lot of that
7635200	7637300	comes down to like if you were to like go to Nick Fuentes,
7637300	7639300	for example and say are you a fascist?
7639300	7641800	He'll probably say no and what he'll say is you mean I'm
7641800	7644300	obviously not you know, a member of the Italian fascist
7644300	7648800	party or the Nazi German party, you know because fascism
7648900	7653100	today looks very different from fascism back then right
7653100	7655800	and because ideas do change and like like the liberals of
7655800	7657400	today are not the same thing as the liberals of a hundred
7657400	7658200	years ago, right?
7658500	7662600	So things do like there is a genealogy you can trace back
7662600	7665000	through through political ideologies to see where things
7665000	7669700	came from but today's fascists are not the same thing
7670600	7674400	as Mussolini in 1910 coming up with a new ideology, you
7674400	7674900	know what I mean?
7675200	7677600	So they would probably it's a word game.
7678000	7682100	But if you're educated enough on why the policies are bad,
7682100	7685500	you don't need to you don't need to do the moral condemnation
7686200	7688300	educating ourselves as streamers.
7688300	7689200	What are you talking about?
7689200	7690200	What are you talking about?
7692600	7694700	To the void to the void.
7694800	7695700	They kicked him out.
7695800	7696200	I did.
7696200	7698000	Well, he I told him he's gonna go to the void.
7698100	7699000	I let him listen.
7699000	7699900	Look listen chat.
7699900	7702200	If you want to if you want to go down another rabbit hole
7702400	7706400	of weird fringe ideologies that like only if like a dozen
7706400	7710900	people actually follow go to the Wikipedia page for a
7710900	7712200	narco nationalism.
7713200	7715500	Okay, narco nationalism.
7715500	7718600	I've heard of narco capitalism, but narco nationalism.
7718600	7719000	Isn't that?
7719000	7722000	Yeah, so yeah, so you have like a narco capitalism.
7722000	7724500	You have a narco socialism, narco communism, syndicalism
7724700	7725500	primitivism.
7726700	7729500	You can definitely find a narco nationalism.
7730200	7732000	Okay, so okay.
7732000	7733900	I I just this is like that.
7733900	7735600	Yeah, I'll give you the I'll give you the tldr.
7735600	7738900	Okay, so yeah briefly because I don't want to get National
7739300	7744400	National anarchists syncretize ethnic nationalism with philosophical
7744400	7747200	anarchism in their support for a stateless society.
7747800	7751700	So they they're against they don't want a state.
7751700	7754900	They don't want a government but they do want a unified
7754900	7758800	society based on some sort of tribal lines whether it's
7758800	7763000	ethnic or racial or religious or something that unites
7763000	7766700	them together with like a very strict in-group out-group
7766700	7769700	view of the world, but there's no government and no state.
7771700	7775100	Okay, you know why we can just label all of those things
7775100	7776700	into the retarded category.
7777300	7780100	Well, if you look at a lot of the people that left-wingers
7780100	7784400	mistakenly call fascist nowadays, they do kind of line up
7784400	7787700	with with an narco nationalist ideas, which is kind of fun
7787900	7789200	because like like Nick Fuentes.
7789200	7791300	He definitely applies as an narco nationalist.
7791300	7794500	I can I can have based on that very brief description you've
7794500	7796800	given he hits a lot of the boxes.
7798300	7802400	It's it's it's one of those things where it sounds I wonder
7802400	7805000	how many of people say that there are these things just
7805000	7808300	to sound crazy or to sound different or to be unique or
7808300	7810100	whatever right to be edgy.
7810100	7810600	Yeah.
7810900	7814200	I'm sure you've seen like Twitter accounts or they'll post
7814200	7818600	like, you know this very specific type of this one leftist
7818600	7821800	writer who's part of this one movement from some country
7821800	7825300	70 years ago and that's the the specific strain of leftist
7825300	7828400	thought I believe in and it's like we all know you're just
7828500	7830500	you're just sitting around on your underwear eating fucking
7830500	7834800	chicken tendies and watching YouTube streams of bread tubers
7834800	7838400	and that's that's all you are true, but they got to make
7838400	7839200	it sound good, right?
7839200	7841100	Let's bring on the next contestant on whatever the fuck
7841100	7841700	this is.
7844000	7850400	Ali your life you are what a man what you got for us brother.
7851200	7851600	All right.
7851600	7856600	So I was wondering societally I've been watching and I feel
7856600	7860900	like things are going like more red pill blue pill, right?
7861900	7863800	Have you seen elaborate on that?
7864400	7866900	Yeah in terms of dating in terms of like ideology.
7866900	7870300	It seems like a lot of young people are really responsive
7870500	7873800	and they're really like hype to follow red pill ideology.
7873800	7877400	So the sneakers the fresh and fits of the world and I feel
7877400	7880600	like in that war that's happening that cultural war.
7880800	7883900	The only reason they're winning is because they have something
7883900	7886300	to offer or it like seems like they have something to offer.
7886300	7890600	So in terms of like money bitches cars profits all that shit.
7890600	7892600	That's what they have and the blue pill side has nothing
7892600	7893300	to offer.
7893900	7896800	So I feel like how do you combat that if you if you disagree
7896800	7900500	with with the ideology that that works for young people
7900500	7902900	specific is like specifically because if you're older you
7902900	7905000	can see through the bullshit, but when you're young, it's
7905000	7907000	really flashing you're like, ooh.
7907700	7910500	Well, I think this is a problem that solves itself as you
7910500	7916400	said it appeals to very young set demographic generally
7916800	7920900	and I think experience is the wisest teacher right and
7922100	7924800	I guess it's cyclical because every generation says this
7924800	7927800	is like well, we know better than the generation that came
7927800	7930500	before but I wish a generation that's coming after us would
7930500	7931700	listen to our experience, right?
7931700	7933200	So it's like a cyclical thing.
7933600	7937800	I think this is just a combination of social media the
7937800	7942400	incentives for that combined with like a noise amplification
7943500	7946200	of these very specific ideologies.
7946700	7951300	I I don't worry about it too much because I think that at
7951300	7956400	the end of the day the because when you say red pill that's
7956400	7957400	way too broad.
7957600	7959000	There are some red pill ideas.
7959000	7961700	I actually agree with well, I wanted to say conservative
7961700	7964200	and liberal but it wasn't I don't know if it's necessarily
7964200	7966400	that yeah again, that's way too broad.
7968300	7973600	Again, because it we have we can't think of it as so binary
7973600	7976600	as all that I think that there's a lot of people who are
7976600	7983100	pointing to structural issues that men have in in culture,
7983200	7987700	right in Western cultures and dating cultures that are just
7987700	7992700	true, but then they'll try to sell you a false kind of fix
7993000	7996100	and I think that what the blue pill could do quote-unquote
7996700	7999500	is simply expose that and say now these they're lying to you
7999500	8003800	and this is how and also we need better and I know this is
8003800	8008800	maybe cliche to say but we need better role models on the
8008800	8013300	more left-leaning spectrum that a don't get exposed as a sex
8013300	8016300	pest. Okay, that's a big one that we're having a problem
8016300	8023100	with for whatever reason and P they need to be able to show
8023100	8025000	hate to be able to explain.
8025100	8029200	Okay, you may be struggling now, but I promise after high
8029200	8031700	school it gets better because I didn't get many bitches
8031700	8032300	in high school.
8032700	8033400	But look at me now.
8033900	8035800	Okay, I got my own YouTube channel.
8036400	8039900	Are you getting tons of bitches now with look I'm swimming
8039900	8040700	by the troll.
8040700	8041900	Okay, moving me.
8042700	8043800	Well here here.
8043800	8045300	I'll jump in here, right?
8045400	8048600	So on some level what you're describing is I think just
8048600	8053700	impossible young people will always be attracted to radical
8053700	8056700	ideologies is just a part of growing up and there's
8056700	8058200	psychological reasons for this right?
8058200	8062400	Like if you if you read like Piaget's work on developmental
8062400	8066900	psychology, you realize that the experience of going through
8066900	8070400	puberty and experience and you're just personally experience
8070800	8075300	massive radical changes that are like half out of your control
8076300	8081000	that experience tends to lead young people to also realize
8081000	8085500	that a lot of society should also go through radical change
8085500	8089100	so that they may fit into society right because they are
8089100	8091100	different from the old paradigm.
8091200	8093700	This is a very common thing that people go through when
8093700	8095600	they're in their late teens in their early 20s.
8095600	8099600	It's just it's a part of human psychology and generally after
8099700	8102800	they go through this this phase of wanting to radically
8102800	8106600	reorder the world sometimes they do actually end up having
8106600	8108100	good ideas and how to reorder the world.
8108100	8109600	Sometimes the ideas are bullshit.
8109600	8111000	Sometimes they do reorder the world.
8111000	8114400	Sometimes they don't but either way after this psychological
8114400	8115400	period is done.
8115800	8119700	They tend to be more amenable to fitting into what society
8119700	8121400	is in reality.
8121900	8124600	And that doesn't mean that older people can't enact change
8124600	8128900	they can but but basically there we are psychologically primed
8129100	8135000	to want to engage in revolution in in in let's say our early
8135000	8138400	adult life and I guess that makes sense because if there
8138400	8141600	was a change that needed to be made that's when we are young
8141600	8144300	enough and strong enough and capable enough to to do it.
8144400	8145100	So I guess it makes sense.
8145100	8147400	It would happen then but also you lack the wisdom to be able
8147400	8147900	to do it, right?
8147900	8153200	So on some level you can't like outside ideologies red pill
8153200	8157000	stuff socialism even fascism, whatever it is stuff that is
8157000	8160600	not the current social norm that will always appeal to young
8160600	8161100	people.
8161300	8166800	It will always draw them in the only thing it was.
8166800	8167100	Yes.
8167300	8167600	Yes.
8168700	8173000	So the only thing you can really do is to understand that
8173000	8176300	a lot of young people will be doing this and that your society
8176300	8180200	is properly structured that they have viable off-ramps to
8180200	8182700	rejoin society when they're done with it, right?
8182700	8183400	So it's like, okay.
8183400	8185400	Yeah, you were LARPing as a revolutionary when you were in
8185400	8188000	high school or when you were in college, but you have a
8188000	8190700	college degree now and you can actually get a decent job
8190700	8193200	and you can actually, you know, find a girlfriend and buy
8193200	8196000	a house and become a regular member of society as long as
8196000	8200300	society is structured to grant some leeway to people who
8200300	8203700	are going through this phase and still provide them with
8203700	8207900	ways to integrate into society and and frankly even take
8207900	8210600	on some of their new ideas if they have if they happen to
8210600	8213700	be worth some something as long as our society is set up
8213700	8217500	like that, then they will naturally de-radicalize on their
8217500	8220800	own. But if our society is not set up like that and there's
8220800	8222700	some evidence it's not currently set up like that.
8222900	8225600	That's when you start to have lifelong revolutionaries and
8225600	8227600	you start to have massive social upheaval.
8227800	8230500	And I think that's the current problem facing liberal democracies
8230500	8231000	right now.
8232800	8233400	Response.
8235100	8236500	Okay understood.
8236600	8237900	I was just saying I'm just saying it.
8237900	8242100	So I from what I understood you feel so from what I got then
8242400	8243900	the society is pretty liberal right now.
8243900	8246200	So then the radical thing would be to go conservative and
8246200	8247900	everyone's just going conservative and you think that'll
8247900	8250500	even out in a little bit or you think that the conservatives
8250500	8254000	offer the conservative conservative side actually offers
8254000	8258500	something structural for people to like respond to it's both
8258700	8261400	it's both right conservative critiques of liberalism.
8261400	8264100	There there does seem to be a fair amount of meat on that
8264100	8264600	bone.
8265200	8268400	So it's not like they're just there's radical for the sake
8268400	8272700	of being radical right, but as long as liberal society is
8272700	8275300	capable of taking the good critiques and also taking the
8275300	8277600	people that believe them those people will naturally
8277600	8278900	de-radicalize right.
8279200	8281300	So I guess the issue like for example, you look at like
8281300	8284700	people who follow and Andrew Tate as a good example, right
8284800	8287400	and like there are young boys who are who are now, you know
8287400	8290900	devaluing women and and chasing money and you know, they're
8290900	8293300	not be like they're being alpha males, but they're not
8293300	8295900	being positive examples of what an alpha male should be
8296000	8296400	right.
8296400	8297000	That's that's big.
8299000	8299200	Yeah.
8299200	8299800	Yeah that too.
8299900	8302200	But like it like you can't deny that Andrew Tate's an alpha
8302200	8304400	male, but he's a very negative alpha male if that makes sense,
8304400	8304800	right?
8305000	8308300	So you have you have young guys that are that are looking
8308400	8313400	at that situation and in an ideal society, they would meet
8313600	8319100	maybe a decent woman who would be kind and interested in them
8319100	8321500	as long as they themselves were of course able to attract
8321500	8324500	her and then maybe they would have a real relationship and
8324500	8327000	he would realize that, you know, the scales would fall from
8327000	8328600	his eyes and he would realize oh my God.
8328600	8331100	I've believed completely wrong things about women this
8331100	8335000	whole time because you know having having a propagandist
8335000	8337800	tell you for years what women's true nature actually is
8337800	8340000	and then when you finally fucking meet one for the first
8340000	8342900	time, you know, the reality of it isn't doesn't stand up
8342900	8347400	to to the propaganda right, but if it's now harder to meet
8347400	8351500	women and it is and let's say the the ways in which you
8351500	8355000	would traditionally meet women it's now become more taboo
8355000	8357700	to do like at work or at the gym or at the store and it
8357700	8361600	is and maybe some of the ways in which you might meet a
8361600	8365800	woman which is you know on an app the types of women who
8365800	8369700	are on those apps they reinforce negative stereotypes of
8369700	8372100	women rather than dispelling them and that also seems to
8372100	8376700	be somewhat the case now you have like a cauldron where
8376700	8378900	radicalization is only going to continue and there's no
8378900	8379900	real off-ramp.
8380000	8381800	It's just going it's just going to bubble up and continue
8381800	8386100	to cook and so like it's funny because you see like a
8386100	8390000	lot of let's say to be to be not so kind right-wing schizos
8390000	8393000	on Twitter who desperately want the trad wife, but none
8393000	8394500	of them are going to church right?
8394600	8397400	None of them are going to church to meet any of the girls
8397400	8399100	because those girls do exist there right?
8399200	8402800	None of them are at University instead of partying.
8402800	8404100	They're in the library.
8404100	8406700	They don't even want them realistically they can claim
8406700	8408500	that they want them but the end of the day they really
8408500	8410900	want they want the hose that they claim that to hate.
8410900	8413300	So it's just like it's the same thing with the Muslim
8413300	8415700	if they want the four wives, but none of the people that
8415700	8418200	none of the girls dads are going to approve of that marriage
8418200	8420000	anyways to those people because you're not good enough
8420000	8420700	for that girl.
8421600	8424500	Yeah, it's a you're correct dev when you say that there's
8424500	8425900	like this kind of storm brewing.
8425900	8430400	We haven't really learned to deal with the new reality
8430400	8431400	that we are in right?
8431400	8435400	We haven't learned as a culture how to respond to and I
8435400	8438000	hate to use this canard, but the social media problem
8438500	8440200	and it is a problem and it's going to be something
8440200	8443000	that we're going to have to figure out rules of the road
8443000	8446100	for right figure out ways to handle it and to adjust
8446100	8451400	to everything being everywhere all at once and I think
8451400	8455400	that one of the things that's going to have to happen
8455600	8459100	are a lot of these things that have become denormalized
8459100	8462900	or stigmatized such as meeting people or talking to people
8462900	8467600	at the grocery store or the gym right approaching people
8467800	8469900	right that needs to become okay again.
8470300	8472200	It used to be okay back in my day.
8472200	8474200	It was okay, right when I was in my 20th.
8474300	8475300	You just go up.
8475500	8476500	Hey, I think you're cute.
8476500	8478900	You want to go get a coffee sometime sometimes be polite
8478900	8479200	about it.
8479200	8479400	Now.
8479400	8480700	Sometimes it'd be mean about it.
8480700	8482300	Sometimes they'd agree to it, right?
8482300	8483300	It really depended.
8484900	8490600	We need to we need to stop stigmatizing that and the adults
8490600	8493000	need to step up and say hey kids.
8493000	8495400	I know sometimes when someone approaches you with something
8495400	8497200	you don't like it can make you uncomfortable,
8497300	8499400	but that doesn't make them a bad person that doesn't mean
8499400	8501200	they're out to get you that doesn't mean they've harmed
8501200	8502000	you in any way.
8502200	8505100	You can simply learn how to say no and her learn how to
8505100	8509600	be assertive rather than weaponize your mental mental
8509600	8513900	instability and weaponize your social problems and sort
8513900	8518800	of an inability to be able to communicate and say that
8518800	8521400	oh, well, they're the bad guy because they're asking me
8521400	8522800	a fucking normal question.
8522800	8525100	I don't know anything else for us Ali.
8525800	8528700	No, just back to my original point is just that doesn't
8528700	8531500	sound as nice and glamorous as just do this and you'll
8531500	8532700	get the you'll fuck bitches.
8532700	8536200	Yeah, the marketing's got to change up.
8536200	8537000	But thank you, man.
8540500	8543300	What do you think of that social media take though?
8543500	8544600	I'm really curious.
8544600	8548500	I think that most of the problems we have today can be laid
8548500	8552800	at the feet in one way or another of social media specifically.
8553500	8557300	I mean when I was younger social media basically existed
8557300	8560700	to help facilitate offline stuff.
8561200	8563500	You get in touch with people so that you can go to a party
8563500	8566400	together or that you could it was it was a tool but it wasn't
8566400	8567300	your entire life.
8567600	8570200	Now social media is people's entire lives and that's bad
8570900	8574400	unless you're watching me on social media gang in which
8574400	8577600	case you should like and subscribe to my channel and live
8577600	8580500	vicariously through Wix discord.
8580500	8582600	You can try my conversations.
8582600	8585400	But yeah, listen, listen, if you super chat you can get
8585400	8587900	this pair of social relationship going wick will actually
8587900	8589700	be your real life friend Roo.
8589900	8593600	Hey with enough money anything is possible friends anything
8593600	8594000	at all.
8594500	8596300	Let me bring on the next contestant.
8597600	8598600	What you got for us?
8602300	8603200	Gentlemen.
8604800	8605200	Hello.
8605500	8606600	Hi, you're live.
8607600	8610900	Oh first and foremost, I've been listening for pretty much
8610900	8611400	the whole time.
8611400	8612200	So there's a lot of stuff.
8612200	8615100	I kind of want to go back first back to you guys is like
8615100	8616000	three guests ago.
8616200	8619600	You were having a unilateral disarmament argument about
8619600	8622800	how one side does something the other side is either forced
8622800	8627600	to or unilaterally disarming and wick said we live in a
8627600	8630700	liberal democracy where you can go and say we're the side
8630700	8632900	with morals and an ideal world.
8632900	8634400	Thank you are a hundred percent, right?
8634400	8637200	I wish we lived in that world but in reality we live in
8637200	8640500	a very partisan atmosphere where you can tell your side
8640500	8643100	where the moral people while also going out and being the
8643100	8646500	scumbag and your side will find small reasons to stand
8646500	8649700	up for you and damn the other side for very very similar
8649700	8650400	actions.
8650600	8653100	So unfortunately practically that doesn't work out as well
8653100	8653900	as I'd hope.
8654600	8657100	Oh, it's not a it's not like it's not a panacea.
8657300	8659900	It's not a bomb of Gilead that will heal all our wounds,
8659900	8660400	right?
8660500	8666400	But in the long term like playing the long game over several
8666400	8672100	iterations of elections of news cycles Etc.
8673100	8675800	I stand by this it works.
8675900	8680900	There is a reason that we swung leftward after the 90s,
8680900	8684900	right after the 80s and 90s where people saw that the right
8684900	8687800	wing was full of shit on their free speech like they would
8687800	8692500	ban books and all these things anti freedom anti video game
8692500	8694900	and to all these things right the anti fun party.
8696800	8699900	We took the wrong lessons from that and we think well,
8699900	8701300	that's when they had power.
8701400	8703400	This is what they were doing when they had power.
8703500	8704900	So it must be what works.
8705000	8707700	So the left started adopting shit like that.
8708500	8711800	Oh, yeah, that's a wrong lesson because that's that I would
8711800	8716300	pause it is why they lost power and again a more liberalizing
8716300	8719400	society more liberalizing culture and over the years we
8719400	8720400	have been more liberalizing.
8720400	8722400	So yes, you won't win every election.
8722500	8723900	You may not win the next election.
8724000	8726400	But again over a long enough period of time over several
8726400	8730300	iterations, you will win if you stick to it if you can message
8730300	8733400	control enough if you can again, there's a lot of ifs here.
8733600	8734600	It's not a perfect thing.
8734800	8737800	But if you can message control enough if you can take control
8737800	8741700	of enough of your of your party of your ideology of your
8741700	8745800	apparatus, whatever you want to call it and kind of say hey,
8745800	8746900	these are our values.
8746900	8748600	We don't fuck with our values.
8748600	8752100	Even if it's politically expedient to do so no one's
8752100	8753000	actually doing that.
8753000	8754200	So it's probably yeah.
8754200	8755600	I just didn't want to rehash the whole thing.
8755600	8757100	I just kind of wanted to throw that point in there because
8757100	8760000	I thought about it like you are correct technically, but
8760000	8761800	unfortunately practically doesn't work out as much like
8761800	8765600	that as I hope the next point is dev was talking about how
8765600	8769900	an inherent trait of fascism is an autocratic leader and
8770700	8773600	looking at some of the ideals of fascism you can almost
8774600	8778800	Implement or theory craft a way to have democratic fascism
8778800	8781400	where you wouldn't have that one autocratic central figure
8781400	8784800	that the government lives and dies by I'm not endorsing it
8784800	8785200	or anything.
8785200	8789500	I'm just saying I could envision a retelling of fascism to
8789500	8794700	be more of a congressional or parliamentary government as
8794700	8796000	opposed to an autocratic one.
8796000	8799500	Well, I mean Mussolini already did that right with the Grand
8799500	8800500	Council of fascism.
8800500	8800900	Yeah.
8800900	8801400	Yeah.
8802200	8804500	I'm so basically like fascinated.
8804900	8810700	Well, what basically what it was was in Italy any Italian
8810700	8815200	citizen could join the fascist party and then get elected
8815200	8819600	to the Grand Council of fascism right now wasn't like it
8819600	8824000	was a democracy and that people voted but it was not a democracy
8824000	8827700	because it was a one-party democracy right like you had multiple
8827700	8830900	different strains of fascism that were competing but no one
8830900	8833100	who is not a fascist could be in the government if that
8833100	8833900	makes sense, right?
8834000	8838000	So like it was it was kind of democratic right, but but it's
8838000	8843300	still ultimately all of that like under structure still ultimately
8843300	8846400	hinged on Mussolini being in control of everything and once
8846400	8849400	Mussolini was gone the entire thing collapsed to you.
8849400	8852800	I agree with you a hundred percent but like the he in a sense
8852800	8855300	it's because they're going through the change still once
8855300	8857800	you have that government established and you have that machine
8858000	8861000	well-oiled enough to sustain on its own it might take a couple
8861000	8863800	of decades, but I could see I'm just saying hypothetically
8863800	8866700	I'd see a version of fascism that isn't Central the Rock centralized
8866900	8869700	around one person in the state that it actually worked in which
8869700	8873000	I could argue that like, you know, like South Korea kind of
8873000	8878100	did you mean North Korea or no South Korea wasn't the where
8878100	8880800	they considered one of the seven fascist governments in the
8880800	8881800	world at one point.
8882900	8884000	I don't think so.
8884000	8884400	Look it up.
8884400	8885300	Might be true.
8885700	8886700	I don't have to read the book.
8886800	8887200	Let me see.
8887200	8887800	Let me see.
8889800	8893500	I know like Portugal and Spain were Romania Germany Italy
8893500	8894100	Japan.
8895500	8901100	I mean South Korea and and Taiwan both had nationalist governments
8901500	8905300	in the face of of like their like the socialist parties taking
8905300	8908600	over in Japan North Korea and then in China, right and they
8908600	8910900	had nationalist governments that eventually transitioned into
8910900	8911900	liberal democracies.
8912900	8914500	But were they fascist?
8914500	8916200	I'm not sure maybe it's possible.
8916700	8918000	I have to check the reference.
8918500	8919400	They weren't fascist.
8919400	8922700	It was a nationalist saying like I forget the guy's name, right
8922700	8926200	there their leader whatever they got kicked out.
8926200	8928400	They lost the war and they got kicked out to Taiwan to kind
8928400	8930300	of like as a last bastion and stuff.
8930700	8935600	But yeah, that kind of went away as well after the leadership
8935600	8939100	died. So yeah, so those were just two honorable mentions.
8939100	8940700	I wanted to my main point.
8940800	8943400	My main point is that we don't really have conservatism in
8943400	8944500	the United States anymore.
8944700	8947500	We have newer versions of liberalism versus older versions
8947500	8948300	of liberalism.
8949100	8951400	If you look at a lot of the history behind the libertarian
8951400	8953800	movement, this would go back to like the Mises Institute
8953800	8954800	writings and such.
8954900	8956900	I like Tom Woods if anyone's ever heard of him.
8956900	8960500	He's a really educated libertarian libertarians left the
8960500	8963600	Democratic Party around the time of World War Two because
8963600	8968200	they saw FDR as too autocratic of a leader for their ideals
8968200	8971400	and they slowly drifted to the right wing and the right wing
8971400	8973600	kind of has an idea of respect for institutions.
8973800	8978100	So they cut out their own anti-government quarter of the
8978100	8980300	right wing that actually kind of became a staple of the party
8980300	8983600	now. If you look at the inception of the Neocons, Neocons
8983600	8986300	were liberal Democrats for a long time.
8986400	8990500	They shifted away from the party when who was it Reagan?
8990500	8992600	I think they the first time they voted right wing was for
8992600	8997100	Reagan. And so they shifted into more of it was actually
8997100	8999000	meant as a pejorative and same thing with neoliberal.
8999000	9001700	These terms were originally pejorative and became the names
9001700	9004100	of these movements because they were people that switch
9004100	9007000	sides when the Democratic Party went a different way like
9007000	9009300	I said during that discussion.
9009300	9010900	I think they're still pejorative, right?
9010900	9014800	You know, you don't say neoliberal or neoconservative in
9014800	9015900	a positive sense.
9015900	9017400	I've never heard that right?
9018700	9021700	Yeah, I mean neoconservative is how like John Pott Horitz
9021700	9023000	at the commentary magazine.
9023100	9025300	His dad was one of the founders of the neoconservative
9025300	9027700	movement. He uses that term as endearment.
9028200	9029000	He's proud of it.
9029000	9030600	He just wrote a few months ago.
9030600	9031800	That's the exception.
9033500	9036100	And it doesn't doesn't Francis Fukuyama use neoliberal
9036100	9037000	positively too?
9037200	9039700	I think they're used positively a little bit. Fukuyama ended
9039700	9041300	history. He can do what the fuck he wants.
9041300	9042100	Okay, right.
9043300	9046000	liberal happily like I'm pretty pro-interventionist and
9046000	9048900	such so I would consider myself a neoliberal because I have
9048900	9052300	the core values of liberalism, but I also support that.
9052300	9054300	Uh, what's the word?
9054300	9056000	It's not meritocracy.
9056000	9057400	It's a fuck.
9057500	9062100	Technocracy the technocratic the status that the current
9062100	9065600	Democratic Party holds where they have a democratic elite
9065600	9068600	ruling elite, but they're made up of professionals that earn
9068600	9069500	their way there through merit.
9069500	9071900	Are you part of the only my friend?
9072800	9075100	No, no, I just support the fact that we need I'm a big about
9075100	9079500	specialization and think are you are you in the car?
9080200	9081100	That's what it sounds like.
9081100	9082100	He's like he's in a car.
9082600	9084100	Are you being are you okay?
9084100	9089900	Oh, come on Easter has camera.
9090100	9092100	I don't look I'm worried.
9092100	9095100	I'm concerned the camera is loading up.
9096500	9098600	I can't hear them either.
9098600	9100700	Can I okay buddy?
9100700	9102700	Well, thank you.
9103100	9104300	Thank you for calling in.
9105900	9107300	I wish he has gone to an accident.
9107300	9107800	Maybe more.
9107900	9108700	I hope not.
9108700	9109600	I hope he's okay.
9109600	9111100	That would be a feel really bad.
9112100	9113600	But I'm sending him to the way for now.
9114000	9117500	Um, I'm being told me think about let me think about that
9117500	9118000	for a minute.
9118000	9118800	What do you just said?
9119500	9122000	It's like I mean, he said like he might have been like an
9122000	9128600	NRX or something maybe but but I don't know I like what he
9128600	9132100	was saying was technically true like America's Republicans
9132100	9134600	are like older with with the exception of the Trump faction,
9134600	9137200	which is something new but like Americans Republicans before
9137200	9140500	Trump were like older liberals and then the Democrats were
9140500	9144500	like newer liberals if that makes sense like conservatism
9144500	9148500	as an ideology is just whatever the status quo is and so
9148500	9152400	for America because classical liberalism is the status quo
9152400	9154600	your conservatives are classical liberals, right?
9154800	9156500	However, if you if you're a conservative in the United
9156500	9159300	Kingdom, you're a monarchist which is different.
9159800	9162800	So I think it might be a little more nuanced than that.
9162800	9163200	Right?
9163200	9165900	I think that there are things such as conservative values.
9165900	9171700	I think that transcend the status quo, but I haven't thought
9171700	9174800	enough about it to really give it an educated kind of take
9174800	9175100	on it.
9175100	9177500	But this is just my instinct to be clear.
9178300	9183200	I think that look at the end of the day.
9183400	9188700	I think that there are more people today at least that vote
9188700	9193700	against things and they are that vote for so there is a lot
9193800	9198300	of people who are anti insert whatever here anti-right-wing
9198300	9200300	anti-left-wing and that's how they vote now.
9201400	9203900	They don't really vote for positive things anymore, but
9203900	9204800	that's just my instinct.
9204800	9206200	I don't have a point.
9207100	9210800	Not me that sounds about right to be like in retrospect.
9210800	9214600	I'm actually quite certain that the main reason Trump won
9215000	9219100	in 2016 is not because he was actually considered a better
9219100	9222900	candidate is that people really did not like Hillary Clinton.
9223000	9225400	Well, they did not like the status quo.
9225600	9226800	They didn't like that too.
9226900	9231300	The it was a I think Michael Moore described it as a firebomb
9231300	9233400	into the electorate right like that.
9233500	9236300	A lot of people just wanted to change shit.
9236400	9239800	That's why Bernie got close to Bernie Rose to National
9239800	9243400	Promise prominence, even though he was a politician for decades,
9243400	9243800	right?
9245900	9250300	He ran the reason he became kind of like this cause celeb
9250300	9254900	for a lot of people is a lot of people just do not like how
9254900	9255900	politics are right now.
9255900	9259800	They hate it trust in our institutions is dipping.
9259800	9263100	It's it's going lower and lower and lower every year.
9263300	9268500	They're perfectly valid reasons for that and there's some
9268900	9271400	some more silly reasons for that right?
9271400	9275000	It's beyond the scope of this discussion, but I think that
9275000	9279700	like the Venn diagram between Bernie voters and Trump voters
9280600	9283900	is bigger than you think for that reason is because both
9283900	9288100	candidates are seen as a fuck you to Washington, right?
9288600	9290500	There's a fuck you to the establishment.
9290500	9294100	So there's a lot of other things would have voted for Bernie
9294100	9294900	instead, right?
9295200	9298900	The main reason why I think Biden won in 2020 is because
9298900	9301600	after the fuck you vote, you know, we're not going to just
9301600	9304900	accept Hillary versus Jeb and no matter what happens.
9304900	9307100	We're you know, we get the same thing just with different
9307100	9309900	colors on it and we are going to choose something outside
9309900	9312400	the paradigm and they chose Trump and they had four years
9312400	9316000	of that and a lot of people I think realized oh shit at least
9316000	9318900	what's out outside the paradigm in this this instance was
9318900	9320200	really fucking bad.
9320200	9323400	Yeah, maybe the paradigm hat is it has a reason to exist.
9323900	9326400	So I think that's why things swung back in 2020.
9326400	9327300	Yeah, they realize.
9327300	9330300	Oh, no, we wanted change but not this change gang.
9330300	9332800	Please help and no, I think you're right.
9333100	9334900	Let's let's get through as many people as possible.
9334900	9336200	We only got a little bit of time left.
9336200	9340500	So we're going to rapid-fire these extra high.
9343700	9346600	Well, good evening gentlemen me howdy.
9346700	9347100	What's up?
9349000	9351000	Well, first of all Dev.
9351000	9353200	Thanks so much for staying some extra time.
9353600	9356600	I'm on the west coast over here and I just got off work.
9356600	9361700	So happy to have a chance to come in and say hello and second
9361700	9364300	of all there's a hundred and six people watching now on YouTube
9364300	9366300	and there are 16 likes what is wrong with you?
9367200	9367500	Get on.
9367500	9370000	I don't know why people don't like my shit like this is a
9370000	9372800	thing. This is not new to my experience.
9374700	9376000	You sound defeated wick.
9376000	9377000	I am defeated.
9377000	9380000	I've tried different things to get people to click that
9380000	9385400	goddamn like button, but for whatever reason they I'm stymied,
9385600	9386200	but it's okay.
9386200	9389000	They still watch and I still I still get five dollars from
9389000	9391400	Artemis Fowl for to say then explain the current swing back
9391400	9392500	in favor of Trump Dev.
9393200	9393700	Don't worry.
9394000	9401100	We'll talk more Artemis, but yeah, but anyway, what do you
9401100	9404600	got to say enough glossing me and love glazing dev here.
9404600	9405700	You can suck our dicks later.
9405900	9407300	But for now tell us why you're here.
9408300	9412300	Well, I think I like we're all we're all about changing our
9412300	9414400	minds here in the in the wick chat.
9415600	9419600	So I'd like to see if I can push dev a little bit about
9419600	9423200	changing his mind when it comes to the idea that you need
9423200	9427700	to censor in like teach a lesson so that then others know
9427700	9429700	what it was like to be censored in the first place.
9429800	9432300	There was a few callers back now, but I'd like to push
9432300	9432700	you out of that.
9432700	9433200	All right.
9433600	9434100	Okay, go ahead.
9435400	9438700	I don't know first of all if that can apply to populations
9438700	9441800	rather than like single individuals, right?
9441800	9444600	I can teach somebody that what they did was wrong by doing
9444600	9446600	it to them and like having them experience it.
9446700	9450100	But if I as a singular actor as a part of the left have
9450100	9453100	never done anything to censor and then get censored as a
9453100	9456400	retaliatory act then I have only all you've ever done there
9456400	9459700	is create another victim somebody who already now hates
9459700	9462400	the other side once again and you continue that cycle of
9462400	9463900	hatred. So what are your thoughts on that?
9465000	9465700	I mean, I agree.
9465900	9468300	Yes, you do have to do it on an individual level, right?
9468500	9472000	So for example, if you look at the people the reason we had
9472000	9474700	this conversation initially was because there were prominent
9474700	9477800	left-wing Twitter accounts getting banned one of them was
9477800	9481500	that fucking squirrel person who's like ridiculous, right?
9481500	9484200	They have done their share of censoring and now that they
9484200	9486800	are being censored as like, okay, maybe you can learn your
9486800	9487600	lesson, right?
9487700	9490700	You shouldn't just censor people who haven't done any censoring
9490700	9492400	even if they're aligned with other sensors.
9492400	9492800	That's true.
9492800	9493200	Yes.
9494000	9498200	Okay, and then secondly they mentioned something about
9499000	9501500	going back to war games and that there's no winning move
9501500	9505900	in a war game and I'm sure being people of the internet.
9505900	9507800	We're all familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma.
9508100	9511200	There's a couple weeks ago now a Veritasium video about
9511200	9514700	it and the Prisoner's Dilemma has winning outcomes.
9515500	9519800	The first initial winning move is a tit-for-tat where you
9519800	9523700	only reply in kind to any offense that's done to you.
9524000	9524700	Yeah, I saw this video.
9524700	9525400	Yeah, I know you're talking about.
9525400	9528300	Yeah, and then but generous does better than that right
9528300	9531400	occasionally giving back in and saying okay this time.
9531400	9533700	I'm not going to attack back even though you did to me that
9533700	9534500	does even better.
9535500	9536900	So do you have any argument against that?
9537900	9541600	So not not really because it does seem to be pretty much
9541600	9545300	true, but even in generous there is a point where you must
9545300	9548300	strike back and you cannot simply take it and take it and
9548300	9552600	take it and take it eternally and then do nothing right like
9552600	9556500	even it within generous like if you could take it eternally
9556500	9563300	if you I think even for the generous the generous algorithm
9563500	9566400	if it was faced with an algorithm that would simply attack
9566400	9569900	it relentlessly without any without changing a strategy
9569900	9570200	at all.
9570200	9572900	It would still attack back like it wouldn't it was it was
9572900	9574400	not eternally generous, right?
9574500	9577300	So there's there has to there has to be some limit where
9577300	9579300	you say, you know what, you know, I've given you a few
9579300	9579800	chances.
9579800	9582300	I've forgiven you a few times now you do actually have to
9582300	9585600	be hit back like you can't you there's no there's no pacifist
9585600	9586500	option here basically.
9588100	9588600	All right.
9589100	9590300	Well, that's everything I had for you guys.
9590300	9591200	I appreciate you so much.
9591200	9592800	We're doing we're doing rapid-fire gang.
9592800	9594200	So extra thank you for calling in.
9596900	9598900	Well, I see so yattle in the chat.
9599100	9601400	I've seen is so yattle following me around.
9601400	9603800	He's always in like things that I'm on viewer.
9603800	9605000	I don't know what to tell you.
9605100	9611000	Yeah, he's been on my show to write like okay here to bring
9611000	9612000	up the Forbidden Topic.
9612000	9614000	I was on food shops a stream and he was there too.
9614000	9617600	So I'm just like is it is he following me?
9618000	9618900	Is that what's going on?
9619100	9621700	He might be I mean that could be true.
9621700	9624200	He could be a wick viewer and following you at the same
9624200	9625000	time stalking you.
9625400	9628800	I don't know but so yattle is just a nice enough guy.
9629300	9632600	Let me bring on Tom Jones your life.
9637100	9637700	Hello.
9638300	9638600	Hi.
9638600	9639000	Hello.
9640800	9641700	Oh, this is exciting.
9641700	9642700	This is rapid-fire.
9642700	9644700	So let's uh, what you got?
9645700	9646900	I just say a big fan of you dev.
9646900	9648300	Anyway, so thank you.
9649300	9654500	Should be very only recent discovered you like but you seem
9654500	9656800	cool to you know, I'll give you that so it's quite the
9656800	9657700	question could be very broad.
9657700	9658900	I'll try to keep it narrow.
9659200	9662300	So in society today, we've become increasingly secular,
9662600	9666900	you know non belief in religion is on the rise and I want
9667200	9669700	know if you guys think that is the problem considering,
9669700	9671600	you know, pretty much every society throughout history
9671600	9673300	has been very religious.
9677000	9677800	What do you think wick?
9678900	9680900	I'm gonna be real.
9680900	9681900	I didn't hear the question.
9681900	9683300	I was looking at the DM.
9684400	9688500	Oh, it was it was about people becoming less religious over
9688500	9691900	time. And if it's a bad thing, I think that it's had some
9691900	9693300	negative consequences.
9693300	9694300	I don't know overall.
9694300	9694900	It's bad.
9695000	9698400	Like I hear all the time about people lacking community
9698600	9700100	about people being more atomized.
9700100	9705700	I think that the going away from being religious is partly
9705700	9706700	to blame for that.
9707000	9710200	We used to meet every Sunday in a house of worship at least
9710200	9714500	in America, right less and less people are doing that and
9714500	9719100	I think that has made it has had some negative consequences.
9719100	9721400	I think that regardless of what you believe in the truth
9721400	9722300	of religion.
9722600	9728300	The communal aspect of it is helpful in a lot of ways not
9728300	9731500	always there are some negatives to that too, but I think
9731500	9737400	that a lot of people are seeing the reverberations of this
9737400	9742000	destruction of communities and partly that sounds about right.
9742000	9743000	Yeah religion.
9745500	9748500	So do you think is anything that atheists or more secular
9748500	9752300	people can do to try and retake that concept of community?
9753000	9753500	Yes.
9756600	9761000	Get off get offline, right and start actually meeting
9761400	9765400	in person right a lot of the times what this would look
9765400	9769100	like in non-religious circles is going to like Community
9769100	9773000	Act activists stuff right like being involved in your community
9773700	9775500	to make it better in other ways.
9775700	9779300	Well another another benefit that religion had was the charity
9779300	9782300	work. It did I remember being a young Mormon growing up
9782300	9785700	and I would go every summer right we would go and we would
9785700	9789200	do hurricane relief things and we would go as a church like
9789200	9792600	as a youth group to go clean up the community centers, right
9792600	9796200	or clean up the parks or volunteer nursing homes Etc.
9797300	9801000	More of that without the religion would be grand.
9801300	9806300	And so I think that yes a lot of people can we need to we
9806300	9810500	need to incentivize people doing good for goodness sake
9810700	9816400	right rather than doing good if it'll get me likes and updo's
9816400	9817300	on social media.
9818300	9821200	Yeah, I mean atheists have a rough time with this because
9821500	9824700	at least if you have God then you have a commandment to
9824700	9828000	do it right there's some sort of universal moral force
9828000	9832400	that applies to everyone objectively and you can't really
9832400	9834800	argue against that because it's the ultimate moral arbiter
9834800	9836800	right but with a see a thesis that doesn't exist.
9837100	9841900	So it's it's much harder to to get atheists to do some
9841900	9845400	sort of community building without without that that moral
9845400	9846200	force behind them.
9848000	9849600	Anything else before we let you go?
9850400	9851700	That's all thank you.
9851700	9854000	I appreciate you guys and have a good rest of your night.
9854100	9854600	Bye.
9854600	9855200	Thank you again.
9855200	9855600	Thanks, man.
9856800	9860000	$15 from pondering politics who's blowing up on YouTube
9860000	9864400	right away to say yes, he's getting more views than I I
9864400	9866700	remember when I was a big boy, right and I was inviting
9866700	9868200	him on my platform like hike it.
9868300	9872500	I got 5,000 subscribers and now he's got like what 80,000
9872500	9873000	or some shit.
9873800	9875600	He's got a hundred and seven thousand.
9875600	9876900	Yeah, it's blowing up.
9876900	9879100	Like I said, so he's a he's doing well.
9879900	9881600	Oh, this is this is ruminate, right?
9882000	9882900	This is Josiah.
9883100	9885100	Well, I think you've talked to Josiah before have you?
9887100	9888300	Change his name from ruminate.
9888500	9888800	Yes.
9888800	9889200	I think so.
9889200	9889800	Yeah ruminate.
9889800	9890000	Yes.
9890000	9890300	Yes.
9890300	9892200	This is running ask.
9892200	9895500	I've I've I've spoken to him a little bit but only privately
9895500	9900700	and primarily knowing him as ruminate now ask SFO to weigh
9900700	9903500	in on Trump's legal argument today that he's entitled to
9903500	9904800	absolute legal immunity.
9905000	9907300	Even if he murders a political rival.
9907800	9908700	That's ridiculous.
9908700	9910900	Obviously, what is your favorite TV show?
9911500	9912900	Have you seen the memes by the way?
9912900	9917900	I saw this guy make an AI generation of Biden a seal team
9917900	9920200	six assassinating a dude like shooting a gun.
9921100	9922400	Yeah, so I think I saw the meme.
9922400	9925700	Yeah, it was hilarious, right?
9925800	9930300	Because that's the that's the kind of that's where that
9930300	9935100	leads right if you think it's okay for a political person
9935300	9938700	to kill their political rivals or order a hit on that.
9939900	9941700	That's that's what's going to happen, right?
9941700	9943300	And I it's not a world.
9943300	9946000	I want to live in so it looks like roommate you're doing
9946000	9950000	like the the daily, you know political take you know, not
9950000	9953500	I'm not comparing you to this person because for any moral
9953500	9956000	reason it's just a similar type of content like like the
9956000	9959200	quartering right where you put out a video or like two videos
9959200	9962100	a day and you just like kind of flood the algorithm with
9962100	9964100	daily content and it's working out for you.
9964100	9964700	Good job, man.
9964900	9965800	I'm looking at your channel now.
9966900	9969800	Yeah, like yeah, he's a small video.
9969800	9970700	S is small video.
9970700	9972100	S is there like a definitely way to go?
9972100	9974200	I was doing it for a while and I got too fucking lazy.
9975400	9977000	I've been too lazy recently, right?
9977000	9982100	That's my problem is as I enjoy doing this because I get
9982100	9986300	to interact in a long form with people and to to send that
9986300	9988500	like 10 minutes snippets.
9988500	9988900	I don't know.
9990000	9994200	Yeah, well, I mean I did it for a while and I want to get
9994200	9995100	back to it.
9995100	9998400	I am 99% after watching destiny go through the meth stony
9998400	10001900	arc with with the the ADHD medication.
10002600	10007200	I am like knowing knowing my own my own issues.
10008000	10009600	I am like I'm very convinced.
10009600	10012200	I probably have some form of adult ADHD and I should probably
10012200	10014100	try out I should probably try out.
10014100	10015100	What do you got himself on?
10015300	10018000	Not simply like well, here's the thing where you see it a
10018000	10020900	lot and then suddenly you start having the symptoms because
10020900	10023800	that's all you ever looking at and seeing I've had this for
10023800	10024300	years, man.
10024300	10026200	I've been like this for years and years and years.
10026900	10027100	Yeah.
10027100	10028900	Yeah, the self-diagnosis.
10028900	10029700	Here's the thing, man.
10029900	10036200	It's um, I spent years and years fighting through it and
10036200	10039500	actually doing very well because like there were times where
10039800	10042000	you know, I would leave the internet for like three months
10042000	10043600	because something went down now.
10043600	10045800	I might have to take a day off of something bad goes down.
10045900	10049600	Right there are times when like I couldn't focus on anything
10049600	10050400	to get a video done.
10050400	10053500	Like it took me like two months to get a video out now.
10053500	10056700	I've been able to like hit spurts of one a day or one every
10056700	10059400	two days that last for a couple months and then I like relapse
10059400	10060600	back into old habits, right?
10060800	10064200	I definitely hyper focus on video games for like 16 hours
10064200	10068000	a day sometimes and also coffee gives me that very calming
10068000	10070100	effect when it makes most other people jittery.
10070700	10074500	What's the most recent video game you've binged out on?
10075000	10076100	Oh, Project Zomboid.
10076400	10077300	Really that good?
10078000	10078400	Yep.
10079700	10080300	That's really good.
10080300	10083500	I've been playing XCOM 2 and I've been busy.
10083500	10086100	I've been spending more time making all the little streamer
10086100	10090200	characters as the the people little XCOM agents, right and
10090200	10092300	making sure that they're decorated correctly and things
10092300	10092900	like that.
10092900	10095400	I don't know what that says about me as a gamer, but that's
10095400	10097700	been most of my experience and then I will play with them
10097700	10099200	and see who dies first etcetera.
10099900	10100600	Right, right, right.
10101800	10103500	You're trying to sing social contagion.
10103500	10104100	Here's the thing.
10104400	10107700	It's not social contagion because I've recognized this in
10107700	10109700	myself for over 10 years now.
10110300	10113200	I just haven't been able to fully put it together until I
10113200	10116000	watch Destiny go through like he had the same symptoms.
10116200	10119800	He went through a very similar process and it's and like
10120000	10122600	you can say like copycat stuff because it's like a streamer
10122600	10123400	you watch and they go.
10123400	10125700	Yeah, I understand that there's definitely some danger of
10125700	10129400	that but the fact that it that the symptoms he described
10129400	10130900	are so similar to similar to mine.
10131200	10133600	It's like maybe I and here's the thing you can go on for
10133600	10136000	medication for a month and then be like this ain't for me
10136000	10138000	and then stop, you know, you're going to stay on it forever.
10138000	10140700	You know guys like it's not one of those things.
10140700	10140900	Right?
10140900	10143800	So I'm going to go like it most medications.
10143800	10150300	Yeah, I might give it a go and just see like if after a month
10150300	10153600	like there's also some reports of people who go on ADHD meds
10153600	10157000	and they they report like losing all their creativity.
10157000	10157800	I wouldn't want that to happen.
10158000	10158200	Right?
10158200	10159500	So if that happens, I'll stop taking it.
10159500	10160400	It's like, you know, it's pretty easy.
10160800	10161400	Um, okay.
10161500	10164100	To answer the actual question though, uh, Trump's legal
10164100	10166300	argument today that he's entitled to absolute legal immunity.
10166300	10167600	You know, he mirrors a political rival.
10167700	10168600	Like that's fucking insane.
10168600	10172200	Obviously there's no fucking, even if like, because of the
10172200	10175100	way that some old law is written or something that's never
10175100	10176100	going to hold up in court.
10176200	10177500	Like that's, that's ridiculous.
10177500	10177700	Right?
10178200	10182100	Um, my favorite TV show, honestly, even though it's an
10182100	10183400	anime, probably attack on Titan.
10184500	10187200	Because I really like, I really liked it.
10187200	10190000	I haven't, I haven't, honestly, it doesn't get good until
10190000	10192700	season two and then it gets exponentially good every season
10192700	10193800	through two, three, and four.
10193900	10197000	This is, is it on crunchy roll or whatever off the, yeah,
10197100	10197600	yeah, it is.
10197800	10198500	I'm pretty sure it is.
10198600	10200300	Um, five more dollars from common cure.
10200600	10203800	Um, again, I'm prioritizing since we're coming to the end.
10203800	10204900	I'm prioritizing money.
10205300	10209200	Uh, so if you pay me five dollars to say dev, please
10209200	10210600	explain your thoughts on small towns.
10210600	10212700	You were shitting on them the other day and I was wondering
10212700	10214200	if you thought there was any hope for them.
10215400	10215800	Okay.
10215800	10219100	So what he means when he says that I was shitting on them
10219100	10221900	the other day is I put out this tweet.
10221900	10223100	Let's see if I can find it real quick.
10223100	10226200	I'll do like a quick search of town or towns.
10226700	10226800	Yeah.
10226800	10227100	Okay.
10227100	10230700	So I said that, uh, I grew up in a small town.
10231000	10232200	Everyone was in your business.
10232200	10233300	There was no privacy.
10233300	10234200	There's no privacy.
10234500	10236200	Infrastructure rollout was slow.
10236600	10239200	People move away like crazy due to lack of opportunity.
10239400	10240900	Small businesses regularly die.
10241200	10242200	Drugs are rampant.
10242500	10244700	And my small town is now a ghost town.
10245000	10248400	Uh, the towns, one large employer finally pulled out, leaving everybody
10248400	10252400	who stayed behind out of jobs, alcohol, alcoholism, and drug use is
10252400	10254600	skyrocketing be on it's already high rates.
10255000	10256100	The place was on its deathbed.
10256100	10259200	Even before that though, there's no future in small towns.
10259300	10262400	That was my take basically because of my experience growing up in one,
10262400	10264800	you know, I moved away to the city because there was nothing for me there.
10265000	10268300	And like half of my, half of my graduating class in high school moved
10268300	10271400	away to some city somewhere in Canada, where it's a Toronto or Vancouver
10271400	10273900	or, or Montreal or Ottawa or wherever.
10273900	10274100	Right.
10274100	10275700	They moved to some city and sort of died.
10276400	10280000	Um, and then the half of them stayed behind and the half that stayed
10280000	10282400	behind the half of that half.
10283200	10285800	Like they're now druggies and they've like lost their kids.
10285800	10286800	I have them all on Facebook.
10286800	10288700	So I'm like keeping track of the old drama back there.
10289000	10292000	Half of the half of the half that stayed behind are addicted
10292000	10293000	to drugs or alcohol.
10293200	10294600	A lot of them have lost their kids.
10294800	10299600	There's like public fights breaking out and people like it's just trashy stuff.
10300200	10302900	And then the remaining half that actually did have steady jobs and
10302900	10304500	were doing okay for themselves.
10304700	10307900	Well, the town's one employer just pulled out and now there's no jobs
10307900	10309100	and everyone lost their jobs.
10309100	10313700	And it's like, you know, I understand that there's the, like the right wing
10313700	10317600	has this very nostalgic view of whatever, like a, you know, the peaceful small
10317600	10321300	town where everything's a little bit slower and everyone's friendly.
10321600	10325200	That might be true some places, but in my experience, it's not true.
10325400	10328400	In my experience, small towns are just places of despair.
10328500	10330700	I grew up as a military brat, right?
10330700	10333800	So I don't have no experience with city versus small town.
10333800	10336400	I was always on a military base of some sort, right?
10336400	10340800	Growing up for most of my, my childhood, um, since I have grown
10340800	10344700	up, however, and have lived on my own, I'm now 40 fucking years old.
10344900	10349200	I have lived both in the city and I have lived in very, very small
10349200	10350400	communities, right?
10351200	10356600	My preference is to live in the small community and visit the city, but
10356600	10361300	that's a, that's something where I've already, I have, I have, I have
10361300	10364200	a job outside of my local area, right?
10364400	10366900	So, um, Doing streaming.
10366900	10369500	I can do that from the city where I can do that from the small town.
10369600	10373100	I prefer doing it from the small town because less people bother me.
10373500	10377100	Um, I like the feeling of, of being kind of away from it all.
10377300	10381500	And if I need social interaction, which I do on occasion, I'll drive
10381500	10382700	in and I'll slum it in the city.
10383500	10384100	Oh, that's fine.
10384100	10384300	Yep.
10384700	10384900	Yep.
10385400	10389600	I mean, I live like 10 minutes from downtown where I am and I am actually
10389600	10393400	moving cities in the spring and where I'll be moving is about a half
10393400	10394700	an hour from outside of downtown.
10394700	10397100	So like it's, I'm still like in the city.
10397400	10399800	I can still access all the amenities of the city, but it's like a
10399800	10401400	quieter part of it, you know?
10401900	10403300	So, yeah.
10404200	10404400	Cool.
10404800	10406000	Uh, five more dollars for fun.
10406000	10407600	Do is Wicca tactics gamer.
10407600	10409900	Also, please watch Freerun beyond journey's end.
10410500	10411200	That's an anime.
10411200	10411700	That's an anime.
10412800	10413100	Okay.
10413400	10417300	The current elf waifu who has the silver hair and the smug face.
10417300	10419400	That's from the one that's on Twitter everywhere right now.
10419600	10420700	That's Freerun beyond journey.
10420700	10422400	I don't follow the same people you do.
10422400	10425800	I don't see it unless it's a, you tweet, uh, I'll make sure to
10425800	10426200	retweet them.
10426200	10426900	Oh, well, thank you.
10427200	10430800	Uh, five more dollars from Artemus Fowls say object to the
10430800	10433300	characterization of the immunity argument and the stupid phrasing
10433700	10437300	used by the Donator and Dev and five more dollars from Artemus
10437300	10437700	Fowl.
10437800	10440100	There's nothing to argue the immunity arguments made by the
10440100	10442500	Donator and Dev did not take place at this point.
10443200	10444000	So here's the thing.
10444300	10447000	I've been, I know that this was, this is related to pondering
10447000	10447600	politics.
10447900	10452000	I've been arguing with Artemus in private now over the Jan six
10452000	10452500	stuff.
10453100	10455000	And I was like, Artemus, listen, you've been sending me all this
10455000	10457400	evidence out, believe your evidence after examining it, but
10457400	10459100	you like he, okay.
10459200	10461700	I've seen Destiny talked to like Aidan Paladin who walked in
10461700	10462900	with nothing and got destroyed.
10463000	10463400	All right.
10463700	10466700	I saw Destiny talk to Rob Knorr who did better than Aidan
10466700	10468300	Paladin, but still got destroyed.
10468600	10474100	But, um, Artemus is unironically presenting to me more evidence
10474500	10479600	of the Trump side of the January 6th and election conversations
10479900	10481800	than I've seen from anybody before.
10482100	10482600	All right.
10482900	10486000	So I do think that speaking to Artemus about this topic is
10486000	10486600	worthwhile.
10486900	10489500	I still think he's, I think he's, I think Artemus is
10489500	10492600	fundamentally wrong about them, but he's, he's like, he's
10492600	10494700	actually bringing evidence that I haven't seen anyone talk
10494700	10495600	about before, which is interesting.
10496200	10496400	Yeah.
10496400	10498400	So like, that's why I've said like, Hey, listen, Artemus
10498500	10500800	probably should talk to Brianna Wu at some point.
10501100	10503800	Artemus probably should talk to pondering politics at some
10503800	10504100	point.
10504400	10506900	I tried to set up Artemus versus Destiny, but artists wouldn't
10506900	10507300	do it.
10508100	10509500	Artemus, what are you doing?
10509600	10512100	Come on, come on.
10512700	10515200	Look, you're, you're a reasonable guy.
10515400	10516400	You're a rational guy.
10516700	10518600	You're a civil guy.
10519300	10521600	We need more of that in this space, less screaming
10521600	10524400	autistically and more civil reasonable.
10524500	10527000	Here's evidence and we can argue over the evidence.
10527300	10528200	That would be great.
10528500	10530700	And pondering politics is down for it, right?
10531000	10533000	We could do a pondering politics versus the world thing
10533000	10533600	if you want.
10533600	10537000	Like, do you want to do, do you want to do Artemus fallow
10537000	10538300	versus pondering politics?
10538300	10538900	That'd be interesting.
10538900	10543200	Yes, because so, so I pondering politics, I don't know if
10543200	10543600	you heard me.
10543600	10544900	I'll just repeat it very quickly.
10545800	10550300	Artemus of the people who are on the pro-Trump side of January
10550300	10551800	26th and the 2020 election.
10552200	10555500	Artemus is probably the most reasonable person I've seen
10555900	10559000	more so than anyone that Destiny's debated on his channel
10559200	10561200	or that usually do these sorts of debates.
10561500	10564000	Artemus does seem to be the most reasonable person of that
10564000	10566900	side, even though I think he's wrong.
10567400	10570900	Still he has better arguments and he brings up more evidence
10570900	10571700	than any of them.
10571700	10574600	And this is to you Dev and I can set up this up with you.
10574600	10578300	But if I think that to add to that and I'm not sure where
10578300	10582500	I'd rate them, but are you familiar with a streamer small
10583600	10585200	libertarian streamer named Lactoid?
10586200	10590800	No, no, he's another he's a practicing lawyer, right and
10590800	10592500	he has a very good grasp.
10592500	10595700	We did a discussion on last year.
10595700	10599500	I said as long time ago at the end of December with Pisco
10599700	10604500	pondering politics Lactoid and a couple others about the Trump
10604700	10608100	removing the Trump from the ballot in Colorado, right?
10608800	10609900	He brings facts.
10609900	10610800	He brings figures.
10611900	10613500	He's a pretty reasonable guy.
10613500	10616600	So you might enjoy if you enjoy Artemis Fowl, you might enjoy
10616600	10617100	him too.
10617200	10619700	Not to say you're not you're not a great guy.
10619700	10621300	Artemus Fowl, we like you, Artemus Fowl.
10621300	10622700	I just want to broaden our heart.
10623700	10624500	Here's the thing, right?
10624500	10626600	Like I do not know much.
10626600	10629100	I mean, I know some of American law, but I'm not I'm no expert,
10629100	10633500	right? My wheelhouse has always been political theory and
10633500	10636200	to a lesser extent history and then of course video games,
10636200	10636500	right?
10636500	10637700	That's unrelated to politics.
10638000	10639900	But political theory and history is my thing.
10639900	10642900	Like I can sit here and tell you the entire life story of
10642900	10643600	Antonio Graham.
10643600	10644700	She off the top of my head.
10645000	10647900	I cannot tell you whether or not any of these indictments
10647900	10651400	are 100% going to go for Trump or not, you know, like I
10651400	10653800	can tell an arm is found even when he calls them like I'm
10653800	10654400	not a lawyer.
10654400	10655600	I can't argue these.
10655600	10656800	I don't know, right?
10656800	10659300	I just don't know and I'm not going to pretend I do.
10661000	10662900	Artemis Fowl another five dollars.
10662900	10665700	I will inevitably be sided with by the courts and why destiny
10665700	10668700	will be mad and blame the Supreme the corrupt quote-unquote
10668700	10672900	Supreme Court think so so because here's the thing like
10672900	10673900	there's here.
10674000	10677800	Let's say that the best possible scenario is that the Georgia
10677800	10680900	Rico case completely falls apart because of what Artemis
10680900	10682800	Fowl presented at the start of the stream, right?
10682800	10686400	The the person appoints the his her boyfriend and it was
10686400	10689200	improper and something actually comes out of the meetings
10689200	10691600	with with Biden and like let's say that everything falls
10691600	10692300	apart, right?
10692400	10695500	So the Georgia Rico case is now out isn't there still
10695500	10697600	three more indictments against Trump?
10698200	10700600	I'm pretty sure there's at least three more and the documents
10700600	10704300	one looks like the documents one appears to be ironclad
10704300	10705100	against Trump.
10705300	10710000	So I'm just sitting here thinking like even if even if Georgia
10710000	10713300	Rico falls apart because of what Artemis presented earlier,
10713500	10715500	like that's only one angle of attack against Trump right
10715500	10719100	now. Yeah, but the classified documents case has the most
10719100	10721000	favorable judge a lean cannon.
10721000	10723800	So it's entirely possible between that and a favorable jury
10723800	10726200	pulled it even though they have the debt to rights on the
10726200	10729100	case during nullification to get in the day.
10729900	10730500	Well, I think so.
10730500	10732800	Well, hello, Josiah Potter in politics.
10733900	10735200	You're going to be a last caller by the way.
10736200	10737300	Hey, wait.
10737300	10737800	No art.
10737800	10738800	Artemis is in the chat there.
10738800	10739300	Bring him in.
10740000	10743000	We'll do it right now with right now.
10743700	10744400	Hi Artemis.
10746200	10747100	What's going on?
10747800	10748900	Hey, dude, what's up?
10749600	10750600	Oh, just hanging out.
10751500	10753700	Also, you're in the room.
10753700	10756900	Same room Josiah meet Artemis Artemis.
10757200	10758600	Hey, we talked we talked before.
10758600	10759200	What's up, buddy?
10759600	10761600	But have you guys really actually on my show?
10761600	10763000	Yes, I believe.
10763000	10764400	Oh, oh neat.
10764700	10769200	Oh, is this the the guy that said that the the crew people
10769200	10772100	that brought the Colorado case were nonpartisan?
10773500	10775200	That they are a non-profit.
10775700	10777500	Yeah, that was that was not correct.
10778200	10779800	They no, no, no, no, no, no.
10779800	10782700	Well that they are a non-profit but they were the argument
10782700	10783700	was that they were partisan.
10783800	10784900	Now that they were nonprofit.
10784900	10785400	They okay.
10785400	10788500	So you were the guy who said the Democrats brought the case
10788500	10789200	even though it was right.
10789200	10789800	It was media.
10789900	10793300	It was Republican and Independent voters who by the way
10793300	10796700	are famously not Democrat Republicans are that the one the
10796700	10799900	one Republican voter that seems to be voting in every state
10799900	10803400	somehow and is bringing the case by a company owned by media
10803400	10803900	matters.
10804300	10804800	I don't know.
10804800	10805600	So, okay.
10805600	10807400	He's not they're not the party to the case.
10807400	10808300	It's the Republican.
10808300	10811900	They found they found they found a guy that would push it.
10811900	10812300	Yes.
10812400	10812600	Yes.
10812600	10813100	Thank you.
10813500	10816900	Case on the part on behalf of Republicans and Independents.
10817500	10819500	We want to frame this as a strictly partisan issue.
10819500	10820500	It is a partisan issue.
10820500	10821100	Everybody can see it.
10821100	10822700	That's why it's being thrown out everywhere else.
10822700	10823100	Wait a minute.
10823100	10825600	So it's a partisan issue when Republicans and Independents
10825600	10829400	bring the case when media matters when media matters shops
10829400	10832600	around and finds one guy that's willing to be it doesn't matter
10832600	10833200	that they shop.
10833200	10836300	It doesn't matter that they shop around Republican voters
10836500	10839800	and Independent voters brought the case by definition you
10839800	10841700	keep saying Republican voters.
10841700	10843300	They literally found so okay.
10843300	10844000	I should clear this up.
10844000	10844700	I should clear this up.
10844700	10848200	So Republicans are the people who vote typically for Trump.
10848200	10850100	Okay Democrats are a different party.
10851800	10852800	Okay, come on guys.
10852800	10855100	You could you could do whatever you want say that but everybody
10855100	10858200	I understand I know I have all these other state rulings.
10858400	10861800	So Donald Trump is a Republican if that helps.
10861800	10862900	He's not a Democrat.
10863200	10864700	He's not even a Republican at this point.
10864700	10866700	I don't I don't even know what he is a Republican.
10867500	10869100	So you struggle with words.
10869100	10869900	It seems to me.
10869900	10872700	I think I think why is it becoming personal?
10874800	10875300	He lied.
10875300	10878600	He lied to people on fucking this guy's lying right now saying
10878600	10881900	that they were not a Republican even though he's running as
10881900	10883300	the Republican candidate.
10883300	10886400	He was the Republican is Bernie Sanders a Democrat and in 20
10886400	10889500	no, he's a registered Independent who caucuses with Democrats
10890300	10894200	weird, so is Donald Trump is Donald Trump an independent
10894200	10898900	or a Republican I would say Republican I would say he runs
10898900	10901900	in the Republican hold on.
10901900	10906100	Hey, hold on.
10906100	10906500	Hold on.
10906600	10906900	Hold on.
10906900	10910000	He's doing Hassan pikers bullshit of arguing some tangents.
10910000	10914100	Is this on pikers bullshit using like facts logic and definition.
10914600	10915800	No, it's definitely not.
10915800	10916500	It is definitely.
10916500	10921400	Well, hold on like you guys guys can I jump in here?
10921900	10925500	Let's have maybe be a be the the centrist that he was born
10925500	10926200	with the centrist.
10926200	10931400	Okay, I mean, it's very clear that Donald Trump is a part
10931400	10932500	of the Republican Party.
10932500	10935100	However, it's also very clear that he has no I'm sorry.
10936500	10938400	He finished me finish you tell that I just want I just want
10938400	10940300	I already missed that.
10940800	10944600	However, it's also very clear that Donald Trump has no real
10944600	10945800	allegiance to it.
10945900	10948000	And if it served his purposes, he would leave it.
10948400	10948800	Correct.
10948800	10952200	So so what are we probably what Artemis Fowl should have
10952200	10955500	said is that Donald Trump is not conservative and he's not
10955500	10956100	conservative.
10956100	10956700	I would agree.
10956700	10961000	But he is a Republican a Republican is part of a political
10961000	10964100	party. Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican.
10964100	10965000	I understand.
10965000	10968100	This is Hassan Parker fucking thing to do in an argument
10968100	10968800	Artemis Fowl.
10968800	10974000	I'm going to tell you genius and you're an adult idiot.
10974900	10980900	Okay, we're going to do this.
10980900	10981800	We're going to do this.
10983300	10985100	Both of you stop both of you stop.
10985200	10989400	I mean, I would love to have this as an actual kind of back
10989400	10989900	and forth.
10990100	10992900	I don't think that now is the best time for it when we're
10992900	10997900	closing down because we're about to get a whole lot of I need
10997900	11000200	to say something because you told me I could after I waited
11000200	11000700	for death.
11001600	11002600	Well, okay, sure.
11002600	11003100	Go ahead.
11003100	11004900	But then I'm going to say as well.
11004900	11007200	So there was a statement at the end of a stream about the
11007200	11010300	Colorado Supreme Court decision and that it was brought by
11010300	11013800	a nonpartisan organization and that was claimed here on the
11013800	11014700	stream to you.
11014700	11015700	What was the organization?
11016200	11019500	It was Cruz something or responsibility and ethics in Washington.
11019500	11021900	So I would watch dog.
11022000	11022200	Yeah.
11022200	11022400	Yeah.
11022400	11023900	And there are they actually nonpartisan?
11024200	11028600	No, they well, well, they they are actually they are led by
11028600	11029900	a Bush-era Republican.
11029900	11032400	He can he struggles with the word, but a Republican is not
11032400	11035700	a Democrat and they go after Democratic corruption to there
11035700	11038300	just happens to be more corruption on the Republican side
11038300	11042600	and this was this was this was the the bot and Bailey site
11043200	11045000	mountain Bailey, there we go.
11046000	11049500	So after looking into it and looking at all of the receipts
11049500	11052600	and everything for it media media matters actually owns
11052600	11055600	crew. They actually have they they're in the same building
11055800	11058400	ran by have multiple people that in the same organizations
11058400	11061400	working in in different parts of each.
11061900	11063500	It is it is.
11065100	11067400	So it is not a nonpartisan organization.
11067400	11068700	It is ran by media matters.
11068700	11070200	It gets funded by Democratic.
11070900	11071500	What do you call it?
11072700	11073700	Donor dark money.
11073700	11076000	Yeah, dark blue stuff.
11076000	11076400	Basically.
11076400	11076700	Yes.
11077200	11077700	Yes.
11077700	11079300	So it's not a nonpartisan group.
11079300	11080900	I don't know why people keep claiming that just because
11080900	11084200	there's a Republican in it instead of just covers a Republican.
11084200	11084900	What is the name of it again?
11084900	11086000	I'm looking at real.
11086000	11086500	What's the name of it?
11087300	11090800	This is for responsibility and ethics in Washington.
11091300	11094500	Okay, I had a big issue with this because I don't like
11094500	11099100	when people try to couch obviously partisan hackery behind
11099100	11103400	a veneer of non-partisanship that was my I understand
11103400	11105800	I understand so he takes issue with the fact that it's
11105800	11108500	led by a Republican and cases in question have been brought
11108500	11112100	by Republican and independent voters, but because he's
11112100	11112900	a MAGA cultist.
11112900	11114000	He can't cope with that.
11114700	11116700	Listen, it's all it's all partisan.
11117000	11118400	Well, then you never voted for trouble.
11118400	11122000	Then you shouldn't have a problem reconciling this organization
11122000	11125800	is an organization goes after corruption including Democratic
11125800	11127900	corruption. You see what they have to say about Senator
11127900	11130600	Bob Menendez and elected Democratic senator.
11131100	11134500	They're led by a Republican and if the cases in question
11134500	11137300	are brought by Republican and independent voters, then
11137300	11141600	it's probably fair to say it's nonpartisan just because
11141600	11142800	it's against Trump.
11142800	11147200	Maybe maybe there's actually a valid case against Trump.
11147200	11148600	Now, we're going to hold on a second.
11148700	11153800	We're going to look at that go go ahead the donors to crew
11153800	11157400	include such groups as Democracy Alliance, which is a network
11157400	11160800	of progressive mega donors service Employees International
11160800	11164800	Union, which is a union in Canada the United States featuring
11164900	11168300	service workers or representing service workers the ARCA Foundation
11168300	11172000	which is a progressive American philanthropic Foundation
11173100	11177000	and the Gill Foundation, which is an LGBT Foundation.
11177000	11180100	I mean, even if founded by a Republican it does seem to
11180100	11182100	be funded primarily by left-leaning sources.
11182100	11184500	It is it is not a nonpartisan organization.
11184500	11185400	This is just a fuck.
11185400	11188500	So what do you so what is nonpartisan?
11188800	11190700	It is let's clear it up.
11191000	11191500	Let's go ahead.
11191500	11196700	It is a or is media matters a nonpartisan organization.
11196700	11198000	What does nonpartisan me?
11198000	11202100	Hold on because maybe we have a lot of you what okay to
11202100	11202900	rephrase the question.
11202900	11206600	Can you give us an example Artemis of a nonpartisan organization
11206600	11207300	in your opinion?
11207400	11208300	What would you go?
11208800	11209400	Jesus.
11209500	11210200	Let's see.
11212300	11217600	The DMV DMV is a government agency.
11217600	11222000	What about a political organization clarify a political
11222000	11223000	organization?
11224500	11226000	Fire would be one.
11226300	11227400	I'll give them that one.
11228400	11229800	I heard of that the fire.org.
11229800	11233600	It's a free speech free speech organization Foundation of
11233600	11235000	individual rights and expression.
11235900	11237000	It takes.
11237100	11239000	Oh, yes left right and center though.
11239000	11242000	A lot of people have accused them of being right-leaning
11242000	11246300	because some of their donors are from the right some of them.
11246300	11246700	Okay.
11246800	11250300	Do you have another one SPJ the Society of professional
11250300	11251800	journalists would probably another one.
11253200	11253500	All right.
11253500	11256500	So here's my question if we go through this in real time.
11256500	11261300	Can we find examples of allegations where or credible evidence
11261300	11265200	where the nonpartisan groups that you list skew towards a
11265200	11269700	particular political affiliation because here's my point.
11269700	11271200	I want to be very clear about this.
11271500	11275800	I do not mean to suggest that Cruz output is neutral in the
11275800	11279600	sense that for every Republican complaint, they have a Democrat
11279600	11283200	complaint want to be very clear about that it go after Republicans
11283200	11284300	more than Democrats.
11284300	11287300	The reason I call them nonpartisan is that they will go after
11287300	11290200	Democrats when they think Democrats are guilty of corruption.
11290200	11292200	Bob Menendez is a great example.
11292700	11295000	I think you're struggling to deal with in my opinion.
11295000	11297800	Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you have good examples to the contrary
11298100	11300900	is that right now there tends to be more corruption within
11300900	11304300	the Republican Party than there does the Democratic Party,
11304300	11307900	which is why you don't see what do you have evidence for
11307900	11308400	that claim?
11308400	11314600	I can give you examples like so no evidence like numbers like
11314600	11316100	I don't need fucking anecdotes.
11316100	11319100	Why do you keep saying that you're you're giving me anecdotes
11319100	11320700	when you talk about the partisanship?
11320700	11322800	You're like, no, no, no, I don't think they're I don't think
11322800	11323900	they're nonpartisan.
11323900	11328000	They skew too much towards the left and then the examples
11328000	11331000	that some of the examples that you just provided apparently
11331100	11333400	the perception is they skew to the right.
11333600	11337600	I don't have hard data to how would how would I compute that?
11337800	11338400	I'm confused.
11338700	11341800	Well, first of all, I'm going to be a wick partisan jmac.
11341800	11344900	Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships really appreciate
11344900	11349100	you. Congratulations to all those who get those memberships
11349100	11350900	anyway, I'm confused.
11350900	11356200	Is it media matters the organization that try to get all
11356200	11361400	of the was it the stuff pulled from X by intentionally fucking
11361400	11365900	with the algorithm to put advertising next to Nazi tweets
11366500	11366700	also?
11366700	11367500	Hey jmac.
11367700	11370100	What can you jmac is the answer is yes.
11370100	11373600	I don't know who he is individually, but I know he comes
11373600	11377900	around sometimes and says hi jmac is the Adam and sitch mega
11377900	11378500	whale.
11378600	11382000	Oh the mega whale the Adam and sitch mega whale won't look
11382000	11384200	throw some of that whale action my way buddy.
11384300	11385100	Thank you for being here.
11385100	11387500	Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships really appreciate
11387500	11389100	you. Yeah, jmac.
11389100	11390600	I was dreaming tomorrow.
11390600	11391200	Join me.
11391200	11398100	Jamie medium letters backs crew makes me partisan.
11400400	11400900	Hmm.
11401200	11402800	I would say no.
11402800	11406200	I would say you won't let him answer let him answer like
11406200	11407100	because you asked him a question.
11408100	11408800	He asked.
11408900	11409200	Okay.
11409200	11410900	Well, you can ask the full thing, but I think you got the
11410900	11411400	point across.
11411400	11414400	He's asking if something is sponsored by something.
11414600	11416800	Does that make it innately partisan?
11417800	11421600	But the fact is is that media matters and crew both have
11421600	11425700	multiple people from both that work in both companies and
11425700	11429100	I'll put the lawyers are pushed the media matters lawyers
11429100	11430500	are in the crew case.
11431300	11433500	You can since you talked about evidence.
11433500	11434700	Can you send me that link?
11435200	11437100	Yeah, let me actually shit.
11437100	11437300	Rick.
11437300	11438400	Do you still have that?
11439300	11441800	So I said to you ready 20 links dude.
11441800	11443200	I probably do.
11444000	11445700	I could help probably there.
11445700	11446800	I'd have to look for it.
11446800	11452100	So so the socialist answer to this is that as long as money
11452100	11455000	is changing hands, they're inherently corrupt and it's eternal
11455200	11459200	and that's just how it is and that nothing everything is
11459200	11459700	political.
11459700	11461400	Nothing can truly be nonpartisan.
11461700	11464200	And listen, I'm I'm fine.
11464300	11465800	I'm fine with that.
11465800	11468900	I'll if that's your definition of what a nonpartisan is.
11468900	11471700	I'm fine with it's very strict, but I'm fine with the reason
11471700	11474800	I said they're nonpartisan is because they will go after
11474800	11477100	instances of Democratic corruption as well.
11477100	11480300	I use Bob Menendez as a great recent example.
11480500	11482100	That's why I said they're nonpartisan.
11482300	11486800	I don't and I also like the concept of they get one off
11487300	11490300	like one one Democrat for every thousand Republicans or
11490300	11492800	whatever. That's that what is that what the ratio is?
11492800	11496600	I have no idea but the like I've seen media matters do this.
11497200	11498000	Wait, what is that?
11498000	11498800	What is the ratio?
11498800	11499800	That's media matters.
11499800	11500700	I'm five percent.
11500700	11503000	I don't know the ratio be clear, but it's a ratio is like
11503000	11506700	big 55% of the people that get got by them are Republicans
11506700	11508100	and 45% are Democrats.
11508100	11512800	Does that is that close enough to suggest non-partisanship
11512800	11514400	to you or is it too much?
11514700	11517500	I think anything like 70 30 would be fine.
11517500	11522400	Like I don't really yeah, so I don't have a breakdown of
11522400	11523000	the cases.
11523000	11526200	I don't all I know is that yes, they go after Republicans
11526200	11528800	more but they have gone after Democrats as well.
11529200	11532000	They are or were led by a George W.
11532000	11537100	Bush former employee a bush-era Republican and our media
11537100	11539400	matters. That's a different organization.
11539400	11541700	If you want to make allegations about media matters,
11541700	11542500	I'm fine with that.
11542500	11545100	I'm not nearly as conversant on media matters and they're
11545100	11548700	not party to the lawsuit as far as the lawsuits are concerned.
11548700	11551400	The reason that I made a big deal about of this if I remember
11551400	11554300	our first conversation is because the lawsuits are being
11554300	11556700	brought by Republican and independent voters.
11557500	11563100	I found something I found something as relevant.
11563100	11565500	Okay, so right on the Wikipedia page.
11566700	11571500	Basically from 2005 and 2014 their annual reports named
11571700	11577300	25 corrupt Democrats and 63 corrupt Republicans, so that
11577300	11581500	would be 28% Democratic and then whatever the other amount
11581500	11583200	is. When did media matters by?
11584200	11584700	I don't know.
11584700	11587600	I see through you're going to find out that that number
11587600	11590800	is going to add line up pretty quick, but to kind of interrogate
11590800	11591400	you pondering.
11591400	11594600	I said both of them too, by the way ting great and interrogate
11594600	11597600	you pondering for the moment or under that definition of
11597600	11602800	going after the other side and as an astute wick chatter
11602800	11607300	pointed out would that make Fox News nonpartisan because
11607300	11610100	they sometimes will go after Republicans as well.
11611000	11616500	I would say that Fox News has a liberal or excuse me a
11616500	11619500	conservative bent, but this was my point when we go back
11619500	11625100	to nonpartisan as I said probably 15 minutes ago if if Artemis
11625100	11634500	wants to say that crew has a favorable is a favorable perception
11634500	11638100	of Democrats because they criticize Democrats less often.
11638100	11639200	I'm sympathetic to that.
11639200	11643600	I just think that I that to me doesn't contradict nonpartisan
11643600	11647600	unless you have an extremely strict view of what nonpartisan
11647600	11651500	is which is for every complaint you have against a Democrat
11651700	11655200	you have to bring one against a Republican and vice versa.
11655500	11660600	I do not contest that crew spends more time going after Republicans
11660600	11663400	than Democrats and never suggested otherwise.
11663600	11666000	The reason I said that they were nonpartisan is because they're
11666000	11669600	an anti-corruption watchdog group that will persistently
11669600	11673000	go after corruption even from Democrats.
11673000	11676200	They just don't go after Democrats as often I would argue
11676600	11679300	that's a function of Republicans just being more corrupt.
11682900	11686900	Yeah, I'm going to go with the it is obviously it's ran by
11686900	11687700	media matters.
11688600	11691700	It is looks like I can't find when they when they purchase
11691700	11692000	it though.
11692000	11693600	I can't find that it's 2015.
11694200	11702200	Yeah, there was a a article that came out saying look who
11702200	11705500	now owns it or whatever the fuck or lined with it.
11705500	11707100	I have to go find it again.
11707800	11709200	Okay, that sounds good.
11709200	11709900	I can find it.
11710200	11713700	No again, I'm fine with that but it was Republicans and
11713700	11715400	independents who brought the case.
11715400	11718000	It's not just liberals bringing this case.
11718000	11720200	I don't know why you think that that means anything they
11720200	11722200	found a fucking why wait.
11722200	11726000	Why why do I think that it matters that no, no, it doesn't
11726000	11729000	matter what case we're even are you even arguing about the
11729000	11732600	Colorado the Colorado removal of Trump from the ballot?
11732600	11736400	Yeah, so Artemis right Democrats in the left bringing this
11736400	11739700	stuff against Trump and my position is it's a bit more nuanced
11739700	11742600	than that because Republicans are the ones making the claims
11742600	11743200	important.
11743500	11745800	He says it doesn't matter because I got a crew is the one
11745800	11746400	backing them.
11746600	11749800	So I got a question for dev and wick.
11750300	11755600	Okay, so so if you can if a single person cannot sue for
11755600	11759000	fraud in the 2020 election individually as a voter, why
11759000	11761900	would they be able to sue in a primary to get somebody off
11761900	11762600	the ballot?
11763700	11765700	Because they would have no standing either way.
11765700	11767600	It doesn't seem like they should be able to answer that
11767600	11769100	question before you answer that question.
11769100	11770900	I'm sorry, can because it sounds like we're going on to a
11770900	11771500	different thing.
11771500	11773800	No, no, no, I was just like that just came into my head and
11773800	11776600	I was I wanted to get that out before I put there.
11776800	11780000	I mean, yeah, what I recall is that in 2020 some of the
11780000	11782100	lawsuits were thrown out for standing and the standing was
11782100	11785900	you can't have a random Joe just sue because it's like,
11785900	11786700	okay, that makes sense.
11786700	11788700	And if it is equivalent, then I guess it would make sense
11788700	11789200	here too.
11789300	11791700	Yeah, and the the answer is you can literally find a random
11791700	11796200	person as a as the front the front face to a lawsuit by a
11796400	11797300	large corporation.
11797300	11800100	That's why it doesn't matter who they find for this primary
11800400	11802400	issue is because they could literally just pay anybody to
11802400	11802800	do it.
11803700	11808200	I think so, but the court decided to hear the case the
11808200	11812800	correct which is the process of arguing it and writing out
11812800	11813900	their opinion.
11814300	11817300	What about the actual merits of the case?
11817500	11820500	Are you do you say because I thought at the end of the day,
11820500	11821300	this is the same problem.
11821300	11824400	I had when people were talking about the plagiarism things
11824400	11828100	like oh a Republican brought that so we have to ignore that
11828100	11830400	and Republican brought that to the forefront.
11830600	11831700	I don't give a shit.
11831900	11833300	Are the allegations true?
11834200	11836600	Does the case have merit or does it not?
11836600	11840200	I don't care about the message at the end of the day.
11840900	11844100	There's a mere ways with can we can we point out one thing
11844100	11846500	so that the crux of the disagreement least the one that
11846500	11849600	he brought to me in this conversation is he doesn't think
11849600	11850500	it matters.
11850600	11855600	It doesn't it basically this is not a this is still a scheme
11855600	11858900	by the left and the Democrats Republicans play no role in
11858900	11862600	this apparently no Republican challenges Donald Trump's
11862600	11865900	eligibility under section 3 of the 14th Amendment.
11865900	11870400	It is purely Democrats and the left because he says that
11870400	11873100	the fact that Republicans are filing a suit doesn't matter
11873100	11877000	when they've got a left-leaning nonprofit behind them.
11877000	11878600	Yeah, do you think it matters?
11878600	11880500	Well, first of all first of all Artemis.
11880500	11883000	Do you think that's a fair recounting of your position?
11884600	11888400	It's sort of because I can't remember what state Supreme
11888400	11890800	Court said it but they literally threw it out because
11890800	11893600	of this because it was obviously a bid just to get somebody
11893600	11894800	removed off the ballot.
11895800	11898400	But that's what it was and I'm trying to figure out which
11898400	11901000	state it said it in so I can use it is it Michigan?
11902400	11905100	Yeah, Michigan said that because they pointed out that
11905100	11907900	they are literally a partisan organization that pushed
11907900	11910800	this specifically because that's why we have the Supreme
11910800	11913900	Court to adjudicate and different court and that's where
11913900	11915600	it's going to go and that's why it's going to get struck
11915600	11917400	down because regardless of who took it up.
11917400	11919800	They never should have it's going to get wiped out.
11920000	11924000	So Wick my question to you is is it possible for Republicans
11924000	11926700	some Republicans in this country some conservatives in
11926700	11930400	this country to genuinely believe that Trump is ineligible
11930400	11931300	under the 14th.
11931300	11933400	I I know them right.
11933400	11934800	I know that that's the thing though.
11934800	11935500	I do like it.
11935500	11938900	The fact that both of you are asking me questions to snidely
11938900	11942900	well apparently apparently this is what do you think about
11942900	11945800	this and I'm going to frame my opponent's argument in the
11945800	11946500	worst way possible.
11946500	11947700	But no, I think it's fine.
11948600	11953700	So Artemis is there so he believes that there are people
11953700	11956700	in this country conservatives and Republicans who do genuinely
11956700	11960100	believe Donald Trump is disqualified under the 14th Amendment,
11960100	11961200	which is my position.
11961200	11962400	Do you agree or disagree?
11962500	11964200	I think there's probably people out there that do.
11964700	11967800	Okay, and I don't see at this point what the beef is.
11967800	11971100	I think that we have gotten as asymptotically close to consensus
11971100	11972700	over who's behind this.
11972700	11976100	I agree that certainly it would favor the Democrats this
11976100	11978900	particular outcome over the Republican Party in general.
11979100	11983300	My position is that these suits it does matter that Republican
11983300	11986400	voters are bringing the suit that I that it's not we don't
11986400	11989900	have no evidence that their feelings are insincere or that
11989900	11993700	it's just some sort of elaborate scheme brew probably has
11993700	11994800	motivated reasoning.
11994800	11996700	They think Donald Trump is corrupt.
11996700	11999300	They probably also think he is ineligible under the 14th
11999300	12002400	Amendment and there are Republican and independent voters
12002400	12003500	who feel likewise.
12003700	12004700	I think that matters.
12005000	12007800	Let me hear let me let me give you a olive branch, right?
12008000	12012600	If a organization that was without actually like actually
12012600	12016600	nonpartisan and didn't really have any backing from a obviously
12016600	12020600	partisan source brought this case and succeeded it would
12020600	12022000	have a lot more way behind it.
12022600	12027100	The problem is is that they chose a an organization that
12027100	12029800	was backed by Media Matters because it's ran by Media Matters
12030000	12033600	the people from Media Matters in the organization is caused
12033600	12036300	doubt to be produced in this court case.
12036600	12038200	And that is the issue you're going to run.
12038200	12041500	You're going to see this come into the Supreme Court case
12041500	12044500	is that it's going to be pointed out but here the Artemis
12044700	12050600	like I don't think I cannot think of a scenario where it
12050600	12054400	wouldn't cause a sizable portion of the Republican Party
12054400	12057400	to doubt the merits of it just simply based on the accusation.
12057500	12061100	I cannot think of any organization that brought this forward
12061100	12062800	like even if Liz Cheney, right?
12062800	12065700	Remember when Liz Cheney and all those Republicans voted
12065700	12069000	to impeach Trump and immediately they were decided all these
12069000	12070000	are Republicans.
12070100	12074500	So what if a person just hired an attorney from a regular
12074500	12076900	like lawyer's office and then did this?
12079000	12082000	Yeah, I think that people would just be like like people
12082000	12084400	would find there's no there's no can well meet they would
12084400	12085400	they would struggle.
12085900	12088000	It would be wouldn't be nearly as easy.
12089600	12090700	It'd be really fucking hard.
12090700	12091700	I don't know if that's true.
12091900	12093900	I'm not I'm not sure what you yeah, I'm not sure what you
12093900	12097200	mean there out of curiosity since with brought up Liz Cheney
12098600	12102300	Liz Cheney recently came out and admitted or confirmed.
12102600	12104700	She thinks that Trump is disqualified under section 3
12104700	12105700	of the 14th Amendment.
12105700	12106300	Do you agree?
12106500	12109600	Like do you think that she's a you think that her beliefs
12109600	12110300	are sincere?
12110500	12111800	No, well hold on.
12111900	12114500	I believe that she sincerely hates the man and probably
12114600	12116900	think so look she would believe it.
12117400	12118700	I don't doubt her beliefs.
12118900	12120600	I mean he shit all over her father.
12121000	12122400	She has every reason to hate him.
12122900	12125000	So it would probably be colored in that way.
12125500	12127600	You think it's possible that she let's say she hates him
12127600	12130400	you think it's possible it's because of his actions not
12130400	12132600	because he insulted her father.
12134800	12137600	I there's no way to tell that that would be a mens rea
12137600	12140600	thing and I will you just speculate it as to her men's
12140800	12142700	rail. No, no, she definitely hates him.
12143600	12146400	She she sacrificed her seat as a hold on.
12146400	12150500	She sacrificed her seat as a congressperson to destroy him
12150500	12153100	in the January 6th thing that she dedicated herself to
12153100	12156200	that. She said I am going to destroy him off the get him
12156200	12156800	off the ballot.
12157500	12160300	You were willing to speculate that the reason was because
12160300	12162600	he insulted Dick Cheney her father.
12162700	12165500	So you were happy to speculate that that was the reason
12165500	12166000	correct.
12166000	12170300	I'm asking you is it possible that maybe let me try it
12170300	12171800	conservative ahead.
12171800	12172700	Let me try it this way.
12173600	12174800	Someone joins the military.
12175400	12178400	They go off to the foreign country and they fight the war
12178700	12181700	and they kill a bunch of the enemy, right?
12183000	12185800	Do they do that because they love their country and want
12185800	12188700	to put their lives on the line and destroy its enemies or
12188700	12190900	are they doing that because they hate those people and
12190900	12192200	want to kill those people?
12193400	12196100	I think it's I think it's slightly different reasoning
12196100	12199900	because because Liz Cheney hated Trump before January 6th.
12200400	12201200	No, she did not.
12201300	12203300	She oh, she definitely fucking did.
12203300	12204600	I don't know where she didn't.
12205200	12208000	They are what do you think they are several indications
12208000	12210000	that she said you think it matters?
12210000	12211100	Do you think it matters?
12211100	12212100	Let me let me ask you this.
12213600	12218200	How a congressperson Haves or how they vote.
12218200	12221200	Do you think these are reflections of support or opposition?
12223800	12225100	Vice can you say that again?
12225800	12229200	Do you think how a congressperson any congressperson Democrat
12229200	12229900	Republican?
12229900	12234100	It doesn't matter how they behave who they support and
12234100	12235000	how they vote.
12235000	12236200	Do you think these things matter?
12237800	12244200	Yes, for the most part you voted with Donald Trump 93% of
12244200	12247500	the time higher than Jim Jordan higher than Mike Johnson.
12247900	12249400	She put her money where her mouth was.
12249400	12251000	She voted for him in 2016.
12251000	12254200	She voted for him in 2020 and when she served in Congress
12254200	12258600	while he was president 93 times out of a hundred she backed
12258600	12259600	his legislation.
12259600	12263000	It was one of the highest Republican ratings while Trump
12263000	12263800	was in office.
12264200	12267800	She was a dutiful soldier until January 6th.
12268400	12270000	Well, I said hold on go ahead.
12270200	12273700	Okay, so we have the voting part of that right you said
12273700	12276400	there was two other things right how they conduct themselves
12276400	12279700	and how they I can't what was the other one and how they
12279700	12281800	vote how they vote how they conduct themselves who they
12281800	12286200	support so so Liz Cheney did not support Donald Trump at
12286200	12289400	all in terms of outside of voting, right?
12289700	12292400	She's a definitely a log cabinet Republican.
12292800	12296200	She she's made her statements clear that so outside of the
12296200	12298400	one way of support that actually matters.
12298500	12299300	She didn't okay.
12299300	12300200	So, okay.
12300700	12303900	Well, here's the issue right most of Trump's legislation
12303900	12305700	wasn't created by Trump.
12305700	12308400	It was created by other Republicans right was going to get
12308400	12309300	the credit for it.
12309700	12314200	I mean from I guess no, it's not it's listen.
12314600	12315700	This is this is the beef.
12315700	12319400	It's not an I guess when legislation passes under the
12319500	12321600	it's the president who gets the credit.
12321700	12323600	That's just how our politics works.
12323600	12326000	Whether whether that's right or wrong and you could easily
12326000	12328000	make the argument that once you get to the nuts and bolts
12328000	12330200	as wrong, that's how it works.
12330600	12335300	She backed Trump's legislation 93% of the time more than
12335300	12338600	the vast majority of not just Congress, but even fellow
12338600	12343000	Republicans she voted for him for president twice.
12343500	12347400	What do you have prior to January 6th to indicate her strong
12347400	12351900	opposition that would that is meaningfully counterweights
12351900	12353500	what we just described.
12353800	12354300	Okay.
12355500	12360200	When did Trump call Dick Cheney?
12362200	12364500	A loser or is it coward?
12370800	12372000	Let's see.
12372100	12374400	Was it now that seems way too.
12374400	12376000	Are you sure you're not thinking of John McCain?
12376400	12377100	Was it McCain?
12377200	12378300	Trump called a lot of people.
12378300	12379200	It was McCain.
12379200	12379700	Not yet.
12379700	12380700	It was John McCain.
12380700	12383800	Not, you know, not Cheney, but but to be fair.
12384000	12388200	It's an easy mistake to make as Trump has said a lot of bad
12388200	12389200	shit about a lot.
12389200	12389700	They're both.
12389700	12393000	I think I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that he he also shit on
12393000	12393500	like that.
12394000	12395600	It's just possible.
12395600	12397500	He might have he he should have a lot of people.
12397500	12398000	Let's be honest.
12398000	12399500	Yeah, he did.
12399600	12400700	No, I'm pretty sure.
12400700	12401000	Yeah.
12401000	12405300	I think this is a mix-up because I know Megan McCain after
12405300	12407100	her dad got shit on by Trump.
12407300	12410000	She like immediately turned on Trump and she did so long
12410000	12412200	before January 6th, right?
12412500	12413600	Yeah, absolutely.
12414700	12416900	That is not my recollection of Liz Cheney.
12416900	12420100	Liz Cheney was a dutiful soldier with her with how she voted
12420100	12424600	as a member of Congress in 2000 2016 to 2020 almost most
12424600	12428500	definitely and again to the reason I brought it up is because
12428500	12432900	her and the other Republicans were immediately cast out and
12433000	12437300	Immediately castigated as never Trumpers as all rhinos.
12437600	12441200	She was the third in command of the House Republican Conference.
12441200	12443900	She had a job that currently Elise Stefanik has.
12445600	12448400	She was censured by the Republican Party as a result of
12448400	12450900	her opposition to Trump post January 6th.
12451900	12453500	So no, I listen.
12453600	12456000	I'm not saying that that means you have to accept the merits.
12456000	12459200	It's entirely possible that there is a relatively bipartisan
12459200	12462000	coalition of anti Trumpers and that doesn't mean you're obligated
12462400	12463500	Believe that they're right.
12463600	12467200	I'm just telling you it is a fact and it is a fact that
12467200	12468500	it's not just Democrats.
12468700	12472500	It is mostly Democrats, but there is a sizable portion of
12472500	12476800	lifelong conservatives and former Republican officials who
12476800	12481600	despise the man and for legitimate reasons, not just because
12481600	12484600	he insulted their dads last word Artemis and I'd like to
12484600	12487700	have this in a more long form, but I know that actually
12487700	12490800	yeah, cuz I wanted to talk about the January 6th committee.
12490800	12495100	Yeah, so Artemis and I you and I've been I've been talking
12495100	12496900	for like a week now with the January 6th committee.
12496900	12500200	And yeah, yeah, they've been some fun conversation.
12500200	12500600	How about this?
12500600	12503700	How about this next week next week?
12503700	12505800	I have I'm putting my schedule together.
12505900	12508700	You guys tell me when you can make it and I'll say some time
12508700	12510000	and we can do the January 6th.
12510600	12512700	I am procrastinating right now.
12512700	12514800	Like you wouldn't believe we're all here.
12514800	12516800	Let's just chat for like half an hour.
12516800	12517800	Let's just like listen.
12517800	12519100	Yeah, I got hungry.
12519100	12522300	I got whoever is under you don't have to do you just be
12522300	12524100	here. Hold on.
12524100	12524300	Hold on.
12524300	12527000	I've got it here.
12527000	12529200	We can TLDR really quick.
12529200	12532200	So basically Artemis you and I were arguing you are just
12532200	12534000	let me know if I'm if I'm mischaracterizing you.
12534000	12538900	Okay, you think the January 6th committee is not valid for
12538900	12541700	two reasons as far as I understand, right?
12541900	12544900	And one reason is because it was it was based.
12544900	12547000	Well, first of all, one reason is because evidence from it
12547000	12551600	was destroyed and the second reason is because there were
12551600	12554900	no Republicans on the committee or they were there like Rhinos
12554900	12557800	on the committee and not actually McCarthy's five picks,
12557800	12558100	right?
12558100	12559100	Was it those two reasons?
12559100	12561900	I would actually say that Liz Cheney and the other guy were
12561900	12564600	probably more Republican than the actual Republican Party
12564600	12565100	is now.
12565600	12566000	Okay.
12567200	12570500	The issue is you can't call Liz Cheney a rhino because
12570500	12573500	Republicans were stood for blood and mine oil.
12574200	12575200	Like okay, no fair enough.
12575200	12577300	They would go to fuck up every other country.
12577300	12578200	There was here.
12578500	12581600	I'll rephrase there were no like Pro Trump positions on
12581600	12582100	the panel.
12582100	12583500	No populist types.
12583500	12583900	Yeah.
12584100	12588400	Yeah, and so therefore because Jim Jordan who's the most
12588400	12593400	notorious for I'm gonna get drink keep talking cross-examining
12593400	12597100	witnesses was not allowed on there is one of the biggest
12597100	12600200	things and so when you and I argued about this I said well,
12600200	12603300	it was because Jim Jordan was one of the guys being investigated
12603300	12603900	by the panel.
12603900	12606400	So it would be inappropriate for him to sit on the panel
12606400	12608400	investigating the event when he was part of the event.
12609000	12613200	Yeah, and I and I criticized that because the the the the
12613200	12617600	panel the J6 Commission didn't exist to do to state that
12617600	12620000	they're investigating in before that decision was made.
12620000	12623300	So yeah, so it was yeah, so so so your view from what I
12623300	12625400	understand is that it's that that's post hoc reasoning.
12625400	12628700	It's like how did we know that Jim Jordan was involved in
12628700	12631200	the situation before the panel was put together?
12631200	12635100	So when Nancy Pelosi rejects Jim Jordan as a pick, how
12635100	12637500	did she know that he was inappropriate to sit on the panel
12637500	12639700	because the panel hadn't discovered anything yet because
12639700	12642200	there's no evidence of her reasoning.
12642200	12644200	I mean if she if she had it she should have posted at
12644200	12648900	the time right and my view on that is basically that Nancy
12648900	12652900	Pelosi is this cutthroat lifelong politician who probably
12652900	12656500	has her finger in every single pie in Washington DC and
12656500	12659900	there is no way she didn't know beforehand that Jim Jordan's
12659900	12661400	name was going to come up in this committee.
12662100	12664800	Well, I believe if because you got to remember that there
12664800	12668400	was evidence and you know, just due to the the reporting
12668400	12669100	of the event.
12669100	12673300	I'd have to go back to the timeline but there were I'm almost
12673300	12677500	certain allegations of Jim Jordan's impropriety with respect
12677500	12680200	to Trump's schemes to overthrow the election prior to the
12680200	12684200	formation of the January 6 select committee me and if unless
12684200	12688100	I'm wrong it's possible, but I doubt it that means that
12688100	12691100	she had a sufficient predicate to think that Jim Jordan
12691100	12695900	may be materially relevant to the the scope of the investigation.
12695900	12697700	I think that's a fair assumption to me.
12697700	12700500	So here's the thing if that's true though because Artemis
12700500	12702100	and I went through this if that's true.
12702100	12704500	She didn't say it at all because we went searching for
12704500	12707900	like what did Nancy Pelosi say before the January 6 or
12707900	12710900	he was formed we went looking and the only thing she said
12710900	12714100	is she just said I think he's inappropriate his actions
12714100	12714700	in his comments.
12714700	12717700	She was very vague about it and I can only point to the
12717700	12720900	Fox News nighttime things where he was on there talking
12720900	12724900	about it about the what he said to the president and that
12724900	12725200	was it.
12725200	12726200	Right, right.
12726200	12728900	And I think that's some of the the evidence I'm thinking
12728900	12731300	of because I remember people asking him and there were a
12731300	12733600	couple of awkward interviews like did you hey, did you ever
12733600	12737700	talk to Donald Trump on January 6 and he's like why me?
12737700	12739800	I talked I talked to the president all the time.
12739800	12741200	It's a great moment.
12741200	12742000	I saw that.
12742000	12745600	Yeah, the big issue is is that oh, no, go ahead.
12745600	12745900	Sorry.
12746000	12748900	No, I was just gonna say and by the way Artemis kidding
12748900	12751100	aside and this is why I didn't have a problem with this
12751100	12754000	earlier. I like throwing elbows and we can tell you that
12754000	12754500	was fun.
12754500	12757800	I love yeah, I love going off on lactoid and back and forth.
12757800	12762600	Yeah, so so I don't I don't I miss the Bloodsport days when
12762600	12766600	I was actually known on the internet right now.
12766600	12769900	You're known for being an Irish teen genius who so yeah,
12769900	12771800	yeah, it was a horrible movie.
12771800	12774500	Oh, but without revealing this without revealing the secret
12774500	12777000	Artemis had a different name black back in the Bloodsport
12777000	12779700	days and he had a name for himself back then which he abandoned
12779700	12780700	a large man.
12781100	12781700	Oh God.
12781700	12782100	Okay.
12782100	12782400	All right.
12782400	12784400	Well, I do not want to know.
12784400	12785600	I'm just popping off.
12785700	12787300	I'm just good reason YouTube.
12787300	12788100	I don't want to know.
12790500	12790800	Go ahead.
12790800	12791500	Go keep going.
12791500	12793800	I was just gonna say I was just gonna say so in conclusion
12794300	12799000	I would offer as a as a counter proposition to to to your
12799000	12803600	point that that Pelosi never gave reason explicitly maybe
12803800	12806200	she felt it would have been inappropriate to kind of like
12806200	12809400	precast Jim Jordan's going to be under investigation.
12809900	12812100	I'm not saying that that's the right way to handle it.
12812100	12814000	But that I that makes sense to me.
12814000	12817900	So so do you know Eric Swalwell is do okay.
12817900	12821600	Do you remember what the big what the big committees he
12821600	12826000	was on? I believe it was oversight and Judiciary wasn't
12826000	12829200	it? I thought it was like intelligence right as well House
12829200	12830900	and tell there is a House Intelligence Committee.
12830900	12834600	Yeah, and he was on there in his his his fling with a suspected
12834600	12835400	Chinese pie.
12835700	12835900	Yeah.
12835900	12839400	So when they didn't remove him from an obvious relationship
12839400	12845900	with a spy Chinese by that never like that that was confirmed
12845900	12848400	a relationship at a for a period of time doesn't really
12848400	12851800	matter how long or like they didn't get into what they discussed
12851800	12854800	at all, but that in and of itself they never removed him
12854800	12857200	from that committee at all during that period of time.
12858200	12862300	So I would I would want to go back and fact-check the details
12862300	12865100	of that because number one, I don't know if it was ever confirmed
12865100	12869700	that she was a spy number two the extent and the timeline
12869700	12874000	of the involvement probably does matter but note that they
12874000	12878400	didn't kick they didn't kick Jim Jordan out of the House
12878400	12880900	Judiciary Committee or how to vet of anything else.
12880900	12884300	They just said that he couldn't be on this specific subcommittee
12884300	12887800	and I do think that's different than kicking somebody off
12887800	12890200	a committee on which they already are.
12890200	12891200	I do think that's different.
12891200	12894900	I don't know if Peng Feng or Christina Feng or whatever
12894900	12898800	her name is was ever confirmed 100% but almost by the way,
12898800	12899500	I just want to clarify.
12899500	12901900	I don't think I do think that that merits investigation.
12901900	12903900	I'm not saying that that means that that you give them a
12903900	12904700	blank check.
12904700	12907200	So normally what happens in an investigation?
12907200	12911500	I have a top secret clearance secure compartmentalized
12911500	12915000	information one whenever you're on investigation for security
12915000	12918300	issues, you lose your clearance temporarily and you're
12918300	12922800	removed from any jobs related to that until the investigation
12922800	12925000	is over that is a normal process.
12925000	12930200	So when they didn't do that and he sits on classified boards
12930200	12932600	and briefings still during that period of time.
12932600	12936200	He wasn't removed until the Republicans took over and he
12936200	12937400	was denied his seat again.
12938400	12941600	So right, so he was yes, he was removed from the committee
12941600	12944100	once the majority change hands a couple of things.
12944100	12946700	I'll say again because because you have me at a disadvantage
12946700	12949100	here in the sense that I'm not intimately familiar with the
12949100	12952200	story except the broad strokes number one.
12952200	12956300	I don't think the house has anything to do with top secret
12956300	12958000	clearance in the sense that I don't think they're the ones
12958000	12958500	who give it.
12958500	12959100	I think that's all.
12959100	12960100	No, no, they receive it.
12960700	12961000	Right.
12961000	12963600	That's on there that he would be executive.
12963900	12965100	Yeah, I'm the executive branch.
12965100	12966200	So I agree.
12967000	12969100	What I'm saying is that's not Pelosi's call to make that
12969100	12972200	would have been that would have been the relevant executive
12972200	12973100	branch agency.
12973400	12976600	I think actually would be well losing these clearance would
12976600	12980200	be an executive right, but removing it from that community
12980200	12981400	would be her decision.
12981500	12982900	That would have been her call.
12982900	12983500	Yes.
12984000	12988000	So what I'm saying is I would need to know more about what
12988000	12990700	steps if any were taken and what the rationale was but I
12990700	12993900	could conceive of a situation where it's like listen, she's
12993900	12995000	a suspected spy.
12995000	12998000	It doesn't look good, but we have no real evidence to suggest
12998000	13000800	that you had engaged in any acts of impropriety.
13000800	13003700	So we're not going to remove you from a committee on which
13003700	13006200	you already are in contrast.
13006600	13008600	Pelosi could have been saying based on reports.
13008600	13013100	We do have some evidence to indicate that Jim Jordan was
13013100	13016700	involved in whatever Trump was up to up to legal or illegal
13016700	13018500	whatever but the subject of the investment.
13018500	13022300	Let me put you like this reason Eric Swalwell if there was
13022300	13026700	an investigation into Eric Swalwell's mistress, Eric Swalwell
13026700	13028000	should not be on that committee.
13028000	13029600	If he's on the committee, he should be removed.
13029600	13031500	If he wasn't on it in the first place, he should never be
13031500	13032100	put on it.
13032400	13035800	That's what I think more comparable what happened with Jim
13035800	13040100	Jordan. In this case, Jim Jordan's Chinese mistress was Donald
13040100	13045000	Trump. And so I think the issue would go to okay.
13045000	13050200	Well, I look at the details if you want them.
13050900	13058200	So so basically Christine Fang she had been since 2012 cultivating
13058200	13062300	contacts with politicians in California that the Chinese
13062300	13066200	government had had believed would one.
13066200	13066600	Yeah.
13066900	13070000	Well, so they independently found something from the Chinese
13070000	13072400	government saying that China taken took an interest in a
13072400	13077100	list of Californian politicians and swallow was on the list.
13077100	13080100	And then this woman Christine Fang shows up and starts getting
13080100	13082400	heavily involved out of nowhere starts getting heavily involved
13082400	13083300	in his campaign.
13083500	13086600	She was also cultivating contacts with everyone else on that
13086600	13089500	list. So they didn't really they didn't get her on being a
13089500	13092200	spy, but she was doing all the things that a spy would do
13092200	13094100	based on the document they got from the Chinese.
13094100	13097500	She also fled to an embassy and then got you know, which
13097500	13098200	yeah then left.
13098400	13099200	Yeah, the return of China.
13099200	13101500	Yeah, so probably probably a spy probably a spy.
13101600	13107000	So what happened was she participated in his campaign in
13107000	13113900	2014, but in 2015 US intelligence briefed him about
13113900	13117400	possible spies and then Swalwell said oh shit.
13117400	13121200	She's probably a spy and then cut contact with her and it
13121200	13125500	turns out that Fang didn't even get any documents or any
13125500	13128800	information from him during that time that that because
13128800	13131500	here's the thing she was involved in his campaign, but
13131500	13134200	she was not involved with him after he got elected and
13134200	13136700	no information was leaked to her during during their
13136800	13139800	hold and I thought the story was I thought he'd been sleeping
13139800	13141500	with this Chinese chick who is taking.
13141500	13144500	I thought he might have been well, here's the thing they
13144500	13145400	discovered it.
13145700	13147100	Well, maybe he slept with her.
13147700	13150900	Well, they discovered they discovered that she had been
13150900	13153500	sleeping with at least two of her other contacts that she
13153500	13156500	had developed but not necessarily him.
13156800	13160200	So so if you wait, hold on Artemis, you said he admitted
13160200	13160900	to sleeping with her.
13160900	13161900	Is that true or not?
13162300	13164500	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's true that he said that because
13165500	13170700	we can find that cats it has sexual relationships with two
13170700	13174100	unidentified Miss Midwestern mayors, but not with Swalwell
13174600	13176000	though allegations persisted.
13176000	13178200	He was a national security threat by being associated with
13178200	13184000	her. So I think it's because I think it's because they did
13184000	13186000	investigate him and they discovered that nothing was actually
13186000	13186400	leaked.
13186400	13190100	So they just kind of let it be but I'm sure if they discovered
13190100	13191900	oh, he's actually compromised.
13192000	13193800	They probably would have taken him off that committee and
13193800	13194500	rightfully so.
13194500	13198400	Yeah, cuz here it says that Saul refuses to say if he had
13198400	13201900	sex with Fang Fang claiming it's a matter of national security
13201900	13204000	not that he could share any details of their relationship.
13204000	13206800	No, the fact that her name is Fang Fang is like a James Bond
13206800	13207300	movie, dude.
13207300	13207800	It's great.
13207800	13210800	Well, they say they say Fang is one.
13210900	13212600	You guys remember I'm going to make a racist joke.
13212800	13216500	You guys remember the this isn't even a joke.
13216500	13217200	This is a true story.
13217900	13222900	The Chinese jet who rammed an American spy plane back in
13222900	13226600	1999 2000 that kind of air vaguely vaguely recall this.
13226600	13228500	I think yeah, the pilot's name.
13228500	13228900	I shit.
13228900	13231100	You not was a long way.
13235600	13238700	So let me ask you Artemis because I'm doing some last minute
13238700	13239700	Google food here.
13239700	13240200	Go for it.
13240900	13242500	And that was also not a racist joke.
13242500	13245600	That was just a come through reference to just just make
13245600	13246300	the racist jokes.
13246300	13246900	It's okay.
13247000	13248200	No, no listening.
13248200	13249400	I'm popped again.
13249400	13252600	I can't I will not compromise my trajectory with that
13252600	13254200	shenaniganry true.
13254400	13264800	So does it does it matter to you that so according to Wikipedia
13264800	13271300	Destiny's favorite source on in May late like mid-may 2019
13271300	13273400	or excuse me, May 19th 2021.
13273400	13276200	That was when they decided to drop it, right?
13276800	13279700	No, that was when they decided to form the house January 6
13279700	13280400	select committee.
13280500	13286000	Yeah about May 19th 2021 the matter to you that in March
13286000	13292800	2021 Kevin McCarthy went he tried to remove Eric Swalwell
13293200	13296800	the House Intelligence Committee by passing a resolution.
13297400	13302100	So for context he they tried to move to remove Eric Swalwell
13302100	13306300	from that committee two months before the committee the
13306300	13309000	separate committee the the house January 6 select committee
13309600	13314000	was launched from which Jim Jordan was rejected.
13314000	13317000	So actually it was Kevin McCarthy who made the first attempt
13317000	13317500	to move.
13318000	13322500	So the the statement by McCarthy was because a person that
13322500	13328400	had relations with a quote-unquote spy a clear issue with
13329400	13333400	having holding a class AA clearance on the House Intelligence
13333400	13339900	Committee that is the the stuff there as a as a leap of logic
13339900	13341400	is almost non-existent.
13341400	13343900	You could just you could easily see why somebody would have
13343900	13346700	an issue with somebody being on the committee, right, but
13346700	13348800	I would argue the same I would argue.
13348800	13352700	I don't know where where it measures but I think that you
13352700	13355900	could easily make the case for Jim Jordan given what we knew
13355900	13359400	about Jim Jordan's relationship with Trump and on the events
13359400	13361400	leading up to January 6th at the time.
13361600	13364100	Yeah, I think you could easily make the same justification
13364100	13367400	that listen this guy might fall under the scope of the investigation
13367400	13371300	maybe not but either way we can't we need to not give him
13371300	13375200	a position to influence the investigation and they and they
13375200	13378500	did it after and they did it after McCarthy tried to remove
13378500	13379100	Swalwell.
13379100	13380100	I think that matters.
13380300	13382600	I well there was a recommend.
13382600	13383300	Hey, I'm sorry.
13383300	13385300	My camera just kicked off.
13385300	13386600	So I'll just be on audio.
13386800	13390700	Okay, I've been using my I would say two things one that
13390700	13398500	was a request that didn't go anywhere which we know of as
13398500	13399700	for the J6 things.
13399700	13405700	I'm gonna make a two different arguments one is a knowledge
13405700	13406600	based argument.
13408300	13413700	If you have reason to suspect that somebody is going to be
13413700	13417500	implicated in a investigation for the quote-unquote overthrow
13417800	13419200	attempted overthrow of the United States.
13419700	13421600	You might want to put that out into the public that way
13421600	13424600	they can understand your decision-making at least some of
13424600	13427700	the evidence there because we didn't you're going to get
13427700	13430900	maligned with accusations of bias.
13431400	13436200	The second thing is a pragmatic argument of if you didn't
13436200	13439200	have this evidence to throw out there, but you had you know
13439200	13443800	suspicions for the sake of looking a nonpartisan in a neutral
13443800	13448400	RI body trying to do fact-find you don't get rid of the top
13448400	13449400	Republicans.
13451000	13454000	That everybody likes out of the Commission and deny them
13454500	13457200	because you're going to get an issue where we have it now
13457200	13461500	where the J6 is nothing but considered evil Satan on the
13461500	13466100	right and the average population or the average citizen
13466100	13467900	of the United States doesn't actually give a shit about
13467900	13468600	what it found.
13469000	13471400	So a couple of things number one.
13471500	13475300	It wasn't a request Kevin McCarthy made a formal resolution
13475300	13478900	to remove Swalwell from House Intelligence Committee.
13478900	13479700	It wasn't a request.
13479700	13481400	He tried to get it done by force.
13481400	13483100	He just didn't have the votes number one, right?
13483100	13485100	So it was a when I say request.
13485100	13488800	I mean like he proffered to do it and he tried to do it
13488800	13490500	and if he had his way it would have been done.
13490500	13492700	He just didn't have the support for it number one and he
13492700	13496300	get attempted at first and it was also a committee on which
13496300	13501100	Swalwell was currently seated number one number two, I would
13501100	13504500	argue that you wouldn't put that information out in the in
13504500	13508700	the public prematurely, even if it casts a pall on the investigation
13508700	13511200	like why aren't you seating Jim Jordan?
13511900	13515200	I agree that there's probably no satisfying way to do it
13515200	13519000	because if what if what you recommended was done and it
13519000	13521200	could be seen as prejudicing the investigation.
13521200	13522200	Okay, what's your evidence?
13522200	13524400	Well, we're not prepared to produce it yet because the committee
13524400	13526900	hasn't gotten started and by the way, we don't know where
13526900	13527400	it's going.
13527400	13531100	So the last thing we want to do is preemptively make act
13531100	13533400	against a sitting member of Congress.
13533400	13535700	I think you could easily make the argument that that was
13535700	13539700	the responsible thing to do and number number three, which
13539700	13546700	is the second point on this last part is the reason that
13546700	13551900	the committee ended up being so skewed is because Kevin McCarthy
13551900	13554500	Nancy Pelosi who did not have to do this.
13554800	13557600	He could have played hardball and said I'm the speaker Kevin
13557600	13559100	McCarthy. You're my bitch.
13559100	13562500	I'll just do whatever I want said is a gesture of good faith.
13562500	13564600	She said listen, let's do it 9-11 style.
13565500	13567100	I'll pick five Democrats.
13567100	13570900	You pick five Republicans will get equal subpoena power equal
13570900	13572400	time yada yada yada.
13573800	13581500	McCarthy offered five nominees and Nancy Pelosi shot down
13581500	13585100	two who were seen as potential witnesses or potential
13585900	13588200	potentially involved in the situation.
13588200	13590200	So she said listen those other three fine.
13590200	13592200	These two can't do it.
13592200	13595700	So can you pick some others and Kevin McCarthy said no it's
13595700	13598900	either my five the five that I named or none at all.
13599100	13605800	Yep, that's McCarthy's decision me because if you keep going
13605800	13606800	and I'll respond.
13606800	13609100	That's why I can say Kevin Kevin McCarthy.
13609100	13613700	It's not like it's not like Pelosi said you can't make any
13614000	13617500	Republicans or that there are no Republicans whatsoever.
13617900	13619500	She said give me five.
13619500	13623400	You just can't have these two and Kevin McCarthy refused I
13623400	13626100	would argue given that there were hundreds, you know, at
13626100	13628900	least 150 Republicans in the house at the time.
13628900	13630300	I can't remember the exact breakdown.
13630300	13634300	I think it had to be close to 200 plenty of other options.
13635300	13637100	So that's that's McCarthy's fault.
13637100	13641000	Not Pelosi's I would say that you're you're trying to say
13641000	13643400	trying to so you're looking at this in a vacuum.
13643600	13648100	Unfortunately, the Democratic the Democrats I just got out
13648100	13652100	of two different impeachment attempts where the impeachment
13652100	13656600	inquiry was basically rail road through by one side and
13656600	13661500	so he attempted an olive branch by allowing pro-Trump voices
13661500	13666500	onto the thing to give some balance to this committee, even
13666500	13668400	though it was obviously the findings are going to be negative
13668400	13671500	towards Trump and Republicans, but he was trying to provide
13671500	13675600	some balance there and once they were rejected the two most
13675600	13679700	like the most favored Republican Congressman in the nation
13680200	13682500	that people like never removed from it.
13683000	13686400	I there was no there was no like nobody was no Republican
13686400	13689300	was going to be satisfied with McCarthy and vote for him
13689300	13690300	again if he allowed it.
13690600	13694300	Wait, so so so this is this is where okay.
13694300	13697500	So yes impeachments tend to be partisan right now.
13697500	13699900	We're experiencing a partisan impeachment the impeachment
13699900	13703600	effort against president was partisan as well and Bush
13703600	13708300	impeachments are partisan by definition now, so so I don't
13708300	13710700	think that that has any bearing on the January 6th select
13710700	13713900	committee because Pelosi said well, let's do it bipartisanly
13713900	13716500	equal numbers equal subpoena power.
13716900	13719800	She just said you can't have these two.
13719800	13722100	That's a reasonable request to make and you say well, they
13722100	13723600	needed a pro-Trump voice.
13723800	13726500	I would I reject the argument or the suggestion.
13726500	13728500	I'm not saying you're arguing this but the implicit the
13728500	13732300	implicit suggestion of your argument is that there were no
13732300	13736900	other pro-Trump voices besides Jim Banks and Jim Jordan
13737100	13739200	who could have been put on that committee and I just
13739200	13742100	categorically reject that there were 200 Republicans in
13742100	13747400	Congress can and and and would is or to think so McCarthy
13747400	13751600	chose the most respected Republicans in the nation to go
13751600	13754400	on there that people liked that they could be relatively
13754400	13757800	sure that people would accept being on that committee and
13757800	13761400	that would be would give some good faith to it.
13761600	13764700	So he picked people that would give some credibility.
13764700	13765900	How could it be?
13765900	13766500	I'm sorry.
13766500	13766900	I'm sorry.
13766900	13767400	I have to interrupt.
13767400	13771600	How could it be good faith if Jim Jordan is not only pro-Trump
13771600	13772600	which is fine.
13772700	13774900	Yeah, but he is potentially involved.
13774900	13778700	They have reason to believe that he was involved with the
13778700	13781900	efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
13782600	13783100	Well, let's go.
13783100	13784200	Let's go with this, right?
13784400	13789500	So the the other side is staffed with Democrats who have
13789700	13792300	all unanimously tried to impeach Trump twice.
13792700	13793100	Sure.
13793400	13793600	Okay.
13793600	13797100	So there was never going to be a nonpartisan in the way of
13797100	13798800	not asking for not but wait a minute.
13798800	13800100	I'm not asking for nonpartisan.
13800100	13800800	I agree.
13800900	13801300	I agree.
13801300	13803200	You're not going to find you're not going to find neutral
13803200	13807000	people. I'm saying they could have found other partisan
13807000	13810200	Republicans who were pro-Trump that weren't potentially
13810200	13813200	involved. The United States population had faith in.
13814100	13817700	Like they only know Jim Jordan is the only one to have that
13817700	13820200	the United States has has any faith in again.
13820200	13822500	Actually, here's the issue.
13823100	13825200	Trey Gowdy and Jim Jordan are there.
13825500	13828400	Let me hop in here Artemis because I mean Matt Gates was
13828400	13828900	in the house.
13828900	13829400	Wasn't he?
13830000	13832600	Isn't he like a well-known right-wing figure that people
13832600	13833300	on the right trust?
13833300	13835200	Like why didn't McCarthy tap him?
13835300	13837500	Because Gates and McCarthy were going at it.
13837500	13837900	Yeah.
13838600	13838900	Okay.
13838900	13839700	I mean, I don't know about that.
13839700	13840800	Maybe got him removed.
13840800	13842100	Yeah, correct.
13842100	13842600	They were fine.
13842600	13843200	They were for sure.
13843200	13843300	Sure.
13843300	13844200	But that was later.
13844200	13846000	That was like in that was no, no, no, no.
13846100	13847000	That was later.
13847300	13848300	It's a long time coming.
13848800	13849800	Yeah, it was like I was like, okay.
13849800	13850000	Yeah.
13850000	13854500	Yeah, that's he was doing an option that even for his post
13854900	13858700	when he wasn't like removing McCarthy from the position
13859000	13861900	McCarthy was removing him from like committee assignments.
13862300	13863300	Okay, right.
13863600	13866400	So I looked into into fought into the five original picks
13866400	13869900	that McCarthy brought up and one of them was Troy Nels and
13870200	13875800	Troy Nels was never involved in Trump's plans, but he was
13875800	13880400	very pro Trump and he did, he did vote to have, you know,
13880400	13882800	the ballots inspector there or the electorate inspector,
13882800	13884000	whatever, whatever the case is.
13884500	13887300	He was one of the guys who did that, but he wasn't involved
13887300	13890200	in the, in the, you know, the Eastman memo implementation.
13890200	13890600	Right.
13890900	13891100	Yeah.
13891100	13895500	So she didn't throw Troy Nels off of the five.
13895800	13898900	So Nancy Pelosi seemed to be willing to allow, you know,
13898900	13903900	very pro Trump voices onto this committee, just not the
13903900	13905000	two that were involved.
13905000	13906300	You're going to, you're going to, I'm going to go back
13906300	13911800	to the, the, the, the Republican electorate know of Jim Jordan.
13912300	13913900	He is a known quantity to them.
13914700	13915200	Right.
13915400	13919300	Let's see home most popular Republican Republican House.
13919300	13919600	Okay.
13919600	13920000	Let's see.
13920100	13922700	Yeah, that's, that's, that's a, that's a comment that people
13922700	13924200	are making about Jim Jordan.
13924200	13926700	Now, I think if you take the polling literally that also
13926700	13929400	puts Jim Jordan above Donald Trump, if I remember correctly
13929400	13933100	when I cover probably from Jim Jordan's attempt at a speakership,
13933500	13934800	but listen, I don't number one.
13934800	13937300	I don't think that was the reason Kevin McCarthy offered
13937300	13940900	at the time because to be quite frankly until Dev pointed
13940900	13942900	out that Troy Nels was one of the names I couldn't even
13942900	13945300	remember the other three names.
13945300	13948100	So it's not like they were, you know, Kevin McCarthy was
13948100	13950000	going necessarily for star power.
13950500	13952800	No, no, it's not, it's not star power.
13952800	13955900	It's, it's the, it's trust and faith in the system.
13956900	13960400	You need trust and faith in a committee for people to believe
13960400	13963300	the committee's findings and because you remove the people
13963300	13964900	that would give it the most legitimacy.
13965300	13968100	You're going to restore resulting is going to be distrust.
13968100	13969000	Well, here, here, how about this?
13969000	13969200	How about this?
13969200	13969400	How about this?
13969400	13969900	How about this?
13969900	13974000	So, so like there's definitely a conspiracy worm in my brain
13974400	13979300	that says Pelosi knowingly rejected, knowingly rejected the
13979300	13983000	most popular Republicans in order to, in order to make this,
13983000	13987800	you know just, just a witch hunt for the Democrats to go
13987800	13989100	after Trump there.
13989100	13991000	That's a conspiracy worm that I mean, it's possible.
13991000	13993100	I guess it's possible, but there's an alternate
13993100	13996600	conspiracy worm though, where, where basically McCarthy
13996600	14001600	put forward people that, yes, McCarthy put forward people
14001600	14005100	that he knew would have to be shot down because he didn't
14005100	14007600	even want to be part of the proceedings at all and that
14007600	14009000	gave him a justification to pull out.
14010300	14013200	And paint it and paint it as partisan as a result.
14013200	14016000	The issue is, is that there's no, there's no evidence of
14016000	14019200	him knowing that, that that was going to take place.
14020000	14023600	There's evidence of him offering what he would normally
14023600	14028300	offer, the leading like Republican figure, which is Jim
14028300	14031800	Jordan, a position that he asked for on the committee and
14031800	14034000	then getting, they're getting rejected and then saying,
14034000	14035900	okay, well, this is obviously partisan and pulling out.
14036700	14039000	Like we have evidence for those two things.
14040400	14043300	I think I reject some of the premises there.
14043300	14046500	Number one, I don't know if that was the reason that Kevin
14046500	14048900	McCarthy offered Jim Jordan in the first place.
14048900	14051600	And even if it is, I don't think that if that obligates
14051600	14054700	Nancy Pelosi to accept Jim Jordan, when there's sufficient
14054700	14058200	reason to believe that Jim Jordan may be implicated in
14058200	14059600	the scope of the investigation.
14061300	14064000	Yeah, I don't, I don't, no, no, no, because it's fine.
14064000	14065700	The bet, the back and forth is good, but I just don't want
14065700	14066700	to lose my train of thought here.
14066700	14067100	Yeah, go for it.
14067100	14071600	I don't think that Nancy Pelosi was obligated to give
14071600	14075400	Jim Jordan that position while knowing that, that he may
14075400	14077600	be implicated in the scope of the investigation.
14077800	14080500	I think it's reasonable for Nancy Pelosi to say, listen,
14081500	14084000	I'm kind of being generous right now anyway, doing this
14084000	14088800	9-11 style bipartisan commission and giving you all equal
14088800	14090000	subpoena power.
14090200	14092400	You have 200 members in your conference.
14092400	14096400	You need, you can find five pro-Trump names who are trusted
14096400	14098900	by their constituents to put on here.
14098900	14102400	You just can't put people on here who may be implicated
14102400	14104200	in the scope of the investigation.
14104700	14107400	And for Kevin McCarthy to just reject that out of hand
14107400	14110600	and say, listen, no, it's Jim Jordan, Jim Banks, and these
14110600	14112400	other three or none at all.
14113600	14116000	I think that, let me ask you this.
14117000	14120300	What should, what should Pelosi have done, especially with
14120300	14123900	hindsight? Hindsight, if she wanted the J-6 committee's
14123900	14127600	findings to be considered anywhere credible, she should
14127600	14128800	have had Jim Jordan on there.
14129600	14131300	Regardless of whether or not he would have been called to
14131300	14134700	testify, they could have that instance happen where the
14134700	14138500	committee calls Jim Jordan to testify and he just publicly
14138500	14140100	says, no, I'm not doing it.
14140200	14141400	I would be fine with that.
14142100	14143500	I'm sure you would be.
14143500	14144600	I just don't know.
14144600	14149100	Let me, I don't think you would ever accept it if the shoe
14149100	14150200	was on the other foot.
14150200	14153900	Hey, give this Democrat witness who may be investigated and
14153900	14157600	put him in a position to influence the investigation in
14157600	14159600	question with equal subpoena power.
14160400	14162700	I don't think you would accept that nor should you, quite
14162700	14164400	frankly, that would be absurd.
14164500	14167800	We had to accept that during the crossfire hurricane and
14167800	14173100	the special counsel for Robert.
14173100	14173700	What was it?
14174000	14174800	Robert Mueller.
14175200	14177900	Okay, before you get into that, I know I'm now an hour
14177900	14180700	late and I have to go before you get into that.
14180800	14182600	We are, I have one final question.
14182600	14184600	Can you give me like the 32nd version of it?
14184700	14189600	Just the other instance of, I have heard something about
14189700	14191800	the January 6th committee destroying evidence.
14191800	14193300	It wasn't just nonsense.
14193300	14196500	I read an LA Times article about how some of it was destroyed.
14196700	14197500	What was the deal there?
14198400	14201700	Um, I know the, how do I say this?
14202300	14204900	So there was supposed to be exculpatory evidence that some
14204900	14210400	of the defendants were asking for that like videotapes of
14210400	14214300	themselves and how they were caught or whatever and they
14214300	14215600	weren't given any of that.
14216200	14218700	And then when they went to go asking for it, they said they
14218700	14220200	didn't have it and didn't have to give it.
14220700	14224000	And then when the Republicans were taking over the house
14224000	14227200	and the committee was told to preserve all of the data,
14228000	14231000	they didn't and then now it's no longer in existence.
14231500	14235600	Yeah, so from the LA Times article on the topic, possession
14235600	14238100	of the massive trove of evidence collected by the committee
14238100	14240800	was long expected to remain an issue on Capitol Hill once
14240800	14242100	the panel's work was done.
14242500	14245300	The select committee's 18 month investigation is believed
14245300	14248200	to be among the most extensive probes in congressional history,
14248500	14251900	but much of it was done behind closed doors, so the full
14251900	14253500	extent of what was collected is unknown.
14253900	14255700	Committee staff spoke with more than a thousand people
14255700	14258300	for the investigation, which resulted in millions of pages
14258300	14263500	of depositions, cell phone and text records, emails, staff
14263500	14265600	notes, and analysis by outside organizations.
14266100	14269200	Official records are typically handed over to a successor
14269200	14272100	committee, then to the house clerk and eventually to the
14272100	14275700	national archives where they're shielded by law from public
14275700	14277300	view for at least 30 years.
14277300	14279900	When Republicans took control of the house in January,
14280500	14283700	they included something new in the rules for the 118th
14283700	14286700	Congress, an order that all documents that were retained
14286700	14289500	from the house January 6 committee go to the house
14289500	14290600	administration committee.
14291100	14293500	All materials already sent to the national archives
14293500	14294800	were to be returned.
14296500	14299200	But I guess because this was from a new Congress,
14299200	14300900	they didn't honor that rule because it took place
14300900	14301900	in the previous Congress.
14302100	14305700	The leader of the committee said that he didn't think
14306200	14309100	they were, that he needed to preserve them so he didn't
14310200	14311900	is the, I think the direct quote.
14313100	14316100	If you, if I'm looking at that article with you because
14316100	14318700	again, I've heard this allegation as well.
14318900	14322600	I recall fact-checkers saying that it was not true, that
14322600	14325000	evidence was not knowingly destroyed.
14325000	14328300	If you read on those articles, it says that house rule,
14328300	14331900	it looks like seven, job lines preservation of house records
14331900	14334000	at the end of each two-year Congress and has been used
14334000	14337000	by nearly every Congress including the current one loosely
14337000	14338700	defines what has to be preserved.
14338700	14341200	It says the committee should preserve quote an official
14341200	14343700	permanent record of the committee including any record
14343700	14346700	of a legislative oversight or any or other activity of
14346700	14348400	such committee or subcommittee thereof.
14348700	14351200	What committees consider an official record have varied
14351200	14352300	widely over the years.
14352300	14354700	For some, the definition includes transcripts, official
14354700	14356700	correspondence, and drafts of legislation.
14357200	14359600	Other committees might include staff notes and internal
14359600	14363300	memos. Some preserve only their final report and notices
14363300	14366500	of hearings that were held. McCarthy, who is now speaker,
14366500	14368900	sent Benny Thompson a letter in December demanding the
14368900	14372300	preservation of all records collected and transcripts of
14372300	14375200	testimony taken during your investigation in accordance
14375200	14378200	with house rules, but he had no authority to enforce it
14378200	14380900	because the committee disbanded moments before the new
14380900	14384000	Congress controlled by Republicans was sworn in, their
14384000	14386900	new rule for ordering preservation of any non-concurrent
14386900	14389600	records from the committee could only apply to records
14389600	14392400	that had already been transferred to a successor committee
14392400	14395500	or to the National Archives. In essence, the Republicans
14395500	14398400	couldn't order the Jan 6 select committee to turn anything
14398400	14400700	over because it didn't exist existed.
14400700	14401700	Yeah, I read that one.
14402000	14405800	Yeah, and that tells me that because it because they because
14405800	14409000	it the new rule didn't take into place until after the
14409000	14413200	J6 committee was torn down and McCarthy didn't have any
14413200	14415400	power to tell them to hold on to it.
14415500	14419700	They decided not to keep it or that that tells me that
14420200	14422900	But if you if you read two paragraphs down, do you see
14422900	14426200	the step that Thompson said the select committee was not
14426200	14429100	obligated to archive all video recordings of transcribed
14429100	14431800	interviews or depositions, but determined that written
14431800	14433400	transcripts were sufficient.
14433400	14436900	So there is a record just not the total record that Republicans
14436900	14438500	wanted which was apparently the video tape.
14438500	14439400	So here's the thing.
14439400	14440200	Here's the thing, right?
14440300	14442600	Well, let me jump in here because I do I do have to go
14442600	14443100	right now.
14443300	14444200	We got a gang.
14444200	14444800	I'm hungry.
14444800	14445400	I'm starving.
14445400	14448100	Yeah, you get angry with get a snicker.
14449100	14453200	So basically like like I know that this is the legal proceeding.
14453200	14457000	It's probably all done above board in terms of the the letter
14457000	14461300	of the law, but as a data hoarder personally, I don't like
14461300	14465900	the idea of stuff due to a rule being like arbitrarily destroyed
14465900	14468700	or deleted or not able to be seen anymore that just bothers
14468700	14472500	me in a personal level because I like to keep I hoard every
14472500	14475000	single thing that I come across in case it's useful for later
14475200	14478900	every slip of paper every link every weird conspiracy Theory.
14478900	14481200	I keep it all backed up somewhere penis doodle.
14482900	14484600	Hoarders episode for you somewhere.
14484600	14487100	I'm sure yeah, I hoard data.
14487100	14488300	I hoard data like crazy.
14488300	14492200	So when I hear this like I don't know if this could be used
14492200	14495100	legally, but it does make me think like why don't you just
14495100	14496300	why don't you just keep it guys?
14496500	14500000	Like what the fuck there is it raises questions that didn't
14500000	14500700	need to be raised.
14500800	14504900	But um before we go up, I just want to thank you Doug for
14504900	14507800	coming on spend some time with me and collabing with me
14507800	14508100	a bit.

14512200	14513100	transaction, right?

14516700	14516800	Okay.
14516800	14519600	There was like a vtuber who was saying like listen every
14519600	14521800	every time you collab with someone like someone's got to
14521800	14522800	be paying someone.
14523100	14524700	It's all it's all transactional.
14524700	14526900	There's no real friendships in the online space.
14527100	14529400	It's like what the fuck it like are you sociopathic?
14529400	14530800	What are they living in?
14530800	14533500	This is all friendship based which I mean great terrible
14533500	14534700	at the same time, right?
14535000	14536800	Dev asks me for money all the time.

14539100	14541800	cake on that's because you make six figures a month.
