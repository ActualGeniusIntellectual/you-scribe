00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
My guest of honor here is today.

00:01.500 --> 00:02.300
Let's bring him on.

00:03.200 --> 00:03.600
Hello.

00:03.600 --> 00:04.200
Can you hear me?

00:06.000 --> 00:06.600
Hello.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.400
Oh, you are super low.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.100
Can you

00:10.400 --> 00:10.600
wait?

00:10.600 --> 00:11.300
Am I low?

00:11.300 --> 00:12.300
Yeah, you're super low.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.000
It's hard to hear you.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.800
How is that possible?

00:15.800 --> 00:17.400
What do you have me set to on your end?

00:17.700 --> 00:18.300
Let me look.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.500
You're at a hundred and fifty percent.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.000
I could turn you to two hundred.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.100
Well, hold on.

00:24.100 --> 00:24.400
Hold on.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.100
I'll adjust some things.

00:25.100 --> 00:25.600
Give me a second.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.000
Okay.

00:26.100 --> 00:26.400
Yeah.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.800
Well, yeah, he's a he's getting ready.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.800
He's getting his tech stuff done gang.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.400
Don't worry.

00:33.100 --> 00:33.800
Just to let you know.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.000
This is a call-in show.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.800
So if you'd like to call in and talk to us about anything that you have on your mind,

00:39.200 --> 00:42.300
anything you've seen either of us produce or an opinion.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.700
We've stated that you want to talk to us about is more.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.100
You're more than welcome to jump on.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.100
I'll put the discord link in my chats.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.500
You click that link.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.200
You accept the rules.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.400
You jump backstage will pull you in get in line backstage.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.300
If too many people get in line, which sometimes happens.

00:57.800 --> 01:03.400
I'll try to go in the order that I see you come in, but you know, I'll do my best.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.400
It's not okay.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
How do I sound now?

01:05.400 --> 01:06.800
Oh, you sound much better.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.600
I don't know what you changed, but I can hear you now.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.300
So this is way too loud from my usual recording.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.800
So I have to remember to turn it back down.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
So I thought that we're gonna move is showing up.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.200
Has she bailed?

01:24.600 --> 01:25.500
I don't think so.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.100
I talked to her this morning.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.100
She's having a date night with her husband, but she's going to try to call in.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.200
We'll see, right?

01:32.700 --> 01:34.800
I don't know how that works, but we'll see.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.100
I hope she gets here.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.800
So let me send her a quick little message.

01:43.500 --> 01:52.400
Yeah, when you approached me for this I was like, I have no clue why you'd want to do this because there's no set topic and I'm not an interesting person on my own.

01:52.700 --> 01:53.500
What are you talking about?

01:53.700 --> 01:54.200
Yes, you are.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.400
My videos are interesting, but I'm not interesting.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.800
Why do you why do you hate yourself like this?

02:01.800 --> 02:04.400
Like if I didn't think you were interesting, I wouldn't invite you on.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.500
I don't hate myself.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.400
I just know where my strengths and weaknesses are.

02:08.400 --> 02:18.600
Well, let's interrogate this a little bit like so I see you all the time have conversations with people hours long and people tune in people watch people view it.

02:19.700 --> 02:22.400
What what what why is this different right?

02:22.400 --> 02:26.800
Like there's several things that we could talk about like the Jew tunnels.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.100
We have to I have to get your opinion, right?

02:29.700 --> 02:31.800
I have no clue what's going on with that man.

02:33.300 --> 02:42.800
It there's going to be some great memes that come out of it and we're probably going to see that video of that one Jewish guy climbing out of the sewer grate that's going to be reposted for the next 50 years.

02:42.800 --> 02:43.400
I'm sure.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, but I don't know.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.000
Did you see that?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I have I don't know that I don't know the main story there.

02:51.000 --> 03:03.000
Like I've heard some people say that like that the tunnel is actually run to was it a children's hospital or an orphanage or something and they're having sex with kids down there and like I don't know I've seen so much wacky stuff.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.200
I don't know what's true and I think the story is too new to know what's really true just yet.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.500
No, I agree with you.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.300
It's it's a it's something that they're going to investigate.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.000
We're going to find out in the future.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.900
But you're right.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.600
The means are super funny.

03:18.600 --> 03:31.100
And there's a small little interaction I saw on Twitter a while ago about a man in New York City who was complaining on Twitter that he was hearing Yiddish underneath his bed at night, right?

03:31.100 --> 03:38.100
Like it sounded like there was Jewish people digging tunnels and he was tweeting about this in November, right?

03:38.500 --> 03:46.900
And no one believes everyone thought he was just lying like he was this this huge anti-semite and I just I don't know.

03:46.900 --> 03:56.500
I can't get it out of my head where I have this image of this guy who's like legit hearing digging sounds underneath and he's trying to tell people but no one believes them.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.100
They all think he's just making it up to me.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.600
I don't know that's peak funny, but you know, maybe I'm wrong.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.700
Maybe I'm built different.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.900
I don't know but I can't stop laughing at it.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.800
So I don't know that is that is pretty funny.

04:08.800 --> 04:20.700
Yeah, like I've seen a few people claim that the New York Police rather than investigate it are just filling the tunnels with concrete and trying to like hope everyone forgets about it.

04:20.700 --> 04:21.700
I don't know if that's true.

04:21.700 --> 04:37.800
I don't I don't know what anything about this like I think we'll have to wait a little bit to see what happens if we wait a month and no one said a single peep and the and the police aren't commenting then maybe you can talk about how it might be some sort of a conspiracy but right now it's probably too soon to tell.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.900
Maybe I don't know.

04:40.900 --> 04:53.700
It's a so the rumor I've heard the more reasonable rumor I've heard is that they built these during the covid during the lockdowns because they still wanted to get to their synagogue, right?

04:53.700 --> 04:59.100
They would they wanted to congregate even during the covid lockdown, but I'm not sure how true that is.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.300
It's just something I've heard so we'll see.

05:02.300 --> 05:02.900
It's possible.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, possible.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.800
Like I said, we'll see.

05:05.800 --> 05:16.000
It's and yes, there's a lot of anti-semitism a lot of like sex with kids conspiracies and stuff and coming out of this but it's still funny.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.800
So I can't I don't know.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.500
It is pretty funny.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.100
Yeah, but I'm getting I'm gonna try to find it.

05:22.100 --> 05:22.500
Hold on.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.100
Give me just a second.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.100
A surprisingly good resource for this stuff is actually know your meme.

05:32.300 --> 05:32.800
Really?

05:33.600 --> 05:38.000
Yeah, because they do document means they also document at least some of the context behind them.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.300
I wouldn't just trust them, but they sometimes have things that others don't.

05:46.100 --> 05:50.400
So for example, here I'll DM you this.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.100
Let's see what you got.

05:53.400 --> 05:58.600
So I always take Twitter headlines of the grain of salt, right?

05:59.300 --> 06:06.000
Like for example, this guy is claiming that the other tunnels are being sealed off by the police, right?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.500
It's like well, maybe.

06:10.100 --> 06:17.200
Well, I did see I did see video of them like the one of the sewer grates welding it shut again.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.700
I have no I have no idea.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.800
This yeah, I don't know how true this is either.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.000
It is interesting though.

06:31.400 --> 06:35.000
And unfortunately, it's going to feed into a lot of stereotypes.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.700
We'll see how it goes, right?

06:36.700 --> 06:37.500
We'll see how it goes.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.000
But this is a call-in show.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
So I just wanted to let my members know if you want to call in and talk to us.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.700
You absolutely can.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.900
Thank you for the super chats, by the way.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.700
Thank you to Zephyrhash.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.300
Nobody believes me when I hear wick in my walls.

06:57.300 --> 07:01.100
Well, what they'll never find my Donald's buddy.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.900
They'll never I'm too clever.

07:02.900 --> 07:08.700
Okay, and Jacob for $5 says I know a lot about the community and can speak to this with confident knowledge.

07:10.300 --> 07:18.300
Risky risky caller, but if you want to call in and then and tell us how much you know about the Jewish community like this could go one of two ways.

07:19.300 --> 07:27.800
You could be deeply involved Hasidic Jew yourself or you could you could know what they are thinking and what they don't want you to know.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.900
I don't know but you can absolutely call in and talk to us.

07:32.500 --> 07:38.500
We do have a caller someone you and I both know and love.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.200
I'll give you a second.

07:41.200 --> 07:45.800
Our friend art of a spell.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.100
Hi Artemis.

07:51.100 --> 07:51.700
How's it going?

07:51.700 --> 07:52.500
Not bad.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.700
How are you doing?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.100
Good.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.700
So we're going with the Jewish tunnels as a topic or you you're the caller you get to talk to us about you want to talk about the Jewish tunnels.

08:04.700 --> 08:09.500
I'm out mine, but it's not going to be as entertaining as a one might think.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.800
Well, actually here do you usually you have some secret glowy knowledge.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.800
So tell us about the Jewish tunnels Artemis.

08:16.800 --> 08:36.900
Well, what do you know for starters the city of New York City has been at war with the city Jewish population ever since covid lockdown started speak specifically their shops and stores and stuff were like brutally like broken into by police because they were serving people.

08:37.900 --> 08:42.300
And getting them all shut down by by the city.

08:43.900 --> 08:52.200
I wouldn't be surprised to be honest, I think I think a lot of let's say more more religiously radical communities really bucked against the covid lockdown.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.400
So makes sense.

08:53.400 --> 09:06.600
Yeah, the it's actually so notorious that they were going after Hasidic Jewish population that they were filing complaints that they were targeting them specifically because of their ethnicity and religion.

09:07.600 --> 09:12.000
That was early on with this tunnel thing.

09:12.000 --> 09:28.200
I have heard about the child accusations and that comes from like an interview with a potential victim from a year or two ago claiming they were taken into tunnels and forced to do whatever on stained mattresses.

09:28.600 --> 09:37.500
And then you see from this tunnel thing that you seeing these weird cheap ass matches being pulled out of the tunnels and they're just stained all hell.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.000
So I think that's where they're pulling that from.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.900
Yeah, that's such a such a loose connection for session.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.500
It is but that's but that's the internet.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.100
It's going to they're going to be connections drawn like that.

09:49.100 --> 10:03.700
Well, here's the thing, like if you've ever done any sort of urban exploration, like into an abandoned building or into a like a sewer or a pipe or something that's big enough to hold people or or you go to like some isolated area, even out in the woods, you will eventually find just a dirty mattress.

10:03.700 --> 10:10.300
And what it usually is is a homeless person was squatting there for a while, you know, it's usually not some sort of weird sex cult.

10:10.300 --> 10:16.500
It's usually a homeless person who dug a mattress out of a dumpster and drag it into a tunnel and has been sleeping there for a bit.

10:16.500 --> 10:22.200
Okay, yeah, but this is this is the tunnels that are like run and maintained by the Hasidic Jewish population of this.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.400
Yeah, of this.

10:24.100 --> 10:24.600
I don't know.

10:24.600 --> 10:29.900
It's just like, look, I know people who have stained mattresses in their in their actual house, right?

10:29.900 --> 10:34.900
Yeah, I think to my knowledge, they're not kidnapping kids, right?

10:34.900 --> 10:46.100
To my knowledge, the bigger story is why is the NYC Police Department immediately going in and trying to fill the fucking tunnels of concrete without first removing everybody from them?

10:47.300 --> 10:48.000
Is it concrete?

10:48.500 --> 10:49.100
I've seen them.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.700
I've seen them weld some of the entrances.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.900
They've been they've been pouring concrete.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.600
They try to pour concrete into the tunnels.

10:55.900 --> 10:56.700
Is there proof of that?

10:57.400 --> 11:03.200
Let me go find one of the images of the the concrete slurry that was poured and then thought.

11:03.200 --> 11:12.100
Well, yeah, but it does kind of make sense that they would start welding some of the some of the entrances because you don't want people on the street falling into them and make that make sense.

11:12.300 --> 11:15.300
Yeah, they they were the Jewish were breaking the pipes.

11:15.300 --> 11:20.500
They were using the pipe the pump the concrete in the bike like breaking the tubing.

11:20.700 --> 11:31.700
So let me go find that if I also it does make sense, right that they would try to because digging under the foundations of houses and structure.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.600
It can't be good for the stability of those structures, right?

11:35.600 --> 11:36.300
It can't.

11:36.300 --> 11:36.700
Yeah.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.000
Also also we're you got to put up that image IDM.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.700
Do you bring that up?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.100
Give me a second.

11:43.100 --> 11:43.700
Hold on.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.800
I am I'm okay gang.

11:45.800 --> 11:51.200
I'm very bad at tech, but we will make this happen.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.600
Boom boom boom.

11:54.600 --> 11:54.900
Let's see.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.700
Let me find the get the correct.

11:57.700 --> 12:02.500
I'm pretty sure it should be immediately the first things I find.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.800
Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to show it to you without like exposing.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.000
All my tabs and bullshit like that.

12:16.100 --> 12:21.400
Oh my God, someone made a D&D rule set called Talmud's and tunnels.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.500
Again, the memes are going to be they're going to be a lot and they're going to be amazingly good.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.500
Okay, let's see if this works.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.700
Oh, let me get this off the cameras flickering.

12:35.700 --> 12:35.900
Yeah.

12:35.900 --> 12:36.100
Yeah.

12:36.100 --> 12:36.800
What's going on?

12:36.900 --> 12:38.500
Can we can we see this gang?

12:39.500 --> 12:46.000
Can we see the teenage Jewish Turtles or whatever they got up here?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.300
What tabs do I have with don't worry about my tabs.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.000
Okay, don't worry about my tabs.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.200
Don't worry about my being going to reveal all the DMS right?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.000
Well, let's not let's not talk about it.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.700
Okay, let's you know what?

12:59.400 --> 13:00.700
Okay, everyone saw it.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.000
Everyone got a good little good little look.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.300
Yeah, it was good.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.000
This is only the beginning.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.300
This is only beginning there.

13:09.400 --> 13:16.400
We're going to be mining for memes in the Jewish mines for a while and it'll be great.

13:16.800 --> 13:25.900
But you made some you made a claim earlier Artemis that they were doing it before everyone got out of the got out of the system.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.500
Yeah, do you have anything to corroborate that?

13:30.700 --> 13:34.400
Yeah, I do because they had the police haven't gone into the tunnels yet.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.300
What do you mean?

13:37.900 --> 13:41.400
Let me the police have not gone into the tunnels yet.

13:41.900 --> 13:47.900
There's still fighting the the Jewish people at the temple and then trying to board up the hole.

13:48.300 --> 13:52.900
So you're saying that they're they're closing the tunnel all the tunnel entrance without actually going in themselves.

13:53.000 --> 13:53.200
Yeah.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.900
Yeah, there's no proof that they've looked at any of the tunnels they they've started filling them.

13:58.100 --> 14:02.000
So that the issue with that is is that regardless of what that there's anybody in there.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.200
They haven't looked.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.500
Well, did you find proof that they're filling them yet?

14:05.800 --> 14:06.100
Yeah.

14:06.100 --> 14:06.700
Hold on.

14:07.300 --> 14:07.900
No problem.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.700
Give them a minute.

14:09.900 --> 14:16.100
You know me, you know me results come up when I look for Jewish tunnels and concrete Hamas is still a thing, right?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.500
No, I know I get it.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.200
They learn from the best.

14:21.200 --> 14:21.800
That's how they learn.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.300
Oh God.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.200
There's a Hogwarts meme of the the first movie.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.600
The tunnels and the ring into the house pretty funny.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.000
I thought you shouldn't know and then passes out.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.600
Yeah, here's some some the WIC community members suggestion the Juni to the center of the earth.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.900
No, that's pretty bad game.

14:38.000 --> 14:38.300
Okay.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.300
Did I even like it when it pops through my thing?

14:44.200 --> 14:44.600
Okay.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.900
Well, it's usually something I like when when I see it, but I'll try to find it and give it to you.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.400
Sure.

14:50.800 --> 14:56.900
What I actually came on here for please is to ask wick that some things and then maybe dev can chime in later.

14:57.400 --> 15:18.400
Okay, if you have a process that leads to a guilty verdict that was founded upon corrupt methods and driving evidence through corrupt methods in illegal in illegal ways with the verdict should the verdict stand.

15:20.500 --> 15:27.000
Well, when you phrase it like that, no fruit from the poison tree there are reasons why the method is important.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.700
Like for example, Bill Cosby Bill Cosby.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.600
He probably is guilty of what he did.

15:32.600 --> 15:43.500
Okay, let's not mince words, but what they did to get the verdict like how they extracted his testimony violated his rights.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.100
And so we can't let that stand.

15:46.600 --> 15:50.300
Yeah, so do you know here's a another question and then I'll get the actual point.

15:50.600 --> 15:56.200
Do you know the difference between White House Council and Special Counsel is not not taught my head.

15:56.200 --> 15:56.400
Nope.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.000
So White House Council is the council directly for the president.

16:00.000 --> 16:19.000
So the attorney the attorney directly to the president sure a special counsel is a an attorney that has been selected by the DOJ or appointed by the or whoever in through their through the systems method to have a like immunity from interference to go after a certain thing or whatever.

16:19.600 --> 16:19.900
Right?

16:19.900 --> 16:22.000
Those are two very different things.

16:22.000 --> 16:22.600
Okay, right.

16:23.100 --> 16:37.800
Okay, so I got a question for you for the Fulton County DA Fannie Willis who has a point who apparently appointed her inexperienced lover as the lead prosecutor for Donald Trump's Rico case.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.100
What do you think about that?

16:42.700 --> 16:45.200
I don't know what think about it friend.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.200
I can't comment on it until I look into it, right?

16:48.300 --> 16:51.100
Like if you're just saying that it is like this is filed.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.400
Is it nepotism?

16:52.400 --> 16:54.300
Are you is that the accusation here?

16:54.800 --> 17:00.100
Well, definitely it would be nepotism because there are several hundred different lawyers and attorneys.

17:00.100 --> 17:18.100
Sure, but when we talk about like corrupt processes, yeah, I don't that's that's not what I mean, right them appointing a their cousin or brother or something to be the council that is an ethics violation and probably should be looked or potentially one I should say it could be looked into.

17:18.600 --> 17:23.400
But I don't think it violates anyone's rights or affects the evidence.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.300
None of that.

17:24.500 --> 17:24.900
What do you think?

17:24.900 --> 17:25.600
What happens?

17:27.100 --> 17:28.200
Okay, go ahead Dev.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.000
Let's hear it.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.100
Hold on.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.600
No, you go ahead.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.100
Give me a second.

17:32.400 --> 17:32.600
Okay.

17:32.600 --> 17:45.100
So the second part is going to be what if that person that was that is the lover that is inexperienced meets with the White House counsel during their prosecution investigation.

17:46.100 --> 17:50.300
Um, look, I don't I don't know how normal that is.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.100
Biden's attorneys.

17:51.100 --> 17:54.100
Sure, but I don't know if that's a that's necessary.

17:54.100 --> 17:58.600
Like don't the the adversarial attorneys meet all the time to discuss courtship.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.100
Is that?

17:59.100 --> 18:01.400
No, no, no, you're making this is not an app.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
This is not an adversarial.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.600
This is not Trump's White House counsel.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.900
This is the Biden administration's White House counsel.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.200
Okay, what's wrong with that?

18:10.900 --> 18:12.900
Yeah, that's not that's not that's not legal.

18:13.700 --> 18:23.900
Oh, I understand but because it'd be coordinating with the political opponents to prosecute somebody.

18:23.900 --> 18:29.200
That's what would be the illusion of it because for a fair trial, right?

18:29.400 --> 18:35.400
You're supposed to avoid even the like image of corruption and bias.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.000
Right?

18:37.000 --> 18:37.300
Huh?

18:38.000 --> 18:38.400
Okay.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.700
This is well and true beyond that at the at this point in time.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.500
I'll have to look into it.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.800
I'll have to get more information on that.

18:47.800 --> 18:56.000
But yeah, if it if it was an ethics violation or if it was illegal, it was criminal should be prosecuted and should be looked into and it could affect the ruling.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.800
Absolutely.

18:57.000 --> 18:57.600
Oh stupid.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.100
Oh, it's the wick wick.

18:59.100 --> 19:02.000
I sent you an article you can just read it really quickly here.

19:02.400 --> 19:11.300
Trump co-defendant alleges improper relationship between Fannie Willis and fellow Georgia prosecutor in a filing seeking to dismiss the charges.

19:11.500 --> 19:16.200
Michael Roman's attorney accused Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade of having a romantic relationship.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.700
This is what you're talking about, right?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.700
It's not an accusation.

19:19.700 --> 19:34.600
They it's almost confirmed that the reason why it's almost it's an accusation now is because they have to unseal a document that was sealed recently that was talking about how Fannie's had a Willis had a relationship with that person.

19:35.000 --> 19:35.600
Right, right.

19:36.000 --> 19:47.500
In a 39 page filing seeking dismissal of charges an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman made accusations that Willis and Wade have traveled together destinations including Napa Valley and they've been seen together in Atlanta in a personal capacity.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.600
And this is about the lover accusation.

19:50.700 --> 19:51.100
Yeah.

19:51.100 --> 19:51.500
Well, yes.

19:51.500 --> 19:59.000
This is the lead prosecutor that Fannie Willis has appointed who is also apparently her lover that she's having an affair with.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.900
Like I'm more interested in the other thing though the meeting with the Biden Council or whatever.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.400
Yeah, that's in the

20:06.200 --> 20:08.100
Yeah, if you have that you can just look at that too.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.200
I think I do.

20:09.200 --> 20:09.600
Hold on.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.700
Yeah, because I sent it to you.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.100
You should.

20:11.100 --> 20:11.700
Yes.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.100
Again, this is again, yeah, I'll send this to you as well.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.900
Like this is again a Twitter headline.

20:16.900 --> 20:23.300
So it's always good to look beyond Twitter headlines and actually look at some things a bit more deeply, but it's a good place to start a conversation.

20:23.300 --> 20:35.300
Yeah, Nathan Wade Fannie Willis is the lead prosecutor met with Biden's White House Council on May 23rd and November 18th 2022 before indicting Donald Trump.

20:36.600 --> 20:42.100
Yeah, so this is not the special council that was in charge of actually investigating him for crimes.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.700
This is the White House Council, which is Biden's representatives.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.400
So he has no reason to even talk to them at all.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.800
So so this seems like before Fannie Willis.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.100
Yes, appointed Nathan Wade as part of the Georgia Rico case.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.500
That's what's going on here, right before that even happened.

21:02.700 --> 21:03.000
Correct.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.500
He had already met with the White House Council, which is why personal the personal loyal lawyer to the president.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.200
Yeah, why would he have any capacity be talking to them?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.100
I don't know.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.600
Well, I guess yes.

21:14.900 --> 21:19.500
So the answer is he doesn't have any actual official reason to be talking.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.700
So what do you what do you find?

21:21.800 --> 21:29.000
Well, one, the Fannie Willis is was coordinating to bring prosecution to Trump in Georgia.

21:29.500 --> 21:37.700
She had a boyfriend who was not well known to to anybody in the public who she could send as a proxy to go talk to them.

21:37.900 --> 21:46.900
And then she appointed him as the lead prosecutor in the case because one, it's your boyfriend to they they share the money that he makes from the prosecution.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.700
Who they've they've already stated that in the allegations.

21:51.000 --> 22:00.200
So this is all true, but it's also conceivable that you would have people working on the Georgia Rico case also talking to the president's office.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.600
That also makes sense.

22:01.900 --> 22:09.000
This guy before this guy ever was appointed and he has no experience prosecuting hardly at all anybody.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.900
OK, he had no reason.

22:10.900 --> 22:11.200
Hold on.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.500
Isn't isn't he an attorney?

22:12.800 --> 22:15.600
He like before he's an attorney, right?

22:15.700 --> 22:17.500
Yeah, but not all attorneys do prosecutions, man.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.700
OK, let's see what he's doing or high or high level ones for that matter.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.600
Let's look him up.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.800
What's his work history?

22:24.100 --> 22:24.400
Yep.

22:25.200 --> 22:29.400
Yeah, I mean, like you have to have a first case at some point, right?

22:29.400 --> 22:30.900
Like you have to have a hold on.

22:31.100 --> 22:35.700
You don't you don't you don't you don't send a brand new person to prosecute the former president of the United States.

22:35.700 --> 22:36.500
This is not going to happen.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.300
Apparently did.

22:39.000 --> 22:39.400
Yeah.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.600
Who is Nathan Wade Fulton special special prosecutor?

22:42.600 --> 22:43.500
Let's see what he's done.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.100
He's a special prosecutor.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.500
He works in private practice.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.200
He's a defense attorney and a one time municipal court judge.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.800
Suburban Atlanta firm.

22:52.800 --> 22:58.500
Wade and Campbell focuses on personal injury cases, contract litigation, family and domestic law and criminal defense.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.400
A graduate of John Marshall Law School.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.700
He was an assistant.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.700
He was an assistant solicitor for Cobb County in 1999.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.500
Yeah, the office that handles misdemeanor cases.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.800
He became Marietta's first black male judge in 20, not black, black and male, you know, black and male judge in 2011.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.500
He was appointed to a post in the city's municipal court.

23:20.700 --> 23:26.900
He he tried to run for higher judge offices because those are elected in this location and he did not win.

23:27.200 --> 23:27.500
Yep.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.000
You don't need any type of credentials to be elected to as a to a judge.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.400
It's got it's a populated contest.

23:33.700 --> 23:34.000
Yeah.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.000
So that so being a judge.

23:36.100 --> 23:49.300
He was in 2020, he was retained by Cobb Sheriff Neil Warren to review complaints of use of force, racial biases, discrimination, neglect at the county jail after seven detainees died in custody.

23:51.400 --> 23:56.500
So basically, he is a lawyer and he's held like a bunch of small time positions.

23:56.800 --> 24:05.300
So you can say that him him being raised to this high profile job by what seems to be his girlfriend is improper.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.300
That makes sense.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.000
Right.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.500
But hold on, hold on.

24:08.800 --> 24:14.400
But that being said, him meeting with the White House is not necessarily improper.

24:14.700 --> 24:15.100
It is.

24:15.900 --> 24:17.700
Why is he one?

24:18.100 --> 24:22.800
You don't meet with the political opponent of a person you're going to indict.

24:23.400 --> 24:34.300
That that's not something you want to do as a prosecutor if you're going to prosecute a case because then you are opening up the door for reversible error in terms of bias prosecutorial malice possible.

24:34.300 --> 24:34.900
That's possible.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.300
That's why you know, that's why you avoid it.

24:37.900 --> 24:39.500
OK, you do it outright.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.300
You avoid that.

24:40.500 --> 24:55.500
You find somebody who's not connected to anybody and you select them as the lead prosecutor to avoid these things because this is a a the very minimal stepping stone for a fair trial because the defense is going to tear your part if they find it.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
That that's what it sounds like.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.600
It sounds like they'll get they'll get torn apart in court then, but what else is there?

25:01.400 --> 25:01.900
What do you mean?

25:02.300 --> 25:02.700
What do you mean?

25:02.700 --> 25:03.900
We said you said one.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.800
Is there any other reason why this is bad?

25:06.500 --> 25:06.900
Yes.

25:06.900 --> 25:29.900
So if the if the person is going to a before having even being anointed as a special prosecutor and they're going to a the White House counsel to talk to Biden's representative, that means that there was already an intent to put them in as the special prosecutor ahead of time.

25:30.500 --> 25:38.700
So that this is pre-planning in coordination by the administration with Fannie Willis ahead of time to to put a problem with that.

25:38.700 --> 25:44.200
Oh, yeah, you're not you're not an inexperienced prosecutor on the case.

25:44.800 --> 25:54.000
They hatched the plot to meet with him before and do what coordinate coordinate prosecutions across multiple states.

25:54.900 --> 25:59.700
I just why would I will I don't understand the motivation other than

26:00.100 --> 26:02.900
I want this guy to be the prosecutor because I'm sleeping with them.

26:04.300 --> 26:04.600
Why?

26:04.600 --> 26:05.000
Okay.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.100
I don't understand why there has to be any deeper meeting than these people are.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.200
Well, because you came in right?

26:10.200 --> 26:16.800
Yeah, you came in and you say should these things stand when they've their corrupt processes of violate people's rights.

26:16.900 --> 26:24.200
My answer that is no, but then I look at to okay, this is this is yeah, this is probably improper.

26:24.200 --> 26:29.500
If what you're saying is correct, if what you're saying is correct, it's probably improper, but I don't I don't know if it.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.500
Okay, so anything to the case, right?

26:32.800 --> 26:43.400
So if you have some again, it goes back to a biased prosecutor prosecutorial.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.600
We call malfeasance.

26:44.900 --> 26:45.600
Okay charge.

26:45.600 --> 26:49.700
I mean, maybe it's like I said, I'm not a legal scholar and I don't know much about the law.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.700
I don't know much about the legal processes.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.800
You could be absolutely correct here.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.500
I just as a layman as someone just looking into these things.

26:57.700 --> 27:01.100
It just doesn't it doesn't set off too many alarms other than yeah.

27:01.100 --> 27:01.400
Okay.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
They had their friend.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.600
I understand that.

27:03.600 --> 27:08.600
I understand that normal corruption in like Democratic areas is going to not set off alarms.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.700
But when you already have hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:11.700 --> 27:12.300
Let me finish.

27:12.300 --> 27:12.600
Go ahead.

27:12.600 --> 27:12.900
Go ahead.

27:12.900 --> 27:13.100
Go ahead.

27:13.100 --> 27:24.000
We have Fannie Willis nepotistically appointing an inexperienced and unqualified attorney to being a prosecutor for which he has no prosecutorial background.

27:24.800 --> 27:46.000
As the lead prosecutor with unlimited power as a special prosecutor, okay against a former president of the United States when he had met with the president's political enemies before this you are now in so far into the get rid of this fucking guy and replace him with somebody better.

27:47.400 --> 27:53.700
And at the very start that should have been the start thing but they went in have done all of this and then charged him and now I'm going to trial.

27:54.200 --> 28:02.700
This is irreversible error because now you're showing that the system and the people in power are too biased to have followed proper conduct.

28:02.700 --> 28:12.500
Well, then if our legal system is working and if what you're saying is correct, it's going to be a kind of an own goal on the prosecution side.

28:12.500 --> 28:18.100
It is and this is the issue is that yeah, but like I said, I don't I don't know.

28:18.500 --> 28:23.100
I think that's evidence that the system is working and I don't know.

28:23.100 --> 28:23.600
I don't know.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.300
Does that make sense?

28:24.300 --> 28:28.900
At least that like, okay, they did something really stupid and they're going to be punished in court for it.

28:29.500 --> 28:38.900
So this is the like at this is the this is the same Fulton County that has been stonewalling a ballot case for three years now.

28:38.900 --> 28:41.300
Don't just bring up another fucking thing man.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.800
Like come on but but this is true and you can't argue.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.100
Okay.

28:44.100 --> 28:44.600
Sure.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.000
It's true, but it's unrelated.

28:46.400 --> 28:46.800
Okay.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.500
I'm just saying this is right here.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.100
I have a question to ask you at the start of this.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.300
Okay, I do have a question.

28:51.300 --> 28:55.300
So what you've what you've brought here seems to be two separate things.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.400
Okay, go ahead.

28:56.800 --> 29:04.500
And the first one is Fannie Willis appoints her boyfriend who and she is a public figure.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.600
He is not she is kind of well known.

29:07.600 --> 29:16.300
He really isn't that well known his career what he's done in his career does not seem to warrant him be him being given this this huge position.

29:16.900 --> 29:20.800
And so it seems like it's an it she has improperly appointed him.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.000
That seems to be true from what we have.

29:23.000 --> 29:23.400
All right.

29:23.400 --> 29:23.800
All right.

29:24.200 --> 29:33.000
However, the the second part of the second thing that you have here is why did this guy meet with the White House legal team, right?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.800
Those are two those are two separate questions.

29:34.800 --> 29:51.100
So for example, if it turns out that he actually has completely good reasons for meeting with the White House legal team like what hold on if that were the case then the first the first problem which is he got appointed nepotistically.

29:51.300 --> 29:54.300
That isn't enough and shouldn't be enough to throw the entire case out, right?

29:54.600 --> 29:55.000
Mm hmm.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.900
Maybe no, no, hold on.

29:58.500 --> 30:09.500
It would throw him and Fannie Willis off the case and probably be put under a different County da to coordinate and redo the entire thing because you're true because that's probably true.

30:09.500 --> 30:20.600
Yes, everything everything in its case at the moment would be under suspect and judges would be really really hesitant to touch it unless they like it's been gone through with a fine to come.

30:21.100 --> 30:25.700
Yeah, I don't you mean like they might say okay, like you two are clearly corrupt and you're scratching each other's backs.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.900
We're going to get different prosecutors and like you guys are gone.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.400
So that might be the case.

30:29.400 --> 30:37.400
Yes, but in terms of disqualifying the whole thing solely because she brought her her boyfriend on board.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.400
I don't see that being legitimate frankly.

30:39.800 --> 30:50.300
Now the real question this is why I think with you were on that you're on the money is that the real question is why did he meet with the White House because I do think that there are actually good reasons as to why a person in his

30:50.300 --> 31:02.200
position might do so well if you are prosecuting Trump and there might be legitimate information to let me finish it.

31:02.200 --> 31:09.400
I let you finish things there might be legitimate information to come out of Biden himself or from other people working at the White House or from the White House office.

31:09.700 --> 31:17.300
It seems reasonable that the prosecutor would go to people involved which includes people at the White House and ask them about it.

31:17.700 --> 31:23.000
Yeah, so though that's that's kind of post hoc because this was he was he went there beforehand.

31:23.000 --> 31:23.400
Sure.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.800
He was even as a prosecutor.

31:25.800 --> 31:30.900
But you're alleging that there can be no other reason than malfeasance for this to happen.

31:30.900 --> 31:37.700
That is what you were you were kind of implying with your statements that the only reason that they could have a meeting is for corruption.

31:38.000 --> 31:43.800
And if there are other reasons where it would be legitimate like Dev said yes, it's post hoc.

31:43.800 --> 31:50.900
But the fact is we were how we're all having to like post hoc this because none of us have the information of what they were actually meeting about.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.800
I'm not privy to those are at information.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.600
Are you?

31:54.800 --> 31:56.500
No, that's just what you avoid doing.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.700
He's speculating.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.300
We're all speculating.

31:59.400 --> 32:08.600
We're all making guesses about what may or may not have and our biases obviously will make us lean one way or the other now again.

32:09.100 --> 32:15.300
What should happen is they should be forthwith and like tell people right?

32:15.300 --> 32:18.800
I'm all for more transparency and all these processes, right?

32:18.800 --> 32:23.600
And so unless it violates some kind of national security risk, which it might or anything.

32:24.100 --> 32:29.000
I think it's perfectly fine to release the logs of the meetings and things like that.

32:29.000 --> 32:38.300
So so when a person is anointed through nepotistic and corrupt methods, it is not up to the people launching an issue with it to have to then prove that his

32:38.300 --> 32:44.500
meeting with somebody he was he's not supposed to meet with would ever be anything other than proper.

32:44.700 --> 32:54.800
Okay, it is up to the person that was corruptly anointed to show that their meeting was above board, which can be done through minutes or communication.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.400
I guess we'll see if it is or not.

32:56.700 --> 33:02.300
That's not that's not up to the people having an issue with a clearly ethics violation.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.100
His issue to reveal that to isn't to you.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.000
It's to the no, no, no, it is it.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
No, it's to everybody.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.600
That would be why, why, why, why, why, why, what, what obligation does he have to tell you shit, right?

33:14.600 --> 33:17.900
Like you want to know, well, you're on the jury.

33:18.100 --> 33:19.200
You're not in the county.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.400
I don't believe right.

33:20.500 --> 33:24.200
Is he he was selected as a public official.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.800
So he is now when he is as a running as working as a public official.

33:28.800 --> 33:37.900
He is now held to the standard of public officials, which is recording those things and then keeping that sure and releasing it to the people who need

33:37.900 --> 33:45.200
to know, right, which in this case would be the court system, the judges involved in the case and the public.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.800
It was because those things are publicly filed.

33:46.800 --> 33:47.200
Yes.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.700
So hold on, hold on, hold on.

33:49.100 --> 33:52.000
This also seems kind of post hoc, though, Artemis.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.300
Why?

33:53.100 --> 34:01.200
So what as as you said earlier, when he he talked to he went to the White House in May and then again in November, right?

34:01.400 --> 34:02.700
He hadn't been appointed.

34:03.700 --> 34:08.100
He hadn't been appointed this in this public council position yet, right?

34:08.100 --> 34:10.600
Yes, which is the issue, right?

34:11.300 --> 34:25.100
So it could be the case that they knew they were going to appoint him and the and she sent him along to do some sort of secret talks, hoping that it wouldn't come up and said, you know, I'm going to point you in a few months.

34:25.100 --> 34:30.700
You go do this right now and that, you know, even as described, that could be OK, depending.

34:30.700 --> 34:31.200
I'm not sure.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.700
However, sure, it's not OK.

34:34.200 --> 34:38.800
We have secret talks when you're when you're working as a in your official capacity as a prosecutor.

34:39.300 --> 34:39.700
He wasn't.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.100
No, no, no, he wasn't working.

34:41.100 --> 34:41.600
No, no, no, no.

34:42.000 --> 34:42.500
That's the point.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.600
And he wasn't working.

34:44.100 --> 34:45.400
He wasn't working in a capacity.

34:45.600 --> 34:45.900
Hold on.

34:45.900 --> 34:46.800
Fanny was can't.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.400
Fanny Willis can't send him to do that in a secret way.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.300
That's that.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.200
But it would be her problem, not his.

34:53.200 --> 34:53.800
It would be her problem.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.200
Not his.

34:54.200 --> 35:01.000
Yeah, but it's but it's OK, but it still comes back to affecting the case because she said to me clandestinely to go talk to the political.

35:01.700 --> 35:05.300
The enemy political enemy of the person getting prosecuted.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.100
Well, all I'm hearing from this is I got to find someone that I can sleep with.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.800
That'll suit me to the moon.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.800
That will get me into the big leagues.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.100
Who do I got to sleep with?

35:16.100 --> 35:17.100
Is that how it is?

35:17.500 --> 35:21.300
Apparently, apparently, according to so here's the thing, right?

35:21.300 --> 35:28.300
Like because he did this before actually working in an official capacity, it could be have been for anything.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.800
And that's really the point here, right?

35:30.400 --> 35:36.700
Which is why you avoid ever having brought him into the prosecutorial position in the first place.

35:37.800 --> 35:45.000
Well, I think actually that brings up a problem because now you're saying I can't bring in any lawyer who has ever talked to the president because someone might dig through it and discover that.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.200
Sure, that's you have an infinite amount of lawyers.

35:49.200 --> 35:53.100
You can pull through across the country for being an infinite amount of lawyers.

35:53.700 --> 36:00.900
I mean, here, here, how about he had other reasons to go to like work-related reasons to go to the White House.

36:02.900 --> 36:09.500
Okay, so hypothetically, let's say he has work-related reasons to go to the White House for some other case or some other instance or something else going on, right?

36:10.000 --> 36:16.100
And so he has those two meetings and then he gets hired nepotistically by his girlfriend, right?

36:16.100 --> 36:22.800
Now that makes it that makes not his meetings the problem, but the nepotistic hiring the problem, right?

36:23.100 --> 36:30.200
All right, I'm going to make this a really easy one for you to understand and there was a wrap this up after this because we do have more people in line.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.600
Do you remember a infamous tarmac meeting?

36:33.700 --> 36:38.800
Which one the Loretta Lynch Clinton meeting was that?

36:38.800 --> 36:44.800
No, I don't you got to remind me of this where they decided that I'm pretty sure it hold on.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.100
Let me let me bring it up that way.

36:54.100 --> 37:00.500
I guess what I'm saying, I guess what I'm saying basically Artemis is that everything that you're saying is possible.

37:00.500 --> 37:05.100
It is more likely than but we do not have enough evidence for it yet.

37:05.100 --> 37:08.100
And now I want to see more evidence for it, but it is possible.

37:08.100 --> 37:22.400
Yes, so I'll send you the the Loretta Lynch Clinton story about the meeting on the tarmac without for no reason apparently, but that, you know, people can claim is above board and that nothing happened.

37:22.600 --> 37:33.300
But the the the resulting actions after that meeting led to a reversing in the expected outcomes of cases.

37:35.600 --> 37:41.200
So also the the person broke the story ended up dead, but that's that's a different reason.

37:41.200 --> 37:49.500
There's all these implications and everything you're saying is like, oh, and also they ended up dead.

37:49.500 --> 37:56.600
I wonder why I mean that I know why, but isn't it weird that he ended up dead?

37:56.600 --> 37:57.800
Isn't it weird?

37:57.800 --> 38:11.600
But there is the issue is that the there's the tarmac meeting is a really good example of where people would have to recuse themselves regardless of what was talked about on that plane on the tarmac.

38:11.600 --> 38:23.200
The you cannot have somebody in any fashion overseeing a case when the person that the case is involved is the person you like representative you talk to on a plane where no one else could hear it.

38:24.400 --> 38:28.000
Well, tell you what, Artemis, thank you for bringing this to my attention.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.900
I'll check it out because again, I don't want to take your word for it.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.700
I wouldn't take Dev's word for it or anyone's on the Internet's word for it.

38:34.700 --> 38:43.100
I'll look into some some more check out some articles, see what they got and see if I can't find if there's any more information out there.

38:43.100 --> 38:45.400
But I do appreciate you calling in, buddy.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.200
Thanks for coming by.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.000
And for now, though.

38:50.800 --> 38:57.800
I'll send you away, send you to the void, as I say, I think you get a chance to reply to that last thing.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.500
Well, what did you want to say?

38:59.900 --> 39:05.100
I guess the TLDR is that the things that Artemis present sometimes are just crazy.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.700
There's other conversations we've had where he's just I think he's just been wrong.

39:08.100 --> 39:12.100
But like this, this is possible, but there's not enough evidence.

39:12.100 --> 39:12.600
We have to wait.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.900
That's all you're going to lose your right wing cred, buddy.

39:15.900 --> 39:21.900
Like people tell people tell me that you're this crypto tanky guy.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.200
Thank you.

39:23.200 --> 39:23.600
Right.

39:23.600 --> 39:23.900
All right.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.700
Maybe a crypto communist.

39:25.900 --> 39:26.500
Well, thank you.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.500
Your communist is anyone who goes for Biden and certain people.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.200
OK, right.

39:30.500 --> 39:36.200
So, you know, like so not believing the conspiracy theory right off the bat.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.100
What are you doing?

39:37.100 --> 39:38.000
What's going on?

39:38.900 --> 39:40.000
But gang?

39:40.300 --> 39:40.500
Yeah.

39:40.500 --> 39:45.700
If you want to call in, if you'd like to talk to us about something, it could be political.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.700
It could be cultural, could be anything you'd like.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.700
Hit the Discord link.

39:50.700 --> 39:52.200
I'll put it in chats.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.900
Escalation board, Discord and the Twitch chat.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.900
Click the link, accept the rules, jump backstage, we'll pull you on.

39:57.900 --> 39:58.900
Let's get to our next caller.

39:58.900 --> 40:00.600
Whoa, they were here.

40:01.000 --> 40:01.800
They were here just a minute ago.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.200
There was people here, but then they vanished.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.900
Because they got they got impatient.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.500
And this is what happens, right?

40:08.600 --> 40:13.200
They get in, they want to call and then they're like, oh, man, this is taking too long.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.000
And then they'll just dip.

40:14.100 --> 40:14.700
Oh, there we go.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.300
Here we go.

40:16.700 --> 40:17.700
Allison, hello.

40:20.900 --> 40:21.600
You're live.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.400
Can you hear me?

40:23.900 --> 40:25.000
I can hear you.

40:25.000 --> 40:25.300
Hi.

40:26.300 --> 40:26.800
Hi.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.800
I don't have the camera today, if that's okay.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.200
That's, no one has the camera in, except for me in this place.

40:32.200 --> 40:32.700
So go ahead.

40:34.100 --> 40:44.100
Okay, well, okay, I listen to NPR Up First every morning, and I listen to the Daily Wire's shameless ripoff of NPR Up First every morning.

40:44.100 --> 40:51.100
Okay, so I get the little like mainstream right and left daily news perspectives and like, I'm subscribed to the times.

40:51.100 --> 40:55.000
And I'm just like seeing constant reports about immigration all of a sudden.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.600
I know it's always a big issue.

40:56.900 --> 41:12.600
But I swear the last like five weeks, I just see article after article about like, Democrat mayor is pissed off about immigration, like New York suing bus companies that complied with Abbott's orders, like Biden suing to cut the razor wire in Texas.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.300
He previously sued to get the floating barriers.

41:15.300 --> 41:24.000
But it's like one after, I don't know if I'm just like maybe on alert for it because these fucking commenters keep telling me it's really going to affect the election in 2024.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.500
This is going to be a big fucking deal.

41:25.700 --> 41:29.400
I don't know if the priming has worked or whatever, but I just like keep noticing it.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.900
Is this like a real thing or what's going on?

41:33.100 --> 41:40.600
I mean, immigration has been a hot button issue since Build the Wall in 2016, right?

41:40.600 --> 41:42.100
Like, or even before then.

41:42.800 --> 41:48.000
So I don't, yeah, it absolutely is something that is a political football that's going to be tossed around.

41:48.500 --> 41:52.700
There's people going to have big hyperbolic takes on it.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.200
And there's more and more lawsuits, like more and more legal action.

41:56.200 --> 42:01.800
I don't think it's just people talking like I think like shit is happening in courts more and more.

42:02.900 --> 42:03.500
What do you mean?

42:04.500 --> 42:12.800
Like, okay, so New York did just sue all those bus companies that complied with Abbott's busing efforts to sanctuary cities.

42:13.100 --> 42:19.000
So the implication there is that they're trying to like stop private companies from like complying with the Texas governor's order.

42:19.400 --> 42:29.200
In the past, Biden successfully, or his administration successfully sued to get the floating barriers in the Rio Grande removed, calling them an environmental hazard.

42:29.400 --> 42:34.900
He's currently suing to cut the razor wire border on Texas.

42:35.100 --> 42:51.700
And then also Texas recently criminalized crossing the border illegally on the state level, which would give Texas state cops the ability to like detain suspected illegal border crossers and like deport them or like refer them to ICE for deportation.

42:52.300 --> 43:02.300
And so Biden's like, it's like, specifically, there's more and more legal fights between Greg Abbott and Biden's administration or related parties like the state of New York.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.700
But it's just interesting to me.

43:05.700 --> 43:09.100
It's like an interesting little I don't know.

43:10.300 --> 43:16.900
You know, I don't understand why Americans are weird about their borders, like most other countries are like, oh, yeah, you can't come through.

43:17.500 --> 43:18.700
That's just how it is.

43:19.100 --> 43:22.400
How come there's so much for a second?

43:22.400 --> 43:23.700
Can you repeat that last thing?

43:24.000 --> 43:24.700
Okay, sure, sure.

43:25.500 --> 43:35.100
I don't understand why Americans are weird about their borders because in every other country, it's like, yeah, you can't come into the country without going through a proper border crossing and you can't just can't just jump the border.

43:35.300 --> 43:37.200
That's normal everywhere else.

43:37.400 --> 43:44.600
Why is it that when it comes to the American Mexican border, you have people screaming that it's somehow racist to build a wall?

43:44.700 --> 43:45.700
It's like, what the fuck?

43:45.700 --> 43:47.900
Like other countries have walls is no big deal.

43:47.900 --> 43:49.500
Like what's what's going on here?

43:51.800 --> 44:03.300
I mean, I mean, also another steel man, the other side, they'd be like, well, we don't want that even though it's normal in other countries, like it's normal in other countries to pressure a population, right?

44:03.600 --> 44:04.300
Do we want that?

44:04.300 --> 44:05.400
Obviously not.

44:05.900 --> 44:07.600
We could look at the EU, right?

44:07.600 --> 44:20.700
In other multinational conglomerates, if you will, that have treaties that allow free movement between countries without any of these border restrictions and things like that.

44:20.700 --> 44:27.100
So while yes, in many countries, it is normalized to have a straight, strict border security.

44:27.300 --> 44:28.300
That's not the case everywhere.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.800
Yeah, but I mean, Americans don't have that kind of news.

44:33.500 --> 44:41.500
Oh, sorry, the Republicans have tied Israel and Ukraine aid to like a certain number of what they would say is common sense immigration reform.

44:41.700 --> 44:48.300
Other people would say really conservative, harsh, harsh on people who are just trying to make it for themselves and their children.

44:48.600 --> 44:49.500
So it like depends.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.100
But that's another thing that's happening right now.

44:53.100 --> 44:56.400
Well, I mean, if you wanted to start cutting deals, that's how you would do it, right?

44:56.400 --> 44:59.100
It's like the conservatives want something, the liberals want something else.

44:59.900 --> 45:00.800
You make a deal.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.700
You reduce immigration, you get more aid.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.200
I mean, it seems like it's a fair trade.

45:06.700 --> 45:16.600
I feel like the Democrats, I mean, again, maybe I'm like buying the hype because all these like commentariat people keep implying that like the Democrats will probably be electorally punished for this.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.700
Like this doesn't seem to be very popular.

45:18.700 --> 45:25.500
Apparently, immigration is the issue that Biden consistently polls lowest in terms of confidence for voters.

45:25.500 --> 45:26.000
We did have it.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.100
It's like, are you sure about that?

45:28.700 --> 45:31.200
Because I'm pretty sure it would be Israel-Palestine at this point.

45:32.200 --> 45:37.700
Oh, I don't think it's like the top one, but it's amongst the top like three, I think, immigration is.

45:38.600 --> 45:42.100
Well, but I don't know that it's like number one, least confident.

45:42.100 --> 45:48.600
To that point, there was a recent poll out where I guess Biden's approval rating is only at 38%.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.000
It's very, very low.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.600
And it is an issue, right?

45:52.900 --> 46:03.400
I think Biden's low approval numbers are going to have an impact going forward, but I don't think it's caused to panic as of yet.

46:03.400 --> 46:11.000
I think this might change going into the general as one, the economy gets better and continues to improve, right?

46:11.000 --> 46:15.100
There's a lot of really good signs that the economy is trending upward right now.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.400
But yeah, we'll have to see.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.900
There's some signs that might be trending downward, though.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
I mean, I've heard that layoffs are coming in the next six months, like big layoffs are coming.

46:28.100 --> 46:30.500
Oh, so they might come in the future.

46:30.500 --> 46:35.500
Maybe, but like I believe it was the Wall Street Journal.

46:35.600 --> 46:44.400
I could be wrong on who reported this, but in December wage increase surpassed inflation increase, right?

46:44.400 --> 46:48.400
And that's been something that's been underwater since COVID for a long time.

46:48.900 --> 46:51.900
And it's now kind of finally kind of surpassed that.

46:51.900 --> 46:54.300
So it's not entirely fixed yet.

46:54.300 --> 46:55.900
There are still some big problems.

46:56.600 --> 47:03.900
But again, trends that I'm seeing are all pointing to things are going to get better.

47:03.900 --> 47:06.400
Now, will that actually affect his poll numbers?

47:06.700 --> 47:07.800
We'll see, right?

47:08.200 --> 47:15.200
And when it comes to immigration to your topic, Alison, I don't know.

47:15.200 --> 47:20.700
Like, I don't know if that's going to be the big issue of 2024.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.200
I really don't, but I could be wrong.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.300
We shall see.

47:25.500 --> 47:26.000
We shall see.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.500
Is there anything else you have for us today?

47:29.300 --> 47:30.400
No, that's really it.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.400
I see you have the line again, so I'll let you go.

47:33.500 --> 47:35.700
Okay, Alison, thank you for calling in.

47:36.100 --> 47:36.800
And I will talk to you.

47:36.800 --> 47:37.300
Bye.

47:38.000 --> 47:38.400
Bye.

47:41.100 --> 47:44.900
Yeah, so what other signs, just before bringing the next caller, I'm just curious.

47:44.900 --> 47:49.800
Other than the layouts, what other signs do you see that the economy is getting worse?

47:50.700 --> 47:51.500
That was the main one.

47:51.800 --> 47:52.200
That was it.

47:52.200 --> 47:52.500
Fair enough.

47:53.500 --> 47:54.500
It might be true, right?

47:54.500 --> 47:58.600
Like, we can only guess at the future.

47:58.700 --> 47:59.400
We'll have to see.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.300
Five dollars from Artemis Fowl says, Wick, tell people about the Muslim Uber driver I told you about.

48:04.300 --> 48:04.800
I will.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.900
We're going to let some callers get in and get stories in too, though, right?

48:08.100 --> 48:09.600
This is a community event.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.800
Okay, but I'll tell that story if the line dies down.

48:12.800 --> 48:13.900
Let me bring in the next caller.

48:15.700 --> 48:16.600
Hello, you're live.

48:21.200 --> 48:21.600
Hello.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.700
Hello, so I have a stupid question and then I have a serious question.

48:26.300 --> 48:29.400
The stupid question is, what do you like better, Pokemon or Digimon?

48:30.500 --> 48:30.900
Hello.

48:31.700 --> 48:32.000
Hi.

48:32.300 --> 48:38.900
Hi, so I'm not that familiar with Digimon, so if I had to choose between the two, I'll go with Pokemon because it's more familiar.

48:39.100 --> 48:39.500
That's me.

48:41.200 --> 48:41.700
Hold on a second.

48:41.700 --> 48:42.100
Hold on.

48:42.100 --> 48:42.600
Hold on a second.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.800
I'm having a problem here.

48:44.000 --> 48:44.500
Give me a second.

48:45.900 --> 48:48.000
Okay, no.

48:48.000 --> 48:48.600
Hi, Sparkles.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.300
What's going on?

48:50.300 --> 48:50.700
Hi.

48:51.200 --> 48:51.900
Well, okay.

48:51.900 --> 48:55.200
So I've been seeing this word neoliberal a lot.

48:55.200 --> 48:55.800
What does it mean?

48:57.500 --> 48:58.500
That's who's saying it.

48:59.400 --> 49:03.500
Neoliberal is usually thrown around as an insult.

49:05.900 --> 49:08.400
I don't know the precise definition.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.700
Let's Wikipedia it.

49:09.700 --> 49:14.600
Okay, so neoliberalism is a term used to signify.

49:14.600 --> 49:25.300
The late 20th century political reappearance of 19th century ideas associated with free market capitalism, which had fallen into decline following the Second World War.

49:26.900 --> 49:27.400
Let's see.

49:33.700 --> 49:37.000
All I know is that if someone calls me a neoliberal, they're not wishing me.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.500
Well, okay, they're not one by you piece of shit.

49:41.700 --> 49:43.200
Neoliberal shit.

49:44.000 --> 49:53.100
One impetus for the formulation of policies to mitigate capitalist free market volatility was a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the 1930s.

49:54.200 --> 50:08.400
And policymaking neoliberalism often refers to what what often refers to what was part of a paradigm shift that followed the perceived failure of the post-war consensus and Keynesian economics to address the stagflation of the 1970s.

50:08.800 --> 50:09.000
Okay.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.800
Yeah, so so basically.

50:11.300 --> 50:17.300
From what I basically understand is after the end of the Second World War up until pretty much the 1970s.

50:17.600 --> 50:25.400
You had a lot of a lot of like Social Democrats are the ones who were paving the way in the various mainstream left-wing parties in the world.

50:25.600 --> 50:31.000
Lots of high taxation and lots of lots of lots of social spending, right?

50:31.400 --> 50:36.700
But you did that for about 30 or 40 years and the economy eventually stagnated.

50:37.000 --> 50:43.900
So you so with the neoliberals basically came in with them with Ronald Reagan and Reagan's idea was hold on, hold on, hold on.

50:43.900 --> 50:47.300
How about and we don't necessarily need to get rid of all the social spending.

50:47.300 --> 51:01.600
But how about we cut some of this regulation to allow people to be able to more easily work and companies to be built and there's more economic growth and there's more prosperity and that basically worked and was the political paradigm of the West.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.700
I think until Trump.

51:03.700 --> 51:06.300
They get lasted from Reagan to Trump neoliberals.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.900
They called Nikki Haley and neoliberal.

51:10.400 --> 51:19.900
Yeah, so so the the left will often use neoliberal as an insult towards people who maybe they have some.

51:21.300 --> 51:27.200
Some more progressive social views like on gay marriage or something like that, but ultimately they're very pro-capitalist.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.700
They're not socialists at all.

51:29.400 --> 51:45.300
So they use neoliberal as an insult and they did what they basically mean is like, you know, fake revolutionary or you know, like a capital like rainbow capitalism is also kind of related to this idea where it's like somebody who's very inclusive socially, but still ultimately a capitalist.

51:45.500 --> 51:47.600
It's like a socialist slur basically.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.300
It was a conservative guy that said it.

51:51.200 --> 51:57.200
Okay, so when conservatives use the word neoliberal as an insult, it's also not good.

51:57.200 --> 52:08.200
So when conservatives do it, they're basically saying like neoliberals are trying to appeal to the economics of the right, but they tax too high and they're too progressive for our tastes.

52:08.900 --> 52:10.400
Okay, okay, that makes sense now.

52:10.400 --> 52:10.900
Okay, thank you.

52:10.900 --> 52:13.800
Yeah, it's used as an insult by both sides.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.800
Cuz at first I was like, I don't yeah.

52:16.800 --> 52:17.200
Okay.

52:17.200 --> 52:28.500
Cuz he I cuz he would say that she wanted to be the vice president be if Trump she they want Trump to have her as a would be his vice president.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.400
I think she said she would do that if she was asked.

52:30.400 --> 52:30.800
Yeah.

52:31.700 --> 52:32.000
Yeah.

52:32.000 --> 52:32.200
Yeah.

52:32.200 --> 52:32.400
Yeah.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.800
She said yeah, but he said no.

52:33.800 --> 52:34.400
He said no.

52:34.500 --> 52:35.100
He doesn't want her.

52:35.100 --> 52:35.800
Yeah, not at all.

52:35.900 --> 52:36.100
Yeah.

52:36.300 --> 52:38.400
No, there's there's there's no fucking way that he would.

52:38.400 --> 52:38.700
Yeah.

52:38.700 --> 52:40.400
How do you Dev?

52:40.400 --> 52:43.600
How do you respond to the accusations that you're a neoliberal?

52:44.500 --> 52:47.400
I might be I mean, it sounds like here's the thing.

52:47.600 --> 52:51.500
If you look at you know, the the Golden Age of the neoliberals things are pretty good.

52:51.900 --> 52:53.300
Yeah, the nifty 90s.

52:53.300 --> 52:54.200
It was a good time.

52:54.700 --> 52:55.400
Can't complain.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
You know, if it turned out that I was just a neoliberal in the end after everything was boiled down.

53:01.200 --> 53:02.100
I'd be fine with that.

53:02.500 --> 53:03.500
I don't hate neoliberals.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.000
I think liberals hold on a bad rap in general, right?

53:08.200 --> 53:11.100
I think that more and more cry.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.200
I don't buck against the label.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.700
If you want to call me a liberal kind of okay.

53:16.700 --> 53:18.300
I'm definitely I'm definitely a liberal.

53:18.300 --> 53:18.700
Yes.

53:18.900 --> 53:20.300
Also the men it sparkles.

53:20.300 --> 53:21.000
I think sparkles.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.400
You've been watching me for years now.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.200
It's the first time we've spoken sparkles.

53:24.200 --> 53:24.800
I think it is.

53:25.500 --> 53:28.500
It is I've been saying voice messages before but we've never talked about.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.200
Oh, no, right, right.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.800
Is this a first time?

53:32.700 --> 53:33.400
No, you okay.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.900
It's not a stalker situation.

53:34.900 --> 53:35.600
Is it or no?

53:35.600 --> 53:36.100
No, it's fine.

53:36.100 --> 53:36.300
It's fine.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.000
It's okay.

53:39.600 --> 53:41.500
No, you've been watching me for years and years.

53:42.500 --> 53:48.500
So what I what I recall is there's been and you've certainly seen this sparkles.

53:48.500 --> 53:57.500
There's been so many people who get mad at me when they finally realize that I actually am a liberal and I haven't been dog-whistling this whole time.

53:58.500 --> 54:06.600
And it happens pretty regularly where it's like we you're actually a liberal and you're not you know, someone who says they're a liberal but you're actually far left or far right.

54:06.600 --> 54:09.500
It's like no, I'm not no, I'm actually a liberal.

54:10.300 --> 54:13.700
All the time I don't understand the commie you get called that all the time.

54:14.200 --> 54:14.500
Yeah.

54:14.500 --> 54:14.700
Yeah.

54:14.700 --> 54:32.500
Yeah, people who are more who are way more right-leaning than me call me communist all the time and what they mean by communist is basically somebody who is in any way even just slightly progressive socially or believes in some level of taxation that isn't zero.

54:33.500 --> 54:35.100
That's what they mean by communist.

54:36.100 --> 54:41.700
And then and then you have like you have people on Twitter or you have like BreadTubers or something.

54:41.700 --> 54:50.700
I've heard Vashj say this about me a handful of times that like I'm a fascist right or I'm alt-right or I'm some sort of not like neo-nazi or right way something right something.

54:50.700 --> 54:52.700
Yeah, crypto fascist.

54:52.700 --> 54:53.700
I thought he just called you a fatchus.

54:53.700 --> 54:54.700
A fat, what did he say?

54:54.700 --> 54:55.200
A fatchus.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.200
Yeah, a fatchus.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.200
Is that me?

55:02.200 --> 55:03.200
He's annoying anyway.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.200
Vashj.

55:04.200 --> 55:04.700
Yeah.

55:05.200 --> 55:10.700
I mean, I've heard that maybe he's he's like slightly maybe one drop de-radicalizing.

55:10.700 --> 55:11.500
I don't believe it though.

55:11.500 --> 55:16.200
But I mean, he's he's slowly he's slowly coming out of the Fortress Ark.

55:16.200 --> 55:35.000
I've had a I've had him on my stream once before generally look, he's a nice enough gentleman when you interact with him one-to-one I have substantive disagreements with I think some of the ways he handles himself but in a lot of other ways.

55:35.100 --> 55:57.800
I actually agree with him and in some ways right like I think that there is something to the to be said about critiques of capitalism and critiques of more fascistic or more right-leaning institutions and groups and things like that, but you just can't the my problem my biggest problem with him is he can't believe anything.

55:57.800 --> 56:02.000
He says you have to research it on your own because he'll just go with things.

56:02.000 --> 56:16.700
The funniest clip I saw was him reviewing the terrorist attack in Iran where they blew up a bunch of people attending this Memorial for so many.

56:16.700 --> 56:20.700
I believe it was and he's watching this and he's the whole time.

56:20.700 --> 56:22.600
He's blaming Israel like oh Israel.

56:22.600 --> 56:23.800
This has to be a girl.

56:23.800 --> 56:31.900
I'm like calling it and it's Israel Israel did this Israel did this it definitely is and then like a week later Isis takes responsibility for the attacks.

56:31.900 --> 56:36.600
And so you can't really trust him, but he's fine.

56:36.600 --> 56:37.100
I know what you mean.

56:37.100 --> 56:43.600
What about Tacoma and I live by Tacoma and Tacoma has lead in the water and lead in the water can make it more aggressive.

56:43.600 --> 56:45.000
So maybe that's part of his issue.

56:46.000 --> 56:46.700
You think so?

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I think he's rich enough.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.500
He doesn't drink the poor's water right?

56:50.500 --> 56:51.900
He probably gets some bottles.

56:52.100 --> 56:55.000
Bye I could be wrong, but thank you for calling in Miss Sparkles.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.200
Is there anything else you have for us?

56:57.100 --> 56:58.500
Digimon is better than Pokemon.

56:58.500 --> 56:58.900
That's it.

56:58.900 --> 56:59.100
Bye.

56:59.100 --> 56:59.800
Why?

57:01.900 --> 57:02.800
Why though?

57:02.900 --> 57:03.900
Why is it better?

57:04.400 --> 57:05.500
I'm not sure it is.

57:05.900 --> 57:08.600
Did you mind like they're basically the same thing, right?

57:08.600 --> 57:13.100
You you catch the animal you raise them and you train them to battle other animals.

57:14.500 --> 57:19.500
No, did you Mon like like each human like there's like special humans who are given one.

57:20.900 --> 57:30.200
And it's like it's like like their permanent partner and they only have one and they go on these adventures where they temporarily evolve them, but they devolve after the battle.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.000
It's different.

57:31.000 --> 57:36.600
But it was definitely like it was definitely made in the wake of the Pokemon craze in the 90s.

57:37.700 --> 57:38.900
Fair enough, fair enough.

57:38.900 --> 57:41.800
Look, I I missed that.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.300
I never grew up with that.

57:43.300 --> 57:46.300
I played a few Pokemon games and it's fun for what it is.

57:46.300 --> 57:50.100
It's just not something that really like captured me.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.900
Let's bring on the the next guest.

57:51.900 --> 57:53.700
I'm not sure which one of y'all joined first.

57:53.700 --> 57:56.300
So I'm just gonna I'm just gonna guess and we'll find out.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.200
Hello, you're live.

58:00.200 --> 58:04.000
Oh, he's gone.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.500
He went back.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.300
Try again.

58:08.300 --> 58:09.000
We'll try it again.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.900
Sorry, sorry.

58:11.900 --> 58:14.600
Hello, can you hear me?

58:14.600 --> 58:17.100
Vaguely, you're very low.

58:17.100 --> 58:18.200
Can you turn yourself up?

58:18.200 --> 58:22.400
By the way, thank you for the subs and Twitch.

58:22.400 --> 58:23.600
Thank you for the prime subs.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.100
Oh birds.

58:24.100 --> 58:26.900
Thank you for the gift subs and all that.

58:26.900 --> 58:28.100
I really appreciate that.

58:28.400 --> 58:31.000
Gang, if you want to donate to the channel through superchats

58:31.600 --> 58:34.700
through subs, please do but caller.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.200
Hi, give me money.

58:36.200 --> 58:37.700
Give what needs the money now.

58:37.700 --> 58:38.300
Give it to him.

58:38.300 --> 58:41.000
Okay, so you'll be a vtuber wick.

58:41.000 --> 58:41.900
You'll make money that way.

58:42.700 --> 58:43.900
What are you trying to say?

58:44.300 --> 58:44.500
Please?

58:44.500 --> 58:49.900
No, I don't know if you guys have talked about this but this

58:49.900 --> 58:54.600
is something I got into a bit of a discussion conversation

58:54.600 --> 58:58.400
with a friend of mine coming back did a long drive from

58:58.400 --> 59:02.000
Gen Con when the first Trump and diamonds really were coming

59:02.000 --> 59:08.700
down and something okay first premise first kind of given

59:08.700 --> 59:14.500
I guess is would Trump fans revolt would Trump cultists

59:14.500 --> 59:20.800
or whatever fans people who want to vote for Trump if he's

59:20.800 --> 59:22.700
indicted on every charge.

59:22.800 --> 59:26.200
Well, look what they did in January 6 after he didn't win

59:26.200 --> 59:27.100
the election, right?

59:27.100 --> 59:28.400
That's that's what I'm saying.

59:28.400 --> 59:31.500
So there would be a lot of to be clear like like en masse

59:31.500 --> 59:36.100
nothing en masse what they do is nothing but there would be

59:36.700 --> 59:41.200
let's say very small minority of very hyper partisan people

59:41.200 --> 59:43.500
that would do some terrible shit.

59:43.500 --> 59:43.800
Now.

59:43.900 --> 59:47.300
This isn't unique to Trump right and a lot of people will

59:47.300 --> 59:52.000
say it is but it's not I read a story recently.

59:53.700 --> 59:57.500
That has made me kind of wonder if the reason we don't see

59:57.500 --> 01:00:03.200
as much left-wing violence is because left-wing hard left-wingers

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.400
are just retarded.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.800
There is a man in 2020.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.900
I believe who the only reason the mayor of this the Jewish

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.100
mayor of this town is still alive is because this guy was

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.600
so incompetent in his assassination attempts.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.000
He failed twice like he went there to kill him, but he loaded

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.500
the bullet backwards and the gun advocating for more gun

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.000
training for leftist is what I'm here.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.800
I don't I don't know but it was just it was wild.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.000
So it's embarrassing.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.400
Yeah.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:35.400
So here's the thing.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.200
I've been thinking of it.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.900
So everyone always says that right wingers are more violent

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.000
than left-wingers and you ask him.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.400
Why do you say that?

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.700
I wouldn't agree with that statement.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.100
Yeah, I know I know but like when when when asked if they

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.300
give you the proper answer the proper answer is that there's

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.900
some sort of database that is divided up different types

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.800
of violence, right?

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.400
And I think it divides it.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.400
There's like hmm.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.100
Was it left-wing right-wing and libertarian?

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.600
It might be that's what it might be.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.500
But anyway, and like the overwhelming amount of of violence

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.400
is committed by right wingers.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.300
I'm like, well, this is very interesting.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.000
So I never never and it's like three years ago.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.800
I never I never got around to doing it, but I should eventually

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.200
take some time and do it but I decided to like click on some

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.500
random instances of what they called in their database

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.600
of right-wing violence and a few of them were was legitimate

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.900
right-wing violence like violence for a political purpose.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.000
But one of them was like there was a neo-nazi.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.500
He was like a skinhead and he had like like swastikas tattooed

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.700
all over his body, right?

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:39.000
And he killed his mother and went to jail and that person

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.900
was flagged as right-wing violence.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.600
I'm like, well, hold on.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.300
I mean, he he seemed to kill his mother.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:49.800
No, but like he seemed to kill his mother because his mother

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.200
was abusive, right?

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:55.900
And then the end of the situation is like, well, Is that

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.100
right-wing violence because a right-winger did it even though

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.800
there's no political motivation for the violence.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.500
It was personal.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.600
That doesn't seem to be that doesn't seem to be properly

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.100
filed. So at some point I was like, I'm going to sit down

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:10.700
with this 10,000 strong entry list and go through them that

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.600
I forgot to do it.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.400
And I was like three years ago.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:23.800
I forgot to do it and then like I keep thinking about it

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.600
like once every three months like I should do that and I

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.000
just I just don't well, it's something you keep hearing

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.800
right? You keep hearing that all right wingers commit more

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.600
violence in the West, right?

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.800
You hear that all the time and again, it might be true as

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.000
far as I know but but what I'm scared of, you know for this

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.400
premise really is to look back at January 6 and I'm scared

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.200
of people like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz the button, you know,

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.800
the banality of evil how simple it was for them to just keep

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.900
saying well we object on behalf of you know, whatever other

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.700
state, you know, we want them to recertify their election

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.500
call new slates that that's what I'm scared of.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.600
I what I don't like to see is when you have groups of people

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:15.600
that are in power who are scared of their own base by the

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.400
leader Trump scared into a position where they have to now

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.500
go. Okay.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.500
Are we actively supporting this coup?

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.700
Can we tepidly support this coup?

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:30.200
Can we you know, you know back it up and just use our political

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.700
rhetoric speech where we say we fight like hell and we do,

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.800
you know, because we have so many sick fans that will defend

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.600
this online.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.600
And even when all the facts and truth and how hours and hours

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.900
and videos out there.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.700
It's easy to just have someone like Alex Jones say they were

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.000
led into the Capitol.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.700
I was there, you know, and and at the same time and Tifa did

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:58.100
it so that so my whole the premise of the question was let's

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:04.800
say there's a legitimate threat from conservatives that let's

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.100
say Ted Cruz Jim Jordan many other conservative Republican

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:14.500
lawmakers. Okay, I'm not saying the Alex Jones people I'm

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:20.100
talking about lawmakers who say if Trump, you know, you know

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:26.100
gets charged now he's charged now he's going to go to prison

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:33.500
if he is actually going to be not acquitted and we're going

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.300
to put him into prison because of that, you know, that's

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.900
the ramifications of the things he's done.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.900
We will, you know, try to succeed from the Union or fuck

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.000
them are like I don't care if it's a credible threat.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:47.900
They alike.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:52.600
Look if it goes through the courts the courts make the decision

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.600
and find that there is wrongdoing and he is something beyond

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.200
a reasonable doubt guilty of these things and it carries

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.600
a sentence that includes jail time and he's sentenced to

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.900
jail time and then people are going to revolt because they

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:12.200
think that he should be above the law not fuck that.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.000
No, I don't care.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.800
Like if you we have to at least put the law above being fearful

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.300
of how people will respond to law.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:23.400
That's my instinct on this.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:28.400
I understand what you're saying my whole premise to relied

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.500
on the fact that Biden to try to keep the country United

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.800
would announce before the election that he would acquit,

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.900
you know, he would pardon Trump because I think about Nixon.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.500
I think about when's the last time something like this has

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500
ever happened in United States history and it was with Nixon

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.300
Nixon did the you know, he tried to tamper with the election.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.400
He you know got information from his political opponents

01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:01.300
and lied constantly constantly until he was finally backed

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:07.000
up into a wall where he had to completely give up power and

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.900
I firmly believe that if Nick Nixon did what he did today,

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.500
he would only could get away with it just because the internet

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.800
and the way the internet works.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.400
There's no way that he would not fight it more than someone

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.500
like Trump and especially have the character of someone like

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.300
Trump and what did we do to Nixon, you know, we completely

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.400
pardoned him Ford pardoned him.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.200
That was the first thing he did when he got into power when

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.900
he became president to forgive the country right to you know,

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.700
like I said, I don't know if that will I don't know if that'll

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.900
that'll heal what divides us.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.400
What do you think Dev given that premise you're in charge

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.300
your king for a day.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.800
Do you go ahead and pardon Trump or do you just let the

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.600
consequences play out?

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.700
I mean, yeah, he's guilty is guilty right and that's how

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.100
it should be obviously.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.800
But I mean the the question is basically like if it if it

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.100
turns out that Trump is legitimately guilty.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.700
However, punishing him would lead to a riot and possibly

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.400
a civil war.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:15.700
Do you do so the moralist in me says that you have to because

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.100
if you don't what where does that lead down the road, right?

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.500
You have somebody who does all this shit and just because

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.700
he's popular going to let him not do it.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.200
I mean, you know, you're gonna let me get away with it like

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.000
that sounds like it's a terrible precedent to set.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I mean some some more cynical people will say well, you know,

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.900
the rich and powerful and connected they already get away

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.000
with it and to some extent they do already get away with

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.200
it. But do you do you want to codify that as the actual

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.800
overt standard?

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.000
I don't think we do.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.000
I mean is there I mean his whole thing was that I he would

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.900
not vote for Biden if he announced that he would pardon Trump

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.800
because how can we let the you know, someone get away with

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.100
the rule of law and I guess that's another question.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.300
Would you vote for Biden if he says this is something I'm

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.800
not in one issue right with them.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.500
I would say that call but uh, I don't need my politicians

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.200
to be perfect and perfectly aligned with my values to vote

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:11.400
for them.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:11.800
Sure.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:12.300
Sure.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:12.500
Sure.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:12.700
Sure.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:13.000
Sure.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.100
Yeah, I don't know.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.400
I mean if there was a legitimate threat of Civil War, you

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.300
know, how far does that go?

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.700
Is there let's be real like if it was going to and I could

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.000
if I could scribe the future and I knew that would lead to

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.800
millions of deaths in a brutal bloody war then maybe I might

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.500
be like, okay.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.600
Well morals be damned.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.200
I don't want this but I don't know right.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.600
I don't know the future like that.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.400
I can only make decisions based on what I think is best and

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.600
what I think would be happened or think would be happened.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.500
That's silly what I think would happen in the situation but

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.800
being scared the worst-case scenario.

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.900
I just I don't see a realistic possibility that this is going

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:57.500
to be a thing.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.100
Thank you for calling in in pursuit of knowledge anything

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.000
else before I let you go.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.700
No, that's all catch you later.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.200
Yeah, like the the fear-mongering.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.400
Well, if we do this is going to destroy the country.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.600
Like if this is the rules these are the rules.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.800
I'm a rule follower.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.700
Does that make me sorry?

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.200
I don't know.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:18.900
You okay?

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:21.900
Yes.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.000
No, basically.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.400
I had no idea what hold on.

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.200
Okay.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:31.900
No, sorry about that.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:32.100
Sorry.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.500
Look I you have my full attention just as soon as he left.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.500
I had a DM from somebody that I had to answer really quick.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.800
I was actually asking I was asking Pisco in fact about what

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:47.100
he thought of what Artemis presented and he just call in.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.500
He just Dino Pisco.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.000
Yeah, he's been on my show before too.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.200
Oh, yeah, tell him to call in tell him to jump backstage.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:53.900
He's in the server.

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.200
Like all the people we've talked about today pretty much

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.100
are in the server watches in the server destination.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.000
So all of them, you know, they're all allowed to call in

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.500
but while while you do that, I'll bring in the next caller

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.500
and we'll see what they have to say.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.100
Hello your life.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.500
Hey, can you hear me?

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:14.900
Yes.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:15.300
Hello.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:21.400
Hey, so I I just wanted to call in because I have some pretty

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.600
detailed knowledge about the tunnel.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.400
I don't like calling it the new top like gives me a little

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:35.600
bit of the of the ick but I'm like of the wick you mean look

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.600
that's what it is.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.100
It's a Jewish tunnel.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.400
They made the tunnel.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.000
I don't know what does he want to call it?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.800
How about that Hebrew tunnels?

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.700
Hebrew the Hebrew that's not alliterative.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.000
I guess you tunnel is in a little bit illiterate.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.700
Yeah, it's lazy lazy.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.500
We can do better.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:52.700
We'll think of it.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:53.200
We'll think of it.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.900
Okay, the tunnels under New York City that were built by

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.000
Jews go ahead.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:01.100
So I live very nearby to there like a couple of blocks away.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:07.500
I am not a member of I'm not a Chabad Lubavitcher, but I know

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:12.400
a lot about them and this it's so interesting to me that this

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.500
community is now getting all this attention because of this

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.800
thing going viral.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.500
But essentially the tunnel is actually the result of a

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:26.700
religious schism within the Chabad Lubavitcher community.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.700
It's it how much of the lore about this?

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:38.000
Do you want to know give us give us the you have about 10

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.500
minutes on the call version.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.000
All right, that's plenty of time.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.600
So essentially I don't want all 10 minutes to be you explaining

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.200
this by the way, but go ahead.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.100
Okay, super valid super valid.

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:53.400
There's a bunch of different Orthodox Jewish communities in

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.900
New York City that all come from different religious dynasties.

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.100
They call them that they came over from Eastern Europe.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.500
So there's the sat Mars in Williamsburg.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.000
There's the Lubavitcher in Crown Heights.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.200
I don't remember what the people in Borough Park are called

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.400
you can tell the difference between them by the way, they

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.300
dress and stuff.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.800
Anyway, the Chabad Lubavitcher's had this rabbi.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.500
If you walk around New York City these days, you'll see stickers

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.700
all over the place that have his picture on them.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.600
Let's say the Messiah is coming or the Messiah is here and

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.800
the difference between those two stickers is part of the

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.600
religious schism where there's essentially three different

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.500
groups of people.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.900
There's the rabbi died the Reb died in 1994.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.000
Um, some people think he's just dead and that's it.

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.300
Some people think he was the Messiah and he did die, but

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.900
he's going to come back to life.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.300
Those are the people that say that he's coming and then there

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.000
are other people that think he's here and those people think

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.500
he actually didn't die at all because he was the Messiah.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.300
And okay, first of all, the rabbi hole is amazing.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.100
We may call it the rabbi hole from now on.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.300
But um, I like that rabbi hole.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.700
Yeah, that's amazing.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.200
But uh, how does that connect?

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.100
Yeah, what?

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.900
Okay, you got groups.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.100
They think this dude's a messiah or was the Messiah maybe

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.900
dead tunnels?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
How does this connect?

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:28.100
So the tunnel that is the subject of all this, you know mess

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:34.200
was dug underneath 770 Eastern Parkway, which amongst people

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.600
in that community is a very famous building because it's

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.700
the synagogue that the Lubavitcher rabbi used during his

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:47.900
lifetime and after he died because of this split amongst

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.600
the community.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:53.100
They weren't able to ever elect a successor and the actual

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.700
building is split in half and the people on top of the building

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.400
are part of the group of people that I think think he's dead.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.900
The people on the bottom think he's coming back to life and

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.400
the people who dug the tunnel were the people who think that

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.600
he's still alive.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.300
And they dug the tunnel because he allegedly gave some kind

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:20.200
of commandment that the synagogue needs to be expanded and

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.200
they were trying to dig a tunnel from a sort of unused like

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.600
former bathhouse.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.900
I think either from another building or to another building.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.100
I don't know exactly.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.500
I think it was from another building.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.400
So they could connect them so they could fulfill the Rebs

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.100
commandment of expanding and thereby do a mitzvah, which is

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.500
like the whole if you ever walk around New York will also

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.100
see they'll ask you if you're a Jew all the time all over

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:48.500
the place the same people because they're always trying to

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.900
do mitzvahs because that either makes the Messiah approve

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.300
of you or makes him come back sooner depending on your

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:59.300
interpretation is asking if you're a Jew or not a mitzvah

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.800
is just doing a good thing.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.800
And it could be any number of different things and asking

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.200
someone if they're Jewish is a good thing because if they

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.700
say yes, then you have them do a prayer with you and having

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:14.900
a lapsed you do a prayer is one of the biggest mitzvahs

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.300
there is because the whole point is to get all the lapsed

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.300
Jews to become religious again.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.200
And that's when the Messiah will return.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.200
I know it sounds completely fucking ridiculous and it is

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.000
to me but like it's like the South Park Mormon episode,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.200
you know where it's like this is what these people actually

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.500
believe. Yeah.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.200
What do you think Dev?

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.200
I don't I don't know if I have.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.300
Yeah, I have I have no idea about anything Jewish.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.300
I can't I don't I don't have anything to say I can't comment.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.000
I don't know what any of this stuff did.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.100
It's interesting enough.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.700
Thanks for calling in about it.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.600
Well glad you glad you thought it was interesting.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.300
I did I I just look there's got to be better memes out there

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.400
about it though because the truth isn't as important as

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.500
the funny memes, but thank you for calling in friend and

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.500
we'll talk to you later.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.400
Take okay.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.000
Yeah, that was a lot.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.100
He could have just made that all up.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.100
See this is a problem.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.500
Like he could have just legit made every single sentence

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.000
of what he said of his explanation up.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.000
I wouldn't know I've been like, oh really this one.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.300
That's a I'll have to look into that.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.600
But it's wild if true.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:38.100
We'll have to see let's bring in the next we're getting through

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.300
them where I want to get as many people as we can.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.000
We have a long line and we'll get to as many people as we

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.100
can. Let's bring in the next guest and I do want peace go

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:46.600
to call in.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:52.000
So then we could pit Artemis foul against peace go that

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.500
would be fun.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.900
But hello your life.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.600
That'd be funny actually.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:56.400
Yes.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:57.900
Can you hear me?

01:16:59.400 --> 01:16:59.800
Hello?

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:00.600
Yep coming through.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.600
Can I ask to have a question about the Antonio Gramsci

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.000
video? Sure.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
When you talked about the cultural Marxism Wikipedia page

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.500
you talked about like this woman Joan Braun and then later

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.800
on on stitch and Adam you talked about how a lot of it was

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.300
completely rewritten by her.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.300
It's not like the entire story about that because that can't

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.100
be the case.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:26.700
What do you mean?

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.800
Said that a lot of the cultural Marxism Wikipedia came

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.000
rewritten to her.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.300
Yes, thank you.

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:44.000
I remember you saying is that is that is that just the entire

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.600
story with that?

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.000
Well, I mean I didn't put this in the video cuz I didn't

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.800
know it at the time but it turned out that a lot of the

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:57.300
edits to the cultural Marxism Wikipedia page are from her

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.300
internet username from back in the day and she just cited

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.000
her own paper and because it's like like no one connected

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:05.700
the dots on that.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.300
It just stayed and that's what it is now.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.300
Yes, I just wanted to double check that cuz I just don't

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.200
feel ridiculous.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:13.900
Thank you.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.400
Thank you.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.000
Thanks Dave.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.000
Yep, that's that's what it is man.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.600
I mean at some point I might have to do a video on Joan

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.700
Braun but like there's she's like a dime a dozen academic

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.200
Of someone who's just like leftist and corrupt and in academia

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.900
and writing completely nonsense fucking papers that are being

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.800
cited with some sort of moral and factual authority because

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.900
it comes from University.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:38.400
Well, it's kind of like and I do want to talk about this

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:38.600
right?

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.200
It's like the woozle effect and I'm not sure if you've heard

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:42.500
of that.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.600
Are you familiar with the term?

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:44.600
Nope.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:49.700
So what it is is say you publish a paper.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.500
You're an academic and you publish a paper.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.600
Okay, then you get your friend.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:54.900
To cite your paper.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:19:00.600
Okay, and talk about whatever it is the subject racism or

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.900
now you have two papers, right two papers and then you'll

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:07.700
get a third person to cite that paper and then you will cite

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:11.700
the third paper and it becomes like a circle right this this

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.700
this woozle effect.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:15.700
It's from a Winnie the Pooh story where Piglet and Pooh

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:18.800
were following their own tracks looking for the woozle, but

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.000
it turns out that they were just following their own tracks

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.700
in the snow.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.000
And that's what happens a lot with the the citing of the

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.700
sources and things like that is especially in academia is

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.600
they'll all cite each other in this like incestuous circle

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.100
jerk of research quote-unquote.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.800
And so you got to be careful from that and Wikipedia unfortunately

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.600
falls prey to that sometimes because their standards for

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.400
what gets cited as information is it has to be in a book.

01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:52.500
It doesn't have to be cracked.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:57.400
It just has to be published and so Wikipedia is a good

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.900
place to start looking for things but you should start

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.400
going like you should like read Wikipedia for at least

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.400
the mainstream view which to be honest is generally mostly

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.100
correct with some obvious examples, but generally mostly

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.600
correct but then after you've learned the mainstream view

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.400
you should start reading the sources in the Wikipedia

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.200
article right read the sources directly and then they will

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.500
have sources and you should start like you should at some

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500
point start chasing them back, right?

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.300
Thank you, by the way for calling in a record.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.800
Was that literally all you had?

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.700
Yeah, that's literally all I had.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.000
It sounded kind of unbelievable.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.100
Yeah, that's what it is though.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.800
Speaking of academics.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.700
I have a PhD that's once Colin Eucharist.

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:46.300
He's a great guy.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.900
He's worked in academia and I want to he says he has

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.200
a story about this that he wants to tell us so we're going

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.000
to grab him to call in and tell the story.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:54.100
Sure.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.200
Lusmark you're alive.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.900
Are you the PhD?

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.000
Can't even hear how to unmute.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.200
Hello.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.200
No, I'm sorry.

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.700
My voice is mostly shot.

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.800
So you're gonna have to bear with me.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.700
Okay, but the phenomenon that you were just describing

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.300
I have a particularly funny story about this.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:17.600
So this is a relatively legendary thing from where I went

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.300
to undergrad.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.700
There was a student in West of class who had just learned

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was reading

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.900
the Wikipedia article and had learned and this is this is

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.900
probably well over 10 years back at this point.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:34.100
So Wikipedia moderation standards have improved dramatically

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.200
in the past five to ten years.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.900
But one way that you used to be able to sneak some really

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.900
fun things into a Wikipedia article was by putting a minor

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.900
detail in a sentence that was already footnoted that would

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.800
sort of like escape notice for some time and then sort of

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.300
just get cemented and so he was reading through the narrative

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.800
of Gavrilo Princip pulling out his pistol and shooting the

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.600
Archduke and he added a fun little anecdote in that where

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.000
he said he pulled out his pistol pistol whipped a nearby

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.500
pedestrian and then shot the Archduke and just left it there.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:11.700
Now if you go Google Gavrilo Princip pistol whip you will

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.700
find for example, here's a 2014 article from the Australian

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.100
Broadcasting Company on the anniversary of the beginning

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.300
of World War One that quotes this anecdote that says he pistol

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.200
whipped a nearby pedestrian and then shot the Archduke it

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.800
made it into a high school history textbook made it in newspapers

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.800
and then eventually got you know retroactively cited back

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.800
on to Wikipedia as like well, look these are reputable sources

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.600
that are saying that Gavrilo Princip pistol whipped a nearby

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.700
pedestrian. But if you go back and look at the edit history

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.400
of the article, there's this one fanatical editor who finally

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.800
got it removed because he's like I'm telling you guys this

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.400
wasn't a thing before this original edit all of the sources

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.900
that say it all come from this you guys are crazy.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.200
He's just going nuts for months trying to get this off

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.000
and finally it's gone, but it happens.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:53.800
It really happens.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:58.600
So I salute you Autis whoever that guy was very very fanatical

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.300
about editing Wikipedia.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:04.700
You are the glue that holds us together, but that kind of

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:09.400
a story isn't exactly uncommon.

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.400
It's not rare.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.000
I should say it's not as rare as you would think and this

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.200
happens with in in especially in kind of streaming circles

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:23.000
a lot too is a rumor will start that will be covered on

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.700
different streams and then it will become it will it will

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.800
escape. There's an escape velocity to it where it doesn't

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:35.700
need to stand on any foundation because the foundation

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.000
it stands on is now people talking about it.

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.600
I don't know but that's good.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.400
How are you by the way?

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:41.900
How's it going?

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:44.500
I'm doing okay other than losing my voice over the past

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.100
week. Yeah, I came because I had promised you we would talk

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.100
about the plagiarism stuff on Friday.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.000
So I wanted to at least get a little bit of it out here

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.800
in the short time that I have because man there have been

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.300
so many things in the past year.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.400
I don't want to put these on the same level, right?

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.200
They're obviously different but like October 7th is one

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.300
example and the the plagiarism thing is another example

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.500
of just like news stories that more than anything serve

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:15.500
to like show people's inability to just process facts at

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.100
all where like, you know, so for example like the hospital

01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:22.400
bombing in Gaza you saw people who it never could possibly

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.100
have been Hamas or another militant organization that did

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.100
that or it was an accident, you know, it was always going

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.300
to be Israel and vice versa.

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.500
There are people who could never conceive of Israel doing

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.200
something bad same thing with the plagiarism accusations

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.600
obviously again, like probably 10 tears down and importance

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.800
but like there are people who for whom it is inconceivable

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.600
that this woman could ever have intentionally plagiarized

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.900
repeatedly throughout her entire academic career despite

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:46.700
all evidence and if you think that she did and you think

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.800
she doesn't deserve her post because of that while you're

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.100
part of you know, this right-wing conspiracy here to be

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.400
clear Chris everyone knows what you're talking about.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.800
The plagiarism thing was Claudine.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.500
I think that's her first name Claudine Claudine gay Claudine

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.600
gay was the president of Harvard.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:05.000
She recently stepped down after credible accusations of

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.700
plagiarism hit the news, right and there are

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.400
and I'm sure still are today people who are defending this

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.200
through various variety of reasons.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.700
One of the reasons that I was called a useful idiot by by

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:31.600
our friend smug bug because smug bug thinks that because

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.500
it was a right-wing organization that pushed this that it

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.300
must be something we have to resist because the right-wing

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:44.400
messenger gave the message is something that no good leftist

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.300
would ever countenance.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.700
I think that's problematic for a few reasons.

01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:57.700
One of those reasons being that there is this idea that

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:04.200
the truth is only the truth if it's told by the right people

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.400
and I think that's harmful.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.100
We even if some even at the worst person, you know tells

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.200
you something that's true.

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.200
It's still true.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.500
It's still correct.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.700
It's still something that actually is factually true.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:19.900
Now you can you can interrogate their motivations, but when

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.400
it comes to plagiarism, we don't have to interrogate the

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.300
motivations even if they have the worst intentions if they

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.500
expose plagiarism plagiarism should be dealt with especially

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.600
if you're a president of a academic institution, I don't

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.000
know especially the most prestigious academic institution

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
in the United States, right?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.700
Like I mean in her in her New York wasn't New York Times

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:47.700
op-ed after she resigned former president yay said that she

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:51.100
did receive a lot of like actually explicit racist harassment

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.300
and I believe her I totally believe that there are people

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.200
who were absolutely giddy and gleeful that a black woman

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.000
was falling to this campaign.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.900
I totally believe that but it my point in the argument was

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.300
smug about on Twitter and and and that I'll stand by is

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:08.500
that it's a type of accusation that doesn't have ammo unless

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.500
the evidence is there her academic record is public.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
You can go look at her articles on Google Scholar.

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.900
You can Google the paragraphs and they will bring up other

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.500
things from other books right then she did not cite them

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.000
appropriately.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.200
So it's you know, if there are racists who are happy that

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.800
she's fired, you know, I don't like making versus happy but

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.300
sometimes, you know, perfectly reasonable things make bad

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.500
people happy right like thought stuff.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.600
Well initially I was thinking of those two CGP Grey videos

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.300
about following sources back through the centuries you guys

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.200
would know I'm talking about.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:44.500
Yeah.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:44.800
Yes.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:45.600
Yeah.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.400
Yeah, the Staten Island story about the guy who had barrels

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:51.700
on his ship and he unleashed them to to win the race and

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.400
then there was the story about Tiffany.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.100
Where did Tiffany first appear in the in the lexicon as

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.400
a name right and both of those stories involved him like

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:04.800
reading books that no one's read for like a hundred years

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
and they've just been sitting on the shelf in the back of

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.100
a library somewhere and no one like no one knows anything

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.100
about it and no one cares that such obscure knowledge,

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:13.500
right?

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.100
So I was I was thinking of that because there's a lot of

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.900
instances where you'll have let's say it's something that's

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:22.500
true just completely true right and it's in an old book.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.100
All right.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:26.300
And then someone will like 20 years later will cite that

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:29.300
off-handedly in their book and then it gets cited again

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.100
and again and it goes like five or six books down changing

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.900
a little bit each time just citing the previous book as

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.800
to where it came from and then it gets then eventually

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.600
as soon as the the internet hits then it's on Wikipedia

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.200
and it's probably in some kind of dumbed down form or

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.000
it's on it's an article somewhere and you know, it's

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.600
it's half truth at best at that point from all the

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.700
transformations it's gone through right?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.900
So a lot of this sounds like that.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.800
Well and and one one thing that makes the type of plagiarism

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.000
that she was committing.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:28:59.600
I think so.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.800
So the reason academics I think should care about it

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.900
so much is when you do omit question marks and citations

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.200
you risk this thing happening even more so you risk just

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.400
stating a claim that someone takes this fact from your

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.000
work. They cite it from your work.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.400
You haven't cited where you got it from maybe like in

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.400
one instance with her thing.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:20.600
She took someone else's paragraph wholesale and changed

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.200
one word.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.200
It was about the relationship between you know X initiative

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.100
and voting turnout among the black population or something

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.700
like that and the original thing that she copied from

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:30.700
said it had a negative correlation and she flipped it

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:33.800
to a positive correlation not on the basis of her own statistical

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.100
analysis, but just changing a word and so she's completely

01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:39.700
changed the conclusion that someone else arrived at based

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.500
on their own statistical analysis.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.500
But now there's a paper out there that I could cite that

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.200
makes that claim that bolsters my evidence right and I

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.400
can't follow her chain back.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.000
She's she's cut me off from even doing that work the

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.900
hard work to go dig up that book that nobody's ever read.

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.100
You know, like I can't do that anymore when she doesn't

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.000
put quotes when she doesn't cite what she's supposed to

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:57.200
yeah.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.100
Yeah, that's what we should be able to do theoretically.

01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:03.600
Yeah, I think it's just hilarious that the internet has

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.200
been okay.

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.100
Let's say the left-wing internet has been doubling down

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.400
on defending this woman over and over and over because

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:12.000
she is left-wing herself and she plagiarized what she's

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.900
left-wing at the same time like a week earlier.

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.400
The left-wing internet was in an uproar about plagiarism

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.800
when it was an H bomber guy put out that video.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:24.400
Yeah, right about YouTubers played plagiarizing and it's

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.000
like guys like very clearly there's just a partisan angle

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.400
to this right where it doesn't like the plagiarism itself

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.300
doesn't actually matter to these people.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.700
The only thing that matters is whether their guys are

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:35.600
winning or losing.

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.400
Look this this is what frustrates me because this is

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.300
the first time this has happened and won't be the last

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.600
time this has happened where there's like this huge

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.100
partisan angle to what we think is right or wrong.

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:49.200
I I actually believe in a lot of these these values right

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.200
that leftists claim to hold I actually do believe that

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:56.000
there is that racism is bad like anti-semitism is a problem.

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.300
I do think that plagiarism and stealing other people's

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:03.600
work theft of time and theft of labor are both really big

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.600
issues, right?

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.000
I think that there's all these things at stake, but you

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.700
hurt what I want to happen when you make a game of it when

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:16.500
you make it this political football game that you're playing

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.900
just to hurt the other team and make sure your team gets

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:19.800
those touchdowns.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.400
I don't care about the team.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:26.000
The only reason I'm on this team so to speak right is that

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.400
it has the values that I I think are correct and when you

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.100
show that you do not care about those values.

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.500
That's I don't care if your team wins or not at that point,

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:37.000
right?

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:37.700
I don't know.

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:38.400
That's just my thought.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:39.200
Yeah.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:44.800
Yeah, there's an article in the Harvard Crimson the student

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.100
paper obviously has been covering this a lot and there was

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:51.100
one op-ed by the editorial board that came to her defense.

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.400
I think one thing that gets lost in the whole discussion

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.000
is the actual timeline of events where much of the statements

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.200
that Harvard made and that the defenses of her came before

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.800
additional accusations had come to light and been sort of

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:03.400
adjudicated.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.800
So there were early accusations that were raised in October

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:08.500
after the controversy with the congressional hearing.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.200
So people started digging into her record because she offended

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.000
people and they found these things that look suspicious those

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.300
early ones were like, okay.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.000
This isn't that bad like she cited this paper elsewhere in

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.500
the dissertation like she could probably could have done

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.700
better and then as time went on more and more things were

01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:25.200
found. So the Harvard Crimson editorial board wrote in favor

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.800
of her, but then there was a dissenting member of the undergrad

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.000
Honor Council at Harvard who wrote an essay basically who

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.700
said I get to weigh in on decisions of whether or not someone

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:38.300
gets suspended or expelled at Harvard for exactly this kind

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.700
of stuff. And this is definitionally plagiarism.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:44.200
I voted to suspend people undergrads at Harvard for violating

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:44.900
this policy.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.500
How can our president be held to a lower standard than Joe

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.800
Schmoe jr.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:52.600
Who copied a paragraph off Wikipedia in his senior seminar

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.300
or whatever, you know, like like how it's a really good op-ed.

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.500
I think like the student is like I take these decisions

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:01.000
seriously and it doesn't seem like Harvard is as a school.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:01.500
So yeah.

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.700
Bro Dev, what were you going to say?

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:06.500
Sorry.

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.300
Yeah, I cut you off there.

01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:12.000
So wick you and I had a very short back and forth and it

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
was over Twitter banning like left-wing accounts recently,

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:16.300
right?

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:16.700
Oh, yeah.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.200
Yeah, I was that was my pocket in case things.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:19.800
Yeah.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.300
Well, I don't know.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.100
I don't know if you were replying to this but I'll just send

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:29.700
you my tweet anyway, but it's basically someone said, you

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:33.300
know a bunch of left-wing accounts and journalism suspended

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:36.500
from from Twitter and then I posted that xkcd.

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.500
No, I promise you it wasn't a subtweet.

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.500
I've seen a lot of it on my time.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.600
Okay, people celebrating this happening and saying good

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.100
right like the I'm not necessarily celebrating there is

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.000
some schadenfreude here for sure, but I'm not necessarily

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.800
celebrating but there's that legendary xkcd tweet where

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.600
the person says the right to free speech means the government

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.600
can't arrest you for what you want for what you say is just

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.400
that people listening think you're an asshole and they're

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.600
showing you the door right and whenever let's say, you know

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.300
over the past decade online a right-winger has been censored

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:10.800
and says what about free speech Leftists have always posted

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.900
this comic and they've been very smug about it.

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:13.500
You know what I mean?

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.000
They said well or even crazier you'll like I've seen this

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.200
from let's say even more radical accounts where they'll

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:26.100
say freeze peach freeze and because they make a mockery

01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:30.100
of the idea of appealing to free speech and what's underneath

01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:33.300
that this is something that I tried to Hammer home in my

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:38.300
talk on your channel wick with with Karl Max is that you

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.300
can't simply have a standard where you are not censored

01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.600
and you can have all the debates about your ideas that you

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:47.600
like but your opponents are censored and the reason you

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.900
can't do that even if you think your opponents are evil

01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:54.400
and that it would be good to censor them is because when

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.500
they get power and they will they will turn it around on

01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.800
you. And that's what's happening now is that you like

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:05.100
yeah, the the cultural zeitgeist is shifting rightward a

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:08.800
little bit right Elon now controls Twitter and you're seeing

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:11.600
things move in a more rightward direction online and now

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.100
you're seeing Leftists get censored and so the liberal

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:17.400
response to that is hey, we shouldn't be censoring everyone

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.000
which is true and I agree with you on that right, but

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.200
if you if you have if you have if you have a paradigm where

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.900
Every time the left is in power they censor because they

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.800
don't care about liberal principles hypothetically and

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.000
every time I get a hypothetically the right is in power.

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.900
They do care about liberal principles.

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.700
So they don't censor that means that you that you have

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.800
basically a ratcheting effect only moving one way right

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.400
where you have things are pushed leftward and then when

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.300
things swing back, they don't actually swing back.

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.600
You just maintain a neutrality of whatever came before

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.400
So there is a good argument that unless your opponents

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.700
commit to not being censorious in the future.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.900
You must also go against liberal principles and

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:04.900
censor them because liberal principles only work if

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:07.900
ever it is a trap it is a trap but but you have to

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:10.200
figure out that not doing it is also a trap though

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.600
because then things will they will just inevitably

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.200
win over enough iterated games, right?

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.400
So you have to say listen, we're going to punish you

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.000
by the same standard that you punished us and we're

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.300
going to do it until you recognize that your standard

01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:25.500
is wrong and you can't do it to us.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.800
That's not why they're punishing them, right?

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.600
Like that's not why it's happening.

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:33.300
They're doing it because it's team sports and so free

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.600
speech is a big issue of mine.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.600
And one of the problems I have is that almost no one

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.000
actually believes in it, right?

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.400
A lot of people will say that they believe in it, but

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.800
they'll do this thing where they're always willing to

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.300
censor the other side because they're dangerous and

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:51.000
they're never willing to in any time the same weapon

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:51.900
is turned on them.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.700
They decry it, right?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.200
And one of the things the great things about organizations

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.600
like thefire.org.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.200
I don't know if you're familiar with them.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.900
Is that whether you're left right or center, they will

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.900
defend your free speech rights legally, right?

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.100
And that's how it should be.

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:07.300
Yeah.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.000
Yeah, I agree.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.700
But the problem becomes is it's a cultural problem

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.100
when we do this.

01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.800
Well, it happened to us.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.200
So now we're going to do it to you to show you what it

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.100
feels like.

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:24.400
It just perpetuates the cycle and so someone has to be

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:29.200
a bigger person and say no, we're not going to continue

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.000
this cycle.

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:33.900
We're going to stop it and we are going to both culturally

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:38.700
and legislatively defang the processes and methods on

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:43.600
which people engage in this attack on free speech.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:49.100
So they say so I completely agree with you, but I think

01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:53.300
that process can only happen after you've given the sensors

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.500
a dose of their own medicine.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.300
So I can give you two examples, right?

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.500
So one I said when we were talking about this week, I sent

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.300
you that Star Trek The Next Generation clip.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.200
Yeah, did you watch it?

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.300
No, I got to watch it.

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.300
I'm gonna be real with you.

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.400
Like I saw it on my Twitter.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.200
I'm like, oh, that's cool.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.200
I'll watch it later.

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.700
And then I just ever did.

01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:13.700
Okay, so the episode is that Picard is kidnapped by aliens

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
and the aliens are actually very benevolent and benign.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.500
They were just experimenting, right?

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:22.000
They didn't really hurt him, but then he kidnaps them and

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.400
he holds them and they're like extremely distressed and like,

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.900
oh, you can't be doing this.

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.200
We didn't mean you any harm and it's like well now, you know

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.800
what it feels like you can't do this to me.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.100
And now that I've done it to you, you're going to know why

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:34.200
you can't do this to me.

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.200
And that was the lesson he he did it a bit and then he let

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.300
off and said now, you know, and then they parted ways, right?

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.700
And there was no eternal punishment of him.

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:46.200
There was if I thought if I thought that the people in power

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.900
right that we're going to punish the Liberals would just

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:52.900
do it like a card would then maybe I would agree with you,

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.300
but they're not going to do that.

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.500
You and I both know they're not going to do that.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.600
Yeah, it's going to take it away.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.600
It's escalating my medic cycle.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.000
Yeah.

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:00.700
Yeah.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.300
Yeah, the other option is they escalate and that's also

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.000
not good, right?

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:06.300
So so there's um, the other the other example is Destiny

01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.500
talks about this a lot where Destiny says something like

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:15.000
he seems to be kind of fixated on when Obama's final Supreme

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.700
Court justice was stolen from him because they simply blocked

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:21.000
it for a year and a half by not holding that hearing.

01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:22.600
Remember that work?

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.100
I do.

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.100
I remember it.

01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:26.100
Yeah, I remember it distinctly.

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:28.800
There's all there's a lot of arguments there that that this

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.100
was Harry Reid's fault when he changed the filibuster rules

01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:33.500
anyway, but carry on.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.400
Yeah, yeah, but basically the even if it was legal it was

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.400
very clearly immoral and against the spirit of how things

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.300
should function right?

01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:44.800
Yeah, and so so Destiny's opinion seems to be you know,

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.700
what we should once we once we have the capability to do

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.200
so we should do that once to the Republicans just so they

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.700
have a taste of it and then we can say okay, you know, we've

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:56.000
now hit you back now.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.700
We both know we can't behave this way but we have but we

01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.500
can't just get them get away with it.

01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:03.400
We have to do it at least once to them so they know it's

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.700
the same principle here though.

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.000
Yeah, but that's never going to be how that works.

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.900
What that's going to do is people are going to say oh it

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:12.800
worked we're going to engage in it to show you a lesson.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.100
Oh, wait, it actually worked again.

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:18.200
Hell this is going to be a power politics play from now

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.700
on and now it's normalized in the lexicon of how we behave

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.500
lexicons wrong.

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.100
Yeah, but you know, this is now yeah, but going my biggest

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:28.500
yeah, this is my biggest disagreement with Josiah pondering

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.500
politics first, but whenever I get my voice back, we're

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:32.700
supposed to talk about this book actually tyranny their

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:36.600
minority same authors who did how democracies die a few

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:40.100
years back and one of their arguments in both books.

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:44.400
Is that you do actually see like a deterioration of like

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.800
cross aisle and Democratic norms in the US particularly

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.000
around the Clinton impeachment and like since then things

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.700
have like become in an escalating cycle more and more hostile.

01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.900
And so for example, like we didn't used to have real controversy

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.600
about Supreme Court appointments, but since Clinton we have

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.300
on both sides.

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.200
And so I'm yeah, I'm not convinced that there's ever going

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.100
to be a point where one side says well you did this and

01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:10.300
now we get to clap back and that's going to be it like you

01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:12.900
understand now how bad it's going to be I see it like yet

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.600
more like the ratcheting or more like I love Renee Gerard

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.400
and he talks about escalating cycles of imitative violence

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.500
and I think that's just sort of what's happening.

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:23.500
I don't know how it ends until one side decides to be principled

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.000
and and not do that but then that requires you know, a lot

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:26.900
of sacrifice as well.

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:31.500
So, yeah, I just I don't see where that definitive point

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.800
is where like I love Star Trek and I love that example.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.400
I think it's great.

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.400
I think that's how it would work in an ideal world like

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.900
a lot of things in Star Trek, but unfortunately we're stupid

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:43.300
and not rational and that's not how people actually work,

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:43.700
right?

01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:47.000
So here's the thing right because the options only seem

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.300
to be you you give your opponents as much unfairness as

01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:56.100
they give use to teach them and then you stop or you both

01:41:56.100 --> 01:42:00.300
escalate or you do nothing and allow them to escalate

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.900
unopposed and then like then you just lose right now.

01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.500
There seems to be no other option.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.200
No, Dev.

01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:08.400
I disagree that you lose in that case.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.900
What you do is you draw a delineation distinction in the

01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.400
voters minds between it's been okay.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.700
I'm talking about liberal democracies here, which we live

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:19.900
in. Okay, I'm not going to I'm not going to posit on whether

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:24.100
this works in a another system, but in our system what

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.300
you do is you say okay these this is why we're different.

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.600
We have principles they do not and generally this gives

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.800
you elections, right?

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.100
This is why you win elections generally and that's going

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:37.200
to happen all the time.

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.300
It's not going to be a clear and present thing.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.600
But when you stoop to their level what you do is you make

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.800
it a situation where people cannot tell the difference between

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:49.000
you and them and then why would they vote for you over them?

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Because I mean then it's just they can't they can't tell

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.700
you're both engaging in the same kind of chicanery and so

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.400
see that this this this makes sense up until the point that

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:04.300
the other side is actually able to fuck with how elections

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:07.000
are run and then this breaks down because then it doesn't

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
matter who votes for you.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.100
As long as we're referencing apt sci-fi things, you know,

01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:17.500
this my position I think is like the the war games position

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:20.500
right you the only winning move is not to play right like

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.800
that. You can't once you get in the cycle like everybody

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:26.300
dies or you know, somebody taps out.

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:29.900
Those are the only two options and in my estimation unless

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:34.000
unless we actually have strong enough institutional bullworks

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.700
that punish people when they start stepping out of the real

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:40.200
bounds, but I'm I used to be very optimistic about that.

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.100
I don't know if I am anywhere.

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.700
Honestly, I think America does I mean I've been following

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.000
the various Trump indictments.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.500
I think he's totally fucked at least on the documents case.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:52.100
The other ones are hitting this but like we'll see but if

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:55.800
you see that the most recent Michigan poll like he's up eight

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.800
points in Michigan right now, Michigan.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:58.700
It's insane.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.200
Like I if I was Biden I would be quaking right now if that's

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.200
if it's a good poll and all that blah blah blah, you know

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.000
political science stuff.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.200
That's I did I did fake political science.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.200
I do political theory, but my friends who do real political

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.500
science. Tell me all of these things so but that's should

01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.900
be scary if you don't want Trump to win and I don't want

01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:18.700
Trump to win even though I'm a conservative so like I don't

01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:21.300
know what a second Trump presidency looks like.

01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.900
I think it looks like gutting all those bulwarks.

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:27.300
I'm confident in if yeah, you all of these cases could stick

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.100
if they give him house arrest and he's still on the ballot

01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:30.800
and he gets re-elected what happens?

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:32.800
I don't know.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:38.600
Yeah, I mean I do like the the idea of Trump goes to jail,

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.400
but he's also the president and then you have like his Secret

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.600
Service in the jail with him because that could be that

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.800
could be like a hilarious movie, but it's yeah, it's it would

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:48.900
make a fun movie.

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.500
You're correct.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:54.400
But a reality would be no, I don't want to know that Trump

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.300
Trump ruling the country from jail.

01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:57.000
Oh my God.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:57.400
Listen.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.400
I'm glad I'm not an American you guys have fun with that

01:44:59.400 --> 01:44:59.800
shit.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.400
You Chris.

01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:04.700
Thank you for calling in.

01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:06.400
I'm sorry that you're not feeling well.

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400
Well, that's great.

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.100
I'm sorry.

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.800
I just your chat has this neon Reagan guy who put conservative

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.200
and scare quotes fight me you Chris on Discord message me

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:14.600
anytime.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.900
Let's ha ha ha neon Reagan's from my community.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.400
He is like a he's a paleoconservative.

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:25.200
Oh, well, then we have more overlapping things, but he is

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.800
a pro Trump paleoconservative.

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.900
Oh, well, then that's stupid.

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.600
Okay, that's fine.

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:31.600
Okay.

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.100
Thank you for calling in you guys.

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:39.300
I like you Chris you Chris is one of the original Wickers

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:45.700
who would go and talk with me when I was like had two people

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.100
watching me, right?

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.000
So really good guy.

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.900
He's fun to argue with I have some substantive disagree with

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:55.800
some of them on a few things, but I think that overall whip

01:45:55.800 --> 01:46:00.500
smart honest honest guy genuine and he's a PhD so I get to

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:01.600
throw that around a little bit.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.500
So yeah, yeah.

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:04.900
I mean, oh man.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:10.000
When it comes to the the whole academic thing the go-to food

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.700
shops in the chat, she knows what I'm talking about the go-to

01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:19.900
is when for me just to show some of the the obvious bias is

01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:24.200
when academic agent got fired right back in like 2019.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:24.700
Do you remember that?

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.800
Do you remember the story there wasn't this President Sunday

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.300
related?

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.900
Yes, it was vaguely remember it remind me.

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.100
Yeah, so academic agent.

01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:40.400
He ran like an anti SJW YouTube channel the back in that era

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.400
of YouTube and he was definitely like a center-right type

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:43.800
of guy.

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:48.000
But President Sunday back in the day.

01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:50.900
This is in years and years and years ago got together a crowd

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:54.000
of people to send a bunch of messages to his University

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.700
because he was a professor at a University in the UK.

01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:01.100
So they spam the University with various reports and they

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.700
said this in this guy.

01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:04.400
He's a threat to your students.

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:07.300
He's far right and because the UK is way more sensitive

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:10.800
to the sort of stuff in America is he lost his job and

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:13.200
he can't he still has some connections in publishing.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.400
So he's been publishing new books, but he doesn't teach

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:15.800
anymore.

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:18.800
Like he was he was kicked out of academia despite having

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.500
his PhD.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:22.100
It's like that sounds ridiculous in my opinion, even though

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:25.100
I just I don't agree with him and I mean since being isolated

01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:28.000
academic agent has radicalized very far right, but I don't

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
necessarily blame him for that because no one came to his

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.300
offense except for the right wingers.

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.000
Yeah, that that's how that works.

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:36.000
This is a tale as old as time right you kick them out.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.500
So there's no one no one sane will associate with them and

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.500
well, who are they going to who they're going to turn to

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:46.500
because they're not going to cease to exist, right?

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:49.300
They're just go with the people who will listen and talk

01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:52.100
to them and they ain't going to get pushback on their crazy

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:53.000
ideas anymore.

01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.700
But no, I think that it's just scummy all around that whole

01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:57.100
story.

01:47:57.100 --> 01:48:00.700
So so so the academic agent story is where I first started

01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:04.700
really paying attention to not just, you know, personal

01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:07.000
left-wing bias, which I experienced a lot when I was in

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.500
University myself, but also institutional left-wing bias

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:13.800
where the rules actually are just applied one way.

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:18.700
And so for me once I saw the the Harvard plagiarism story

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.000
that was just like another data point in a very long list

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:22.600
of data points.

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.500
I've been collecting for like five years now of just how

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.000
how left-leaning academia is.

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.200
And and there's probably some there's probably some natural

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.700
inclination for academia to be left-leaning because the

01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:38.000
right does tend to be more intellectual focused and the

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.800
left is like more blue-collar focus.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.500
So there's probably some natural probably some of the

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:47.200
left-leaning ness of it is just how it how it is naturally,

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:50.400
but I think a lot of it is definitely like artificially

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.500
imposed and they're rigorously gatekeeping other ideas.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:54.900
Yeah institutional capture.

01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:56.600
Yeah, it's this idea.

01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:59.300
Well, yeah, I'm on man's I won't explain it to you, right?

01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:04.500
You know what I'm talking about, but I I think it's getting

01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:08.800
better. I think that this is evidence of it getting better

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:12.400
because it this had happened in 2020.

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:14.800
We wouldn't have had the same outcome.

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.200
I think that funnily enough October 7th and the response

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:23.700
to it by a lot on the far left really just there is a

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.100
there's a there's going to be a divorce between certain

01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:32.000
segments left the people who cheered and the people who

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.900
who didn't on October 7th, right?

01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:39.000
I think that we're going to have a far-reaching.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.200
Yeah differences.

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:45.600
So what was what's really funny is like when I went through

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:49.000
my leaving the left moment, it was 10 years ago, right?

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:53.400
And October 7th was something that I knew was coming for

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.100
a long time now like not that specific event.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:01.900
But this idea this idea that liberals would eventually

01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:05.200
see the liberals who didn't get like slowly pushed into

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.200
the socialist camp.

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.400
The liberals would eventually see exactly who they buddied

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.200
up with during the 2016 to 2020 era because there was a

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:16.700
lot of just broad leftist unity in the face of you know,

01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.800
Trump getting elected and Bolsonaro and Brexit and there

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:23.600
seem to be the slow rise of the right-wing in liberal

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.800
democracies, which is still continuing in Europe.

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.500
There's no right-wing or right-wing parties are still

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:28.100
getting elected.

01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:31.500
I saw that happen in Argentina as well video recently.

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.200
Did you see that one where they're all doing the Nazi

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.000
salute or whatever?

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:35.300
Which one was that?

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:36.600
It was very recent.

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.100
I think it was Italy could be could be Spain, but maybe

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:45.100
like a huge crowd of people all just doing the Nazi salute,

01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:50.100
but yeah, so there has been this slow rise of the right

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.000
for sure.

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:54.700
And I think in least in the English-speaking world the

01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:58.800
broader left United in the face of that but then after

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.300
you know, Trump Trump lost in 2020.

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.500
They kind of had to figure out why they were together and

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.200
I think October 7th was I knew something like this would

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:11.000
happen where liberals realized why hey you actually don't

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.500
fit with leftist all that much.

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.100
I didn't know what it was going to be but it was going

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:15.200
to be some big event.

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.700
It turned out to be October 7th, right?

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.400
So I see I see Brianna Wu, for example tweeting stuff that

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.200
I was saying 10 years ago and it's like you're going through

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.000
the exact same thing.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
I went through 10 years ago.

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.700
The reason I went through through it 10 years ago is because

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.600
for me it wasn't a public event for me.

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.400
It was being in University and reading a lot of their political

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.600
theory and figuring out where it goes, you know, we all get

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:37.500
there in different ways.

01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:42.700
I like to hear a lot of different perspectives for me.

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.500
It's not so much a left versus right thing.

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:47.900
It's extremist versus non extremist thing.

01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:51.000
Like I can get I can get along with a right-wing moderate

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
right or someone who's a moderate and has very conservative

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.700
views. I would get along with that person but extremists

01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:02.200
on either side even even an extremist who takes all my values

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:05.100
everything I want but they're extreme about it and they're

01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.800
extreme about the ways they go about it.

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:07.900
It's something I don't want.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.200
I don't want to associate with.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:10.800
Well associates the wrong word.

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:13.700
I don't want to be on their team because I think that the

01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:19.400
extreme nature of how you engage with the world affects like

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:24.100
it takes everything you touch it twists and contorts things

01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:27.800
that I would consider values to be weapons in a lot of ways

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:28.900
and I don't like it.

01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:33.900
So speaking of a speaking of extremism food shops after

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:36.200
announced to you guys food shops is in fact coming becoming

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.300
a right-wing extremist.

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.900
She's going through it right now.

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:43.000
I want to she's been reading Mencius mold bug.

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:44.900
She's been reading Mencius mold bug and she's becoming a

01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:45.700
right-wing extremist guys.

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.300
You have to understand.

01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:48.700
I don't I don't want to talk about food shops too much because

01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:50.300
she can't defend herself on my channel.

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.500
She got banned because of the peto stuff.

01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.100
But uh, wait from your server.

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:54.600
She's banned.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.300
She can't come in.

01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:55.900
She's banned.

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:57.900
Um, I don't know what you mean about it.

01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.300
Was this your ruling or your mods or what?

01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:06.100
My mods, my mods and my admins made this decision.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.000
I haven't looked into the the I have seen I've heard some

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:11.500
of the clips.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:12.700
They don't look good.

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:16.600
I have been meaning to get around to talking to her directly

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:17.200
about it.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.400
Unfortunately holidays Etc.

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:22.400
I haven't yeah until I figure it out.

01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:26.500
I'm gonna hold this for I looked into it.

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:31.200
Yeah, and I mean the I looked into it and she just seems to

01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.900
be like schizo, which is fine.

01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:34.400
It's fun.

01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.200
But like like here's the thing.

01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.300
I don't think everyone's like she's a pedophile.

01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:40.000
I don't think she's a real pedophile guys.

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:45.100
I just think she has zero tacked zero ability to form a coherent

01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:45.700
sentence.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.800
No idea what when to not say the edgy joke and it's like,

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:54.000
okay, I did the clips I've seen and their clips to be fair

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:55.500
didn't sound like a joke.

01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:57.000
It sounded like her argument.

01:53:57.300 --> 01:54:01.100
Um, well also also here's the thing like like for me.

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.000
Here we can move away from food drops.

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:04.300
Thanks, Deb.

01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.500
She says in the chat.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.100
Okay, here we can move away from food drops.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.100
Like I personally don't care that much about the drawn

01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:15.000
lolly stuff because it's a drawing.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
It's like I whatever I don't care, you know, if you don't

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.700
like if you like it, I don't care if you don't like it.

01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:19.200
I don't care.

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.000
There are people who there are people who came over this

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.800
with the people who want to treat drawings as if they're

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.500
the exact same morally as real child porn.

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:27.500
I think that's ridiculous.

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:32.300
No, but it's like something can be worse.

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:35.400
But the original thing is still not good and not something

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:36.400
I want right?

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:39.500
Yeah, I don't I don't know.

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:40.300
I'd have to again.

01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:41.800
I have to talk to her at some point.

01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.400
Let's have the lolly debate with let's do it.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.400
We might have the lolly debate.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.200
We can do it right now.

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.400
We can we can monetize the shit out of it.

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.400
Why do it right now?

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.700
Well, we can make a production value of it.

01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:56.900
Dev as the defense attorney for food stamps, right comes

01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:00.000
on my show, right and then we'll have a prosecutor right

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.800
going and we'll and I'll be the judge.

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:06.100
I'll wear a wig will make some money and like if you if

01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:09.500
you super chat will get that'll be like the jury, right?

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:11.400
Well, it's super chat to do the journey.

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:11.700
Nice.

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.700
Yeah, it'll be great.

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:14.000
But let's bring another color.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.300
We've we've convinced that I want to get as many people as

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:16.900
we possible.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.200
I know I said one to two hours, but we got a lot of people

01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:21.800
so I don't know if you have anywhere to be or no, I'm good.

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.100
Let's go.

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.100
Okay, I can probably do do like one more hour.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:26.600
One more hour ish.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:26.900
Okay.

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:27.900
Well probably goes.

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:28.300
Okay.

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.200
We'll see how it goes.

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:32.800
But and you thought that this wasn't going to be interesting.

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:33.900
We have nothing to talk about.

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:35.500
You're foolish.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.200
Let's bring in the next contestant on whatever the fuck

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:38.700
this is.

01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:40.400
I still hope Brianna Wu shows up at the end.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.000
Maybe again.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.200
I'll send her another DM my alibi.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:45.900
Hello your life.

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:54.500
Oh, how about now?

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:56.000
How's good now?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
It's good greetings.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:58.600
Yo.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.900
Well, that's a lot to follow up of that was a good conversation

01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:05.900
and all that but I'll do my best.

01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:10.200
Well, yeah for us.

01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:17.900
Well, so one I was backing off a topic earlier because I had

01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:21.300
some interaction with it but like political labels where

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:25.300
liberal versus conservative people on the far left don't

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:27.400
like to call other liberals.

01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:30.900
They'll just call them conservative neoliberal use

01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:36.100
pejoratives and stuff and how again we can't even come down

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:40.300
to like simple facts on how to kind of label people or where

01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:41.000
they fit in.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
And like on the liberal side you have people who are pro Israel

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:52.600
and also pro Palestine, but then someone who might be pro

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.800
Israel a lot of extreme leftists won't like to call them

01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.400
liberal at all.

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.400
Yeah, so let's go ahead.

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:07.400
No, I agree with your point here.

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.300
Yeah, they go on continue.

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:18.100
So like where do you know it because also the PhD guy who

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:21.500
was on earlier and I enjoyed that talking about kind of the

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:27.000
processing of facts how stuff can be edited.

01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:31.500
How do you get people to come to kind of a common agreement

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.600
of what they call liberal or conservative and like just

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:41.800
because you don't agree with one liberal position doesn't

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:44.500
mean you're conservative and again, you're just bad faith

01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:48.700
if you're so I think this is a this is a problem about people

01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:52.500
swallowing an identity and making their identity or their

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.800
political party part of who they are as a person.

01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:00.400
I have certain values right that I believe in.

01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:05.400
More leftist progressive kind of things tend to fit with

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.000
most not all but most of those values tend to align with

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.200
them if that ever stopped being the case, right if that

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:16.400
ever changed I wouldn't follow the label.

01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:21.300
I would follow the value and I think a lot of people are

01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:25.800
the opposite of that they are invested in saying hey, I'm

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:31.100
a leftist or I'm a this and so if you are not this right

01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:34.000
if you don't have the same beliefs I do you cannot be a

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:40.300
this and even when those parties change or those tribes

01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:45.200
change they will cling to this and so they try to kind of

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:49.900
like gate keep the word or gate keep the label and push

01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:53.200
people out that they disagree with and keep a pull in that

01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:56.400
they don't but I don't get tied to it like that.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:58.200
So to answer your question.

01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:00.800
How do we get people to come to a common understanding?

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:03.700
I don't I don't give a shit what someone says it's conservative

01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:04.100
or not.

01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:05.900
I'm like, okay conservative cool.

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:07.300
What are they actually saying?

01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:09.900
What's their proposal right?

01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:11.200
What are they advocating for?

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.900
Is that good or is that bad?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.400
It's very simplified way of thinking it but it is what it

01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.100
is then I'll be okay with it or not.

01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:20.200
I don't I don't care if they call it conservative or not.

01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:23.100
What do you know that's a hundred a hundred percent fair.

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:27.600
I would say even growing up when talking politics with my

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:30.500
family, they would always like to label me.

01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.500
Oh, wait, you are are you conservative you libertarian

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.800
you neoliberal and I always kind of yeah shocked those

01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:41.500
labels and much rather like what's your opinion on this

01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:42.100
and this?

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.800
Because it can be very nuanced.

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:47.300
What do you think that?

01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:49.400
Yeah, pretty much.

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:52.900
I mean, I'm kind of feel the same way right if I if if my

01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:57.200
ideals like if society shifted in my ideals became known

01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:59.500
as far right then that's what I would be I wouldn't care

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:01.100
too much right or far left.

02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:02.200
I still wouldn't care too much.

02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.000
So okay, I guess I guess that's where I am.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.400
I guess I'm far left or far right now fine fine.

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.200
What matters are the ideas themselves, right?

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:12.800
And here's the thing when it comes to when you're arguing

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:15.700
over labels rather than arguing over ideas.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.100
What's really happening there is you're trying to place

02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.800
a moral judgment on someone right?

02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:27.000
So so for example, like when someone calls you a fascist

02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.900
let's say they're left-wing and they call you a fascist.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:33.800
What they're really saying is you're you are bad thing

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:36.300
and therefore you should you therefore you should be about

02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:37.700
it. It's a moral judgment, right?

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.700
And the issue ultimately the issue ultimately is that if

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:44.200
you were to actually meet a real fascist someone who genuinely

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:46.400
believed in those values and thought they were good.

02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:49.300
They wouldn't be insulted by you calling them a fascist.

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:51.100
They just be like, yeah, that's that's what I am right.

02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:52.900
They wouldn't it wouldn't be an insult.

02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:56.600
So the idea of attaching moral weights to labels and then

02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:57.600
slapping people with them.

02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.300
It doesn't really work and it really doesn't work to actually

02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:01.700
discredit ideas, right?

02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:07.800
Like everyone everyone everyone on Twitch poll, I think at

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:10.400
one point or another probably even including myself frankly

02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:15.000
has simply used fascist as like a sentence ender or like

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.400
like an argument ender where it's like, well, you believe

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.800
in X policy.

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:21.900
Well, that's a fascist policy and it's like well, what's

02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:22.700
the rest of the argument?

02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:25.500
That's the rest of the argument that's being smuggled in

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.700
there is fascism is immoral.

02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:30.100
So you shouldn't believe in this policy, right?

02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:34.200
But that's frankly not a good enough not a good enough way

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.300
to talk to argue him up.

02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:38.100
And I actually think this is a conversation win the argument

02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:41.200
for a long time though, but it's always I think it's not

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.900
good enough anymore getting to that point where people are

02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:43.900
seeing through it, right?

02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:46.800
Well, it ships the argument because you have to defend yourself

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.400
not being a fascist over whatever you were originally talking

02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:52.800
about. Well, there's there is that but there's also the fact

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.500
that you know seven or eight years ago.

02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:55.500
It was racist, right?

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.300
Everyone's like you're racist.

02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:56.700
You're racist.

02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.900
You're white male racist, but that got to a point where

02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:03.300
now no one gives a shit if you're called a racist sometimes

02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:04.300
they'll just be like, yes, I am.

02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:04.700
Fuck you.

02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:07.200
Just just like him to fuck off, you know, and then which

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:09.300
by the way one that has allowed a lot of real racist

02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:11.300
to get smuggled back into the conversation, right?

02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:14.700
But secondly it they've now had to shift to a different

02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:17.100
word and right now the word is fascist and we're approaching

02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:19.800
that point to where nobody cares.

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:21.200
It's not there yet.

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.700
Maybe another six months to a year.

02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:25.700
Nobody cares if they call you a fascist anymore in the which

02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:28.400
by the way one that allows fascist to come back in the

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:33.100
conversation, but to that offers no argument against fascism's

02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:34.900
here you go.

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.800
Here the optics go out the window fascism's positive qualities,

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:39.100
which it does have some right.

02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:42.000
So like you have to you have to balance this where it's

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.400
like you have to actually argue against the policies themselves

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:48.200
and not really care what label they're under the the winner

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:52.600
in the story of the boy who cried wolf was the wolf and

02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:58.100
you're exactly right the people when you are watering down

02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:01.700
and flattening a term so that it just has very little meaning

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:02.300
anymore.

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:06.000
It helps the people who are actually those things to as

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.200
you say get smuggled back into society because the accusation

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:13.200
holds no way because it's very important right when someone

02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:18.000
is doing fascist things that actually will be authoritarian

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
take away democracy take away people's freedoms of choice

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:22.600
take away people's free speech.

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.300
Etc to be able to tell people that and rather than go through

02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:29.800
a whole litany shorthand is useful.

02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:33.600
But again, we've over overplayed our hand.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:34.600
I agree with you.

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:35.100
Yeah.

02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:39.700
Actually here to to bring food shops back up again.

02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:41.900
I had a had this conversation with her like last week.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.700
Okay, and well, I was trying to explain this idea to her

02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:48.100
basically and it was basically that okay if you're gonna talk

02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:51.400
to a like a real fascist if you just because I think I think

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.200
she talked to Big Papa fascist at one point and like you

02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:58.000
can't just scream about how your opponent's ideals are immoral

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.500
because they don't share that that that view of it with you.

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:01.600
So it's not an argument to them.

02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:03.800
You have to she says in the chat.

02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:04.800
I live in dev walls.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.200
Fuck you.

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:08.000
Okay, so so listen listen what you have to actually do many

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:08.700
times you bring her up.

02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.200
So go ahead.

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:09.500
Okay.

02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:09.700
Okay.

02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:09.900
Yeah.

02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.900
Yeah, we have what you have to do is you actually have to

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:18.100
show how their own positive qualities are not fulfilled by

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.800
the Paul by the policies they want to implement right?

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:22.300
So for example, if you talk to a fascist and assuming he's

02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:23.000
honest with you.

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.600
He'll say that like order is a great positive quality in

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:27.300
society, right?

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.500
Like you want an orderly society.

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.600
That's why that's why they're so strict with things right,

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.800
but then you realize that once you what once you centralized

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:39.200
all power into the great leader into one person your society

02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:42.600
be that's a single point of failure for society, right?

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:46.100
So, you know hypothetically if Joe Biden is assassinated

02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:48.900
today America will have a crisis.

02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:50.300
It may even go to war.

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.400
However, your government doesn't collapse because you have

02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:56.700
chain of command you have succession things are set up and

02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:59.200
power is devolved to hundreds or thousands of different

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.500
people in hundreds of thousands of different offices all

02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:05.200
over the country, right if you assassinate Hitler Nazi Germany

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:10.800
dies and so when the fascist says I want order you have to

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:13.700
be able to show them that well you might want order but the

02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:17.400
way you set up your society is act does not actually guarantee

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:21.200
any order and in fact liberal democracies in their decentralization

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.100
guarantee more order, right?

02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:27.000
So there is in my opinion a good argument against fascism

02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:30.400
and I didn't once have to soy out about how immoral it is.

02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:31.700
You know what I mean?

02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:36.800
You didn't have to yeah, but no, thank you my alibi for calling

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:37.900
it a great topic.

02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:38.800
Great question.

02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:40.800
Is there anything else you have before we let you go?

02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:44.700
Um, no, not really that kind of covers it.

02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:48.800
The only other like before you throw me off into the void

02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:53.100
would say I would guess like while there are select few

02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:56.100
people who would welcome the label fascist.

02:05:56.500 --> 02:06:02.000
I think there are a lot of people that if the term that

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.400
would readily like deny it just because kind of like you

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:09.500
were saying they think morally different they disagree

02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:12.000
with you, but they're like the moral outcomes of what

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:17.200
their beliefs are wouldn't make them believe their effect.

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:20.300
Yeah, we're the one of the reasons we're so hesitant to

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:24.100
take a good conservative or good progressive or good leftist

02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:30.200
whatever whatever ideology you think of as bad is because

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:34.200
we have spent so much time and so much so much blood sweat

02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:38.300
and tears has been spent as tying that political label of

02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:39.900
our enemies to be evil.

02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:43.600
And so they can't have a good idea because they are evil

02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:47.700
and this is a problem and it's made it very very hard to

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:51.000
work with each other and very very hard to work across

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.300
the aisle every time someone on one team or the other tries

02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:55.600
to work with the other team.

02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:58.700
They are seen as traitors in a lot of ways to and are often

02:06:58.700 --> 02:06:59.500
primary now.

02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:01.000
It's a big problem.

02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.600
It's something we have to I don't know what to do about

02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:05.700
it, but it's something we're going to have to deal with

02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:06.900
at some point, right?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Well another part of the another part of this conversation

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.100
though something you mentioned earlier my my alibi is that

02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:15.200
they wouldn't say that they're fascist and a lot of that

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.300
comes down to like if you were to like go to Nick Fuentes,

02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:19.300
for example and say are you a fascist?

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:21.800
He'll probably say no and what he'll say is you mean I'm

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.300
obviously not you know, a member of the Italian fascist

02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:28.800
party or the Nazi German party, you know because fascism

02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:33.100
today looks very different from fascism back then right

02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.800
and because ideas do change and like like the liberals of

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:37.400
today are not the same thing as the liberals of a hundred

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:38.200
years ago, right?

02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:42.600
So things do like there is a genealogy you can trace back

02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:45.000
through through political ideologies to see where things

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.700
came from but today's fascists are not the same thing

02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:54.400
as Mussolini in 1910 coming up with a new ideology, you

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:54.900
know what I mean?

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:57.600
So they would probably it's a word game.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.100
But if you're educated enough on why the policies are bad,

02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:05.500
you don't need to you don't need to do the moral condemnation

02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:08.300
educating ourselves as streamers.

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:09.200
What are you talking about?

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:10.200
What are you talking about?

02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.700
To the void to the void.

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.700
They kicked him out.

02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:16.200
I did.

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:18.000
Well, he I told him he's gonna go to the void.

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:19.000
I let him listen.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:19.900
Look listen chat.

02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:22.200
If you want to if you want to go down another rabbit hole

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:26.400
of weird fringe ideologies that like only if like a dozen

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:30.900
people actually follow go to the Wikipedia page for a

02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:32.200
narco nationalism.

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:35.500
Okay, narco nationalism.

02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:38.600
I've heard of narco capitalism, but narco nationalism.

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:39.000
Isn't that?

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Yeah, so yeah, so you have like a narco capitalism.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.500
You have a narco socialism, narco communism, syndicalism

02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:45.500
primitivism.

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:49.500
You can definitely find a narco nationalism.

02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:52.000
Okay, so okay.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.900
I I just this is like that.

02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:55.600
Yeah, I'll give you the I'll give you the tldr.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:58.900
Okay, so yeah briefly because I don't want to get National

02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:04.400
National anarchists syncretize ethnic nationalism with philosophical

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.200
anarchism in their support for a stateless society.

02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:11.700
So they they're against they don't want a state.

02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:14.900
They don't want a government but they do want a unified

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:18.800
society based on some sort of tribal lines whether it's

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:23.000
ethnic or racial or religious or something that unites

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.700
them together with like a very strict in-group out-group

02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:29.700
view of the world, but there's no government and no state.

02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:35.100
Okay, you know why we can just label all of those things

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:36.700
into the retarded category.

02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:40.100
Well, if you look at a lot of the people that left-wingers

02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:44.400
mistakenly call fascist nowadays, they do kind of line up

02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:47.700
with with an narco nationalist ideas, which is kind of fun

02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:49.200
because like like Nick Fuentes.

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.300
He definitely applies as an narco nationalist.

02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:54.500
I can I can have based on that very brief description you've

02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:56.800
given he hits a lot of the boxes.

02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:02.400
It's it's it's one of those things where it sounds I wonder

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.000
how many of people say that there are these things just

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.300
to sound crazy or to sound different or to be unique or

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:10.100
whatever right to be edgy.

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:10.600
Yeah.

02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:14.200
I'm sure you've seen like Twitter accounts or they'll post

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:18.600
like, you know this very specific type of this one leftist

02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:21.800
writer who's part of this one movement from some country

02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:25.300
70 years ago and that's the the specific strain of leftist

02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:28.400
thought I believe in and it's like we all know you're just

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:30.500
you're just sitting around on your underwear eating fucking

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:34.800
chicken tendies and watching YouTube streams of bread tubers

02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:38.400
and that's that's all you are true, but they got to make

02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:39.200
it sound good, right?

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.100
Let's bring on the next contestant on whatever the fuck

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:41.700
this is.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:50.400
Ali your life you are what a man what you got for us brother.

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:51.600
All right.

02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:56.600
So I was wondering societally I've been watching and I feel

02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:00.900
like things are going like more red pill blue pill, right?

02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:03.800
Have you seen elaborate on that?

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:06.900
Yeah in terms of dating in terms of like ideology.

02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:10.300
It seems like a lot of young people are really responsive

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:13.800
and they're really like hype to follow red pill ideology.

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:17.400
So the sneakers the fresh and fits of the world and I feel

02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:20.600
like in that war that's happening that cultural war.

02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:23.900
The only reason they're winning is because they have something

02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:26.300
to offer or it like seems like they have something to offer.

02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:30.600
So in terms of like money bitches cars profits all that shit.

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.600
That's what they have and the blue pill side has nothing

02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:33.300
to offer.

02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:36.800
So I feel like how do you combat that if you if you disagree

02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:40.500
with with the ideology that that works for young people

02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:42.900
specific is like specifically because if you're older you

02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:45.000
can see through the bullshit, but when you're young, it's

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
really flashing you're like, ooh.

02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:50.500
Well, I think this is a problem that solves itself as you

02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:56.400
said it appeals to very young set demographic generally

02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:00.900
and I think experience is the wisest teacher right and

02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:04.800
I guess it's cyclical because every generation says this

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:07.800
is like well, we know better than the generation that came

02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:10.500
before but I wish a generation that's coming after us would

02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:11.700
listen to our experience, right?

02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:13.200
So it's like a cyclical thing.

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:17.800
I think this is just a combination of social media the

02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:22.400
incentives for that combined with like a noise amplification

02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:26.200
of these very specific ideologies.

02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:31.300
I I don't worry about it too much because I think that at

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:36.400
the end of the day the because when you say red pill that's

02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:37.400
way too broad.

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:39.000
There are some red pill ideas.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.700
I actually agree with well, I wanted to say conservative

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:44.200
and liberal but it wasn't I don't know if it's necessarily

02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:46.400
that yeah again, that's way too broad.

02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:53.600
Again, because it we have we can't think of it as so binary

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:56.600
as all that I think that there's a lot of people who are

02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:03.100
pointing to structural issues that men have in in culture,

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:07.700
right in Western cultures and dating cultures that are just

02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:12.700
true, but then they'll try to sell you a false kind of fix

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.100
and I think that what the blue pill could do quote-unquote

02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:19.500
is simply expose that and say now these they're lying to you

02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:23.800
and this is how and also we need better and I know this is

02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:28.800
maybe cliche to say but we need better role models on the

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.300
more left-leaning spectrum that a don't get exposed as a sex

02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:36.300
pest. Okay, that's a big one that we're having a problem

02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:43.100
with for whatever reason and P they need to be able to show

02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:45.000
hate to be able to explain.

02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:49.200
Okay, you may be struggling now, but I promise after high

02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.700
school it gets better because I didn't get many bitches

02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:52.300
in high school.

02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:53.400
But look at me now.

02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:55.800
Okay, I got my own YouTube channel.

02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:59.900
Are you getting tons of bitches now with look I'm swimming

02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:00.700
by the troll.

02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:01.900
Okay, moving me.

02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:03.800
Well here here.

02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:05.300
I'll jump in here, right?

02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:08.600
So on some level what you're describing is I think just

02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:13.700
impossible young people will always be attracted to radical

02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:16.700
ideologies is just a part of growing up and there's

02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:18.200
psychological reasons for this right?

02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.400
Like if you if you read like Piaget's work on developmental

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:26.900
psychology, you realize that the experience of going through

02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:30.400
puberty and experience and you're just personally experience

02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.300
massive radical changes that are like half out of your control

02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:41.000
that experience tends to lead young people to also realize

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.500
that a lot of society should also go through radical change

02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:49.100
so that they may fit into society right because they are

02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:51.100
different from the old paradigm.

02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.700
This is a very common thing that people go through when

02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:55.600
they're in their late teens in their early 20s.

02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.600
It's just it's a part of human psychology and generally after

02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:02.800
they go through this this phase of wanting to radically

02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:06.600
reorder the world sometimes they do actually end up having

02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:08.100
good ideas and how to reorder the world.

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:09.600
Sometimes the ideas are bullshit.

02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.000
Sometimes they do reorder the world.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.400
Sometimes they don't but either way after this psychological

02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:15.400
period is done.

02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:19.700
They tend to be more amenable to fitting into what society

02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:21.400
is in reality.

02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:24.600
And that doesn't mean that older people can't enact change

02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:28.900
they can but but basically there we are psychologically primed

02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:35.000
to want to engage in revolution in in in let's say our early

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.400
adult life and I guess that makes sense because if there

02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.600
was a change that needed to be made that's when we are young

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.300
enough and strong enough and capable enough to to do it.

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:45.100
So I guess it makes sense.

02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.400
It would happen then but also you lack the wisdom to be able

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:47.900
to do it, right?

02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:53.200
So on some level you can't like outside ideologies red pill

02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:57.000
stuff socialism even fascism, whatever it is stuff that is

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.600
not the current social norm that will always appeal to young

02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.100
people.

02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:06.800
It will always draw them in the only thing it was.

02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:07.100
Yes.

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:07.600
Yes.

02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:13.000
So the only thing you can really do is to understand that

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.300
a lot of young people will be doing this and that your society

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:20.200
is properly structured that they have viable off-ramps to

02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:22.700
rejoin society when they're done with it, right?

02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:23.400
So it's like, okay.

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:25.400
Yeah, you were LARPing as a revolutionary when you were in

02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:28.000
high school or when you were in college, but you have a

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.700
college degree now and you can actually get a decent job

02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:33.200
and you can actually, you know, find a girlfriend and buy

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.000
a house and become a regular member of society as long as

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.300
society is structured to grant some leeway to people who

02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:43.700
are going through this phase and still provide them with

02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:47.900
ways to integrate into society and and frankly even take

02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:50.600
on some of their new ideas if they have if they happen to

02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:53.700
be worth some something as long as our society is set up

02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:57.500
like that, then they will naturally de-radicalize on their

02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:00.800
own. But if our society is not set up like that and there's

02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:02.700
some evidence it's not currently set up like that.

02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:05.600
That's when you start to have lifelong revolutionaries and

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:07.600
you start to have massive social upheaval.

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.500
And I think that's the current problem facing liberal democracies

02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:11.000
right now.

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:13.400
Response.

02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:16.500
Okay understood.

02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:17.900
I was just saying I'm just saying it.

02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:22.100
So I from what I understood you feel so from what I got then

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.900
the society is pretty liberal right now.

02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:26.200
So then the radical thing would be to go conservative and

02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:27.900
everyone's just going conservative and you think that'll

02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:30.500
even out in a little bit or you think that the conservatives

02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:34.000
offer the conservative conservative side actually offers

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.500
something structural for people to like respond to it's both

02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:41.400
it's both right conservative critiques of liberalism.

02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:44.100
There there does seem to be a fair amount of meat on that

02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:44.600
bone.

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:48.400
So it's not like they're just there's radical for the sake

02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:52.700
of being radical right, but as long as liberal society is

02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:55.300
capable of taking the good critiques and also taking the

02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:57.600
people that believe them those people will naturally

02:17:57.600 --> 02:17:58.900
de-radicalize right.

02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:01.300
So I guess the issue like for example, you look at like

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:04.700
people who follow and Andrew Tate as a good example, right

02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:07.400
and like there are young boys who are who are now, you know

02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:10.900
devaluing women and and chasing money and you know, they're

02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.300
not be like they're being alpha males, but they're not

02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:15.900
being positive examples of what an alpha male should be

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:16.400
right.

02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:17.000
That's that's big.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:19.200
Yeah.

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:19.800
Yeah that too.

02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:22.200
But like it like you can't deny that Andrew Tate's an alpha

02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:24.400
male, but he's a very negative alpha male if that makes sense,

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:24.800
right?

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.300
So you have you have young guys that are that are looking

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.400
at that situation and in an ideal society, they would meet

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:39.100
maybe a decent woman who would be kind and interested in them

02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:41.500
as long as they themselves were of course able to attract

02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:44.500
her and then maybe they would have a real relationship and

02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:47.000
he would realize that, you know, the scales would fall from

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.600
his eyes and he would realize oh my God.

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:51.100
I've believed completely wrong things about women this

02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:55.000
whole time because you know having having a propagandist

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.800
tell you for years what women's true nature actually is

02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:00.000
and then when you finally fucking meet one for the first

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.900
time, you know, the reality of it isn't doesn't stand up

02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:07.400
to to the propaganda right, but if it's now harder to meet

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:11.500
women and it is and let's say the the ways in which you

02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:15.000
would traditionally meet women it's now become more taboo

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.700
to do like at work or at the gym or at the store and it

02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:21.600
is and maybe some of the ways in which you might meet a

02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:25.800
woman which is you know on an app the types of women who

02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:29.700
are on those apps they reinforce negative stereotypes of

02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:32.100
women rather than dispelling them and that also seems to

02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:36.700
be somewhat the case now you have like a cauldron where

02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:38.900
radicalization is only going to continue and there's no

02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:39.900
real off-ramp.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.800
It's just going it's just going to bubble up and continue

02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:46.100
to cook and so like it's funny because you see like a

02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:50.000
lot of let's say to be to be not so kind right-wing schizos

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
on Twitter who desperately want the trad wife, but none

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.500
of them are going to church right?

02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:57.400
None of them are going to church to meet any of the girls

02:19:57.400 --> 02:19:59.100
because those girls do exist there right?

02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:02.800
None of them are at University instead of partying.

02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:04.100
They're in the library.

02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:06.700
They don't even want them realistically they can claim

02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:08.500
that they want them but the end of the day they really

02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:10.900
want they want the hose that they claim that to hate.

02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:13.300
So it's just like it's the same thing with the Muslim

02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:15.700
if they want the four wives, but none of the people that

02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:18.200
none of the girls dads are going to approve of that marriage

02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:20.000
anyways to those people because you're not good enough

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:20.700
for that girl.

02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:24.500
Yeah, it's a you're correct dev when you say that there's

02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:25.900
like this kind of storm brewing.

02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:30.400
We haven't really learned to deal with the new reality

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:31.400
that we are in right?

02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:35.400
We haven't learned as a culture how to respond to and I

02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:38.000
hate to use this canard, but the social media problem

02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:40.200
and it is a problem and it's going to be something

02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:43.000
that we're going to have to figure out rules of the road

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.100
for right figure out ways to handle it and to adjust

02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:51.400
to everything being everywhere all at once and I think

02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:55.400
that one of the things that's going to have to happen

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.100
are a lot of these things that have become denormalized

02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:02.900
or stigmatized such as meeting people or talking to people

02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:07.600
at the grocery store or the gym right approaching people

02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:09.900
right that needs to become okay again.

02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:12.200
It used to be okay back in my day.

02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:14.200
It was okay, right when I was in my 20th.

02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.300
You just go up.

02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:16.500
Hey, I think you're cute.

02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:18.900
You want to go get a coffee sometime sometimes be polite

02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:19.200
about it.

02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:19.400
Now.

02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:20.700
Sometimes it'd be mean about it.

02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:22.300
Sometimes they'd agree to it, right?

02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:23.300
It really depended.

02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:30.600
We need to we need to stop stigmatizing that and the adults

02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:33.000
need to step up and say hey kids.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.400
I know sometimes when someone approaches you with something

02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:37.200
you don't like it can make you uncomfortable,

02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.400
but that doesn't make them a bad person that doesn't mean

02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:41.200
they're out to get you that doesn't mean they've harmed

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:42.000
you in any way.

02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:45.100
You can simply learn how to say no and her learn how to

02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:49.600
be assertive rather than weaponize your mental mental

02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:53.900
instability and weaponize your social problems and sort

02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:58.800
of an inability to be able to communicate and say that

02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:01.400
oh, well, they're the bad guy because they're asking me

02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:02.800
a fucking normal question.

02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:05.100
I don't know anything else for us Ali.

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:08.700
No, just back to my original point is just that doesn't

02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:11.500
sound as nice and glamorous as just do this and you'll

02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:12.700
get the you'll fuck bitches.

02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:16.200
Yeah, the marketing's got to change up.

02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:17.000
But thank you, man.

02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:23.300
What do you think of that social media take though?

02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:24.600
I'm really curious.

02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:28.500
I think that most of the problems we have today can be laid

02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:32.800
at the feet in one way or another of social media specifically.

02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:37.300
I mean when I was younger social media basically existed

02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:40.700
to help facilitate offline stuff.

02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:43.500
You get in touch with people so that you can go to a party

02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:46.400
together or that you could it was it was a tool but it wasn't

02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:47.300
your entire life.

02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:50.200
Now social media is people's entire lives and that's bad

02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:54.400
unless you're watching me on social media gang in which

02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:57.600
case you should like and subscribe to my channel and live

02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:00.500
vicariously through Wix discord.

02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:02.600
You can try my conversations.

02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:05.400
But yeah, listen, listen, if you super chat you can get

02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:07.900
this pair of social relationship going wick will actually

02:23:07.900 --> 02:23:09.700
be your real life friend Roo.

02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:13.600
Hey with enough money anything is possible friends anything

02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:14.000
at all.

02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:16.300
Let me bring on the next contestant.

02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:18.600
What you got for us?

02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:23.200
Gentlemen.

02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:25.200
Hello.

02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:26.600
Hi, you're live.

02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:30.900
Oh first and foremost, I've been listening for pretty much

02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:31.400
the whole time.

02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:32.200
So there's a lot of stuff.

02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:35.100
I kind of want to go back first back to you guys is like

02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:36.000
three guests ago.

02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:39.600
You were having a unilateral disarmament argument about

02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:42.800
how one side does something the other side is either forced

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:47.600
to or unilaterally disarming and wick said we live in a

02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:50.700
liberal democracy where you can go and say we're the side

02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:52.900
with morals and an ideal world.

02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:54.400
Thank you are a hundred percent, right?

02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:57.200
I wish we lived in that world but in reality we live in

02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:00.500
a very partisan atmosphere where you can tell your side

02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:03.100
where the moral people while also going out and being the

02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:06.500
scumbag and your side will find small reasons to stand

02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:09.700
up for you and damn the other side for very very similar

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:10.400
actions.

02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:13.100
So unfortunately practically that doesn't work out as well

02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:13.900
as I'd hope.

02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:17.100
Oh, it's not a it's not like it's not a panacea.

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:19.900
It's not a bomb of Gilead that will heal all our wounds,

02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:20.400
right?

02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:26.400
But in the long term like playing the long game over several

02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:32.100
iterations of elections of news cycles Etc.

02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:35.800
I stand by this it works.

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:40.900
There is a reason that we swung leftward after the 90s,

02:24:40.900 --> 02:24:44.900
right after the 80s and 90s where people saw that the right

02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:47.800
wing was full of shit on their free speech like they would

02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:52.500
ban books and all these things anti freedom anti video game

02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:54.900
and to all these things right the anti fun party.

02:24:56.800 --> 02:24:59.900
We took the wrong lessons from that and we think well,

02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:01.300
that's when they had power.

02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.400
This is what they were doing when they had power.

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:04.900
So it must be what works.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.700
So the left started adopting shit like that.

02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:11.800
Oh, yeah, that's a wrong lesson because that's that I would

02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:16.300
pause it is why they lost power and again a more liberalizing

02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:19.400
society more liberalizing culture and over the years we

02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:20.400
have been more liberalizing.

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.400
So yes, you won't win every election.

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:23.900
You may not win the next election.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.400
But again over a long enough period of time over several

02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:30.300
iterations, you will win if you stick to it if you can message

02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:33.400
control enough if you can again, there's a lot of ifs here.

02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:34.600
It's not a perfect thing.

02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:37.800
But if you can message control enough if you can take control

02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:41.700
of enough of your of your party of your ideology of your

02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:45.800
apparatus, whatever you want to call it and kind of say hey,

02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:46.900
these are our values.

02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:48.600
We don't fuck with our values.

02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:52.100
Even if it's politically expedient to do so no one's

02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:53.000
actually doing that.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.200
So it's probably yeah.

02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:55.600
I just didn't want to rehash the whole thing.

02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:57.100
I just kind of wanted to throw that point in there because

02:25:57.100 --> 02:26:00.000
I thought about it like you are correct technically, but

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.800
unfortunately practically doesn't work out as much like

02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.600
that as I hope the next point is dev was talking about how

02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:09.900
an inherent trait of fascism is an autocratic leader and

02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:13.600
looking at some of the ideals of fascism you can almost

02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:18.800
Implement or theory craft a way to have democratic fascism

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:21.400
where you wouldn't have that one autocratic central figure

02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:24.800
that the government lives and dies by I'm not endorsing it

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:25.200
or anything.

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:29.500
I'm just saying I could envision a retelling of fascism to

02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:34.700
be more of a congressional or parliamentary government as

02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:36.000
opposed to an autocratic one.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.500
Well, I mean Mussolini already did that right with the Grand

02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:40.500
Council of fascism.

02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:40.900
Yeah.

02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:41.400
Yeah.

02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:44.500
I'm so basically like fascinated.

02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:50.700
Well, what basically what it was was in Italy any Italian

02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:55.200
citizen could join the fascist party and then get elected

02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:59.600
to the Grand Council of fascism right now wasn't like it

02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.000
was a democracy and that people voted but it was not a democracy

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.700
because it was a one-party democracy right like you had multiple

02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:10.900
different strains of fascism that were competing but no one

02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:13.100
who is not a fascist could be in the government if that

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:13.900
makes sense, right?

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.000
So like it was it was kind of democratic right, but but it's

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:23.300
still ultimately all of that like under structure still ultimately

02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:26.400
hinged on Mussolini being in control of everything and once

02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:29.400
Mussolini was gone the entire thing collapsed to you.

02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:32.800
I agree with you a hundred percent but like the he in a sense

02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.300
it's because they're going through the change still once

02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:37.800
you have that government established and you have that machine

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
well-oiled enough to sustain on its own it might take a couple

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.800
of decades, but I could see I'm just saying hypothetically

02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:46.700
I'd see a version of fascism that isn't Central the Rock centralized

02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:49.700
around one person in the state that it actually worked in which

02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:53.000
I could argue that like, you know, like South Korea kind of

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.100
did you mean North Korea or no South Korea wasn't the where

02:27:58.100 --> 02:28:00.800
they considered one of the seven fascist governments in the

02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:01.800
world at one point.

02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:04.000
I don't think so.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:04.400
Look it up.

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:05.300
Might be true.

02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:06.700
I don't have to read the book.

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:07.200
Let me see.

02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:07.800
Let me see.

02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.500
I know like Portugal and Spain were Romania Germany Italy

02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:14.100
Japan.

02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:21.100
I mean South Korea and and Taiwan both had nationalist governments

02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:25.300
in the face of of like their like the socialist parties taking

02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:28.600
over in Japan North Korea and then in China, right and they

02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:30.900
had nationalist governments that eventually transitioned into

02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:31.900
liberal democracies.

02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:34.500
But were they fascist?

02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:36.200
I'm not sure maybe it's possible.

02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:38.000
I have to check the reference.

02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:39.400
They weren't fascist.

02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:42.700
It was a nationalist saying like I forget the guy's name, right

02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:46.200
there their leader whatever they got kicked out.

02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:48.400
They lost the war and they got kicked out to Taiwan to kind

02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:50.300
of like as a last bastion and stuff.

02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:55.600
But yeah, that kind of went away as well after the leadership

02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:59.100
died. So yeah, so those were just two honorable mentions.

02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:00.700
I wanted to my main point.

02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:03.400
My main point is that we don't really have conservatism in

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:04.500
the United States anymore.

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:07.500
We have newer versions of liberalism versus older versions

02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:08.300
of liberalism.

02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:11.400
If you look at a lot of the history behind the libertarian

02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:13.800
movement, this would go back to like the Mises Institute

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.800
writings and such.

02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:16.900
I like Tom Woods if anyone's ever heard of him.

02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:20.500
He's a really educated libertarian libertarians left the

02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:23.600
Democratic Party around the time of World War Two because

02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:28.200
they saw FDR as too autocratic of a leader for their ideals

02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:31.400
and they slowly drifted to the right wing and the right wing

02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:33.600
kind of has an idea of respect for institutions.

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:38.100
So they cut out their own anti-government quarter of the

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:40.300
right wing that actually kind of became a staple of the party

02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:43.600
now. If you look at the inception of the Neocons, Neocons

02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.300
were liberal Democrats for a long time.

02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:50.500
They shifted away from the party when who was it Reagan?

02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:52.600
I think they the first time they voted right wing was for

02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:57.100
Reagan. And so they shifted into more of it was actually

02:29:57.100 --> 02:29:59.000
meant as a pejorative and same thing with neoliberal.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.700
These terms were originally pejorative and became the names

02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:04.100
of these movements because they were people that switch

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:07.000
sides when the Democratic Party went a different way like

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.300
I said during that discussion.

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:10.900
I think they're still pejorative, right?

02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:14.800
You know, you don't say neoliberal or neoconservative in

02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:15.900
a positive sense.

02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:17.400
I've never heard that right?

02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:21.700
Yeah, I mean neoconservative is how like John Pott Horitz

02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:23.000
at the commentary magazine.

02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:25.300
His dad was one of the founders of the neoconservative

02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:27.700
movement. He uses that term as endearment.

02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:29.000
He's proud of it.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.600
He just wrote a few months ago.

02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:31.800
That's the exception.

02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:36.100
And it doesn't doesn't Francis Fukuyama use neoliberal

02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:37.000
positively too?

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:39.700
I think they're used positively a little bit. Fukuyama ended

02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:41.300
history. He can do what the fuck he wants.

02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:42.100
Okay, right.

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:46.000
liberal happily like I'm pretty pro-interventionist and

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.900
such so I would consider myself a neoliberal because I have

02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:52.300
the core values of liberalism, but I also support that.

02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:54.300
Uh, what's the word?

02:30:54.300 --> 02:30:56.000
It's not meritocracy.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:57.400
It's a fuck.

02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:02.100
Technocracy the technocratic the status that the current

02:31:02.100 --> 02:31:05.600
Democratic Party holds where they have a democratic elite

02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:08.600
ruling elite, but they're made up of professionals that earn

02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:09.500
their way there through merit.

02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:11.900
Are you part of the only my friend?

02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:15.100
No, no, I just support the fact that we need I'm a big about

02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:19.500
specialization and think are you are you in the car?

02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:21.100
That's what it sounds like.

02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:22.100
He's like he's in a car.

02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:24.100
Are you being are you okay?

02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:29.900
Oh, come on Easter has camera.

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:32.100
I don't look I'm worried.

02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:35.100
I'm concerned the camera is loading up.

02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:38.600
I can't hear them either.

02:31:38.600 --> 02:31:40.700
Can I okay buddy?

02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:42.700
Well, thank you.

02:31:43.100 --> 02:31:44.300
Thank you for calling in.

02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:47.300
I wish he has gone to an accident.

02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:47.800
Maybe more.

02:31:47.900 --> 02:31:48.700
I hope not.

02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:49.600
I hope he's okay.

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:51.100
That would be a feel really bad.

02:31:52.100 --> 02:31:53.600
But I'm sending him to the way for now.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.500
Um, I'm being told me think about let me think about that

02:31:57.500 --> 02:31:58.000
for a minute.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:58.800
What do you just said?

02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:02.000
It's like I mean, he said like he might have been like an

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:08.600
NRX or something maybe but but I don't know I like what he

02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:12.100
was saying was technically true like America's Republicans

02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:14.600
are like older with with the exception of the Trump faction,

02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:17.200
which is something new but like Americans Republicans before

02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:20.500
Trump were like older liberals and then the Democrats were

02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:24.500
like newer liberals if that makes sense like conservatism

02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:28.500
as an ideology is just whatever the status quo is and so

02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:32.400
for America because classical liberalism is the status quo

02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.600
your conservatives are classical liberals, right?

02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:36.500
However, if you if you're a conservative in the United

02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:39.300
Kingdom, you're a monarchist which is different.

02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:42.800
So I think it might be a little more nuanced than that.

02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:43.200
Right?

02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:45.900
I think that there are things such as conservative values.

02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:51.700
I think that transcend the status quo, but I haven't thought

02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:54.800
enough about it to really give it an educated kind of take

02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:55.100
on it.

02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:57.500
But this is just my instinct to be clear.

02:32:58.300 --> 02:33:03.200
I think that look at the end of the day.

02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:08.700
I think that there are more people today at least that vote

02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:13.700
against things and they are that vote for so there is a lot

02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:18.300
of people who are anti insert whatever here anti-right-wing

02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:20.300
anti-left-wing and that's how they vote now.

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:23.900
They don't really vote for positive things anymore, but

02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:24.800
that's just my instinct.

02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:26.200
I don't have a point.

02:33:27.100 --> 02:33:30.800
Not me that sounds about right to be like in retrospect.

02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:34.600
I'm actually quite certain that the main reason Trump won

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:39.100
in 2016 is not because he was actually considered a better

02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:42.900
candidate is that people really did not like Hillary Clinton.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.400
Well, they did not like the status quo.

02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:46.800
They didn't like that too.

02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:51.300
The it was a I think Michael Moore described it as a firebomb

02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:53.400
into the electorate right like that.

02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:56.300
A lot of people just wanted to change shit.

02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:59.800
That's why Bernie got close to Bernie Rose to National

02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:03.400
Promise prominence, even though he was a politician for decades,

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:03.800
right?

02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:10.300
He ran the reason he became kind of like this cause celeb

02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:14.900
for a lot of people is a lot of people just do not like how

02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:15.900
politics are right now.

02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:19.800
They hate it trust in our institutions is dipping.

02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:23.100
It's it's going lower and lower and lower every year.

02:34:23.300 --> 02:34:28.500
They're perfectly valid reasons for that and there's some

02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:31.400
some more silly reasons for that right?

02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:35.000
It's beyond the scope of this discussion, but I think that

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:39.700
like the Venn diagram between Bernie voters and Trump voters

02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:43.900
is bigger than you think for that reason is because both

02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:48.100
candidates are seen as a fuck you to Washington, right?

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:50.500
There's a fuck you to the establishment.

02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:54.100
So there's a lot of other things would have voted for Bernie

02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:54.900
instead, right?

02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:58.900
The main reason why I think Biden won in 2020 is because

02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:01.600
after the fuck you vote, you know, we're not going to just

02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:04.900
accept Hillary versus Jeb and no matter what happens.

02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:07.100
We're you know, we get the same thing just with different

02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:09.900
colors on it and we are going to choose something outside

02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:12.400
the paradigm and they chose Trump and they had four years

02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:16.000
of that and a lot of people I think realized oh shit at least

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.900
what's out outside the paradigm in this this instance was

02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:20.200
really fucking bad.

02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:23.400
Yeah, maybe the paradigm hat is it has a reason to exist.

02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:26.400
So I think that's why things swung back in 2020.

02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:27.300
Yeah, they realize.

02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:30.300
Oh, no, we wanted change but not this change gang.

02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:32.800
Please help and no, I think you're right.

02:35:33.100 --> 02:35:34.900
Let's let's get through as many people as possible.

02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:36.200
We only got a little bit of time left.

02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:40.500
So we're going to rapid-fire these extra high.

02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:46.600
Well, good evening gentlemen me howdy.

02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:47.100
What's up?

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Well, first of all Dev.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.200
Thanks so much for staying some extra time.

02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:56.600
I'm on the west coast over here and I just got off work.

02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:01.700
So happy to have a chance to come in and say hello and second

02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:04.300
of all there's a hundred and six people watching now on YouTube

02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:06.300
and there are 16 likes what is wrong with you?

02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:07.500
Get on.

02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:10.000
I don't know why people don't like my shit like this is a

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.800
thing. This is not new to my experience.

02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:16.000
You sound defeated wick.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
I am defeated.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I've tried different things to get people to click that

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.400
goddamn like button, but for whatever reason they I'm stymied,

02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:26.200
but it's okay.

02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:29.000
They still watch and I still I still get five dollars from

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.400
Artemis Fowl for to say then explain the current swing back

02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:32.500
in favor of Trump Dev.

02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:33.700
Don't worry.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:41.100
We'll talk more Artemis, but yeah, but anyway, what do you

02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:44.600
got to say enough glossing me and love glazing dev here.

02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:45.700
You can suck our dicks later.

02:36:45.900 --> 02:36:47.300
But for now tell us why you're here.

02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:52.300
Well, I think I like we're all we're all about changing our

02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:54.400
minds here in the in the wick chat.

02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:59.600
So I'd like to see if I can push dev a little bit about

02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:03.200
changing his mind when it comes to the idea that you need

02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:07.700
to censor in like teach a lesson so that then others know

02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:09.700
what it was like to be censored in the first place.

02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:12.300
There was a few callers back now, but I'd like to push

02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:12.700
you out of that.

02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:13.200
All right.

02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:14.100
Okay, go ahead.

02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:18.700
I don't know first of all if that can apply to populations

02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:21.800
rather than like single individuals, right?

02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:24.600
I can teach somebody that what they did was wrong by doing

02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:26.600
it to them and like having them experience it.

02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:30.100
But if I as a singular actor as a part of the left have

02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:33.100
never done anything to censor and then get censored as a

02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:36.400
retaliatory act then I have only all you've ever done there

02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:39.700
is create another victim somebody who already now hates

02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:42.400
the other side once again and you continue that cycle of

02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:43.900
hatred. So what are your thoughts on that?

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:45.700
I mean, I agree.

02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:48.300
Yes, you do have to do it on an individual level, right?

02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:52.000
So for example, if you look at the people the reason we had

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.700
this conversation initially was because there were prominent

02:37:54.700 --> 02:37:57.800
left-wing Twitter accounts getting banned one of them was

02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.500
that fucking squirrel person who's like ridiculous, right?

02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:04.200
They have done their share of censoring and now that they

02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:06.800
are being censored as like, okay, maybe you can learn your

02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:07.600
lesson, right?

02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:10.700
You shouldn't just censor people who haven't done any censoring

02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:12.400
even if they're aligned with other sensors.

02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:12.800
That's true.

02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:13.200
Yes.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.200
Okay, and then secondly they mentioned something about

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.500
going back to war games and that there's no winning move

02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:25.900
in a war game and I'm sure being people of the internet.

02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:27.800
We're all familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma.

02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:31.200
There's a couple weeks ago now a Veritasium video about

02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:34.700
it and the Prisoner's Dilemma has winning outcomes.

02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:39.800
The first initial winning move is a tit-for-tat where you

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.700
only reply in kind to any offense that's done to you.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:44.700
Yeah, I saw this video.

02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:45.400
Yeah, I know you're talking about.

02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:48.300
Yeah, and then but generous does better than that right

02:38:48.300 --> 02:38:51.400
occasionally giving back in and saying okay this time.

02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.700
I'm not going to attack back even though you did to me that

02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:54.500
does even better.

02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:56.900
So do you have any argument against that?

02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:01.600
So not not really because it does seem to be pretty much

02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:05.300
true, but even in generous there is a point where you must

02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:08.300
strike back and you cannot simply take it and take it and

02:39:08.300 --> 02:39:12.600
take it and take it eternally and then do nothing right like

02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:16.500
even it within generous like if you could take it eternally

02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:23.300
if you I think even for the generous the generous algorithm

02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:26.400
if it was faced with an algorithm that would simply attack

02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:29.900
it relentlessly without any without changing a strategy

02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:30.200
at all.

02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:32.900
It would still attack back like it wouldn't it was it was

02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:34.400
not eternally generous, right?

02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:37.300
So there's there has to there has to be some limit where

02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:39.300
you say, you know what, you know, I've given you a few

02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:39.800
chances.

02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:42.300
I've forgiven you a few times now you do actually have to

02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:45.600
be hit back like you can't you there's no there's no pacifist

02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:46.500
option here basically.

02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:48.600
All right.

02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:50.300
Well, that's everything I had for you guys.

02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:51.200
I appreciate you so much.

02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.800
We're doing we're doing rapid-fire gang.

02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:54.200
So extra thank you for calling in.

02:39:56.900 --> 02:39:58.900
Well, I see so yattle in the chat.

02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:01.400
I've seen is so yattle following me around.

02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:03.800
He's always in like things that I'm on viewer.

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:05.000
I don't know what to tell you.

02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:11.000
Yeah, he's been on my show to write like okay here to bring

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:12.000
up the Forbidden Topic.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
I was on food shops a stream and he was there too.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.600
So I'm just like is it is he following me?

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:18.900
Is that what's going on?

02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:21.700
He might be I mean that could be true.

02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:24.200
He could be a wick viewer and following you at the same

02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:25.000
time stalking you.

02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:28.800
I don't know but so yattle is just a nice enough guy.

02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:32.600
Let me bring on Tom Jones your life.

02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:37.700
Hello.

02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:38.600
Hi.

02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:39.000
Hello.

02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:41.700
Oh, this is exciting.

02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:42.700
This is rapid-fire.

02:40:42.700 --> 02:40:44.700
So let's uh, what you got?

02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:46.900
I just say a big fan of you dev.

02:40:46.900 --> 02:40:48.300
Anyway, so thank you.

02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:54.500
Should be very only recent discovered you like but you seem

02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:56.800
cool to you know, I'll give you that so it's quite the

02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:57.700
question could be very broad.

02:40:57.700 --> 02:40:58.900
I'll try to keep it narrow.

02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:02.300
So in society today, we've become increasingly secular,

02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:06.900
you know non belief in religion is on the rise and I want

02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.700
know if you guys think that is the problem considering,

02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:11.600
you know, pretty much every society throughout history

02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:13.300
has been very religious.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:17.800
What do you think wick?

02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:20.900
I'm gonna be real.

02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:21.900
I didn't hear the question.

02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:23.300
I was looking at the DM.

02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:28.500
Oh, it was it was about people becoming less religious over

02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:31.900
time. And if it's a bad thing, I think that it's had some

02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:33.300
negative consequences.

02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:34.300
I don't know overall.

02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:34.900
It's bad.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:38.400
Like I hear all the time about people lacking community

02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:40.100
about people being more atomized.

02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:45.700
I think that the going away from being religious is partly

02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:46.700
to blame for that.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.200
We used to meet every Sunday in a house of worship at least

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:54.500
in America, right less and less people are doing that and

02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:59.100
I think that has made it has had some negative consequences.

02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:01.400
I think that regardless of what you believe in the truth

02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:02.300
of religion.

02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:08.300
The communal aspect of it is helpful in a lot of ways not

02:42:08.300 --> 02:42:11.500
always there are some negatives to that too, but I think

02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:17.400
that a lot of people are seeing the reverberations of this

02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:22.000
destruction of communities and partly that sounds about right.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Yeah religion.

02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:28.500
So do you think is anything that atheists or more secular

02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:32.300
people can do to try and retake that concept of community?

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:33.500
Yes.

02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:41.000
Get off get offline, right and start actually meeting

02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:45.400
in person right a lot of the times what this would look

02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.100
like in non-religious circles is going to like Community

02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:53.000
Act activists stuff right like being involved in your community

02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:55.500
to make it better in other ways.

02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:59.300
Well another another benefit that religion had was the charity

02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:02.300
work. It did I remember being a young Mormon growing up

02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:05.700
and I would go every summer right we would go and we would

02:43:05.700 --> 02:43:09.200
do hurricane relief things and we would go as a church like

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:12.600
as a youth group to go clean up the community centers, right

02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:16.200
or clean up the parks or volunteer nursing homes Etc.

02:43:17.300 --> 02:43:21.000
More of that without the religion would be grand.

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:26.300
And so I think that yes a lot of people can we need to we

02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:30.500
need to incentivize people doing good for goodness sake

02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:36.400
right rather than doing good if it'll get me likes and updo's

02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:37.300
on social media.

02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:41.200
Yeah, I mean atheists have a rough time with this because

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:44.700
at least if you have God then you have a commandment to

02:43:44.700 --> 02:43:48.000
do it right there's some sort of universal moral force

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:52.400
that applies to everyone objectively and you can't really

02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:54.800
argue against that because it's the ultimate moral arbiter

02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:56.800
right but with a see a thesis that doesn't exist.

02:43:57.100 --> 02:44:01.900
So it's it's much harder to to get atheists to do some

02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:05.400
sort of community building without without that that moral

02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:06.200
force behind them.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:09.600
Anything else before we let you go?

02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:11.700
That's all thank you.

02:44:11.700 --> 02:44:14.000
I appreciate you guys and have a good rest of your night.

02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:14.600
Bye.

02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:15.200
Thank you again.

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:15.600
Thanks, man.

02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:20.000
$15 from pondering politics who's blowing up on YouTube

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:24.400
right away to say yes, he's getting more views than I I

02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:26.700
remember when I was a big boy, right and I was inviting

02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:28.200
him on my platform like hike it.

02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:32.500
I got 5,000 subscribers and now he's got like what 80,000

02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:33.000
or some shit.

02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:35.600
He's got a hundred and seven thousand.

02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:36.900
Yeah, it's blowing up.

02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:39.100
Like I said, so he's a he's doing well.

02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:41.600
Oh, this is this is ruminate, right?

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:42.900
This is Josiah.

02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:45.100
Well, I think you've talked to Josiah before have you?

02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:48.300
Change his name from ruminate.

02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:48.800
Yes.

02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:49.200
I think so.

02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:49.800
Yeah ruminate.

02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:50.000
Yes.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:50.300
Yes.

02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:52.200
This is running ask.

02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:55.500
I've I've I've spoken to him a little bit but only privately

02:44:55.500 --> 02:45:00.700
and primarily knowing him as ruminate now ask SFO to weigh

02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.500
in on Trump's legal argument today that he's entitled to

02:45:03.500 --> 02:45:04.800
absolute legal immunity.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.300
Even if he murders a political rival.

02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:08.700
That's ridiculous.

02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:10.900
Obviously, what is your favorite TV show?

02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:12.900
Have you seen the memes by the way?

02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:17.900
I saw this guy make an AI generation of Biden a seal team

02:45:17.900 --> 02:45:20.200
six assassinating a dude like shooting a gun.

02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:22.400
Yeah, so I think I saw the meme.

02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:25.700
Yeah, it was hilarious, right?

02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:30.300
Because that's the that's the kind of that's where that

02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:35.100
leads right if you think it's okay for a political person

02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:38.700
to kill their political rivals or order a hit on that.

02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:41.700
That's that's what's going to happen, right?

02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:43.300
And I it's not a world.

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:46.000
I want to live in so it looks like roommate you're doing

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.000
like the the daily, you know political take you know, not

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.500
I'm not comparing you to this person because for any moral

02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:56.000
reason it's just a similar type of content like like the

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:59.200
quartering right where you put out a video or like two videos

02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.100
a day and you just like kind of flood the algorithm with

02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:04.100
daily content and it's working out for you.

02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:04.700
Good job, man.

02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:05.800
I'm looking at your channel now.

02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:09.800
Yeah, like yeah, he's a small video.

02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:10.700
S is small video.

02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:12.100
S is there like a definitely way to go?

02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:14.200
I was doing it for a while and I got too fucking lazy.

02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:17.000
I've been too lazy recently, right?

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:22.100
That's my problem is as I enjoy doing this because I get

02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:26.300
to interact in a long form with people and to to send that

02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:28.500
like 10 minutes snippets.

02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:28.900
I don't know.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:34.200
Yeah, well, I mean I did it for a while and I want to get

02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:35.100
back to it.

02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:38.400
I am 99% after watching destiny go through the meth stony

02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:41.900
arc with with the the ADHD medication.

02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:47.200
I am like knowing knowing my own my own issues.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:49.600
I am like I'm very convinced.

02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:52.200
I probably have some form of adult ADHD and I should probably

02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:54.100
try out I should probably try out.

02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:55.100
What do you got himself on?

02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:58.000
Not simply like well, here's the thing where you see it a

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.900
lot and then suddenly you start having the symptoms because

02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:03.800
that's all you ever looking at and seeing I've had this for

02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:04.300
years, man.

02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:06.200
I've been like this for years and years and years.

02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:07.100
Yeah.

02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:08.900
Yeah, the self-diagnosis.

02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:09.700
Here's the thing, man.

02:47:09.900 --> 02:47:16.200
It's um, I spent years and years fighting through it and

02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:19.500
actually doing very well because like there were times where

02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:22.000
you know, I would leave the internet for like three months

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:23.600
because something went down now.

02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:25.800
I might have to take a day off of something bad goes down.

02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:29.600
Right there are times when like I couldn't focus on anything

02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:30.400
to get a video done.

02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:33.500
Like it took me like two months to get a video out now.

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:36.700
I've been able to like hit spurts of one a day or one every

02:47:36.700 --> 02:47:39.400
two days that last for a couple months and then I like relapse

02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:40.600
back into old habits, right?

02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:44.200
I definitely hyper focus on video games for like 16 hours

02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:48.000
a day sometimes and also coffee gives me that very calming

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.100
effect when it makes most other people jittery.

02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:54.500
What's the most recent video game you've binged out on?

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.100
Oh, Project Zomboid.

02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:57.300
Really that good?

02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:58.400
Yep.

02:47:59.700 --> 02:48:00.300
That's really good.

02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:03.500
I've been playing XCOM 2 and I've been busy.

02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:06.100
I've been spending more time making all the little streamer

02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:10.200
characters as the the people little XCOM agents, right and

02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:12.300
making sure that they're decorated correctly and things

02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:12.900
like that.

02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:15.400
I don't know what that says about me as a gamer, but that's

02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:17.700
been most of my experience and then I will play with them

02:48:17.700 --> 02:48:19.200
and see who dies first etcetera.

02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:20.600
Right, right, right.

02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:23.500
You're trying to sing social contagion.

02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:24.100
Here's the thing.

02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:27.700
It's not social contagion because I've recognized this in

02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:29.700
myself for over 10 years now.

02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:33.200
I just haven't been able to fully put it together until I

02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:36.000
watch Destiny go through like he had the same symptoms.

02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:39.800
He went through a very similar process and it's and like

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.600
you can say like copycat stuff because it's like a streamer

02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:43.400
you watch and they go.

02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:45.700
Yeah, I understand that there's definitely some danger of

02:48:45.700 --> 02:48:49.400
that but the fact that it that the symptoms he described

02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:50.900
are so similar to similar to mine.

02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:53.600
It's like maybe I and here's the thing you can go on for

02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:56.000
medication for a month and then be like this ain't for me

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
and then stop, you know, you're going to stay on it forever.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.700
You know guys like it's not one of those things.

02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:00.900
Right?

02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:03.800
So I'm going to go like it most medications.

02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:10.300
Yeah, I might give it a go and just see like if after a month

02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:13.600
like there's also some reports of people who go on ADHD meds

02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:17.000
and they they report like losing all their creativity.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:17.800
I wouldn't want that to happen.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:18.200
Right?

02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:19.500
So if that happens, I'll stop taking it.

02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:20.400
It's like, you know, it's pretty easy.

02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:21.400
Um, okay.

02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:24.100
To answer the actual question though, uh, Trump's legal

02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:26.300
argument today that he's entitled to absolute legal immunity.

02:49:26.300 --> 02:49:27.600
You know, he mirrors a political rival.

02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:28.600
Like that's fucking insane.

02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:32.200
Obviously there's no fucking, even if like, because of the

02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:35.100
way that some old law is written or something that's never

02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:36.100
going to hold up in court.

02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:37.500
Like that's, that's ridiculous.

02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:37.700
Right?

02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:42.100
Um, my favorite TV show, honestly, even though it's an

02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:43.400
anime, probably attack on Titan.

02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:47.200
Because I really like, I really liked it.

02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:50.000
I haven't, I haven't, honestly, it doesn't get good until

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.700
season two and then it gets exponentially good every season

02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:53.800
through two, three, and four.

02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:57.000
This is, is it on crunchy roll or whatever off the, yeah,

02:49:57.100 --> 02:49:57.600
yeah, it is.

02:49:57.800 --> 02:49:58.500
I'm pretty sure it is.

02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:00.300
Um, five more dollars from common cure.

02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:03.800
Um, again, I'm prioritizing since we're coming to the end.

02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:04.900
I'm prioritizing money.

02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:09.200
Uh, so if you pay me five dollars to say dev, please

02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:10.600
explain your thoughts on small towns.

02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:12.700
You were shitting on them the other day and I was wondering

02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:14.200
if you thought there was any hope for them.

02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:15.800
Okay.

02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:19.100
So what he means when he says that I was shitting on them

02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:21.900
the other day is I put out this tweet.

02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:23.100
Let's see if I can find it real quick.

02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:26.200
I'll do like a quick search of town or towns.

02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:26.800
Yeah.

02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:27.100
Okay.

02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:30.700
So I said that, uh, I grew up in a small town.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.200
Everyone was in your business.

02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:33.300
There was no privacy.

02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:34.200
There's no privacy.

02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:36.200
Infrastructure rollout was slow.

02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:39.200
People move away like crazy due to lack of opportunity.

02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:40.900
Small businesses regularly die.

02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:42.200
Drugs are rampant.

02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:44.700
And my small town is now a ghost town.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:48.400
Uh, the towns, one large employer finally pulled out, leaving everybody

02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:52.400
who stayed behind out of jobs, alcohol, alcoholism, and drug use is

02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:54.600
skyrocketing be on it's already high rates.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:56.100
The place was on its deathbed.

02:50:56.100 --> 02:50:59.200
Even before that though, there's no future in small towns.

02:50:59.300 --> 02:51:02.400
That was my take basically because of my experience growing up in one,

02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:04.800
you know, I moved away to the city because there was nothing for me there.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:08.300
And like half of my, half of my graduating class in high school moved

02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:11.400
away to some city somewhere in Canada, where it's a Toronto or Vancouver

02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:13.900
or, or Montreal or Ottawa or wherever.

02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:14.100
Right.

02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:15.700
They moved to some city and sort of died.

02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:20.000
Um, and then the half of them stayed behind and the half that stayed

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.400
behind the half of that half.

02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:25.800
Like they're now druggies and they've like lost their kids.

02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:26.800
I have them all on Facebook.

02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:28.700
So I'm like keeping track of the old drama back there.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Half of the half of the half that stayed behind are addicted

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.000
to drugs or alcohol.

02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:34.600
A lot of them have lost their kids.

02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:39.600
There's like public fights breaking out and people like it's just trashy stuff.

02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:42.900
And then the remaining half that actually did have steady jobs and

02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:44.500
were doing okay for themselves.

02:51:44.700 --> 02:51:47.900
Well, the town's one employer just pulled out and now there's no jobs

02:51:47.900 --> 02:51:49.100
and everyone lost their jobs.

02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:53.700
And it's like, you know, I understand that there's the, like the right wing

02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:57.600
has this very nostalgic view of whatever, like a, you know, the peaceful small

02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:01.300
town where everything's a little bit slower and everyone's friendly.

02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:05.200
That might be true some places, but in my experience, it's not true.

02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:08.400
In my experience, small towns are just places of despair.

02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:10.700
I grew up as a military brat, right?

02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:13.800
So I don't have no experience with city versus small town.

02:52:13.800 --> 02:52:16.400
I was always on a military base of some sort, right?

02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:20.800
Growing up for most of my, my childhood, um, since I have grown

02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:24.700
up, however, and have lived on my own, I'm now 40 fucking years old.

02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:29.200
I have lived both in the city and I have lived in very, very small

02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:30.400
communities, right?

02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:36.600
My preference is to live in the small community and visit the city, but

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:41.300
that's a, that's something where I've already, I have, I have, I have

02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:44.200
a job outside of my local area, right?

02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:46.900
So, um, Doing streaming.

02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:49.500
I can do that from the city where I can do that from the small town.

02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:53.100
I prefer doing it from the small town because less people bother me.

02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:57.100
Um, I like the feeling of, of being kind of away from it all.

02:52:57.300 --> 02:53:01.500
And if I need social interaction, which I do on occasion, I'll drive

02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:02.700
in and I'll slum it in the city.

02:53:03.500 --> 02:53:04.100
Oh, that's fine.

02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:04.300
Yep.

02:53:04.700 --> 02:53:04.900
Yep.

02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:09.600
I mean, I live like 10 minutes from downtown where I am and I am actually

02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:13.400
moving cities in the spring and where I'll be moving is about a half

02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:14.700
an hour from outside of downtown.

02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:17.100
So like it's, I'm still like in the city.

02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:19.800
I can still access all the amenities of the city, but it's like a

02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:21.400
quieter part of it, you know?

02:53:21.900 --> 02:53:23.300
So, yeah.

02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:24.400
Cool.

02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:26.000
Uh, five more dollars for fun.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.600
Do is Wicca tactics gamer.

02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:29.900
Also, please watch Freerun beyond journey's end.

02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:31.200
That's an anime.

02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:31.700
That's an anime.

02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:33.100
Okay.

02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:37.300
The current elf waifu who has the silver hair and the smug face.

02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:39.400
That's from the one that's on Twitter everywhere right now.

02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:40.700
That's Freerun beyond journey.

02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:42.400
I don't follow the same people you do.

02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:45.800
I don't see it unless it's a, you tweet, uh, I'll make sure to

02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:46.200
retweet them.

02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:46.900
Oh, well, thank you.

02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:50.800
Uh, five more dollars from Artemus Fowls say object to the

02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:53.300
characterization of the immunity argument and the stupid phrasing

02:53:53.700 --> 02:53:57.300
used by the Donator and Dev and five more dollars from Artemus

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:57.700
Fowl.

02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:00.100
There's nothing to argue the immunity arguments made by the

02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:02.500
Donator and Dev did not take place at this point.

02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:04.000
So here's the thing.

02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:07.000
I've been, I know that this was, this is related to pondering

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:07.600
politics.

02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:12.000
I've been arguing with Artemus in private now over the Jan six

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:12.500
stuff.

02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:15.000
And I was like, Artemus, listen, you've been sending me all this

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.400
evidence out, believe your evidence after examining it, but

02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:19.100
you like he, okay.

02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:21.700
I've seen Destiny talked to like Aidan Paladin who walked in

02:54:21.700 --> 02:54:22.900
with nothing and got destroyed.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:23.400
All right.

02:54:23.700 --> 02:54:26.700
I saw Destiny talk to Rob Knorr who did better than Aidan

02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:28.300
Paladin, but still got destroyed.

02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:34.100
But, um, Artemus is unironically presenting to me more evidence

02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:39.600
of the Trump side of the January 6th and election conversations

02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:41.800
than I've seen from anybody before.

02:54:42.100 --> 02:54:42.600
All right.

02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:46.000
So I do think that speaking to Artemus about this topic is

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:46.600
worthwhile.

02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:49.500
I still think he's, I think he's, I think Artemus is

02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:52.600
fundamentally wrong about them, but he's, he's like, he's

02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:54.700
actually bringing evidence that I haven't seen anyone talk

02:54:54.700 --> 02:54:55.600
about before, which is interesting.

02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:56.400
Yeah.

02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:58.400
So like, that's why I've said like, Hey, listen, Artemus

02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:00.800
probably should talk to Brianna Wu at some point.

02:55:01.100 --> 02:55:03.800
Artemus probably should talk to pondering politics at some

02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:04.100
point.

02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.900
I tried to set up Artemus versus Destiny, but artists wouldn't

02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:07.300
do it.

02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:09.500
Artemus, what are you doing?

02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:12.100
Come on, come on.

02:55:12.700 --> 02:55:15.200
Look, you're, you're a reasonable guy.

02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:16.400
You're a rational guy.

02:55:16.700 --> 02:55:18.600
You're a civil guy.

02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:21.600
We need more of that in this space, less screaming

02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:24.400
autistically and more civil reasonable.

02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:27.000
Here's evidence and we can argue over the evidence.

02:55:27.300 --> 02:55:28.200
That would be great.

02:55:28.500 --> 02:55:30.700
And pondering politics is down for it, right?

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
We could do a pondering politics versus the world thing

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:33.600
if you want.

02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:37.000
Like, do you want to do, do you want to do Artemus fallow

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:38.300
versus pondering politics?

02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:38.900
That'd be interesting.

02:55:38.900 --> 02:55:43.200
Yes, because so, so I pondering politics, I don't know if

02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:43.600
you heard me.

02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:44.900
I'll just repeat it very quickly.

02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:50.300
Artemus of the people who are on the pro-Trump side of January

02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:51.800
26th and the 2020 election.

02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:55.500
Artemus is probably the most reasonable person I've seen

02:55:55.900 --> 02:55:59.000
more so than anyone that Destiny's debated on his channel

02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:01.200
or that usually do these sorts of debates.

02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:04.000
Artemus does seem to be the most reasonable person of that

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.900
side, even though I think he's wrong.

02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:10.900
Still he has better arguments and he brings up more evidence

02:56:10.900 --> 02:56:11.700
than any of them.

02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:14.600
And this is to you Dev and I can set up this up with you.

02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:18.300
But if I think that to add to that and I'm not sure where

02:56:18.300 --> 02:56:22.500
I'd rate them, but are you familiar with a streamer small

02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:25.200
libertarian streamer named Lactoid?

02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:30.800
No, no, he's another he's a practicing lawyer, right and

02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:32.500
he has a very good grasp.

02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:35.700
We did a discussion on last year.

02:56:35.700 --> 02:56:39.500
I said as long time ago at the end of December with Pisco

02:56:39.700 --> 02:56:44.500
pondering politics Lactoid and a couple others about the Trump

02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:48.100
removing the Trump from the ballot in Colorado, right?

02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:49.900
He brings facts.

02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:50.800
He brings figures.

02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:53.500
He's a pretty reasonable guy.

02:56:53.500 --> 02:56:56.600
So you might enjoy if you enjoy Artemis Fowl, you might enjoy

02:56:56.600 --> 02:56:57.100
him too.

02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.700
Not to say you're not you're not a great guy.

02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:01.300
Artemus Fowl, we like you, Artemus Fowl.

02:57:01.300 --> 02:57:02.700
I just want to broaden our heart.

02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:04.500
Here's the thing, right?

02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:06.600
Like I do not know much.

02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:09.100
I mean, I know some of American law, but I'm not I'm no expert,

02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:13.500
right? My wheelhouse has always been political theory and

02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:16.200
to a lesser extent history and then of course video games,

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:16.500
right?

02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:17.700
That's unrelated to politics.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.900
But political theory and history is my thing.

02:57:19.900 --> 02:57:22.900
Like I can sit here and tell you the entire life story of

02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:23.600
Antonio Graham.

02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:24.700
She off the top of my head.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.900
I cannot tell you whether or not any of these indictments

02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:31.400
are 100% going to go for Trump or not, you know, like I

02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:33.800
can tell an arm is found even when he calls them like I'm

02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:34.400
not a lawyer.

02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:35.600
I can't argue these.

02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.800
I don't know, right?

02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:39.300
I just don't know and I'm not going to pretend I do.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:42.900
Artemis Fowl another five dollars.

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:45.700
I will inevitably be sided with by the courts and why destiny

02:57:45.700 --> 02:57:48.700
will be mad and blame the Supreme the corrupt quote-unquote

02:57:48.700 --> 02:57:52.900
Supreme Court think so so because here's the thing like

02:57:52.900 --> 02:57:53.900
there's here.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:57.800
Let's say that the best possible scenario is that the Georgia

02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:00.900
Rico case completely falls apart because of what Artemis

02:58:00.900 --> 02:58:02.800
Fowl presented at the start of the stream, right?

02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:06.400
The the person appoints the his her boyfriend and it was

02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:09.200
improper and something actually comes out of the meetings

02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:11.600
with with Biden and like let's say that everything falls

02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:12.300
apart, right?

02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:15.500
So the Georgia Rico case is now out isn't there still

02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:17.600
three more indictments against Trump?

02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:20.600
I'm pretty sure there's at least three more and the documents

02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:24.300
one looks like the documents one appears to be ironclad

02:58:24.300 --> 02:58:25.100
against Trump.

02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:30.000
So I'm just sitting here thinking like even if even if Georgia

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.300
Rico falls apart because of what Artemis presented earlier,

02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:35.500
like that's only one angle of attack against Trump right

02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:39.100
now. Yeah, but the classified documents case has the most

02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:41.000
favorable judge a lean cannon.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.800
So it's entirely possible between that and a favorable jury

02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:46.200
pulled it even though they have the debt to rights on the

02:58:46.200 --> 02:58:49.100
case during nullification to get in the day.

02:58:49.900 --> 02:58:50.500
Well, I think so.

02:58:50.500 --> 02:58:52.800
Well, hello, Josiah Potter in politics.

02:58:53.900 --> 02:58:55.200
You're going to be a last caller by the way.

02:58:56.200 --> 02:58:57.300
Hey, wait.

02:58:57.300 --> 02:58:57.800
No art.

02:58:57.800 --> 02:58:58.800
Artemis is in the chat there.

02:58:58.800 --> 02:58:59.300
Bring him in.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:03.000
We'll do it right now with right now.

02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:04.400
Hi Artemis.

02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:07.100
What's going on?

02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:08.900
Hey, dude, what's up?

02:59:09.600 --> 02:59:10.600
Oh, just hanging out.

02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:13.700
Also, you're in the room.

02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:16.900
Same room Josiah meet Artemis Artemis.

02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:18.600
Hey, we talked we talked before.

02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:19.200
What's up, buddy?

02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:21.600
But have you guys really actually on my show?

02:59:21.600 --> 02:59:23.000
Yes, I believe.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:24.400
Oh, oh neat.

02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:29.200
Oh, is this the the guy that said that the the crew people

02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:32.100
that brought the Colorado case were nonpartisan?

02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:35.200
That they are a non-profit.

02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:37.500
Yeah, that was that was not correct.

02:59:38.200 --> 02:59:39.800
They no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:59:39.800 --> 02:59:42.700
Well that they are a non-profit but they were the argument

02:59:42.700 --> 02:59:43.700
was that they were partisan.

02:59:43.800 --> 02:59:44.900
Now that they were nonprofit.

02:59:44.900 --> 02:59:45.400
They okay.

02:59:45.400 --> 02:59:48.500
So you were the guy who said the Democrats brought the case

02:59:48.500 --> 02:59:49.200
even though it was right.

02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:49.800
It was media.

02:59:49.900 --> 02:59:53.300
It was Republican and Independent voters who by the way

02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:56.700
are famously not Democrat Republicans are that the one the

02:59:56.700 --> 02:59:59.900
one Republican voter that seems to be voting in every state

02:59:59.900 --> 03:00:03.400
somehow and is bringing the case by a company owned by media

03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:03.900
matters.

03:00:04.300 --> 03:00:04.800
I don't know.

03:00:04.800 --> 03:00:05.600
So, okay.

03:00:05.600 --> 03:00:07.400
He's not they're not the party to the case.

03:00:07.400 --> 03:00:08.300
It's the Republican.

03:00:08.300 --> 03:00:11.900
They found they found they found a guy that would push it.

03:00:11.900 --> 03:00:12.300
Yes.

03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:12.600
Yes.

03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:13.100
Thank you.

03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:16.900
Case on the part on behalf of Republicans and Independents.

03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:19.500
We want to frame this as a strictly partisan issue.

03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:20.500
It is a partisan issue.

03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:21.100
Everybody can see it.

03:00:21.100 --> 03:00:22.700
That's why it's being thrown out everywhere else.

03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:23.100
Wait a minute.

03:00:23.100 --> 03:00:25.600
So it's a partisan issue when Republicans and Independents

03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:29.400
bring the case when media matters when media matters shops

03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:32.600
around and finds one guy that's willing to be it doesn't matter

03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:33.200
that they shop.

03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:36.300
It doesn't matter that they shop around Republican voters

03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:39.800
and Independent voters brought the case by definition you

03:00:39.800 --> 03:00:41.700
keep saying Republican voters.

03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:43.300
They literally found so okay.

03:00:43.300 --> 03:00:44.000
I should clear this up.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:44.700
I should clear this up.

03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:48.200
So Republicans are the people who vote typically for Trump.

03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:50.100
Okay Democrats are a different party.

03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:52.800
Okay, come on guys.

03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:55.100
You could you could do whatever you want say that but everybody

03:00:55.100 --> 03:00:58.200
I understand I know I have all these other state rulings.

03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:01.800
So Donald Trump is a Republican if that helps.

03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:02.900
He's not a Democrat.

03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:04.700
He's not even a Republican at this point.

03:01:04.700 --> 03:01:06.700
I don't I don't even know what he is a Republican.

03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:09.100
So you struggle with words.

03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:09.900
It seems to me.

03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:12.700
I think I think why is it becoming personal?

03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:15.300
He lied.

03:01:15.300 --> 03:01:18.600
He lied to people on fucking this guy's lying right now saying

03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:21.900
that they were not a Republican even though he's running as

03:01:21.900 --> 03:01:23.300
the Republican candidate.

03:01:23.300 --> 03:01:26.400
He was the Republican is Bernie Sanders a Democrat and in 20

03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:29.500
no, he's a registered Independent who caucuses with Democrats

03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:34.200
weird, so is Donald Trump is Donald Trump an independent

03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:38.900
or a Republican I would say Republican I would say he runs

03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:41.900
in the Republican hold on.

03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:46.100
Hey, hold on.

03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:46.500
Hold on.

03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:46.900
Hold on.

03:01:46.900 --> 03:01:50.000
He's doing Hassan pikers bullshit of arguing some tangents.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:54.100
Is this on pikers bullshit using like facts logic and definition.

03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:55.800
No, it's definitely not.

03:01:55.800 --> 03:01:56.500
It is definitely.

03:01:56.500 --> 03:02:01.400
Well, hold on like you guys guys can I jump in here?

03:02:01.900 --> 03:02:05.500
Let's have maybe be a be the the centrist that he was born

03:02:05.500 --> 03:02:06.200
with the centrist.

03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:11.400
Okay, I mean, it's very clear that Donald Trump is a part

03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:12.500
of the Republican Party.

03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:15.100
However, it's also very clear that he has no I'm sorry.

03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:18.400
He finished me finish you tell that I just want I just want

03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:20.300
I already missed that.

03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:24.600
However, it's also very clear that Donald Trump has no real

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:25.800
allegiance to it.

03:02:25.900 --> 03:02:28.000
And if it served his purposes, he would leave it.

03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:28.800
Correct.

03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:32.200
So so what are we probably what Artemis Fowl should have

03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:35.500
said is that Donald Trump is not conservative and he's not

03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:36.100
conservative.

03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:36.700
I would agree.

03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:41.000
But he is a Republican a Republican is part of a political

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:44.100
party. Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican.

03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:45.000
I understand.

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:48.100
This is Hassan Parker fucking thing to do in an argument

03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:48.800
Artemis Fowl.

03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:54.000
I'm going to tell you genius and you're an adult idiot.

03:02:54.900 --> 03:03:00.900
Okay, we're going to do this.

03:03:00.900 --> 03:03:01.800
We're going to do this.

03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:05.100
Both of you stop both of you stop.

03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:09.400
I mean, I would love to have this as an actual kind of back

03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:09.900
and forth.

03:03:10.100 --> 03:03:12.900
I don't think that now is the best time for it when we're

03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:17.900
closing down because we're about to get a whole lot of I need

03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:20.200
to say something because you told me I could after I waited

03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:20.700
for death.

03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:22.600
Well, okay, sure.

03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:23.100
Go ahead.

03:03:23.100 --> 03:03:24.900
But then I'm going to say as well.

03:03:24.900 --> 03:03:27.200
So there was a statement at the end of a stream about the

03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:30.300
Colorado Supreme Court decision and that it was brought by

03:03:30.300 --> 03:03:33.800
a nonpartisan organization and that was claimed here on the

03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:34.700
stream to you.

03:03:34.700 --> 03:03:35.700
What was the organization?

03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:39.500
It was Cruz something or responsibility and ethics in Washington.

03:03:39.500 --> 03:03:41.900
So I would watch dog.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:42.200
Yeah.

03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:42.400
Yeah.

03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:43.900
And there are they actually nonpartisan?

03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:48.600
No, they well, well, they they are actually they are led by

03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:49.900
a Bush-era Republican.

03:03:49.900 --> 03:03:52.400
He can he struggles with the word, but a Republican is not

03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:55.700
a Democrat and they go after Democratic corruption to there

03:03:55.700 --> 03:03:58.300
just happens to be more corruption on the Republican side

03:03:58.300 --> 03:04:02.600
and this was this was this was the the bot and Bailey site

03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:05.000
mountain Bailey, there we go.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:09.500
So after looking into it and looking at all of the receipts

03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:12.600
and everything for it media media matters actually owns

03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:15.600
crew. They actually have they they're in the same building

03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:18.400
ran by have multiple people that in the same organizations

03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:21.400
working in in different parts of each.

03:04:21.900 --> 03:04:23.500
It is it is.

03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:27.400
So it is not a nonpartisan organization.

03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:28.700
It is ran by media matters.

03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:30.200
It gets funded by Democratic.

03:04:30.900 --> 03:04:31.500
What do you call it?

03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:33.700
Donor dark money.

03:04:33.700 --> 03:04:36.000
Yeah, dark blue stuff.

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:36.400
Basically.

03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:36.700
Yes.

03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:37.700
Yes.

03:04:37.700 --> 03:04:39.300
So it's not a nonpartisan group.

03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:40.900
I don't know why people keep claiming that just because

03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:44.200
there's a Republican in it instead of just covers a Republican.

03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:44.900
What is the name of it again?

03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:46.000
I'm looking at real.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:46.500
What's the name of it?

03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:50.800
This is for responsibility and ethics in Washington.

03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:54.500
Okay, I had a big issue with this because I don't like

03:04:54.500 --> 03:04:59.100
when people try to couch obviously partisan hackery behind

03:04:59.100 --> 03:05:03.400
a veneer of non-partisanship that was my I understand

03:05:03.400 --> 03:05:05.800
I understand so he takes issue with the fact that it's

03:05:05.800 --> 03:05:08.500
led by a Republican and cases in question have been brought

03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:12.100
by Republican and independent voters, but because he's

03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:12.900
a MAGA cultist.

03:05:12.900 --> 03:05:14.000
He can't cope with that.

03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:16.700
Listen, it's all it's all partisan.

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:18.400
Well, then you never voted for trouble.

03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:22.000
Then you shouldn't have a problem reconciling this organization

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:25.800
is an organization goes after corruption including Democratic

03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:27.900
corruption. You see what they have to say about Senator

03:05:27.900 --> 03:05:30.600
Bob Menendez and elected Democratic senator.

03:05:31.100 --> 03:05:34.500
They're led by a Republican and if the cases in question

03:05:34.500 --> 03:05:37.300
are brought by Republican and independent voters, then

03:05:37.300 --> 03:05:41.600
it's probably fair to say it's nonpartisan just because

03:05:41.600 --> 03:05:42.800
it's against Trump.

03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:47.200
Maybe maybe there's actually a valid case against Trump.

03:05:47.200 --> 03:05:48.600
Now, we're going to hold on a second.

03:05:48.700 --> 03:05:53.800
We're going to look at that go go ahead the donors to crew

03:05:53.800 --> 03:05:57.400
include such groups as Democracy Alliance, which is a network

03:05:57.400 --> 03:06:00.800
of progressive mega donors service Employees International

03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:04.800
Union, which is a union in Canada the United States featuring

03:06:04.900 --> 03:06:08.300
service workers or representing service workers the ARCA Foundation

03:06:08.300 --> 03:06:12.000
which is a progressive American philanthropic Foundation

03:06:13.100 --> 03:06:17.000
and the Gill Foundation, which is an LGBT Foundation.

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:20.100
I mean, even if founded by a Republican it does seem to

03:06:20.100 --> 03:06:22.100
be funded primarily by left-leaning sources.

03:06:22.100 --> 03:06:24.500
It is it is not a nonpartisan organization.

03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:25.400
This is just a fuck.

03:06:25.400 --> 03:06:28.500
So what do you so what is nonpartisan?

03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:30.700
It is let's clear it up.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:31.500
Let's go ahead.

03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:36.700
It is a or is media matters a nonpartisan organization.

03:06:36.700 --> 03:06:38.000
What does nonpartisan me?

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:42.100
Hold on because maybe we have a lot of you what okay to

03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:42.900
rephrase the question.

03:06:42.900 --> 03:06:46.600
Can you give us an example Artemis of a nonpartisan organization

03:06:46.600 --> 03:06:47.300
in your opinion?

03:06:47.400 --> 03:06:48.300
What would you go?

03:06:48.800 --> 03:06:49.400
Jesus.

03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:50.200
Let's see.

03:06:52.300 --> 03:06:57.600
The DMV DMV is a government agency.

03:06:57.600 --> 03:07:02.000
What about a political organization clarify a political

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:03.000
organization?

03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:06.000
Fire would be one.

03:07:06.300 --> 03:07:07.400
I'll give them that one.

03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:09.800
I heard of that the fire.org.

03:07:09.800 --> 03:07:13.600
It's a free speech free speech organization Foundation of

03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:15.000
individual rights and expression.

03:07:15.900 --> 03:07:17.000
It takes.

03:07:17.100 --> 03:07:19.000
Oh, yes left right and center though.

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:22.000
A lot of people have accused them of being right-leaning

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:26.300
because some of their donors are from the right some of them.

03:07:26.300 --> 03:07:26.700
Okay.

03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:30.300
Do you have another one SPJ the Society of professional

03:07:30.300 --> 03:07:31.800
journalists would probably another one.

03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:33.500
All right.

03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:36.500
So here's my question if we go through this in real time.

03:07:36.500 --> 03:07:41.300
Can we find examples of allegations where or credible evidence

03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:45.200
where the nonpartisan groups that you list skew towards a

03:07:45.200 --> 03:07:49.700
particular political affiliation because here's my point.

03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:51.200
I want to be very clear about this.

03:07:51.500 --> 03:07:55.800
I do not mean to suggest that Cruz output is neutral in the

03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:59.600
sense that for every Republican complaint, they have a Democrat

03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:03.200
complaint want to be very clear about that it go after Republicans

03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:04.300
more than Democrats.

03:08:04.300 --> 03:08:07.300
The reason I call them nonpartisan is that they will go after

03:08:07.300 --> 03:08:10.200
Democrats when they think Democrats are guilty of corruption.

03:08:10.200 --> 03:08:12.200
Bob Menendez is a great example.

03:08:12.700 --> 03:08:15.000
I think you're struggling to deal with in my opinion.

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.800
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you have good examples to the contrary

03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:20.900
is that right now there tends to be more corruption within

03:08:20.900 --> 03:08:24.300
the Republican Party than there does the Democratic Party,

03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:27.900
which is why you don't see what do you have evidence for

03:08:27.900 --> 03:08:28.400
that claim?

03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:34.600
I can give you examples like so no evidence like numbers like

03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:36.100
I don't need fucking anecdotes.

03:08:36.100 --> 03:08:39.100
Why do you keep saying that you're you're giving me anecdotes

03:08:39.100 --> 03:08:40.700
when you talk about the partisanship?

03:08:40.700 --> 03:08:42.800
You're like, no, no, no, I don't think they're I don't think

03:08:42.800 --> 03:08:43.900
they're nonpartisan.

03:08:43.900 --> 03:08:48.000
They skew too much towards the left and then the examples

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:51.000
that some of the examples that you just provided apparently

03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:53.400
the perception is they skew to the right.

03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:57.600
I don't have hard data to how would how would I compute that?

03:08:57.800 --> 03:08:58.400
I'm confused.

03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:01.800
Well, first of all, I'm going to be a wick partisan jmac.

03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:04.900
Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships really appreciate

03:09:04.900 --> 03:09:09.100
you. Congratulations to all those who get those memberships

03:09:09.100 --> 03:09:10.900
anyway, I'm confused.

03:09:10.900 --> 03:09:16.200
Is it media matters the organization that try to get all

03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:21.400
of the was it the stuff pulled from X by intentionally fucking

03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:25.900
with the algorithm to put advertising next to Nazi tweets

03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:26.700
also?

03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:27.500
Hey jmac.

03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:30.100
What can you jmac is the answer is yes.

03:09:30.100 --> 03:09:33.600
I don't know who he is individually, but I know he comes

03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:37.900
around sometimes and says hi jmac is the Adam and sitch mega

03:09:37.900 --> 03:09:38.500
whale.

03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:42.000
Oh the mega whale the Adam and sitch mega whale won't look

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.200
throw some of that whale action my way buddy.

03:09:44.300 --> 03:09:45.100
Thank you for being here.

03:09:45.100 --> 03:09:47.500
Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships really appreciate

03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:49.100
you. Yeah, jmac.

03:09:49.100 --> 03:09:50.600
I was dreaming tomorrow.

03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:51.200
Join me.

03:09:51.200 --> 03:09:58.100
Jamie medium letters backs crew makes me partisan.

03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:00.900
Hmm.

03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:02.800
I would say no.

03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:06.200
I would say you won't let him answer let him answer like

03:10:06.200 --> 03:10:07.100
because you asked him a question.

03:10:08.100 --> 03:10:08.800
He asked.

03:10:08.900 --> 03:10:09.200
Okay.

03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:10.900
Well, you can ask the full thing, but I think you got the

03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:11.400
point across.

03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:14.400
He's asking if something is sponsored by something.

03:10:14.600 --> 03:10:16.800
Does that make it innately partisan?

03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:21.600
But the fact is is that media matters and crew both have

03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:25.700
multiple people from both that work in both companies and

03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:29.100
I'll put the lawyers are pushed the media matters lawyers

03:10:29.100 --> 03:10:30.500
are in the crew case.

03:10:31.300 --> 03:10:33.500
You can since you talked about evidence.

03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:34.700
Can you send me that link?

03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:37.100
Yeah, let me actually shit.

03:10:37.100 --> 03:10:37.300
Rick.

03:10:37.300 --> 03:10:38.400
Do you still have that?

03:10:39.300 --> 03:10:41.800
So I said to you ready 20 links dude.

03:10:41.800 --> 03:10:43.200
I probably do.

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:45.700
I could help probably there.

03:10:45.700 --> 03:10:46.800
I'd have to look for it.

03:10:46.800 --> 03:10:52.100
So so the socialist answer to this is that as long as money

03:10:52.100 --> 03:10:55.000
is changing hands, they're inherently corrupt and it's eternal

03:10:55.200 --> 03:10:59.200
and that's just how it is and that nothing everything is

03:10:59.200 --> 03:10:59.700
political.

03:10:59.700 --> 03:11:01.400
Nothing can truly be nonpartisan.

03:11:01.700 --> 03:11:04.200
And listen, I'm I'm fine.

03:11:04.300 --> 03:11:05.800
I'm fine with that.

03:11:05.800 --> 03:11:08.900
I'll if that's your definition of what a nonpartisan is.

03:11:08.900 --> 03:11:11.700
I'm fine with it's very strict, but I'm fine with the reason

03:11:11.700 --> 03:11:14.800
I said they're nonpartisan is because they will go after

03:11:14.800 --> 03:11:17.100
instances of Democratic corruption as well.

03:11:17.100 --> 03:11:20.300
I use Bob Menendez as a great recent example.

03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:22.100
That's why I said they're nonpartisan.

03:11:22.300 --> 03:11:26.800
I don't and I also like the concept of they get one off

03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:30.300
like one one Democrat for every thousand Republicans or

03:11:30.300 --> 03:11:32.800
whatever. That's that what is that what the ratio is?

03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:36.600
I have no idea but the like I've seen media matters do this.

03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:38.000
Wait, what is that?

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:38.800
What is the ratio?

03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:39.800
That's media matters.

03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:40.700
I'm five percent.

03:11:40.700 --> 03:11:43.000
I don't know the ratio be clear, but it's a ratio is like

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:46.700
big 55% of the people that get got by them are Republicans

03:11:46.700 --> 03:11:48.100
and 45% are Democrats.

03:11:48.100 --> 03:11:52.800
Does that is that close enough to suggest non-partisanship

03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:54.400
to you or is it too much?

03:11:54.700 --> 03:11:57.500
I think anything like 70 30 would be fine.

03:11:57.500 --> 03:12:02.400
Like I don't really yeah, so I don't have a breakdown of

03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:03.000
the cases.

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:06.200
I don't all I know is that yes, they go after Republicans

03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:08.800
more but they have gone after Democrats as well.

03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:12.000
They are or were led by a George W.

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:17.100
Bush former employee a bush-era Republican and our media

03:12:17.100 --> 03:12:19.400
matters. That's a different organization.

03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:21.700
If you want to make allegations about media matters,

03:12:21.700 --> 03:12:22.500
I'm fine with that.

03:12:22.500 --> 03:12:25.100
I'm not nearly as conversant on media matters and they're

03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:28.700
not party to the lawsuit as far as the lawsuits are concerned.

03:12:28.700 --> 03:12:31.400
The reason that I made a big deal about of this if I remember

03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:34.300
our first conversation is because the lawsuits are being

03:12:34.300 --> 03:12:36.700
brought by Republican and independent voters.

03:12:37.500 --> 03:12:43.100
I found something I found something as relevant.

03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:45.500
Okay, so right on the Wikipedia page.

03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:51.500
Basically from 2005 and 2014 their annual reports named

03:12:51.700 --> 03:12:57.300
25 corrupt Democrats and 63 corrupt Republicans, so that

03:12:57.300 --> 03:13:01.500
would be 28% Democratic and then whatever the other amount

03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:03.200
is. When did media matters by?

03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:04.700
I don't know.

03:13:04.700 --> 03:13:07.600
I see through you're going to find out that that number

03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:10.800
is going to add line up pretty quick, but to kind of interrogate

03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:11.400
you pondering.

03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:14.600
I said both of them too, by the way ting great and interrogate

03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:17.600
you pondering for the moment or under that definition of

03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:22.800
going after the other side and as an astute wick chatter

03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:27.300
pointed out would that make Fox News nonpartisan because

03:13:27.300 --> 03:13:30.100
they sometimes will go after Republicans as well.

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:36.500
I would say that Fox News has a liberal or excuse me a

03:13:36.500 --> 03:13:39.500
conservative bent, but this was my point when we go back

03:13:39.500 --> 03:13:45.100
to nonpartisan as I said probably 15 minutes ago if if Artemis

03:13:45.100 --> 03:13:54.500
wants to say that crew has a favorable is a favorable perception

03:13:54.500 --> 03:13:58.100
of Democrats because they criticize Democrats less often.

03:13:58.100 --> 03:13:59.200
I'm sympathetic to that.

03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:03.600
I just think that I that to me doesn't contradict nonpartisan

03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:07.600
unless you have an extremely strict view of what nonpartisan

03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:11.500
is which is for every complaint you have against a Democrat

03:14:11.700 --> 03:14:15.200
you have to bring one against a Republican and vice versa.

03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:20.600
I do not contest that crew spends more time going after Republicans

03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:23.400
than Democrats and never suggested otherwise.

03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:26.000
The reason I said that they were nonpartisan is because they're

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:29.600
an anti-corruption watchdog group that will persistently

03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:33.000
go after corruption even from Democrats.

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:36.200
They just don't go after Democrats as often I would argue

03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:39.300
that's a function of Republicans just being more corrupt.

03:14:42.900 --> 03:14:46.900
Yeah, I'm going to go with the it is obviously it's ran by

03:14:46.900 --> 03:14:47.700
media matters.

03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:51.700
It is looks like I can't find when they when they purchase

03:14:51.700 --> 03:14:52.000
it though.

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:53.600
I can't find that it's 2015.

03:14:54.200 --> 03:15:02.200
Yeah, there was a a article that came out saying look who

03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:05.500
now owns it or whatever the fuck or lined with it.

03:15:05.500 --> 03:15:07.100
I have to go find it again.

03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:09.200
Okay, that sounds good.

03:15:09.200 --> 03:15:09.900
I can find it.

03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:13.700
No again, I'm fine with that but it was Republicans and

03:15:13.700 --> 03:15:15.400
independents who brought the case.

03:15:15.400 --> 03:15:18.000
It's not just liberals bringing this case.

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.200
I don't know why you think that that means anything they

03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:22.200
found a fucking why wait.

03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:26.000
Why why do I think that it matters that no, no, it doesn't

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.000
matter what case we're even are you even arguing about the

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:32.600
Colorado the Colorado removal of Trump from the ballot?

03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:36.400
Yeah, so Artemis right Democrats in the left bringing this

03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:39.700
stuff against Trump and my position is it's a bit more nuanced

03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:42.600
than that because Republicans are the ones making the claims

03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:43.200
important.

03:15:43.500 --> 03:15:45.800
He says it doesn't matter because I got a crew is the one

03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:46.400
backing them.

03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:49.800
So I got a question for dev and wick.

03:15:50.300 --> 03:15:55.600
Okay, so so if you can if a single person cannot sue for

03:15:55.600 --> 03:15:59.000
fraud in the 2020 election individually as a voter, why

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.900
would they be able to sue in a primary to get somebody off

03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:02.600
the ballot?

03:16:03.700 --> 03:16:05.700
Because they would have no standing either way.

03:16:05.700 --> 03:16:07.600
It doesn't seem like they should be able to answer that

03:16:07.600 --> 03:16:09.100
question before you answer that question.

03:16:09.100 --> 03:16:10.900
I'm sorry, can because it sounds like we're going on to a

03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:11.500
different thing.

03:16:11.500 --> 03:16:13.800
No, no, no, I was just like that just came into my head and

03:16:13.800 --> 03:16:16.600
I was I wanted to get that out before I put there.

03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:20.000
I mean, yeah, what I recall is that in 2020 some of the

03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:22.100
lawsuits were thrown out for standing and the standing was

03:16:22.100 --> 03:16:25.900
you can't have a random Joe just sue because it's like,

03:16:25.900 --> 03:16:26.700
okay, that makes sense.

03:16:26.700 --> 03:16:28.700
And if it is equivalent, then I guess it would make sense

03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:29.200
here too.

03:16:29.300 --> 03:16:31.700
Yeah, and the the answer is you can literally find a random

03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:36.200
person as a as the front the front face to a lawsuit by a

03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:37.300
large corporation.

03:16:37.300 --> 03:16:40.100
That's why it doesn't matter who they find for this primary

03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:42.400
issue is because they could literally just pay anybody to

03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:42.800
do it.

03:16:43.700 --> 03:16:48.200
I think so, but the court decided to hear the case the

03:16:48.200 --> 03:16:52.800
correct which is the process of arguing it and writing out

03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:53.900
their opinion.

03:16:54.300 --> 03:16:57.300
What about the actual merits of the case?

03:16:57.500 --> 03:17:00.500
Are you do you say because I thought at the end of the day,

03:17:00.500 --> 03:17:01.300
this is the same problem.

03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:04.400
I had when people were talking about the plagiarism things

03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:08.100
like oh a Republican brought that so we have to ignore that

03:17:08.100 --> 03:17:10.400
and Republican brought that to the forefront.

03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:11.700
I don't give a shit.

03:17:11.900 --> 03:17:13.300
Are the allegations true?

03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:16.600
Does the case have merit or does it not?

03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:20.200
I don't care about the message at the end of the day.

03:17:20.900 --> 03:17:24.100
There's a mere ways with can we can we point out one thing

03:17:24.100 --> 03:17:26.500
so that the crux of the disagreement least the one that

03:17:26.500 --> 03:17:29.600
he brought to me in this conversation is he doesn't think

03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:30.500
it matters.

03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:35.600
It doesn't it basically this is not a this is still a scheme

03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:38.900
by the left and the Democrats Republicans play no role in

03:17:38.900 --> 03:17:42.600
this apparently no Republican challenges Donald Trump's

03:17:42.600 --> 03:17:45.900
eligibility under section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

03:17:45.900 --> 03:17:50.400
It is purely Democrats and the left because he says that

03:17:50.400 --> 03:17:53.100
the fact that Republicans are filing a suit doesn't matter

03:17:53.100 --> 03:17:57.000
when they've got a left-leaning nonprofit behind them.

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:58.600
Yeah, do you think it matters?

03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:00.500
Well, first of all first of all Artemis.

03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:03.000
Do you think that's a fair recounting of your position?

03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:08.400
It's sort of because I can't remember what state Supreme

03:18:08.400 --> 03:18:10.800
Court said it but they literally threw it out because

03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:13.600
of this because it was obviously a bid just to get somebody

03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:14.800
removed off the ballot.

03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:18.400
But that's what it was and I'm trying to figure out which

03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:21.000
state it said it in so I can use it is it Michigan?

03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:25.100
Yeah, Michigan said that because they pointed out that

03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:27.900
they are literally a partisan organization that pushed

03:18:27.900 --> 03:18:30.800
this specifically because that's why we have the Supreme

03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:33.900
Court to adjudicate and different court and that's where

03:18:33.900 --> 03:18:35.600
it's going to go and that's why it's going to get struck

03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:37.400
down because regardless of who took it up.

03:18:37.400 --> 03:18:39.800
They never should have it's going to get wiped out.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:44.000
So Wick my question to you is is it possible for Republicans

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.700
some Republicans in this country some conservatives in

03:18:46.700 --> 03:18:50.400
this country to genuinely believe that Trump is ineligible

03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:51.300
under the 14th.

03:18:51.300 --> 03:18:53.400
I I know them right.

03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:54.800
I know that that's the thing though.

03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:55.500
I do like it.

03:18:55.500 --> 03:18:58.900
The fact that both of you are asking me questions to snidely

03:18:58.900 --> 03:19:02.900
well apparently apparently this is what do you think about

03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:05.800
this and I'm going to frame my opponent's argument in the

03:19:05.800 --> 03:19:06.500
worst way possible.

03:19:06.500 --> 03:19:07.700
But no, I think it's fine.

03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:13.700
So Artemis is there so he believes that there are people

03:19:13.700 --> 03:19:16.700
in this country conservatives and Republicans who do genuinely

03:19:16.700 --> 03:19:20.100
believe Donald Trump is disqualified under the 14th Amendment,

03:19:20.100 --> 03:19:21.200
which is my position.

03:19:21.200 --> 03:19:22.400
Do you agree or disagree?

03:19:22.500 --> 03:19:24.200
I think there's probably people out there that do.

03:19:24.700 --> 03:19:27.800
Okay, and I don't see at this point what the beef is.

03:19:27.800 --> 03:19:31.100
I think that we have gotten as asymptotically close to consensus

03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:32.700
over who's behind this.

03:19:32.700 --> 03:19:36.100
I agree that certainly it would favor the Democrats this

03:19:36.100 --> 03:19:38.900
particular outcome over the Republican Party in general.

03:19:39.100 --> 03:19:43.300
My position is that these suits it does matter that Republican

03:19:43.300 --> 03:19:46.400
voters are bringing the suit that I that it's not we don't

03:19:46.400 --> 03:19:49.900
have no evidence that their feelings are insincere or that

03:19:49.900 --> 03:19:53.700
it's just some sort of elaborate scheme brew probably has

03:19:53.700 --> 03:19:54.800
motivated reasoning.

03:19:54.800 --> 03:19:56.700
They think Donald Trump is corrupt.

03:19:56.700 --> 03:19:59.300
They probably also think he is ineligible under the 14th

03:19:59.300 --> 03:20:02.400
Amendment and there are Republican and independent voters

03:20:02.400 --> 03:20:03.500
who feel likewise.

03:20:03.700 --> 03:20:04.700
I think that matters.

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.800
Let me hear let me let me give you a olive branch, right?

03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:12.600
If a organization that was without actually like actually

03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:16.600
nonpartisan and didn't really have any backing from a obviously

03:20:16.600 --> 03:20:20.600
partisan source brought this case and succeeded it would

03:20:20.600 --> 03:20:22.000
have a lot more way behind it.

03:20:22.600 --> 03:20:27.100
The problem is is that they chose a an organization that

03:20:27.100 --> 03:20:29.800
was backed by Media Matters because it's ran by Media Matters

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:33.600
the people from Media Matters in the organization is caused

03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:36.300
doubt to be produced in this court case.

03:20:36.600 --> 03:20:38.200
And that is the issue you're going to run.

03:20:38.200 --> 03:20:41.500
You're going to see this come into the Supreme Court case

03:20:41.500 --> 03:20:44.500
is that it's going to be pointed out but here the Artemis

03:20:44.700 --> 03:20:50.600
like I don't think I cannot think of a scenario where it

03:20:50.600 --> 03:20:54.400
wouldn't cause a sizable portion of the Republican Party

03:20:54.400 --> 03:20:57.400
to doubt the merits of it just simply based on the accusation.

03:20:57.500 --> 03:21:01.100
I cannot think of any organization that brought this forward

03:21:01.100 --> 03:21:02.800
like even if Liz Cheney, right?

03:21:02.800 --> 03:21:05.700
Remember when Liz Cheney and all those Republicans voted

03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:09.000
to impeach Trump and immediately they were decided all these

03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:10.000
are Republicans.

03:21:10.100 --> 03:21:14.500
So what if a person just hired an attorney from a regular

03:21:14.500 --> 03:21:16.900
like lawyer's office and then did this?

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:22.000
Yeah, I think that people would just be like like people

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:24.400
would find there's no there's no can well meet they would

03:21:24.400 --> 03:21:25.400
they would struggle.

03:21:25.900 --> 03:21:28.000
It would be wouldn't be nearly as easy.

03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:30.700
It'd be really fucking hard.

03:21:30.700 --> 03:21:31.700
I don't know if that's true.

03:21:31.900 --> 03:21:33.900
I'm not I'm not sure what you yeah, I'm not sure what you

03:21:33.900 --> 03:21:37.200
mean there out of curiosity since with brought up Liz Cheney

03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:42.300
Liz Cheney recently came out and admitted or confirmed.

03:21:42.600 --> 03:21:44.700
She thinks that Trump is disqualified under section 3

03:21:44.700 --> 03:21:45.700
of the 14th Amendment.

03:21:45.700 --> 03:21:46.300
Do you agree?

03:21:46.500 --> 03:21:49.600
Like do you think that she's a you think that her beliefs

03:21:49.600 --> 03:21:50.300
are sincere?

03:21:50.500 --> 03:21:51.800
No, well hold on.

03:21:51.900 --> 03:21:54.500
I believe that she sincerely hates the man and probably

03:21:54.600 --> 03:21:56.900
think so look she would believe it.

03:21:57.400 --> 03:21:58.700
I don't doubt her beliefs.

03:21:58.900 --> 03:22:00.600
I mean he shit all over her father.

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:02.400
She has every reason to hate him.

03:22:02.900 --> 03:22:05.000
So it would probably be colored in that way.

03:22:05.500 --> 03:22:07.600
You think it's possible that she let's say she hates him

03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:10.400
you think it's possible it's because of his actions not

03:22:10.400 --> 03:22:12.600
because he insulted her father.

03:22:14.800 --> 03:22:17.600
I there's no way to tell that that would be a mens rea

03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:20.600
thing and I will you just speculate it as to her men's

03:22:20.800 --> 03:22:22.700
rail. No, no, she definitely hates him.

03:22:23.600 --> 03:22:26.400
She she sacrificed her seat as a hold on.

03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:30.500
She sacrificed her seat as a congressperson to destroy him

03:22:30.500 --> 03:22:33.100
in the January 6th thing that she dedicated herself to

03:22:33.100 --> 03:22:36.200
that. She said I am going to destroy him off the get him

03:22:36.200 --> 03:22:36.800
off the ballot.

03:22:37.500 --> 03:22:40.300
You were willing to speculate that the reason was because

03:22:40.300 --> 03:22:42.600
he insulted Dick Cheney her father.

03:22:42.700 --> 03:22:45.500
So you were happy to speculate that that was the reason

03:22:45.500 --> 03:22:46.000
correct.

03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:50.300
I'm asking you is it possible that maybe let me try it

03:22:50.300 --> 03:22:51.800
conservative ahead.

03:22:51.800 --> 03:22:52.700
Let me try it this way.

03:22:53.600 --> 03:22:54.800
Someone joins the military.

03:22:55.400 --> 03:22:58.400
They go off to the foreign country and they fight the war

03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:01.700
and they kill a bunch of the enemy, right?

03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.800
Do they do that because they love their country and want

03:23:05.800 --> 03:23:08.700
to put their lives on the line and destroy its enemies or

03:23:08.700 --> 03:23:10.900
are they doing that because they hate those people and

03:23:10.900 --> 03:23:12.200
want to kill those people?

03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:16.100
I think it's I think it's slightly different reasoning

03:23:16.100 --> 03:23:19.900
because because Liz Cheney hated Trump before January 6th.

03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:21.200
No, she did not.

03:23:21.300 --> 03:23:23.300
She oh, she definitely fucking did.

03:23:23.300 --> 03:23:24.600
I don't know where she didn't.

03:23:25.200 --> 03:23:28.000
They are what do you think they are several indications

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:30.000
that she said you think it matters?

03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:31.100
Do you think it matters?

03:23:31.100 --> 03:23:32.100
Let me let me ask you this.

03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:38.200
How a congressperson Haves or how they vote.

03:23:38.200 --> 03:23:41.200
Do you think these are reflections of support or opposition?

03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:45.100
Vice can you say that again?

03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:49.200
Do you think how a congressperson any congressperson Democrat

03:23:49.200 --> 03:23:49.900
Republican?

03:23:49.900 --> 03:23:54.100
It doesn't matter how they behave who they support and

03:23:54.100 --> 03:23:55.000
how they vote.

03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:56.200
Do you think these things matter?

03:23:57.800 --> 03:24:04.200
Yes, for the most part you voted with Donald Trump 93% of

03:24:04.200 --> 03:24:07.500
the time higher than Jim Jordan higher than Mike Johnson.

03:24:07.900 --> 03:24:09.400
She put her money where her mouth was.

03:24:09.400 --> 03:24:11.000
She voted for him in 2016.

03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:14.200
She voted for him in 2020 and when she served in Congress

03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:18.600
while he was president 93 times out of a hundred she backed

03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:19.600
his legislation.

03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:23.000
It was one of the highest Republican ratings while Trump

03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:23.800
was in office.

03:24:24.200 --> 03:24:27.800
She was a dutiful soldier until January 6th.

03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:30.000
Well, I said hold on go ahead.

03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:33.700
Okay, so we have the voting part of that right you said

03:24:33.700 --> 03:24:36.400
there was two other things right how they conduct themselves

03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:39.700
and how they I can't what was the other one and how they

03:24:39.700 --> 03:24:41.800
vote how they vote how they conduct themselves who they

03:24:41.800 --> 03:24:46.200
support so so Liz Cheney did not support Donald Trump at

03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:49.400
all in terms of outside of voting, right?

03:24:49.700 --> 03:24:52.400
She's a definitely a log cabinet Republican.

03:24:52.800 --> 03:24:56.200
She she's made her statements clear that so outside of the

03:24:56.200 --> 03:24:58.400
one way of support that actually matters.

03:24:58.500 --> 03:24:59.300
She didn't okay.

03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:00.200
So, okay.

03:25:00.700 --> 03:25:03.900
Well, here's the issue right most of Trump's legislation

03:25:03.900 --> 03:25:05.700
wasn't created by Trump.

03:25:05.700 --> 03:25:08.400
It was created by other Republicans right was going to get

03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:09.300
the credit for it.

03:25:09.700 --> 03:25:14.200
I mean from I guess no, it's not it's listen.

03:25:14.600 --> 03:25:15.700
This is this is the beef.

03:25:15.700 --> 03:25:19.400
It's not an I guess when legislation passes under the

03:25:19.500 --> 03:25:21.600
it's the president who gets the credit.

03:25:21.700 --> 03:25:23.600
That's just how our politics works.

03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:26.000
Whether whether that's right or wrong and you could easily

03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:28.000
make the argument that once you get to the nuts and bolts

03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:30.200
as wrong, that's how it works.

03:25:30.600 --> 03:25:35.300
She backed Trump's legislation 93% of the time more than

03:25:35.300 --> 03:25:38.600
the vast majority of not just Congress, but even fellow

03:25:38.600 --> 03:25:43.000
Republicans she voted for him for president twice.

03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:47.400
What do you have prior to January 6th to indicate her strong

03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:51.900
opposition that would that is meaningfully counterweights

03:25:51.900 --> 03:25:53.500
what we just described.

03:25:53.800 --> 03:25:54.300
Okay.

03:25:55.500 --> 03:26:00.200
When did Trump call Dick Cheney?

03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:04.500
A loser or is it coward?

03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:12.000
Let's see.

03:26:12.100 --> 03:26:14.400
Was it now that seems way too.

03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:16.000
Are you sure you're not thinking of John McCain?

03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:17.100
Was it McCain?

03:26:17.200 --> 03:26:18.300
Trump called a lot of people.

03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:19.200
It was McCain.

03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:19.700
Not yet.

03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:20.700
It was John McCain.

03:26:20.700 --> 03:26:23.800
Not, you know, not Cheney, but but to be fair.

03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:28.200
It's an easy mistake to make as Trump has said a lot of bad

03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:29.200
shit about a lot.

03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:29.700
They're both.

03:26:29.700 --> 03:26:33.000
I think I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that he he also shit on

03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:33.500
like that.

03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:35.600
It's just possible.

03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:37.500
He might have he he should have a lot of people.

03:26:37.500 --> 03:26:38.000
Let's be honest.

03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:39.500
Yeah, he did.

03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:40.700
No, I'm pretty sure.

03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:41.000
Yeah.

03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:45.300
I think this is a mix-up because I know Megan McCain after

03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:47.100
her dad got shit on by Trump.

03:26:47.300 --> 03:26:50.000
She like immediately turned on Trump and she did so long

03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:52.200
before January 6th, right?

03:26:52.500 --> 03:26:53.600
Yeah, absolutely.

03:26:54.700 --> 03:26:56.900
That is not my recollection of Liz Cheney.

03:26:56.900 --> 03:27:00.100
Liz Cheney was a dutiful soldier with her with how she voted

03:27:00.100 --> 03:27:04.600
as a member of Congress in 2000 2016 to 2020 almost most

03:27:04.600 --> 03:27:08.500
definitely and again to the reason I brought it up is because

03:27:08.500 --> 03:27:12.900
her and the other Republicans were immediately cast out and

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:17.300
Immediately castigated as never Trumpers as all rhinos.

03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:21.200
She was the third in command of the House Republican Conference.

03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:23.900
She had a job that currently Elise Stefanik has.

03:27:25.600 --> 03:27:28.400
She was censured by the Republican Party as a result of

03:27:28.400 --> 03:27:30.900
her opposition to Trump post January 6th.

03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:33.500
So no, I listen.

03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:36.000
I'm not saying that that means you have to accept the merits.

03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:39.200
It's entirely possible that there is a relatively bipartisan

03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:42.000
coalition of anti Trumpers and that doesn't mean you're obligated

03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:43.500
Believe that they're right.

03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:47.200
I'm just telling you it is a fact and it is a fact that

03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:48.500
it's not just Democrats.

03:27:48.700 --> 03:27:52.500
It is mostly Democrats, but there is a sizable portion of

03:27:52.500 --> 03:27:56.800
lifelong conservatives and former Republican officials who

03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:01.600
despise the man and for legitimate reasons, not just because

03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:04.600
he insulted their dads last word Artemis and I'd like to

03:28:04.600 --> 03:28:07.700
have this in a more long form, but I know that actually

03:28:07.700 --> 03:28:10.800
yeah, cuz I wanted to talk about the January 6th committee.

03:28:10.800 --> 03:28:15.100
Yeah, so Artemis and I you and I've been I've been talking

03:28:15.100 --> 03:28:16.900
for like a week now with the January 6th committee.

03:28:16.900 --> 03:28:20.200
And yeah, yeah, they've been some fun conversation.

03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:20.600
How about this?

03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:23.700
How about this next week next week?

03:28:23.700 --> 03:28:25.800
I have I'm putting my schedule together.

03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:28.700
You guys tell me when you can make it and I'll say some time

03:28:28.700 --> 03:28:30.000
and we can do the January 6th.

03:28:30.600 --> 03:28:32.700
I am procrastinating right now.

03:28:32.700 --> 03:28:34.800
Like you wouldn't believe we're all here.

03:28:34.800 --> 03:28:36.800
Let's just chat for like half an hour.

03:28:36.800 --> 03:28:37.800
Let's just like listen.

03:28:37.800 --> 03:28:39.100
Yeah, I got hungry.

03:28:39.100 --> 03:28:42.300
I got whoever is under you don't have to do you just be

03:28:42.300 --> 03:28:44.100
here. Hold on.

03:28:44.100 --> 03:28:44.300
Hold on.

03:28:44.300 --> 03:28:47.000
I've got it here.

03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.200
We can TLDR really quick.

03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:52.200
So basically Artemis you and I were arguing you are just

03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:54.000
let me know if I'm if I'm mischaracterizing you.

03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:58.900
Okay, you think the January 6th committee is not valid for

03:28:58.900 --> 03:29:01.700
two reasons as far as I understand, right?

03:29:01.900 --> 03:29:04.900
And one reason is because it was it was based.

03:29:04.900 --> 03:29:07.000
Well, first of all, one reason is because evidence from it

03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:11.600
was destroyed and the second reason is because there were

03:29:11.600 --> 03:29:14.900
no Republicans on the committee or they were there like Rhinos

03:29:14.900 --> 03:29:17.800
on the committee and not actually McCarthy's five picks,

03:29:17.800 --> 03:29:18.100
right?

03:29:18.100 --> 03:29:19.100
Was it those two reasons?

03:29:19.100 --> 03:29:21.900
I would actually say that Liz Cheney and the other guy were

03:29:21.900 --> 03:29:24.600
probably more Republican than the actual Republican Party

03:29:24.600 --> 03:29:25.100
is now.

03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:26.000
Okay.

03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:30.500
The issue is you can't call Liz Cheney a rhino because

03:29:30.500 --> 03:29:33.500
Republicans were stood for blood and mine oil.

03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:35.200
Like okay, no fair enough.

03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:37.300
They would go to fuck up every other country.

03:29:37.300 --> 03:29:38.200
There was here.

03:29:38.500 --> 03:29:41.600
I'll rephrase there were no like Pro Trump positions on

03:29:41.600 --> 03:29:42.100
the panel.

03:29:42.100 --> 03:29:43.500
No populist types.

03:29:43.500 --> 03:29:43.900
Yeah.

03:29:44.100 --> 03:29:48.400
Yeah, and so therefore because Jim Jordan who's the most

03:29:48.400 --> 03:29:53.400
notorious for I'm gonna get drink keep talking cross-examining

03:29:53.400 --> 03:29:57.100
witnesses was not allowed on there is one of the biggest

03:29:57.100 --> 03:30:00.200
things and so when you and I argued about this I said well,

03:30:00.200 --> 03:30:03.300
it was because Jim Jordan was one of the guys being investigated

03:30:03.300 --> 03:30:03.900
by the panel.

03:30:03.900 --> 03:30:06.400
So it would be inappropriate for him to sit on the panel

03:30:06.400 --> 03:30:08.400
investigating the event when he was part of the event.

03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:13.200
Yeah, and I and I criticized that because the the the the

03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:17.600
panel the J6 Commission didn't exist to do to state that

03:30:17.600 --> 03:30:20.000
they're investigating in before that decision was made.

03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:23.300
So yeah, so it was yeah, so so so your view from what I

03:30:23.300 --> 03:30:25.400
understand is that it's that that's post hoc reasoning.

03:30:25.400 --> 03:30:28.700
It's like how did we know that Jim Jordan was involved in

03:30:28.700 --> 03:30:31.200
the situation before the panel was put together?

03:30:31.200 --> 03:30:35.100
So when Nancy Pelosi rejects Jim Jordan as a pick, how

03:30:35.100 --> 03:30:37.500
did she know that he was inappropriate to sit on the panel

03:30:37.500 --> 03:30:39.700
because the panel hadn't discovered anything yet because

03:30:39.700 --> 03:30:42.200
there's no evidence of her reasoning.

03:30:42.200 --> 03:30:44.200
I mean if she if she had it she should have posted at

03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:48.900
the time right and my view on that is basically that Nancy

03:30:48.900 --> 03:30:52.900
Pelosi is this cutthroat lifelong politician who probably

03:30:52.900 --> 03:30:56.500
has her finger in every single pie in Washington DC and

03:30:56.500 --> 03:30:59.900
there is no way she didn't know beforehand that Jim Jordan's

03:30:59.900 --> 03:31:01.400
name was going to come up in this committee.

03:31:02.100 --> 03:31:04.800
Well, I believe if because you got to remember that there

03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:08.400
was evidence and you know, just due to the the reporting

03:31:08.400 --> 03:31:09.100
of the event.

03:31:09.100 --> 03:31:13.300
I'd have to go back to the timeline but there were I'm almost

03:31:13.300 --> 03:31:17.500
certain allegations of Jim Jordan's impropriety with respect

03:31:17.500 --> 03:31:20.200
to Trump's schemes to overthrow the election prior to the

03:31:20.200 --> 03:31:24.200
formation of the January 6 select committee me and if unless

03:31:24.200 --> 03:31:28.100
I'm wrong it's possible, but I doubt it that means that

03:31:28.100 --> 03:31:31.100
she had a sufficient predicate to think that Jim Jordan

03:31:31.100 --> 03:31:35.900
may be materially relevant to the the scope of the investigation.

03:31:35.900 --> 03:31:37.700
I think that's a fair assumption to me.

03:31:37.700 --> 03:31:40.500
So here's the thing if that's true though because Artemis

03:31:40.500 --> 03:31:42.100
and I went through this if that's true.

03:31:42.100 --> 03:31:44.500
She didn't say it at all because we went searching for

03:31:44.500 --> 03:31:47.900
like what did Nancy Pelosi say before the January 6 or

03:31:47.900 --> 03:31:50.900
he was formed we went looking and the only thing she said

03:31:50.900 --> 03:31:54.100
is she just said I think he's inappropriate his actions

03:31:54.100 --> 03:31:54.700
in his comments.

03:31:54.700 --> 03:31:57.700
She was very vague about it and I can only point to the

03:31:57.700 --> 03:32:00.900
Fox News nighttime things where he was on there talking

03:32:00.900 --> 03:32:04.900
about it about the what he said to the president and that

03:32:04.900 --> 03:32:05.200
was it.

03:32:05.200 --> 03:32:06.200
Right, right.

03:32:06.200 --> 03:32:08.900
And I think that's some of the the evidence I'm thinking

03:32:08.900 --> 03:32:11.300
of because I remember people asking him and there were a

03:32:11.300 --> 03:32:13.600
couple of awkward interviews like did you hey, did you ever

03:32:13.600 --> 03:32:17.700
talk to Donald Trump on January 6 and he's like why me?

03:32:17.700 --> 03:32:19.800
I talked I talked to the president all the time.

03:32:19.800 --> 03:32:21.200
It's a great moment.

03:32:21.200 --> 03:32:22.000
I saw that.

03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:25.600
Yeah, the big issue is is that oh, no, go ahead.

03:32:25.600 --> 03:32:25.900
Sorry.

03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:28.900
No, I was just gonna say and by the way Artemis kidding

03:32:28.900 --> 03:32:31.100
aside and this is why I didn't have a problem with this

03:32:31.100 --> 03:32:34.000
earlier. I like throwing elbows and we can tell you that

03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:34.500
was fun.

03:32:34.500 --> 03:32:37.800
I love yeah, I love going off on lactoid and back and forth.

03:32:37.800 --> 03:32:42.600
Yeah, so so I don't I don't I miss the Bloodsport days when

03:32:42.600 --> 03:32:46.600
I was actually known on the internet right now.

03:32:46.600 --> 03:32:49.900
You're known for being an Irish teen genius who so yeah,

03:32:49.900 --> 03:32:51.800
yeah, it was a horrible movie.

03:32:51.800 --> 03:32:54.500
Oh, but without revealing this without revealing the secret

03:32:54.500 --> 03:32:57.000
Artemis had a different name black back in the Bloodsport

03:32:57.000 --> 03:32:59.700
days and he had a name for himself back then which he abandoned

03:32:59.700 --> 03:33:00.700
a large man.

03:33:01.100 --> 03:33:01.700
Oh God.

03:33:01.700 --> 03:33:02.100
Okay.

03:33:02.100 --> 03:33:02.400
All right.

03:33:02.400 --> 03:33:04.400
Well, I do not want to know.

03:33:04.400 --> 03:33:05.600
I'm just popping off.

03:33:05.700 --> 03:33:07.300
I'm just good reason YouTube.

03:33:07.300 --> 03:33:08.100
I don't want to know.

03:33:10.500 --> 03:33:10.800
Go ahead.

03:33:10.800 --> 03:33:11.500
Go keep going.

03:33:11.500 --> 03:33:13.800
I was just gonna say I was just gonna say so in conclusion

03:33:14.300 --> 03:33:19.000
I would offer as a as a counter proposition to to to your

03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:23.600
point that that Pelosi never gave reason explicitly maybe

03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:26.200
she felt it would have been inappropriate to kind of like

03:33:26.200 --> 03:33:29.400
precast Jim Jordan's going to be under investigation.

03:33:29.900 --> 03:33:32.100
I'm not saying that that's the right way to handle it.

03:33:32.100 --> 03:33:34.000
But that I that makes sense to me.

03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:37.900
So so do you know Eric Swalwell is do okay.

03:33:37.900 --> 03:33:41.600
Do you remember what the big what the big committees he

03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:46.000
was on? I believe it was oversight and Judiciary wasn't

03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:49.200
it? I thought it was like intelligence right as well House

03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:50.900
and tell there is a House Intelligence Committee.

03:33:50.900 --> 03:33:54.600
Yeah, and he was on there in his his his fling with a suspected

03:33:54.600 --> 03:33:55.400
Chinese pie.

03:33:55.700 --> 03:33:55.900
Yeah.

03:33:55.900 --> 03:33:59.400
So when they didn't remove him from an obvious relationship

03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:05.900
with a spy Chinese by that never like that that was confirmed

03:34:05.900 --> 03:34:08.400
a relationship at a for a period of time doesn't really

03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:11.800
matter how long or like they didn't get into what they discussed

03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:14.800
at all, but that in and of itself they never removed him

03:34:14.800 --> 03:34:17.200
from that committee at all during that period of time.

03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:22.300
So I would I would want to go back and fact-check the details

03:34:22.300 --> 03:34:25.100
of that because number one, I don't know if it was ever confirmed

03:34:25.100 --> 03:34:29.700
that she was a spy number two the extent and the timeline

03:34:29.700 --> 03:34:34.000
of the involvement probably does matter but note that they

03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:38.400
didn't kick they didn't kick Jim Jordan out of the House

03:34:38.400 --> 03:34:40.900
Judiciary Committee or how to vet of anything else.

03:34:40.900 --> 03:34:44.300
They just said that he couldn't be on this specific subcommittee

03:34:44.300 --> 03:34:47.800
and I do think that's different than kicking somebody off

03:34:47.800 --> 03:34:50.200
a committee on which they already are.

03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:51.200
I do think that's different.

03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:54.900
I don't know if Peng Feng or Christina Feng or whatever

03:34:54.900 --> 03:34:58.800
her name is was ever confirmed 100% but almost by the way,

03:34:58.800 --> 03:34:59.500
I just want to clarify.

03:34:59.500 --> 03:35:01.900
I don't think I do think that that merits investigation.

03:35:01.900 --> 03:35:03.900
I'm not saying that that means that that you give them a

03:35:03.900 --> 03:35:04.700
blank check.

03:35:04.700 --> 03:35:07.200
So normally what happens in an investigation?

03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:11.500
I have a top secret clearance secure compartmentalized

03:35:11.500 --> 03:35:15.000
information one whenever you're on investigation for security

03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:18.300
issues, you lose your clearance temporarily and you're

03:35:18.300 --> 03:35:22.800
removed from any jobs related to that until the investigation

03:35:22.800 --> 03:35:25.000
is over that is a normal process.

03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:30.200
So when they didn't do that and he sits on classified boards

03:35:30.200 --> 03:35:32.600
and briefings still during that period of time.

03:35:32.600 --> 03:35:36.200
He wasn't removed until the Republicans took over and he

03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:37.400
was denied his seat again.

03:35:38.400 --> 03:35:41.600
So right, so he was yes, he was removed from the committee

03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:44.100
once the majority change hands a couple of things.

03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:46.700
I'll say again because because you have me at a disadvantage

03:35:46.700 --> 03:35:49.100
here in the sense that I'm not intimately familiar with the

03:35:49.100 --> 03:35:52.200
story except the broad strokes number one.

03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:56.300
I don't think the house has anything to do with top secret

03:35:56.300 --> 03:35:58.000
clearance in the sense that I don't think they're the ones

03:35:58.000 --> 03:35:58.500
who give it.

03:35:58.500 --> 03:35:59.100
I think that's all.

03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:00.100
No, no, they receive it.

03:36:00.700 --> 03:36:01.000
Right.

03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:03.600
That's on there that he would be executive.

03:36:03.900 --> 03:36:05.100
Yeah, I'm the executive branch.

03:36:05.100 --> 03:36:06.200
So I agree.

03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:09.100
What I'm saying is that's not Pelosi's call to make that

03:36:09.100 --> 03:36:12.200
would have been that would have been the relevant executive

03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:13.100
branch agency.

03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:16.600
I think actually would be well losing these clearance would

03:36:16.600 --> 03:36:20.200
be an executive right, but removing it from that community

03:36:20.200 --> 03:36:21.400
would be her decision.

03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:22.900
That would have been her call.

03:36:22.900 --> 03:36:23.500
Yes.

03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:28.000
So what I'm saying is I would need to know more about what

03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:30.700
steps if any were taken and what the rationale was but I

03:36:30.700 --> 03:36:33.900
could conceive of a situation where it's like listen, she's

03:36:33.900 --> 03:36:35.000
a suspected spy.

03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:38.000
It doesn't look good, but we have no real evidence to suggest

03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:40.800
that you had engaged in any acts of impropriety.

03:36:40.800 --> 03:36:43.700
So we're not going to remove you from a committee on which

03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:46.200
you already are in contrast.

03:36:46.600 --> 03:36:48.600
Pelosi could have been saying based on reports.

03:36:48.600 --> 03:36:53.100
We do have some evidence to indicate that Jim Jordan was

03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:56.700
involved in whatever Trump was up to up to legal or illegal

03:36:56.700 --> 03:36:58.500
whatever but the subject of the investment.

03:36:58.500 --> 03:37:02.300
Let me put you like this reason Eric Swalwell if there was

03:37:02.300 --> 03:37:06.700
an investigation into Eric Swalwell's mistress, Eric Swalwell

03:37:06.700 --> 03:37:08.000
should not be on that committee.

03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:09.600
If he's on the committee, he should be removed.

03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:11.500
If he wasn't on it in the first place, he should never be

03:37:11.500 --> 03:37:12.100
put on it.

03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:15.800
That's what I think more comparable what happened with Jim

03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:20.100
Jordan. In this case, Jim Jordan's Chinese mistress was Donald

03:37:20.100 --> 03:37:25.000
Trump. And so I think the issue would go to okay.

03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:30.200
Well, I look at the details if you want them.

03:37:30.900 --> 03:37:38.200
So so basically Christine Fang she had been since 2012 cultivating

03:37:38.200 --> 03:37:42.300
contacts with politicians in California that the Chinese

03:37:42.300 --> 03:37:46.200
government had had believed would one.

03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:46.600
Yeah.

03:37:46.900 --> 03:37:50.000
Well, so they independently found something from the Chinese

03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:52.400
government saying that China taken took an interest in a

03:37:52.400 --> 03:37:57.100
list of Californian politicians and swallow was on the list.

03:37:57.100 --> 03:38:00.100
And then this woman Christine Fang shows up and starts getting

03:38:00.100 --> 03:38:02.400
heavily involved out of nowhere starts getting heavily involved

03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:03.300
in his campaign.

03:38:03.500 --> 03:38:06.600
She was also cultivating contacts with everyone else on that

03:38:06.600 --> 03:38:09.500
list. So they didn't really they didn't get her on being a

03:38:09.500 --> 03:38:12.200
spy, but she was doing all the things that a spy would do

03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:14.100
based on the document they got from the Chinese.

03:38:14.100 --> 03:38:17.500
She also fled to an embassy and then got you know, which

03:38:17.500 --> 03:38:18.200
yeah then left.

03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:19.200
Yeah, the return of China.

03:38:19.200 --> 03:38:21.500
Yeah, so probably probably a spy probably a spy.

03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:27.000
So what happened was she participated in his campaign in

03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:33.900
2014, but in 2015 US intelligence briefed him about

03:38:33.900 --> 03:38:37.400
possible spies and then Swalwell said oh shit.

03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:41.200
She's probably a spy and then cut contact with her and it

03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:45.500
turns out that Fang didn't even get any documents or any

03:38:45.500 --> 03:38:48.800
information from him during that time that that because

03:38:48.800 --> 03:38:51.500
here's the thing she was involved in his campaign, but

03:38:51.500 --> 03:38:54.200
she was not involved with him after he got elected and

03:38:54.200 --> 03:38:56.700
no information was leaked to her during during their

03:38:56.800 --> 03:38:59.800
hold and I thought the story was I thought he'd been sleeping

03:38:59.800 --> 03:39:01.500
with this Chinese chick who is taking.

03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:04.500
I thought he might have been well, here's the thing they

03:39:04.500 --> 03:39:05.400
discovered it.

03:39:05.700 --> 03:39:07.100
Well, maybe he slept with her.

03:39:07.700 --> 03:39:10.900
Well, they discovered they discovered that she had been

03:39:10.900 --> 03:39:13.500
sleeping with at least two of her other contacts that she

03:39:13.500 --> 03:39:16.500
had developed but not necessarily him.

03:39:16.800 --> 03:39:20.200
So so if you wait, hold on Artemis, you said he admitted

03:39:20.200 --> 03:39:20.900
to sleeping with her.

03:39:20.900 --> 03:39:21.900
Is that true or not?

03:39:22.300 --> 03:39:24.500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's true that he said that because

03:39:25.500 --> 03:39:30.700
we can find that cats it has sexual relationships with two

03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:34.100
unidentified Miss Midwestern mayors, but not with Swalwell

03:39:34.600 --> 03:39:36.000
though allegations persisted.

03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:38.200
He was a national security threat by being associated with

03:39:38.200 --> 03:39:44.000
her. So I think it's because I think it's because they did

03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:46.000
investigate him and they discovered that nothing was actually

03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:46.400
leaked.

03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:50.100
So they just kind of let it be but I'm sure if they discovered

03:39:50.100 --> 03:39:51.900
oh, he's actually compromised.

03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:53.800
They probably would have taken him off that committee and

03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:54.500
rightfully so.

03:39:54.500 --> 03:39:58.400
Yeah, cuz here it says that Saul refuses to say if he had

03:39:58.400 --> 03:40:01.900
sex with Fang Fang claiming it's a matter of national security

03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:04.000
not that he could share any details of their relationship.

03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:06.800
No, the fact that her name is Fang Fang is like a James Bond

03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:07.300
movie, dude.

03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:07.800
It's great.

03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:10.800
Well, they say they say Fang is one.

03:40:10.900 --> 03:40:12.600
You guys remember I'm going to make a racist joke.

03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:16.500
You guys remember the this isn't even a joke.

03:40:16.500 --> 03:40:17.200
This is a true story.

03:40:17.900 --> 03:40:22.900
The Chinese jet who rammed an American spy plane back in

03:40:22.900 --> 03:40:26.600
1999 2000 that kind of air vaguely vaguely recall this.

03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:28.500
I think yeah, the pilot's name.

03:40:28.500 --> 03:40:28.900
I shit.

03:40:28.900 --> 03:40:31.100
You not was a long way.

03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:38.700
So let me ask you Artemis because I'm doing some last minute

03:40:38.700 --> 03:40:39.700
Google food here.

03:40:39.700 --> 03:40:40.200
Go for it.

03:40:40.900 --> 03:40:42.500
And that was also not a racist joke.

03:40:42.500 --> 03:40:45.600
That was just a come through reference to just just make

03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:46.300
the racist jokes.

03:40:46.300 --> 03:40:46.900
It's okay.

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:48.200
No, no listening.

03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:49.400
I'm popped again.

03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:52.600
I can't I will not compromise my trajectory with that

03:40:52.600 --> 03:40:54.200
shenaniganry true.

03:40:54.400 --> 03:41:04.800
So does it does it matter to you that so according to Wikipedia

03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:11.300
Destiny's favorite source on in May late like mid-may 2019

03:41:11.300 --> 03:41:13.400
or excuse me, May 19th 2021.

03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:16.200
That was when they decided to drop it, right?

03:41:16.800 --> 03:41:19.700
No, that was when they decided to form the house January 6

03:41:19.700 --> 03:41:20.400
select committee.

03:41:20.500 --> 03:41:26.000
Yeah about May 19th 2021 the matter to you that in March

03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:32.800
2021 Kevin McCarthy went he tried to remove Eric Swalwell

03:41:33.200 --> 03:41:36.800
the House Intelligence Committee by passing a resolution.

03:41:37.400 --> 03:41:42.100
So for context he they tried to move to remove Eric Swalwell

03:41:42.100 --> 03:41:46.300
from that committee two months before the committee the

03:41:46.300 --> 03:41:49.000
separate committee the the house January 6 select committee

03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:54.000
was launched from which Jim Jordan was rejected.

03:41:54.000 --> 03:41:57.000
So actually it was Kevin McCarthy who made the first attempt

03:41:57.000 --> 03:41:57.500
to move.

03:41:58.000 --> 03:42:02.500
So the the statement by McCarthy was because a person that

03:42:02.500 --> 03:42:08.400
had relations with a quote-unquote spy a clear issue with

03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:13.400
having holding a class AA clearance on the House Intelligence

03:42:13.400 --> 03:42:19.900
Committee that is the the stuff there as a as a leap of logic

03:42:19.900 --> 03:42:21.400
is almost non-existent.

03:42:21.400 --> 03:42:23.900
You could just you could easily see why somebody would have

03:42:23.900 --> 03:42:26.700
an issue with somebody being on the committee, right, but

03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:28.800
I would argue the same I would argue.

03:42:28.800 --> 03:42:32.700
I don't know where where it measures but I think that you

03:42:32.700 --> 03:42:35.900
could easily make the case for Jim Jordan given what we knew

03:42:35.900 --> 03:42:39.400
about Jim Jordan's relationship with Trump and on the events

03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:41.400
leading up to January 6th at the time.

03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:44.100
Yeah, I think you could easily make the same justification

03:42:44.100 --> 03:42:47.400
that listen this guy might fall under the scope of the investigation

03:42:47.400 --> 03:42:51.300
maybe not but either way we can't we need to not give him

03:42:51.300 --> 03:42:55.200
a position to influence the investigation and they and they

03:42:55.200 --> 03:42:58.500
did it after and they did it after McCarthy tried to remove

03:42:58.500 --> 03:42:59.100
Swalwell.

03:42:59.100 --> 03:43:00.100
I think that matters.

03:43:00.300 --> 03:43:02.600
I well there was a recommend.

03:43:02.600 --> 03:43:03.300
Hey, I'm sorry.

03:43:03.300 --> 03:43:05.300
My camera just kicked off.

03:43:05.300 --> 03:43:06.600
So I'll just be on audio.

03:43:06.800 --> 03:43:10.700
Okay, I've been using my I would say two things one that

03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:18.500
was a request that didn't go anywhere which we know of as

03:43:18.500 --> 03:43:19.700
for the J6 things.

03:43:19.700 --> 03:43:25.700
I'm gonna make a two different arguments one is a knowledge

03:43:25.700 --> 03:43:26.600
based argument.

03:43:28.300 --> 03:43:33.700
If you have reason to suspect that somebody is going to be

03:43:33.700 --> 03:43:37.500
implicated in a investigation for the quote-unquote overthrow

03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:39.200
attempted overthrow of the United States.

03:43:39.700 --> 03:43:41.600
You might want to put that out into the public that way

03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:44.600
they can understand your decision-making at least some of

03:43:44.600 --> 03:43:47.700
the evidence there because we didn't you're going to get

03:43:47.700 --> 03:43:50.900
maligned with accusations of bias.

03:43:51.400 --> 03:43:56.200
The second thing is a pragmatic argument of if you didn't

03:43:56.200 --> 03:43:59.200
have this evidence to throw out there, but you had you know

03:43:59.200 --> 03:44:03.800
suspicions for the sake of looking a nonpartisan in a neutral

03:44:03.800 --> 03:44:08.400
RI body trying to do fact-find you don't get rid of the top

03:44:08.400 --> 03:44:09.400
Republicans.

03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:14.000
That everybody likes out of the Commission and deny them

03:44:14.500 --> 03:44:17.200
because you're going to get an issue where we have it now

03:44:17.200 --> 03:44:21.500
where the J6 is nothing but considered evil Satan on the

03:44:21.500 --> 03:44:26.100
right and the average population or the average citizen

03:44:26.100 --> 03:44:27.900
of the United States doesn't actually give a shit about

03:44:27.900 --> 03:44:28.600
what it found.

03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:31.400
So a couple of things number one.

03:44:31.500 --> 03:44:35.300
It wasn't a request Kevin McCarthy made a formal resolution

03:44:35.300 --> 03:44:38.900
to remove Swalwell from House Intelligence Committee.

03:44:38.900 --> 03:44:39.700
It wasn't a request.

03:44:39.700 --> 03:44:41.400
He tried to get it done by force.

03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:43.100
He just didn't have the votes number one, right?

03:44:43.100 --> 03:44:45.100
So it was a when I say request.

03:44:45.100 --> 03:44:48.800
I mean like he proffered to do it and he tried to do it

03:44:48.800 --> 03:44:50.500
and if he had his way it would have been done.

03:44:50.500 --> 03:44:52.700
He just didn't have the support for it number one and he

03:44:52.700 --> 03:44:56.300
get attempted at first and it was also a committee on which

03:44:56.300 --> 03:45:01.100
Swalwell was currently seated number one number two, I would

03:45:01.100 --> 03:45:04.500
argue that you wouldn't put that information out in the in

03:45:04.500 --> 03:45:08.700
the public prematurely, even if it casts a pall on the investigation

03:45:08.700 --> 03:45:11.200
like why aren't you seating Jim Jordan?

03:45:11.900 --> 03:45:15.200
I agree that there's probably no satisfying way to do it

03:45:15.200 --> 03:45:19.000
because if what if what you recommended was done and it

03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:21.200
could be seen as prejudicing the investigation.

03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:22.200
Okay, what's your evidence?

03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:24.400
Well, we're not prepared to produce it yet because the committee

03:45:24.400 --> 03:45:26.900
hasn't gotten started and by the way, we don't know where

03:45:26.900 --> 03:45:27.400
it's going.

03:45:27.400 --> 03:45:31.100
So the last thing we want to do is preemptively make act

03:45:31.100 --> 03:45:33.400
against a sitting member of Congress.

03:45:33.400 --> 03:45:35.700
I think you could easily make the argument that that was

03:45:35.700 --> 03:45:39.700
the responsible thing to do and number number three, which

03:45:39.700 --> 03:45:46.700
is the second point on this last part is the reason that

03:45:46.700 --> 03:45:51.900
the committee ended up being so skewed is because Kevin McCarthy

03:45:51.900 --> 03:45:54.500
Nancy Pelosi who did not have to do this.

03:45:54.800 --> 03:45:57.600
He could have played hardball and said I'm the speaker Kevin

03:45:57.600 --> 03:45:59.100
McCarthy. You're my bitch.

03:45:59.100 --> 03:46:02.500
I'll just do whatever I want said is a gesture of good faith.

03:46:02.500 --> 03:46:04.600
She said listen, let's do it 9-11 style.

03:46:05.500 --> 03:46:07.100
I'll pick five Democrats.

03:46:07.100 --> 03:46:10.900
You pick five Republicans will get equal subpoena power equal

03:46:10.900 --> 03:46:12.400
time yada yada yada.

03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:21.500
McCarthy offered five nominees and Nancy Pelosi shot down

03:46:21.500 --> 03:46:25.100
two who were seen as potential witnesses or potential

03:46:25.900 --> 03:46:28.200
potentially involved in the situation.

03:46:28.200 --> 03:46:30.200
So she said listen those other three fine.

03:46:30.200 --> 03:46:32.200
These two can't do it.

03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:35.700
So can you pick some others and Kevin McCarthy said no it's

03:46:35.700 --> 03:46:38.900
either my five the five that I named or none at all.

03:46:39.100 --> 03:46:45.800
Yep, that's McCarthy's decision me because if you keep going

03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:46.800
and I'll respond.

03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:49.100
That's why I can say Kevin Kevin McCarthy.

03:46:49.100 --> 03:46:53.700
It's not like it's not like Pelosi said you can't make any

03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:57.500
Republicans or that there are no Republicans whatsoever.

03:46:57.900 --> 03:46:59.500
She said give me five.

03:46:59.500 --> 03:47:03.400
You just can't have these two and Kevin McCarthy refused I

03:47:03.400 --> 03:47:06.100
would argue given that there were hundreds, you know, at

03:47:06.100 --> 03:47:08.900
least 150 Republicans in the house at the time.

03:47:08.900 --> 03:47:10.300
I can't remember the exact breakdown.

03:47:10.300 --> 03:47:14.300
I think it had to be close to 200 plenty of other options.

03:47:15.300 --> 03:47:17.100
So that's that's McCarthy's fault.

03:47:17.100 --> 03:47:21.000
Not Pelosi's I would say that you're you're trying to say

03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:23.400
trying to so you're looking at this in a vacuum.

03:47:23.600 --> 03:47:28.100
Unfortunately, the Democratic the Democrats I just got out

03:47:28.100 --> 03:47:32.100
of two different impeachment attempts where the impeachment

03:47:32.100 --> 03:47:36.600
inquiry was basically rail road through by one side and

03:47:36.600 --> 03:47:41.500
so he attempted an olive branch by allowing pro-Trump voices

03:47:41.500 --> 03:47:46.500
onto the thing to give some balance to this committee, even

03:47:46.500 --> 03:47:48.400
though it was obviously the findings are going to be negative

03:47:48.400 --> 03:47:51.500
towards Trump and Republicans, but he was trying to provide

03:47:51.500 --> 03:47:55.600
some balance there and once they were rejected the two most

03:47:55.600 --> 03:47:59.700
like the most favored Republican Congressman in the nation

03:48:00.200 --> 03:48:02.500
that people like never removed from it.

03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:06.400
I there was no there was no like nobody was no Republican

03:48:06.400 --> 03:48:09.300
was going to be satisfied with McCarthy and vote for him

03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:10.300
again if he allowed it.

03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:14.300
Wait, so so so this is this is where okay.

03:48:14.300 --> 03:48:17.500
So yes impeachments tend to be partisan right now.

03:48:17.500 --> 03:48:19.900
We're experiencing a partisan impeachment the impeachment

03:48:19.900 --> 03:48:23.600
effort against president was partisan as well and Bush

03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:28.300
impeachments are partisan by definition now, so so I don't

03:48:28.300 --> 03:48:30.700
think that that has any bearing on the January 6th select

03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:33.900
committee because Pelosi said well, let's do it bipartisanly

03:48:33.900 --> 03:48:36.500
equal numbers equal subpoena power.

03:48:36.900 --> 03:48:39.800
She just said you can't have these two.

03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:42.100
That's a reasonable request to make and you say well, they

03:48:42.100 --> 03:48:43.600
needed a pro-Trump voice.

03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:46.500
I would I reject the argument or the suggestion.

03:48:46.500 --> 03:48:48.500
I'm not saying you're arguing this but the implicit the

03:48:48.500 --> 03:48:52.300
implicit suggestion of your argument is that there were no

03:48:52.300 --> 03:48:56.900
other pro-Trump voices besides Jim Banks and Jim Jordan

03:48:57.100 --> 03:48:59.200
who could have been put on that committee and I just

03:48:59.200 --> 03:49:02.100
categorically reject that there were 200 Republicans in

03:49:02.100 --> 03:49:07.400
Congress can and and and would is or to think so McCarthy

03:49:07.400 --> 03:49:11.600
chose the most respected Republicans in the nation to go

03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:14.400
on there that people liked that they could be relatively

03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:17.800
sure that people would accept being on that committee and

03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:21.400
that would be would give some good faith to it.

03:49:21.600 --> 03:49:24.700
So he picked people that would give some credibility.

03:49:24.700 --> 03:49:25.900
How could it be?

03:49:25.900 --> 03:49:26.500
I'm sorry.

03:49:26.500 --> 03:49:26.900
I'm sorry.

03:49:26.900 --> 03:49:27.400
I have to interrupt.

03:49:27.400 --> 03:49:31.600
How could it be good faith if Jim Jordan is not only pro-Trump

03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:32.600
which is fine.

03:49:32.700 --> 03:49:34.900
Yeah, but he is potentially involved.

03:49:34.900 --> 03:49:38.700
They have reason to believe that he was involved with the

03:49:38.700 --> 03:49:41.900
efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

03:49:42.600 --> 03:49:43.100
Well, let's go.

03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:44.200
Let's go with this, right?

03:49:44.400 --> 03:49:49.500
So the the other side is staffed with Democrats who have

03:49:49.700 --> 03:49:52.300
all unanimously tried to impeach Trump twice.

03:49:52.700 --> 03:49:53.100
Sure.

03:49:53.400 --> 03:49:53.600
Okay.

03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:57.100
So there was never going to be a nonpartisan in the way of

03:49:57.100 --> 03:49:58.800
not asking for not but wait a minute.

03:49:58.800 --> 03:50:00.100
I'm not asking for nonpartisan.

03:50:00.100 --> 03:50:00.800
I agree.

03:50:00.900 --> 03:50:01.300
I agree.

03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:03.200
You're not going to find you're not going to find neutral

03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:07.000
people. I'm saying they could have found other partisan

03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:10.200
Republicans who were pro-Trump that weren't potentially

03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:13.200
involved. The United States population had faith in.

03:50:14.100 --> 03:50:17.700
Like they only know Jim Jordan is the only one to have that

03:50:17.700 --> 03:50:20.200
the United States has has any faith in again.

03:50:20.200 --> 03:50:22.500
Actually, here's the issue.

03:50:23.100 --> 03:50:25.200
Trey Gowdy and Jim Jordan are there.

03:50:25.500 --> 03:50:28.400
Let me hop in here Artemis because I mean Matt Gates was

03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:28.900
in the house.

03:50:28.900 --> 03:50:29.400
Wasn't he?

03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:32.600
Isn't he like a well-known right-wing figure that people

03:50:32.600 --> 03:50:33.300
on the right trust?

03:50:33.300 --> 03:50:35.200
Like why didn't McCarthy tap him?

03:50:35.300 --> 03:50:37.500
Because Gates and McCarthy were going at it.

03:50:37.500 --> 03:50:37.900
Yeah.

03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:38.900
Okay.

03:50:38.900 --> 03:50:39.700
I mean, I don't know about that.

03:50:39.700 --> 03:50:40.800
Maybe got him removed.

03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:42.100
Yeah, correct.

03:50:42.100 --> 03:50:42.600
They were fine.

03:50:42.600 --> 03:50:43.200
They were for sure.

03:50:43.200 --> 03:50:43.300
Sure.

03:50:43.300 --> 03:50:44.200
But that was later.

03:50:44.200 --> 03:50:46.000
That was like in that was no, no, no, no.

03:50:46.100 --> 03:50:47.000
That was later.

03:50:47.300 --> 03:50:48.300
It's a long time coming.

03:50:48.800 --> 03:50:49.800
Yeah, it was like I was like, okay.

03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:50.000
Yeah.

03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:54.500
Yeah, that's he was doing an option that even for his post

03:50:54.900 --> 03:50:58.700
when he wasn't like removing McCarthy from the position

03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:01.900
McCarthy was removing him from like committee assignments.

03:51:02.300 --> 03:51:03.300
Okay, right.

03:51:03.600 --> 03:51:06.400
So I looked into into fought into the five original picks

03:51:06.400 --> 03:51:09.900
that McCarthy brought up and one of them was Troy Nels and

03:51:10.200 --> 03:51:15.800
Troy Nels was never involved in Trump's plans, but he was

03:51:15.800 --> 03:51:20.400
very pro Trump and he did, he did vote to have, you know,

03:51:20.400 --> 03:51:22.800
the ballots inspector there or the electorate inspector,

03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:24.000
whatever, whatever the case is.

03:51:24.500 --> 03:51:27.300
He was one of the guys who did that, but he wasn't involved

03:51:27.300 --> 03:51:30.200
in the, in the, you know, the Eastman memo implementation.

03:51:30.200 --> 03:51:30.600
Right.

03:51:30.900 --> 03:51:31.100
Yeah.

03:51:31.100 --> 03:51:35.500
So she didn't throw Troy Nels off of the five.

03:51:35.800 --> 03:51:38.900
So Nancy Pelosi seemed to be willing to allow, you know,

03:51:38.900 --> 03:51:43.900
very pro Trump voices onto this committee, just not the

03:51:43.900 --> 03:51:45.000
two that were involved.

03:51:45.000 --> 03:51:46.300
You're going to, you're going to, I'm going to go back

03:51:46.300 --> 03:51:51.800
to the, the, the, the Republican electorate know of Jim Jordan.

03:51:52.300 --> 03:51:53.900
He is a known quantity to them.

03:51:54.700 --> 03:51:55.200
Right.

03:51:55.400 --> 03:51:59.300
Let's see home most popular Republican Republican House.

03:51:59.300 --> 03:51:59.600
Okay.

03:51:59.600 --> 03:52:00.000
Let's see.

03:52:00.100 --> 03:52:02.700
Yeah, that's, that's, that's a, that's a comment that people

03:52:02.700 --> 03:52:04.200
are making about Jim Jordan.

03:52:04.200 --> 03:52:06.700
Now, I think if you take the polling literally that also

03:52:06.700 --> 03:52:09.400
puts Jim Jordan above Donald Trump, if I remember correctly

03:52:09.400 --> 03:52:13.100
when I cover probably from Jim Jordan's attempt at a speakership,

03:52:13.500 --> 03:52:14.800
but listen, I don't number one.

03:52:14.800 --> 03:52:17.300
I don't think that was the reason Kevin McCarthy offered

03:52:17.300 --> 03:52:20.900
at the time because to be quite frankly until Dev pointed

03:52:20.900 --> 03:52:22.900
out that Troy Nels was one of the names I couldn't even

03:52:22.900 --> 03:52:25.300
remember the other three names.

03:52:25.300 --> 03:52:28.100
So it's not like they were, you know, Kevin McCarthy was

03:52:28.100 --> 03:52:30.000
going necessarily for star power.

03:52:30.500 --> 03:52:32.800
No, no, it's not, it's not star power.

03:52:32.800 --> 03:52:35.900
It's, it's the, it's trust and faith in the system.

03:52:36.900 --> 03:52:40.400
You need trust and faith in a committee for people to believe

03:52:40.400 --> 03:52:43.300
the committee's findings and because you remove the people

03:52:43.300 --> 03:52:44.900
that would give it the most legitimacy.

03:52:45.300 --> 03:52:48.100
You're going to restore resulting is going to be distrust.

03:52:48.100 --> 03:52:49.000
Well, here, here, how about this?

03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:49.200
How about this?

03:52:49.200 --> 03:52:49.400
How about this?

03:52:49.400 --> 03:52:49.900
How about this?

03:52:49.900 --> 03:52:54.000
So, so like there's definitely a conspiracy worm in my brain

03:52:54.400 --> 03:52:59.300
that says Pelosi knowingly rejected, knowingly rejected the

03:52:59.300 --> 03:53:03.000
most popular Republicans in order to, in order to make this,

03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:07.800
you know just, just a witch hunt for the Democrats to go

03:53:07.800 --> 03:53:09.100
after Trump there.

03:53:09.100 --> 03:53:11.000
That's a conspiracy worm that I mean, it's possible.

03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:13.100
I guess it's possible, but there's an alternate

03:53:13.100 --> 03:53:16.600
conspiracy worm though, where, where basically McCarthy

03:53:16.600 --> 03:53:21.600
put forward people that, yes, McCarthy put forward people

03:53:21.600 --> 03:53:25.100
that he knew would have to be shot down because he didn't

03:53:25.100 --> 03:53:27.600
even want to be part of the proceedings at all and that

03:53:27.600 --> 03:53:29.000
gave him a justification to pull out.

03:53:30.300 --> 03:53:33.200
And paint it and paint it as partisan as a result.

03:53:33.200 --> 03:53:36.000
The issue is, is that there's no, there's no evidence of

03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:39.200
him knowing that, that that was going to take place.

03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:43.600
There's evidence of him offering what he would normally

03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:48.300
offer, the leading like Republican figure, which is Jim

03:53:48.300 --> 03:53:51.800
Jordan, a position that he asked for on the committee and

03:53:51.800 --> 03:53:54.000
then getting, they're getting rejected and then saying,

03:53:54.000 --> 03:53:55.900
okay, well, this is obviously partisan and pulling out.

03:53:56.700 --> 03:53:59.000
Like we have evidence for those two things.

03:54:00.400 --> 03:54:03.300
I think I reject some of the premises there.

03:54:03.300 --> 03:54:06.500
Number one, I don't know if that was the reason that Kevin

03:54:06.500 --> 03:54:08.900
McCarthy offered Jim Jordan in the first place.

03:54:08.900 --> 03:54:11.600
And even if it is, I don't think that if that obligates

03:54:11.600 --> 03:54:14.700
Nancy Pelosi to accept Jim Jordan, when there's sufficient

03:54:14.700 --> 03:54:18.200
reason to believe that Jim Jordan may be implicated in

03:54:18.200 --> 03:54:19.600
the scope of the investigation.

03:54:21.300 --> 03:54:24.000
Yeah, I don't, I don't, no, no, no, because it's fine.

03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:25.700
The bet, the back and forth is good, but I just don't want

03:54:25.700 --> 03:54:26.700
to lose my train of thought here.

03:54:26.700 --> 03:54:27.100
Yeah, go for it.

03:54:27.100 --> 03:54:31.600
I don't think that Nancy Pelosi was obligated to give

03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:35.400
Jim Jordan that position while knowing that, that he may

03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:37.600
be implicated in the scope of the investigation.

03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:40.500
I think it's reasonable for Nancy Pelosi to say, listen,

03:54:41.500 --> 03:54:44.000
I'm kind of being generous right now anyway, doing this

03:54:44.000 --> 03:54:48.800
9-11 style bipartisan commission and giving you all equal

03:54:48.800 --> 03:54:50.000
subpoena power.

03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:52.400
You have 200 members in your conference.

03:54:52.400 --> 03:54:56.400
You need, you can find five pro-Trump names who are trusted

03:54:56.400 --> 03:54:58.900
by their constituents to put on here.

03:54:58.900 --> 03:55:02.400
You just can't put people on here who may be implicated

03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:04.200
in the scope of the investigation.

03:55:04.700 --> 03:55:07.400
And for Kevin McCarthy to just reject that out of hand

03:55:07.400 --> 03:55:10.600
and say, listen, no, it's Jim Jordan, Jim Banks, and these

03:55:10.600 --> 03:55:12.400
other three or none at all.

03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:16.000
I think that, let me ask you this.

03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:20.300
What should, what should Pelosi have done, especially with

03:55:20.300 --> 03:55:23.900
hindsight? Hindsight, if she wanted the J-6 committee's

03:55:23.900 --> 03:55:27.600
findings to be considered anywhere credible, she should

03:55:27.600 --> 03:55:28.800
have had Jim Jordan on there.

03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:31.300
Regardless of whether or not he would have been called to

03:55:31.300 --> 03:55:34.700
testify, they could have that instance happen where the

03:55:34.700 --> 03:55:38.500
committee calls Jim Jordan to testify and he just publicly

03:55:38.500 --> 03:55:40.100
says, no, I'm not doing it.

03:55:40.200 --> 03:55:41.400
I would be fine with that.

03:55:42.100 --> 03:55:43.500
I'm sure you would be.

03:55:43.500 --> 03:55:44.600
I just don't know.

03:55:44.600 --> 03:55:49.100
Let me, I don't think you would ever accept it if the shoe

03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:50.200
was on the other foot.

03:55:50.200 --> 03:55:53.900
Hey, give this Democrat witness who may be investigated and

03:55:53.900 --> 03:55:57.600
put him in a position to influence the investigation in

03:55:57.600 --> 03:55:59.600
question with equal subpoena power.

03:56:00.400 --> 03:56:02.700
I don't think you would accept that nor should you, quite

03:56:02.700 --> 03:56:04.400
frankly, that would be absurd.

03:56:04.500 --> 03:56:07.800
We had to accept that during the crossfire hurricane and

03:56:07.800 --> 03:56:13.100
the special counsel for Robert.

03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:13.700
What was it?

03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:14.800
Robert Mueller.

03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:17.900
Okay, before you get into that, I know I'm now an hour

03:56:17.900 --> 03:56:20.700
late and I have to go before you get into that.

03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:22.600
We are, I have one final question.

03:56:22.600 --> 03:56:24.600
Can you give me like the 32nd version of it?

03:56:24.700 --> 03:56:29.600
Just the other instance of, I have heard something about

03:56:29.700 --> 03:56:31.800
the January 6th committee destroying evidence.

03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:33.300
It wasn't just nonsense.

03:56:33.300 --> 03:56:36.500
I read an LA Times article about how some of it was destroyed.

03:56:36.700 --> 03:56:37.500
What was the deal there?

03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:41.700
Um, I know the, how do I say this?

03:56:42.300 --> 03:56:44.900
So there was supposed to be exculpatory evidence that some

03:56:44.900 --> 03:56:50.400
of the defendants were asking for that like videotapes of

03:56:50.400 --> 03:56:54.300
themselves and how they were caught or whatever and they

03:56:54.300 --> 03:56:55.600
weren't given any of that.

03:56:56.200 --> 03:56:58.700
And then when they went to go asking for it, they said they

03:56:58.700 --> 03:57:00.200
didn't have it and didn't have to give it.

03:57:00.700 --> 03:57:04.000
And then when the Republicans were taking over the house

03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:07.200
and the committee was told to preserve all of the data,

03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:11.000
they didn't and then now it's no longer in existence.

03:57:11.500 --> 03:57:15.600
Yeah, so from the LA Times article on the topic, possession

03:57:15.600 --> 03:57:18.100
of the massive trove of evidence collected by the committee

03:57:18.100 --> 03:57:20.800
was long expected to remain an issue on Capitol Hill once

03:57:20.800 --> 03:57:22.100
the panel's work was done.

03:57:22.500 --> 03:57:25.300
The select committee's 18 month investigation is believed

03:57:25.300 --> 03:57:28.200
to be among the most extensive probes in congressional history,

03:57:28.500 --> 03:57:31.900
but much of it was done behind closed doors, so the full

03:57:31.900 --> 03:57:33.500
extent of what was collected is unknown.

03:57:33.900 --> 03:57:35.700
Committee staff spoke with more than a thousand people

03:57:35.700 --> 03:57:38.300
for the investigation, which resulted in millions of pages

03:57:38.300 --> 03:57:43.500
of depositions, cell phone and text records, emails, staff

03:57:43.500 --> 03:57:45.600
notes, and analysis by outside organizations.

03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:49.200
Official records are typically handed over to a successor

03:57:49.200 --> 03:57:52.100
committee, then to the house clerk and eventually to the

03:57:52.100 --> 03:57:55.700
national archives where they're shielded by law from public

03:57:55.700 --> 03:57:57.300
view for at least 30 years.

03:57:57.300 --> 03:57:59.900
When Republicans took control of the house in January,

03:58:00.500 --> 03:58:03.700
they included something new in the rules for the 118th

03:58:03.700 --> 03:58:06.700
Congress, an order that all documents that were retained

03:58:06.700 --> 03:58:09.500
from the house January 6 committee go to the house

03:58:09.500 --> 03:58:10.600
administration committee.

03:58:11.100 --> 03:58:13.500
All materials already sent to the national archives

03:58:13.500 --> 03:58:14.800
were to be returned.

03:58:16.500 --> 03:58:19.200
But I guess because this was from a new Congress,

03:58:19.200 --> 03:58:20.900
they didn't honor that rule because it took place

03:58:20.900 --> 03:58:21.900
in the previous Congress.

03:58:22.100 --> 03:58:25.700
The leader of the committee said that he didn't think

03:58:26.200 --> 03:58:29.100
they were, that he needed to preserve them so he didn't

03:58:30.200 --> 03:58:31.900
is the, I think the direct quote.

03:58:33.100 --> 03:58:36.100
If you, if I'm looking at that article with you because

03:58:36.100 --> 03:58:38.700
again, I've heard this allegation as well.

03:58:38.900 --> 03:58:42.600
I recall fact-checkers saying that it was not true, that

03:58:42.600 --> 03:58:45.000
evidence was not knowingly destroyed.

03:58:45.000 --> 03:58:48.300
If you read on those articles, it says that house rule,

03:58:48.300 --> 03:58:51.900
it looks like seven, job lines preservation of house records

03:58:51.900 --> 03:58:54.000
at the end of each two-year Congress and has been used

03:58:54.000 --> 03:58:57.000
by nearly every Congress including the current one loosely

03:58:57.000 --> 03:58:58.700
defines what has to be preserved.

03:58:58.700 --> 03:59:01.200
It says the committee should preserve quote an official

03:59:01.200 --> 03:59:03.700
permanent record of the committee including any record

03:59:03.700 --> 03:59:06.700
of a legislative oversight or any or other activity of

03:59:06.700 --> 03:59:08.400
such committee or subcommittee thereof.

03:59:08.700 --> 03:59:11.200
What committees consider an official record have varied

03:59:11.200 --> 03:59:12.300
widely over the years.

03:59:12.300 --> 03:59:14.700
For some, the definition includes transcripts, official

03:59:14.700 --> 03:59:16.700
correspondence, and drafts of legislation.

03:59:17.200 --> 03:59:19.600
Other committees might include staff notes and internal

03:59:19.600 --> 03:59:23.300
memos. Some preserve only their final report and notices

03:59:23.300 --> 03:59:26.500
of hearings that were held. McCarthy, who is now speaker,

03:59:26.500 --> 03:59:28.900
sent Benny Thompson a letter in December demanding the

03:59:28.900 --> 03:59:32.300
preservation of all records collected and transcripts of

03:59:32.300 --> 03:59:35.200
testimony taken during your investigation in accordance

03:59:35.200 --> 03:59:38.200
with house rules, but he had no authority to enforce it

03:59:38.200 --> 03:59:40.900
because the committee disbanded moments before the new

03:59:40.900 --> 03:59:44.000
Congress controlled by Republicans was sworn in, their

03:59:44.000 --> 03:59:46.900
new rule for ordering preservation of any non-concurrent

03:59:46.900 --> 03:59:49.600
records from the committee could only apply to records

03:59:49.600 --> 03:59:52.400
that had already been transferred to a successor committee

03:59:52.400 --> 03:59:55.500
or to the National Archives. In essence, the Republicans

03:59:55.500 --> 03:59:58.400
couldn't order the Jan 6 select committee to turn anything

03:59:58.400 --> 04:00:00.700
over because it didn't exist existed.

04:00:00.700 --> 04:00:01.700
Yeah, I read that one.

04:00:02.000 --> 04:00:05.800
Yeah, and that tells me that because it because they because

04:00:05.800 --> 04:00:09.000
it the new rule didn't take into place until after the

04:00:09.000 --> 04:00:13.200
J6 committee was torn down and McCarthy didn't have any

04:00:13.200 --> 04:00:15.400
power to tell them to hold on to it.

04:00:15.500 --> 04:00:19.700
They decided not to keep it or that that tells me that

04:00:20.200 --> 04:00:22.900
But if you if you read two paragraphs down, do you see

04:00:22.900 --> 04:00:26.200
the step that Thompson said the select committee was not

04:00:26.200 --> 04:00:29.100
obligated to archive all video recordings of transcribed

04:00:29.100 --> 04:00:31.800
interviews or depositions, but determined that written

04:00:31.800 --> 04:00:33.400
transcripts were sufficient.

04:00:33.400 --> 04:00:36.900
So there is a record just not the total record that Republicans

04:00:36.900 --> 04:00:38.500
wanted which was apparently the video tape.

04:00:38.500 --> 04:00:39.400
So here's the thing.

04:00:39.400 --> 04:00:40.200
Here's the thing, right?

04:00:40.300 --> 04:00:42.600
Well, let me jump in here because I do I do have to go

04:00:42.600 --> 04:00:43.100
right now.

04:00:43.300 --> 04:00:44.200
We got a gang.

04:00:44.200 --> 04:00:44.800
I'm hungry.

04:00:44.800 --> 04:00:45.400
I'm starving.

04:00:45.400 --> 04:00:48.100
Yeah, you get angry with get a snicker.

04:00:49.100 --> 04:00:53.200
So basically like like I know that this is the legal proceeding.

04:00:53.200 --> 04:00:57.000
It's probably all done above board in terms of the the letter

04:00:57.000 --> 04:01:01.300
of the law, but as a data hoarder personally, I don't like

04:01:01.300 --> 04:01:05.900
the idea of stuff due to a rule being like arbitrarily destroyed

04:01:05.900 --> 04:01:08.700
or deleted or not able to be seen anymore that just bothers

04:01:08.700 --> 04:01:12.500
me in a personal level because I like to keep I hoard every

04:01:12.500 --> 04:01:15.000
single thing that I come across in case it's useful for later

04:01:15.200 --> 04:01:18.900
every slip of paper every link every weird conspiracy Theory.

04:01:18.900 --> 04:01:21.200
I keep it all backed up somewhere penis doodle.

04:01:22.900 --> 04:01:24.600
Hoarders episode for you somewhere.

04:01:24.600 --> 04:01:27.100
I'm sure yeah, I hoard data.

04:01:27.100 --> 04:01:28.300
I hoard data like crazy.

04:01:28.300 --> 04:01:32.200
So when I hear this like I don't know if this could be used

04:01:32.200 --> 04:01:35.100
legally, but it does make me think like why don't you just

04:01:35.100 --> 04:01:36.300
why don't you just keep it guys?

04:01:36.500 --> 04:01:40.000
Like what the fuck there is it raises questions that didn't

04:01:40.000 --> 04:01:40.700
need to be raised.

04:01:40.800 --> 04:01:44.900
But um before we go up, I just want to thank you Doug for

04:01:44.900 --> 04:01:47.800
coming on spend some time with me and collabing with me

04:01:47.800 --> 04:01:48.100
a bit.

04:01:48.100 --> 04:01:52.200
I'll put my check to you in the mail because this is business

04:01:52.200 --> 04:01:53.100
transaction, right?

04:01:53.300 --> 04:01:55.200
You saw that tweet funny.

04:01:55.200 --> 04:01:56.500
Oh my God.

04:01:56.700 --> 04:01:56.800
Okay.

04:01:56.800 --> 04:01:59.600
There was like a vtuber who was saying like listen every

04:01:59.600 --> 04:02:01.800
every time you collab with someone like someone's got to

04:02:01.800 --> 04:02:02.800
be paying someone.

04:02:03.100 --> 04:02:04.700
It's all it's all transactional.

04:02:04.700 --> 04:02:06.900
There's no real friendships in the online space.

04:02:07.100 --> 04:02:09.400
It's like what the fuck it like are you sociopathic?

04:02:09.400 --> 04:02:10.800
What are they living in?

04:02:10.800 --> 04:02:13.500
This is all friendship based which I mean great terrible

04:02:13.500 --> 04:02:14.700
at the same time, right?

04:02:15.000 --> 04:02:16.800
Dev asks me for money all the time.

04:02:17.000 --> 04:02:19.100
Oh, well, yeah, that's because that's because you make a

04:02:19.100 --> 04:02:21.800
cake on that's because you make six figures a month.

04:02:22.100 --> 04:02:23.700
I don't care what I'm on.

04:02:24.000 --> 04:02:24.700
Holy shit.

04:02:24.700 --> 04:02:24.900
Right.

04:02:24.900 --> 04:02:25.300
Okay.

04:02:25.300 --> 04:02:28.200
I look yeah sidebar what we'll take letter.

04:02:28.300 --> 04:02:32.800
We'll take what I knew but for now gang Josiah, thank you

for coming on Artemis really appreciate your perspective

04:02:35.400 --> 04:02:36.000
as well.

04:02:36.200 --> 04:02:38.400
I would love to have like a more sit-down thing about this.

04:02:38.400 --> 04:02:40.800
But again, you caught me when I'm trapped.

04:02:40.800 --> 04:02:42.100
I was going to go to McDonald's now.

04:02:42.100 --> 04:02:43.400
I can't because it's closed.

04:02:43.500 --> 04:02:44.400
So fuck all of you.

04:02:45.100 --> 04:02:45.900
I'll see you guys later.

Eastern and we're going to have a bunch of alpha males explained

04:02:54.700 --> 04:02:59.400
to those silly women why feminism has succeeded for them.

04:02:59.500 --> 04:03:02.400
Whereas the women the silly silly women that they are are

04:03:02.400 --> 04:03:05.500
going to explain why modern feminism has failed them.

04:03:05.700 --> 04:03:08.200
So it should be a fun debate should be a fun discussion tune

04:03:08.200 --> 04:03:09.400
in 6 30 p.m.

04:03:09.500 --> 04:03:11.500
