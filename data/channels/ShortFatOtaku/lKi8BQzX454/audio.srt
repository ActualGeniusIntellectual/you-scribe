1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,740
So recently, or at least recently for me, y'all know what kind of a slowpoke I am,

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,840
an audience member at a Dave Chappelle stand-up event bum-rushed the stage, hoping to attack

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,840
the comedian.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,600
It didn't end well for him, but YouTube goes very hard on showing violence or saying

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,680
curse words during the first minute of any video, so I'm going to have to hold off

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,520
on actually describing that event for a little bit.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,660
I don't know why that stuff is fine later on, maybe it's because YouTube's censors

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,360
only have time to watch the first minute before they lazily check the box saying it's

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
all good and move on?

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,060
Yes, I'm currently talking about you, Mr. YouTube Censor, who's got the unlucky job

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,600
of manually confirming my video from monetization today.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
How are you doing?

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Did you get enough coffee?

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, dude.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
I know what kind of videos you've got to confirm next.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,220
Maybe now is the time to go back to school, you know, you've been putting it off for

17
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,420
like seven years, pursue that dream job, it's got to be better than being the corpo lap

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,060
dog for two bucks above minimum wage, you know?

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,540
Anyway, this all started with the Dave Chappelle Netflix controversy.

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,460
Netflix had paid Chappelle for six comedy specials.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,540
The fifth one, called Sticks and Stones, came out in 2019 with a secret epilogue called

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,540
The Punch Line.

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,120
In it, Chappelle said that during one of his previous performances, he made jokes at the

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,640
expense of trans people and a trans woman in the audience, Daphne Dorman, laughed loudly

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,060
enough to actually disrupt the performance.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,220
They ended up talking after the show, where Dorman thanked Chappelle for normalizing transgender

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,000
people by telling jokes about them.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,300
This new friendship culminated with Dorman being the opening act for that very same Sticks

29
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,300
and Stones show.

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,880
Two years later, Chappelle's sixth comedy special, The Closer, came out.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,820
In it, he described how, after Dorman's association with him, she received an extreme

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,380
amount of online harassment for defending Chappelle's comedy and associating with

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,180
him in any capacity, and that harassment eventually led to her suicide.

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, the trans activists, so concerned with ideological purity, so distrusting of the

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,640
subversive nature of comedy, and so very personally aware of the high suicide rates and fragile

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,220
mental states of trans people, bullied a trans woman to suicide because she associated with

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,240
their political enemy.

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,380
This is why, when these people shriek, trans rights, trans lives matter, you're literally

39
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,300
killing trans people, I just don't care anymore.

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,480
Because they don't care.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,400
They don't hold these things as values.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,520
They have no problem violating trans rights, devaluing trans lives, and leaving trans corpses

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,500
in their wake as long as they're the ones doing it.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,740
Political transness claims dominion over the trans individual.

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,600
She is theirs to let live and theirs to kill as it suits their interest.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,400
If she dies without their consent, then the enemy may have killed a person, but more importantly

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,880
to them, the enemy has stolen from the ideology.

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,360
Oh, and by the way, political blackness interacts with Black Lives Matter in the same way.

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,120
Hey, Mr. YouTube Censor, if you're still here, don't worry.

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
I understand why I'm not getting any money for this one.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
I don't take it personally.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
You're just doing your job.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
I'm still correct though.

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,540
In any case, I found myself at the point where I just don't care if the mainstream calls

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
Dave Chappelle transphobic.

56
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
I don't believe he's transphobic.

57
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,120
I believe that they are more transphobic than he is, in fact, despite his jokes, because

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,880
unlike them, jokes are all he's got on his hands.

59
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Like, listen to this.

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,940
This is a clip from that Netflix walkout.

61
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,880
We need to say it's not okay.

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,120
This hate conversation was not their intention.

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,960
We understand that jokes are jokes, things are things, but at the end of the day, if

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,640
it's promoting hate and it's promoting discrimination, you are directly a cause of it if you're allowing

65
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,780
it to happen and you're not doing anything about it.

66
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,240
And that goes for anyone in this country, specifically people of power in the entertainment

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
industry.

68
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,780
It's that same totalizing.

69
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,780
Everything is political.

70
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,320
Everything must exist outside of our hegemony worldview.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,680
That walkout ended up going nowhere though, even though it was highly publicized.

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,200
And when it came out, the people were fired over this whole shit show.

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,860
It wasn't necessarily because they walked out.

74
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,740
It was because they burst into a board meeting demanding to be heard.

75
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,220
And it was because they leaked Netflix's private information on the closer to the press and

76
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,220
protest.

77
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,920
By the end of all of this, Chappelle came out of it smelling like roses.

78
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
He wasn't canceled.

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,260
And I genuinely think that we've now reached the hump, the limits of woke overreach.

80
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,340
We're cresting the wave.

81
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,420
Chappelle got through it.

82
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,980
Elon Musk got through it and won.

83
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,660
And it turns out he's actually a secret 2016 year anti-SJW bro.

84
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,780
Other people who would have been canceled two years ago nowadays just say fuck off and

85
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,780
ignore it.

86
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,820
Nobody is phased anymore by being baselessly called racist or fascist or whatever else.

87
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,240
Every wokeoid tactic is failing right in front of everybody's eyes, in public, live on display.

88
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,400
The culture is slowly but finally breaking free of the shackles the left has put on it.

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,140
And of course, some people are naturally enraged by this series of events, which is where that

90
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,260
attack on Dave Chappelle comes in.

91
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,700
A 23 year old is charged with trying to attack Dave Chappelle.

92
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,100
Attacker armed with knife and replica gun tackled comedian during Netflix gig during

93
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,700
set about how the woke brigade tried to cancel him over trans jokes.

94
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for hip hop history.

95
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Thank God that was clumsy.

96
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,700
He's back there getting stomped.

97
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,700
Where did it come from?

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,700
It was a it was a trans man.

99
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,500
Was that Will Smith?

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,420
This dude charged the fucking stage over Chappelle's trans jokes and then his security kick the

101
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420
shit out of him.

102
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Hey, you can't claim that Chappelle's transphobic.

103
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,780
He just helped transition this guy into a pretzel.

104
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,420
Look at his fucking arm, dude.

105
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,860
He's being wheeled out of place on the stretcher and they just have his family guy ass twisted

106
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,700
snapped arm locked into place.

107
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Holy shit.

108
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,420
So the fellow who did it, it turns out he's actually a rapper.

109
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,500
And on his soundcloud, he posted a song he called Dave Chappelle.

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
No joke.

111
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Walk straight into the boat.

112
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
You know, when they gave to me.

113
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,100
Yeah, I don't know if you could tell through all that fucking mumbling, but he said walking

114
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,960
straight into the bowl, referencing the Hollywood Bowl, the venue that Chappelle was performing

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,220
in when the attack took place.

116
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,020
And despite everybody seeing it, despite all the videos, despite his fucking arm and everything

117
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,580
else, despite the rap song providing premeditation, he still pleaded not guilty.

118
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,140
How in the fuck?

119
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,100
And no, that wasn't the same person as this individual whose tweet of Dave Chappelle,

120
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,780
you're next come from my trans homies again, and I swear to God went retroactively viral.

121
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Come on, guys.

122
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,300
That doesn't even look like the attacker.

123
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,100
I will say, though, scrolling through their feed makes me wish they were.

124
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,260
This person is cancerous as fuck and can use a few years in jail just to be off Twitter.

125
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
Here's the thing.

126
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,940
Comedy was always meant to be the release valve for society where you could say edgy,

127
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
even heinous shit.

128
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,420
You could make gay jokes and black jokes and trans jokes and Holocaust jokes and whatever

129
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,420
the fuck else you wanted, because part of recognizing and celebrating differences is

130
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,340
banter between individuals with difference.

131
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,780
Part of putting the past behind us is bantering about that past.

132
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,940
And either you banter in a friendly manner or you fight as enemies.

133
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,700
When a society cannot tell racist jokes as a method of normalizing difference, then they

134
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,380
will commit racist acts out of ignorance of that difference.

135
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,700
One of the greatest comedy shows of all time, what some even call the best there ever was,

136
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,220
is Eddie Murphy's Delirious from 1983.

137
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,500
And the jokes in it would make a Prague shit with rage if they ever went back and watched

138
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
it.

139
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,740
Eddie Murphy has since disavowed it multiple times, most recently in 2019.

140
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,160
It is funny, though, to see his disavowal from 1996.

141
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Just like the rest of the world, I am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in

142
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
1981.

143
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,080
I think it's unfair to take the words of a misinformed 21-year-old and apply them to

144
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,860
an informed 35-year-old man.

145
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,280
I know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over.

146
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,580
I know that AIDS isn't funny.

147
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,400
It's 1996, and I'm a lot smarter about AIDS now.

148
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,600
People were making its current year arguments 25 years ago, and although this is a statement

149
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,340
with contents that any 2022 wokeoid would accept, it was made in 1996 using the same

150
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,060
its current year logic during an era that Prague's nowadays view as being insufferably

151
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
racist.

152
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,940
Anyway, many people would say that Delirious was the height of comedy, and while there's

153
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,940
since been great comedy, nothing has quite topped it.

154
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
That's a common opinion.

155
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,140
And yet it was raunchy, edgy, and even dark sometimes.

156
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,300
It was not for the faint of heart.

157
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
And that's okay.

158
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Does anybody remember Hannah Gadsby's Netflix comedy special Nanette?

159
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
No?

160
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Nobody?

161
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Does anybody even know who she is?

162
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,640
The only reason I know about her is because Nanette, despite getting high critic scores

163
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,840
on Rotten Tomatoes, is considered god-fucking-awful, and you don't even need to go and watch

164
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
it to know why.

165
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,720
Lord knows I wouldn't subject you to that shit.

166
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,760
Look at the synopsis of the specials we've discussed today.

167
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,560
The closer begins with Dave Chappelle joking about COVID-19 and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

168
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,620
Sticks and Stones begins with Chappelle joking about some celebrity news.

169
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,280
In Delirious, Eddie Murphy talks about kids who could afford ice cream from a passing

170
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,960
ice cream truck, and how they would mock kids who couldn't afford it.

171
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,280
In Nanette, Gadsby deconstructs the nature of comedy and its conventions by having her

172
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,160
audience undergo the same tension in which marginalized people suffer on a daily basis.

173
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,760
Oh boy, sign me up.

174
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,660
It was clear to anybody with a brain that Nanette just sucked.

175
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,880
But one part of the weekly Twitter news cycle back in like 2018 is how dumbfuck journalists

176
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,120
kept trying to prop it up.

177
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,880
Kind of like how recently they kept publishing pro-Cowboy Bebop live-action articles.

178
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,040
Bill Maher's stand-up comedy's past, Hannah Gadsby represents its future.

179
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
How?

180
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
By being not funny?

181
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,040
If you look at what both performers have served up as examples of their personal best, it's

182
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,600
hard not to be embarrassed for Bill, as well as anyone else in comedy who feels more kinship

183
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,660
with him than with somebody like Gadsby.

184
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,860
The Tasmanian comics Nanette, which shifts from a typical joke-driven stand-up special

185
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,900
into an explanation of why she's quitting comedy, delves into her personal biography

186
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,120
as a lesbian woman struggling to express her authentic self as a student of visual art

187
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,340
history, who scrutinized Western art painted mainly by straight white men that she unquestionably

188
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,400
accepted as masters because of their reputation.

189
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,900
Why would this make me embarrassed for Bill Maher?

190
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,420
If anything, it makes me embarrassed for Hannah.

191
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,700
People paid tickets for this shit, strapped themselves in for a night of fun, and turned

192
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,620
around and got a demoralizing lecture.

193
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,380
Of course, as the net continued to bomb, back in 2018 we kept seeing more articles pop up

194
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,380
on the topic.

195
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,820
How funny does comedy need to be?

196
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Eight signs.

197
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,500
You're watching a post-comedy comedy.

198
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,700
Post-comedy, by the way, is the deconstruction of comedy.

199
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,780
In other words, it's not there to be funny, it's there to preach at you.

200
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
You got suckered into it, chump.

201
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,820
Now you gotta listen to this Karen tell you about how hard it is to be a lesbian in a

202
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
first world country.

203
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Now some post-comedy can be a little bit funny, depending on your mood.

204
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,700
I'm fine with extremely dark comedy, and some of those eight signs are absolutely part of

205
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
dark comedy.

206
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,780
Like the grim plot movers, real human bodies often in pain, and existential dread.

207
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,080
And of course they have reversing expectations in there because fuck you, I guess.

208
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,580
But post-comedy is kind of like dark chocolate.

209
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,920
It's good in small amounts, but you can't have too much of it or else your heart will

210
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
die.

211
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,900
I have to refer back to Antonio Gramsci once again.

212
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,460
Seriously guys, read this man's writing.

213
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,260
Gramsci's contribution to the communist movement was his theory of cultural hegemony.

214
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,740
He believed that the bourgeoisie maintained capitalism not only through violence in the

215
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,460
realm of politics and coercion in the realm of economics, but indoctrination in the realm

216
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
of culture.

217
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,740
The culture of a given nation was therefore a product of the ruling class, legitimizing

218
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,780
their rule, such that values of the bourgeoisie became the common sense of the nation's working

219
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,780
class.

220
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,540
In other words, Gramsci believed that the normal values that a society is built upon

221
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,140
that grew organically out of the traditions that were passed on through generations.

222
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,020
Instead, he believed that it was an ideology enforced by the ruling class, taught by the

223
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,260
ruling class, to benefit the ruling class.

224
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,780
Gramsci therefore believed that a socialist revolution could only happen if the socialists

225
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,840
created, propagated, and eventually enforced an alternative culture that would eventually

226
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,440
become hegemonic and displace the old traditional one.

227
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,420
The revolutionary working class, as the socialists envisioned them, could not only seize the

228
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,820
means of production in an economic sense, nor could they only implement a dictatorship

229
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,380
of the proletariat in a political sense.

230
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,260
They also had to create a culture that would make people want to revolt and want to participate

231
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,900
in these new structures after they had taken hold.

232
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,940
Gramsci considered intellectuals to be the class that produced cultural hegemony.

233
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,760
Schools by necessity indoctrinate youth into something, so Gramsci believed that they should

234
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,720
indoctrinate them into socialism rather than capitalism or religiosity or any other kind

235
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
of ideology.

236
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,880
Entertainment, by necessity, has to appeal to some kind of value system, so Gramsci believed

237
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,700
that it should appeal to socialist values over any other set of values.

238
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,300
Hegemonicism, by necessity, had to report events with some kind of bias since nobody's

239
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,780
truly neutral, so Gramsci believed that it should present events in a way that benefits

240
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
socialism.

241
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,940
Even though Gramsci would ultimately be killed by the Italian fascists, his theory of cultural

242
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,940
hegemony was nearly identical to the fascists' totalizing worldview, and the theory would

243
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,300
later be adopted by the Soviet Union for use both at home as well as abroad in their Active

244
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,180
Measures Demoralization campaign.

245
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,500
So the purpose of all of this is to create media that demoralizes you, that makes you

246
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,620
hate yourself, your home, your friends and your family, your culture, your country, your

247
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,620
civilization.

248
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,980
There may even be good reasons for this hate too.

249
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,240
None of these things are perfect, everyone's got flaws, and you certainly shouldn't just

250
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,540
go on doing bad things because it's traditional.

251
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,340
You shouldn't go on letting yourself be worse than you could be because you've always

252
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
been this way.

253
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,040
But demoralization isn't critique for the purpose of improvement, it's deconstruction

254
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,380
for the purpose of replacement.

255
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,680
It serves to make you hate yourself for your faults, to the point that you desperately

256
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,940
wish to be somebody else, rather than strive to overcome those faults and become the best

257
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,140
possible version of yourself that you can be, to benefit both you and those around you.

258
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,100
This conversation is far beyond Dave Chappelle at this point.

259
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,780
But I think this is what's at the center of all of this stuff.

260
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,980
All the awful woke infiltration of media from movies to shows to games to comics that is

261
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,680
preachy unlike anything we've seen in 50 years.

262
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,700
And all the cancel culture shit for people who don't comply, who speak out against

263
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,940
what they view as obvious political subversion, or hell, who don't even care about politics

264
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,960
at all, they just think that what they're watching is bad.

265
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,860
It all relates back to subversion and hegemony.

266
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,580
The creation of an alternative culture to supplant the old one.

267
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,000
A culture that will consider a socialist revolution to be a moral necessity, rather than the evil

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,480
that it obviously is.

269
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,960
People like Dave Chappelle are way more common than anybody realizes, due to the steady and

270
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,320
slow establishment of this new hegemony.

271
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,960
And thankfully, these people are also becoming more vocal as we slowly break away from this

272
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
new hegemony.

273
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,440
If you're in this camp, you should also be more vocal in whatever small way you can

274
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
too.

275
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,060
The more we unshackle ourselves from this garbage, the more we're going to see attacks

276
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,400
like this happen, I think, as people watch all of their subversive efforts over the past

277
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,600
decade begin to crumble away, as liberalism and individualism begin to reassert itself,

278
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,520
they're going to get more desperate, and there's probably going to be more political

279
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,120
violence before it gets any better.

280
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,760
Buckle up kids, it's going to be a wild ride.
