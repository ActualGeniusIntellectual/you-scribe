WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.740
So recently, or at least recently for me, y'all know what kind of a slowpoke I am,

00:09.740 --> 00:13.840
an audience member at a Dave Chappelle stand-up event bum-rushed the stage, hoping to attack

00:13.840 --> 00:14.840
the comedian.

00:14.840 --> 00:18.600
It didn't end well for him, but YouTube goes very hard on showing violence or saying

00:18.600 --> 00:21.680
curse words during the first minute of any video, so I'm going to have to hold off

00:21.680 --> 00:23.520
on actually describing that event for a little bit.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.660
I don't know why that stuff is fine later on, maybe it's because YouTube's censors

00:26.660 --> 00:30.360
only have time to watch the first minute before they lazily check the box saying it's

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
all good and move on?

00:31.360 --> 00:35.060
Yes, I'm currently talking about you, Mr. YouTube Censor, who's got the unlucky job

00:35.060 --> 00:37.600
of manually confirming my video from monetization today.

00:37.600 --> 00:38.600
How are you doing?

00:38.600 --> 00:39.600
Did you get enough coffee?

00:39.600 --> 00:40.600
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, dude.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.600
I know what kind of videos you've got to confirm next.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.220
Maybe now is the time to go back to school, you know, you've been putting it off for

00:45.220 --> 00:49.420
like seven years, pursue that dream job, it's got to be better than being the corpo lap

00:49.420 --> 00:52.060
dog for two bucks above minimum wage, you know?

00:52.060 --> 00:55.540
Anyway, this all started with the Dave Chappelle Netflix controversy.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.460
Netflix had paid Chappelle for six comedy specials.

00:58.460 --> 01:02.540
The fifth one, called Sticks and Stones, came out in 2019 with a secret epilogue called

01:02.540 --> 01:03.540
The Punch Line.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.120
In it, Chappelle said that during one of his previous performances, he made jokes at the

01:07.120 --> 01:11.640
expense of trans people and a trans woman in the audience, Daphne Dorman, laughed loudly

01:11.640 --> 01:14.060
enough to actually disrupt the performance.

01:14.060 --> 01:18.220
They ended up talking after the show, where Dorman thanked Chappelle for normalizing transgender

01:18.220 --> 01:20.000
people by telling jokes about them.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.300
This new friendship culminated with Dorman being the opening act for that very same Sticks

01:24.300 --> 01:25.300
and Stones show.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.880
Two years later, Chappelle's sixth comedy special, The Closer, came out.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.820
In it, he described how, after Dorman's association with him, she received an extreme

01:32.820 --> 01:36.380
amount of online harassment for defending Chappelle's comedy and associating with

01:36.380 --> 01:40.180
him in any capacity, and that harassment eventually led to her suicide.

01:40.180 --> 01:45.000
Yes, the trans activists, so concerned with ideological purity, so distrusting of the

01:45.000 --> 01:50.640
subversive nature of comedy, and so very personally aware of the high suicide rates and fragile

01:50.640 --> 01:55.220
mental states of trans people, bullied a trans woman to suicide because she associated with

01:55.220 --> 01:56.240
their political enemy.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.380
This is why, when these people shriek, trans rights, trans lives matter, you're literally

02:00.380 --> 02:04.300
killing trans people, I just don't care anymore.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.480
Because they don't care.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.400
They don't hold these things as values.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.520
They have no problem violating trans rights, devaluing trans lives, and leaving trans corpses

02:12.520 --> 02:15.500
in their wake as long as they're the ones doing it.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.740
Political transness claims dominion over the trans individual.

02:18.740 --> 02:22.600
She is theirs to let live and theirs to kill as it suits their interest.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.400
If she dies without their consent, then the enemy may have killed a person, but more importantly

02:26.400 --> 02:28.880
to them, the enemy has stolen from the ideology.

02:28.880 --> 02:34.360
Oh, and by the way, political blackness interacts with Black Lives Matter in the same way.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.120
Hey, Mr. YouTube Censor, if you're still here, don't worry.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.280
I understand why I'm not getting any money for this one.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.280
I don't take it personally.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.280
You're just doing your job.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.280
I'm still correct though.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.540
In any case, I found myself at the point where I just don't care if the mainstream calls

02:45.540 --> 02:46.540
Dave Chappelle transphobic.

02:46.540 --> 02:47.540
I don't believe he's transphobic.

02:47.540 --> 02:51.120
I believe that they are more transphobic than he is, in fact, despite his jokes, because

02:51.120 --> 02:53.880
unlike them, jokes are all he's got on his hands.

02:53.880 --> 02:54.880
Like, listen to this.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.940
This is a clip from that Netflix walkout.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.880
We need to say it's not okay.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.120
This hate conversation was not their intention.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.960
We understand that jokes are jokes, things are things, but at the end of the day, if

03:04.960 --> 03:09.640
it's promoting hate and it's promoting discrimination, you are directly a cause of it if you're allowing

03:09.640 --> 03:11.780
it to happen and you're not doing anything about it.

03:11.780 --> 03:16.240
And that goes for anyone in this country, specifically people of power in the entertainment

03:16.240 --> 03:17.240
industry.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.780
It's that same totalizing.

03:18.780 --> 03:19.780
Everything is political.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.320
Everything must exist outside of our hegemony worldview.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.680
That walkout ended up going nowhere though, even though it was highly publicized.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.200
And when it came out, the people were fired over this whole shit show.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.860
It wasn't necessarily because they walked out.

03:29.860 --> 03:32.740
It was because they burst into a board meeting demanding to be heard.

03:32.740 --> 03:37.220
And it was because they leaked Netflix's private information on the closer to the press and

03:37.220 --> 03:38.220
protest.

03:38.220 --> 03:40.920
By the end of all of this, Chappelle came out of it smelling like roses.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.920
He wasn't canceled.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.260
And I genuinely think that we've now reached the hump, the limits of woke overreach.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.340
We're cresting the wave.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.420
Chappelle got through it.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.980
Elon Musk got through it and won.

03:48.980 --> 03:52.660
And it turns out he's actually a secret 2016 year anti-SJW bro.

03:52.660 --> 03:56.780
Other people who would have been canceled two years ago nowadays just say fuck off and

03:56.780 --> 03:57.780
ignore it.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.820
Nobody is phased anymore by being baselessly called racist or fascist or whatever else.

04:01.820 --> 04:07.240
Every wokeoid tactic is failing right in front of everybody's eyes, in public, live on display.

04:07.240 --> 04:12.400
The culture is slowly but finally breaking free of the shackles the left has put on it.

04:12.400 --> 04:17.140
And of course, some people are naturally enraged by this series of events, which is where that

04:17.140 --> 04:18.260
attack on Dave Chappelle comes in.

04:18.700 --> 04:21.700
A 23 year old is charged with trying to attack Dave Chappelle.

04:21.700 --> 04:26.100
Attacker armed with knife and replica gun tackled comedian during Netflix gig during

04:26.100 --> 04:29.700
set about how the woke brigade tried to cancel him over trans jokes.

04:29.700 --> 04:33.700
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for hip hop history.

04:41.700 --> 04:45.700
Thank God that was clumsy.

04:48.260 --> 04:55.700
He's back there getting stomped.

04:55.700 --> 04:59.700
Where did it come from?

04:59.700 --> 05:05.700
It was a it was a trans man.

05:05.700 --> 05:10.500
Was that Will Smith?

05:10.500 --> 05:15.420
This dude charged the fucking stage over Chappelle's trans jokes and then his security kick the

05:15.420 --> 05:16.420
shit out of him.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.580
Hey, you can't claim that Chappelle's transphobic.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.780
He just helped transition this guy into a pretzel.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.420
Look at his fucking arm, dude.

05:22.420 --> 05:26.860
He's being wheeled out of place on the stretcher and they just have his family guy ass twisted

05:26.860 --> 05:28.700
snapped arm locked into place.

05:28.700 --> 05:29.700
Holy shit.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.420
So the fellow who did it, it turns out he's actually a rapper.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.500
And on his soundcloud, he posted a song he called Dave Chappelle.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
No joke.

05:35.500 --> 05:40.500
Walk straight into the boat.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.500
You know, when they gave to me.

05:43.580 --> 05:47.100
Yeah, I don't know if you could tell through all that fucking mumbling, but he said walking

05:47.100 --> 05:50.960
straight into the bowl, referencing the Hollywood Bowl, the venue that Chappelle was performing

05:50.960 --> 05:52.220
in when the attack took place.

05:52.220 --> 05:56.020
And despite everybody seeing it, despite all the videos, despite his fucking arm and everything

05:56.020 --> 06:01.580
else, despite the rap song providing premeditation, he still pleaded not guilty.

06:01.580 --> 06:03.140
How in the fuck?

06:03.140 --> 06:07.100
And no, that wasn't the same person as this individual whose tweet of Dave Chappelle,

06:07.100 --> 06:11.780
you're next come from my trans homies again, and I swear to God went retroactively viral.

06:11.780 --> 06:12.780
Come on, guys.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.300
That doesn't even look like the attacker.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.100
I will say, though, scrolling through their feed makes me wish they were.

06:17.100 --> 06:21.260
This person is cancerous as fuck and can use a few years in jail just to be off Twitter.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.260
Here's the thing.

06:22.260 --> 06:25.940
Comedy was always meant to be the release valve for society where you could say edgy,

06:25.940 --> 06:26.940
even heinous shit.

06:26.940 --> 06:30.420
You could make gay jokes and black jokes and trans jokes and Holocaust jokes and whatever

06:30.420 --> 06:34.420
the fuck else you wanted, because part of recognizing and celebrating differences is

06:34.420 --> 06:37.340
banter between individuals with difference.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.780
Part of putting the past behind us is bantering about that past.

06:40.780 --> 06:43.940
And either you banter in a friendly manner or you fight as enemies.

06:43.940 --> 06:48.700
When a society cannot tell racist jokes as a method of normalizing difference, then they

06:48.700 --> 06:52.380
will commit racist acts out of ignorance of that difference.

06:52.380 --> 06:56.700
One of the greatest comedy shows of all time, what some even call the best there ever was,

06:56.700 --> 06:59.220
is Eddie Murphy's Delirious from 1983.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.500
And the jokes in it would make a Prague shit with rage if they ever went back and watched

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
it.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.740
Eddie Murphy has since disavowed it multiple times, most recently in 2019.

07:05.740 --> 07:09.160
It is funny, though, to see his disavowal from 1996.

07:09.160 --> 07:13.040
Just like the rest of the world, I am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in

07:13.040 --> 07:14.040
1981.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.080
I think it's unfair to take the words of a misinformed 21-year-old and apply them to

07:17.080 --> 07:18.860
an informed 35-year-old man.

07:18.860 --> 07:21.280
I know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.580
I know that AIDS isn't funny.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.400
It's 1996, and I'm a lot smarter about AIDS now.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.600
People were making its current year arguments 25 years ago, and although this is a statement

07:29.600 --> 07:34.340
with contents that any 2022 wokeoid would accept, it was made in 1996 using the same

07:34.340 --> 07:39.060
its current year logic during an era that Prague's nowadays view as being insufferably

07:39.060 --> 07:40.060
racist.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.940
Anyway, many people would say that Delirious was the height of comedy, and while there's

07:42.940 --> 07:45.940
since been great comedy, nothing has quite topped it.

07:45.940 --> 07:46.940
That's a common opinion.

07:46.940 --> 07:49.140
And yet it was raunchy, edgy, and even dark sometimes.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.300
It was not for the faint of heart.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.300
And that's okay.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.300
Does anybody remember Hannah Gadsby's Netflix comedy special Nanette?

07:54.300 --> 07:55.300
No?

07:55.300 --> 07:56.300
Nobody?

07:56.300 --> 07:57.300
Does anybody even know who she is?

07:57.300 --> 08:00.640
The only reason I know about her is because Nanette, despite getting high critic scores

08:00.640 --> 08:04.840
on Rotten Tomatoes, is considered god-fucking-awful, and you don't even need to go and watch

08:04.840 --> 08:05.840
it to know why.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.720
Lord knows I wouldn't subject you to that shit.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.760
Look at the synopsis of the specials we've discussed today.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.560
The closer begins with Dave Chappelle joking about COVID-19 and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.620
Sticks and Stones begins with Chappelle joking about some celebrity news.

08:16.620 --> 08:20.280
In Delirious, Eddie Murphy talks about kids who could afford ice cream from a passing

08:20.280 --> 08:22.960
ice cream truck, and how they would mock kids who couldn't afford it.

08:22.960 --> 08:27.280
In Nanette, Gadsby deconstructs the nature of comedy and its conventions by having her

08:27.280 --> 08:32.160
audience undergo the same tension in which marginalized people suffer on a daily basis.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.760
Oh boy, sign me up.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.660
It was clear to anybody with a brain that Nanette just sucked.

08:37.660 --> 08:42.880
But one part of the weekly Twitter news cycle back in like 2018 is how dumbfuck journalists

08:42.880 --> 08:44.120
kept trying to prop it up.

08:44.120 --> 08:48.880
Kind of like how recently they kept publishing pro-Cowboy Bebop live-action articles.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.040
Bill Maher's stand-up comedy's past, Hannah Gadsby represents its future.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.040
How?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.040
By being not funny?

08:54.040 --> 08:58.040
If you look at what both performers have served up as examples of their personal best, it's

08:58.040 --> 09:02.600
hard not to be embarrassed for Bill, as well as anyone else in comedy who feels more kinship

09:02.600 --> 09:04.660
with him than with somebody like Gadsby.

09:04.660 --> 09:08.860
The Tasmanian comics Nanette, which shifts from a typical joke-driven stand-up special

09:08.860 --> 09:12.900
into an explanation of why she's quitting comedy, delves into her personal biography

09:12.900 --> 09:17.120
as a lesbian woman struggling to express her authentic self as a student of visual art

09:17.120 --> 09:22.340
history, who scrutinized Western art painted mainly by straight white men that she unquestionably

09:22.340 --> 09:24.400
accepted as masters because of their reputation.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.900
Why would this make me embarrassed for Bill Maher?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.420
If anything, it makes me embarrassed for Hannah.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.700
People paid tickets for this shit, strapped themselves in for a night of fun, and turned

09:32.700 --> 09:34.620
around and got a demoralizing lecture.

09:34.620 --> 09:39.380
Of course, as the net continued to bomb, back in 2018 we kept seeing more articles pop up

09:39.380 --> 09:40.380
on the topic.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.820
How funny does comedy need to be?

09:41.820 --> 09:42.820
Eight signs.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.500
You're watching a post-comedy comedy.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.700
Post-comedy, by the way, is the deconstruction of comedy.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.780
In other words, it's not there to be funny, it's there to preach at you.

09:48.780 --> 09:49.780
You got suckered into it, chump.

09:49.780 --> 09:52.820
Now you gotta listen to this Karen tell you about how hard it is to be a lesbian in a

09:52.820 --> 09:53.820
first world country.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.820
Now some post-comedy can be a little bit funny, depending on your mood.

09:56.820 --> 10:00.700
I'm fine with extremely dark comedy, and some of those eight signs are absolutely part of

10:00.700 --> 10:01.700
dark comedy.

10:01.700 --> 10:06.780
Like the grim plot movers, real human bodies often in pain, and existential dread.

10:06.780 --> 10:10.080
And of course they have reversing expectations in there because fuck you, I guess.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.580
But post-comedy is kind of like dark chocolate.

10:12.580 --> 10:15.920
It's good in small amounts, but you can't have too much of it or else your heart will

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
die.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.900
I have to refer back to Antonio Gramsci once again.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.460
Seriously guys, read this man's writing.

10:20.460 --> 10:24.260
Gramsci's contribution to the communist movement was his theory of cultural hegemony.

10:24.260 --> 10:27.740
He believed that the bourgeoisie maintained capitalism not only through violence in the

10:27.740 --> 10:31.460
realm of politics and coercion in the realm of economics, but indoctrination in the realm

10:31.460 --> 10:32.460
of culture.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.740
The culture of a given nation was therefore a product of the ruling class, legitimizing

10:35.740 --> 10:39.780
their rule, such that values of the bourgeoisie became the common sense of the nation's working

10:39.780 --> 10:40.780
class.

10:40.780 --> 10:43.540
In other words, Gramsci believed that the normal values that a society is built upon

10:43.540 --> 10:47.140
that grew organically out of the traditions that were passed on through generations.

10:47.380 --> 10:51.020
Instead, he believed that it was an ideology enforced by the ruling class, taught by the

10:51.020 --> 10:53.260
ruling class, to benefit the ruling class.

10:53.260 --> 10:56.780
Gramsci therefore believed that a socialist revolution could only happen if the socialists

10:56.780 --> 11:00.840
created, propagated, and eventually enforced an alternative culture that would eventually

11:00.840 --> 11:03.440
become hegemonic and displace the old traditional one.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.420
The revolutionary working class, as the socialists envisioned them, could not only seize the

11:07.420 --> 11:10.820
means of production in an economic sense, nor could they only implement a dictatorship

11:10.820 --> 11:12.380
of the proletariat in a political sense.

11:12.380 --> 11:17.260
They also had to create a culture that would make people want to revolt and want to participate

11:17.260 --> 11:19.900
in these new structures after they had taken hold.

11:19.900 --> 11:23.940
Gramsci considered intellectuals to be the class that produced cultural hegemony.

11:23.940 --> 11:27.760
Schools by necessity indoctrinate youth into something, so Gramsci believed that they should

11:27.760 --> 11:31.720
indoctrinate them into socialism rather than capitalism or religiosity or any other kind

11:31.720 --> 11:32.720
of ideology.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.880
Entertainment, by necessity, has to appeal to some kind of value system, so Gramsci believed

11:36.880 --> 11:40.700
that it should appeal to socialist values over any other set of values.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.300
Hegemonicism, by necessity, had to report events with some kind of bias since nobody's

11:44.300 --> 11:47.780
truly neutral, so Gramsci believed that it should present events in a way that benefits

11:47.780 --> 11:48.780
socialism.

11:48.780 --> 11:52.940
Even though Gramsci would ultimately be killed by the Italian fascists, his theory of cultural

11:52.940 --> 11:56.940
hegemony was nearly identical to the fascists' totalizing worldview, and the theory would

11:56.940 --> 12:01.300
later be adopted by the Soviet Union for use both at home as well as abroad in their Active

12:01.300 --> 12:03.180
Measures Demoralization campaign.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.500
So the purpose of all of this is to create media that demoralizes you, that makes you

12:06.500 --> 12:09.620
hate yourself, your home, your friends and your family, your culture, your country, your

12:09.620 --> 12:10.620
civilization.

12:11.540 --> 12:12.980
There may even be good reasons for this hate too.

12:12.980 --> 12:16.240
None of these things are perfect, everyone's got flaws, and you certainly shouldn't just

12:16.240 --> 12:18.540
go on doing bad things because it's traditional.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.340
You shouldn't go on letting yourself be worse than you could be because you've always

12:21.340 --> 12:22.340
been this way.

12:22.340 --> 12:26.040
But demoralization isn't critique for the purpose of improvement, it's deconstruction

12:26.040 --> 12:27.380
for the purpose of replacement.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.680
It serves to make you hate yourself for your faults, to the point that you desperately

12:30.680 --> 12:34.940
wish to be somebody else, rather than strive to overcome those faults and become the best

12:34.940 --> 12:39.140
possible version of yourself that you can be, to benefit both you and those around you.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.100
This conversation is far beyond Dave Chappelle at this point.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.780
But I think this is what's at the center of all of this stuff.

12:43.780 --> 12:47.980
All the awful woke infiltration of media from movies to shows to games to comics that is

12:47.980 --> 12:50.680
preachy unlike anything we've seen in 50 years.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.700
And all the cancel culture shit for people who don't comply, who speak out against

12:53.700 --> 12:56.940
what they view as obvious political subversion, or hell, who don't even care about politics

12:56.940 --> 12:58.960
at all, they just think that what they're watching is bad.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.860
It all relates back to subversion and hegemony.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.580
The creation of an alternative culture to supplant the old one.

13:04.580 --> 13:09.000
A culture that will consider a socialist revolution to be a moral necessity, rather than the evil

13:09.000 --> 13:10.480
that it obviously is.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.960
People like Dave Chappelle are way more common than anybody realizes, due to the steady and

13:13.960 --> 13:16.320
slow establishment of this new hegemony.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.960
And thankfully, these people are also becoming more vocal as we slowly break away from this

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
new hegemony.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.440
If you're in this camp, you should also be more vocal in whatever small way you can

13:24.440 --> 13:25.440
too.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.060
The more we unshackle ourselves from this garbage, the more we're going to see attacks

13:28.060 --> 13:32.400
like this happen, I think, as people watch all of their subversive efforts over the past

13:32.400 --> 13:37.600
decade begin to crumble away, as liberalism and individualism begin to reassert itself,

13:37.600 --> 13:40.520
they're going to get more desperate, and there's probably going to be more political

13:40.520 --> 13:42.120
violence before it gets any better.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.760
Buckle up kids, it's going to be a wild ride.
