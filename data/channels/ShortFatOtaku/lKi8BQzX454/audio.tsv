0	9740	So recently, or at least recently for me, y'all know what kind of a slowpoke I am,
9740	13840	an audience member at a Dave Chappelle stand-up event bum-rushed the stage, hoping to attack
13840	14840	the comedian.
14840	18600	It didn't end well for him, but YouTube goes very hard on showing violence or saying
18600	21680	curse words during the first minute of any video, so I'm going to have to hold off
21680	23520	on actually describing that event for a little bit.
23520	26660	I don't know why that stuff is fine later on, maybe it's because YouTube's censors
26660	30360	only have time to watch the first minute before they lazily check the box saying it's
30360	31360	all good and move on?
31360	35060	Yes, I'm currently talking about you, Mr. YouTube Censor, who's got the unlucky job
35060	37600	of manually confirming my video from monetization today.
37600	38600	How are you doing?
38600	39600	Did you get enough coffee?
39600	40600	I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, dude.
40600	42600	I know what kind of videos you've got to confirm next.
42600	45220	Maybe now is the time to go back to school, you know, you've been putting it off for
45220	49420	like seven years, pursue that dream job, it's got to be better than being the corpo lap
49420	52060	dog for two bucks above minimum wage, you know?
52060	55540	Anyway, this all started with the Dave Chappelle Netflix controversy.
55540	58460	Netflix had paid Chappelle for six comedy specials.
58460	62540	The fifth one, called Sticks and Stones, came out in 2019 with a secret epilogue called
62540	63540	The Punch Line.
63540	67120	In it, Chappelle said that during one of his previous performances, he made jokes at the
67120	71640	expense of trans people and a trans woman in the audience, Daphne Dorman, laughed loudly
71640	74060	enough to actually disrupt the performance.
74060	78220	They ended up talking after the show, where Dorman thanked Chappelle for normalizing transgender
78220	80000	people by telling jokes about them.
80000	84300	This new friendship culminated with Dorman being the opening act for that very same Sticks
84300	85300	and Stones show.
86060	88880	Two years later, Chappelle's sixth comedy special, The Closer, came out.
88880	92820	In it, he described how, after Dorman's association with him, she received an extreme
92820	96380	amount of online harassment for defending Chappelle's comedy and associating with
96380	100180	him in any capacity, and that harassment eventually led to her suicide.
100180	105000	Yes, the trans activists, so concerned with ideological purity, so distrusting of the
105000	110640	subversive nature of comedy, and so very personally aware of the high suicide rates and fragile
110640	115220	mental states of trans people, bullied a trans woman to suicide because she associated with
115220	116240	their political enemy.
116240	120380	This is why, when these people shriek, trans rights, trans lives matter, you're literally
120380	124300	killing trans people, I just don't care anymore.
124300	125480	Because they don't care.
125480	127400	They don't hold these things as values.
127400	132520	They have no problem violating trans rights, devaluing trans lives, and leaving trans corpses
132520	135500	in their wake as long as they're the ones doing it.
135500	138740	Political transness claims dominion over the trans individual.
138740	142600	She is theirs to let live and theirs to kill as it suits their interest.
142600	146400	If she dies without their consent, then the enemy may have killed a person, but more importantly
146400	148880	to them, the enemy has stolen from the ideology.
148880	154360	Oh, and by the way, political blackness interacts with Black Lives Matter in the same way.
154360	157120	Hey, Mr. YouTube Censor, if you're still here, don't worry.
157120	159280	I understand why I'm not getting any money for this one.
159280	160280	I don't take it personally.
160280	161280	You're just doing your job.
161280	162280	I'm still correct though.
162280	165540	In any case, I found myself at the point where I just don't care if the mainstream calls
165540	166540	Dave Chappelle transphobic.
166540	167540	I don't believe he's transphobic.
167540	171120	I believe that they are more transphobic than he is, in fact, despite his jokes, because
171120	173880	unlike them, jokes are all he's got on his hands.
173880	174880	Like, listen to this.
174880	176940	This is a clip from that Netflix walkout.
176940	178880	We need to say it's not okay.
178880	181120	This hate conversation was not their intention.
181120	184960	We understand that jokes are jokes, things are things, but at the end of the day, if
184960	189640	it's promoting hate and it's promoting discrimination, you are directly a cause of it if you're allowing
189640	191780	it to happen and you're not doing anything about it.
191780	196240	And that goes for anyone in this country, specifically people of power in the entertainment
196240	197240	industry.
197240	198780	It's that same totalizing.
198780	199780	Everything is political.
199780	202320	Everything must exist outside of our hegemony worldview.
202320	205680	That walkout ended up going nowhere though, even though it was highly publicized.
205680	208200	And when it came out, the people were fired over this whole shit show.
208200	209860	It wasn't necessarily because they walked out.
209860	212740	It was because they burst into a board meeting demanding to be heard.
212740	217220	And it was because they leaked Netflix's private information on the closer to the press and
217220	218220	protest.
218220	220920	By the end of all of this, Chappelle came out of it smelling like roses.
220920	221920	He wasn't canceled.
221920	225260	And I genuinely think that we've now reached the hump, the limits of woke overreach.
225260	226340	We're cresting the wave.
226340	227420	Chappelle got through it.
227420	228980	Elon Musk got through it and won.
228980	232660	And it turns out he's actually a secret 2016 year anti-SJW bro.
232660	236780	Other people who would have been canceled two years ago nowadays just say fuck off and
236780	237780	ignore it.
237780	241820	Nobody is phased anymore by being baselessly called racist or fascist or whatever else.
241820	247240	Every wokeoid tactic is failing right in front of everybody's eyes, in public, live on display.
247240	252400	The culture is slowly but finally breaking free of the shackles the left has put on it.
252400	257140	And of course, some people are naturally enraged by this series of events, which is where that
257140	258260	attack on Dave Chappelle comes in.
258700	261700	A 23 year old is charged with trying to attack Dave Chappelle.
261700	266100	Attacker armed with knife and replica gun tackled comedian during Netflix gig during
266100	269700	set about how the woke brigade tried to cancel him over trans jokes.
269700	273700	Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for hip hop history.
281700	285700	Thank God that was clumsy.
288260	295700	He's back there getting stomped.
295700	299700	Where did it come from?
299700	305700	It was a it was a trans man.
305700	310500	Was that Will Smith?
310500	315420	This dude charged the fucking stage over Chappelle's trans jokes and then his security kick the
315420	316420	shit out of him.
316580	318580	Hey, you can't claim that Chappelle's transphobic.
318580	320780	He just helped transition this guy into a pretzel.
320780	322420	Look at his fucking arm, dude.
322420	326860	He's being wheeled out of place on the stretcher and they just have his family guy ass twisted
326860	328700	snapped arm locked into place.
328700	329700	Holy shit.
329700	331420	So the fellow who did it, it turns out he's actually a rapper.
331420	334500	And on his soundcloud, he posted a song he called Dave Chappelle.
334500	335500	No joke.
335500	340500	Walk straight into the boat.
340500	343500	You know, when they gave to me.
343580	347100	Yeah, I don't know if you could tell through all that fucking mumbling, but he said walking
347100	350960	straight into the bowl, referencing the Hollywood Bowl, the venue that Chappelle was performing
350960	352220	in when the attack took place.
352220	356020	And despite everybody seeing it, despite all the videos, despite his fucking arm and everything
356020	361580	else, despite the rap song providing premeditation, he still pleaded not guilty.
361580	363140	How in the fuck?
363140	367100	And no, that wasn't the same person as this individual whose tweet of Dave Chappelle,
367100	371780	you're next come from my trans homies again, and I swear to God went retroactively viral.
371780	372780	Come on, guys.
373060	374300	That doesn't even look like the attacker.
374300	377100	I will say, though, scrolling through their feed makes me wish they were.
377100	381260	This person is cancerous as fuck and can use a few years in jail just to be off Twitter.
381260	382260	Here's the thing.
382260	385940	Comedy was always meant to be the release valve for society where you could say edgy,
385940	386940	even heinous shit.
386940	390420	You could make gay jokes and black jokes and trans jokes and Holocaust jokes and whatever
390420	394420	the fuck else you wanted, because part of recognizing and celebrating differences is
394420	397340	banter between individuals with difference.
397340	400780	Part of putting the past behind us is bantering about that past.
400780	403940	And either you banter in a friendly manner or you fight as enemies.
403940	408700	When a society cannot tell racist jokes as a method of normalizing difference, then they
408700	412380	will commit racist acts out of ignorance of that difference.
412380	416700	One of the greatest comedy shows of all time, what some even call the best there ever was,
416700	419220	is Eddie Murphy's Delirious from 1983.
419220	422500	And the jokes in it would make a Prague shit with rage if they ever went back and watched
422500	423500	it.
423500	425740	Eddie Murphy has since disavowed it multiple times, most recently in 2019.
425740	429160	It is funny, though, to see his disavowal from 1996.
429160	433040	Just like the rest of the world, I am more educated about AIDS in 1996 than I was in
433040	434040	1981.
434040	437080	I think it's unfair to take the words of a misinformed 21-year-old and apply them to
437080	438860	an informed 35-year-old man.
438860	441280	I know how serious an issue AIDS is the world over.
441280	442580	I know that AIDS isn't funny.
442580	445400	It's 1996, and I'm a lot smarter about AIDS now.
445400	449600	People were making its current year arguments 25 years ago, and although this is a statement
449600	454340	with contents that any 2022 wokeoid would accept, it was made in 1996 using the same
454340	459060	its current year logic during an era that Prague's nowadays view as being insufferably
459060	460060	racist.
460060	462940	Anyway, many people would say that Delirious was the height of comedy, and while there's
462940	465940	since been great comedy, nothing has quite topped it.
465940	466940	That's a common opinion.
466940	469140	And yet it was raunchy, edgy, and even dark sometimes.
469140	470300	It was not for the faint of heart.
470300	471300	And that's okay.
471300	474300	Does anybody remember Hannah Gadsby's Netflix comedy special Nanette?
474300	475300	No?
475300	476300	Nobody?
476300	477300	Does anybody even know who she is?
477300	480640	The only reason I know about her is because Nanette, despite getting high critic scores
480640	484840	on Rotten Tomatoes, is considered god-fucking-awful, and you don't even need to go and watch
484840	485840	it to know why.
485840	487720	Lord knows I wouldn't subject you to that shit.
487720	489760	Look at the synopsis of the specials we've discussed today.
489760	493560	The closer begins with Dave Chappelle joking about COVID-19 and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
493560	496620	Sticks and Stones begins with Chappelle joking about some celebrity news.
496620	500280	In Delirious, Eddie Murphy talks about kids who could afford ice cream from a passing
500280	502960	ice cream truck, and how they would mock kids who couldn't afford it.
502960	507280	In Nanette, Gadsby deconstructs the nature of comedy and its conventions by having her
507280	512160	audience undergo the same tension in which marginalized people suffer on a daily basis.
512160	514760	Oh boy, sign me up.
514760	517660	It was clear to anybody with a brain that Nanette just sucked.
517660	522880	But one part of the weekly Twitter news cycle back in like 2018 is how dumbfuck journalists
522880	524120	kept trying to prop it up.
524120	528880	Kind of like how recently they kept publishing pro-Cowboy Bebop live-action articles.
528880	532040	Bill Maher's stand-up comedy's past, Hannah Gadsby represents its future.
532040	533040	How?
533040	534040	By being not funny?
534040	538040	If you look at what both performers have served up as examples of their personal best, it's
538040	542600	hard not to be embarrassed for Bill, as well as anyone else in comedy who feels more kinship
542600	544660	with him than with somebody like Gadsby.
544660	548860	The Tasmanian comics Nanette, which shifts from a typical joke-driven stand-up special
548860	552900	into an explanation of why she's quitting comedy, delves into her personal biography
552900	557120	as a lesbian woman struggling to express her authentic self as a student of visual art
557120	562340	history, who scrutinized Western art painted mainly by straight white men that she unquestionably
562340	564400	accepted as masters because of their reputation.
564400	566900	Why would this make me embarrassed for Bill Maher?
566900	569420	If anything, it makes me embarrassed for Hannah.
569420	572700	People paid tickets for this shit, strapped themselves in for a night of fun, and turned
572700	574620	around and got a demoralizing lecture.
574620	579380	Of course, as the net continued to bomb, back in 2018 we kept seeing more articles pop up
579380	580380	on the topic.
580380	581820	How funny does comedy need to be?
581820	582820	Eight signs.
582820	584500	You're watching a post-comedy comedy.
584500	586700	Post-comedy, by the way, is the deconstruction of comedy.
586700	588780	In other words, it's not there to be funny, it's there to preach at you.
588780	589780	You got suckered into it, chump.
589780	592820	Now you gotta listen to this Karen tell you about how hard it is to be a lesbian in a
592820	593820	first world country.
593820	596820	Now some post-comedy can be a little bit funny, depending on your mood.
596820	600700	I'm fine with extremely dark comedy, and some of those eight signs are absolutely part of
600700	601700	dark comedy.
601700	606780	Like the grim plot movers, real human bodies often in pain, and existential dread.
606780	610080	And of course they have reversing expectations in there because fuck you, I guess.
610080	612580	But post-comedy is kind of like dark chocolate.
612580	615920	It's good in small amounts, but you can't have too much of it or else your heart will
615920	616920	die.
616920	618900	I have to refer back to Antonio Gramsci once again.
618900	620460	Seriously guys, read this man's writing.
620460	624260	Gramsci's contribution to the communist movement was his theory of cultural hegemony.
624260	627740	He believed that the bourgeoisie maintained capitalism not only through violence in the
627740	631460	realm of politics and coercion in the realm of economics, but indoctrination in the realm
631460	632460	of culture.
632460	635740	The culture of a given nation was therefore a product of the ruling class, legitimizing
635740	639780	their rule, such that values of the bourgeoisie became the common sense of the nation's working
639780	640780	class.
640780	643540	In other words, Gramsci believed that the normal values that a society is built upon
643540	647140	that grew organically out of the traditions that were passed on through generations.
647380	651020	Instead, he believed that it was an ideology enforced by the ruling class, taught by the
651020	653260	ruling class, to benefit the ruling class.
653260	656780	Gramsci therefore believed that a socialist revolution could only happen if the socialists
656780	660840	created, propagated, and eventually enforced an alternative culture that would eventually
660840	663440	become hegemonic and displace the old traditional one.
663440	667420	The revolutionary working class, as the socialists envisioned them, could not only seize the
667420	670820	means of production in an economic sense, nor could they only implement a dictatorship
670820	672380	of the proletariat in a political sense.
672380	677260	They also had to create a culture that would make people want to revolt and want to participate
677260	679900	in these new structures after they had taken hold.
679900	683940	Gramsci considered intellectuals to be the class that produced cultural hegemony.
683940	687760	Schools by necessity indoctrinate youth into something, so Gramsci believed that they should
687760	691720	indoctrinate them into socialism rather than capitalism or religiosity or any other kind
691720	692720	of ideology.
692720	696880	Entertainment, by necessity, has to appeal to some kind of value system, so Gramsci believed
696880	700700	that it should appeal to socialist values over any other set of values.
700700	704300	Hegemonicism, by necessity, had to report events with some kind of bias since nobody's
704300	707780	truly neutral, so Gramsci believed that it should present events in a way that benefits
707780	708780	socialism.
708780	712940	Even though Gramsci would ultimately be killed by the Italian fascists, his theory of cultural
712940	716940	hegemony was nearly identical to the fascists' totalizing worldview, and the theory would
716940	721300	later be adopted by the Soviet Union for use both at home as well as abroad in their Active
721300	723180	Measures Demoralization campaign.
723180	726500	So the purpose of all of this is to create media that demoralizes you, that makes you
726500	729620	hate yourself, your home, your friends and your family, your culture, your country, your
729620	730620	civilization.
731540	732980	There may even be good reasons for this hate too.
732980	736240	None of these things are perfect, everyone's got flaws, and you certainly shouldn't just
736240	738540	go on doing bad things because it's traditional.
738540	741340	You shouldn't go on letting yourself be worse than you could be because you've always
741340	742340	been this way.
742340	746040	But demoralization isn't critique for the purpose of improvement, it's deconstruction
746040	747380	for the purpose of replacement.
747380	750680	It serves to make you hate yourself for your faults, to the point that you desperately
750680	754940	wish to be somebody else, rather than strive to overcome those faults and become the best
754940	759140	possible version of yourself that you can be, to benefit both you and those around you.
759180	761100	This conversation is far beyond Dave Chappelle at this point.
761100	763780	But I think this is what's at the center of all of this stuff.
763780	767980	All the awful woke infiltration of media from movies to shows to games to comics that is
767980	770680	preachy unlike anything we've seen in 50 years.
770680	773700	And all the cancel culture shit for people who don't comply, who speak out against
773700	776940	what they view as obvious political subversion, or hell, who don't even care about politics
776940	778960	at all, they just think that what they're watching is bad.
778960	781860	It all relates back to subversion and hegemony.
781860	784580	The creation of an alternative culture to supplant the old one.
784580	789000	A culture that will consider a socialist revolution to be a moral necessity, rather than the evil
789000	790480	that it obviously is.
790480	793960	People like Dave Chappelle are way more common than anybody realizes, due to the steady and
