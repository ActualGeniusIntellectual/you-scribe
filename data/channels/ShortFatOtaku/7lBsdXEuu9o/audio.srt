7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:58,880
account now too don't tell anyone oh really yeah it's it's called morbius devo oh i'm new do we

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,760
know him yes this is uh sfo you recently watched my um three forms of fascism video yeah a few

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,680
weeks ago right well i was still sick and you were sick i was sick yeah i was just sick for a really

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,520
long time yeah it was a really good video i really like that oh well thank you yeah i think um it's

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,440
interesting because whenever i talk to people on the left who are always mad at me about who i

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:32,960
talk to about like um like for example if i'm talking to like far right people they never seem

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,440
the people who criticize me on the left or even libs never seem to fully understand what they're

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,480
criticizing like they don't know the basics of that sphere and then they think that they have the

15
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,680
knowledge to like debate me on whether i should be talking to them or not if they don't even know

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,520
that it's not even called the alt-right anymore like like this is years old information like

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,840
and people are are so like just out of touch and they still think like richard spencer's around or

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,720
something yeah he's still relevant and stuff no he i mean look he's still doing whatever i don't

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,560
know what the fuck he's doing but he's doing something with his friend but nobody listens

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:24,000
to him anymore you know yeah yeah yeah fuck no i think things have changed you know since since

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,920
2016 since politics really blew up online things have kind of gone through several waves you know

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,760
we had like the alt-right they were doing their thing for a while then bread tube but now bread

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:42,240
tubes kind of gone like no one watches them anymore yeah i don't even yeah i i don't know

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,760
what happened to bread tube but somebody called me a breadtuber the other day and i

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,000
i don't know it was weird that a few times actually yeah yeah well there's a thing right

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,040
now because the right also doesn't understand the left online either so yeah you know sargon

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,320
you know sargon and i were good friends we talk every day but he has he has taken to calling

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:08,640
everyone who's not as right wing as him a communist and i'm just like well no i've heard

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,760
his logic and i can explain his logic and the logic is basically that the promises of liberalism

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,920
always go ultimately unfulfilled by liberalism so liberalism always degenerates into communism

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,680
so if you're a liberal it's only a matter of time that sounds like a mixed vivian wolf argument

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,840
honestly uh like the opposite of one like oh liberals always turn into fascists because they

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,880
always help fascists or something yes yeah and they both kind of think that of of each other i've

34
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,840
noticed that so if you were to actually search like hold on let me just give me give me a second here

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,200
all right if you search like the the phrase the promises of liberalism right you will see a lot

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,120
you'll find articles and and um and papers and all these things basically about how the liberals

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,600
promised under the french revolution they promised um liberty equality and fraternity and the

38
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,160
socialists believe they haven't actually brought any of those values into into politics but

39
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,200
socialism well socialism promises more liberty and more equality and more fraternity does does

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,520
socialism on paper i don't even know if on paper it does but okay yeah so on paper it's like in

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,840
reality it does not it cannot actually achieve these things but on paper though i mean you hear

42
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
this all the time right if you're talking to some breadtuber they'll say listen you like democracy

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
right stardust well we just want to expand democracy we're expanding it into the workplace

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,640
so they're appealing to this idea that the promises of liberalism have failed

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,000
and so sargon who has read a lot of the far left stuff he's like oh i guess they're correct so if

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,040
you're a liberal you're always going to generate into a communist so sargon is now a conservative

47
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,960
and that's his logic for it it's like well all right wow so so he and like i'm i'm still good

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,480
friends with him but he and i we have like arguments all the time i enjoy the arguments

49
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,760
they're fun because we can still be friends even though we disagree right yeah but um you know he's

50
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,680
he's off doing his his lotus eaters thing and it seems you're working out well for him he's got a

51
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
couple hundred thousand subs he's built a few new channels like he's doing okay he has like an

52
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,040
office and a staff like a dozen people like he's doing that's based yeah good for him yeah so he's

53
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,920
still he's still doing okay um i expected well i guess i understand his argument but i guess i

54
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:49,280
just would have expected some more nuance from him but yeah he so he's been doing a lot of reading

55
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,440
hey tidge how's it going he's been tidge is like the resident femboy of my community

56
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
what up femboy sorry i should probably call you by your name what up tidge

57
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,720
all right sargon's are doing a lot of reading oh yeah honestly a lot of the same reading that

58
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,720
i did for the fascism video just to understand some of this stuff you know yeah and a lot of

59
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,200
it has led him down a traditionalist rabbit hole interesting and also i think a lot of that is just

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,560
the fact that he's uh he's a dad now you know people tend to become more conservative when

61
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,320
they have parent when they have kids yeah just like a normal trend you know i don't blame him

62
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
um there was one thing i noticed i was watching your obama video

63
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,480
he talked about the nancy pelosi husband hammer attacker right it was just a few days ago that

64
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,120
a friend of mine paul pelosi was attacked in his own home somebody breaks into his house looking

65
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,000
for his wife nancy the speaker of the house and thankfully he's he's back home now and we're

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,880
going to let investigators do their jobs but but here's what's clear pittsburgh

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,960
this habit we've had we have of demonizing political opponents of saying crazy stuff

68
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,760
it creates a dangerous climate and and when you have people who are in leadership positions

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,080
who promote or ignore over the top rhetoric and then when there's an attack like this they make

70
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,560
light of it they joke about it then more people are going to get hurt

71
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,120
and more than that we violate the basic spirit of our democracy the spirit of who we are as

72
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,200
americans and how like people on on the right are kind of making fun of it or they're saying that

73
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,160
you know it might have been like a guy who was trying to have sex with him and then it went awry

74
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,600
and like there's all these things going on with that story and we don't know what's going on yet

75
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,560
um he seems to be correct i mean i don't expect obama to necessarily be bipartisan he's clearly

76
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,960
a democrat right but like did you hear about the shooting of the republican candidate a couple days

77
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,400
ago no i did not yeah so this is yeah let me just pull it out real quick i i talked about it this

78
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,040
morning on the weekly sip do i still have it um yeah republican congressional candidate candidates

79
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,840
pat herrington's house was shot up and his children were inside holy shit he's running against

80
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,720
democrat jeff jackson and yeah they're okay he's running against democrat jeff jackson in district

81
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
14 the fbi is investigating let's see if i can find an article so you don't just have to take my

82
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:38,320
word for it which state is this again uh let me see let me see let me see uh pat herrington is

83
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:48,400
the name uh harrigan sorry north carolina okay here here's the ap news article so one thing i've

84
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,760
noticed is that the right wing of the internet is talking about this like 24 7 right now okay

85
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,560
they're talking about how there's some deranged leftoid who's going around shooting up uh

86
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,360
republican candidates who are running for office and how this is ridiculous and the left has gone

87
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,800
too far and this is too much meanwhile at the same time you ignore on the left on the left

88
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,720
side of the internet's talking about this but no one on the right is talking about any violence

89
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,920
that their guys commit you know like we we've reached this point in politics where it seems like

90
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,960
it seems like both sides are just willing to point the finger at their opponents but ignore it when

91
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:40,320
their side does it you know what i mean yeah okay i could see that um yeah do they know who did the

92
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,400
shooting not yet the fbi is still investigating this is like two days old this is two days old

93
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,640
damn i know you watched another one of my videos where i went over just like a lot of the stuff

94
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,120
that like a lot of people who were just regular republican voters who were getting harassed over

95
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
the course like like that i know i know you watched the video and you like exclaimed a lot

96
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,320
of shock at the one guy who got his like eye socket broken um yeah where he like he was like

97
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,920
an asian guy in new york he just like wore a mega hat around and then a bunch of people just kicked

98
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,480
the shit out of them you know and you don't see that reported on so i i think i think we've

99
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,920
reached this point in at least american politics where both sides are existing in a completely

100
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,240
different news bubble and they're only seeing the stuff that makes them look like victims and makes

101
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,320
their political opponents look like basically nazis and that's a pretty dangerous place to be

102
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
in because no one people aren't talking the same language anymore yeah that is dangerous that's

103
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,680
very dangerous um it's interesting there's that you say like victim and like then the other side

104
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:52,240
is the aggressor um and i find that that like repeating in a lot of different um spheres online

105
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,680
and in person where um there's like this paint i don't know what it is but it seems like everybody

106
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,120
right now is kind of like bent on painting themselves as victims of uh of someone or you

107
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,120
know whatever like i don't know it just seems it seems like people are very obsessed with the whole

108
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:20,160
victimhood thing yeah yeah so there's there's a paper that was written maybe in 2009 it was a

109
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,600
philosophy paper i know sargon showed it to me i know that taftaj has read it but i forget the

110
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,360
name of the guy i can tell you the ideas but i forget the name of the guy who wrote it but he

111
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:37,360
basically said that all of politics and all of morality does ultimately come down to justifying

112
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,640
victimhood and how every political camp behaves in the exact same way they just have different

113
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,720
targets and his argument was basically that if you look at fascists right the fascists they

114
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,560
always claim to be victims of something you know there there's some group out there that is

115
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,960
oppressing them it can be the jews or it can be the blacks or it can be it could be race mixers

116
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,560
it can be it can be marxists or liberals or whoever but there's a group out there that's

117
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,720
oppressing them and they're doing things to them that violate their nazi code of ethics

118
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,360
and so they are they're victims and they're justified in oppressing them back

119
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,520
and from the nazi point of view they're correct because the nazis happen to have an ethical code

120
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,600
that they follow and the liberals necessarily have to oppress them so they are actually victims

121
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,400
and the socialists say the same thing the socialists always say well we're victims of

122
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,080
the capitalist system and and of the and of a you know like a you know the bourgeois and whoever

123
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,240
right and from their point of view they're also correct so they because they have defined what

124
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,960
aggression is as capitalist action if you know if you own property that's aggression right

125
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,200
things like that and then if you look at the liberals liberals do the same thing because

126
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,920
the liberals will say well we only oppress people who are censors or who who do oppressing first

127
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,960
but that's still ultimately oppressing the liberal political opponents because it's only the

128
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:10,160
liberals who value non-aggression who or who values self-defense as its own virtue so like

129
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,360
whenever when when people say there was a debate it was destiny versus a muslim guy

130
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,040
like last year or something and the muslim guy basically said well we like the liberals are

131
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,080
oppressing us and the destiny said well how are the liberals oppressing you it's like well they

132
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:31,280
won't let us right sorry who do you know his name yeah i think it's daniel hikikichu it might be i

133
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,040
don't remember his name but he said that he basically said that the liberals are preventing

134
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,360
us from applying sharia law and it's like well isn't sharia law oppressive and he's like not

135
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,440
to us it isn't because every political camp defines what constitutes aggression and what

136
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,080
constitutes oppression in in basically in their in their own favor and so after they've created

137
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,880
that normativity they can then go after their political opponents for violating the normativity

138
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,560
so liberals and socialists and fascists they all behave in the same way in the end they just have

139
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,440
different targets and it really just boils down to well what targets do you find do you think are

140
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,640
morally acceptable to go after and as soon as you realize that's what politics is everything becomes

141
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,320
very scary you know what i mean yeah because now now it's much harder to actually negotiate

142
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,120
anything and i think that's that's like the road that we've all gone down recently is that no one's

143
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,960
negotiating anymore no one's listening to each other anymore yeah um yeah no it does it seems

144
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,280
like even like 10 years ago um politics used to be like way more bipartisan i'm not really sure

145
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,480
if it's like social media and algorithms that's made people more siloed or what um

146
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,680
but i mean part of that yeah yeah it's part of it but i think there are some sacrifices that we do

147
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,480
need to to make right like if liberalism is oppressive to towards people who want to

148
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,800
practice sharia law unfortunately we are going by like what the majority wants here

149
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,400
the majority does not want sharia law the majority um would not um be okay with sharia law

150
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,640
uh so i mean at a certain point we like yeah it may be oppressive in some sort of way to you but

151
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:29,120
um i would say it is justified i guess sure but but then all that means is that if you ever lose

152
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,040
the majority then you're you're automatically wrong right so for example if you go to a muslim

153
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,280
majority country and you're relying on on that sentiment to to basically guide your morality

154
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,000
well now suddenly it's moral to to oppress gay people if you live in a muslim majority country

155
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,440
so that also has its own pitfalls that that's why you know i was we were both i know you were

156
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,480
on the call and i was listening to the call yeah of um over on destiny's channel earlier about the

157
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,360
whole like anti-democracy arc or whatever and like there's a decent argument there's actually

158
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,120
a few solid decent arguments to be to just strictly being anti-democracy and i think like

159
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,520
the you know do you want to live in a country where the majority of people want to oppress you

160
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,880
that's a pretty good one right there right like if you're if you're gay living in saudi arabia

161
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,520
it is the democratic will of the people that you be thrown off the building and it's like well

162
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,560
that's no good you know there there's there has to be some some kind of virtue system that is

163
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,480
above democracy i think which is a very strange way to put it because i'm still a liberal but

164
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,360
you know what i mean yeah there's something going on here um okay

165
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,040
i mean i i don't know i feel i i guess what i would hope for if i were living in one of

166
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,280
those countries is that over time you know culture would change and that through the culture changing

167
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:03,280
um people would enact change in their government and things like that but uh yeah if if everybody

168
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:12,080
if if i guess if a majority of the population occupies a place and it's like an actual democracy

169
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,400
and majority that population believes in things that are going to be oppressive very oppressive

170
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,840
to specific groups then i guess you yeah you have a point um and to be fair that is the world we

171
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,760
live in now yeah you know because because we do oppress non-liberals in liberal countries you know

172
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,240
we don't let the socialists you know have their violent revolution here we have to oppress them

173
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,120
someone's always getting oppressed yeah that's that's just the nature of politics right yeah

174
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,800
i guess so yeah i guess i would just say it's justified but then whether

175
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,960
i i would say it's justified that um that they are getting oppressed in some sort of way but

176
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,760
if it were the opposite like you're saying um in a different country where

177
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,920
the majority wants to throw somebody off a building um i i don't know that i i would

178
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,720
necessarily say that it's justified to throw them off the building but i would just say it's

179
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,360
justified for them to enact that because the majority voted that way i guess maybe i don't

180
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,840
know yeah that's where we get to the part that like democracy can be just as oppressive as any

181
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,040
kind of dictatorship in the end where it all depends on on what the power is used for right

182
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,080
so sure sure yeah it can be um it can be but i think there's less i think there's more

183
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,200
opportunities for it to not be oppressive i guess oh sure like here's the thing i'm still

184
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,520
ultimately pro-democracy i just know the anti-democracy argument very well like like

185
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,440
for example the um i don't know if you've made it public where you live do you are you in california

186
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,640
or la i'm not no okay but you know but you know about the um the urban sprawl problem there right

187
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,440
how it's just like hundreds of miles of houses yeah it sucks yeah yeah so that's a problem

188
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,560
that's uh that's unique to democracy actually because if you have you know you have a

189
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,400
neighborhood where everyone where there's a bunch of small landowners right and well what's what's

190
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,600
what would be good for that neighborhood is if you build an apartment block because if you build

191
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,120
an apartment block that those are going to be cheaper places to rent that poor people can go

192
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,520
live in and then now suddenly demand for all that housing goes way down but and so now people can

193
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,040
actually buy houses and own houses the middle class can actually have houses again like they

194
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,400
could 50 years ago but the problem with that is that that also means that um the property values

195
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:47,040
go down and every single person who owns property in la is never ever ever going to vote for a

196
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,240
zoning reform that will allow giant apartment blocks to be built because it actually hurts

197
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,760
their own bottom line so this is an instance where every single voter will always vote in

198
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,920
their own interest but that interest destroys society and so so like nimbyism itself is is

199
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,600
a problem unique to democracy right um it's the same thing with like prison reform nobody likes

200
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,120
how american prisons are but no one ever actually votes to change them and no one ever wants a

201
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
prison built in their backyard no one ever wants prisoners to be released into their community you

202
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,920
know so so nimbyism like if you had a let's say a a benevolent philosopher king he would just build

203
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:34,240
the apartment block and he would just build the prison as the society needed it you know and uh

204
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,960
i don't know i feel like nimbyism is one of those things that would be changed even through

205
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,440
democracy like i think that there are enough people that that it's plausible that there are

206
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,640
enough people eventually who would want um who would be willing to make that sacrifice in their

207
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:57,280
in their home like their property value going down uh just to fix the um the problem of people

208
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,880
not having enough places to live uh like is that maybe we haven't seen it yet though you know

209
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,000
i mean there's a little bit of a movement right like there's a little bit of a movement kind of

210
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,080
starting up around it maybe maybe it might happen but i don't know like it's that's a tough one i

211
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:23,680
mean another like if here do you do you want the ultimate black pill sure okay so when when trump

212
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,600
was refusing to concede the election right yeah who was it who was it on the right that was

213
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:45,360
actually standing up to trump uh pence um um pence did a little bit yeah and and to his credit

214
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:54,080
to his credit but every single republican politician who who basically had their jobs

215
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,840
on the line because they were being voted in and they knew how um how popular trump was they

216
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,600
didn't say a single thing it was it was republican judges that looked into the cases and said no

217
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,160
these have no merit it was um the attorney general whose position was appointed not elected you know

218
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,000
it was the head of the fbi these are all positions that they don't need to worry about um public

219
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,520
popularity and they were the ones that had the political space to oppose trump from the right

220
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,600
and ultimately it was those guys who did their part in saving democracy the all the ones who

221
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,920
who were in like unsafe seats and who had to get re-elected they didn't say a single thing

222
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,920
you know yeah the ultimate black pill is that it was the anti-democratic elements of

223
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,920
the american republic that saved democracy interesting

224
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:55,600
and so i i think that's why like america has both democratic and autocratic elements because because

225
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,000
you need both of them in some sense you need you need a component of your government that

226
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,360
is outside the democratic process in order to be able to accurately judge it

227
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,160
okay that makes sense couch man in the in the chat's been converted he now loves authoritarianism

228
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,200
based nice

229
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,680
yeah i guess that i guess i guess that's true yeah it was it was the

230
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,640
okay that's that's interesting i feel like my brain isn't big enough for this but i think

231
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,920
i'm getting what you're saying here i'll give you one final one final black pill hold on let me find

232
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:38,560
this let me just pull this up real quick isn't something else taftage has sent me she's got a big

233
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,800
brain she knows what's going on oh yeah she does yeah you've spoken to her before

234
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,920
uh yeah yeah i have i like her a lot yeah it's funny like as soon as she went on destiny that

235
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,040
first time i messaged her and i was like oh yeah you know you seem really cool and and then she

236
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,040
like immediately follows me back on twitter and then fangirls out because apparently she's been

237
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:08,800
watching me for years and i was like oh okay that's so base okay i'll i'll pull i'll give you

238
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,800
this study here from cambridge testing theories of american politics elites interest groups and

239
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:23,520
average citizens um so the tldr of this study is let me just let me just find that tldr the tldr

240
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,960
the study is basically it's basically that the statistical correlation between

241
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,400
how much money you make and whether or not the policies that you vote for actually get implemented

242
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,880
goes up the more money you make and so when you have when you're in the lowest income bracket in

243
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,240
the united states who you vote for basically doesn't matter and as your income goes up

244
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,960
the more likely it is that the policies you want and that you vote for end up coming true

245
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,040
which is a very interesting way to look at democracy is that you know if you if you are

246
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,160
a very poor person and you vote for a candidate because he says he's going to do xyz the chances

247
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:18,400
of him doing xyz is actually very low yeah okay there are ways to change that though right like

248
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:27,520
from a local advocacy point right like a i don't know like you're right this study is right sure

249
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:34,560
um i guess um i don't know what i'm getting at here i have no idea what i'm saying

250
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:43,760
take the authoritarian pill stardust i don't think i i don't think i can just yeah but um i don't

251
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,720
know god become god emperor trump and or biden whoever you want it's got to be a god emperor

252
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,320
though i don't mind being god emperor you know but i just feel like i i still strongly believe

253
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,040
in and advocating for people to get out and vote because because yeah the the i mean the less you

254
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,720
vote the less it really does matter i guess like it i don't know i feel like it takes it takes two

255
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,640
to tango right like we you can't expect um you can't expect your your hopes to be fulfilled when

256
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,080
you can't even elect the people that want to um to help you achieve that goal yeah see so like

257
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,040
at the end of it i'm still pro-democracy right i'm just i'm not i am i am kind of larping here i

258
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,040
understand the other point of view but i am pro-democracy democracy you know it's just that i

259
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,840
understand that democracy it can't be the the ultimate value it can't be the highest political

260
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,880
value it has to be only a part of your political process sure what do you think the other values

261
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,480
are oh well in the united states it's the constitution right the constitution the whole

262
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,120
point of the constitution is that these are things that even if the population votes for them the

263
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:00,320
government cannot do and so if you have that limit on democracy then you can at least rein in the

264
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,840
excesses of the tyranny of the majority that's the that's the reason that your republic is set

265
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,680
up the way that it is okay and you know there's there's it's more on the left than on the right

266
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,480
because on the right you at least have the libertarians on the left they just do not give

267
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,160
a shit about the constitution they're like any institution that stands in the way of us

268
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,520
implementing our politics is an illegitimate institution and must be dismantled and overthrown

269
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,000
and subverted because our politics are just that moral and righteous that's a lot of what the left

270
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,040
says right now and that's insane like no there needs to be some limit on everyone's politics

271
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,600
including yours you know i would agree with that yeah yeah so i i finally i and and you know the

272
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,520
right does it too because the right has now gone on like this anti-democracy arc of their own

273
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,720
because they lost an election right like um i think i mentioned in the fascism video i mentioned

274
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:04,320
something along the lines of um fascists tend to as soon as an institution produces a result that

275
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,320
they don't like they tend to completely delegitimize the institution they attack the rules of the game

276
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,400
rather than accepting the fact that they lost the game you know yeah and you see fascists on the

277
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,960
left do this and fascists on the right do this because fascism is neither left nor right yeah

278
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,040
in the oh i hate it when also when i i hear like um leftists who try to say that like oh fascism

279
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:35,040
is inherently right-wing and it's like well not um not really no no yeah um but yeah like the

280
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,720
it's just the acceptance like i know americans they really harp on about democracy a lot how

281
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,920
good it is and how moral it is and you know we're the country is like all this stuff but like there

282
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:55,520
there's other parts of politics that also need their due respect i think you know i'm not an

283
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,440
anarcho-capitalist i don't like the anarcho-capitalists i have read some of their

284
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,480
stuff and the one political innovation that's actually good that comes from the anarcho-capitalists

285
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:12,960
is when um hop i think i think he did it in democracy the god that failed hop said something

286
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:21,840
like rights are inherently anti-democratic yeah you know what you're saying exactly that makes

287
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,400
sense i get i get that makes sense yeah yeah you don't vote on rights yeah yeah the idea is that

288
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,280
like you know if you own a house you have a right to it and if a hundred people walk into your house

289
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,240
and vote themselves the owners of your house well no you own it your your right overrides their

290
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,760
democracy and you have the right to remove them with force you know so if you have a right to a

291
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,720
thing then the public's vote doesn't matter you know you know if you're if you have a right to

292
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,400
be gay it doesn't matter if the majority doesn't want you to be gay you can do what you want in

293
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,960
your private life you know so i think that's like the limit on that's a reasonable limit on

294
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:08,880
democracy is the idea of rights um yeah it's we we just seem to be in like a dark time right now

295
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,360
politically dark time what do you think the solution is um fuck the more that i look into

296
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,600
it the more the solution is probably just going to be a fight you know like like if you look at

297
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,800
like a fist fight or what no possibly a civil war in the united states i'm not gonna go i'm

298
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,840
not going full tim pool on you here i think it's a far i think like it's it might happen in the next

299
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,800
hundred years it might be a long time but like anytime you see tensions like this where you have

300
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,520
two groups that just live in different realities they tend over the course of history they've

301
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,520
always tended to just form their own nations you know like an east united states and a west united

302
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,320
states there would be like the coasts and the interior or something like that you know they

303
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:06,000
tend to like they tend to split up you know damn happens in the balkans east and west roman empire

304
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,200
like pick a country and it happens the only place it doesn't really happen is china china has always

305
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,880
had like massive wars of reunification they tend to stay together but like european history is

306
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,480
always about the history of of ethnicities and peoples and nations breaking up because they just

307
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,880
start living in different realities i wonder what that would look like i wonder if it was like the

308
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:36,480
postal united states and then there would be like the i don't know in in inside or whatever i don't

309
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,760
know what that would look like yeah i know um do you watch what if i'll test uh i don't what is that

310
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:51,360
uh what if i'll test he is primarily a history youtuber but he's also got a big brain here

311
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:02,800
let me find so he did he did a two-part video series where is it

312
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,840
a two-part video series two months ago and it's called explaining america's nine nations it's

313
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,240
a good it's a good it's like a two-hour watch it's a great watch oh shit he just goes really

314
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,560
he goes yeah he goes into detail of basically these nine ethnicities that exist on the american

315
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,240
continent and you've got like the caribbeans and you've got the midwesterners and you've got the

316
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,680
people living on like the west coast you've got the the kobeckers the kobeckers you know

317
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,440
the um the acadians that live in like the the northeast um northeast america and canada like

318
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,280
and it's just these are the ethnic okay i'm using ethnic in a in a european sense um yeah

319
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,560
like cultural traditions and habits the the differences between these nine these

320
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,680
nine geographic locations in north america yeah and they i mean it might here's the thing like

321
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,880
i don't want any sort of civil war i hope america like america has had some moments

322
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,080
where it's been pre-divided and usually they can bring it back to the center and like

323
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,400
hold on right i hope that happens again but it might not you know who who knows what the

324
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:22,480
future is going to bring who knows yeah wow but he he's a great channel he does so much

325
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,800
good stuff and he's um he is like a center right-leaning kind of guy and and sometimes

326
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:36,400
that comes through but he tends to focus mainly on just history and so he's i highly recommend

327
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:44,080
stuff yeah i'll take a look at his stuff it's super cool i know he uh he he debated vosh

328
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,880
like maybe six months ago or so and like he would have absolutely dumpstered vosh but

329
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,240
but he has no charisma and vosh is all charisma yeah so like clearly what if alt-hist had the

330
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,960
knowledge to just run circles around vosh but he didn't know how to say it and vosh just basically

331
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,600
went like squeaked through on the fumes it was a really funny debate to watch though

332
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:16,080
i i think it's interesting um i've noticed in these debates now that you can prepare a lot you

333
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,240
can know everything about a subject but if you know how to kind of work the conversation i feel

334
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,520
like you can know next to nothing about a subject and still make the other person look like an

335
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,840
idiot basically oh yeah fucking terrible and it's and it's and i feel like i've used it to

336
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:41,840
my advantage a couple of times and i feel a little bit bad about it so yeah um i know like

337
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,320
like back in 2017 the alt-right was learning that the whole the hard way because you had like the

338
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,600
you had like um you know the warski show warski live or whatever it was you had tonka's show and

339
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,480
stuff and they all just got by in charisma and it worked for a while but eventually you know reality

340
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,640
snaps back and they all got they all fell apart because i know um destiny debated them a bunch

341
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,560
sargon debated them a bunch and they all just kind of crumbled you know because eventually

342
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,920
that that stops working eventually people kind of figure it out eventually yeah yeah there's a guy

343
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,600
in the in your chat i think his name is elective tool he said that this guy this guy is sus i bet

344
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:25,360
i know his his idea on ukraine what do you think my idea on ukraine is dude yeah what is your idea

345
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,080
on ukraine i mean i'm i'm pro ukraine obviously yeah yeah i mean some people think that i'm like

346
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,080
oh god i mean it's because of the friends that i have right but like i'm not like a pro russia

347
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,520
simp that some of the people on the right seem to be like they that's that's fucking insane

348
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,320
that shit is weird to me like uh talk about they're siding with like like russia and and

349
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,480
i don't know they're buying up like russia and china talking points and it's like

350
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:00,160
bro you don't like china is the communist or they were the communists like you know this like what

351
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,960
are you doing why are you why are you backing the guy who wants to bring the ussr back again i mean

352
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,680
i don't know if he actually does but like you know like that's kind of what they're known for there

353
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,080
you you guys are literally backing them like you know what's going on there's a few reasons for

354
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,440
that um do you watch kraut's videos you know kraut is uh yeah i love kraut i used to watch

355
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:30,720
um his a lot of his videos actually um he just did a video on um on the political ideology of

356
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,760
putin's russia another hour-long video but it's amazing it's great um actually he used he i know

357
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,720
that he watched and critiqued my uh my fascism video and he actually got my reading list and

358
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,720
he used some of his some of my books for his video so that's that was actually pretty cool

359
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:56,560
to see um yeah but he um he goes basically into it's two russian fascists and then one

360
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,080
german and their political basically their political science writing and how these three

361
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,960
guys basically have influenced putin's putin's outlook on life and on politics

362
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:16,720
um and and basically when you see people when you see like western rightists they're simping

363
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,080
for russia and simping for putin their their view is some of it's going to be religious

364
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:31,840
because they they see the west as this decadent globohomo lgbtq rainbow capitalist nightmare

365
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,680
and it's and the only place that is um pushing forward traditional values

366
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,760
and and christian values is russia and the russian orthodox church and so this is the

367
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,800
only christianity we can get in politics we'll take it so some of them are siding with russia

368
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,480
for religious reasons um some of them are siding with russia because so so in this case this is

369
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,200
like the paul joseph watson's if you go over to his channel he has a video he made in the past

370
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,560
few months called like the end of the liberal world order or something like that and and what

371
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,960
these guys believe when they say liberal world order what they're talking about is like uh free

372
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,600
trade and you know just just the idea that the neo lib idea that like if you liberalize markets it

373
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,560
liberalizes politics which to be fair has actually failed at this point um the germans were buying

374
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,360
oil from the russians hoping that that the russians liberalizing their market would also

375
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,160
liberalize russian politics and it did not you know americans have been buying cheap shit from

376
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,880
china for 25 years because clinton and bush both believed that if china opened up its markets it

377
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,960
would liberalize their politics and it didn't so the neo libs were wrong on that um but there's

378
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,680
the they'll also call it like the rules based world order and basically these are guys that

379
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:01,200
want to see that collapsed and pulled apart as part of dismantling liberal hegemony because

380
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,480
they want to return to a more conservative way of viewing the world and and of doing politics

381
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,160
are more like insular we don't interfere in each of those countries anymore so we're dismantling

382
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,840
nato we're dismantling all these global alliances and everyone just stays in their lane i did call

383
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:24,400
bush a neo lib because bush was actually a neo lib the neo cons are neo libs yeah interesting

384
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,160
okay these economically i mean economically they are um so so you have guys like paul just

385
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,280
watson who are like listen if we want to challenge the the western liberal stranglehold on politics

386
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,840
and the western and the dominant western liberal block we need somebody who's willing to show that

387
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,480
all of the rules are just they're just a sham they're they're a paper tiger

388
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,560
so they want russia to win and in fact these people have basically been completely btfo'd

389
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,120
by the fact that ukraine has been winning the war they these are people who thought that the

390
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,720
war would be over in two weeks um so you have like the political reason you have the religious reason

391
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,360
and then you just have the fact that the russians are are basically like a new a new variant of

392
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,360
neo-fascist and then you have a bunch of post fascists in in the in the west and they're

393
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,400
basically just siding with them for that reason and so those are the three main reasons why you

394
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,560
see a lot of people on the right supporting russia and then there's like a fourth one and

395
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,600
the fourth one is like conspiracy laden where they just they just don't trust the west's

396
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:37,120
interpretation and you know to be fair the west has done some weird shit with propaganda as well

397
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,240
like we're not innocent of this so i i get it right you know you always have the cia overthrowing

398
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,520
governments in like the third world and you know people lying about this or that like you've seen

399
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,760
that in our history so they're basically saying hey what if all of the liberal history we've been

400
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,000
taught is just propaganda and so now they're like this is this is like for example what like aden

401
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,240
paladin thinks um on the right where like it where the entire narrative about ukraine cannot

402
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,360
be trusted because we've all seen it filtered through an american lens and the americans aren't

403
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:21,040
impartial yeah aden paladin is a um is i just talked to her recently i was really surprised

404
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,920
to hear that she's a monarchist um yes she's a libertarian monarchist actually yeah yeah that

405
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:35,680
was really which is a ridiculous idea idea yeah libertarian almost kind of like it

406
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,760
monarchist like man i i don't i'm i'm still wrapping my head around that one

407
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,520
yeah yeah she's really into patriarchal stuff she really likes the patriarchal

408
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,280
you know uh aspect of of like a religious kind of like monarchy or something like that

409
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,000
i mean i i hate to say it but i think part of that might just be sexual with her

410
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,320
um but i know part of it for sure yeah yeah you know i don't want to go too hard because

411
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,800
aden and i have had like it recently had a big fight oh okay yeah she basically whatever you

412
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,600
want to say well the tldr is that she she leaked my dms and i don't take that kindly so i i've

413
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,400
stopped associated she there's nothing like bad in them because i don't say bad things but i still

414
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,840
think it's like a breach of privacy so i was like you know what maybe you and i shouldn't

415
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,200
talk anymore you know um yeah but in terms of ideology the whole libertarian monarchist thing

416
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:39,040
is basically that she believes that government is a corporation and so to best run government

417
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,720
you should structure it like it's a corporation like it's privately owned so you have a monarch

418
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:50,000
who is like a president or a ceo someone who owns the company and then the landed aristocracy they're

419
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,160
like your middle managers and then your serfs are your employees and so the reason that she believes

420
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:03,040
that this makes sense is because someone who owns the company is not incentivized to destroy their

421
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,840
own company because they own it they generate wealth from it they care about it it's their

422
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,760
creation meanwhile an elected president can go into an office fuck it up for four years

423
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,640
you know his his his his um the next guy in line will will pardon him for any of his crimes then

424
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,680
he goes on to live a private life he gets a book deal you know he gets he gets he gets to go on tv

425
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,600
talk about how how he did these great things for four years as he fucked your country up

426
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:38,160
and so the the american presidential system means that individual bad actors have no accountability

427
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,360
if they come into power but in the libertarian monarchist system you are at least incentivized

428
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,400
to maintain the social structure because you are enriching yourself through it

429
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:59,040
now this is a retarded idea but i can see her point of view yeah i can at least see her point

430
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:08,000
of view oh hey pangas what's up man i guess i think you want pangas watches me and destiny

431
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,840
i think both of us oh cool so yeah yeah um i don't know how okay yeah i guess

432
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,880
dude i'm i'm just sorry about ranting so much no it's cool it's cool um i guess i don't know

433
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,720
how you can have a real like a libertarian monarchy with like a religious monarchy though

434
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,680
i just don't i just don't get it don't um i have to think about it some more

435
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,280
to be fair to her um she's come to religion recently and mainly out of her knowledge of

436
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,680
psychology because she's very well educated on psychology she has i think a master's degree in

437
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:57,200
psych yeah um she knows her stuff for sure so i i think a lot of a lot of her religious her

438
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,840
a lot of her recent religious experiences has been grounded in in psych to be fair that's how

439
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,280
a lot of people nowadays are get are getting to religions generally through psychology you know

440
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,880
they're they're reaching some limits of their own mind and and of their own they're like they're

441
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,480
starting to think about like oh well why are we this way and you know why do we think like this

442
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,040
why do we have these effects you know yeah um i think a lot of them come to religion because

443
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,200
they're you know psychology kind of leads them there i i don't fully understand that

444
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,000
myself because i'm an atheist yeah i i i need to look into this at some point i've been reading

445
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,840
some some psychology i i i took like intro to psych and then abnormal psych like 10 to 15 years

446
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:44,000
ago it's been a long time since i've been in school yeah um that's hens hops taking a nutshell

447
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,800
yeah yeah it is um hans herman hop he's the anacap guy okay okay um yeah i i don't know um much about

448
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,440
psychology um i guess one thing that i found interesting in in the psych world or whatever

449
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,520
or like the pseudo psych world is all all of these like youtube body language uh analyzers

450
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,440
have you found that weird because i find that shit really weird i actually don't know what

451
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,080
you're talking about oh yeah there are all these like youtubers who are like body language

452
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:22,240
analyzers and they try to tell you everything about somebody um based on like based based on

453
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,640
like uh the body language that they display during an interview or something like that

454
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,320
and they'll like over analyze it and it's super cringe in my opinion

455
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:37,520
i mean there's probably something to it you can definitely see like oh if you know if you sit

456
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,760
this way or you use your hands in this way like there's probably something there but i can see how

457
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,240
like all that stuff can also be faked if you're smart enough right so who actually knows you know

458
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,560
the issue is that i think when it comes to deception versus intuition the the perfect

459
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,280
i don't know deceptionist will always beat the perfect intuitionist in a lot of sense in a lot

460
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,880
of senses because you can always fake a thing and you can always fake it just as well as it can be

461
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:14,720
real when it comes to body language or how you speak how you lie you know so i think i i there's

462
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,960
probably something there but it's probably not like it's probably not anything that's universal

463
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,280
you know i'm sure a lot of it is just youtube nonsense because there's so much youtube nonsense

464
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:34,880
out there yeah actually that reminds me um when you were reacting to the um my fascism video

465
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,600
you i got to the part where i talked about the guy who said that that socialists should have sex with

466
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,400
children as a form of anti-fascism and you you kind of lost your mind a bit do you remember that

467
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,760
i don't remember what i said there but no what like what do you what happened i recall

468
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,240
or what do you recall i guess so the um well just that you you thought it was insane and you were

469
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,400
just like you're incredulous but but basically the idea was um you've got wilhelm reich who

470
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,960
wrote the mass psychology of fascism he was a socialist also a german psych psychoanalyst

471
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:18,240
and his view was that um sexual repression is what causes people to vote

472
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,040
fascist if they grow up in a sexually repressive society if they themselves are sexually repressed

473
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,640
then they're going if their politics will lean fascist these are one of the people that you that

474
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,320
that weren't fascists that wrote about fascism right yes yes okay all right makes a lot of sense

475
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:41,040
yeah and so his his view was because he like wrote in like the the prime age of freud's he

476
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,560
was very freudian right oh really okay yeah so it was all about sex it was all it's always about

477
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:54,000
sex with freud so he was he was basically talking about um how if we you know part of the socialist

478
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,680
project has to be a loosening of traditional sexual morality to be more inclusive and that

479
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,120
will combat fascism but then and i mean maybe there's something to that maybe there's not who

480
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:11,200
knows right but then continuing from his work was the italian communist mario mielli and he

481
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,080
continued on by saying oh yeah so he that guy was so correct that um we should actually have sex

482
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:28,560
with children because if we have sex with children it will create in them a form of sexuality that is

483
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:37,200
so open that they can never become fascists and he basically said that if you are a gay man

484
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,080
you must also be a pedophile for the good of the socialist project

485
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,120
i don't know i feel like this dude was just trying to take advantage of like

486
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,400
of what he can get do some such shit that's what i think honestly yes yeah obviously right yeah

487
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:02,240
like he he wrote this whole like 90 page manifesto on like the communist politics of italy and and

488
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,280
how like and how and how in order to prevent fascism from ever coming to power again in italy

489
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,040
you had to do certain things sexually with children like it was a whole big fucking thing

490
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:21,280
it's it's it was extremely ridiculous some of the things that he wrote about but holy fuck um

491
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:28,000
the one thing that i didn't mention in the video one thing because it was too spicy it was too

492
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:37,760
spicy yeah is that uh i know vosh swears by wilhelm reich in the mass psychology of fascism

493
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,040
and i don't know if he knows if if mario mielli like spun off from his work

494
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,240
yeah but you know that's that's just another point on the vosh sus list somebody's getting

495
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,040
longer and longer somebody should tell him maybe you should like be like yo do you know about this

496
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:01,920
like i don't know if you want to be associated with this guy like well to be fair vosh vosh

497
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,400
thinks i'm a fascist and he won't talk to me so oh really oh okay i don't know what vosh thinks

498
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,800
about me anymore i know that he liked talking to me at some point um and he would like possibly

499
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,800
pop into my streams uh pretty often and he would like talk to me every now and then but um i don't

500
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,840
know i think yeah i think because i'm like friendly with like pretty much everybody um

501
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,080
i don't know i think he's a little bit sus of me though yeah yeah i think i think the the the

502
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:40,640
destiny fault line went right through all you lefty tubers and you and rose wrist and econoboi

503
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,000
and all all these people have ended up on the destiny side of the uh of the earthquake you know

504
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:52,240
yeah damn i mean to be fair econobo is also really smart i've spoken to him too and he's

505
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,320
actually a pretty smart guy econobo is so smart yeah he is so smart he and i went back and forth

506
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,640
on about um about student loan debt forgiveness in the states and i said that it might be a

507
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,880
good idea but it's probably the wrong time to do it because it seems like it's a massive wealth

508
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,600
transfer from the um the lower class to the middle class so maybe not a good idea right

509
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,440
now because things are already pretty heated up in the american economy what did you think of that

510
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:24,480
of that policy i think um i think the way that that they are doing it seems pretty effective

511
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,200
like they're targeting specifically people who had pell grants right um those are going to be

512
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:36,960
people who probably need uh that relief the most so yes it is like a massive um transfer of wealth

513
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:45,600
i guess um but but it is it's alleviating things for like the people who need it the most and i

514
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:55,200
think i'm kind of okay with that but um yeah so so my argument against it was that you know if

515
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,240
the the libertarians seem to correctly say that if you print money you get inflation like those

516
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,240
are there's a correlation there you know yeah now there are some ways in which you can print money

517
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,600
that won't cause inflation um but that's like responsible money printing and sometimes the fed

518
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,040
is not so responsible it all always depends on what's going there's a bunch of different factors

519
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:20,720
here right so because you know for example if you wanted to start a business and if if money

520
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,120
and production are kind of like these two variables that you want to keep in line

521
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,360
if you print a bunch of money but don't increase production you've just caused inflation

522
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,880
but if you print money and then give that money out in terms of grants to people who can now start

523
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,640
businesses that wouldn't be able to start them well now they're more productive so production

524
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,400
actually goes up so there's ways to print money that actually also increases production so you

525
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,960
don't actually get inflation out of printing money it's possible um just you have to be really

526
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,800
responsible about it but if you print money to forgive debt what ends up happening is that you

527
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,080
have a bunch of middle class people who hold the debt because they're they're the students who have

528
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,680
gone to college and a college degree means you're going to make more money than people who don't go

529
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,560
to college generally speaking so you have this this middle class group of students who get their

530
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:12,720
debt forgiven and you're printing money to do it so the rich don't care because one the rich hold

531
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,880
not wealth but assets so they don't have like liquid money that's being devalued in their

532
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,040
bank accounts they have buildings and property and whatever um but even if they do they don't

533
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,360
care they're rich like who cares if food prices go up right but for the poor the absolute poorest of

534
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,920
the poor they might only have like 10 20 100 bucks in their account or something the guys

535
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,520
live in paycheck to paycheck well now everything's more expensive for them um and so if you're

536
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:43,840
printing money to give to the middle class that seems to be siphoning meaningful wealth directly

537
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:50,880
out of the lower class to do it um and in my opinion it just seems to not have been the right

538
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:57,040
time to do that policy considering all the other stimulus biden had done you know because there's

539
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,920
so much stimulus you can do at one point at one point in time before it starts causing inflation

540
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,920
you know maybe i should have waited a bit i mean i'm sure he did it just to try to win the midterms

541
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,520
right so i mean there's a political reason too well kind of boy did make a good point though

542
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,760
that like for for what we're experiencing he like did a breakdown of like the percentages right of

543
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,960
like how much something is contributing to inflation and like um how much stimulus was

544
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,840
was contributing to inflation all of this right and he and he basically made a breakdown he

545
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,320
basically made the argument that whatever inflation we are incurring from these um

546
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:39,680
from from these um policies or these these things that biden is uh like passing um it's worth it

547
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,440
because what we're getting in return is so much more is essentially what he's been saying um

548
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,720
i don't know if he's done that for the student loan thing i think he did it for the uh

549
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:55,840
uh the the covid stimulus probably yeah the code stimulus yeah yeah yeah i i and here's the thing

550
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,480
i i did a similar video um i just called it bidenflation with a bunch of meme symbols in

551
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,960
it because it was kind of fun i know my audience got mad at me for it but i did a similar analysis

552
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,600
we probably used the same um the same report that came out because there was a report that came out

553
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,840
like at the start of the year about how much money biden had spent on stimulus so we probably covered

554
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:21,360
the same thing but the idea was basically like um if inflation is eight percent we can attribute

555
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,760
maybe two percent of that to the war in ukraine we can attribute one to two percent of that at

556
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,240
uh background inflation which is normal and then we can attribute four percent of that to um

557
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,880
to biden stimulus and so if you have four percent as actually the result of biden printing money to

558
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,600
give out to people to try and keep the economy afloat during covid um well then what did you

559
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,960
get for that four percent inflation and you could say like well we save so many jobs and we you know

560
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,920
so many people had certain debts relieved and so many people were able to like you know um

561
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,400
keep their keep their heads above water when they had no money and so maybe you can say that four

562
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,920
percent inflation is worth that and there's an argument to be made on the numbers there

563
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,080
you know how much did you get and is four percent inflation worth it um but i think the right wing

564
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:17,200
accurately points out that a lot of that inflation happened because of the lockdowns anyway

565
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,720
and now the right doesn't care about the negative effects of covid right they some of them don't

566
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,880
believe that they're it's real some of them say it's not that bad some of them say you know what

567
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,120
our personal liberties are more important and you shouldn't have locked us down that's probably the

568
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,200
most reasonable argument on the right is that you know this wasn't worth what we paid for it

569
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,440
you shouldn't have locked us down okay fair enough we can accept that um just for argument's sake we

570
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,440
can accept it so yeah they're going to say hey listen biden you don't get credit for keeping

571
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,480
people afloat when it was government action that put their heads below water anyway and i think

572
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,240
that's a fair criticism okay yeah yeah if that's the case i can definitely see their their argument

573
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:04,800
there um yeah i don't know um the the thing though is that they're wrong but yeah um like

574
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:13,920
that's you know yeah maybe maybe like explain you know if you lock down and then that destroys

575
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,160
businesses and destroys jobs and destroys industries well then you have to ask well

576
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,320
was the lockdown worth it was the amount of locking down that you did worth the economic

577
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:28,640
damage that you incurred and if the answer is no well then you can't really give biden the credit

578
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:34,080
for saying well i offset it by printing a bunch of money and giving it to you it's like well

579
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,880
that was kind of a band-aid though like i don't know if america would have been better off if you

580
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:48,000
had more infections more deaths but more freedom that's a hard question to answer you know maybe

581
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,560
maybe i don't know that it would be because i think our already our medical facilities were

582
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:59,760
like um pretty swamped i had friends who worked in the medical industry um just with the way that

583
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,680
it was with with the lockdowns that we had um medical professionals have been like retiring

584
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:12,320
left and right um and i had friends who were nurses who were experiencing so much more death

585
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:20,400
than they were used to um so i think that that was a huge strain on that industry and i think

586
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,640
that industry is going to be recovering for a really long time and if it had been any worse

587
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:32,640
i'm not really sure what uh would have happened i guess to that industry you know that's fair but

588
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,520
at the same time you know i live in canada where we had a much more strict lockdown than you guys

589
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,480
did in the states and we experienced all that stuff too we have nurse burnout we have we have

590
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,360
deaths we have businesses that have been destroyed you know um we had a trucker protest which is you

591
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,600
know that you know rebelling against the government might be a normal occurrence in the united states

592
00:59:53,600 --> 01:00:01,360
that never happens here like that was a once in in a generation event here in canada um so like

593
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:08,160
it see it may be the case that locking down prevented some catastrophe but i feel like

594
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,760
like you really have to lock down to prevent all the catastrophe like china has gone full

595
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,360
authoritarian mode destroying everything in their path and it hasn't helped that much you know what

596
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:26,320
i mean so i think there's there's like there's diminishing returns on lockdowns and it may be the

597
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:33,040
case that some people on the left went too far or advocated going too far despite the cost that

598
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,480
they would have paid otherwise you know what i mean like it seems like there was no good answer here

599
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,480
yeah it's really hard to say like you're right it's um it's it's really hard to say

600
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,720
how things would have been different when we didn't do those things i guess

601
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,040
so in the chat says we should have done the florida protocol for the entire uia

602
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,840
us where old people were kept inside and young people were able to be out and about

603
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,280
i mean maybe because young people weren't like affected that much by covid in the end it was all

604
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:09,440
old people you know so maybe maybe and then here's the other here's the other side of the

605
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,440
conversation we never fully locked down like we were supposed to if we had done it right it would

606
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,960
have been worth it without question are you sure about that though because early in the pandemic

607
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,560
you saw like chinese people being welded into their apartment blocks and you had like soldiers

608
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:28,080
on the street blasting like cleaners everywhere on the roads and and like people getting arrested

609
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:34,000
for going outside like you want like a full fully locked down where no one moves no one goes to

610
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,240
work like everything shuts down i don't think that would have been worth it like you have yeah well

611
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:47,120
them giga like if you want to see what a full a true lockdown is you can look at china and

612
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:52,160
like that was insane like that was nuts yeah that is and i think they're still they're still doing

613
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,240
they're still doing their like zero covid policy i believe like or at least i saw like a couple

614
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,640
of months ago like people were getting like transported to different facilities that they

615
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:11,440
tested positive for uh for covid and that shit's fucking crazy yep yeah so like it seems like there

616
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,120
was just no good answer here it was like either lots of people die and you have your freedom or

617
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,880
like you have varying restrictions that get more and more draconian

618
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,680
yeah you can walk down people without going so far as to people in their homes no you can't

619
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,480
because people are going to go outside they want to you know uh china's still welding people into

620
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,520
their apartments apparently i i was not aware of that but they apparently like they have some weird

621
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,080
i don't know i don't know if this is true or not because this could just be chinese like propaganda

622
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,800
or whatever but they were talking about they have this uh this this cool like grocery app and you

623
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,200
can get gross groceries delivered to you or whatever and i don't know how how real that is

624
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,600
you know so yeah well i mean we have like instacart over here and stuff so yeah maybe right maybe

625
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:05,440
no i've seen a lot of um did you see oh fuck so i do a podcast with lilith lovett if you know who

626
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:12,480
that is i don't know uh sorry she's this whole space she's um she's she's a trans porn actress

627
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:20,160
okay but she's but she's chinese she's from taiwan um and so we we did a video um on china maybe two

628
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,400
or three weeks ago no i was i was sick back then it was longer than that we did something

629
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,880
and we did just what what was happening in china and we watched a bunch of videos and she

630
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:37,040
translated and there was like people who were stuck in apartment blocks in shanghai who were

631
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,600
just starving in their apartments and they were all like hanging out their windows on their

632
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:47,680
balconies um like yelling stuff like we're starving we're dying in here and then like

633
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:53,600
a government drone flew in and like on loudspeaker on the drone told them all to shut up

634
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,360
and it was like this is like this is the dystopian cyberpunk future you know yeah

635
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:06,240
wow oh panga sent you a video of the apartments if you want to see it

636
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:15,040

642
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,480
little translate because i didn't know what was going on like you know i spent some time in china

yeah you can see the sparks coming from underneath yeah so crazy and hold on

654
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:25,760

okay just find it here i autistically save like everything for videos and streams

656
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,560
i was going to my china file for a minute the zenshine nine says china was so extreme

657
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,680
there should be a middle ground somewhere at least we should not have had politicians lying to us

658
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,040
saying it was all a planned world unleashed pandemic or that dems made it happen on purpose

659
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:55,360
that would have been nice yeah that would have been nice uh i mean i i understand like the

660
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:05,280
the anger about some of the um uh what's what i'm trying to say here there's anger about

661
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:14,480
how people seem to be very hypocritical about who gets to say what you know like if you said that

662
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:23,280
if you said that this was a lab leak you know in 2020 or 2021 you'd be banned off social media you

663
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:30,240
were called like a nazi conspiracy theorist alex jones watcher and until john stewart said it on

664
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,720
his show and then it's like oh why is he allowed to say it now you know and now you have people in

665
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,560
congress saying i was like well come on guys like there was so much double standards on what you

666
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,160
were allowed to say whether or not it was correct like maybe it would have been all just conspiracy

667
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:48,480
theory but people shouldn't have been like kicked out of the internet for saying it i think i think

668
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,560
the issue is that when the original the original person who talked about it being a lab leak was

669
01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:00,320
not talking about it being a a malicious lab leak right the person who was initially saying that it

670
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:06,640
was it could have been a leak from from one of the labs was saying that basically they were known um

671
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:12,880
for for going into bat caves without the proper gear and they were known for not wearing the

672
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,880
proper gear when taking samples from different places and that um and that it may have been a

673
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:27,040
leak um through i guess just just over exposure and and you know not enough protective gear right

674
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:34,320
i think that's what it was basically so it was like a negligence leak and not not like a man-made

675
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:40,560
virus that was leaked out into the world it was just they were doing testing on um on these

676
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:47,040
different caves and these different areas and uh and probably were not um following the safest

677
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:53,120
protocol um but i think i think there's a huge difference between saying that and then saying

678
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:59,760
that like it was man-made the cdc funded the you know funded it the cdc funded it and created it

679
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,320
and unleashed it upon us and all of that right i think there's a huge difference

680
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:10,320
yeah yeah i completely agree with you i think that there's like there's a shredding of social

681
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,360
trust when it comes to what you're allowed to say online right now like for example on unlike

682
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:23,520
on right-wing twitter you can see like a 10-minute collage of people who are democratic party members

683
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:30,880
and like elected people even biden and hillary um this 10-minute collage of them openly saying

684
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:36,720
that donald trump didn't win 2016 and it's like well jesus christ we've been talking about how

685
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:41,760
dangerous it is to how dangerous it is to democracy to deny the 2020 election what have

686
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:46,400
you guys been doing for four fucking years you know like on the right there's this deep sense

687
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,200
that everything is just hypocritical right now and that people aren't playing by the same rules

688
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:56,000
and it's like what the fuck so like yeah i don't fully agree with them but i get where they're

689
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,200
coming from i understand where they're coming from but again like hillary didn't take a whole

690
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:07,840
long time to concede she she conceded the next day yeah you know so yeah she conceded the next day

691
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,120
um and you know whether or not she said well i won the popular vote well the popular vote doesn't

692
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,920
really matter right like we know the way that the election works um well i i think i think one of

693
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,400
the clips though was like in 2018 where she's like donald trump is an illegitimate president

694
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:27,040
she's like outright says like jesus christ like come on that's a bit irresponsible yeah yeah

695
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,640
stupid for her to say that yeah i think i might do a video on that because i do know at least some

696
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,880
people on the on the center left watch me so i want to i want to like expose both sides to what

697
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,640
they're missing you know what i mean that's kind of been my goal from the channel recently sure

698
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,680
i think that i think that's a you know really fair thing to say and i'm willing to concede that like

699
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,680
you know she's said things that maybe she shouldn't have said there are things that

700
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,520
democratic candidates have said that they shouldn't have said but like when it comes

701
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,840
down to the actual actions at least she conceded the next day at least she didn't um uh end up

702
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,760
suing like you know trying to sue a whole bunch of states and and stirring up a whole bunch of

703
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:13,760
um people who who honestly feel like um the rug was pulled from under them and

704
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:23,280
honestly you know feel like they have to fight you know the government basically right like i

705
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,560
feel like at least she didn't do that i feel like there's a there's still a difference in like the

706
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:34,880
amount of of extremes that both sides are going to i don't know no i agree i agree with you yeah

707
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:42,880
in the end you know there's something that you say two years later on cnn to rile your base

708
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,920
up and then there's what you actually file in court those are two different things for sure

709
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:52,640
yeah and and you know also just regarding the whole russian thing like i kind of um i kind of

710
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:59,040
side with like what julia yafi has said on it um and she said that basically like the russian uh

711
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:07,280
like the fsb um them finding what they found like with the emails or whatever um was kind of

712
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:13,760
like a fluke accident right it wasn't like they were trying to make hillary lose the election

713
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:21,120
they they weren't sure like how how effective they would be um in in hurting her campaign
