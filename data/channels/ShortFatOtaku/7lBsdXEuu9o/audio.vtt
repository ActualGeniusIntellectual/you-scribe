WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.120
hello hello hey how's it going is your mouse working it's now working yeah sorry

00:10.960 --> 00:19.440
so what's going on uh not much um uh was watching obama speak but i kind of got bored honestly um

00:20.720 --> 00:27.280
yeah so usually i'm not gonna buy his his speeches but um yeah i just yeah i don't know even he's not

00:27.280 --> 00:35.280
doing it today hey i guess not um so what's what's new with you okay just give me a minute

00:35.280 --> 00:42.800
i'm gonna post in my discord that i'm chatting with you for a little bit here okay just give

00:42.800 --> 00:49.280
me a minute you're gonna use that at everyone oh boy that's fun actually i have a new twitter

00:49.280 --> 00:58.880
account now too don't tell anyone oh really yeah it's it's called morbius devo oh i'm new do we

00:58.880 --> 01:05.760
know him yes this is uh sfo you recently watched my um three forms of fascism video yeah a few

01:05.760 --> 01:11.680
weeks ago right well i was still sick and you were sick i was sick yeah i was just sick for a really

01:11.680 --> 01:17.520
long time yeah it was a really good video i really like that oh well thank you yeah i think um it's

01:17.520 --> 01:23.440
interesting because whenever i talk to people on the left who are always mad at me about who i

01:23.440 --> 01:32.960
talk to about like um like for example if i'm talking to like far right people they never seem

01:32.960 --> 01:39.440
the people who criticize me on the left or even libs never seem to fully understand what they're

01:39.440 --> 01:46.480
criticizing like they don't know the basics of that sphere and then they think that they have the

01:47.200 --> 01:51.680
knowledge to like debate me on whether i should be talking to them or not if they don't even know

01:51.680 --> 01:57.520
that it's not even called the alt-right anymore like like this is years old information like

01:57.520 --> 02:03.840
and people are are so like just out of touch and they still think like richard spencer's around or

02:03.840 --> 02:10.720
something yeah he's still relevant and stuff no he i mean look he's still doing whatever i don't

02:10.720 --> 02:14.560
know what the fuck he's doing but he's doing something with his friend but nobody listens

02:14.560 --> 02:24.000
to him anymore you know yeah yeah yeah fuck no i think things have changed you know since since

02:24.000 --> 02:29.920
2016 since politics really blew up online things have kind of gone through several waves you know

02:29.920 --> 02:33.760
we had like the alt-right they were doing their thing for a while then bread tube but now bread

02:33.760 --> 02:42.240
tubes kind of gone like no one watches them anymore yeah i don't even yeah i i don't know

02:42.240 --> 02:45.760
what happened to bread tube but somebody called me a breadtuber the other day and i

02:45.760 --> 02:50.000
i don't know it was weird that a few times actually yeah yeah well there's a thing right

02:50.000 --> 02:55.040
now because the right also doesn't understand the left online either so yeah you know sargon

02:55.040 --> 03:00.320
you know sargon and i were good friends we talk every day but he has he has taken to calling

03:00.320 --> 03:08.640
everyone who's not as right wing as him a communist and i'm just like well no i've heard

03:08.640 --> 03:15.760
his logic and i can explain his logic and the logic is basically that the promises of liberalism

03:15.760 --> 03:21.920
always go ultimately unfulfilled by liberalism so liberalism always degenerates into communism

03:21.920 --> 03:27.680
so if you're a liberal it's only a matter of time that sounds like a mixed vivian wolf argument

03:27.680 --> 03:33.840
honestly uh like the opposite of one like oh liberals always turn into fascists because they

03:33.840 --> 03:40.880
always help fascists or something yes yeah and they both kind of think that of of each other i've

03:40.880 --> 03:47.840
noticed that so if you were to actually search like hold on let me just give me give me a second here

03:48.480 --> 03:57.200
all right if you search like the the phrase the promises of liberalism right you will see a lot

03:57.200 --> 04:05.120
you'll find articles and and um and papers and all these things basically about how the liberals

04:05.120 --> 04:11.600
promised under the french revolution they promised um liberty equality and fraternity and the

04:11.600 --> 04:18.160
socialists believe they haven't actually brought any of those values into into politics but

04:18.160 --> 04:25.200
socialism well socialism promises more liberty and more equality and more fraternity does does

04:25.200 --> 04:33.520
socialism on paper i don't even know if on paper it does but okay yeah so on paper it's like in

04:33.520 --> 04:37.840
reality it does not it cannot actually achieve these things but on paper though i mean you hear

04:37.840 --> 04:42.000
this all the time right if you're talking to some breadtuber they'll say listen you like democracy

04:42.000 --> 04:47.040
right stardust well we just want to expand democracy we're expanding it into the workplace

04:47.040 --> 04:50.640
so they're appealing to this idea that the promises of liberalism have failed

04:51.600 --> 04:58.000
and so sargon who has read a lot of the far left stuff he's like oh i guess they're correct so if

04:58.000 --> 05:03.040
you're a liberal you're always going to generate into a communist so sargon is now a conservative

05:03.040 --> 05:10.960
and that's his logic for it it's like well all right wow so so he and like i'm i'm still good

05:10.960 --> 05:14.480
friends with him but he and i we have like arguments all the time i enjoy the arguments

05:14.480 --> 05:19.760
they're fun because we can still be friends even though we disagree right yeah but um you know he's

05:19.760 --> 05:23.680
he's off doing his his lotus eaters thing and it seems you're working out well for him he's got a

05:23.680 --> 05:27.840
couple hundred thousand subs he's built a few new channels like he's doing okay he has like an

05:27.840 --> 05:33.040
office and a staff like a dozen people like he's doing that's based yeah good for him yeah so he's

05:33.040 --> 05:39.920
still he's still doing okay um i expected well i guess i understand his argument but i guess i

05:39.920 --> 05:49.280
just would have expected some more nuance from him but yeah he so he's been doing a lot of reading

05:50.160 --> 05:55.440
hey tidge how's it going he's been tidge is like the resident femboy of my community

05:55.440 --> 05:59.360
what up femboy sorry i should probably call you by your name what up tidge

05:59.360 --> 06:04.720
all right sargon's are doing a lot of reading oh yeah honestly a lot of the same reading that

06:04.720 --> 06:08.720
i did for the fascism video just to understand some of this stuff you know yeah and a lot of

06:08.720 --> 06:15.200
it has led him down a traditionalist rabbit hole interesting and also i think a lot of that is just

06:15.200 --> 06:18.560
the fact that he's uh he's a dad now you know people tend to become more conservative when

06:18.560 --> 06:22.320
they have parent when they have kids yeah just like a normal trend you know i don't blame him

06:23.600 --> 06:26.720
um there was one thing i noticed i was watching your obama video

06:26.720 --> 06:32.480
he talked about the nancy pelosi husband hammer attacker right it was just a few days ago that

06:32.480 --> 06:39.120
a friend of mine paul pelosi was attacked in his own home somebody breaks into his house looking

06:39.120 --> 06:46.000
for his wife nancy the speaker of the house and thankfully he's he's back home now and we're

06:46.000 --> 06:50.880
going to let investigators do their jobs but but here's what's clear pittsburgh

06:51.920 --> 06:58.960
this habit we've had we have of demonizing political opponents of saying crazy stuff

07:00.320 --> 07:07.760
it creates a dangerous climate and and when you have people who are in leadership positions

07:07.760 --> 07:14.080
who promote or ignore over the top rhetoric and then when there's an attack like this they make

07:14.080 --> 07:18.560
light of it they joke about it then more people are going to get hurt

07:20.800 --> 07:27.120
and more than that we violate the basic spirit of our democracy the spirit of who we are as

07:27.120 --> 07:33.200
americans and how like people on on the right are kind of making fun of it or they're saying that

07:33.200 --> 07:38.160
you know it might have been like a guy who was trying to have sex with him and then it went awry

07:38.160 --> 07:41.600
and like there's all these things going on with that story and we don't know what's going on yet

07:42.560 --> 07:50.560
um he seems to be correct i mean i don't expect obama to necessarily be bipartisan he's clearly

07:50.560 --> 07:56.960
a democrat right but like did you hear about the shooting of the republican candidate a couple days

07:56.960 --> 08:04.400
ago no i did not yeah so this is yeah let me just pull it out real quick i i talked about it this

08:04.400 --> 08:11.040
morning on the weekly sip do i still have it um yeah republican congressional candidate candidates

08:11.360 --> 08:17.840
pat herrington's house was shot up and his children were inside holy shit he's running against

08:17.840 --> 08:22.720
democrat jeff jackson and yeah they're okay he's running against democrat jeff jackson in district

08:22.720 --> 08:26.720
14 the fbi is investigating let's see if i can find an article so you don't just have to take my

08:26.720 --> 08:38.320
word for it which state is this again uh let me see let me see let me see uh pat herrington is

08:38.320 --> 08:48.400
the name uh harrigan sorry north carolina okay here here's the ap news article so one thing i've

08:48.400 --> 08:55.760
noticed is that the right wing of the internet is talking about this like 24 7 right now okay

08:55.760 --> 09:02.560
they're talking about how there's some deranged leftoid who's going around shooting up uh

09:02.560 --> 09:07.360
republican candidates who are running for office and how this is ridiculous and the left has gone

09:07.360 --> 09:12.800
too far and this is too much meanwhile at the same time you ignore on the left on the left

09:12.800 --> 09:18.720
side of the internet's talking about this but no one on the right is talking about any violence

09:18.720 --> 09:23.920
that their guys commit you know like we we've reached this point in politics where it seems like

09:24.720 --> 09:30.960
it seems like both sides are just willing to point the finger at their opponents but ignore it when

09:30.960 --> 09:40.320
their side does it you know what i mean yeah okay i could see that um yeah do they know who did the

09:40.320 --> 09:46.400
shooting not yet the fbi is still investigating this is like two days old this is two days old

09:46.400 --> 09:52.640
damn i know you watched another one of my videos where i went over just like a lot of the stuff

09:52.640 --> 09:57.120
that like a lot of people who were just regular republican voters who were getting harassed over

09:57.120 --> 10:00.800
the course like like that i know i know you watched the video and you like exclaimed a lot

10:00.800 --> 10:06.320
of shock at the one guy who got his like eye socket broken um yeah where he like he was like

10:06.320 --> 10:09.920
an asian guy in new york he just like wore a mega hat around and then a bunch of people just kicked

10:09.920 --> 10:14.480
the shit out of them you know and you don't see that reported on so i i think i think we've

10:14.480 --> 10:19.920
reached this point in at least american politics where both sides are existing in a completely

10:19.920 --> 10:26.240
different news bubble and they're only seeing the stuff that makes them look like victims and makes

10:26.240 --> 10:32.320
their political opponents look like basically nazis and that's a pretty dangerous place to be

10:32.320 --> 10:36.480
in because no one people aren't talking the same language anymore yeah that is dangerous that's

10:36.480 --> 10:43.680
very dangerous um it's interesting there's that you say like victim and like then the other side

10:43.680 --> 10:52.240
is the aggressor um and i find that that like repeating in a lot of different um spheres online

10:52.240 --> 10:57.680
and in person where um there's like this paint i don't know what it is but it seems like everybody

10:57.680 --> 11:05.120
right now is kind of like bent on painting themselves as victims of uh of someone or you

11:05.120 --> 11:11.120
know whatever like i don't know it just seems it seems like people are very obsessed with the whole

11:11.120 --> 11:20.160
victimhood thing yeah yeah so there's there's a paper that was written maybe in 2009 it was a

11:20.240 --> 11:25.600
philosophy paper i know sargon showed it to me i know that taftaj has read it but i forget the

11:25.600 --> 11:29.360
name of the guy i can tell you the ideas but i forget the name of the guy who wrote it but he

11:29.360 --> 11:37.360
basically said that all of politics and all of morality does ultimately come down to justifying

11:37.360 --> 11:44.640
victimhood and how every political camp behaves in the exact same way they just have different

11:44.640 --> 11:50.720
targets and his argument was basically that if you look at fascists right the fascists they

11:50.720 --> 11:58.560
always claim to be victims of something you know there there's some group out there that is

11:58.560 --> 12:02.960
oppressing them it can be the jews or it can be the blacks or it can be it could be race mixers

12:02.960 --> 12:06.560
it can be it can be marxists or liberals or whoever but there's a group out there that's

12:06.560 --> 12:12.720
oppressing them and they're doing things to them that violate their nazi code of ethics

12:13.520 --> 12:17.360
and so they are they're victims and they're justified in oppressing them back

12:17.360 --> 12:21.520
and from the nazi point of view they're correct because the nazis happen to have an ethical code

12:21.520 --> 12:27.600
that they follow and the liberals necessarily have to oppress them so they are actually victims

12:27.600 --> 12:30.400
and the socialists say the same thing the socialists always say well we're victims of

12:30.400 --> 12:36.080
the capitalist system and and of the and of a you know like a you know the bourgeois and whoever

12:36.080 --> 12:42.240
right and from their point of view they're also correct so they because they have defined what

12:42.320 --> 12:46.960
aggression is as capitalist action if you know if you own property that's aggression right

12:46.960 --> 12:51.200
things like that and then if you look at the liberals liberals do the same thing because

12:51.200 --> 12:57.920
the liberals will say well we only oppress people who are censors or who who do oppressing first

12:57.920 --> 13:02.960
but that's still ultimately oppressing the liberal political opponents because it's only the

13:02.960 --> 13:10.160
liberals who value non-aggression who or who values self-defense as its own virtue so like

13:10.160 --> 13:15.360
whenever when when people say there was a debate it was destiny versus a muslim guy

13:15.360 --> 13:21.040
like last year or something and the muslim guy basically said well we like the liberals are

13:21.040 --> 13:24.080
oppressing us and the destiny said well how are the liberals oppressing you it's like well they

13:24.080 --> 13:31.280
won't let us right sorry who do you know his name yeah i think it's daniel hikikichu it might be i

13:31.280 --> 13:35.040
don't remember his name but he said that he basically said that the liberals are preventing

13:35.040 --> 13:39.360
us from applying sharia law and it's like well isn't sharia law oppressive and he's like not

13:39.360 --> 13:45.440
to us it isn't because every political camp defines what constitutes aggression and what

13:45.440 --> 13:52.080
constitutes oppression in in basically in their in their own favor and so after they've created

13:52.080 --> 13:56.880
that normativity they can then go after their political opponents for violating the normativity

13:56.880 --> 14:02.560
so liberals and socialists and fascists they all behave in the same way in the end they just have

14:02.560 --> 14:09.440
different targets and it really just boils down to well what targets do you find do you think are

14:09.440 --> 14:14.640
morally acceptable to go after and as soon as you realize that's what politics is everything becomes

14:14.640 --> 14:20.320
very scary you know what i mean yeah because now now it's much harder to actually negotiate

14:20.320 --> 14:25.120
anything and i think that's that's like the road that we've all gone down recently is that no one's

14:25.120 --> 14:32.960
negotiating anymore no one's listening to each other anymore yeah um yeah no it does it seems

14:32.960 --> 14:39.280
like even like 10 years ago um politics used to be like way more bipartisan i'm not really sure

14:39.280 --> 14:44.480
if it's like social media and algorithms that's made people more siloed or what um

14:46.560 --> 14:51.680
but i mean part of that yeah yeah it's part of it but i think there are some sacrifices that we do

14:51.680 --> 14:58.480
need to to make right like if liberalism is oppressive to towards people who want to

14:59.040 --> 15:04.800
practice sharia law unfortunately we are going by like what the majority wants here

15:04.800 --> 15:12.400
the majority does not want sharia law the majority um would not um be okay with sharia law

15:12.960 --> 15:20.640
uh so i mean at a certain point we like yeah it may be oppressive in some sort of way to you but

15:21.280 --> 15:29.120
um i would say it is justified i guess sure but but then all that means is that if you ever lose

15:29.120 --> 15:33.040
the majority then you're you're automatically wrong right so for example if you go to a muslim

15:33.040 --> 15:39.280
majority country and you're relying on on that sentiment to to basically guide your morality

15:39.280 --> 15:44.000
well now suddenly it's moral to to oppress gay people if you live in a muslim majority country

15:44.640 --> 15:51.440
so that also has its own pitfalls that that's why you know i was we were both i know you were

15:51.440 --> 15:56.480
on the call and i was listening to the call yeah of um over on destiny's channel earlier about the

15:56.480 --> 16:03.360
whole like anti-democracy arc or whatever and like there's a decent argument there's actually

16:03.360 --> 16:09.120
a few solid decent arguments to be to just strictly being anti-democracy and i think like

16:09.120 --> 16:13.520
the you know do you want to live in a country where the majority of people want to oppress you

16:13.600 --> 16:18.880
that's a pretty good one right there right like if you're if you're gay living in saudi arabia

16:20.080 --> 16:23.520
it is the democratic will of the people that you be thrown off the building and it's like well

16:23.520 --> 16:30.560
that's no good you know there there's there has to be some some kind of virtue system that is

16:30.560 --> 16:34.480
above democracy i think which is a very strange way to put it because i'm still a liberal but

16:34.480 --> 16:39.360
you know what i mean yeah there's something going on here um okay

16:44.800 --> 16:49.040
i mean i i don't know i feel i i guess what i would hope for if i were living in one of

16:49.040 --> 16:55.280
those countries is that over time you know culture would change and that through the culture changing

16:55.280 --> 17:03.280
um people would enact change in their government and things like that but uh yeah if if everybody

17:05.200 --> 17:12.080
if if i guess if a majority of the population occupies a place and it's like an actual democracy

17:12.080 --> 17:18.400
and majority that population believes in things that are going to be oppressive very oppressive

17:18.400 --> 17:27.840
to specific groups then i guess you yeah you have a point um and to be fair that is the world we

17:27.840 --> 17:31.760
live in now yeah you know because because we do oppress non-liberals in liberal countries you know

17:31.760 --> 17:36.240
we don't let the socialists you know have their violent revolution here we have to oppress them

17:37.280 --> 17:41.120
someone's always getting oppressed yeah that's that's just the nature of politics right yeah

17:41.120 --> 17:46.800
i guess so yeah i guess i would just say it's justified but then whether

17:48.640 --> 17:54.960
i i would say it's justified that um that they are getting oppressed in some sort of way but

17:56.720 --> 17:59.760
if it were the opposite like you're saying um in a different country where

18:00.640 --> 18:05.920
the majority wants to throw somebody off a building um i i don't know that i i would

18:05.920 --> 18:10.720
necessarily say that it's justified to throw them off the building but i would just say it's

18:10.720 --> 18:17.360
justified for them to enact that because the majority voted that way i guess maybe i don't

18:17.360 --> 18:23.840
know yeah that's where we get to the part that like democracy can be just as oppressive as any

18:23.840 --> 18:29.040
kind of dictatorship in the end where it all depends on on what the power is used for right

18:29.760 --> 18:36.080
so sure sure yeah it can be um it can be but i think there's less i think there's more

18:36.080 --> 18:41.200
opportunities for it to not be oppressive i guess oh sure like here's the thing i'm still

18:41.200 --> 18:45.520
ultimately pro-democracy i just know the anti-democracy argument very well like like

18:45.520 --> 18:51.440
for example the um i don't know if you've made it public where you live do you are you in california

18:51.440 --> 18:58.640
or la i'm not no okay but you know but you know about the um the urban sprawl problem there right

18:59.280 --> 19:05.440
how it's just like hundreds of miles of houses yeah it sucks yeah yeah so that's a problem

19:05.440 --> 19:10.560
that's uh that's unique to democracy actually because if you have you know you have a

19:10.560 --> 19:14.400
neighborhood where everyone where there's a bunch of small landowners right and well what's what's

19:14.400 --> 19:17.600
what would be good for that neighborhood is if you build an apartment block because if you build

19:17.600 --> 19:23.120
an apartment block that those are going to be cheaper places to rent that poor people can go

19:23.120 --> 19:29.520
live in and then now suddenly demand for all that housing goes way down but and so now people can

19:29.520 --> 19:33.040
actually buy houses and own houses the middle class can actually have houses again like they

19:33.040 --> 19:38.400
could 50 years ago but the problem with that is that that also means that um the property values

19:38.400 --> 19:47.040
go down and every single person who owns property in la is never ever ever going to vote for a

19:47.040 --> 19:52.240
zoning reform that will allow giant apartment blocks to be built because it actually hurts

19:52.240 --> 19:57.760
their own bottom line so this is an instance where every single voter will always vote in

19:57.760 --> 20:05.920
their own interest but that interest destroys society and so so like nimbyism itself is is

20:05.920 --> 20:11.600
a problem unique to democracy right um it's the same thing with like prison reform nobody likes

20:11.600 --> 20:17.120
how american prisons are but no one ever actually votes to change them and no one ever wants a

20:17.120 --> 20:21.120
prison built in their backyard no one ever wants prisoners to be released into their community you

20:21.120 --> 20:27.920
know so so nimbyism like if you had a let's say a a benevolent philosopher king he would just build

20:27.920 --> 20:34.240
the apartment block and he would just build the prison as the society needed it you know and uh

20:34.240 --> 20:38.960
i don't know i feel like nimbyism is one of those things that would be changed even through

20:38.960 --> 20:43.440
democracy like i think that there are enough people that that it's plausible that there are

20:43.440 --> 20:48.640
enough people eventually who would want um who would be willing to make that sacrifice in their

20:48.640 --> 20:57.280
in their home like their property value going down uh just to fix the um the problem of people

20:57.280 --> 21:02.880
not having enough places to live uh like is that maybe we haven't seen it yet though you know

21:04.240 --> 21:08.000
i mean there's a little bit of a movement right like there's a little bit of a movement kind of

21:08.000 --> 21:14.080
starting up around it maybe maybe it might happen but i don't know like it's that's a tough one i

21:14.080 --> 21:23.680
mean another like if here do you do you want the ultimate black pill sure okay so when when trump

21:23.680 --> 21:31.600
was refusing to concede the election right yeah who was it who was it on the right that was

21:31.600 --> 21:45.360
actually standing up to trump uh pence um um pence did a little bit yeah and and to his credit

21:45.360 --> 21:54.080
to his credit but every single republican politician who who basically had their jobs

21:54.080 --> 21:59.840
on the line because they were being voted in and they knew how um how popular trump was they

21:59.840 --> 22:05.600
didn't say a single thing it was it was republican judges that looked into the cases and said no

22:05.600 --> 22:12.160
these have no merit it was um the attorney general whose position was appointed not elected you know

22:12.160 --> 22:18.000
it was the head of the fbi these are all positions that they don't need to worry about um public

22:18.000 --> 22:23.520
popularity and they were the ones that had the political space to oppose trump from the right

22:24.320 --> 22:31.600
and ultimately it was those guys who did their part in saving democracy the all the ones who

22:31.600 --> 22:35.920
who were in like unsafe seats and who had to get re-elected they didn't say a single thing

22:35.920 --> 22:41.920
you know yeah the ultimate black pill is that it was the anti-democratic elements of

22:42.640 --> 22:45.920
the american republic that saved democracy interesting

22:45.920 --> 22:55.600
and so i i think that's why like america has both democratic and autocratic elements because because

22:55.600 --> 23:00.000
you need both of them in some sense you need you need a component of your government that

23:00.000 --> 23:03.360
is outside the democratic process in order to be able to accurately judge it

23:05.600 --> 23:12.160
okay that makes sense couch man in the in the chat's been converted he now loves authoritarianism

23:12.240 --> 23:13.200
based nice

23:15.920 --> 23:19.680
yeah i guess that i guess i guess that's true yeah it was it was the

23:20.720 --> 23:24.640
okay that's that's interesting i feel like my brain isn't big enough for this but i think

23:24.640 --> 23:31.920
i'm getting what you're saying here i'll give you one final one final black pill hold on let me find

23:31.920 --> 23:38.560
this let me just pull this up real quick isn't something else taftage has sent me she's got a big

23:38.560 --> 23:42.800
brain she knows what's going on oh yeah she does yeah you've spoken to her before

23:45.040 --> 23:51.920
uh yeah yeah i have i like her a lot yeah it's funny like as soon as she went on destiny that

23:51.920 --> 23:57.040
first time i messaged her and i was like oh yeah you know you seem really cool and and then she

23:57.040 --> 24:01.040
like immediately follows me back on twitter and then fangirls out because apparently she's been

24:01.040 --> 24:08.800
watching me for years and i was like oh okay that's so base okay i'll i'll pull i'll give you

24:08.800 --> 24:14.800
this study here from cambridge testing theories of american politics elites interest groups and

24:14.800 --> 24:23.520
average citizens um so the tldr of this study is let me just let me just find that tldr the tldr

24:23.520 --> 24:30.960
the study is basically it's basically that the statistical correlation between

24:32.240 --> 24:38.400
how much money you make and whether or not the policies that you vote for actually get implemented

24:38.960 --> 24:44.880
goes up the more money you make and so when you have when you're in the lowest income bracket in

24:44.880 --> 24:52.240
the united states who you vote for basically doesn't matter and as your income goes up

24:53.120 --> 24:58.960
the more likely it is that the policies you want and that you vote for end up coming true

25:00.400 --> 25:05.040
which is a very interesting way to look at democracy is that you know if you if you are

25:05.040 --> 25:10.160
a very poor person and you vote for a candidate because he says he's going to do xyz the chances

25:10.160 --> 25:18.400
of him doing xyz is actually very low yeah okay there are ways to change that though right like

25:18.400 --> 25:27.520
from a local advocacy point right like a i don't know like you're right this study is right sure

25:27.520 --> 25:34.560
um i guess um i don't know what i'm getting at here i have no idea what i'm saying

25:35.360 --> 25:43.760
take the authoritarian pill stardust i don't think i i don't think i can just yeah but um i don't

25:43.760 --> 25:48.720
know god become god emperor trump and or biden whoever you want it's got to be a god emperor

25:48.720 --> 25:54.320
though i don't mind being god emperor you know but i just feel like i i still strongly believe

25:54.320 --> 26:01.040
in and advocating for people to get out and vote because because yeah the the i mean the less you

26:01.040 --> 26:06.720
vote the less it really does matter i guess like it i don't know i feel like it takes it takes two

26:06.720 --> 26:14.640
to tango right like we you can't expect um you can't expect your your hopes to be fulfilled when

26:14.640 --> 26:22.080
you can't even elect the people that want to um to help you achieve that goal yeah see so like

26:22.080 --> 26:27.040
at the end of it i'm still pro-democracy right i'm just i'm not i am i am kind of larping here i

26:27.040 --> 26:31.040
understand the other point of view but i am pro-democracy democracy you know it's just that i

26:31.040 --> 26:35.840
understand that democracy it can't be the the ultimate value it can't be the highest political

26:35.840 --> 26:40.880
value it has to be only a part of your political process sure what do you think the other values

26:40.880 --> 26:46.480
are oh well in the united states it's the constitution right the constitution the whole

26:46.480 --> 26:53.120
point of the constitution is that these are things that even if the population votes for them the

26:53.120 --> 27:00.320
government cannot do and so if you have that limit on democracy then you can at least rein in the

27:00.320 --> 27:05.840
excesses of the tyranny of the majority that's the that's the reason that your republic is set

27:05.840 --> 27:11.680
up the way that it is okay and you know there's there's it's more on the left than on the right

27:11.680 --> 27:16.480
because on the right you at least have the libertarians on the left they just do not give

27:16.480 --> 27:22.160
a shit about the constitution they're like any institution that stands in the way of us

27:22.160 --> 27:27.520
implementing our politics is an illegitimate institution and must be dismantled and overthrown

27:27.520 --> 27:32.000
and subverted because our politics are just that moral and righteous that's a lot of what the left

27:32.000 --> 27:39.040
says right now and that's insane like no there needs to be some limit on everyone's politics

27:40.080 --> 27:47.600
including yours you know i would agree with that yeah yeah so i i finally i and and you know the

27:47.600 --> 27:51.520
right does it too because the right has now gone on like this anti-democracy arc of their own

27:51.520 --> 27:56.720
because they lost an election right like um i think i mentioned in the fascism video i mentioned

27:56.720 --> 28:04.320
something along the lines of um fascists tend to as soon as an institution produces a result that

28:04.320 --> 28:10.320
they don't like they tend to completely delegitimize the institution they attack the rules of the game

28:10.320 --> 28:14.400
rather than accepting the fact that they lost the game you know yeah and you see fascists on the

28:14.400 --> 28:18.960
left do this and fascists on the right do this because fascism is neither left nor right yeah

28:18.960 --> 28:25.040
in the oh i hate it when also when i i hear like um leftists who try to say that like oh fascism

28:25.040 --> 28:35.040
is inherently right-wing and it's like well not um not really no no yeah um but yeah like the

28:36.400 --> 28:40.720
it's just the acceptance like i know americans they really harp on about democracy a lot how

28:40.720 --> 28:45.920
good it is and how moral it is and you know we're the country is like all this stuff but like there

28:45.920 --> 28:55.520
there's other parts of politics that also need their due respect i think you know i'm not an

28:55.520 --> 28:59.440
anarcho-capitalist i don't like the anarcho-capitalists i have read some of their

28:59.440 --> 29:04.480
stuff and the one political innovation that's actually good that comes from the anarcho-capitalists

29:05.040 --> 29:12.960
is when um hop i think i think he did it in democracy the god that failed hop said something

29:12.960 --> 29:21.840
like rights are inherently anti-democratic yeah you know what you're saying exactly that makes

29:21.840 --> 29:28.400
sense i get i get that makes sense yeah yeah you don't vote on rights yeah yeah the idea is that

29:28.400 --> 29:33.280
like you know if you own a house you have a right to it and if a hundred people walk into your house

29:33.280 --> 29:38.240
and vote themselves the owners of your house well no you own it your your right overrides their

29:38.240 --> 29:43.760
democracy and you have the right to remove them with force you know so if you have a right to a

29:43.760 --> 29:50.720
thing then the public's vote doesn't matter you know you know if you're if you have a right to

29:50.720 --> 29:54.400
be gay it doesn't matter if the majority doesn't want you to be gay you can do what you want in

29:54.400 --> 29:58.960
your private life you know so i think that's like the limit on that's a reasonable limit on

29:58.960 --> 30:08.880
democracy is the idea of rights um yeah it's we we just seem to be in like a dark time right now

30:08.880 --> 30:17.360
politically dark time what do you think the solution is um fuck the more that i look into

30:17.360 --> 30:23.600
it the more the solution is probably just going to be a fight you know like like if you look at

30:23.600 --> 30:30.800
like a fist fight or what no possibly a civil war in the united states i'm not gonna go i'm

30:30.800 --> 30:35.840
not going full tim pool on you here i think it's a far i think like it's it might happen in the next

30:35.840 --> 30:42.800
hundred years it might be a long time but like anytime you see tensions like this where you have

30:42.800 --> 30:47.520
two groups that just live in different realities they tend over the course of history they've

30:47.520 --> 30:53.520
always tended to just form their own nations you know like an east united states and a west united

30:53.520 --> 30:58.320
states there would be like the coasts and the interior or something like that you know they

30:58.320 --> 31:06.000
tend to like they tend to split up you know damn happens in the balkans east and west roman empire

31:06.000 --> 31:11.200
like pick a country and it happens the only place it doesn't really happen is china china has always

31:11.200 --> 31:16.880
had like massive wars of reunification they tend to stay together but like european history is

31:16.880 --> 31:22.480
always about the history of of ethnicities and peoples and nations breaking up because they just

31:22.480 --> 31:26.880
start living in different realities i wonder what that would look like i wonder if it was like the

31:26.880 --> 31:36.480
postal united states and then there would be like the i don't know in in inside or whatever i don't

31:36.480 --> 31:43.760
know what that would look like yeah i know um do you watch what if i'll test uh i don't what is that

31:44.800 --> 31:51.360
uh what if i'll test he is primarily a history youtuber but he's also got a big brain here

31:52.480 --> 32:02.800
let me find so he did he did a two-part video series where is it

32:05.520 --> 32:11.840
a two-part video series two months ago and it's called explaining america's nine nations it's

32:11.840 --> 32:16.240
a good it's a good it's like a two-hour watch it's a great watch oh shit he just goes really

32:16.320 --> 32:22.560
he goes yeah he goes into detail of basically these nine ethnicities that exist on the american

32:22.560 --> 32:28.240
continent and you've got like the caribbeans and you've got the midwesterners and you've got the

32:28.240 --> 32:33.680
people living on like the west coast you've got the the kobeckers the kobeckers you know

32:33.680 --> 32:39.440
the um the acadians that live in like the the northeast um northeast america and canada like

32:39.440 --> 32:45.280
and it's just these are the ethnic okay i'm using ethnic in a in a european sense um yeah

32:46.640 --> 32:52.560
like cultural traditions and habits the the differences between these nine these

32:52.560 --> 32:59.680
nine geographic locations in north america yeah and they i mean it might here's the thing like

33:00.320 --> 33:04.880
i don't want any sort of civil war i hope america like america has had some moments

33:04.880 --> 33:08.080
where it's been pre-divided and usually they can bring it back to the center and like

33:08.080 --> 33:12.400
hold on right i hope that happens again but it might not you know who who knows what the

33:12.400 --> 33:22.480
future is going to bring who knows yeah wow but he he's a great channel he does so much

33:22.480 --> 33:28.800
good stuff and he's um he is like a center right-leaning kind of guy and and sometimes

33:28.800 --> 33:36.400
that comes through but he tends to focus mainly on just history and so he's i highly recommend

33:36.560 --> 33:44.080
stuff yeah i'll take a look at his stuff it's super cool i know he uh he he debated vosh

33:44.080 --> 33:50.880
like maybe six months ago or so and like he would have absolutely dumpstered vosh but

33:50.880 --> 33:58.240
but he has no charisma and vosh is all charisma yeah so like clearly what if alt-hist had the

33:58.240 --> 34:04.960
knowledge to just run circles around vosh but he didn't know how to say it and vosh just basically

34:04.960 --> 34:09.600
went like squeaked through on the fumes it was a really funny debate to watch though

34:09.600 --> 34:16.080
i i think it's interesting um i've noticed in these debates now that you can prepare a lot you

34:16.080 --> 34:22.240
can know everything about a subject but if you know how to kind of work the conversation i feel

34:22.240 --> 34:27.520
like you can know next to nothing about a subject and still make the other person look like an

34:27.520 --> 34:33.840
idiot basically oh yeah fucking terrible and it's and it's and i feel like i've used it to

34:33.840 --> 34:41.840
my advantage a couple of times and i feel a little bit bad about it so yeah um i know like

34:41.840 --> 34:46.320
like back in 2017 the alt-right was learning that the whole the hard way because you had like the

34:46.320 --> 34:51.600
you had like um you know the warski show warski live or whatever it was you had tonka's show and

34:51.600 --> 34:56.480
stuff and they all just got by in charisma and it worked for a while but eventually you know reality

34:56.480 --> 35:02.640
snaps back and they all got they all fell apart because i know um destiny debated them a bunch

35:02.640 --> 35:06.560
sargon debated them a bunch and they all just kind of crumbled you know because eventually

35:06.560 --> 35:11.920
that that stops working eventually people kind of figure it out eventually yeah yeah there's a guy

35:11.920 --> 35:17.600
in the in your chat i think his name is elective tool he said that this guy this guy is sus i bet

35:17.600 --> 35:25.360
i know his his idea on ukraine what do you think my idea on ukraine is dude yeah what is your idea

35:25.440 --> 35:32.080
on ukraine i mean i'm i'm pro ukraine obviously yeah yeah i mean some people think that i'm like

35:33.120 --> 35:38.080
oh god i mean it's because of the friends that i have right but like i'm not like a pro russia

35:38.080 --> 35:41.520
simp that some of the people on the right seem to be like they that's that's fucking insane

35:41.520 --> 35:48.320
that shit is weird to me like uh talk about they're siding with like like russia and and

35:48.960 --> 35:52.480
i don't know they're buying up like russia and china talking points and it's like

35:53.120 --> 36:00.160
bro you don't like china is the communist or they were the communists like you know this like what

36:00.160 --> 36:04.960
are you doing why are you why are you backing the guy who wants to bring the ussr back again i mean

36:04.960 --> 36:09.680
i don't know if he actually does but like you know like that's kind of what they're known for there

36:09.680 --> 36:16.080
you you guys are literally backing them like you know what's going on there's a few reasons for

36:16.160 --> 36:21.440
that um do you watch kraut's videos you know kraut is uh yeah i love kraut i used to watch

36:21.440 --> 36:30.720
um his a lot of his videos actually um he just did a video on um on the political ideology of

36:30.720 --> 36:37.760
putin's russia another hour-long video but it's amazing it's great um actually he used he i know

36:37.760 --> 36:42.720
that he watched and critiqued my uh my fascism video and he actually got my reading list and

36:42.720 --> 36:46.720
he used some of his some of my books for his video so that's that was actually pretty cool

36:46.720 --> 36:56.560
to see um yeah but he um he goes basically into it's two russian fascists and then one

36:56.560 --> 37:02.080
german and their political basically their political science writing and how these three

37:02.080 --> 37:06.960
guys basically have influenced putin's putin's outlook on life and on politics

37:07.840 --> 37:16.720
um and and basically when you see people when you see like western rightists they're simping

37:16.720 --> 37:22.080
for russia and simping for putin their their view is some of it's going to be religious

37:22.720 --> 37:31.840
because they they see the west as this decadent globohomo lgbtq rainbow capitalist nightmare

37:32.800 --> 37:39.680
and it's and the only place that is um pushing forward traditional values

37:40.320 --> 37:45.760
and and christian values is russia and the russian orthodox church and so this is the

37:45.760 --> 37:50.800
only christianity we can get in politics we'll take it so some of them are siding with russia

37:50.800 --> 37:56.480
for religious reasons um some of them are siding with russia because so so in this case this is

37:56.480 --> 38:01.200
like the paul joseph watson's if you go over to his channel he has a video he made in the past

38:01.200 --> 38:08.560
few months called like the end of the liberal world order or something like that and and what

38:08.560 --> 38:12.960
these guys believe when they say liberal world order what they're talking about is like uh free

38:12.960 --> 38:19.600
trade and you know just just the idea that the neo lib idea that like if you liberalize markets it

38:19.600 --> 38:24.560
liberalizes politics which to be fair has actually failed at this point um the germans were buying

38:24.560 --> 38:29.360
oil from the russians hoping that that the russians liberalizing their market would also

38:29.360 --> 38:34.160
liberalize russian politics and it did not you know americans have been buying cheap shit from

38:34.160 --> 38:40.880
china for 25 years because clinton and bush both believed that if china opened up its markets it

38:40.880 --> 38:46.960
would liberalize their politics and it didn't so the neo libs were wrong on that um but there's

38:47.760 --> 38:53.680
the they'll also call it like the rules based world order and basically these are guys that

38:53.680 --> 39:01.200
want to see that collapsed and pulled apart as part of dismantling liberal hegemony because

39:01.200 --> 39:06.480
they want to return to a more conservative way of viewing the world and and of doing politics

39:06.480 --> 39:12.160
are more like insular we don't interfere in each of those countries anymore so we're dismantling

39:12.160 --> 39:17.840
nato we're dismantling all these global alliances and everyone just stays in their lane i did call

39:17.840 --> 39:24.400
bush a neo lib because bush was actually a neo lib the neo cons are neo libs yeah interesting

39:24.400 --> 39:30.160
okay these economically i mean economically they are um so so you have guys like paul just

39:30.160 --> 39:37.280
watson who are like listen if we want to challenge the the western liberal stranglehold on politics

39:37.280 --> 39:43.840
and the western and the dominant western liberal block we need somebody who's willing to show that

39:43.920 --> 39:48.480
all of the rules are just they're just a sham they're they're a paper tiger

39:48.480 --> 39:54.560
so they want russia to win and in fact these people have basically been completely btfo'd

39:54.560 --> 39:59.120
by the fact that ukraine has been winning the war they these are people who thought that the

39:59.120 --> 40:04.720
war would be over in two weeks um so you have like the political reason you have the religious reason

40:04.720 --> 40:11.360
and then you just have the fact that the russians are are basically like a new a new variant of

40:11.360 --> 40:17.360
neo-fascist and then you have a bunch of post fascists in in the in the west and they're

40:17.360 --> 40:22.400
basically just siding with them for that reason and so those are the three main reasons why you

40:22.400 --> 40:26.560
see a lot of people on the right supporting russia and then there's like a fourth one and

40:26.560 --> 40:31.600
the fourth one is like conspiracy laden where they just they just don't trust the west's

40:31.600 --> 40:37.120
interpretation and you know to be fair the west has done some weird shit with propaganda as well

40:37.120 --> 40:42.240
like we're not innocent of this so i i get it right you know you always have the cia overthrowing

40:42.240 --> 40:47.520
governments in like the third world and you know people lying about this or that like you've seen

40:47.520 --> 40:53.760
that in our history so they're basically saying hey what if all of the liberal history we've been

40:53.760 --> 41:00.000
taught is just propaganda and so now they're like this is this is like for example what like aden

41:00.000 --> 41:06.240
paladin thinks um on the right where like it where the entire narrative about ukraine cannot

41:06.240 --> 41:11.360
be trusted because we've all seen it filtered through an american lens and the americans aren't

41:11.360 --> 41:21.040
impartial yeah aden paladin is a um is i just talked to her recently i was really surprised

41:21.040 --> 41:27.920
to hear that she's a monarchist um yes she's a libertarian monarchist actually yeah yeah that

41:27.920 --> 41:35.680
was really which is a ridiculous idea idea yeah libertarian almost kind of like it

41:37.120 --> 41:41.760
monarchist like man i i don't i'm i'm still wrapping my head around that one

41:42.640 --> 41:47.520
yeah yeah she's really into patriarchal stuff she really likes the patriarchal

41:47.520 --> 41:53.280
you know uh aspect of of like a religious kind of like monarchy or something like that

41:54.240 --> 41:58.000
i mean i i hate to say it but i think part of that might just be sexual with her

41:58.000 --> 42:04.320
um but i know part of it for sure yeah yeah you know i don't want to go too hard because

42:04.320 --> 42:10.800
aden and i have had like it recently had a big fight oh okay yeah she basically whatever you

42:10.800 --> 42:17.600
want to say well the tldr is that she she leaked my dms and i don't take that kindly so i i've

42:17.600 --> 42:22.400
stopped associated she there's nothing like bad in them because i don't say bad things but i still

42:22.400 --> 42:25.840
think it's like a breach of privacy so i was like you know what maybe you and i shouldn't

42:25.840 --> 42:31.200
talk anymore you know um yeah but in terms of ideology the whole libertarian monarchist thing

42:31.200 --> 42:39.040
is basically that she believes that government is a corporation and so to best run government

42:39.040 --> 42:42.720
you should structure it like it's a corporation like it's privately owned so you have a monarch

42:42.720 --> 42:50.000
who is like a president or a ceo someone who owns the company and then the landed aristocracy they're

42:50.000 --> 42:56.160
like your middle managers and then your serfs are your employees and so the reason that she believes

42:56.160 --> 43:03.040
that this makes sense is because someone who owns the company is not incentivized to destroy their

43:03.040 --> 43:07.840
own company because they own it they generate wealth from it they care about it it's their

43:07.840 --> 43:13.760
creation meanwhile an elected president can go into an office fuck it up for four years

43:14.400 --> 43:20.640
you know his his his his um the next guy in line will will pardon him for any of his crimes then

43:20.640 --> 43:25.680
he goes on to live a private life he gets a book deal you know he gets he gets he gets to go on tv

43:25.680 --> 43:29.600
talk about how how he did these great things for four years as he fucked your country up

43:30.400 --> 43:38.160
and so the the american presidential system means that individual bad actors have no accountability

43:38.160 --> 43:45.360
if they come into power but in the libertarian monarchist system you are at least incentivized

43:45.360 --> 43:50.400
to maintain the social structure because you are enriching yourself through it

43:51.440 --> 43:59.040
now this is a retarded idea but i can see her point of view yeah i can at least see her point

43:59.040 --> 44:08.000
of view oh hey pangas what's up man i guess i think you want pangas watches me and destiny

44:08.000 --> 44:17.840
i think both of us oh cool so yeah yeah um i don't know how okay yeah i guess

44:19.040 --> 44:24.880
dude i'm i'm just sorry about ranting so much no it's cool it's cool um i guess i don't know

44:24.880 --> 44:30.720
how you can have a real like a libertarian monarchy with like a religious monarchy though

44:30.720 --> 44:35.680
i just don't i just don't get it don't um i have to think about it some more

44:40.000 --> 44:45.280
to be fair to her um she's come to religion recently and mainly out of her knowledge of

44:45.280 --> 44:49.680
psychology because she's very well educated on psychology she has i think a master's degree in

44:49.680 --> 44:57.200
psych yeah um she knows her stuff for sure so i i think a lot of a lot of her religious her

44:57.200 --> 45:03.840
a lot of her recent religious experiences has been grounded in in psych to be fair that's how

45:03.840 --> 45:07.280
a lot of people nowadays are get are getting to religions generally through psychology you know

45:07.280 --> 45:10.880
they're they're reaching some limits of their own mind and and of their own they're like they're

45:10.880 --> 45:14.480
starting to think about like oh well why are we this way and you know why do we think like this

45:14.800 --> 45:21.040
why do we have these effects you know yeah um i think a lot of them come to religion because

45:21.040 --> 45:25.200
they're you know psychology kind of leads them there i i don't fully understand that

45:25.200 --> 45:30.000
myself because i'm an atheist yeah i i i need to look into this at some point i've been reading

45:30.000 --> 45:37.840
some some psychology i i i took like intro to psych and then abnormal psych like 10 to 15 years

45:37.840 --> 45:44.000
ago it's been a long time since i've been in school yeah um that's hens hops taking a nutshell

45:44.000 --> 45:52.800
yeah yeah it is um hans herman hop he's the anacap guy okay okay um yeah i i don't know um much about

45:52.800 --> 45:59.440
psychology um i guess one thing that i found interesting in in the psych world or whatever

45:59.440 --> 46:05.520
or like the pseudo psych world is all all of these like youtube body language uh analyzers

46:05.520 --> 46:09.440
have you found that weird because i find that shit really weird i actually don't know what

46:09.440 --> 46:14.080
you're talking about oh yeah there are all these like youtubers who are like body language

46:14.080 --> 46:22.240
analyzers and they try to tell you everything about somebody um based on like based based on

46:22.240 --> 46:26.640
like uh the body language that they display during an interview or something like that

46:26.640 --> 46:30.320
and they'll like over analyze it and it's super cringe in my opinion

46:30.320 --> 46:37.520
i mean there's probably something to it you can definitely see like oh if you know if you sit

46:37.520 --> 46:41.760
this way or you use your hands in this way like there's probably something there but i can see how

46:41.760 --> 46:46.240
like all that stuff can also be faked if you're smart enough right so who actually knows you know

46:49.280 --> 46:56.560
the issue is that i think when it comes to deception versus intuition the the perfect

46:56.560 --> 47:01.280
i don't know deceptionist will always beat the perfect intuitionist in a lot of sense in a lot

47:01.280 --> 47:06.880
of senses because you can always fake a thing and you can always fake it just as well as it can be

47:06.880 --> 47:14.720
real when it comes to body language or how you speak how you lie you know so i think i i there's

47:14.720 --> 47:18.960
probably something there but it's probably not like it's probably not anything that's universal

47:18.960 --> 47:23.280
you know i'm sure a lot of it is just youtube nonsense because there's so much youtube nonsense

47:23.280 --> 47:34.880
out there yeah actually that reminds me um when you were reacting to the um my fascism video

47:36.000 --> 47:43.600
you i got to the part where i talked about the guy who said that that socialists should have sex with

47:43.600 --> 47:48.400
children as a form of anti-fascism and you you kind of lost your mind a bit do you remember that

47:49.280 --> 47:53.760
i don't remember what i said there but no what like what do you what happened i recall

47:54.560 --> 48:00.240
or what do you recall i guess so the um well just that you you thought it was insane and you were

48:00.240 --> 48:06.400
just like you're incredulous but but basically the idea was um you've got wilhelm reich who

48:06.400 --> 48:10.960
wrote the mass psychology of fascism he was a socialist also a german psych psychoanalyst

48:11.520 --> 48:18.240
and his view was that um sexual repression is what causes people to vote

48:18.240 --> 48:23.040
fascist if they grow up in a sexually repressive society if they themselves are sexually repressed

48:23.040 --> 48:28.640
then they're going if their politics will lean fascist these are one of the people that you that

48:28.640 --> 48:34.320
that weren't fascists that wrote about fascism right yes yes okay all right makes a lot of sense

48:34.320 --> 48:41.040
yeah and so his his view was because he like wrote in like the the prime age of freud's he

48:41.040 --> 48:46.560
was very freudian right oh really okay yeah so it was all about sex it was all it's always about

48:46.560 --> 48:54.000
sex with freud so he was he was basically talking about um how if we you know part of the socialist

48:54.000 --> 48:59.680
project has to be a loosening of traditional sexual morality to be more inclusive and that

48:59.680 --> 49:05.120
will combat fascism but then and i mean maybe there's something to that maybe there's not who

49:05.120 --> 49:11.200
knows right but then continuing from his work was the italian communist mario mielli and he

49:12.000 --> 49:20.080
continued on by saying oh yeah so he that guy was so correct that um we should actually have sex

49:20.080 --> 49:28.560
with children because if we have sex with children it will create in them a form of sexuality that is

49:28.560 --> 49:37.200
so open that they can never become fascists and he basically said that if you are a gay man

49:37.760 --> 49:42.080
you must also be a pedophile for the good of the socialist project

49:44.240 --> 49:47.120
i don't know i feel like this dude was just trying to take advantage of like

49:47.920 --> 49:54.400
of what he can get do some such shit that's what i think honestly yes yeah obviously right yeah

49:54.400 --> 50:02.240
like he he wrote this whole like 90 page manifesto on like the communist politics of italy and and

50:02.240 --> 50:07.280
how like and how and how in order to prevent fascism from ever coming to power again in italy

50:07.280 --> 50:11.040
you had to do certain things sexually with children like it was a whole big fucking thing

50:12.800 --> 50:21.280
it's it's it was extremely ridiculous some of the things that he wrote about but holy fuck um

50:21.280 --> 50:28.000
the one thing that i didn't mention in the video one thing because it was too spicy it was too

50:28.000 --> 50:37.760
spicy yeah is that uh i know vosh swears by wilhelm reich in the mass psychology of fascism

50:38.480 --> 50:43.040
and i don't know if he knows if if mario mielli like spun off from his work

50:43.680 --> 50:50.240
yeah but you know that's that's just another point on the vosh sus list somebody's getting

50:50.240 --> 50:55.040
longer and longer somebody should tell him maybe you should like be like yo do you know about this

50:55.040 --> 51:01.920
like i don't know if you want to be associated with this guy like well to be fair vosh vosh

51:01.920 --> 51:06.400
thinks i'm a fascist and he won't talk to me so oh really oh okay i don't know what vosh thinks

51:06.400 --> 51:12.800
about me anymore i know that he liked talking to me at some point um and he would like possibly

51:12.800 --> 51:18.800
pop into my streams uh pretty often and he would like talk to me every now and then but um i don't

51:18.800 --> 51:25.840
know i think yeah i think because i'm like friendly with like pretty much everybody um

51:26.400 --> 51:32.080
i don't know i think he's a little bit sus of me though yeah yeah i think i think the the the

51:32.080 --> 51:40.640
destiny fault line went right through all you lefty tubers and you and rose wrist and econoboi

51:40.640 --> 51:46.000
and all all these people have ended up on the destiny side of the uh of the earthquake you know

51:46.560 --> 51:52.240
yeah damn i mean to be fair econobo is also really smart i've spoken to him too and he's

51:52.240 --> 51:58.320
actually a pretty smart guy econobo is so smart yeah he is so smart he and i went back and forth

51:58.320 --> 52:04.640
on about um about student loan debt forgiveness in the states and i said that it might be a

52:04.640 --> 52:08.880
good idea but it's probably the wrong time to do it because it seems like it's a massive wealth

52:08.880 --> 52:13.600
transfer from the um the lower class to the middle class so maybe not a good idea right

52:13.600 --> 52:17.440
now because things are already pretty heated up in the american economy what did you think of that

52:17.440 --> 52:24.480
of that policy i think um i think the way that that they are doing it seems pretty effective

52:24.480 --> 52:29.200
like they're targeting specifically people who had pell grants right um those are going to be

52:29.200 --> 52:36.960
people who probably need uh that relief the most so yes it is like a massive um transfer of wealth

52:36.960 --> 52:45.600
i guess um but but it is it's alleviating things for like the people who need it the most and i

52:45.600 --> 52:55.200
think i'm kind of okay with that but um yeah so so my argument against it was that you know if

52:55.200 --> 53:00.240
the the libertarians seem to correctly say that if you print money you get inflation like those

53:00.240 --> 53:04.240
are there's a correlation there you know yeah now there are some ways in which you can print money

53:04.240 --> 53:09.600
that won't cause inflation um but that's like responsible money printing and sometimes the fed

53:09.600 --> 53:13.040
is not so responsible it all always depends on what's going there's a bunch of different factors

53:13.040 --> 53:20.720
here right so because you know for example if you wanted to start a business and if if money

53:20.720 --> 53:25.120
and production are kind of like these two variables that you want to keep in line

53:25.920 --> 53:29.360
if you print a bunch of money but don't increase production you've just caused inflation

53:29.360 --> 53:34.880
but if you print money and then give that money out in terms of grants to people who can now start

53:34.880 --> 53:38.640
businesses that wouldn't be able to start them well now they're more productive so production

53:38.640 --> 53:42.400
actually goes up so there's ways to print money that actually also increases production so you

53:42.400 --> 53:46.960
don't actually get inflation out of printing money it's possible um just you have to be really

53:46.960 --> 53:54.800
responsible about it but if you print money to forgive debt what ends up happening is that you

53:54.800 --> 53:58.080
have a bunch of middle class people who hold the debt because they're they're the students who have

53:58.080 --> 54:01.680
gone to college and a college degree means you're going to make more money than people who don't go

54:01.680 --> 54:06.560
to college generally speaking so you have this this middle class group of students who get their

54:06.560 --> 54:12.720
debt forgiven and you're printing money to do it so the rich don't care because one the rich hold

54:12.720 --> 54:16.880
not wealth but assets so they don't have like liquid money that's being devalued in their

54:16.880 --> 54:21.040
bank accounts they have buildings and property and whatever um but even if they do they don't

54:21.040 --> 54:27.360
care they're rich like who cares if food prices go up right but for the poor the absolute poorest of

54:27.360 --> 54:31.920
the poor they might only have like 10 20 100 bucks in their account or something the guys

54:31.920 --> 54:37.520
live in paycheck to paycheck well now everything's more expensive for them um and so if you're

54:37.520 --> 54:43.840
printing money to give to the middle class that seems to be siphoning meaningful wealth directly

54:43.840 --> 54:50.880
out of the lower class to do it um and in my opinion it just seems to not have been the right

54:50.880 --> 54:57.040
time to do that policy considering all the other stimulus biden had done you know because there's

54:57.280 --> 55:01.920
so much stimulus you can do at one point at one point in time before it starts causing inflation

55:01.920 --> 55:05.920
you know maybe i should have waited a bit i mean i'm sure he did it just to try to win the midterms

55:05.920 --> 55:09.520
right so i mean there's a political reason too well kind of boy did make a good point though

55:09.520 --> 55:15.760
that like for for what we're experiencing he like did a breakdown of like the percentages right of

55:15.760 --> 55:20.960
like how much something is contributing to inflation and like um how much stimulus was

55:20.960 --> 55:25.840
was contributing to inflation all of this right and he and he basically made a breakdown he

55:25.840 --> 55:30.320
basically made the argument that whatever inflation we are incurring from these um

55:30.880 --> 55:39.680
from from these um policies or these these things that biden is uh like passing um it's worth it

55:39.680 --> 55:45.440
because what we're getting in return is so much more is essentially what he's been saying um

55:45.440 --> 55:48.720
i don't know if he's done that for the student loan thing i think he did it for the uh

55:48.720 --> 55:55.840
uh the the covid stimulus probably yeah the code stimulus yeah yeah yeah i i and here's the thing

55:55.840 --> 56:00.480
i i did a similar video um i just called it bidenflation with a bunch of meme symbols in

56:00.480 --> 56:04.960
it because it was kind of fun i know my audience got mad at me for it but i did a similar analysis

56:04.960 --> 56:09.600
we probably used the same um the same report that came out because there was a report that came out

56:09.600 --> 56:13.840
like at the start of the year about how much money biden had spent on stimulus so we probably covered

56:13.840 --> 56:21.360
the same thing but the idea was basically like um if inflation is eight percent we can attribute

56:21.360 --> 56:27.760
maybe two percent of that to the war in ukraine we can attribute one to two percent of that at

56:27.760 --> 56:32.240
uh background inflation which is normal and then we can attribute four percent of that to um

56:33.120 --> 56:38.880
to biden stimulus and so if you have four percent as actually the result of biden printing money to

56:38.880 --> 56:45.600
give out to people to try and keep the economy afloat during covid um well then what did you

56:45.600 --> 56:50.960
get for that four percent inflation and you could say like well we save so many jobs and we you know

56:50.960 --> 56:55.920
so many people had certain debts relieved and so many people were able to like you know um

56:55.920 --> 57:00.400
keep their keep their heads above water when they had no money and so maybe you can say that four

57:00.400 --> 57:03.920
percent inflation is worth that and there's an argument to be made on the numbers there

57:03.920 --> 57:10.080
you know how much did you get and is four percent inflation worth it um but i think the right wing

57:10.880 --> 57:17.200
accurately points out that a lot of that inflation happened because of the lockdowns anyway

57:17.200 --> 57:22.720
and now the right doesn't care about the negative effects of covid right they some of them don't

57:22.720 --> 57:26.880
believe that they're it's real some of them say it's not that bad some of them say you know what

57:26.880 --> 57:31.120
our personal liberties are more important and you shouldn't have locked us down that's probably the

57:31.120 --> 57:35.200
most reasonable argument on the right is that you know this wasn't worth what we paid for it

57:35.200 --> 57:39.440
you shouldn't have locked us down okay fair enough we can accept that um just for argument's sake we

57:39.440 --> 57:45.440
can accept it so yeah they're going to say hey listen biden you don't get credit for keeping

57:45.440 --> 57:50.480
people afloat when it was government action that put their heads below water anyway and i think

57:50.480 --> 57:56.240
that's a fair criticism okay yeah yeah if that's the case i can definitely see their their argument

57:56.240 --> 58:04.800
there um yeah i don't know um the the thing though is that they're wrong but yeah um like

58:04.800 --> 58:13.920
that's you know yeah maybe maybe like explain you know if you lock down and then that destroys

58:13.920 --> 58:18.160
businesses and destroys jobs and destroys industries well then you have to ask well

58:18.160 --> 58:22.320
was the lockdown worth it was the amount of locking down that you did worth the economic

58:22.320 --> 58:28.640
damage that you incurred and if the answer is no well then you can't really give biden the credit

58:28.640 --> 58:34.080
for saying well i offset it by printing a bunch of money and giving it to you it's like well

58:34.880 --> 58:40.880
that was kind of a band-aid though like i don't know if america would have been better off if you

58:40.880 --> 58:48.000
had more infections more deaths but more freedom that's a hard question to answer you know maybe

58:48.000 --> 58:52.560
maybe i don't know that it would be because i think our already our medical facilities were

58:52.560 --> 58:59.760
like um pretty swamped i had friends who worked in the medical industry um just with the way that

58:59.760 --> 59:05.680
it was with with the lockdowns that we had um medical professionals have been like retiring

59:05.680 --> 59:12.320
left and right um and i had friends who were nurses who were experiencing so much more death

59:12.320 --> 59:20.400
than they were used to um so i think that that was a huge strain on that industry and i think

59:20.400 --> 59:24.640
that industry is going to be recovering for a really long time and if it had been any worse

59:24.640 --> 59:32.640
i'm not really sure what uh would have happened i guess to that industry you know that's fair but

59:32.640 --> 59:37.520
at the same time you know i live in canada where we had a much more strict lockdown than you guys

59:37.520 --> 59:42.480
did in the states and we experienced all that stuff too we have nurse burnout we have we have

59:42.480 --> 59:49.360
deaths we have businesses that have been destroyed you know um we had a trucker protest which is you

59:49.360 --> 59:53.600
know that you know rebelling against the government might be a normal occurrence in the united states

59:53.600 --> 01:00:01.360
that never happens here like that was a once in in a generation event here in canada um so like

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:08.160
it see it may be the case that locking down prevented some catastrophe but i feel like

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.760
like you really have to lock down to prevent all the catastrophe like china has gone full

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:19.360
authoritarian mode destroying everything in their path and it hasn't helped that much you know what

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:26.320
i mean so i think there's there's like there's diminishing returns on lockdowns and it may be the

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:33.040
case that some people on the left went too far or advocated going too far despite the cost that

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.480
they would have paid otherwise you know what i mean like it seems like there was no good answer here

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.480
yeah it's really hard to say like you're right it's um it's it's really hard to say

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.720
how things would have been different when we didn't do those things i guess

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.040
so in the chat says we should have done the florida protocol for the entire uia

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.840
us where old people were kept inside and young people were able to be out and about

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.280
i mean maybe because young people weren't like affected that much by covid in the end it was all

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.440
old people you know so maybe maybe and then here's the other here's the other side of the

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.440
conversation we never fully locked down like we were supposed to if we had done it right it would

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.960
have been worth it without question are you sure about that though because early in the pandemic

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.560
you saw like chinese people being welded into their apartment blocks and you had like soldiers

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.080
on the street blasting like cleaners everywhere on the roads and and like people getting arrested

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:34.000
for going outside like you want like a full fully locked down where no one moves no one goes to

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.240
work like everything shuts down i don't think that would have been worth it like you have yeah well

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:47.120
them giga like if you want to see what a full a true lockdown is you can look at china and

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.160
like that was insane like that was nuts yeah that is and i think they're still they're still doing

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.240
they're still doing their like zero covid policy i believe like or at least i saw like a couple

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.640
of months ago like people were getting like transported to different facilities that they

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:11.440
tested positive for uh for covid and that shit's fucking crazy yep yeah so like it seems like there

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.120
was just no good answer here it was like either lots of people die and you have your freedom or

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.880
like you have varying restrictions that get more and more draconian

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.680
yeah you can walk down people without going so far as to people in their homes no you can't

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.480
because people are going to go outside they want to you know uh china's still welding people into

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.520
their apartments apparently i i was not aware of that but they apparently like they have some weird

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.080
i don't know i don't know if this is true or not because this could just be chinese like propaganda

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.800
or whatever but they were talking about they have this uh this this cool like grocery app and you

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.200
can get gross groceries delivered to you or whatever and i don't know how how real that is

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.600
you know so yeah well i mean we have like instacart over here and stuff so yeah maybe right maybe

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:05.440
no i've seen a lot of um did you see oh fuck so i do a podcast with lilith lovett if you know who

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:12.480
that is i don't know uh sorry she's this whole space she's um she's she's a trans porn actress

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:20.160
okay but she's but she's chinese she's from taiwan um and so we we did a video um on china maybe two

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.400
or three weeks ago no i was i was sick back then it was longer than that we did something

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:30.880
and we did just what what was happening in china and we watched a bunch of videos and she

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:37.040
translated and there was like people who were stuck in apartment blocks in shanghai who were

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.600
just starving in their apartments and they were all like hanging out their windows on their

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.680
balconies um like yelling stuff like we're starving we're dying in here and then like

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.600
a government drone flew in and like on loudspeaker on the drone told them all to shut up

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.360
and it was like this is like this is the dystopian cyberpunk future you know yeah

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.240
wow oh panga sent you a video of the apartments if you want to see it

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:15.040
um i think i have to get going though at this point just take a look let me see did you send

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.240

i'm sorry i didn't have a whole lot to say i feel like um there's like a i'm sorry i'm sorry for

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:30.640
dominating the conversation no it's cool i i i uh it was interesting for sure let me see oh you know

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.480
little translate because i didn't know what was going on like you know i spent some time in china

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.400
like 15 years ago i used to know like basic comp it's all gone i've it's it's amazing how as you

okay i'm addicted to it it's terrible that's your factorial huh yeah pretty much yeah

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.560
oh why did it freeze

i do gotta take off pretty much now but i'm gonna send you one more thing before i go

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.960
okay just find it here i autistically save like everything for videos and streams

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.560
i was going to my china file for a minute the zenshine nine says china was so extreme

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.680
there should be a middle ground somewhere at least we should not have had politicians lying to us

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.040
saying it was all a planned world unleashed pandemic or that dems made it happen on purpose

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:55.360
that would have been nice yeah that would have been nice uh i mean i i understand like the

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:05.280
the anger about some of the um uh what's what i'm trying to say here there's anger about

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:14.480
how people seem to be very hypocritical about who gets to say what you know like if you said that

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:23.280
if you said that this was a lab leak you know in 2020 or 2021 you'd be banned off social media you

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:30.240
were called like a nazi conspiracy theorist alex jones watcher and until john stewart said it on

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.720
his show and then it's like oh why is he allowed to say it now you know and now you have people in

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.560
congress saying i was like well come on guys like there was so much double standards on what you

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.160
were allowed to say whether or not it was correct like maybe it would have been all just conspiracy

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.480
theory but people shouldn't have been like kicked out of the internet for saying it i think i think

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.560
the issue is that when the original the original person who talked about it being a lab leak was

01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.320
not talking about it being a a malicious lab leak right the person who was initially saying that it

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:06.640
was it could have been a leak from from one of the labs was saying that basically they were known um

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.880
for for going into bat caves without the proper gear and they were known for not wearing the

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:18.880
proper gear when taking samples from different places and that um and that it may have been a

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:27.040
leak um through i guess just just over exposure and and you know not enough protective gear right

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:34.320
i think that's what it was basically so it was like a negligence leak and not not like a man-made

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:40.560
virus that was leaked out into the world it was just they were doing testing on um on these

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:47.040
different caves and these different areas and uh and probably were not um following the safest

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:53.120
protocol um but i think i think there's a huge difference between saying that and then saying

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:59.760
that like it was man-made the cdc funded the you know funded it the cdc funded it and created it

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.320
and unleashed it upon us and all of that right i think there's a huge difference

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:10.320
yeah yeah i completely agree with you i think that there's like there's a shredding of social

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.360
trust when it comes to what you're allowed to say online right now like for example on unlike

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:23.520
on right-wing twitter you can see like a 10-minute collage of people who are democratic party members

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.880
and like elected people even biden and hillary um this 10-minute collage of them openly saying

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.720
that donald trump didn't win 2016 and it's like well jesus christ we've been talking about how

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.760
dangerous it is to how dangerous it is to democracy to deny the 2020 election what have

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:46.400
you guys been doing for four fucking years you know like on the right there's this deep sense

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.200
that everything is just hypocritical right now and that people aren't playing by the same rules

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.000
and it's like what the fuck so like yeah i don't fully agree with them but i get where they're

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.200
coming from i understand where they're coming from but again like hillary didn't take a whole

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:07.840
long time to concede she she conceded the next day yeah you know so yeah she conceded the next day

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.120
um and you know whether or not she said well i won the popular vote well the popular vote doesn't

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.920
really matter right like we know the way that the election works um well i i think i think one of

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.400
the clips though was like in 2018 where she's like donald trump is an illegitimate president

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.040
she's like outright says like jesus christ like come on that's a bit irresponsible yeah yeah

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.640
stupid for her to say that yeah i think i might do a video on that because i do know at least some

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.880
people on the on the center left watch me so i want to i want to like expose both sides to what

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.640
they're missing you know what i mean that's kind of been my goal from the channel recently sure

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.680
i think that i think that's a you know really fair thing to say and i'm willing to concede that like

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.680
you know she's said things that maybe she shouldn't have said there are things that

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.520
democratic candidates have said that they shouldn't have said but like when it comes

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:59.840
down to the actual actions at least she conceded the next day at least she didn't um uh end up

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.760
suing like you know trying to sue a whole bunch of states and and stirring up a whole bunch of

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:13.760
um people who who honestly feel like um the rug was pulled from under them and

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:23.280
honestly you know feel like they have to fight you know the government basically right like i

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.560
feel like at least she didn't do that i feel like there's a there's still a difference in like the

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:34.880
amount of of extremes that both sides are going to i don't know no i agree i agree with you yeah

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:42.880
in the end you know there's something that you say two years later on cnn to rile your base

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.920
up and then there's what you actually file in court those are two different things for sure

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:52.640
yeah and and you know also just regarding the whole russian thing like i kind of um i kind of

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.040
side with like what julia yafi has said on it um and she said that basically like the russian uh

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:07.280
like the fsb um them finding what they found like with the emails or whatever um was kind of

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.760
like a fluke accident right it wasn't like they were trying to make hillary lose the election

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:21.120
they they weren't sure like how how effective they would be um in in hurting her campaign

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:27.600
um but it ended up like it was like they she describes it as like when you're trying to like

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:35.280
uh push push a bully back right or push a bully and you're trying to like um you're trying to

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.160
show them who's you know that you're like you can push them around a little bit but then you end up

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.400
accidentally pushing them a you know just a little bit the wrong way and they end up like breaking

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.560
their nose you never meant to break their nose right like they fall and they break their nose

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.040
and there's blood everywhere and she's like it's kind of she describes it kind of like that like

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:59.360
they meant to kind of like just kind of shove hillary a little bit and they ended up pushing

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.960
her and like her falling over and breaking her nose so that's kind of like what the whole like

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.680
email shit ended up being so right yeah yeah yeah i don't know if i described that correctly i'm

It was like they were all staying in a fucking camp.
