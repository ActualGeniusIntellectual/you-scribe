0	9120	hello hello hey how's it going is your mouse working it's now working yeah sorry
10960	19440	so what's going on uh not much um uh was watching obama speak but i kind of got bored honestly um
20720	27280	yeah so usually i'm not gonna buy his his speeches but um yeah i just yeah i don't know even he's not
27280	35280	doing it today hey i guess not um so what's what's new with you okay just give me a minute
35280	42800	i'm gonna post in my discord that i'm chatting with you for a little bit here okay just give
42800	49280	me a minute you're gonna use that at everyone oh boy that's fun actually i have a new twitter
49280	58880	account now too don't tell anyone oh really yeah it's it's called morbius devo oh i'm new do we
58880	65760	know him yes this is uh sfo you recently watched my um three forms of fascism video yeah a few
65760	71680	weeks ago right well i was still sick and you were sick i was sick yeah i was just sick for a really
71680	77520	long time yeah it was a really good video i really like that oh well thank you yeah i think um it's
77520	83440	interesting because whenever i talk to people on the left who are always mad at me about who i
83440	92960	talk to about like um like for example if i'm talking to like far right people they never seem
92960	99440	the people who criticize me on the left or even libs never seem to fully understand what they're
99440	106480	criticizing like they don't know the basics of that sphere and then they think that they have the
107200	111680	knowledge to like debate me on whether i should be talking to them or not if they don't even know
111680	117520	that it's not even called the alt-right anymore like like this is years old information like
117520	123840	and people are are so like just out of touch and they still think like richard spencer's around or
123840	130720	something yeah he's still relevant and stuff no he i mean look he's still doing whatever i don't
130720	134560	know what the fuck he's doing but he's doing something with his friend but nobody listens
134560	144000	to him anymore you know yeah yeah yeah fuck no i think things have changed you know since since
144000	149920	2016 since politics really blew up online things have kind of gone through several waves you know
149920	153760	we had like the alt-right they were doing their thing for a while then bread tube but now bread
153760	162240	tubes kind of gone like no one watches them anymore yeah i don't even yeah i i don't know
162240	165760	what happened to bread tube but somebody called me a breadtuber the other day and i
165760	170000	i don't know it was weird that a few times actually yeah yeah well there's a thing right
170000	175040	now because the right also doesn't understand the left online either so yeah you know sargon
175040	180320	you know sargon and i were good friends we talk every day but he has he has taken to calling
180320	188640	everyone who's not as right wing as him a communist and i'm just like well no i've heard
188640	195760	his logic and i can explain his logic and the logic is basically that the promises of liberalism
195760	201920	always go ultimately unfulfilled by liberalism so liberalism always degenerates into communism
201920	207680	so if you're a liberal it's only a matter of time that sounds like a mixed vivian wolf argument
207680	213840	honestly uh like the opposite of one like oh liberals always turn into fascists because they
213840	220880	always help fascists or something yes yeah and they both kind of think that of of each other i've
220880	227840	noticed that so if you were to actually search like hold on let me just give me give me a second here
228480	237200	all right if you search like the the phrase the promises of liberalism right you will see a lot
237200	245120	you'll find articles and and um and papers and all these things basically about how the liberals
245120	251600	promised under the french revolution they promised um liberty equality and fraternity and the
251600	258160	socialists believe they haven't actually brought any of those values into into politics but
258160	265200	socialism well socialism promises more liberty and more equality and more fraternity does does
265200	273520	socialism on paper i don't even know if on paper it does but okay yeah so on paper it's like in
273520	277840	reality it does not it cannot actually achieve these things but on paper though i mean you hear
277840	282000	this all the time right if you're talking to some breadtuber they'll say listen you like democracy
282000	287040	right stardust well we just want to expand democracy we're expanding it into the workplace
287040	290640	so they're appealing to this idea that the promises of liberalism have failed
291600	298000	and so sargon who has read a lot of the far left stuff he's like oh i guess they're correct so if
298000	303040	you're a liberal you're always going to generate into a communist so sargon is now a conservative
303040	310960	and that's his logic for it it's like well all right wow so so he and like i'm i'm still good
310960	314480	friends with him but he and i we have like arguments all the time i enjoy the arguments
314480	319760	they're fun because we can still be friends even though we disagree right yeah but um you know he's
319760	323680	he's off doing his his lotus eaters thing and it seems you're working out well for him he's got a
323680	327840	couple hundred thousand subs he's built a few new channels like he's doing okay he has like an
327840	333040	office and a staff like a dozen people like he's doing that's based yeah good for him yeah so he's
333040	339920	still he's still doing okay um i expected well i guess i understand his argument but i guess i
339920	349280	just would have expected some more nuance from him but yeah he so he's been doing a lot of reading
350160	355440	hey tidge how's it going he's been tidge is like the resident femboy of my community
355440	359360	what up femboy sorry i should probably call you by your name what up tidge
359360	364720	all right sargon's are doing a lot of reading oh yeah honestly a lot of the same reading that
364720	368720	i did for the fascism video just to understand some of this stuff you know yeah and a lot of
368720	375200	it has led him down a traditionalist rabbit hole interesting and also i think a lot of that is just
375200	378560	the fact that he's uh he's a dad now you know people tend to become more conservative when
378560	382320	they have parent when they have kids yeah just like a normal trend you know i don't blame him
383600	386720	um there was one thing i noticed i was watching your obama video
386720	392480	he talked about the nancy pelosi husband hammer attacker right it was just a few days ago that
392480	399120	a friend of mine paul pelosi was attacked in his own home somebody breaks into his house looking
399120	406000	for his wife nancy the speaker of the house and thankfully he's he's back home now and we're
406000	410880	going to let investigators do their jobs but but here's what's clear pittsburgh
411920	418960	this habit we've had we have of demonizing political opponents of saying crazy stuff
420320	427760	it creates a dangerous climate and and when you have people who are in leadership positions
427760	434080	who promote or ignore over the top rhetoric and then when there's an attack like this they make
434080	438560	light of it they joke about it then more people are going to get hurt
440800	447120	and more than that we violate the basic spirit of our democracy the spirit of who we are as
447120	453200	americans and how like people on on the right are kind of making fun of it or they're saying that
453200	458160	you know it might have been like a guy who was trying to have sex with him and then it went awry
458160	461600	and like there's all these things going on with that story and we don't know what's going on yet
462560	470560	um he seems to be correct i mean i don't expect obama to necessarily be bipartisan he's clearly
470560	476960	a democrat right but like did you hear about the shooting of the republican candidate a couple days
476960	484400	ago no i did not yeah so this is yeah let me just pull it out real quick i i talked about it this
484400	491040	morning on the weekly sip do i still have it um yeah republican congressional candidate candidates
491360	497840	pat herrington's house was shot up and his children were inside holy shit he's running against
497840	502720	democrat jeff jackson and yeah they're okay he's running against democrat jeff jackson in district
502720	506720	14 the fbi is investigating let's see if i can find an article so you don't just have to take my
506720	518320	word for it which state is this again uh let me see let me see let me see uh pat herrington is
518320	528400	the name uh harrigan sorry north carolina okay here here's the ap news article so one thing i've
528400	535760	noticed is that the right wing of the internet is talking about this like 24 7 right now okay
535760	542560	they're talking about how there's some deranged leftoid who's going around shooting up uh
542560	547360	republican candidates who are running for office and how this is ridiculous and the left has gone
547360	552800	too far and this is too much meanwhile at the same time you ignore on the left on the left
552800	558720	side of the internet's talking about this but no one on the right is talking about any violence
558720	563920	that their guys commit you know like we we've reached this point in politics where it seems like
564720	570960	it seems like both sides are just willing to point the finger at their opponents but ignore it when
570960	580320	their side does it you know what i mean yeah okay i could see that um yeah do they know who did the
580320	586400	shooting not yet the fbi is still investigating this is like two days old this is two days old
586400	592640	damn i know you watched another one of my videos where i went over just like a lot of the stuff
592640	597120	that like a lot of people who were just regular republican voters who were getting harassed over
597120	600800	the course like like that i know i know you watched the video and you like exclaimed a lot
600800	606320	of shock at the one guy who got his like eye socket broken um yeah where he like he was like
606320	609920	an asian guy in new york he just like wore a mega hat around and then a bunch of people just kicked
609920	614480	the shit out of them you know and you don't see that reported on so i i think i think we've
614480	619920	reached this point in at least american politics where both sides are existing in a completely
619920	626240	different news bubble and they're only seeing the stuff that makes them look like victims and makes
626240	632320	their political opponents look like basically nazis and that's a pretty dangerous place to be
632320	636480	in because no one people aren't talking the same language anymore yeah that is dangerous that's
636480	643680	very dangerous um it's interesting there's that you say like victim and like then the other side
643680	652240	is the aggressor um and i find that that like repeating in a lot of different um spheres online
652240	657680	and in person where um there's like this paint i don't know what it is but it seems like everybody
657680	665120	right now is kind of like bent on painting themselves as victims of uh of someone or you
665120	671120	know whatever like i don't know it just seems it seems like people are very obsessed with the whole
671120	680160	victimhood thing yeah yeah so there's there's a paper that was written maybe in 2009 it was a
680240	685600	philosophy paper i know sargon showed it to me i know that taftaj has read it but i forget the
685600	689360	name of the guy i can tell you the ideas but i forget the name of the guy who wrote it but he
689360	697360	basically said that all of politics and all of morality does ultimately come down to justifying
697360	704640	victimhood and how every political camp behaves in the exact same way they just have different
704640	710720	targets and his argument was basically that if you look at fascists right the fascists they
710720	718560	always claim to be victims of something you know there there's some group out there that is
718560	722960	oppressing them it can be the jews or it can be the blacks or it can be it could be race mixers
722960	726560	it can be it can be marxists or liberals or whoever but there's a group out there that's
726560	732720	oppressing them and they're doing things to them that violate their nazi code of ethics
733520	737360	and so they are they're victims and they're justified in oppressing them back
737360	741520	and from the nazi point of view they're correct because the nazis happen to have an ethical code
741520	747600	that they follow and the liberals necessarily have to oppress them so they are actually victims
747600	750400	and the socialists say the same thing the socialists always say well we're victims of
750400	756080	the capitalist system and and of the and of a you know like a you know the bourgeois and whoever
756080	762240	right and from their point of view they're also correct so they because they have defined what
762320	766960	aggression is as capitalist action if you know if you own property that's aggression right
766960	771200	things like that and then if you look at the liberals liberals do the same thing because
771200	777920	the liberals will say well we only oppress people who are censors or who who do oppressing first
777920	782960	but that's still ultimately oppressing the liberal political opponents because it's only the
782960	790160	liberals who value non-aggression who or who values self-defense as its own virtue so like
790160	795360	whenever when when people say there was a debate it was destiny versus a muslim guy
795360	801040	like last year or something and the muslim guy basically said well we like the liberals are
801040	804080	oppressing us and the destiny said well how are the liberals oppressing you it's like well they
804080	811280	won't let us right sorry who do you know his name yeah i think it's daniel hikikichu it might be i
811280	815040	don't remember his name but he said that he basically said that the liberals are preventing
815040	819360	us from applying sharia law and it's like well isn't sharia law oppressive and he's like not
819360	825440	to us it isn't because every political camp defines what constitutes aggression and what
825440	832080	constitutes oppression in in basically in their in their own favor and so after they've created
832080	836880	that normativity they can then go after their political opponents for violating the normativity
836880	842560	so liberals and socialists and fascists they all behave in the same way in the end they just have
842560	849440	different targets and it really just boils down to well what targets do you find do you think are
849440	854640	morally acceptable to go after and as soon as you realize that's what politics is everything becomes
854640	860320	very scary you know what i mean yeah because now now it's much harder to actually negotiate
860320	865120	anything and i think that's that's like the road that we've all gone down recently is that no one's
865120	872960	negotiating anymore no one's listening to each other anymore yeah um yeah no it does it seems
872960	879280	like even like 10 years ago um politics used to be like way more bipartisan i'm not really sure
879280	884480	if it's like social media and algorithms that's made people more siloed or what um
886560	891680	but i mean part of that yeah yeah it's part of it but i think there are some sacrifices that we do
891680	898480	need to to make right like if liberalism is oppressive to towards people who want to
899040	904800	practice sharia law unfortunately we are going by like what the majority wants here
904800	912400	the majority does not want sharia law the majority um would not um be okay with sharia law
912960	920640	uh so i mean at a certain point we like yeah it may be oppressive in some sort of way to you but
921280	929120	um i would say it is justified i guess sure but but then all that means is that if you ever lose
929120	933040	the majority then you're you're automatically wrong right so for example if you go to a muslim
933040	939280	majority country and you're relying on on that sentiment to to basically guide your morality
939280	944000	well now suddenly it's moral to to oppress gay people if you live in a muslim majority country
944640	951440	so that also has its own pitfalls that that's why you know i was we were both i know you were
951440	956480	on the call and i was listening to the call yeah of um over on destiny's channel earlier about the
956480	963360	whole like anti-democracy arc or whatever and like there's a decent argument there's actually
963360	969120	a few solid decent arguments to be to just strictly being anti-democracy and i think like
969120	973520	the you know do you want to live in a country where the majority of people want to oppress you
973600	978880	that's a pretty good one right there right like if you're if you're gay living in saudi arabia
980080	983520	it is the democratic will of the people that you be thrown off the building and it's like well
983520	990560	that's no good you know there there's there has to be some some kind of virtue system that is
990560	994480	above democracy i think which is a very strange way to put it because i'm still a liberal but
994480	999360	you know what i mean yeah there's something going on here um okay
1004800	1009040	i mean i i don't know i feel i i guess what i would hope for if i were living in one of
1009040	1015280	those countries is that over time you know culture would change and that through the culture changing
1015280	1023280	um people would enact change in their government and things like that but uh yeah if if everybody
1025200	1032080	if if i guess if a majority of the population occupies a place and it's like an actual democracy
1032080	1038400	and majority that population believes in things that are going to be oppressive very oppressive
1038400	1047840	to specific groups then i guess you yeah you have a point um and to be fair that is the world we
1047840	1051760	live in now yeah you know because because we do oppress non-liberals in liberal countries you know
1051760	1056240	we don't let the socialists you know have their violent revolution here we have to oppress them
1057280	1061120	someone's always getting oppressed yeah that's that's just the nature of politics right yeah
1061120	1066800	i guess so yeah i guess i would just say it's justified but then whether
1068640	1074960	i i would say it's justified that um that they are getting oppressed in some sort of way but
1076720	1079760	if it were the opposite like you're saying um in a different country where
1080640	1085920	the majority wants to throw somebody off a building um i i don't know that i i would
1085920	1090720	necessarily say that it's justified to throw them off the building but i would just say it's
1090720	1097360	justified for them to enact that because the majority voted that way i guess maybe i don't
1097360	1103840	know yeah that's where we get to the part that like democracy can be just as oppressive as any
1103840	1109040	kind of dictatorship in the end where it all depends on on what the power is used for right
1109760	1116080	so sure sure yeah it can be um it can be but i think there's less i think there's more
1116080	1121200	opportunities for it to not be oppressive i guess oh sure like here's the thing i'm still
1121200	1125520	ultimately pro-democracy i just know the anti-democracy argument very well like like
1125520	1131440	for example the um i don't know if you've made it public where you live do you are you in california
1131440	1138640	or la i'm not no okay but you know but you know about the um the urban sprawl problem there right
1139280	1145440	how it's just like hundreds of miles of houses yeah it sucks yeah yeah so that's a problem
1145440	1150560	that's uh that's unique to democracy actually because if you have you know you have a
1150560	1154400	neighborhood where everyone where there's a bunch of small landowners right and well what's what's
1154400	1157600	what would be good for that neighborhood is if you build an apartment block because if you build
1157600	1163120	an apartment block that those are going to be cheaper places to rent that poor people can go
1163120	1169520	live in and then now suddenly demand for all that housing goes way down but and so now people can
1169520	1173040	actually buy houses and own houses the middle class can actually have houses again like they
1173040	1178400	could 50 years ago but the problem with that is that that also means that um the property values
1178400	1187040	go down and every single person who owns property in la is never ever ever going to vote for a
1187040	1192240	zoning reform that will allow giant apartment blocks to be built because it actually hurts
1192240	1197760	their own bottom line so this is an instance where every single voter will always vote in
1197760	1205920	their own interest but that interest destroys society and so so like nimbyism itself is is
1205920	1211600	a problem unique to democracy right um it's the same thing with like prison reform nobody likes
1211600	1217120	how american prisons are but no one ever actually votes to change them and no one ever wants a
1217120	1221120	prison built in their backyard no one ever wants prisoners to be released into their community you
1221120	1227920	know so so nimbyism like if you had a let's say a a benevolent philosopher king he would just build
1227920	1234240	the apartment block and he would just build the prison as the society needed it you know and uh
1234240	1238960	i don't know i feel like nimbyism is one of those things that would be changed even through
1238960	1243440	democracy like i think that there are enough people that that it's plausible that there are
1243440	1248640	enough people eventually who would want um who would be willing to make that sacrifice in their
1248640	1257280	in their home like their property value going down uh just to fix the um the problem of people
1257280	1262880	not having enough places to live uh like is that maybe we haven't seen it yet though you know
1264240	1268000	i mean there's a little bit of a movement right like there's a little bit of a movement kind of
1268000	1274080	starting up around it maybe maybe it might happen but i don't know like it's that's a tough one i
1274080	1283680	mean another like if here do you do you want the ultimate black pill sure okay so when when trump
1283680	1291600	was refusing to concede the election right yeah who was it who was it on the right that was
1291600	1305360	actually standing up to trump uh pence um um pence did a little bit yeah and and to his credit
1305360	1314080	to his credit but every single republican politician who who basically had their jobs
1314080	1319840	on the line because they were being voted in and they knew how um how popular trump was they
1319840	1325600	didn't say a single thing it was it was republican judges that looked into the cases and said no
1325600	1332160	these have no merit it was um the attorney general whose position was appointed not elected you know
1332160	1338000	it was the head of the fbi these are all positions that they don't need to worry about um public
1338000	1343520	popularity and they were the ones that had the political space to oppose trump from the right
1344320	1351600	and ultimately it was those guys who did their part in saving democracy the all the ones who
1351600	1355920	who were in like unsafe seats and who had to get re-elected they didn't say a single thing
1355920	1361920	you know yeah the ultimate black pill is that it was the anti-democratic elements of
1362640	1365920	the american republic that saved democracy interesting
1365920	1375600	and so i i think that's why like america has both democratic and autocratic elements because because
1375600	1380000	you need both of them in some sense you need you need a component of your government that
1380000	1383360	is outside the democratic process in order to be able to accurately judge it
1385600	1392160	okay that makes sense couch man in the in the chat's been converted he now loves authoritarianism
1392240	1393200	based nice
1395920	1399680	yeah i guess that i guess i guess that's true yeah it was it was the
1400720	1404640	okay that's that's interesting i feel like my brain isn't big enough for this but i think
1404640	1411920	i'm getting what you're saying here i'll give you one final one final black pill hold on let me find
1411920	1418560	this let me just pull this up real quick isn't something else taftage has sent me she's got a big
1418560	1422800	brain she knows what's going on oh yeah she does yeah you've spoken to her before
1425040	1431920	uh yeah yeah i have i like her a lot yeah it's funny like as soon as she went on destiny that
1431920	1437040	first time i messaged her and i was like oh yeah you know you seem really cool and and then she
1437040	1441040	like immediately follows me back on twitter and then fangirls out because apparently she's been
1441040	1448800	watching me for years and i was like oh okay that's so base okay i'll i'll pull i'll give you
1448800	1454800	this study here from cambridge testing theories of american politics elites interest groups and
1454800	1463520	average citizens um so the tldr of this study is let me just let me just find that tldr the tldr
1463520	1470960	the study is basically it's basically that the statistical correlation between
1472240	1478400	how much money you make and whether or not the policies that you vote for actually get implemented
1478960	1484880	goes up the more money you make and so when you have when you're in the lowest income bracket in
1484880	1492240	the united states who you vote for basically doesn't matter and as your income goes up
1493120	1498960	the more likely it is that the policies you want and that you vote for end up coming true
1500400	1505040	which is a very interesting way to look at democracy is that you know if you if you are
1505040	1510160	a very poor person and you vote for a candidate because he says he's going to do xyz the chances
1510160	1518400	of him doing xyz is actually very low yeah okay there are ways to change that though right like
1518400	1527520	from a local advocacy point right like a i don't know like you're right this study is right sure
1527520	1534560	um i guess um i don't know what i'm getting at here i have no idea what i'm saying
1535360	1543760	take the authoritarian pill stardust i don't think i i don't think i can just yeah but um i don't
1543760	1548720	know god become god emperor trump and or biden whoever you want it's got to be a god emperor
1548720	1554320	though i don't mind being god emperor you know but i just feel like i i still strongly believe
1554320	1561040	in and advocating for people to get out and vote because because yeah the the i mean the less you
1561040	1566720	vote the less it really does matter i guess like it i don't know i feel like it takes it takes two
1566720	1574640	to tango right like we you can't expect um you can't expect your your hopes to be fulfilled when
1574640	1582080	you can't even elect the people that want to um to help you achieve that goal yeah see so like
1582080	1587040	at the end of it i'm still pro-democracy right i'm just i'm not i am i am kind of larping here i
1587040	1591040	understand the other point of view but i am pro-democracy democracy you know it's just that i
1591040	1595840	understand that democracy it can't be the the ultimate value it can't be the highest political
1595840	1600880	value it has to be only a part of your political process sure what do you think the other values
1600880	1606480	are oh well in the united states it's the constitution right the constitution the whole
1606480	1613120	point of the constitution is that these are things that even if the population votes for them the
1613120	1620320	government cannot do and so if you have that limit on democracy then you can at least rein in the
1620320	1625840	excesses of the tyranny of the majority that's the that's the reason that your republic is set
1625840	1631680	up the way that it is okay and you know there's there's it's more on the left than on the right
1631680	1636480	because on the right you at least have the libertarians on the left they just do not give
1636480	1642160	a shit about the constitution they're like any institution that stands in the way of us
1642160	1647520	implementing our politics is an illegitimate institution and must be dismantled and overthrown
1647520	1652000	and subverted because our politics are just that moral and righteous that's a lot of what the left
1652000	1659040	says right now and that's insane like no there needs to be some limit on everyone's politics
1660080	1667600	including yours you know i would agree with that yeah yeah so i i finally i and and you know the
1667600	1671520	right does it too because the right has now gone on like this anti-democracy arc of their own
1671520	1676720	because they lost an election right like um i think i mentioned in the fascism video i mentioned
1676720	1684320	something along the lines of um fascists tend to as soon as an institution produces a result that
1684320	1690320	they don't like they tend to completely delegitimize the institution they attack the rules of the game
1690320	1694400	rather than accepting the fact that they lost the game you know yeah and you see fascists on the
1694400	1698960	left do this and fascists on the right do this because fascism is neither left nor right yeah
1698960	1705040	in the oh i hate it when also when i i hear like um leftists who try to say that like oh fascism
1705040	1715040	is inherently right-wing and it's like well not um not really no no yeah um but yeah like the
1716400	1720720	it's just the acceptance like i know americans they really harp on about democracy a lot how
1720720	1725920	good it is and how moral it is and you know we're the country is like all this stuff but like there
1725920	1735520	there's other parts of politics that also need their due respect i think you know i'm not an
1735520	1739440	anarcho-capitalist i don't like the anarcho-capitalists i have read some of their
1739440	1744480	stuff and the one political innovation that's actually good that comes from the anarcho-capitalists
1745040	1752960	is when um hop i think i think he did it in democracy the god that failed hop said something
1752960	1761840	like rights are inherently anti-democratic yeah you know what you're saying exactly that makes
1761840	1768400	sense i get i get that makes sense yeah yeah you don't vote on rights yeah yeah the idea is that
1768400	1773280	like you know if you own a house you have a right to it and if a hundred people walk into your house
1773280	1778240	and vote themselves the owners of your house well no you own it your your right overrides their
1778240	1783760	democracy and you have the right to remove them with force you know so if you have a right to a
1783760	1790720	thing then the public's vote doesn't matter you know you know if you're if you have a right to
1790720	1794400	be gay it doesn't matter if the majority doesn't want you to be gay you can do what you want in
1794400	1798960	your private life you know so i think that's like the limit on that's a reasonable limit on
1798960	1808880	democracy is the idea of rights um yeah it's we we just seem to be in like a dark time right now
1808880	1817360	politically dark time what do you think the solution is um fuck the more that i look into
1817360	1823600	it the more the solution is probably just going to be a fight you know like like if you look at
1823600	1830800	like a fist fight or what no possibly a civil war in the united states i'm not gonna go i'm
1830800	1835840	not going full tim pool on you here i think it's a far i think like it's it might happen in the next
1835840	1842800	hundred years it might be a long time but like anytime you see tensions like this where you have
1842800	1847520	two groups that just live in different realities they tend over the course of history they've
1847520	1853520	always tended to just form their own nations you know like an east united states and a west united
1853520	1858320	states there would be like the coasts and the interior or something like that you know they
1858320	1866000	tend to like they tend to split up you know damn happens in the balkans east and west roman empire
1866000	1871200	like pick a country and it happens the only place it doesn't really happen is china china has always
1871200	1876880	had like massive wars of reunification they tend to stay together but like european history is
1876880	1882480	always about the history of of ethnicities and peoples and nations breaking up because they just
1882480	1886880	start living in different realities i wonder what that would look like i wonder if it was like the
1886880	1896480	postal united states and then there would be like the i don't know in in inside or whatever i don't
1896480	1903760	know what that would look like yeah i know um do you watch what if i'll test uh i don't what is that
1904800	1911360	uh what if i'll test he is primarily a history youtuber but he's also got a big brain here
1912480	1922800	let me find so he did he did a two-part video series where is it
1925520	1931840	a two-part video series two months ago and it's called explaining america's nine nations it's
1931840	1936240	a good it's a good it's like a two-hour watch it's a great watch oh shit he just goes really
1936320	1942560	he goes yeah he goes into detail of basically these nine ethnicities that exist on the american
1942560	1948240	continent and you've got like the caribbeans and you've got the midwesterners and you've got the
1948240	1953680	people living on like the west coast you've got the the kobeckers the kobeckers you know
1953680	1959440	the um the acadians that live in like the the northeast um northeast america and canada like
1959440	1965280	and it's just these are the ethnic okay i'm using ethnic in a in a european sense um yeah
1966640	1972560	like cultural traditions and habits the the differences between these nine these
1972560	1979680	nine geographic locations in north america yeah and they i mean it might here's the thing like
1980320	1984880	i don't want any sort of civil war i hope america like america has had some moments
1984880	1988080	where it's been pre-divided and usually they can bring it back to the center and like
1988080	1992400	hold on right i hope that happens again but it might not you know who who knows what the
1992400	2002480	future is going to bring who knows yeah wow but he he's a great channel he does so much
2002480	2008800	good stuff and he's um he is like a center right-leaning kind of guy and and sometimes
2008800	2016400	that comes through but he tends to focus mainly on just history and so he's i highly recommend
2016560	2024080	stuff yeah i'll take a look at his stuff it's super cool i know he uh he he debated vosh
2024080	2030880	like maybe six months ago or so and like he would have absolutely dumpstered vosh but
2030880	2038240	but he has no charisma and vosh is all charisma yeah so like clearly what if alt-hist had the
2038240	2044960	knowledge to just run circles around vosh but he didn't know how to say it and vosh just basically
2044960	2049600	went like squeaked through on the fumes it was a really funny debate to watch though
2049600	2056080	i i think it's interesting um i've noticed in these debates now that you can prepare a lot you
2056080	2062240	can know everything about a subject but if you know how to kind of work the conversation i feel
2062240	2067520	like you can know next to nothing about a subject and still make the other person look like an
2067520	2073840	idiot basically oh yeah fucking terrible and it's and it's and i feel like i've used it to
2073840	2081840	my advantage a couple of times and i feel a little bit bad about it so yeah um i know like
2081840	2086320	like back in 2017 the alt-right was learning that the whole the hard way because you had like the
2086320	2091600	you had like um you know the warski show warski live or whatever it was you had tonka's show and
2091600	2096480	stuff and they all just got by in charisma and it worked for a while but eventually you know reality
2096480	2102640	snaps back and they all got they all fell apart because i know um destiny debated them a bunch
2102640	2106560	sargon debated them a bunch and they all just kind of crumbled you know because eventually
2106560	2111920	that that stops working eventually people kind of figure it out eventually yeah yeah there's a guy
2111920	2117600	in the in your chat i think his name is elective tool he said that this guy this guy is sus i bet
2117600	2125360	i know his his idea on ukraine what do you think my idea on ukraine is dude yeah what is your idea
2125440	2132080	on ukraine i mean i'm i'm pro ukraine obviously yeah yeah i mean some people think that i'm like
2133120	2138080	oh god i mean it's because of the friends that i have right but like i'm not like a pro russia
2138080	2141520	simp that some of the people on the right seem to be like they that's that's fucking insane
2141520	2148320	that shit is weird to me like uh talk about they're siding with like like russia and and
2148960	2152480	i don't know they're buying up like russia and china talking points and it's like
2153120	2160160	bro you don't like china is the communist or they were the communists like you know this like what
2160160	2164960	are you doing why are you why are you backing the guy who wants to bring the ussr back again i mean
2164960	2169680	i don't know if he actually does but like you know like that's kind of what they're known for there
2169680	2176080	you you guys are literally backing them like you know what's going on there's a few reasons for
2176160	2181440	that um do you watch kraut's videos you know kraut is uh yeah i love kraut i used to watch
2181440	2190720	um his a lot of his videos actually um he just did a video on um on the political ideology of
2190720	2197760	putin's russia another hour-long video but it's amazing it's great um actually he used he i know
2197760	2202720	that he watched and critiqued my uh my fascism video and he actually got my reading list and
2202720	2206720	he used some of his some of my books for his video so that's that was actually pretty cool
2206720	2216560	to see um yeah but he um he goes basically into it's two russian fascists and then one
2216560	2222080	german and their political basically their political science writing and how these three
2222080	2226960	guys basically have influenced putin's putin's outlook on life and on politics
2227840	2236720	um and and basically when you see people when you see like western rightists they're simping
2236720	2242080	for russia and simping for putin their their view is some of it's going to be religious
2242720	2251840	because they they see the west as this decadent globohomo lgbtq rainbow capitalist nightmare
2252800	2259680	and it's and the only place that is um pushing forward traditional values
2260320	2265760	and and christian values is russia and the russian orthodox church and so this is the
2265760	2270800	only christianity we can get in politics we'll take it so some of them are siding with russia
2270800	2276480	for religious reasons um some of them are siding with russia because so so in this case this is
2276480	2281200	like the paul joseph watson's if you go over to his channel he has a video he made in the past
2281200	2288560	few months called like the end of the liberal world order or something like that and and what
2288560	2292960	these guys believe when they say liberal world order what they're talking about is like uh free
2292960	2299600	trade and you know just just the idea that the neo lib idea that like if you liberalize markets it
2299600	2304560	liberalizes politics which to be fair has actually failed at this point um the germans were buying
2304560	2309360	oil from the russians hoping that that the russians liberalizing their market would also
2309360	2314160	liberalize russian politics and it did not you know americans have been buying cheap shit from
2314160	2320880	china for 25 years because clinton and bush both believed that if china opened up its markets it
2320880	2326960	would liberalize their politics and it didn't so the neo libs were wrong on that um but there's
2327760	2333680	the they'll also call it like the rules based world order and basically these are guys that
2333680	2341200	want to see that collapsed and pulled apart as part of dismantling liberal hegemony because
2341200	2346480	they want to return to a more conservative way of viewing the world and and of doing politics
2346480	2352160	are more like insular we don't interfere in each of those countries anymore so we're dismantling
2352160	2357840	nato we're dismantling all these global alliances and everyone just stays in their lane i did call
2357840	2364400	bush a neo lib because bush was actually a neo lib the neo cons are neo libs yeah interesting
2364400	2370160	okay these economically i mean economically they are um so so you have guys like paul just
2370160	2377280	watson who are like listen if we want to challenge the the western liberal stranglehold on politics
2377280	2383840	and the western and the dominant western liberal block we need somebody who's willing to show that
2383920	2388480	all of the rules are just they're just a sham they're they're a paper tiger
2388480	2394560	so they want russia to win and in fact these people have basically been completely btfo'd
2394560	2399120	by the fact that ukraine has been winning the war they these are people who thought that the
2399120	2404720	war would be over in two weeks um so you have like the political reason you have the religious reason
2404720	2411360	and then you just have the fact that the russians are are basically like a new a new variant of
2411360	2417360	neo-fascist and then you have a bunch of post fascists in in the in the west and they're
2417360	2422400	basically just siding with them for that reason and so those are the three main reasons why you
2422400	2426560	see a lot of people on the right supporting russia and then there's like a fourth one and
2426560	2431600	the fourth one is like conspiracy laden where they just they just don't trust the west's
2431600	2437120	interpretation and you know to be fair the west has done some weird shit with propaganda as well
2437120	2442240	like we're not innocent of this so i i get it right you know you always have the cia overthrowing
2442240	2447520	governments in like the third world and you know people lying about this or that like you've seen
2447520	2453760	that in our history so they're basically saying hey what if all of the liberal history we've been
2453760	2460000	taught is just propaganda and so now they're like this is this is like for example what like aden
2460000	2466240	paladin thinks um on the right where like it where the entire narrative about ukraine cannot
2466240	2471360	be trusted because we've all seen it filtered through an american lens and the americans aren't
2471360	2481040	impartial yeah aden paladin is a um is i just talked to her recently i was really surprised
2481040	2487920	to hear that she's a monarchist um yes she's a libertarian monarchist actually yeah yeah that
2487920	2495680	was really which is a ridiculous idea idea yeah libertarian almost kind of like it
2497120	2501760	monarchist like man i i don't i'm i'm still wrapping my head around that one
2502640	2507520	yeah yeah she's really into patriarchal stuff she really likes the patriarchal
2507520	2513280	you know uh aspect of of like a religious kind of like monarchy or something like that
2514240	2518000	i mean i i hate to say it but i think part of that might just be sexual with her
2518000	2524320	um but i know part of it for sure yeah yeah you know i don't want to go too hard because
2524320	2530800	aden and i have had like it recently had a big fight oh okay yeah she basically whatever you
2530800	2537600	want to say well the tldr is that she she leaked my dms and i don't take that kindly so i i've
2537600	2542400	stopped associated she there's nothing like bad in them because i don't say bad things but i still
2542400	2545840	think it's like a breach of privacy so i was like you know what maybe you and i shouldn't
2545840	2551200	talk anymore you know um yeah but in terms of ideology the whole libertarian monarchist thing
2551200	2559040	is basically that she believes that government is a corporation and so to best run government
2559040	2562720	you should structure it like it's a corporation like it's privately owned so you have a monarch
2562720	2570000	who is like a president or a ceo someone who owns the company and then the landed aristocracy they're
2570000	2576160	like your middle managers and then your serfs are your employees and so the reason that she believes
2576160	2583040	that this makes sense is because someone who owns the company is not incentivized to destroy their
2583040	2587840	own company because they own it they generate wealth from it they care about it it's their
2587840	2593760	creation meanwhile an elected president can go into an office fuck it up for four years
2594400	2600640	you know his his his his um the next guy in line will will pardon him for any of his crimes then
2600640	2605680	he goes on to live a private life he gets a book deal you know he gets he gets he gets to go on tv
2605680	2609600	talk about how how he did these great things for four years as he fucked your country up
2610400	2618160	and so the the american presidential system means that individual bad actors have no accountability
2618160	2625360	if they come into power but in the libertarian monarchist system you are at least incentivized
2625360	2630400	to maintain the social structure because you are enriching yourself through it
2631440	2639040	now this is a retarded idea but i can see her point of view yeah i can at least see her point
2639040	2648000	of view oh hey pangas what's up man i guess i think you want pangas watches me and destiny
2648000	2657840	i think both of us oh cool so yeah yeah um i don't know how okay yeah i guess
2659040	2664880	dude i'm i'm just sorry about ranting so much no it's cool it's cool um i guess i don't know
2664880	2670720	how you can have a real like a libertarian monarchy with like a religious monarchy though
2670720	2675680	i just don't i just don't get it don't um i have to think about it some more
2680000	2685280	to be fair to her um she's come to religion recently and mainly out of her knowledge of
2685280	2689680	psychology because she's very well educated on psychology she has i think a master's degree in
2689680	2697200	psych yeah um she knows her stuff for sure so i i think a lot of a lot of her religious her
2697200	2703840	a lot of her recent religious experiences has been grounded in in psych to be fair that's how
2703840	2707280	a lot of people nowadays are get are getting to religions generally through psychology you know
2707280	2710880	they're they're reaching some limits of their own mind and and of their own they're like they're
2710880	2714480	starting to think about like oh well why are we this way and you know why do we think like this
2714800	2721040	why do we have these effects you know yeah um i think a lot of them come to religion because
2721040	2725200	they're you know psychology kind of leads them there i i don't fully understand that
2725200	2730000	myself because i'm an atheist yeah i i i need to look into this at some point i've been reading
2730000	2737840	some some psychology i i i took like intro to psych and then abnormal psych like 10 to 15 years
2737840	2744000	ago it's been a long time since i've been in school yeah um that's hens hops taking a nutshell
2744000	2752800	yeah yeah it is um hans herman hop he's the anacap guy okay okay um yeah i i don't know um much about
2752800	2759440	psychology um i guess one thing that i found interesting in in the psych world or whatever
2759440	2765520	or like the pseudo psych world is all all of these like youtube body language uh analyzers
2765520	2769440	have you found that weird because i find that shit really weird i actually don't know what
2769440	2774080	you're talking about oh yeah there are all these like youtubers who are like body language
2774080	2782240	analyzers and they try to tell you everything about somebody um based on like based based on
2782240	2786640	like uh the body language that they display during an interview or something like that
2786640	2790320	and they'll like over analyze it and it's super cringe in my opinion
2790320	2797520	i mean there's probably something to it you can definitely see like oh if you know if you sit
2797520	2801760	this way or you use your hands in this way like there's probably something there but i can see how
2801760	2806240	like all that stuff can also be faked if you're smart enough right so who actually knows you know
2809280	2816560	the issue is that i think when it comes to deception versus intuition the the perfect
2816560	2821280	i don't know deceptionist will always beat the perfect intuitionist in a lot of sense in a lot
2821280	2826880	of senses because you can always fake a thing and you can always fake it just as well as it can be
2826880	2834720	real when it comes to body language or how you speak how you lie you know so i think i i there's
2834720	2838960	probably something there but it's probably not like it's probably not anything that's universal
2838960	2843280	you know i'm sure a lot of it is just youtube nonsense because there's so much youtube nonsense
2843280	2854880	out there yeah actually that reminds me um when you were reacting to the um my fascism video
2856000	2863600	you i got to the part where i talked about the guy who said that that socialists should have sex with
2863600	2868400	children as a form of anti-fascism and you you kind of lost your mind a bit do you remember that
2869280	2873760	i don't remember what i said there but no what like what do you what happened i recall
2874560	2880240	or what do you recall i guess so the um well just that you you thought it was insane and you were
2880240	2886400	just like you're incredulous but but basically the idea was um you've got wilhelm reich who
2886400	2890960	wrote the mass psychology of fascism he was a socialist also a german psych psychoanalyst
2891520	2898240	and his view was that um sexual repression is what causes people to vote
2898240	2903040	fascist if they grow up in a sexually repressive society if they themselves are sexually repressed
2903040	2908640	then they're going if their politics will lean fascist these are one of the people that you that
2908640	2914320	that weren't fascists that wrote about fascism right yes yes okay all right makes a lot of sense
2914320	2921040	yeah and so his his view was because he like wrote in like the the prime age of freud's he
2921040	2926560	was very freudian right oh really okay yeah so it was all about sex it was all it's always about
2926560	2934000	sex with freud so he was he was basically talking about um how if we you know part of the socialist
2934000	2939680	project has to be a loosening of traditional sexual morality to be more inclusive and that
2939680	2945120	will combat fascism but then and i mean maybe there's something to that maybe there's not who
2945120	2951200	knows right but then continuing from his work was the italian communist mario mielli and he
2952000	2960080	continued on by saying oh yeah so he that guy was so correct that um we should actually have sex
2960080	2968560	with children because if we have sex with children it will create in them a form of sexuality that is
2968560	2977200	so open that they can never become fascists and he basically said that if you are a gay man
2977760	2982080	you must also be a pedophile for the good of the socialist project
2984240	2987120	i don't know i feel like this dude was just trying to take advantage of like
2987920	2994400	of what he can get do some such shit that's what i think honestly yes yeah obviously right yeah
2994400	3002240	like he he wrote this whole like 90 page manifesto on like the communist politics of italy and and
3002240	3007280	how like and how and how in order to prevent fascism from ever coming to power again in italy
3007280	3011040	you had to do certain things sexually with children like it was a whole big fucking thing
3012800	3021280	it's it's it was extremely ridiculous some of the things that he wrote about but holy fuck um
3021280	3028000	the one thing that i didn't mention in the video one thing because it was too spicy it was too
3028000	3037760	spicy yeah is that uh i know vosh swears by wilhelm reich in the mass psychology of fascism
3038480	3043040	and i don't know if he knows if if mario mielli like spun off from his work
3043680	3050240	yeah but you know that's that's just another point on the vosh sus list somebody's getting
3050240	3055040	longer and longer somebody should tell him maybe you should like be like yo do you know about this
3055040	3061920	like i don't know if you want to be associated with this guy like well to be fair vosh vosh
3061920	3066400	thinks i'm a fascist and he won't talk to me so oh really oh okay i don't know what vosh thinks
3066400	3072800	about me anymore i know that he liked talking to me at some point um and he would like possibly
3072800	3078800	pop into my streams uh pretty often and he would like talk to me every now and then but um i don't
3078800	3085840	know i think yeah i think because i'm like friendly with like pretty much everybody um
3086400	3092080	i don't know i think he's a little bit sus of me though yeah yeah i think i think the the the
3092080	3100640	destiny fault line went right through all you lefty tubers and you and rose wrist and econoboi
3100640	3106000	and all all these people have ended up on the destiny side of the uh of the earthquake you know
3106560	3112240	yeah damn i mean to be fair econobo is also really smart i've spoken to him too and he's
3112240	3118320	actually a pretty smart guy econobo is so smart yeah he is so smart he and i went back and forth
3118320	3124640	on about um about student loan debt forgiveness in the states and i said that it might be a
3124640	3128880	good idea but it's probably the wrong time to do it because it seems like it's a massive wealth
3128880	3133600	transfer from the um the lower class to the middle class so maybe not a good idea right
3133600	3137440	now because things are already pretty heated up in the american economy what did you think of that
3137440	3144480	of that policy i think um i think the way that that they are doing it seems pretty effective
3144480	3149200	like they're targeting specifically people who had pell grants right um those are going to be
3149200	3156960	people who probably need uh that relief the most so yes it is like a massive um transfer of wealth
3156960	3165600	i guess um but but it is it's alleviating things for like the people who need it the most and i
3165600	3175200	think i'm kind of okay with that but um yeah so so my argument against it was that you know if
3175200	3180240	the the libertarians seem to correctly say that if you print money you get inflation like those
3180240	3184240	are there's a correlation there you know yeah now there are some ways in which you can print money
3184240	3189600	that won't cause inflation um but that's like responsible money printing and sometimes the fed
3189600	3193040	is not so responsible it all always depends on what's going there's a bunch of different factors
3193040	3200720	here right so because you know for example if you wanted to start a business and if if money
3200720	3205120	and production are kind of like these two variables that you want to keep in line
3205920	3209360	if you print a bunch of money but don't increase production you've just caused inflation
3209360	3214880	but if you print money and then give that money out in terms of grants to people who can now start
3214880	3218640	businesses that wouldn't be able to start them well now they're more productive so production
3218640	3222400	actually goes up so there's ways to print money that actually also increases production so you
3222400	3226960	don't actually get inflation out of printing money it's possible um just you have to be really
3226960	3234800	responsible about it but if you print money to forgive debt what ends up happening is that you
3234800	3238080	have a bunch of middle class people who hold the debt because they're they're the students who have
3238080	3241680	gone to college and a college degree means you're going to make more money than people who don't go
3241680	3246560	to college generally speaking so you have this this middle class group of students who get their
3246560	3252720	debt forgiven and you're printing money to do it so the rich don't care because one the rich hold
3252720	3256880	not wealth but assets so they don't have like liquid money that's being devalued in their
3256880	3261040	bank accounts they have buildings and property and whatever um but even if they do they don't
3261040	3267360	care they're rich like who cares if food prices go up right but for the poor the absolute poorest of
3267360	3271920	the poor they might only have like 10 20 100 bucks in their account or something the guys
3271920	3277520	live in paycheck to paycheck well now everything's more expensive for them um and so if you're
3277520	3283840	printing money to give to the middle class that seems to be siphoning meaningful wealth directly
3283840	3290880	out of the lower class to do it um and in my opinion it just seems to not have been the right
3290880	3297040	time to do that policy considering all the other stimulus biden had done you know because there's
3297280	3301920	so much stimulus you can do at one point at one point in time before it starts causing inflation
3301920	3305920	you know maybe i should have waited a bit i mean i'm sure he did it just to try to win the midterms
3305920	3309520	right so i mean there's a political reason too well kind of boy did make a good point though
3309520	3315760	that like for for what we're experiencing he like did a breakdown of like the percentages right of
3315760	3320960	like how much something is contributing to inflation and like um how much stimulus was
3320960	3325840	was contributing to inflation all of this right and he and he basically made a breakdown he
3325840	3330320	basically made the argument that whatever inflation we are incurring from these um
3330880	3339680	from from these um policies or these these things that biden is uh like passing um it's worth it
3339680	3345440	because what we're getting in return is so much more is essentially what he's been saying um
3345440	3348720	i don't know if he's done that for the student loan thing i think he did it for the uh
3348720	3355840	uh the the covid stimulus probably yeah the code stimulus yeah yeah yeah i i and here's the thing
3355840	3360480	i i did a similar video um i just called it bidenflation with a bunch of meme symbols in
3360480	3364960	it because it was kind of fun i know my audience got mad at me for it but i did a similar analysis
3364960	3369600	we probably used the same um the same report that came out because there was a report that came out
3369600	3373840	like at the start of the year about how much money biden had spent on stimulus so we probably covered
3373840	3381360	the same thing but the idea was basically like um if inflation is eight percent we can attribute
3381360	3387760	maybe two percent of that to the war in ukraine we can attribute one to two percent of that at
3387760	3392240	uh background inflation which is normal and then we can attribute four percent of that to um
3393120	3398880	to biden stimulus and so if you have four percent as actually the result of biden printing money to
3398880	3405600	give out to people to try and keep the economy afloat during covid um well then what did you
3405600	3410960	get for that four percent inflation and you could say like well we save so many jobs and we you know
3410960	3415920	so many people had certain debts relieved and so many people were able to like you know um
3415920	3420400	keep their keep their heads above water when they had no money and so maybe you can say that four
3420400	3423920	percent inflation is worth that and there's an argument to be made on the numbers there
3423920	3430080	you know how much did you get and is four percent inflation worth it um but i think the right wing
3430880	3437200	accurately points out that a lot of that inflation happened because of the lockdowns anyway
3437200	3442720	and now the right doesn't care about the negative effects of covid right they some of them don't
3442720	3446880	believe that they're it's real some of them say it's not that bad some of them say you know what
3446880	3451120	our personal liberties are more important and you shouldn't have locked us down that's probably the
3451120	3455200	most reasonable argument on the right is that you know this wasn't worth what we paid for it
3455200	3459440	you shouldn't have locked us down okay fair enough we can accept that um just for argument's sake we
3459440	3465440	can accept it so yeah they're going to say hey listen biden you don't get credit for keeping
3465440	3470480	people afloat when it was government action that put their heads below water anyway and i think
3470480	3476240	that's a fair criticism okay yeah yeah if that's the case i can definitely see their their argument
3476240	3484800	there um yeah i don't know um the the thing though is that they're wrong but yeah um like
3484800	3493920	that's you know yeah maybe maybe like explain you know if you lock down and then that destroys
3493920	3498160	businesses and destroys jobs and destroys industries well then you have to ask well
3498160	3502320	was the lockdown worth it was the amount of locking down that you did worth the economic
3502320	3508640	damage that you incurred and if the answer is no well then you can't really give biden the credit
3508640	3514080	for saying well i offset it by printing a bunch of money and giving it to you it's like well
3514880	3520880	that was kind of a band-aid though like i don't know if america would have been better off if you
3520880	3528000	had more infections more deaths but more freedom that's a hard question to answer you know maybe
3528000	3532560	maybe i don't know that it would be because i think our already our medical facilities were
3532560	3539760	like um pretty swamped i had friends who worked in the medical industry um just with the way that
3539760	3545680	it was with with the lockdowns that we had um medical professionals have been like retiring
3545680	3552320	left and right um and i had friends who were nurses who were experiencing so much more death
3552320	3560400	than they were used to um so i think that that was a huge strain on that industry and i think
3560400	3564640	that industry is going to be recovering for a really long time and if it had been any worse
3564640	3572640	i'm not really sure what uh would have happened i guess to that industry you know that's fair but
3572640	3577520	at the same time you know i live in canada where we had a much more strict lockdown than you guys
3577520	3582480	did in the states and we experienced all that stuff too we have nurse burnout we have we have
3582480	3589360	deaths we have businesses that have been destroyed you know um we had a trucker protest which is you
3589360	3593600	know that you know rebelling against the government might be a normal occurrence in the united states
3593600	3601360	that never happens here like that was a once in in a generation event here in canada um so like
3601840	3608160	it see it may be the case that locking down prevented some catastrophe but i feel like
3608880	3613760	like you really have to lock down to prevent all the catastrophe like china has gone full
3613760	3619360	authoritarian mode destroying everything in their path and it hasn't helped that much you know what
3619360	3626320	i mean so i think there's there's like there's diminishing returns on lockdowns and it may be the
3626320	3633040	case that some people on the left went too far or advocated going too far despite the cost that
3633040	3636480	they would have paid otherwise you know what i mean like it seems like there was no good answer here
3639280	3644480	yeah it's really hard to say like you're right it's um it's it's really hard to say
3645520	3648720	how things would have been different when we didn't do those things i guess
3651680	3655040	so in the chat says we should have done the florida protocol for the entire uia
3655040	3659840	us where old people were kept inside and young people were able to be out and about
3659840	3663280	i mean maybe because young people weren't like affected that much by covid in the end it was all
3663280	3669440	old people you know so maybe maybe and then here's the other here's the other side of the
3669440	3673440	conversation we never fully locked down like we were supposed to if we had done it right it would
3673440	3676960	have been worth it without question are you sure about that though because early in the pandemic
3676960	3682560	you saw like chinese people being welded into their apartment blocks and you had like soldiers
3682560	3688080	on the street blasting like cleaners everywhere on the roads and and like people getting arrested
3688080	3694000	for going outside like you want like a full fully locked down where no one moves no one goes to
3694000	3700240	work like everything shuts down i don't think that would have been worth it like you have yeah well
3700240	3707120	them giga like if you want to see what a full a true lockdown is you can look at china and
3707120	3712160	like that was insane like that was nuts yeah that is and i think they're still they're still doing
3713280	3718240	they're still doing their like zero covid policy i believe like or at least i saw like a couple
3718240	3722640	of months ago like people were getting like transported to different facilities that they
3722640	3731440	tested positive for uh for covid and that shit's fucking crazy yep yeah so like it seems like there
3731440	3737120	was just no good answer here it was like either lots of people die and you have your freedom or
3737120	3740880	like you have varying restrictions that get more and more draconian
3742320	3747680	yeah you can walk down people without going so far as to people in their homes no you can't
3747680	3752480	because people are going to go outside they want to you know uh china's still welding people into
3752480	3757520	their apartments apparently i i was not aware of that but they apparently like they have some weird
3758480	3762080	i don't know i don't know if this is true or not because this could just be chinese like propaganda
3762080	3766800	or whatever but they were talking about they have this uh this this cool like grocery app and you
3766800	3771200	can get gross groceries delivered to you or whatever and i don't know how how real that is
3771200	3777600	you know so yeah well i mean we have like instacart over here and stuff so yeah maybe right maybe
3778960	3785440	no i've seen a lot of um did you see oh fuck so i do a podcast with lilith lovett if you know who
3785440	3792480	that is i don't know uh sorry she's this whole space she's um she's she's a trans porn actress
3793200	3800160	okay but she's but she's chinese she's from taiwan um and so we we did a video um on china maybe two

3985760	3990960	okay just find it here i autistically save like everything for videos and streams
3993680	3998560	i was going to my china file for a minute the zenshine nine says china was so extreme
3998560	4003680	there should be a middle ground somewhere at least we should not have had politicians lying to us
4003680	4009040	saying it was all a planned world unleashed pandemic or that dems made it happen on purpose
4009040	4015360	that would have been nice yeah that would have been nice uh i mean i i understand like the
4016720	4025280	the anger about some of the um uh what's what i'm trying to say here there's anger about
4027040	4034480	how people seem to be very hypocritical about who gets to say what you know like if you said that
4035280	4043280	if you said that this was a lab leak you know in 2020 or 2021 you'd be banned off social media you
4043280	4050240	were called like a nazi conspiracy theorist alex jones watcher and until john stewart said it on
4050240	4054720	his show and then it's like oh why is he allowed to say it now you know and now you have people in
4054720	4058560	congress saying i was like well come on guys like there was so much double standards on what you
4058560	4062160	were allowed to say whether or not it was correct like maybe it would have been all just conspiracy
4063040	4068480	theory but people shouldn't have been like kicked out of the internet for saying it i think i think
4068480	4074560	the issue is that when the original the original person who talked about it being a lab leak was
4074560	4080320	not talking about it being a a malicious lab leak right the person who was initially saying that it
4080320	4086640	was it could have been a leak from from one of the labs was saying that basically they were known um
4086720	4092880	for for going into bat caves without the proper gear and they were known for not wearing the
4092880	4098880	proper gear when taking samples from different places and that um and that it may have been a
4098880	4107040	leak um through i guess just just over exposure and and you know not enough protective gear right
4107680	4114320	i think that's what it was basically so it was like a negligence leak and not not like a man-made
4114320	4120560	virus that was leaked out into the world it was just they were doing testing on um on these
4120560	4127040	different caves and these different areas and uh and probably were not um following the safest
4127040	4133120	protocol um but i think i think there's a huge difference between saying that and then saying
4133120	4139760	that like it was man-made the cdc funded the you know funded it the cdc funded it and created it
4140000	4144320	and unleashed it upon us and all of that right i think there's a huge difference
4145120	4150320	yeah yeah i completely agree with you i think that there's like there's a shredding of social
4150320	4155360	trust when it comes to what you're allowed to say online right now like for example on unlike
4156720	4163520	on right-wing twitter you can see like a 10-minute collage of people who are democratic party members
4163600	4170880	and like elected people even biden and hillary um this 10-minute collage of them openly saying
4170880	4176720	that donald trump didn't win 2016 and it's like well jesus christ we've been talking about how
4176720	4181760	dangerous it is to how dangerous it is to democracy to deny the 2020 election what have
4181760	4186400	you guys been doing for four fucking years you know like on the right there's this deep sense
4186400	4191200	that everything is just hypocritical right now and that people aren't playing by the same rules
4191200	4196000	and it's like what the fuck so like yeah i don't fully agree with them but i get where they're
4196000	4201200	coming from i understand where they're coming from but again like hillary didn't take a whole
4201200	4207840	long time to concede she she conceded the next day yeah you know so yeah she conceded the next day
4207840	4213120	um and you know whether or not she said well i won the popular vote well the popular vote doesn't
4213120	4217920	really matter right like we know the way that the election works um well i i think i think one of
4217920	4222400	the clips though was like in 2018 where she's like donald trump is an illegitimate president
4222400	4227040	she's like outright says like jesus christ like come on that's a bit irresponsible yeah yeah
4227040	4232640	stupid for her to say that yeah i think i might do a video on that because i do know at least some
4232640	4236880	people on the on the center left watch me so i want to i want to like expose both sides to what
4236880	4240640	they're missing you know what i mean that's kind of been my goal from the channel recently sure
4240640	4245680	i think that i think that's a you know really fair thing to say and i'm willing to concede that like
4245680	4249680	you know she's said things that maybe she shouldn't have said there are things that
4249680	4253520	democratic candidates have said that they shouldn't have said but like when it comes
4253520	4259840	down to the actual actions at least she conceded the next day at least she didn't um uh end up
4259840	4265760	suing like you know trying to sue a whole bunch of states and and stirring up a whole bunch of
4266400	4273760	um people who who honestly feel like um the rug was pulled from under them and
4276880	4283280	honestly you know feel like they have to fight you know the government basically right like i
4283280	4288560	feel like at least she didn't do that i feel like there's a there's still a difference in like the
4288560	4294880	amount of of extremes that both sides are going to i don't know no i agree i agree with you yeah
4294880	4302880	in the end you know there's something that you say two years later on cnn to rile your base
4302880	4305920	up and then there's what you actually file in court those are two different things for sure
4305920	4312640	yeah and and you know also just regarding the whole russian thing like i kind of um i kind of
4312640	4319040	side with like what julia yafi has said on it um and she said that basically like the russian uh
4319040	4327280	like the fsb um them finding what they found like with the emails or whatever um was kind of
4327280	4333760	like a fluke accident right it wasn't like they were trying to make hillary lose the election
4333760	4341120	they they weren't sure like how how effective they would be um in in hurting her campaign
4341680	4347600	um but it ended up like it was like they she describes it as like when you're trying to like
4349040	4355280	uh push push a bully back right or push a bully and you're trying to like um you're trying to
4355280	4360160	show them who's you know that you're like you can push them around a little bit but then you end up
4360160	4366400	accidentally pushing them a you know just a little bit the wrong way and they end up like breaking
4366400	4370560	their nose you never meant to break their nose right like they fall and they break their nose
4370560	4375040	and there's blood everywhere and she's like it's kind of she describes it kind of like that like
4375040	4379360	they meant to kind of like just kind of shove hillary a little bit and they ended up pushing
4379360	4384960	her and like her falling over and breaking her nose so that's kind of like what the whole like
4384960	4389680	email shit ended up being so right yeah yeah yeah i don't know if i described that correctly i'm
4389680	4394720	sorry i'm really no i got it i got it i think i know what you're saying yeah yeah i i do have
4394720	4400080	to go though because it's it is bedtime and my girlfriend's already in bed so okay well have a
