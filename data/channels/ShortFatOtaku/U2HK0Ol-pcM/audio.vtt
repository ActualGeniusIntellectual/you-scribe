00:00.000 --> 00:06.440
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, champion of gender equality, dies at 87, and I was

00:06.440 --> 00:09.120
happy that I was able to say that properly because the past four times

00:09.120 --> 00:14.920
I've said Ruth Vader Ginsburg. That's not to say that I don't have any respect

00:14.920 --> 00:18.960
for this woman, I do. She spent most of her adult life serving her country, and

00:18.960 --> 00:22.320
even if you disagree with her politics or you don't know what should happen now

00:22.320 --> 00:27.280
that she's gone, we can at the very least be decent people, recognize the body of

00:27.440 --> 00:31.560
her life's work, and understand that regardless of politics, somebody's dead.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.400
Her family is obviously in mourning, she wasn't an evil person even if you

00:35.400 --> 00:39.120
disagreed with her, so let's at least come at the situation with a little bit

00:39.120 --> 00:42.840
of respect. And yes, I know I'm calling for respect even though I started the

00:42.840 --> 00:46.760
video with a joke, but that really wasn't at her expense. And to be honest, on a lot

00:46.760 --> 00:50.740
of social issues I actually sided with Ginsburg. Gender equality, of course. I'm

00:50.740 --> 00:56.200
pro-choice as well, pro-gay marriage. There are a lot of more left-leaning

00:56.240 --> 01:00.800
rulings coming out of the court that I just can't object to, in fact I directly

01:00.800 --> 01:05.280
support, because a lot of them were simply issues of human rights, of equal

01:05.280 --> 01:10.160
access to public services. Of course, she was also routinely anti Second Amendment,

01:10.160 --> 01:15.160
which is a valid reason as to why some people did not like her rulings. But

01:15.160 --> 01:18.640
regardless, she still did what she thought was right. She wrote well

01:18.640 --> 01:22.000
reasoned opinions during her time on the court, and I think it's fair to say that

01:22.200 --> 01:27.800
she acted honorably in her position. So you will be missed. Of course, back here

01:27.800 --> 01:33.160
in the land of the living, absolutely everybody is losing their minds. If they

01:33.160 --> 01:40.120
even try to replace RBG, we burn the entire fucking thing down. Firstly, um, I

01:40.120 --> 01:45.760
almost read this as RGB. I'm probably watching too much Linus Tech Tips. But

01:45.760 --> 01:49.720
dude, there's been like riots for the past four months now. People on the left

01:49.720 --> 01:54.080
have been constantly burning and reburning down their own neighborhoods.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.600
Do you think this is how you win the election? Do you think people are

01:57.600 --> 02:01.640
seriously going to give in to a threat like this? You've been trying it for four

02:01.640 --> 02:05.720
months, and the polls are showing your guys aren't gonna win. Why are you

02:05.720 --> 02:11.400
doubling down on this nonsense? Over our dead bodies, literally. You don't want to

02:11.400 --> 02:16.400
make that your terms, man. You do not want to make that your terms. The only solace

02:16.400 --> 02:19.680
I can take tonight is that if anyone is capable of helping us from the other

02:19.680 --> 02:24.320
side, it's RBG. If she wants to haunt Mitch McConnell and other Senate

02:24.320 --> 02:27.880
Republicans for a few months, I'm cool with that too. Thank you for everything,

02:27.880 --> 02:35.280
Justice Ginsburg. And there's a white power fist? Alright. But dude, I guess

02:35.280 --> 02:38.720
they're gonna try and summon her back from beyond the grave. Listen, alright,

02:38.720 --> 02:43.600
don't don't bring her back to hell world, okay? If McConnell jams someone through,

02:43.600 --> 02:48.640
which he will, there will be riots. How is that any different from the current

02:48.640 --> 02:52.800
state of affairs? Ruth Bader Ginsburg just died. Might as well kill myself

02:52.800 --> 02:57.400
before I'm forced through conversion therapy. I mean, if Mike Pence hasn't

02:57.400 --> 03:01.200
made his electrodes mandatory after four years, it's probably not gonna happen. If

03:01.200 --> 03:05.440
the Democrats don't fight, the people are gonna have to march on Washington and

03:05.440 --> 03:10.880
shut it down ourselves. Yeah, good luck with that one, dude. Let me know

03:10.880 --> 03:14.920
how marching on the White House turns out for you. Fuck you, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

03:14.920 --> 03:19.280
Fuck you for not retiring under Obama. Fuck you for dying under Trump. Fuck you.

03:19.280 --> 03:24.760
Fuck you. Fuck you. Leftist, feminist, vegan, epidemiologist, coomer, she slash her.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.720
You know, even I gave her more respect than you did at the start of this video.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.640
Honestly, if Trump steals a second term with minority support and ends up with a

03:33.640 --> 03:38.680
6-3 court with Thomas Alito, Gorch, Kavanaugh, and some other wingnut, it

03:38.680 --> 03:42.000
would be time to think hard about getting out. Especially the Jews. This

03:42.000 --> 03:45.880
never ends well for us. And dude, just wait until you hear what the socialists

03:45.880 --> 03:50.240
think of Jewish people. I hope the men of the world know that if Roe vs. Wade

03:50.240 --> 03:54.580
gets repealed, I'm not having sex with any of them. Also, fuck. Is this an

03:54.580 --> 04:00.440
admission that your only valuable aspect is your vagina? Ruth Bader Ginsburg was

04:00.440 --> 04:04.960
America's Dumbledore, and now nothing stands between America and its Voldemort.

04:04.960 --> 04:09.960
Thank you, Vice. Thank you for continuing the slow degradation of journalistic

04:09.960 --> 04:14.760
integrity's corpse. Here's a worldwide-renowned melting-clock artist, Joe

04:14.760 --> 04:18.660
Biden. Let me be clear, the voters should pick a president and that president

04:18.660 --> 04:22.240
should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg. Now the election's what, like,

04:22.240 --> 04:25.920
less than two months away? It is cutting it pretty close to select a new court

04:25.920 --> 04:31.840
justice. But men, I've heard this before, haven't I? Oh yeah, the Republicans, in

04:31.840 --> 04:36.540
their infinite stupidity, said the exact same thing that Joe Biden is saying now

04:36.540 --> 04:40.620
when there was a spot to fill on the Supreme Court back in 2016. And here's

04:40.620 --> 04:44.500
what President Obama had to say about that. When there is a vacancy on the

04:44.500 --> 04:52.020
Supreme Court, the President of the United States is to nominate someone. The Senate

04:52.020 --> 04:59.260
is to consider that nomination. Either they disapprove of that nominee or that

04:59.260 --> 05:05.540
nominee is elevated to the Supreme Court. Historically, this has not been viewed

05:05.540 --> 05:15.540
as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on

05:15.540 --> 05:21.180
off years. That's not in the constitutional text. I'm amused when I

05:21.180 --> 05:27.620
hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution, suddenly

05:27.620 --> 05:33.100
reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there. There is

05:33.100 --> 05:40.620
more than enough time for the Senate to consider, in a thoughtful way, the record

05:40.620 --> 05:45.940
of a nominee that I present and to make a decision. And it seems like the irony

05:45.940 --> 05:49.980
is lost on everybody right now. Here's Chuck Schumer back in 2016.

05:49.980 --> 05:55.480
Attention GOP, Senate has confirmed 17 SCOTUS justices in presidential election

05:55.480 --> 06:00.580
years. Do your job. Here's Chuck Schumer today. The American people should have a

06:00.580 --> 06:04.420
voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this

06:04.420 --> 06:07.740
vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. There's no

06:07.740 --> 06:11.100
consistency here, it's just whatever happens to benefit you at the time, eh? And

06:11.100 --> 06:15.040
the thing is, if Republicans did actually decide to try and ram through a new

06:15.040 --> 06:19.140
justice in the two months that they have left for the election, I'm not even sure

06:19.140 --> 06:24.500
if the Democrats could stop them. Because back in 2013, the Democrats used their

06:24.500 --> 06:28.960
power then to change the procedures within the Senate. Rule 22 of Senate

06:28.960 --> 06:33.960
procedure requires that three-fifths of all senators agree to end a filibuster.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.000
In other words, if one senator wanted to stall out a proceeding indefinitely, it

06:39.000 --> 06:43.840
would take 60 other senators to vote to stop him. Under the new rule, voted on by

06:43.840 --> 06:48.200
the Democrat majority Senate, it would take only 50 senators and not 60 to

06:48.200 --> 06:51.640
break a filibuster. This applied to everything with the exception of Supreme

06:51.640 --> 06:55.600
Court justices. Back then, Mitch McConnell had this to say about the Democrats

06:55.600 --> 06:58.880
blatantly changing the rules to make it more favorable to them.

07:25.600 --> 07:53.680
And he was right, because in 2017, the Senate, now run by mostly Republicans, was able to build upon that 2013 rule change and lower the requirement to 50 senators for

07:53.680 --> 07:57.880
Supreme Court justice nominations as well. And had that change not happened,

07:57.880 --> 08:02.320
well, the Senate would be in a much better position to block any potential

08:02.320 --> 08:07.280
Trump nominee that comes up between now and the election. These people truly

08:07.280 --> 08:10.680
don't understand that you can't simply change the rules to make it more

08:10.680 --> 08:14.960
advantageous for you, because the minute you're out of power, your opponents will

08:14.960 --> 08:19.000
use those same rules against you. Again, this is why you can't give the

08:19.000 --> 08:22.560
government extreme amounts of power, because the minute that somebody you

08:22.560 --> 08:26.280
don't like gets voted in, that power is going to be used in a way that you don't

08:26.280 --> 08:31.080
want. It is restriction of government power that prevents all of this, not the

08:31.080 --> 08:34.600
expansion of it. I do think it's important to talk about this mentality

08:34.600 --> 08:38.560
though. Fuck, now Trump's gonna destroy everything. Women's rights, immigrant

08:38.560 --> 08:43.000
rights, LGBT rights will be gone with her. We lost our last hope. Well, this

08:43.000 --> 08:47.160
individual here is obviously cancerous as fuck, but I don't blame him, he's only 17.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.600
But let's discuss the actual idea here, not the person. Does this mean that

08:51.640 --> 08:55.360
suddenly Roe vs. Wade is going to disappear? Even though in my opinion

08:55.360 --> 08:59.240
it's not a great way to do abortion rights, no, it probably won't just vanish

08:59.240 --> 09:03.120
overnight. People on the right thinking that it will, they're idiots. People on the

09:03.120 --> 09:07.600
left crying about it, you're also idiots. That is not how things work. The two

09:07.600 --> 09:11.280
Supreme Court justices that have come out of Trump's administration have not

09:11.280 --> 09:15.480
been a far-right fascists or whatever. There was like a centrist and a slightly

09:15.480 --> 09:19.200
center-right guy. People who are not outside of the realm of acceptable

09:19.200 --> 09:23.760
politics. In fact, one of Kavanaugh's first actions was to side with the

09:23.760 --> 09:28.440
liberal side of the bench. Even if Trump were to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg with

09:28.440 --> 09:31.240
somebody who was a bit more right-leaning than her, would women's

09:31.240 --> 09:36.880
rights go? I don't think so. Would LGBT rights go? If we're talking about gay

09:36.880 --> 09:40.320
marriage, I also don't think so. I think that's a subtle issue. And to be frank, if

09:40.320 --> 09:44.840
I actually thought that gay marriage in the States was at risk, then I would be

09:44.840 --> 09:49.360
objecting far more than I am now. Because no, rightoids, gay marriage is just fine.

09:49.360 --> 09:53.600
Immigrant rights. Well, we actually might see a dismantling of DACA, finally. And

09:53.600 --> 09:57.080
maybe you like that, maybe you don't. Personally, I do think that you should be

09:57.080 --> 10:01.520
a citizen of a country or, you know, legally invited in in order to reside in

10:01.520 --> 10:06.440
that country. So if by immigrant rights you mean the right to freely flow across

10:06.440 --> 10:10.160
the border, maybe bringing drugs, maybe bringing weapons, maybe trafficking

10:10.160 --> 10:15.080
people, or even just best-case scenario, coming across to live a life as an

10:15.080 --> 10:19.920
illegal immigrant, yeah, that's not a right. And that should be curtailed. But

10:19.920 --> 10:24.080
there is serious worry coming out of the left, and you know, I kind of get it. They

10:24.080 --> 10:27.520
still think they're fighting the old religious right. They still think the

10:27.520 --> 10:31.440
right wing of politics is run by people like Pat Robertson or Newt Gingrich or

10:31.440 --> 10:35.320
Rush Limbaugh. You know, these these nut cases who are out there talking about

10:35.320 --> 10:40.600
Jesus, or alternatively the Warhawk neo-cons like Bush and Cheney. But that

10:40.600 --> 10:44.360
isn't what the right is anymore. And those reasonable people in the center

10:44.360 --> 10:47.840
and the center-left have recognized that that's not what the right is anymore,

10:47.840 --> 10:53.200
which is why the left is losing to them. And in terms of the real politic of the

10:53.200 --> 10:57.600
situation, if the Democrats could have forced through their SCOTUS pick in 2016,

10:57.600 --> 11:01.360
they would have. But they did not have the power to do so. Right now the

11:01.560 --> 11:05.640
Republicans do. They might even try it. Actually, in my opinion, it might actually

11:05.640 --> 11:09.840
be a bad idea to try it, because what is going to lose this election for the left

11:09.840 --> 11:14.440
is the complete demoralization within the Democratic Party right now. Nobody

11:14.440 --> 11:18.640
wanted Biden, yet here he is. He's a complete fucking shambling nightmare.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.760
Among those people who don't hate Trump, most of them completely love him, and

11:22.760 --> 11:26.800
there have been a few things still on the table that could actually help tilt

11:26.800 --> 11:31.040
the election in the Democrats' favor. One of them is like if Trump had a stroke or

11:31.040 --> 11:34.080
Trump died or something, because he's kind of an older man. Another one is a

11:34.080 --> 11:38.360
massive second wave of coronavirus. And another one is the death of a Supreme

11:38.360 --> 11:44.360
Court justice. This just might galvanize the left enough to get out there and try

11:44.360 --> 11:49.000
to get Biden into office. So if you're an American and you want to see Trump win,

11:49.000 --> 11:54.240
this is the tipping point. This is where all hell breaks loose. This is that final

11:54.240 --> 11:58.560
crisis at the 11th hour. So if you want Trump to win, you've got to get out there

11:58.560 --> 12:03.480
and make sure that he does. And although I am not a Trump superfan, I would take

12:03.480 --> 12:07.440
him over anything the left is putting out right now. Alright guys, I'll talk to

12:07.440 --> 12:10.840
you later. I love you.
