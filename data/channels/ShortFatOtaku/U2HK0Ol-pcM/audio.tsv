0	6440	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, champion of gender equality, dies at 87, and I was
6440	9120	happy that I was able to say that properly because the past four times
9120	14920	I've said Ruth Vader Ginsburg. That's not to say that I don't have any respect
14920	18960	for this woman, I do. She spent most of her adult life serving her country, and
18960	22320	even if you disagree with her politics or you don't know what should happen now
22320	27280	that she's gone, we can at the very least be decent people, recognize the body of
27440	31560	her life's work, and understand that regardless of politics, somebody's dead.
31560	35400	Her family is obviously in mourning, she wasn't an evil person even if you
35400	39120	disagreed with her, so let's at least come at the situation with a little bit
39120	42840	of respect. And yes, I know I'm calling for respect even though I started the
42840	46760	video with a joke, but that really wasn't at her expense. And to be honest, on a lot
46760	50740	of social issues I actually sided with Ginsburg. Gender equality, of course. I'm
50740	56200	pro-choice as well, pro-gay marriage. There are a lot of more left-leaning
56240	60800	rulings coming out of the court that I just can't object to, in fact I directly
60800	65280	support, because a lot of them were simply issues of human rights, of equal
65280	70160	access to public services. Of course, she was also routinely anti Second Amendment,
70160	75160	which is a valid reason as to why some people did not like her rulings. But
75160	78640	regardless, she still did what she thought was right. She wrote well
78640	82000	reasoned opinions during her time on the court, and I think it's fair to say that
82200	87800	she acted honorably in her position. So you will be missed. Of course, back here
87800	93160	in the land of the living, absolutely everybody is losing their minds. If they
93160	100120	even try to replace RBG, we burn the entire fucking thing down. Firstly, um, I
100120	105760	almost read this as RGB. I'm probably watching too much Linus Tech Tips. But
105760	109720	dude, there's been like riots for the past four months now. People on the left
109720	114080	have been constantly burning and reburning down their own neighborhoods.
114080	117600	Do you think this is how you win the election? Do you think people are
117600	121640	seriously going to give in to a threat like this? You've been trying it for four
121640	125720	months, and the polls are showing your guys aren't gonna win. Why are you
125720	131400	doubling down on this nonsense? Over our dead bodies, literally. You don't want to
131400	136400	make that your terms, man. You do not want to make that your terms. The only solace
136400	139680	I can take tonight is that if anyone is capable of helping us from the other
139680	144320	side, it's RBG. If she wants to haunt Mitch McConnell and other Senate
144320	147880	Republicans for a few months, I'm cool with that too. Thank you for everything,
147880	155280	Justice Ginsburg. And there's a white power fist? Alright. But dude, I guess
155280	158720	they're gonna try and summon her back from beyond the grave. Listen, alright,
158720	163600	don't don't bring her back to hell world, okay? If McConnell jams someone through,
163600	168640	which he will, there will be riots. How is that any different from the current
168640	172800	state of affairs? Ruth Bader Ginsburg just died. Might as well kill myself
172800	177400	before I'm forced through conversion therapy. I mean, if Mike Pence hasn't
177400	181200	made his electrodes mandatory after four years, it's probably not gonna happen. If
181200	185440	the Democrats don't fight, the people are gonna have to march on Washington and
185440	190880	shut it down ourselves. Yeah, good luck with that one, dude. Let me know
190880	194920	how marching on the White House turns out for you. Fuck you, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
194920	199280	Fuck you for not retiring under Obama. Fuck you for dying under Trump. Fuck you.
199280	204760	Fuck you. Fuck you. Leftist, feminist, vegan, epidemiologist, coomer, she slash her.
204760	208720	You know, even I gave her more respect than you did at the start of this video.
208720	213640	Honestly, if Trump steals a second term with minority support and ends up with a
213640	218680	6-3 court with Thomas Alito, Gorch, Kavanaugh, and some other wingnut, it
218680	222000	would be time to think hard about getting out. Especially the Jews. This
222000	225880	never ends well for us. And dude, just wait until you hear what the socialists
225880	230240	think of Jewish people. I hope the men of the world know that if Roe vs. Wade
230240	234580	gets repealed, I'm not having sex with any of them. Also, fuck. Is this an
234580	240440	admission that your only valuable aspect is your vagina? Ruth Bader Ginsburg was
240440	244960	America's Dumbledore, and now nothing stands between America and its Voldemort.
244960	249960	Thank you, Vice. Thank you for continuing the slow degradation of journalistic
249960	254760	integrity's corpse. Here's a worldwide-renowned melting-clock artist, Joe
254760	258660	Biden. Let me be clear, the voters should pick a president and that president
258660	262240	should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg. Now the election's what, like,
262240	265920	less than two months away? It is cutting it pretty close to select a new court
265920	271840	justice. But men, I've heard this before, haven't I? Oh yeah, the Republicans, in
271840	276540	their infinite stupidity, said the exact same thing that Joe Biden is saying now
276540	280620	when there was a spot to fill on the Supreme Court back in 2016. And here's
280620	284500	what President Obama had to say about that. When there is a vacancy on the
284500	292020	Supreme Court, the President of the United States is to nominate someone. The Senate
292020	299260	is to consider that nomination. Either they disapprove of that nominee or that
299260	305540	nominee is elevated to the Supreme Court. Historically, this has not been viewed
305540	315540	as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on
315540	321180	off years. That's not in the constitutional text. I'm amused when I
321180	327620	hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution, suddenly
327620	333100	reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there. There is
333100	340620	more than enough time for the Senate to consider, in a thoughtful way, the record
340620	345940	of a nominee that I present and to make a decision. And it seems like the irony
345940	349980	is lost on everybody right now. Here's Chuck Schumer back in 2016.
349980	355480	Attention GOP, Senate has confirmed 17 SCOTUS justices in presidential election
355480	360580	years. Do your job. Here's Chuck Schumer today. The American people should have a
360580	364420	voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this
364420	367740	vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. There's no
367740	371100	consistency here, it's just whatever happens to benefit you at the time, eh? And
371100	375040	the thing is, if Republicans did actually decide to try and ram through a new
375040	379140	justice in the two months that they have left for the election, I'm not even sure
379140	384500	if the Democrats could stop them. Because back in 2013, the Democrats used their
384500	388960	power then to change the procedures within the Senate. Rule 22 of Senate
388960	393960	procedure requires that three-fifths of all senators agree to end a filibuster.
393960	399000	In other words, if one senator wanted to stall out a proceeding indefinitely, it
399000	403840	would take 60 other senators to vote to stop him. Under the new rule, voted on by
403840	408200	the Democrat majority Senate, it would take only 50 senators and not 60 to
408200	411640	break a filibuster. This applied to everything with the exception of Supreme
411640	415600	Court justices. Back then, Mitch McConnell had this to say about the Democrats
415600	418880	blatantly changing the rules to make it more favorable to them.
445600	473680	And he was right, because in 2017, the Senate, now run by mostly Republicans, was able to build upon that 2013 rule change and lower the requirement to 50 senators for
473680	477880	Supreme Court justice nominations as well. And had that change not happened,
477880	482320	well, the Senate would be in a much better position to block any potential
482320	487280	Trump nominee that comes up between now and the election. These people truly
487280	490680	don't understand that you can't simply change the rules to make it more
490680	494960	advantageous for you, because the minute you're out of power, your opponents will
494960	499000	use those same rules against you. Again, this is why you can't give the
499000	502560	government extreme amounts of power, because the minute that somebody you
502560	506280	don't like gets voted in, that power is going to be used in a way that you don't
506280	511080	want. It is restriction of government power that prevents all of this, not the
511080	514600	expansion of it. I do think it's important to talk about this mentality
514600	518560	though. Fuck, now Trump's gonna destroy everything. Women's rights, immigrant
518560	523000	rights, LGBT rights will be gone with her. We lost our last hope. Well, this
523000	527160	individual here is obviously cancerous as fuck, but I don't blame him, he's only 17.
527160	531600	But let's discuss the actual idea here, not the person. Does this mean that
531640	535360	suddenly Roe vs. Wade is going to disappear? Even though in my opinion
535360	539240	it's not a great way to do abortion rights, no, it probably won't just vanish
539240	543120	overnight. People on the right thinking that it will, they're idiots. People on the
543120	547600	left crying about it, you're also idiots. That is not how things work. The two
547600	551280	Supreme Court justices that have come out of Trump's administration have not
551280	555480	been a far-right fascists or whatever. There was like a centrist and a slightly
555480	559200	center-right guy. People who are not outside of the realm of acceptable
559200	563760	politics. In fact, one of Kavanaugh's first actions was to side with the
563760	568440	liberal side of the bench. Even if Trump were to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg with
568440	571240	somebody who was a bit more right-leaning than her, would women's
571240	576880	rights go? I don't think so. Would LGBT rights go? If we're talking about gay
576880	580320	marriage, I also don't think so. I think that's a subtle issue. And to be frank, if
580320	584840	I actually thought that gay marriage in the States was at risk, then I would be
584840	589360	objecting far more than I am now. Because no, rightoids, gay marriage is just fine.
589360	593600	Immigrant rights. Well, we actually might see a dismantling of DACA, finally. And
593600	597080	maybe you like that, maybe you don't. Personally, I do think that you should be
597080	601520	a citizen of a country or, you know, legally invited in in order to reside in
601520	606440	that country. So if by immigrant rights you mean the right to freely flow across
606440	610160	the border, maybe bringing drugs, maybe bringing weapons, maybe trafficking
610160	615080	people, or even just best-case scenario, coming across to live a life as an
615080	619920	illegal immigrant, yeah, that's not a right. And that should be curtailed. But
619920	624080	there is serious worry coming out of the left, and you know, I kind of get it. They
624080	627520	still think they're fighting the old religious right. They still think the
627520	631440	right wing of politics is run by people like Pat Robertson or Newt Gingrich or
631440	635320	Rush Limbaugh. You know, these these nut cases who are out there talking about
635320	640600	Jesus, or alternatively the Warhawk neo-cons like Bush and Cheney. But that
640600	644360	isn't what the right is anymore. And those reasonable people in the center
644360	647840	and the center-left have recognized that that's not what the right is anymore,
647840	653200	which is why the left is losing to them. And in terms of the real politic of the
653200	657600	situation, if the Democrats could have forced through their SCOTUS pick in 2016,
657600	661360	they would have. But they did not have the power to do so. Right now the
661560	665640	Republicans do. They might even try it. Actually, in my opinion, it might actually
665640	669840	be a bad idea to try it, because what is going to lose this election for the left
669840	674440	is the complete demoralization within the Democratic Party right now. Nobody
674440	678640	wanted Biden, yet here he is. He's a complete fucking shambling nightmare.
678640	682760	Among those people who don't hate Trump, most of them completely love him, and
682760	686800	there have been a few things still on the table that could actually help tilt
686800	691040	the election in the Democrats' favor. One of them is like if Trump had a stroke or
691040	694080	Trump died or something, because he's kind of an older man. Another one is a
694080	698360	massive second wave of coronavirus. And another one is the death of a Supreme
698360	704360	Court justice. This just might galvanize the left enough to get out there and try
704360	709000	to get Biden into office. So if you're an American and you want to see Trump win,
709000	714240	this is the tipping point. This is where all hell breaks loose. This is that final
714240	718560	crisis at the 11th hour. So if you want Trump to win, you've got to get out there
718560	723480	and make sure that he does. And although I am not a Trump superfan, I would take
723480	727440	him over anything the left is putting out right now. Alright guys, I'll talk to
727440	730840	you later. I love you.
