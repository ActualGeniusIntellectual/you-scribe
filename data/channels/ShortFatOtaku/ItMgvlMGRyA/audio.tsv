0	9320	Okay, guys, it is time for the next harvest.
9320	13320	This is the first week of July, the lettuce still isn't ready, but everything else is
13320	14320	definitely good.
14320	18520	I'll be getting kale and peas for tonight's salad.
18520	20520	Look at those peas.
20520	22960	Wait a second.
22960	23960	Naomi?
23960	24960	Yeah?
24960	25960	Can you throw down a bowl?
25960	26960	Damn it, Dad.
26960	27960	Ow!
27960	32840	God damn it.
32840	36080	Let's see if these peas can be pulled off.
36080	40400	Kinda, but kinda not.
40400	44520	I don't want to pull too hard.
44520	45520	You know what?
45520	47520	I guess I'll have to snip them.
47520	49360	Yeah, they're looking good.
49360	51000	And now for the kale trim.
51000	55540	Well, the bowl was a bit too small, but that's okay.
55540	59500	It is incredibly stormy out here right now.
59500	62820	The new deck set is getting drenched.
62820	68420	It's an extremely warm rain, though, and that's nice.
68420	70700	Good for the garden, too.
70700	74540	So where's all that water coming from?
74540	79460	Oh, Jesus.
79460	80860	That doesn't look very good.
80860	83700	Maybe I gotta fix that.
84020	88580	Oh my lord, this has been my entire summer.
88580	92260	Nothing but monsoon season, dude.
92260	95740	I don't know if you can see it down there, but the garden is flooding.
95740	98900	I still haven't fixed that, either.
98900	100420	It's blowing into the house.
100420	101460	Here we are.
101460	105100	It's nearing the end of July at this point, and this is how the garden looks.
105100	110380	There's Naomi doing some weeding, and there's actually a lot of weeding to do.
110420	113900	A combination of things prevented us from harvesting earlier.
113900	120100	There's a lot of kale, there's a lot of chard, there's a lot of lettuce, and a fair number
120100	121100	of peas.
121100	123740	However, I am noticing some problems with the current garden.
123740	125300	That was full of weeds.
125300	130580	Maybe it's weeds, but also, like, the cucumbers should have taken off by now, and they haven't.
130580	131900	There's not many tomatoes coming in.
131900	133580	I see, like, one tomato in there.
133580	134580	They're still flowering, bro.
134580	137620	They're still flowering, but, like, they're not really going the way that they were last
137620	138620	year.
138620	140700	The kale's doing well, and the kale's doing well.
140700	145500	However, also, I think the peppers should have started up earlier, too.
145500	148820	Maybe it's because of how wet it's been this summer?
148820	151220	Maybe it's because of how hot it's been this summer?
151220	152220	Who knows?
152220	153620	Hot and wet, and sometimes cold.
153620	154620	Wet, hot American summer.
154620	155620	Meh.
155620	158340	I have a feeling this might not be a great garden this year.
158340	159340	Nope.
159340	160620	But at the very least, tonight, we'll be able to-
160620	161620	Can you move the lettuce?
161620	162620	Wow, Naomi.
162620	163620	Can you just move it?
163620	165620	How many weeds have you thrown in there?
165620	166620	None, actually.
166620	167620	That was the first one.
167620	168620	I'm sure.
168620	173300	And I'll come back down tonight to collect peas for the salad.
173300	175460	Right now, I've got to harvest all this kale, man.
175460	176460	There's too much of it.
176460	177460	And look at that.
177460	179380	That's a lot of kale I've got to pick up now.
179380	181340	How many bags will that be?
181340	182340	Three or four?
182340	184460	I accidentally threw it, and even though it was so far away.
184460	185460	I moved it.
185460	186460	Are you kidding me?
186460	187460	I'm sorry.
187460	189460	It was a gentle toss.
189460	190460	Yeah?
190460	191460	You know what?
191460	192460	Don't-
192460	193460	Deserved.
193460	194460	What?
194460	195460	Don't.
195460	196460	That's good.
196460	197460	That's good.
197460	198460	That's good.
198460	201460	There we go.
201460	203700	Four bags of kale, ready to be frozen.
203700	205420	I'm going to eat this out of the garden now.
205420	206820	I'm going to help Naomi with the weeding.
206820	208140	There she is.
208140	214420	And you can see, there's a few small tomatoes coming in, but not really that many.
214420	221700	Also, the cucumbers are growing very slowly, and the roots, not the roots, but the early
221700	222980	part of the vine is very white.
222980	225140	I don't know what's going on there.
225140	230780	At the same time, it was like the same problems overtaking the peas, but at least they produced
230780	233140	more peas, and they lasted longer this year, you know?
233140	234780	There's one dead vine in there already.
234780	239820	They didn't grow as tall as they did, but they are producing more peas, and that's nice.
239820	242140	So I guess I'll look at all those weeds.
242140	243140	I'll get to weeding then.
243140	245140	Wait, Naomi, you're sitting on a plant?
245140	246140	No.
246140	247140	Just move your feed for a minute.
247140	248140	I'm not.
248140	251460	There's a really tiny plant that's barely alive in there.
251460	252460	Wait, did you pull it out?
252460	253460	No.
253460	254460	There's no plant here.
254780	255780	No, there actually is.
255780	256780	Seriously.
256780	257780	Okay.
257780	258780	Oh, no.
258780	260780	Yeah, it's right there.
260780	261780	See?
261780	262780	There it is.
262780	264940	It's a really tiny kale trying to recover.
264940	266980	There's a little bit of growth in there.
266980	267980	See that?
267980	268980	Don't step on the plants, Dev.
268980	269980	I won't.
269980	270980	I don't believe you.
270980	273980	Is this the second kale plant that you've murdered, Naomi?
273980	274980	Yes.
274980	279820	I hate kale secretly, even though I eat it all the time, so I just murder kale plants
279820	281620	because it brings joy to my life.
281620	283620	I have a feeling that one's not coming back at this point, eh?
283780	284780	Probably not.
284780	285780	Oh, well.
285780	287780	Okay, Naomi's going to get some water, and we're done.
287780	288780	Don't fall.
288780	292780	So, we're finished with weeding for the most part.
292780	294780	It looks a lot better.
294780	296780	We have all the kale.
296780	299780	I pushed some of the vines towards going up the lattice.
299780	301780	Hopefully, it'll be okay.
301780	303780	I don't know about the garden this year.
303780	304780	I don't know.
304780	305780	It might not be so good.
305780	308780	Maybe I put the tomatoes too close together.
308780	310780	The peas always seem to die.
310780	312780	I don't quite know why.
312940	316540	She accidentally dug up a root of the peas while weeding, so she theorized that maybe
316540	322280	what's going on with the peas is that we're not watering them deep enough so the roots
322280	323980	aren't going deeply.
323980	328380	Maybe that's the problem, but other things seem to be going very well.
328380	334940	We'll grab some of the Swiss chard and the peas tonight and the lettuce for salads, and
334940	335940	it'll be a-okay.
335940	337940	Can you see that?
337940	339860	That's a spider web in the garden.
339940	345100	I have not been around much this summer, and the garden has become, well, it's gotten away
345100	347100	from me a bit.
347100	350100	Anyway, here's what's been going on.
350100	354540	The lettuce is going crazy, but now the lettuce is bolting, and this is entirely my fault.
354540	360200	I just haven't trimmed it, haven't been around, but hopefully, if I cut it down again, it
360200	361200	should be okay.
361200	363260	It's time for another trim of the kale.
363260	365220	It's definitely time to start eating the chard.
365220	369820	There's a pepper coming in finally, and over there, see that red?
369820	370820	There's a tomato.
370820	372260	The cucumbers aren't doing so well.
372260	374660	There's one cucumber there, but generally the vines aren't going.
374660	376180	I don't know what happened this year.
376180	380700	There's still peas, and they're still growing, but they didn't really take off the way that
380700	381700	they did in previous years.
381700	384100	At least they got a lot of peas out of them though, so that's okay.
384100	387320	They actually lasted longer than previous years, which is surprising.
387320	393980	The garden overall is not doing nearly as well, hi Naomi, is not doing nearly as well
393980	395220	as previous years.
395220	396960	I don't quite know why.
397000	400740	The kale and the lettuce are the things that really, really worked out.
400740	404760	Everything else is kind of working out, but it's still worse than last year.
404760	409560	Also, look, that tiny kale is slowly coming back.
409560	413640	This time, I just brought a giant pot because there's too much to harvest.
420280	422240	Jesus, it's filled the whole pot.
422240	423240	Same thing with the chard.
423360	427960	I haven't trimmed one of these on camera before, so I think you just get in there, snip the
427960	434240	stalk, get a bunch of chard leaves.
434240	435240	That's a big leaf.
435240	444480	All right, well, I guess I'll just trim again like so and hope that it won't keep making
444480	445480	seeds.
445480	451120	You basically just cut it like grass if you're cutting your lawn with scissors.
451120	453000	These are all cut.
453000	454560	Let's hope they continue to grow back.
454560	459020	Maybe so I can pick off some of these lower leaves too.
459020	460020	These guys here.
460020	461020	Yeah.
461020	464040	That was a few blades of grass in there.
464040	465560	That's okay, we'll figure it out.
465560	466560	There it is.
466560	468960	Just a big pot of leaves.
468960	471240	Naomi, look at this.
471240	476320	That's a weird looking stew, Dev.
476320	480000	It's the first week of September, we're coming up to the end of the garden and it is not
480000	481000	looking good.
481000	482840	Peas always die around this time of year.
482840	483840	That's fine.
483840	484840	Expected.
484840	485840	We got our share of peas out of them.
485840	487120	The lettuce was a success for the most part.
487120	488760	The two chard plants worked out.
488760	490160	The kale, as always, was amazing.
490160	491160	We've got to cut it again.
491160	496400	We only got a few decently big peppers out of them this time, like this one, for example.
496400	497940	That one didn't take off at all.
497940	502560	The cucumbers just never grew and there's like one little tiny cucumber there.
502560	504480	I don't know what happened.
504480	506480	The tomatoes have been hit and miss.
506480	510840	Firstly, whenever there's a red one, not so much this time, but for the most part, whenever
510840	512720	there's a red one, an animal goes to eat it.
512720	515880	That one's been eaten by an animal, probably like a chipmunk or something.
515880	520120	Secondly, this small one fell on the ground, so I took it off, hoping it would ripen up.
520120	522200	But instead of ripen up, it just rotted from the inside.
522200	527700	If I pull off all those green tomatoes and if they don't rot, like this one did, we might
527700	529580	get half what we got last year.
529580	533560	We are in the second week of September.
533560	535600	Naomi's gathering up the kale right now.
535600	536600	You missed her feet.
536600	538360	She was changing her shoes.
538360	539760	You missed the Naomi feet pics.
539760	542100	Cut your toes off, Dev.
542100	545320	We have frost coming, so it's time to pull off whatever we can pull off.
545320	548000	This sucks because like, it's coming this week.
548000	549600	It's coming with all the rain.
549600	551840	I guess the garden just didn't work out this year, guys.
551840	553400	I'm not happy about it, but.
553400	554400	Kale did.
554400	557720	I guess if you live in Northern Ontario, there's gross shit tons of kale.
557720	558720	Yeah.
558720	559720	Kale always works out.
559720	563040	Dude, even that, that one that I stomped on like made a slight comeback.
563040	564040	Yeah.
564040	565040	You can get like four leaves out of that.
565040	566040	Yeah.
566040	568440	Got the, uh, the old snippers.
569440	571840	These are pretty dull at this point, but they're also like seven years old.
571840	572840	Yeah.
572840	574840	Yeah, I need one of those Pokemon bowls.
574840	575840	Pokemon.
575840	576840	Pokemon.
576840	578840	I'll just, uh.
578840	582440	In this case, that means produce.
582440	583440	Produce?
583440	584440	We're catching produce?
584440	585440	Yeah.
585440	586440	Look at this.
586440	588440	This tomato got so fat, it bent the vine.
588440	589440	Nice.
589440	590440	Give us the big fat tomato.
590440	593440	There's actually a lot of tomatoes on here that is all green.
593440	594440	Yeah.
594440	596440	Except for that one over there.
596440	597440	Or a red one.
597440	598440	Or a red one.
598440	599440	Like we did get a bunch.
599440	602440	This is way less than normal, but we still got a bunch of tomatoes.
602440	604440	So, like it's not a complete loss.
604440	606440	I just grabbed the only two peppers.
606440	608440	Naomi's here sniffing away.
608440	610440	And this is what I mentioned last week.
610440	611440	Some of them just rotted.
611440	612440	Some animals ate them.
612440	615440	Like, but there's still a bunch that are like okay.
615440	616440	I think we'll be fine.
616440	619440	Yeah, like there's a lot of hidden ones.
619440	620440	Like right here.
620440	621440	Yeah.
621440	622440	See, look at all those.
622440	623440	Yeah.
623440	624440	They're green, but they're big.
624440	625440	I just noticed this.
625440	626440	You see that?
626440	628440	There's like two little peas.
628440	634440	Even on this dead vine, you can still find like the final little bits.
634440	635440	I don't think I'd eat those.
635440	636440	They don't look very good.
636440	637440	But still.
637440	639440	Like, um, mines away.
639440	642440	So this is the final dregs of the lettuce.
642440	643440	As you can see.
643440	644440	They don't look good.
644440	645440	They've gone to seed.
645440	648440	Once it starts producing seeds, the lettuce gets more bitter.
648440	649440	I don't mind it.
649440	651440	Naomi doesn't complain, but it's still edible.
651440	653440	So we'll chop all these down.
653440	655440	Or Naomi will anyway.
655440	657440	And then we'll pick out all of the, uh, all the leaves.
657440	658440	Let me go to the kitchen.
658440	660440	And that'll be dinner tonight.
660440	661440	Along with this chard.
661440	663440	You know what those late chards that we bought?
663440	664440	They worked out too.
664440	665440	Oh yeah.
665440	666440	Cucumbers just didn't work.
666440	667440	I don't know why.
667440	671440	You can see in there, there's like two tiny ones and that's all we got.
671440	672440	I don't even know if there's three.
672440	675440	I don't even know if those are edible, but I'll get them just in case.
675440	677440	Maybe we'll let Dave be the guinea pig.
677440	680440	We'll just not tell him that they're dead.
680440	681440	There we go.
681440	682440	Like it's, the vine's already dead.
682440	684440	The vine's already dead.
684440	685440	There's a cucumber.
685440	686440	Jesus.
686440	689440	So there's five, five malformed cucumbers.
689440	696440	Hold up that teeny tiny round one.
696440	698440	It looks like an avocado.
698440	701440	So this is probably going to be the final haul from the garden.
701440	702440	Kind of disappointing.
702440	705440	We still got something, but it's not what I expected.
705440	706440	Here's our lettuce and our chard.
706440	712440	We've got our deformed cucumbers, three bowls of tomatoes and two final bags of kale.
712440	713440	Not Naomi's glasses.
713440	715440	We harvested Naomi's glasses.
715440	716440	No, no, no.
716440	718440	You lost them in the garden.
718440	719440	Eons ago.
719440	723440	No, I'm fixing those with the power of Flex Seal.
723440	725440	Not a paid promotion.
725440	727440	That looks pretty good, baby.
727440	731440	Give me all those plants.
731440	733440	Be careful balancing those, Naomi.
733440	735440	There's only so much room in the windowsill.
735440	737440	I got this.
737440	738440	It's fine.
738440	742440	Hey, look, this one is like, I know it's not, it's just really fat.
742440	745440	It almost looks like there was another one trying to grow.
745440	748440	It's going to fall.
748440	749440	No, no.
749440	750440	Look at that.
750440	751440	No, no.
751440	753440	Put it somewhere else.
753440	754440	Fine.
754440	756440	We have more than one windowsill in the house.
756440	757440	Nope.
757440	758440	I'm going to fit them all here.
758440	759440	All right.
759440	762440	So let's try out one of these deformed cucumbers here.
762440	765440	I mean, it's pretty seedy in there.
765440	766440	Maybe it's okay.
766440	767440	Seeds taste good.
767440	768440	Yum.
768440	769440	All right.
769440	770440	All right.
770440	772440	I don't know how I feel about this.
772440	776440	It's like not any more bad than a regular grocery store cucumber.
776440	778440	Yeah, I guess.
778440	779440	It's probably still fine.
779440	781440	It's just a cucumber.
781440	783440	Oh, it's very mushy inside.
783440	785440	That's all very mushy.
785440	787440	But this stuff is still good.
787440	789440	And here we are, the third week of September.
789440	791440	Naomi is grabbing the stuff.
791440	793440	And we did basically what we did last year.
793440	795440	We knew that frost was coming,
795440	799440	so we just let the garden be to do whatever it wanted to do.
799440	800440	We didn't water it anymore.
800440	801440	We didn't do anything to it.
801440	803440	And we're going to get the final dregs,
803440	805440	and then we're going to pull it out,
805440	808440	because I want to do something to this garden
808440	811440	after you pull everything out that will prevent this disaster
811440	812440	from happening again.
812440	813440	Naomi's very tired.
816440	818440	We've got a couple more chard leaves.
818440	820440	The kale, I bet the kale could just grow in winter.
820440	822440	There's so much.
822440	824440	It just grows in the snow.
824440	825440	We'll grab the last few peppers,
825440	827440	and we'll grab the last few tomatoes,
827440	831440	and then we're going to just yank everything out.
831440	832440	How do you unlock this?
832440	834440	You have to, like, pull this down here.
834440	835440	I tried.
835440	836440	There it goes.
836440	837440	Oh, thank you.
837440	842440	I just noticed my disaster plant actually managed to come back.
842440	843440	Hooray.
843440	845440	We can definitely garden better than Chaz.
845440	846440	Yeah.
846440	848440	Naomi just grabbed the last pepper,
848440	851440	and I just realized of these six pepper plants,
851440	853440	we got, like, four peppers.
853440	855440	There's a baby one right here.
855440	857440	There's, like, a baby one right there, too, right behind you.
857440	858440	Like a baby baby?
858440	860440	Yeah, like a tiny little pepper.
860440	863440	And there it is, the final two bowls of dregs
863440	865440	at the end of the garden this year.
865440	866440	It's starting to get cold.
866440	867440	I think it's going to rain.
867440	869440	Yeah, it's supposed to rain this afternoon.
869440	871440	Basically, we're doing this right now
871440	873440	because, like, we had a little bit of minor frost,
873440	878440	but today's rain is going to be the actual beginning of fall
878440	881440	when the Canadian winter blows in
881440	885440	and just covers the entire landscape in a giant sheet of ice,
885440	887440	and we're basically racing against time
887440	889440	before the rain at 2 o'clock.
889440	891440	It doesn't happen till late October.
891440	893440	No, I think we're going to be basically frozen
893440	895440	inside of our house for the next five months.
895440	896440	You think so, eh?
896440	898440	We're going to do something a bit special this year
898440	899440	as Naomi clears out the garden.
899440	900440	I'm going to do it, too.
900440	903440	So first, we've got to get all this stuff out of here.
903440	904440	Come on.
904440	906440	It's hard to do this one-handed.
906440	907440	Come on.
907440	908440	Ah.
908440	910440	The tomato cage, we'll store these away
910440	912440	until next year.
912440	914440	And there's the tomato plant.
914440	916440	Oh, it's still in.
916440	918440	And there you go.
918440	919440	All the plants are off.
919440	921440	Here's a big pile of plants.
921440	924440	Naomi, you think that there's a clover infestation
924440	925440	in the garden at this point, right?
925440	926440	Probably.
926440	928440	Can't see it anymore.
928440	930440	So we're going to rake off the top layer,
930440	933440	shove it into the compost, and hopefully that'll be okay.
933440	936440	What I wanted to do is to get some excess.
936440	937440	Open up again. Come on.
937440	939440	Why is this always giving me a hard time?
939440	942440	I'm going to grab that excess compost as well
942440	945440	and shove it in the garden after we've raked it off.
945440	948440	Hopefully, we can use it to rejuvenate the garden, maybe.
948440	950440	So here's all the weeds and plants and junk,
950440	953440	and I'll just grab it.
953440	955440	That's a lot of it.
955440	956440	And it's going to go in.
956440	958440	It's going to sit in the compost.
958440	959440	It's going to...
959440	961440	Grrr!
961440	963440	I'll just gigachat it.
963440	969440	It's real hard to rake one-handed.
969440	971440	Also, why am I using a leaf rake?
971440	974440	Okay, so there's a pile of the top layer
974440	977440	with all the clover bits in it,
977440	982440	and I'll just shovel it into the compost.
982440	986440	And hopefully, one year going through the composter
986440	988440	will make that soil okay again.
988440	990440	Top layer's been shoveled off?
990440	991440	Mostly.
991440	993440	There it is. It's all in there.
993440	994440	Now I think the plan is,
994440	996440	since we are missing a bunch of earth at this point,
996440	998440	I'm going to shovel out all that compost,
998440	999440	like I mentioned, right there.
999440	1001440	We can get the lettuce bed,
1001440	1005440	and also there's a bag of manure.
1007440	1009440	You okay in there?
1011440	1013440	There it is.
1013440	1015440	I'm going to assume you can't dump it in?
1015440	1017440	Probably not.
1017440	1023440	Alright, I'll just dump it in, and Naomi can layer it around.
1023440	1025440	Jesus.
1025440	1027440	It's actually not that heavy when it's two-handed,
1027440	1029440	but I've got to hold the phone.
1029440	1031440	Come on.
1031440	1034440	An extra bag of manure right into the garden,
1034440	1036440	just to rejuvenate it over the winter.
1036440	1038440	Same with this thing.
1038440	1041440	Yep, there it goes.
1041440	1044440	Oh my god, look at all the roots at the bottom.
1044440	1046440	I didn't know that there'd be that many roots.
1046440	1048440	Of course there'd be a shit ton of roots.
1048440	1050440	We just put the land in it.
1050440	1051440	Oops.
1051440	1053440	It's compost time.
1053440	1055440	Look at all those eggs.
1055440	1058440	Eggshells are apparently pretty good for a garden.
1058440	1060440	Also, we eat a lot of eggs.
1060440	1061440	There we go.
1061440	1064440	Compost on my side, manure on Naomi's.
1064440	1068440	All the compost is gone, so we'll close this up.
1068440	1070440	Come on.
1070440	1075440	And then we'll mash all this stuff down to make room.
1075440	1078440	Oh god, this is going to take a while.
1078440	1080440	Wee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
1080440	1083440	Making a compostable, which is brutal.
1083440	1086440	Wee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
1086440	1087440	Yeah.
1087440	1089440	A beautiful-looking garden ready for next year.
1089440	1091440	Once the leaves really start coming down,
1091440	1097440	I'll cover this thing with leaves in October or so.
1097440	1099440	But we did a good job.
1099440	1101440	There's Naomi holding the rake.
1101440	1103440	Hey, do you want to like, because I'm holding the shovel,
1103440	1105440	do you want to like, recreate that picture of like,
1105440	1107440	those two farmers who are like, really sour looking?
1107440	1108440	They're like, holding their tools.
1108440	1109440	We'll see you next time.
1109440	1111440	We'll see you next year, hopefully.
1111440	1113440	Unless the garden fails again.
1113440	1116440	At which point, I just won't even upload it.
1116440	1119440	Well, if it fails again, why wouldn't you upload at least one video being like,
1119440	1121440	a failed goodbye?
1121440	1122440	Next year-
1122440	1123440	No more political videos.
1123440	1126440	Next year's video is just the garden on fire.
1133440	1148440	Thanks for watching.
