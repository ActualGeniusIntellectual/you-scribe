1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
Okay, guys, it is time for the next harvest.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,320
This is the first week of July, the lettuce still isn't ready, but everything else is

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
definitely good.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,520
I'll be getting kale and peas for tonight's salad.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,520
Look at those peas.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,960
Wait a second.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,960
Naomi?

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Yeah?

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Can you throw down a bowl?

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Damn it, Dad.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
Ow!

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,840
God damn it.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,080
Let's see if these peas can be pulled off.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,400
Kinda, but kinda not.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,520
I don't want to pull too hard.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
You know what?

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
I guess I'll have to snip them.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
Yeah, they're looking good.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,000
And now for the kale trim.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,540
Well, the bowl was a bit too small, but that's okay.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,500
It is incredibly stormy out here right now.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,820
The new deck set is getting drenched.

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,420
It's an extremely warm rain, though, and that's nice.

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,700
Good for the garden, too.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,540
So where's all that water coming from?

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,460
Oh, Jesus.

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,860
That doesn't look very good.

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,700
Maybe I gotta fix that.

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,580
Oh my lord, this has been my entire summer.

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,260
Nothing but monsoon season, dude.

31
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,740
I don't know if you can see it down there, but the garden is flooding.

32
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,900
I still haven't fixed that, either.

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,420
It's blowing into the house.

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,460
Here we are.

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,100
It's nearing the end of July at this point, and this is how the garden looks.

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,380
There's Naomi doing some weeding, and there's actually a lot of weeding to do.

37
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,900
A combination of things prevented us from harvesting earlier.

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,100
There's a lot of kale, there's a lot of chard, there's a lot of lettuce, and a fair number

39
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,100
of peas.

40
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,740
However, I am noticing some problems with the current garden.

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,300
That was full of weeds.

42
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,580
Maybe it's weeds, but also, like, the cucumbers should have taken off by now, and they haven't.

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,900
There's not many tomatoes coming in.

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,580
I see, like, one tomato in there.

45
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,580
They're still flowering, bro.

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,620
They're still flowering, but, like, they're not really going the way that they were last

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
year.

48
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,700
The kale's doing well, and the kale's doing well.

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,500
However, also, I think the peppers should have started up earlier, too.

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,820
Maybe it's because of how wet it's been this summer?

51
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,220
Maybe it's because of how hot it's been this summer?

52
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,220
Who knows?

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,620
Hot and wet, and sometimes cold.

54
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,620
Wet, hot American summer.

55
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,620
Meh.

56
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,340
I have a feeling this might not be a great garden this year.

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Nope.

58
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,620
But at the very least, tonight, we'll be able to-

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
Can you move the lettuce?

60
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
Wow, Naomi.

61
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
Can you just move it?

62
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,620
How many weeds have you thrown in there?

63
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
None, actually.

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,620
That was the first one.

65
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,620
I'm sure.

66
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,300
And I'll come back down tonight to collect peas for the salad.

67
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,460
Right now, I've got to harvest all this kale, man.

68
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
There's too much of it.

69
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,460
And look at that.

70
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,380
That's a lot of kale I've got to pick up now.

71
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,340
How many bags will that be?

72
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Three or four?

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,460
I accidentally threw it, and even though it was so far away.

74
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
I moved it.

75
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,460
Are you kidding me?

76
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,460
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,460
It was a gentle toss.

78
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
Yeah?

79
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,460
You know what?

80
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Don't-

81
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
Deserved.

82
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
What?

83
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Don't.

84
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,460
That's good.

85
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
That's good.

86
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
That's good.

87
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,460
There we go.

88
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,700
Four bags of kale, ready to be frozen.

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,420
I'm going to eat this out of the garden now.

90
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,820
I'm going to help Naomi with the weeding.

91
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,140
There she is.

92
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,420
And you can see, there's a few small tomatoes coming in, but not really that many.

93
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,700
Also, the cucumbers are growing very slowly, and the roots, not the roots, but the early

94
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,980
part of the vine is very white.

95
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,140
I don't know what's going on there.

96
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,780
At the same time, it was like the same problems overtaking the peas, but at least they produced

97
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,140
more peas, and they lasted longer this year, you know?

98
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,780
There's one dead vine in there already.

99
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,820
They didn't grow as tall as they did, but they are producing more peas, and that's nice.

100
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,140
So I guess I'll look at all those weeds.

101
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
I'll get to weeding then.

102
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
Wait, Naomi, you're sitting on a plant?

103
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
No.

104
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Just move your feed for a minute.

105
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,140
I'm not.

106
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,460
There's a really tiny plant that's barely alive in there.

107
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Wait, did you pull it out?

108
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
No.

109
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
There's no plant here.

110
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,780
No, there actually is.

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,780
Seriously.

112
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,780
Okay.

113
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,780
Oh, no.

114
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,780
Yeah, it's right there.

115
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,780
See?

116
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,780
There it is.

117
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,940
It's a really tiny kale trying to recover.

118
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,980
There's a little bit of growth in there.

119
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,980
See that?

120
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Don't step on the plants, Dev.

121
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,980
I won't.

122
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
I don't believe you.

123
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,980
Is this the second kale plant that you've murdered, Naomi?

124
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Yes.

125
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,820
I hate kale secretly, even though I eat it all the time, so I just murder kale plants

126
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,620
because it brings joy to my life.

127
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,620
I have a feeling that one's not coming back at this point, eh?

128
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Probably not.

129
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,780
Oh, well.

130
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,780
Okay, Naomi's going to get some water, and we're done.

131
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,780
Don't fall.

132
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,780
So, we're finished with weeding for the most part.

133
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,780
It looks a lot better.

134
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,780
We have all the kale.

135
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,780
I pushed some of the vines towards going up the lattice.

136
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,780
Hopefully, it'll be okay.

137
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,780
I don't know about the garden this year.

138
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
I don't know.

139
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
It might not be so good.

140
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Maybe I put the tomatoes too close together.

141
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,780
The peas always seem to die.

142
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,780
I don't quite know why.

143
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,540
She accidentally dug up a root of the peas while weeding, so she theorized that maybe

144
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,280
what's going on with the peas is that we're not watering them deep enough so the roots

145
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,980
aren't going deeply.

146
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,380
Maybe that's the problem, but other things seem to be going very well.

147
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,940
We'll grab some of the Swiss chard and the peas tonight and the lettuce for salads, and

148
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
it'll be a-okay.

149
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
Can you see that?

150
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,860
That's a spider web in the garden.

151
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,100
I have not been around much this summer, and the garden has become, well, it's gotten away

152
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
from me a bit.

153
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Anyway, here's what's been going on.

154
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,540
The lettuce is going crazy, but now the lettuce is bolting, and this is entirely my fault.

155
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,200
I just haven't trimmed it, haven't been around, but hopefully, if I cut it down again, it

156
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
should be okay.

157
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,260
It's time for another trim of the kale.

158
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,220
It's definitely time to start eating the chard.

159
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,820
There's a pepper coming in finally, and over there, see that red?

160
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
There's a tomato.

161
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,260
The cucumbers aren't doing so well.

162
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,660
There's one cucumber there, but generally the vines aren't going.

163
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,180
I don't know what happened this year.

164
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,700
There's still peas, and they're still growing, but they didn't really take off the way that

165
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
they did in previous years.

166
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,100
At least they got a lot of peas out of them though, so that's okay.

167
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,320
They actually lasted longer than previous years, which is surprising.

168
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,980
The garden overall is not doing nearly as well, hi Naomi, is not doing nearly as well

169
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,220
as previous years.

170
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,960
I don't quite know why.

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,740
The kale and the lettuce are the things that really, really worked out.

172
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,760
Everything else is kind of working out, but it's still worse than last year.

173
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,560
Also, look, that tiny kale is slowly coming back.

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,640
This time, I just brought a giant pot because there's too much to harvest.

175
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,240
Jesus, it's filled the whole pot.

176
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Same thing with the chard.

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,960
I haven't trimmed one of these on camera before, so I think you just get in there, snip the

178
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,240
stalk, get a bunch of chard leaves.

179
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
That's a big leaf.

180
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:24,480
All right, well, I guess I'll just trim again like so and hope that it won't keep making

181
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
seeds.

182
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,120
You basically just cut it like grass if you're cutting your lawn with scissors.

183
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,000
These are all cut.

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Let's hope they continue to grow back.

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,020
Maybe so I can pick off some of these lower leaves too.

186
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
These guys here.

187
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Yeah.

188
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,040
That was a few blades of grass in there.

189
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,560
That's okay, we'll figure it out.

190
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
There it is.

191
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
Just a big pot of leaves.

192
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,240
Naomi, look at this.

193
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,320
That's a weird looking stew, Dev.

194
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,000
It's the first week of September, we're coming up to the end of the garden and it is not

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
looking good.

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,840
Peas always die around this time of year.

197
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
That's fine.

198
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Expected.

199
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
We got our share of peas out of them.

200
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
The lettuce was a success for the most part.

201
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,760
The two chard plants worked out.

202
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,160
The kale, as always, was amazing.

203
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
We've got to cut it again.

204
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,400
We only got a few decently big peppers out of them this time, like this one, for example.

205
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,940
That one didn't take off at all.

206
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,560
The cucumbers just never grew and there's like one little tiny cucumber there.

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,480
I don't know what happened.

208
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
The tomatoes have been hit and miss.

209
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,840
Firstly, whenever there's a red one, not so much this time, but for the most part, whenever

210
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,720
there's a red one, an animal goes to eat it.

211
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,880
That one's been eaten by an animal, probably like a chipmunk or something.

212
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,120
Secondly, this small one fell on the ground, so I took it off, hoping it would ripen up.

213
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,200
But instead of ripen up, it just rotted from the inside.

214
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,700
If I pull off all those green tomatoes and if they don't rot, like this one did, we might

215
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,580
get half what we got last year.

216
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,560
We are in the second week of September.

217
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,600
Naomi's gathering up the kale right now.

218
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
You missed her feet.

219
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,360
She was changing her shoes.

220
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,760
You missed the Naomi feet pics.

221
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,100
Cut your toes off, Dev.

222
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,320
We have frost coming, so it's time to pull off whatever we can pull off.

223
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,000
This sucks because like, it's coming this week.

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
It's coming with all the rain.

225
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,840
I guess the garden just didn't work out this year, guys.

226
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm not happy about it, but.

227
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Kale did.

228
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,720
I guess if you live in Northern Ontario, there's gross shit tons of kale.

229
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Yeah.

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Kale always works out.

231
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,040
Dude, even that, that one that I stomped on like made a slight comeback.

232
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Yeah.

233
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
You can get like four leaves out of that.

234
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Yeah.

235
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,440
Got the, uh, the old snippers.

236
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,840
These are pretty dull at this point, but they're also like seven years old.

237
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Yeah.

238
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Yeah, I need one of those Pokemon bowls.

239
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Pokemon.

240
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Pokemon.

241
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
I'll just, uh.

242
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,440
In this case, that means produce.

243
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Produce?

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
We're catching produce?

245
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah.

246
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Look at this.

247
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
This tomato got so fat, it bent the vine.

248
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Nice.

249
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Give us the big fat tomato.

250
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
There's actually a lot of tomatoes on here that is all green.

251
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Yeah.

252
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Except for that one over there.

253
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Or a red one.

254
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Or a red one.

255
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Like we did get a bunch.

256
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
This is way less than normal, but we still got a bunch of tomatoes.

257
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
So, like it's not a complete loss.

258
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
I just grabbed the only two peppers.

259
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Naomi's here sniffing away.

260
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
And this is what I mentioned last week.

261
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Some of them just rotted.

262
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Some animals ate them.

263
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Like, but there's still a bunch that are like okay.

264
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I think we'll be fine.

265
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Yeah, like there's a lot of hidden ones.

266
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Like right here.

267
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Yeah.

268
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
See, look at all those.

269
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Yeah.

270
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
They're green, but they're big.

271
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I just noticed this.

272
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
You see that?

273
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
There's like two little peas.

274
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Even on this dead vine, you can still find like the final little bits.

275
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I don't think I'd eat those.

276
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
They don't look very good.

277
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
But still.

278
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Like, um, mines away.

279
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
So this is the final dregs of the lettuce.

280
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
As you can see.

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
They don't look good.

282
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
They've gone to seed.

283
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Once it starts producing seeds, the lettuce gets more bitter.

284
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I don't mind it.

285
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Naomi doesn't complain, but it's still edible.

286
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
So we'll chop all these down.

287
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Or Naomi will anyway.

288
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
And then we'll pick out all of the, uh, all the leaves.

289
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Let me go to the kitchen.

290
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
And that'll be dinner tonight.

291
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Along with this chard.

292
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
You know what those late chards that we bought?

293
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
They worked out too.

294
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Oh yeah.

295
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Cucumbers just didn't work.

296
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
I don't know why.

297
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,440
You can see in there, there's like two tiny ones and that's all we got.

298
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
I don't even know if there's three.

299
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I don't even know if those are edible, but I'll get them just in case.

300
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Maybe we'll let Dave be the guinea pig.

301
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,440
We'll just not tell him that they're dead.

302
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
There we go.

303
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Like it's, the vine's already dead.

304
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
The vine's already dead.

305
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
There's a cucumber.

306
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Jesus.

307
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,440
So there's five, five malformed cucumbers.

308
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Hold up that teeny tiny round one.

309
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
It looks like an avocado.

310
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
So this is probably going to be the final haul from the garden.

311
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Kind of disappointing.

312
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,440
We still got something, but it's not what I expected.

313
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Here's our lettuce and our chard.

314
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,440
We've got our deformed cucumbers, three bowls of tomatoes and two final bags of kale.

315
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Not Naomi's glasses.

316
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
We harvested Naomi's glasses.

317
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
No, no, no.

318
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
You lost them in the garden.

319
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Eons ago.

320
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
No, I'm fixing those with the power of Flex Seal.

321
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Not a paid promotion.

322
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
That looks pretty good, baby.

323
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Give me all those plants.

324
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Be careful balancing those, Naomi.

325
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
There's only so much room in the windowsill.

326
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
I got this.

327
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
It's fine.

328
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Hey, look, this one is like, I know it's not, it's just really fat.

329
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,440
It almost looks like there was another one trying to grow.

330
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,440
It's going to fall.

331
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
No, no.

332
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Look at that.

333
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
No, no.

334
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Put it somewhere else.

335
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Fine.

336
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
We have more than one windowsill in the house.

337
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Nope.

338
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I'm going to fit them all here.

339
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
All right.

340
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,440
So let's try out one of these deformed cucumbers here.

341
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
I mean, it's pretty seedy in there.

342
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Maybe it's okay.

343
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Seeds taste good.

344
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Yum.

345
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
All right.

346
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
All right.

347
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
I don't know how I feel about this.

348
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,440
It's like not any more bad than a regular grocery store cucumber.

349
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Yeah, I guess.

350
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
It's probably still fine.

351
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
It's just a cucumber.

352
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh, it's very mushy inside.

353
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
That's all very mushy.

354
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
But this stuff is still good.

355
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
And here we are, the third week of September.

356
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Naomi is grabbing the stuff.

357
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
And we did basically what we did last year.

358
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
We knew that frost was coming,

359
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
so we just let the garden be to do whatever it wanted to do.

360
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
We didn't water it anymore.

361
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
We didn't do anything to it.

362
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
And we're going to get the final dregs,

363
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
and then we're going to pull it out,

364
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,440
because I want to do something to this garden

365
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,440
after you pull everything out that will prevent this disaster

366
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
from happening again.

367
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Naomi's very tired.

368
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
We've got a couple more chard leaves.

369
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
The kale, I bet the kale could just grow in winter.

370
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
There's so much.

371
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
It just grows in the snow.

372
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
We'll grab the last few peppers,

373
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
and we'll grab the last few tomatoes,

374
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
and then we're going to just yank everything out.

375
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
How do you unlock this?

376
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
You have to, like, pull this down here.

377
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
I tried.

378
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
There it goes.

379
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Oh, thank you.

380
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I just noticed my disaster plant actually managed to come back.

381
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Hooray.

382
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
We can definitely garden better than Chaz.

383
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Yeah.

384
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Naomi just grabbed the last pepper,

385
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,440
and I just realized of these six pepper plants,

386
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
we got, like, four peppers.

387
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
There's a baby one right here.

388
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
There's, like, a baby one right there, too, right behind you.

389
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Like a baby baby?

390
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Yeah, like a tiny little pepper.

391
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
And there it is, the final two bowls of dregs

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
at the end of the garden this year.

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
It's starting to get cold.

394
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I think it's going to rain.

395
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Yeah, it's supposed to rain this afternoon.

396
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Basically, we're doing this right now

397
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
because, like, we had a little bit of minor frost,

398
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,440
but today's rain is going to be the actual beginning of fall

399
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
when the Canadian winter blows in

400
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
and just covers the entire landscape in a giant sheet of ice,

401
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
and we're basically racing against time

402
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
before the rain at 2 o'clock.

403
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
It doesn't happen till late October.

404
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
No, I think we're going to be basically frozen

405
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
inside of our house for the next five months.

406
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
You think so, eh?

407
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
We're going to do something a bit special this year

408
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
as Naomi clears out the garden.

409
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm going to do it, too.

410
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,440
So first, we've got to get all this stuff out of here.

411
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Come on.

412
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
It's hard to do this one-handed.

413
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Come on.

414
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Ah.

415
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
The tomato cage, we'll store these away

416
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
until next year.

417
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
And there's the tomato plant.

418
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Oh, it's still in.

419
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
And there you go.

420
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
All the plants are off.

421
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Here's a big pile of plants.

422
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Naomi, you think that there's a clover infestation

423
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
in the garden at this point, right?

424
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Probably.

425
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Can't see it anymore.

426
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
So we're going to rake off the top layer,

427
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,440
shove it into the compost, and hopefully that'll be okay.

428
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,440
What I wanted to do is to get some excess.

429
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Open up again. Come on.

430
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Why is this always giving me a hard time?

431
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,440
I'm going to grab that excess compost as well

432
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
and shove it in the garden after we've raked it off.

433
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Hopefully, we can use it to rejuvenate the garden, maybe.

434
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
So here's all the weeds and plants and junk,

435
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
and I'll just grab it.

436
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
That's a lot of it.

437
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
And it's going to go in.

438
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
It's going to sit in the compost.

439
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
It's going to...

440
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Grrr!

441
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I'll just gigachat it.

442
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,440
It's real hard to rake one-handed.

443
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Also, why am I using a leaf rake?

444
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Okay, so there's a pile of the top layer

445
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,440
with all the clover bits in it,

446
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,440
and I'll just shovel it into the compost.

447
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,440
And hopefully, one year going through the composter

448
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
will make that soil okay again.

449
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Top layer's been shoveled off?

450
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Mostly.

451
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
There it is. It's all in there.

452
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Now I think the plan is,

453
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
since we are missing a bunch of earth at this point,

454
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm going to shovel out all that compost,

455
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
like I mentioned, right there.

456
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
We can get the lettuce bed,

457
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
and also there's a bag of manure.

458
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
You okay in there?

459
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
There it is.

460
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
I'm going to assume you can't dump it in?

461
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Probably not.

462
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Alright, I'll just dump it in, and Naomi can layer it around.

463
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Jesus.

464
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
It's actually not that heavy when it's two-handed,

465
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
but I've got to hold the phone.

466
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Come on.

467
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,440
An extra bag of manure right into the garden,

468
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
just to rejuvenate it over the winter.

469
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Same with this thing.

470
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Yep, there it goes.

471
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Oh my god, look at all the roots at the bottom.

472
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
I didn't know that there'd be that many roots.

473
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Of course there'd be a shit ton of roots.

474
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
We just put the land in it.

475
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Oops.

476
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
It's compost time.

477
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Look at all those eggs.

478
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Eggshells are apparently pretty good for a garden.

479
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Also, we eat a lot of eggs.

480
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
There we go.

481
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Compost on my side, manure on Naomi's.

482
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,440
All the compost is gone, so we'll close this up.

483
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Come on.

484
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,440
And then we'll mash all this stuff down to make room.

485
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Oh god, this is going to take a while.

486
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Wee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

487
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Making a compostable, which is brutal.

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Wee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

489
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Yeah.

490
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
A beautiful-looking garden ready for next year.

491
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Once the leaves really start coming down,

492
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,440
I'll cover this thing with leaves in October or so.

493
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
But we did a good job.

494
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
There's Naomi holding the rake.

495
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Hey, do you want to like, because I'm holding the shovel,

496
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
do you want to like, recreate that picture of like,

497
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
those two farmers who are like, really sour looking?

498
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
They're like, holding their tools.

499
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
We'll see you next time.

500
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
We'll see you next year, hopefully.

501
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Unless the garden fails again.

502
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,440
At which point, I just won't even upload it.

503
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Well, if it fails again, why wouldn't you upload at least one video being like,

504
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
a failed goodbye?

505
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Next year-

506
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
No more political videos.

507
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Next year's video is just the garden on fire.

508
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:08,440
Thanks for watching.
