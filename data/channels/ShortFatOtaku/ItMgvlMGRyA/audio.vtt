WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
Okay, guys, it is time for the next harvest.

00:09.320 --> 00:13.320
This is the first week of July, the lettuce still isn't ready, but everything else is

00:13.320 --> 00:14.320
definitely good.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.520
I'll be getting kale and peas for tonight's salad.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.520
Look at those peas.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.960
Wait a second.

00:22.960 --> 00:23.960
Naomi?

00:23.960 --> 00:24.960
Yeah?

00:24.960 --> 00:25.960
Can you throw down a bowl?

00:25.960 --> 00:26.960
Damn it, Dad.

00:26.960 --> 00:27.960
Ow!

00:27.960 --> 00:32.840
God damn it.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.080
Let's see if these peas can be pulled off.

00:36.080 --> 00:40.400
Kinda, but kinda not.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.520
I don't want to pull too hard.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.520
You know what?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.520
I guess I'll have to snip them.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.360
Yeah, they're looking good.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.000
And now for the kale trim.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.540
Well, the bowl was a bit too small, but that's okay.

00:55.540 --> 00:59.500
It is incredibly stormy out here right now.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.820
The new deck set is getting drenched.

01:02.820 --> 01:08.420
It's an extremely warm rain, though, and that's nice.

01:08.420 --> 01:10.700
Good for the garden, too.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.540
So where's all that water coming from?

01:14.540 --> 01:19.460
Oh, Jesus.

01:19.460 --> 01:20.860
That doesn't look very good.

01:20.860 --> 01:23.700
Maybe I gotta fix that.

01:24.020 --> 01:28.580
Oh my lord, this has been my entire summer.

01:28.580 --> 01:32.260
Nothing but monsoon season, dude.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.740
I don't know if you can see it down there, but the garden is flooding.

01:35.740 --> 01:38.900
I still haven't fixed that, either.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.420
It's blowing into the house.

01:40.420 --> 01:41.460
Here we are.

01:41.460 --> 01:45.100
It's nearing the end of July at this point, and this is how the garden looks.

01:45.100 --> 01:50.380
There's Naomi doing some weeding, and there's actually a lot of weeding to do.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.900
A combination of things prevented us from harvesting earlier.

01:53.900 --> 02:00.100
There's a lot of kale, there's a lot of chard, there's a lot of lettuce, and a fair number

02:00.100 --> 02:01.100
of peas.

02:01.100 --> 02:03.740
However, I am noticing some problems with the current garden.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.300
That was full of weeds.

02:05.300 --> 02:10.580
Maybe it's weeds, but also, like, the cucumbers should have taken off by now, and they haven't.

02:10.580 --> 02:11.900
There's not many tomatoes coming in.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.580
I see, like, one tomato in there.

02:13.580 --> 02:14.580
They're still flowering, bro.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.620
They're still flowering, but, like, they're not really going the way that they were last

02:17.620 --> 02:18.620
year.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.700
The kale's doing well, and the kale's doing well.

02:20.700 --> 02:25.500
However, also, I think the peppers should have started up earlier, too.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.820
Maybe it's because of how wet it's been this summer?

02:28.820 --> 02:31.220
Maybe it's because of how hot it's been this summer?

02:31.220 --> 02:32.220
Who knows?

02:32.220 --> 02:33.620
Hot and wet, and sometimes cold.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.620
Wet, hot American summer.

02:34.620 --> 02:35.620
Meh.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.340
I have a feeling this might not be a great garden this year.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.340
Nope.

02:39.340 --> 02:40.620
But at the very least, tonight, we'll be able to-

02:40.620 --> 02:41.620
Can you move the lettuce?

02:41.620 --> 02:42.620
Wow, Naomi.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.620
Can you just move it?

02:43.620 --> 02:45.620
How many weeds have you thrown in there?

02:45.620 --> 02:46.620
None, actually.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.620
That was the first one.

02:47.620 --> 02:48.620
I'm sure.

02:48.620 --> 02:53.300
And I'll come back down tonight to collect peas for the salad.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.460
Right now, I've got to harvest all this kale, man.

02:55.460 --> 02:56.460
There's too much of it.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.460
And look at that.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.380
That's a lot of kale I've got to pick up now.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.340
How many bags will that be?

03:01.340 --> 03:02.340
Three or four?

03:02.340 --> 03:04.460
I accidentally threw it, and even though it was so far away.

03:04.460 --> 03:05.460
I moved it.

03:05.460 --> 03:06.460
Are you kidding me?

03:06.460 --> 03:07.460
I'm sorry.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.460
It was a gentle toss.

03:09.460 --> 03:10.460
Yeah?

03:10.460 --> 03:11.460
You know what?

03:11.460 --> 03:12.460
Don't-

03:12.460 --> 03:13.460
Deserved.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.460
What?

03:14.460 --> 03:15.460
Don't.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.460
That's good.

03:16.460 --> 03:17.460
That's good.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.460
That's good.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.460
There we go.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.700
Four bags of kale, ready to be frozen.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.420
I'm going to eat this out of the garden now.

03:25.420 --> 03:26.820
I'm going to help Naomi with the weeding.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.140
There she is.

03:28.140 --> 03:34.420
And you can see, there's a few small tomatoes coming in, but not really that many.

03:34.420 --> 03:41.700
Also, the cucumbers are growing very slowly, and the roots, not the roots, but the early

03:41.700 --> 03:42.980
part of the vine is very white.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.140
I don't know what's going on there.

03:45.140 --> 03:50.780
At the same time, it was like the same problems overtaking the peas, but at least they produced

03:50.780 --> 03:53.140
more peas, and they lasted longer this year, you know?

03:53.140 --> 03:54.780
There's one dead vine in there already.

03:54.780 --> 03:59.820
They didn't grow as tall as they did, but they are producing more peas, and that's nice.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.140
So I guess I'll look at all those weeds.

04:02.140 --> 04:03.140
I'll get to weeding then.

04:03.140 --> 04:05.140
Wait, Naomi, you're sitting on a plant?

04:05.140 --> 04:06.140
No.

04:06.140 --> 04:07.140
Just move your feed for a minute.

04:07.140 --> 04:08.140
I'm not.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.460
There's a really tiny plant that's barely alive in there.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.460
Wait, did you pull it out?

04:12.460 --> 04:13.460
No.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.460
There's no plant here.

04:14.780 --> 04:15.780
No, there actually is.

04:15.780 --> 04:16.780
Seriously.

04:16.780 --> 04:17.780
Okay.

04:17.780 --> 04:18.780
Oh, no.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.780
Yeah, it's right there.

04:20.780 --> 04:21.780
See?

04:21.780 --> 04:22.780
There it is.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.940
It's a really tiny kale trying to recover.

04:24.940 --> 04:26.980
There's a little bit of growth in there.

04:26.980 --> 04:27.980
See that?

04:27.980 --> 04:28.980
Don't step on the plants, Dev.

04:28.980 --> 04:29.980
I won't.

04:29.980 --> 04:30.980
I don't believe you.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.980
Is this the second kale plant that you've murdered, Naomi?

04:33.980 --> 04:34.980
Yes.

04:34.980 --> 04:39.820
I hate kale secretly, even though I eat it all the time, so I just murder kale plants

04:39.820 --> 04:41.620
because it brings joy to my life.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.620
I have a feeling that one's not coming back at this point, eh?

04:43.780 --> 04:44.780
Probably not.

04:44.780 --> 04:45.780
Oh, well.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.780
Okay, Naomi's going to get some water, and we're done.

04:47.780 --> 04:48.780
Don't fall.

04:48.780 --> 04:52.780
So, we're finished with weeding for the most part.

04:52.780 --> 04:54.780
It looks a lot better.

04:54.780 --> 04:56.780
We have all the kale.

04:56.780 --> 04:59.780
I pushed some of the vines towards going up the lattice.

04:59.780 --> 05:01.780
Hopefully, it'll be okay.

05:01.780 --> 05:03.780
I don't know about the garden this year.

05:03.780 --> 05:04.780
I don't know.

05:04.780 --> 05:05.780
It might not be so good.

05:05.780 --> 05:08.780
Maybe I put the tomatoes too close together.

05:08.780 --> 05:10.780
The peas always seem to die.

05:10.780 --> 05:12.780
I don't quite know why.

05:12.940 --> 05:16.540
She accidentally dug up a root of the peas while weeding, so she theorized that maybe

05:16.540 --> 05:22.280
what's going on with the peas is that we're not watering them deep enough so the roots

05:22.280 --> 05:23.980
aren't going deeply.

05:23.980 --> 05:28.380
Maybe that's the problem, but other things seem to be going very well.

05:28.380 --> 05:34.940
We'll grab some of the Swiss chard and the peas tonight and the lettuce for salads, and

05:34.940 --> 05:35.940
it'll be a-okay.

05:35.940 --> 05:37.940
Can you see that?

05:37.940 --> 05:39.860
That's a spider web in the garden.

05:39.940 --> 05:45.100
I have not been around much this summer, and the garden has become, well, it's gotten away

05:45.100 --> 05:47.100
from me a bit.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.100
Anyway, here's what's been going on.

05:50.100 --> 05:54.540
The lettuce is going crazy, but now the lettuce is bolting, and this is entirely my fault.

05:54.540 --> 06:00.200
I just haven't trimmed it, haven't been around, but hopefully, if I cut it down again, it

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
should be okay.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.260
It's time for another trim of the kale.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.220
It's definitely time to start eating the chard.

06:05.220 --> 06:09.820
There's a pepper coming in finally, and over there, see that red?

06:09.820 --> 06:10.820
There's a tomato.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.260
The cucumbers aren't doing so well.

06:12.260 --> 06:14.660
There's one cucumber there, but generally the vines aren't going.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.180
I don't know what happened this year.

06:16.180 --> 06:20.700
There's still peas, and they're still growing, but they didn't really take off the way that

06:20.700 --> 06:21.700
they did in previous years.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.100
At least they got a lot of peas out of them though, so that's okay.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.320
They actually lasted longer than previous years, which is surprising.

06:27.320 --> 06:33.980
The garden overall is not doing nearly as well, hi Naomi, is not doing nearly as well

06:33.980 --> 06:35.220
as previous years.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.960
I don't quite know why.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.740
The kale and the lettuce are the things that really, really worked out.

06:40.740 --> 06:44.760
Everything else is kind of working out, but it's still worse than last year.

06:44.760 --> 06:49.560
Also, look, that tiny kale is slowly coming back.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.640
This time, I just brought a giant pot because there's too much to harvest.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.240
Jesus, it's filled the whole pot.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.240
Same thing with the chard.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.960
I haven't trimmed one of these on camera before, so I think you just get in there, snip the

07:07.960 --> 07:14.240
stalk, get a bunch of chard leaves.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.240
That's a big leaf.

07:15.240 --> 07:24.480
All right, well, I guess I'll just trim again like so and hope that it won't keep making

07:24.480 --> 07:25.480
seeds.

07:25.480 --> 07:31.120
You basically just cut it like grass if you're cutting your lawn with scissors.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.000
These are all cut.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.560
Let's hope they continue to grow back.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.020
Maybe so I can pick off some of these lower leaves too.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.020
These guys here.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.020
Yeah.

07:41.020 --> 07:44.040
That was a few blades of grass in there.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.560
That's okay, we'll figure it out.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.560
There it is.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.960
Just a big pot of leaves.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.240
Naomi, look at this.

07:51.240 --> 07:56.320
That's a weird looking stew, Dev.

07:56.320 --> 08:00.000
It's the first week of September, we're coming up to the end of the garden and it is not

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
looking good.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.840
Peas always die around this time of year.

08:02.840 --> 08:03.840
That's fine.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.840
Expected.

08:04.840 --> 08:05.840
We got our share of peas out of them.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.120
The lettuce was a success for the most part.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.760
The two chard plants worked out.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.160
The kale, as always, was amazing.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
We've got to cut it again.

08:11.160 --> 08:16.400
We only got a few decently big peppers out of them this time, like this one, for example.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.940
That one didn't take off at all.

08:17.940 --> 08:22.560
The cucumbers just never grew and there's like one little tiny cucumber there.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.480
I don't know what happened.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
The tomatoes have been hit and miss.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.840
Firstly, whenever there's a red one, not so much this time, but for the most part, whenever

08:30.840 --> 08:32.720
there's a red one, an animal goes to eat it.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.880
That one's been eaten by an animal, probably like a chipmunk or something.

08:35.880 --> 08:40.120
Secondly, this small one fell on the ground, so I took it off, hoping it would ripen up.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.200
But instead of ripen up, it just rotted from the inside.

08:42.200 --> 08:47.700
If I pull off all those green tomatoes and if they don't rot, like this one did, we might

08:47.700 --> 08:49.580
get half what we got last year.

08:49.580 --> 08:53.560
We are in the second week of September.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.600
Naomi's gathering up the kale right now.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
You missed her feet.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.360
She was changing her shoes.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.760
You missed the Naomi feet pics.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.100
Cut your toes off, Dev.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.320
We have frost coming, so it's time to pull off whatever we can pull off.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.000
This sucks because like, it's coming this week.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.600
It's coming with all the rain.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.840
I guess the garden just didn't work out this year, guys.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.400
I'm not happy about it, but.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.400
Kale did.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.720
I guess if you live in Northern Ontario, there's gross shit tons of kale.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.720
Yeah.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.720
Kale always works out.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.040
Dude, even that, that one that I stomped on like made a slight comeback.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.040
Yeah.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.040
You can get like four leaves out of that.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.040
Yeah.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.440
Got the, uh, the old snippers.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.840
These are pretty dull at this point, but they're also like seven years old.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.840
Yeah.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.840
Yeah, I need one of those Pokemon bowls.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.840
Pokemon.

09:35.840 --> 09:36.840
Pokemon.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.840
I'll just, uh.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.440
In this case, that means produce.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.440
Produce?

09:43.440 --> 09:44.440
We're catching produce?

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
Yeah.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
Look at this.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.440
This tomato got so fat, it bent the vine.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.440
Nice.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.440
Give us the big fat tomato.

09:50.440 --> 09:53.440
There's actually a lot of tomatoes on here that is all green.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.440
Yeah.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.440
Except for that one over there.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.440
Or a red one.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.440
Or a red one.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.440
Like we did get a bunch.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.440
This is way less than normal, but we still got a bunch of tomatoes.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.440
So, like it's not a complete loss.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.440
I just grabbed the only two peppers.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.440
Naomi's here sniffing away.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.440
And this is what I mentioned last week.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.440
Some of them just rotted.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.440
Some animals ate them.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.440
Like, but there's still a bunch that are like okay.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.440
I think we'll be fine.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.440
Yeah, like there's a lot of hidden ones.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.440
Like right here.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.440
Yeah.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.440
See, look at all those.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.440
Yeah.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.440
They're green, but they're big.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.440
I just noticed this.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.440
You see that?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.440
There's like two little peas.

10:28.440 --> 10:34.440
Even on this dead vine, you can still find like the final little bits.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.440
I don't think I'd eat those.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.440
They don't look very good.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.440
But still.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.440
Like, um, mines away.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.440
So this is the final dregs of the lettuce.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.440
As you can see.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.440
They don't look good.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.440
They've gone to seed.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.440
Once it starts producing seeds, the lettuce gets more bitter.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.440
I don't mind it.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.440
Naomi doesn't complain, but it's still edible.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.440
So we'll chop all these down.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.440
Or Naomi will anyway.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.440
And then we'll pick out all of the, uh, all the leaves.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.440
Let me go to the kitchen.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.440
And that'll be dinner tonight.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.440
Along with this chard.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.440
You know what those late chards that we bought?

11:03.440 --> 11:04.440
They worked out too.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.440
Oh yeah.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.440
Cucumbers just didn't work.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.440
I don't know why.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.440
You can see in there, there's like two tiny ones and that's all we got.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.440
I don't even know if there's three.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.440
I don't even know if those are edible, but I'll get them just in case.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.440
Maybe we'll let Dave be the guinea pig.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.440
We'll just not tell him that they're dead.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.440
There we go.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
Like it's, the vine's already dead.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.440
The vine's already dead.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.440
There's a cucumber.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.440
Jesus.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.440
So there's five, five malformed cucumbers.

11:29.440 --> 11:36.440
Hold up that teeny tiny round one.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.440
It looks like an avocado.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.440
So this is probably going to be the final haul from the garden.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.440
Kind of disappointing.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.440
We still got something, but it's not what I expected.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.440
Here's our lettuce and our chard.

11:46.440 --> 11:52.440
We've got our deformed cucumbers, three bowls of tomatoes and two final bags of kale.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.440
Not Naomi's glasses.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.440
We harvested Naomi's glasses.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.440
No, no, no.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.440
You lost them in the garden.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.440
Eons ago.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.440
No, I'm fixing those with the power of Flex Seal.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.440
Not a paid promotion.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.440
That looks pretty good, baby.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.440
Give me all those plants.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.440
Be careful balancing those, Naomi.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.440
There's only so much room in the windowsill.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.440
I got this.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.440
It's fine.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.440
Hey, look, this one is like, I know it's not, it's just really fat.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.440
It almost looks like there was another one trying to grow.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.440
It's going to fall.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.440
No, no.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.440
Look at that.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.440
No, no.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.440
Put it somewhere else.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.440
Fine.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.440
We have more than one windowsill in the house.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.440
Nope.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.440
I'm going to fit them all here.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.440
All right.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.440
So let's try out one of these deformed cucumbers here.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.440
I mean, it's pretty seedy in there.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.440
Maybe it's okay.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.440
Seeds taste good.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.440
Yum.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.440
All right.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.440
All right.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.440
I don't know how I feel about this.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.440
It's like not any more bad than a regular grocery store cucumber.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.440
Yeah, I guess.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.440
It's probably still fine.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.440
It's just a cucumber.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.440
Oh, it's very mushy inside.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.440
That's all very mushy.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.440
But this stuff is still good.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.440
And here we are, the third week of September.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.440
Naomi is grabbing the stuff.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.440
And we did basically what we did last year.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.440
We knew that frost was coming,

13:15.440 --> 13:19.440
so we just let the garden be to do whatever it wanted to do.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
We didn't water it anymore.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
We didn't do anything to it.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.440
And we're going to get the final dregs,

13:23.440 --> 13:25.440
and then we're going to pull it out,

13:25.440 --> 13:28.440
because I want to do something to this garden

13:28.440 --> 13:31.440
after you pull everything out that will prevent this disaster

13:31.440 --> 13:32.440
from happening again.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.440
Naomi's very tired.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.440
We've got a couple more chard leaves.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.440
The kale, I bet the kale could just grow in winter.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.440
There's so much.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.440
It just grows in the snow.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.440
We'll grab the last few peppers,

13:45.440 --> 13:47.440
and we'll grab the last few tomatoes,

13:47.440 --> 13:51.440
and then we're going to just yank everything out.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.440
How do you unlock this?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.440
You have to, like, pull this down here.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.440
I tried.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.440
There it goes.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.440
Oh, thank you.

13:57.440 --> 14:02.440
I just noticed my disaster plant actually managed to come back.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.440
Hooray.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.440
We can definitely garden better than Chaz.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
Yeah.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.440
Naomi just grabbed the last pepper,

14:08.440 --> 14:11.440
and I just realized of these six pepper plants,

14:11.440 --> 14:13.440
we got, like, four peppers.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.440
There's a baby one right here.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.440
There's, like, a baby one right there, too, right behind you.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.440
Like a baby baby?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.440
Yeah, like a tiny little pepper.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.440
And there it is, the final two bowls of dregs

14:23.440 --> 14:25.440
at the end of the garden this year.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.440
It's starting to get cold.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.440
I think it's going to rain.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.440
Yeah, it's supposed to rain this afternoon.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.440
Basically, we're doing this right now

14:31.440 --> 14:33.440
because, like, we had a little bit of minor frost,

14:33.440 --> 14:38.440
but today's rain is going to be the actual beginning of fall

14:38.440 --> 14:41.440
when the Canadian winter blows in

14:41.440 --> 14:45.440
and just covers the entire landscape in a giant sheet of ice,

14:45.440 --> 14:47.440
and we're basically racing against time

14:47.440 --> 14:49.440
before the rain at 2 o'clock.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
It doesn't happen till late October.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.440
No, I think we're going to be basically frozen

14:53.440 --> 14:55.440
inside of our house for the next five months.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.440
You think so, eh?

14:56.440 --> 14:58.440
We're going to do something a bit special this year

14:58.440 --> 14:59.440
as Naomi clears out the garden.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.440
I'm going to do it, too.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.440
So first, we've got to get all this stuff out of here.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.440
Come on.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.440
It's hard to do this one-handed.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.440
Come on.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
Ah.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.440
The tomato cage, we'll store these away

15:10.440 --> 15:12.440
until next year.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.440
And there's the tomato plant.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
Oh, it's still in.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.440
And there you go.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.440
All the plants are off.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
Here's a big pile of plants.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.440
Naomi, you think that there's a clover infestation

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
in the garden at this point, right?

15:25.440 --> 15:26.440
Probably.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.440
Can't see it anymore.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.440
So we're going to rake off the top layer,

15:30.440 --> 15:33.440
shove it into the compost, and hopefully that'll be okay.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.440
What I wanted to do is to get some excess.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.440
Open up again. Come on.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.440
Why is this always giving me a hard time?

15:39.440 --> 15:42.440
I'm going to grab that excess compost as well

15:42.440 --> 15:45.440
and shove it in the garden after we've raked it off.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.440
Hopefully, we can use it to rejuvenate the garden, maybe.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.440
So here's all the weeds and plants and junk,

15:50.440 --> 15:53.440
and I'll just grab it.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.440
That's a lot of it.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.440
And it's going to go in.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.440
It's going to sit in the compost.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.440
It's going to...

15:59.440 --> 16:01.440
Grrr!

16:01.440 --> 16:03.440
I'll just gigachat it.

16:03.440 --> 16:09.440
It's real hard to rake one-handed.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.440
Also, why am I using a leaf rake?

16:11.440 --> 16:14.440
Okay, so there's a pile of the top layer

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
with all the clover bits in it,

16:17.440 --> 16:22.440
and I'll just shovel it into the compost.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.440
And hopefully, one year going through the composter

16:26.440 --> 16:28.440
will make that soil okay again.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.440
Top layer's been shoveled off?

16:30.440 --> 16:31.440
Mostly.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.440
There it is. It's all in there.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.440
Now I think the plan is,

16:34.440 --> 16:36.440
since we are missing a bunch of earth at this point,

16:36.440 --> 16:38.440
I'm going to shovel out all that compost,

16:38.440 --> 16:39.440
like I mentioned, right there.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.440
We can get the lettuce bed,

16:41.440 --> 16:45.440
and also there's a bag of manure.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.440
You okay in there?

16:51.440 --> 16:53.440
There it is.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.440
I'm going to assume you can't dump it in?

16:55.440 --> 16:57.440
Probably not.

16:57.440 --> 17:03.440
Alright, I'll just dump it in, and Naomi can layer it around.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.440
Jesus.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.440
It's actually not that heavy when it's two-handed,

17:07.440 --> 17:09.440
but I've got to hold the phone.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.440
Come on.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.440
An extra bag of manure right into the garden,

17:14.440 --> 17:16.440
just to rejuvenate it over the winter.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
Same with this thing.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.440
Yep, there it goes.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.440
Oh my god, look at all the roots at the bottom.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.440
I didn't know that there'd be that many roots.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.440
Of course there'd be a shit ton of roots.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.440
We just put the land in it.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.440
Oops.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.440
It's compost time.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.440
Look at all those eggs.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.440
Eggshells are apparently pretty good for a garden.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
Also, we eat a lot of eggs.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.440
There we go.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.440
Compost on my side, manure on Naomi's.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.440
All the compost is gone, so we'll close this up.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.440
Come on.

17:50.440 --> 17:55.440
And then we'll mash all this stuff down to make room.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.440
Oh god, this is going to take a while.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.440
Wee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.440
Making a compostable, which is brutal.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.440
Wee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

18:06.440 --> 18:07.440
Yeah.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.440
A beautiful-looking garden ready for next year.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.440
Once the leaves really start coming down,

18:11.440 --> 18:17.440
I'll cover this thing with leaves in October or so.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.440
But we did a good job.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.440
There's Naomi holding the rake.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.440
Hey, do you want to like, because I'm holding the shovel,

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
do you want to like, recreate that picture of like,

18:25.440 --> 18:27.440
those two farmers who are like, really sour looking?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.440
They're like, holding their tools.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.440
We'll see you next time.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.440
We'll see you next year, hopefully.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.440
Unless the garden fails again.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.440
At which point, I just won't even upload it.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.440
Well, if it fails again, why wouldn't you upload at least one video being like,

18:39.440 --> 18:41.440
a failed goodbye?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.440
Next year-

18:42.440 --> 18:43.440
No more political videos.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.440
Next year's video is just the garden on fire.

18:53.440 --> 19:08.440
Thanks for watching.
