0	8780	It's time to check back in on our old pal, Sam Brinton.
8780	12860	In case you don't know who that is, watch my old video from about 9 months ago.
12860	16500	Pause this one and go check it out, because context is actually pretty important.
16500	21380	Though Sam is kind of a weird person, the previous video wasn't in my Dissecting a
21380	25100	Degenerate series, because Sam is ultimately a tragic figure.
25100	30120	The TLDR of the Sam Brinton story is, as a young boy, he felt an attraction to other
30120	35000	boys his age, prompting his parents to put him through what he described as a viciously
35000	37520	torturous conversion therapy program.
37520	42360	As an adult, Sam became an expert in nuclear waste disposal, pioneered innovations in that
42360	47880	field, and made headlines at the beginning of 2022 for being the first openly non-binary
47880	51800	person to ever sit in a public-facing job in the Department of Energy.
51800	59200	He went from a he-him gay male in his youth and early 20s to a they-them non-binary person
59200	60200	in their 30s.
60200	64760	It's hard to know how much of Sam's gender presentation, the kinks, which went viral,
64760	69840	and the extremely flamboyant personality is actually them, and how much of it is an extreme
69840	72920	reaction to the horrific conditions they endured as a child.
72920	77640	Listening to Sam speak about his experiences back in 2011, he's literally just a normal
77640	78640	guy.
78640	82880	He's got a bit of that stereotypical gay lisp that was a big joke in the 2000s.
82880	86060	But if this person hadn't been tortured as a child, maybe they would have just ended
86060	91120	up as a regular gay adult, and not be constantly going more over-the-top in a mad scramble
91120	93440	for love, acceptance, and attention.
93440	98320	Well, Sam is back in the spotlight for a news story I covered in the Weekly Sip a few weeks
98320	99320	back.
99320	103040	US Nuclear Official Charged With Stealing Suitcase From Airport
103040	107460	US nuclear official Sam Brinton is facing accusations that they stole a suitcase at
107460	109620	an airport in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
109620	113620	Court documents reveal that the 35-year-old, who was appointed this year as the head of
113620	118840	spent nuclear fuel management at the Department of Energy, allegedly stole a bag from a carousel
118840	123340	at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, leading to Brinton being charged with felony
123340	124340	theft.
124340	128140	Security footage showed Brinton removing the bag's tag and putting the bag tag in the
128140	131580	handbag they were carrying, and then leaving the area at a quick pace.
131580	135020	Brinton told law enforcement officials that if I had taken the wrong bag I'm happy to
135020	137560	return it, but I don't have any clothes for another individual.
137560	139680	That was my clothes when I opened the bag.
139680	143900	Brinton got in touch with airport staff later to say that they hadn't been completely
143900	146340	honest and admitted to taking the blue bag.
146340	150060	They said they were tired and took the suitcase thinking it was theirs.
150060	153700	Brinton grew nervous after opening the bag as they realized it wasn't theirs.
153700	157120	They said they became nervous because people would think they stole the bag and didn't
157120	158120	know what to do.
158120	160040	Okay, so this sounds like an honest mistake, right?
160040	161360	Sam steals the woman's bag.
161360	163380	If you're in a rush, no one's going to check what's in it right away.
163380	166060	Back in the hotel room, it's filled with women's clothing suddenly.
166060	168900	And that isn't a red flag for Sam, considering.
168900	170500	Everything seems reasonable here.
170500	175000	Except of course, that security footage showing Sam removing the baggage tag and then taking
175000	176420	off at a quick pace.
176420	179780	And the fact that Sam appears to have stolen the woman's clothing.
179780	183780	Brinton said they left the clothes from the bag in a drawer at the Intercontinental St.
183780	187940	Paul Riverfront Hotel, but no clothing was recovered from the hotel room, said the cops.
187940	188940	That's a big oof.
188940	192980	And a lot of us who heard this story on social media thought it was just going to be a one-time
192980	193980	thing.
193980	198320	But it turns out Sam might actually be a serial woman's clothing thief.
198320	203860	Non-binary Biden nuclear official Sam Brinton accused in a second luggage heist.
203860	208380	A Biden administration Energy Department official who allegedly stole a woman's suitcase from
208380	212620	a Minneapolis airport in September has been accused of another luggage heist at a Las
212620	213940	Vegas airport.
213940	218540	A felony warrant on grand larceny charges was issued on Thursday.
218540	221740	And yes, this has led to Sam Brinton losing his job.
221740	226460	Initially, after that first case hit the news cycle, Sam was placed on temporary leave
226460	228020	by the Department of Energy.
228020	232820	But now that we know it's not a one-off thing, non-binary Biden nuclear official Sam
232820	236260	Brinton fired after multiple luggage theft charges.
236260	240500	The Department of Energy has confirmed that Sam has been let go, but due to confidentiality,
240500	242660	can't comment on the case further.
242660	248180	Sam faces a possible $10,000 fine and up to five years in jail for the Minnesota theft
248180	250520	and another 10 for the Las Vegas one.
250520	254780	Both suitcases were stuffed full of women's clothing, makeup, and jewelry judged to be
254780	260520	worth several thousand dollars per suitcase, and Sam was seen publicly using those stolen
260520	263440	suitcases during their subsequent travels.
263440	267140	Sam appeared in a Las Vegas courtroom on Wednesday, December 14.
267140	271540	This mega-mind-looking mugshot made the rounds on social media, which finally clued in the
271540	275240	normies to what's going on and made him remember the previous news stories.
275240	278800	In fact, social media seems to be part of Sam's downfall.
278800	283280	They did an informal promotion for American Nuclear, wearing one of their pride-themed
283280	287880	t-shirts on their social media, specifically saying that the shirt was a great shirt for
287880	289680	me to wear on my flight today.
289680	293560	My professional society continues to grow and learn and I'm proud of them.
293560	297320	Goodness, how we have changed since my service as a chapter president.
297320	302440	And it's the exact same shirt that Sam was wearing while caught on surveillance cameras
302440	303980	stealing the luggage.
303980	309140	Sam made a $15,000 bail and is due back in court in Minneapolis this time on December
309140	310140	19.
310140	311140	That's today.
311140	314920	And yes, I'm recording this video before any new news comes out from that trial.
314920	319020	I highly doubt anything crazy is going to happen, a lot of this stuff is just procedural
319020	320140	at this point.
320140	324580	Sam asked through an attorney to appear virtually at the Minneapolis court on account of currently
324580	329900	dealing with the Las Vegas trial and traveling being a financial strain while unemployed.
329900	334700	According to some articles, this claim of financial strain might be a hoax, as there's
334700	340340	some reports of Sam's Instagram showing attendance at Boston and New York choral performances,
340340	345100	documentary premieres, and Broadway shows during this apparent tough financial time.
345100	349660	But that is something that I can't confirm, as Sam's Instagram is now private and I
349660	353260	can't find any screencaps, just the words of the journalists who claim to have seen
353260	354260	it.
354260	358300	Here's the thing, a lot of people had hunches that Sam was doing something weird, including
358300	359300	me.
359700	364220	None of Sam's sexual activities, the public embracing of kink, the genderfluid stuff,
364220	369820	the LGBT activism, hell, even their legitimately tragic past, none of it is a disqualifier
369820	371340	for public service.
371340	375860	Nor does it render all of their academic and professional experience in nuclear waste that
375860	378700	Sam legitimately has under their belt irrelevant.
378700	382700	Making fun of Sam for the weird viral pics is one thing, it's the internet, we're
382700	384020	having a laugh, it's whatever.
384020	388660	But there was never any evidence that what Sam did off the clock affected their work
389020	390020	at the Department of Energy.
390020	393140	And so, memes aside, it's actually not an issue.
393140	397100	But there's this sense of, it's not about what you show proudly, but what you hide.
397100	399160	And that's a dangerous thing to say, I know.
399160	402700	You can very easily fall down the, if you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing
402700	404460	to hide rabbit hole with that logic.
404460	405740	But I'm not going there.
405740	411100	The thesis of my last video on Sam Brenton was fundamentally on an appeal to good taste.
411100	415180	In my opinion, enjoy whatever type of sex you want in private, no matter how fucking
415180	416220	weird it is.
416220	417540	But you should keep it private.
417820	420900	There's no reason for the world to know what you enjoy in the bedroom, that's for
420900	422100	you and your partner.
422100	425700	And the ability to keep it private is a marker of somebody who has good taste.
425700	428140	Yes, adults have sex, they do it all the time.
428140	431500	And in adult relationships, sex is actually pretty normalized.
431500	435780	I know for like any teenagers listening, or maybe even any adult virgins who are listening,
435780	439700	you might think that sex is this magical thing, and sure, sometimes it can be.
439700	443820	But when you're in a long-term relationship and you're sexually active in that relationship,
443820	448340	the truth is, sex becomes one of those normal things that adults just do.
448340	454100	But all of that is not a reason to normalize your sex life outside of your relationship.
454100	459220	The fact that Sam Brenton was willing not only to make his sex life public, but to make
459220	463820	a career out of it, first as an activist, and then secondly for representation purposes
463820	467220	at the Department of Energy, was a massive red flag for me.
467220	472860	Also, that now-this clip from my previous video sits a lot more uneasily with me than
472900	473900	it did before.
473900	477900	Not that it was a totally normal thing before, but with the red flag now in mind, I'm starting
477900	479620	to see hints of other ones.
479620	482460	Like look at the language that Sam uses in this clip.
482460	484180	Pronouns are confusing.
484180	486820	I'm not going to say that they're not.
486820	493500	But if I can have the President of the United States use my gender-neutral pronouns, and
493500	502100	I can respectfully use theirs, then I think we're going to be in a world where everyone
502100	509540	can be respected, and everyone has the responsibility to be respectful.
509540	514380	If I can have the President of the United States use my gender-neutral pronouns, have,
514380	519220	like make them, not ask politely, engage in normal social behavior, give and take, but
519220	525260	demand it, there is an angle of power and subservience that LGBT activists pretend isn't
525260	526820	here, but it's totally here.
526820	529900	Sam Brinton, in this video, looks like a man in a dress.
529900	533300	And you can be a man in a dress all you want, that's cool with me, but at some, emperor
533300	535180	has no clothes level of shit.
535180	539660	To be a man in a dress, demand others not call you a man, and then squeal in victory
539660	541260	after they acquiesce to you.
541260	545600	This is just some good old-fashioned armchair psych from Dev, but I personally think Sam
545600	549760	gets off on this, and this is a part of their public normalization of kink, just like the
549760	551280	dog stuff was years ago.
551280	555560	He wasn't even getting paid for it, he wasn't in porn or anything, he made it public simply
555560	558960	as a component of normalizing alternative sexualities.
558960	562240	If it turns out that they also have a fetish for stealing women's clothing, which may
562240	565280	very well be the case, I would not be surprised in the least.
565280	570360	Not because they're gay or non-binary, or they're an LGBTQ activist, none of that,
570360	574880	but because Sam Brinton is a person of low moral character, and their behavior has been
574880	577200	hinting at that for years.
580200	582280	Here's an addendum that I'm making while editing.
582280	586040	You know how I said, oh don't worry, I know the second court case is happening right now.
586040	589520	It's fine, no new news will come out about Sam Brinton, we can do this today.
589520	592840	Well you know how it is over here, with me putting my foot in my mouth literally all
592840	593840	the time.
593840	597520	It turns out that Sam Brinton's horrific childhood tale, which I went over in detail
597520	600040	in the previous video, might be too good to be true.
600040	604800	The Florida conversion therapist that Sam cites in that 2011 interview is remarkably
604800	610000	hard to find now that more in-depth investigations have begun into their actions.
610000	615240	The torture that Sam described was commonly in use in conversion therapy in the 1950s,
615240	620800	but the time period when they would have attended conversion therapy was 1999-2001, and no known
620800	625880	conversion therapist in the United States used those exercises at that time.
625880	630440	Tests by investigators and reporters to ask Sam Brinton who was their conversion therapist
630440	635200	and which conversion therapy facility did they attend were met with refusals to answer.
635200	640060	One reporter with the Los Angeles Blade, an LGBTQ-themed newspaper, stated that Sam was
640060	646480	the only survivor of conversion therapy since 1998 who has refused to name and shame their
646480	647480	abusers.
647480	651200	Sam claims to not remember the name of their conversion therapist due to trauma, but in
651200	655240	other interviews they describe the clinic as being located in a strip mall in Orlando,
655240	656240	Florida.
656240	661320	That Blade reporter checked with an LGBT-affiliated expert on conversion therapy in the Orlando
661320	666160	region, who confirmed that there was no known conversion therapy office at any strip mall
666160	669080	in Florida from 1999-2001.
669080	673480	The reporter also contacted Sam's mother, who isn't exactly a neutral source of information
673480	676760	herself, let's remember, but she said that Sam never went to conversion therapy.
676760	678800	But he did go to a psychiatrist.
678800	683880	Sam's own testimony has changed as they became more high profile, more recently describing
683880	688240	a licensed psychotherapist who attempted to perform conversion therapy on the side
688240	690480	rather than an actual conversion therapist.
690480	695640	The reporter personally warned the National Center for Lesbian Rights that Brinton's
695640	701280	story must be verified before he is put forward as a public figure, but the NCLR simply said
701280	706200	we must believe all survivors and moved forward with their spotlighting of Sam Brinton.
706200	711120	It's my personal opinion that Sam Brinton presented this story to various LGBTQ activist
711120	715440	organizations like the NCLR and The Trevor Project in order to quickly gain status within
715440	720480	those institutions, and what is probably a lie has stuck with him as they moved out of
720480	723000	student activism and into a professional career.
723000	728640	Additionally, there's a whole other host of LGBT activists, organizations, and journalists
728640	733520	who have allowed this fraud to continue under the guise of believing all victims, something
733520	737000	that progressives tell me is just a slogan and never actually happens.
737000	742160	In 2011, talking to Queerty, an LGBT outlet, Sam Brinton said I don't want to be the poster
742160	744400	child for the anti-conversion movement.
744400	748580	Considering how much fame and influence Sam has reaped since then, this is probably the
748580	750520	most false thing they've ever said.
