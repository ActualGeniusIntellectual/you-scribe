1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,780
It's time to check back in on our old pal, Sam Brinton.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,860
In case you don't know who that is, watch my old video from about 9 months ago.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,500
Pause this one and go check it out, because context is actually pretty important.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,380
Though Sam is kind of a weird person, the previous video wasn't in my Dissecting a

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,100
Degenerate series, because Sam is ultimately a tragic figure.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,120
The TLDR of the Sam Brinton story is, as a young boy, he felt an attraction to other

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,000
boys his age, prompting his parents to put him through what he described as a viciously

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,520
torturous conversion therapy program.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,360
As an adult, Sam became an expert in nuclear waste disposal, pioneered innovations in that

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,880
field, and made headlines at the beginning of 2022 for being the first openly non-binary

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,800
person to ever sit in a public-facing job in the Department of Energy.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,200
He went from a he-him gay male in his youth and early 20s to a they-them non-binary person

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
in their 30s.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,760
It's hard to know how much of Sam's gender presentation, the kinks, which went viral,

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,840
and the extremely flamboyant personality is actually them, and how much of it is an extreme

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,920
reaction to the horrific conditions they endured as a child.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,640
Listening to Sam speak about his experiences back in 2011, he's literally just a normal

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
guy.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,880
He's got a bit of that stereotypical gay lisp that was a big joke in the 2000s.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,060
But if this person hadn't been tortured as a child, maybe they would have just ended

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,120
up as a regular gay adult, and not be constantly going more over-the-top in a mad scramble

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,440
for love, acceptance, and attention.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,320
Well, Sam is back in the spotlight for a news story I covered in the Weekly Sip a few weeks

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
back.

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,040
US Nuclear Official Charged With Stealing Suitcase From Airport

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,460
US nuclear official Sam Brinton is facing accusations that they stole a suitcase at

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,620
an airport in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,620
Court documents reveal that the 35-year-old, who was appointed this year as the head of

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,840
spent nuclear fuel management at the Department of Energy, allegedly stole a bag from a carousel

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,340
at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, leading to Brinton being charged with felony

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,340
theft.

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,140
Security footage showed Brinton removing the bag's tag and putting the bag tag in the

33
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,580
handbag they were carrying, and then leaving the area at a quick pace.

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,020
Brinton told law enforcement officials that if I had taken the wrong bag I'm happy to

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,560
return it, but I don't have any clothes for another individual.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,680
That was my clothes when I opened the bag.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,900
Brinton got in touch with airport staff later to say that they hadn't been completely

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,340
honest and admitted to taking the blue bag.

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,060
They said they were tired and took the suitcase thinking it was theirs.

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,700
Brinton grew nervous after opening the bag as they realized it wasn't theirs.

41
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,120
They said they became nervous because people would think they stole the bag and didn't

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
know what to do.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
Okay, so this sounds like an honest mistake, right?

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,360
Sam steals the woman's bag.

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,380
If you're in a rush, no one's going to check what's in it right away.

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,060
Back in the hotel room, it's filled with women's clothing suddenly.

47
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,900
And that isn't a red flag for Sam, considering.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,500
Everything seems reasonable here.

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,000
Except of course, that security footage showing Sam removing the baggage tag and then taking

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,420
off at a quick pace.

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,780
And the fact that Sam appears to have stolen the woman's clothing.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Brinton said they left the clothes from the bag in a drawer at the Intercontinental St.

53
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,940
Paul Riverfront Hotel, but no clothing was recovered from the hotel room, said the cops.

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
That's a big oof.

55
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,980
And a lot of us who heard this story on social media thought it was just going to be a one-time

56
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,980
thing.

57
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,320
But it turns out Sam might actually be a serial woman's clothing thief.

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,860
Non-binary Biden nuclear official Sam Brinton accused in a second luggage heist.

59
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,380
A Biden administration Energy Department official who allegedly stole a woman's suitcase from

60
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,620
a Minneapolis airport in September has been accused of another luggage heist at a Las

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,940
Vegas airport.

62
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,540
A felony warrant on grand larceny charges was issued on Thursday.

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,740
And yes, this has led to Sam Brinton losing his job.

64
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,460
Initially, after that first case hit the news cycle, Sam was placed on temporary leave

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,020
by the Department of Energy.

66
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,820
But now that we know it's not a one-off thing, non-binary Biden nuclear official Sam

67
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,260
Brinton fired after multiple luggage theft charges.

68
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,500
The Department of Energy has confirmed that Sam has been let go, but due to confidentiality,

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,660
can't comment on the case further.

70
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,180
Sam faces a possible $10,000 fine and up to five years in jail for the Minnesota theft

71
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,520
and another 10 for the Las Vegas one.

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,780
Both suitcases were stuffed full of women's clothing, makeup, and jewelry judged to be

73
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,520
worth several thousand dollars per suitcase, and Sam was seen publicly using those stolen

74
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,440
suitcases during their subsequent travels.

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,140
Sam appeared in a Las Vegas courtroom on Wednesday, December 14.

76
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,540
This mega-mind-looking mugshot made the rounds on social media, which finally clued in the

77
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,240
normies to what's going on and made him remember the previous news stories.

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,800
In fact, social media seems to be part of Sam's downfall.

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,280
They did an informal promotion for American Nuclear, wearing one of their pride-themed

80
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,880
t-shirts on their social media, specifically saying that the shirt was a great shirt for

81
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,680
me to wear on my flight today.

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,560
My professional society continues to grow and learn and I'm proud of them.

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,320
Goodness, how we have changed since my service as a chapter president.

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,440
And it's the exact same shirt that Sam was wearing while caught on surveillance cameras

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,980
stealing the luggage.

86
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,140
Sam made a $15,000 bail and is due back in court in Minneapolis this time on December

87
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
19.

88
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
That's today.

89
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,920
And yes, I'm recording this video before any new news comes out from that trial.

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,020
I highly doubt anything crazy is going to happen, a lot of this stuff is just procedural

91
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,140
at this point.

92
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,580
Sam asked through an attorney to appear virtually at the Minneapolis court on account of currently

93
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,900
dealing with the Las Vegas trial and traveling being a financial strain while unemployed.

94
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,700
According to some articles, this claim of financial strain might be a hoax, as there's

95
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,340
some reports of Sam's Instagram showing attendance at Boston and New York choral performances,

96
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,100
documentary premieres, and Broadway shows during this apparent tough financial time.

97
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,660
But that is something that I can't confirm, as Sam's Instagram is now private and I

98
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,260
can't find any screencaps, just the words of the journalists who claim to have seen

99
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
it.

100
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,300
Here's the thing, a lot of people had hunches that Sam was doing something weird, including

101
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
me.

102
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,220
None of Sam's sexual activities, the public embracing of kink, the genderfluid stuff,

103
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,820
the LGBT activism, hell, even their legitimately tragic past, none of it is a disqualifier

104
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,340
for public service.

105
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,860
Nor does it render all of their academic and professional experience in nuclear waste that

106
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,700
Sam legitimately has under their belt irrelevant.

107
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Making fun of Sam for the weird viral pics is one thing, it's the internet, we're

108
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,020
having a laugh, it's whatever.

109
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,660
But there was never any evidence that what Sam did off the clock affected their work

110
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,020
at the Department of Energy.

111
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,140
And so, memes aside, it's actually not an issue.

112
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,100
But there's this sense of, it's not about what you show proudly, but what you hide.

113
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,160
And that's a dangerous thing to say, I know.

114
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,700
You can very easily fall down the, if you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing

115
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,460
to hide rabbit hole with that logic.

116
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,740
But I'm not going there.

117
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,100
The thesis of my last video on Sam Brenton was fundamentally on an appeal to good taste.

118
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,180
In my opinion, enjoy whatever type of sex you want in private, no matter how fucking

119
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,220
weird it is.

120
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,540
But you should keep it private.

121
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,900
There's no reason for the world to know what you enjoy in the bedroom, that's for

122
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,100
you and your partner.

123
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,700
And the ability to keep it private is a marker of somebody who has good taste.

124
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,140
Yes, adults have sex, they do it all the time.

125
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,500
And in adult relationships, sex is actually pretty normalized.

126
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,780
I know for like any teenagers listening, or maybe even any adult virgins who are listening,

127
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,700
you might think that sex is this magical thing, and sure, sometimes it can be.

128
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,820
But when you're in a long-term relationship and you're sexually active in that relationship,

129
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,340
the truth is, sex becomes one of those normal things that adults just do.

130
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,100
But all of that is not a reason to normalize your sex life outside of your relationship.

131
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,220
The fact that Sam Brenton was willing not only to make his sex life public, but to make

132
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,820
a career out of it, first as an activist, and then secondly for representation purposes

133
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,220
at the Department of Energy, was a massive red flag for me.

134
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,860
Also, that now-this clip from my previous video sits a lot more uneasily with me than

135
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
it did before.

136
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Not that it was a totally normal thing before, but with the red flag now in mind, I'm starting

137
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,620
to see hints of other ones.

138
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,460
Like look at the language that Sam uses in this clip.

139
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,180
Pronouns are confusing.

140
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm not going to say that they're not.

141
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:13,500
But if I can have the President of the United States use my gender-neutral pronouns, and

142
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:22,100
I can respectfully use theirs, then I think we're going to be in a world where everyone

143
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:29,540
can be respected, and everyone has the responsibility to be respectful.

144
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,380
If I can have the President of the United States use my gender-neutral pronouns, have,

145
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,220
like make them, not ask politely, engage in normal social behavior, give and take, but

146
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,260
demand it, there is an angle of power and subservience that LGBT activists pretend isn't

147
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,820
here, but it's totally here.

148
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,900
Sam Brinton, in this video, looks like a man in a dress.

149
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,300
And you can be a man in a dress all you want, that's cool with me, but at some, emperor

150
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,180
has no clothes level of shit.

151
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,660
To be a man in a dress, demand others not call you a man, and then squeal in victory

152
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,260
after they acquiesce to you.

153
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,600
This is just some good old-fashioned armchair psych from Dev, but I personally think Sam

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,760
gets off on this, and this is a part of their public normalization of kink, just like the

155
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,280
dog stuff was years ago.

156
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,560
He wasn't even getting paid for it, he wasn't in porn or anything, he made it public simply

157
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,960
as a component of normalizing alternative sexualities.

158
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,240
If it turns out that they also have a fetish for stealing women's clothing, which may

159
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,280
very well be the case, I would not be surprised in the least.

160
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,360
Not because they're gay or non-binary, or they're an LGBTQ activist, none of that,

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,880
but because Sam Brinton is a person of low moral character, and their behavior has been

162
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
hinting at that for years.

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,280
Here's an addendum that I'm making while editing.

164
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,040
You know how I said, oh don't worry, I know the second court case is happening right now.

165
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,520
It's fine, no new news will come out about Sam Brinton, we can do this today.

166
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,840
Well you know how it is over here, with me putting my foot in my mouth literally all

167
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
the time.

168
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,520
It turns out that Sam Brinton's horrific childhood tale, which I went over in detail

169
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,040
in the previous video, might be too good to be true.

170
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,800
The Florida conversion therapist that Sam cites in that 2011 interview is remarkably

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,000
hard to find now that more in-depth investigations have begun into their actions.

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,240
The torture that Sam described was commonly in use in conversion therapy in the 1950s,

173
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,800
but the time period when they would have attended conversion therapy was 1999-2001, and no known

174
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,880
conversion therapist in the United States used those exercises at that time.

175
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,440
Tests by investigators and reporters to ask Sam Brinton who was their conversion therapist

176
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,200
and which conversion therapy facility did they attend were met with refusals to answer.

177
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,060
One reporter with the Los Angeles Blade, an LGBTQ-themed newspaper, stated that Sam was

178
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,480
the only survivor of conversion therapy since 1998 who has refused to name and shame their

179
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
abusers.

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Sam claims to not remember the name of their conversion therapist due to trauma, but in

181
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,240
other interviews they describe the clinic as being located in a strip mall in Orlando,

182
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Florida.

183
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,320
That Blade reporter checked with an LGBT-affiliated expert on conversion therapy in the Orlando

184
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,160
region, who confirmed that there was no known conversion therapy office at any strip mall

185
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,080
in Florida from 1999-2001.

186
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,480
The reporter also contacted Sam's mother, who isn't exactly a neutral source of information

187
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,760
herself, let's remember, but she said that Sam never went to conversion therapy.

188
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,800
But he did go to a psychiatrist.

189
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,880
Sam's own testimony has changed as they became more high profile, more recently describing

190
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,240
a licensed psychotherapist who attempted to perform conversion therapy on the side

191
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
rather than an actual conversion therapist.

192
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,640
The reporter personally warned the National Center for Lesbian Rights that Brinton's

193
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,280
story must be verified before he is put forward as a public figure, but the NCLR simply said

194
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,200
we must believe all survivors and moved forward with their spotlighting of Sam Brinton.

195
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,120
It's my personal opinion that Sam Brinton presented this story to various LGBTQ activist

196
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,440
organizations like the NCLR and The Trevor Project in order to quickly gain status within

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,480
those institutions, and what is probably a lie has stuck with him as they moved out of

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,000
student activism and into a professional career.

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,640
Additionally, there's a whole other host of LGBT activists, organizations, and journalists

200
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,520
who have allowed this fraud to continue under the guise of believing all victims, something

201
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,000
that progressives tell me is just a slogan and never actually happens.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,160
In 2011, talking to Queerty, an LGBT outlet, Sam Brinton said I don't want to be the poster

203
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,400
child for the anti-conversion movement.

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,580
Considering how much fame and influence Sam has reaped since then, this is probably the

205
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,520
most false thing they've ever said.
