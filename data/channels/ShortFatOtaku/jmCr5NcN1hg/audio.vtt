00:00.000 --> 00:08.780
It's time to check back in on our old pal, Sam Brinton.

00:08.780 --> 00:12.860
In case you don't know who that is, watch my old video from about 9 months ago.

00:12.860 --> 00:16.500
Pause this one and go check it out, because context is actually pretty important.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.380
Though Sam is kind of a weird person, the previous video wasn't in my Dissecting a

00:21.380 --> 00:25.100
Degenerate series, because Sam is ultimately a tragic figure.

00:25.100 --> 00:30.120
The TLDR of the Sam Brinton story is, as a young boy, he felt an attraction to other

00:30.120 --> 00:35.000
boys his age, prompting his parents to put him through what he described as a viciously

00:35.000 --> 00:37.520
torturous conversion therapy program.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.360
As an adult, Sam became an expert in nuclear waste disposal, pioneered innovations in that

00:42.360 --> 00:47.880
field, and made headlines at the beginning of 2022 for being the first openly non-binary

00:47.880 --> 00:51.800
person to ever sit in a public-facing job in the Department of Energy.

00:51.800 --> 00:59.200
He went from a he-him gay male in his youth and early 20s to a they-them non-binary person

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
in their 30s.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.760
It's hard to know how much of Sam's gender presentation, the kinks, which went viral,

01:04.760 --> 01:09.840
and the extremely flamboyant personality is actually them, and how much of it is an extreme

01:09.840 --> 01:12.920
reaction to the horrific conditions they endured as a child.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.640
Listening to Sam speak about his experiences back in 2011, he's literally just a normal

01:17.640 --> 01:18.640
guy.

01:18.640 --> 01:22.880
He's got a bit of that stereotypical gay lisp that was a big joke in the 2000s.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.060
But if this person hadn't been tortured as a child, maybe they would have just ended

01:26.060 --> 01:31.120
up as a regular gay adult, and not be constantly going more over-the-top in a mad scramble

01:31.120 --> 01:33.440
for love, acceptance, and attention.

01:33.440 --> 01:38.320
Well, Sam is back in the spotlight for a news story I covered in the Weekly Sip a few weeks

01:38.320 --> 01:39.320
back.

01:39.320 --> 01:43.040
US Nuclear Official Charged With Stealing Suitcase From Airport

01:43.040 --> 01:47.460
US nuclear official Sam Brinton is facing accusations that they stole a suitcase at

01:47.460 --> 01:49.620
an airport in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

01:49.620 --> 01:53.620
Court documents reveal that the 35-year-old, who was appointed this year as the head of

01:53.620 --> 01:58.840
spent nuclear fuel management at the Department of Energy, allegedly stole a bag from a carousel

01:58.840 --> 02:03.340
at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, leading to Brinton being charged with felony

02:03.340 --> 02:04.340
theft.

02:04.340 --> 02:08.140
Security footage showed Brinton removing the bag's tag and putting the bag tag in the

02:08.140 --> 02:11.580
handbag they were carrying, and then leaving the area at a quick pace.

02:11.580 --> 02:15.020
Brinton told law enforcement officials that if I had taken the wrong bag I'm happy to

02:15.020 --> 02:17.560
return it, but I don't have any clothes for another individual.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.680
That was my clothes when I opened the bag.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.900
Brinton got in touch with airport staff later to say that they hadn't been completely

02:23.900 --> 02:26.340
honest and admitted to taking the blue bag.

02:26.340 --> 02:30.060
They said they were tired and took the suitcase thinking it was theirs.

02:30.060 --> 02:33.700
Brinton grew nervous after opening the bag as they realized it wasn't theirs.

02:33.700 --> 02:37.120
They said they became nervous because people would think they stole the bag and didn't

02:37.120 --> 02:38.120
know what to do.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.040
Okay, so this sounds like an honest mistake, right?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.360
Sam steals the woman's bag.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.380
If you're in a rush, no one's going to check what's in it right away.

02:43.380 --> 02:46.060
Back in the hotel room, it's filled with women's clothing suddenly.

02:46.060 --> 02:48.900
And that isn't a red flag for Sam, considering.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.500
Everything seems reasonable here.

02:50.500 --> 02:55.000
Except of course, that security footage showing Sam removing the baggage tag and then taking

02:55.000 --> 02:56.420
off at a quick pace.

02:56.420 --> 02:59.780
And the fact that Sam appears to have stolen the woman's clothing.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.780
Brinton said they left the clothes from the bag in a drawer at the Intercontinental St.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.940
Paul Riverfront Hotel, but no clothing was recovered from the hotel room, said the cops.

03:07.940 --> 03:08.940
That's a big oof.

03:08.940 --> 03:12.980
And a lot of us who heard this story on social media thought it was just going to be a one-time

03:12.980 --> 03:13.980
thing.

03:13.980 --> 03:18.320
But it turns out Sam might actually be a serial woman's clothing thief.

03:18.320 --> 03:23.860
Non-binary Biden nuclear official Sam Brinton accused in a second luggage heist.

03:23.860 --> 03:28.380
A Biden administration Energy Department official who allegedly stole a woman's suitcase from

03:28.380 --> 03:32.620
a Minneapolis airport in September has been accused of another luggage heist at a Las

03:32.620 --> 03:33.940
Vegas airport.

03:33.940 --> 03:38.540
A felony warrant on grand larceny charges was issued on Thursday.

03:38.540 --> 03:41.740
And yes, this has led to Sam Brinton losing his job.

03:41.740 --> 03:46.460
Initially, after that first case hit the news cycle, Sam was placed on temporary leave

03:46.460 --> 03:48.020
by the Department of Energy.

03:48.020 --> 03:52.820
But now that we know it's not a one-off thing, non-binary Biden nuclear official Sam

03:52.820 --> 03:56.260
Brinton fired after multiple luggage theft charges.

03:56.260 --> 04:00.500
The Department of Energy has confirmed that Sam has been let go, but due to confidentiality,

04:00.500 --> 04:02.660
can't comment on the case further.

04:02.660 --> 04:08.180
Sam faces a possible $10,000 fine and up to five years in jail for the Minnesota theft

04:08.180 --> 04:10.520
and another 10 for the Las Vegas one.

04:10.520 --> 04:14.780
Both suitcases were stuffed full of women's clothing, makeup, and jewelry judged to be

04:14.780 --> 04:20.520
worth several thousand dollars per suitcase, and Sam was seen publicly using those stolen

04:20.520 --> 04:23.440
suitcases during their subsequent travels.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.140
Sam appeared in a Las Vegas courtroom on Wednesday, December 14.

04:27.140 --> 04:31.540
This mega-mind-looking mugshot made the rounds on social media, which finally clued in the

04:31.540 --> 04:35.240
normies to what's going on and made him remember the previous news stories.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.800
In fact, social media seems to be part of Sam's downfall.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.280
They did an informal promotion for American Nuclear, wearing one of their pride-themed

04:43.280 --> 04:47.880
t-shirts on their social media, specifically saying that the shirt was a great shirt for

04:47.880 --> 04:49.680
me to wear on my flight today.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.560
My professional society continues to grow and learn and I'm proud of them.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.320
Goodness, how we have changed since my service as a chapter president.

04:57.320 --> 05:02.440
And it's the exact same shirt that Sam was wearing while caught on surveillance cameras

05:02.440 --> 05:03.980
stealing the luggage.

05:03.980 --> 05:09.140
Sam made a $15,000 bail and is due back in court in Minneapolis this time on December

05:09.140 --> 05:10.140
19.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.140
That's today.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.920
And yes, I'm recording this video before any new news comes out from that trial.

05:14.920 --> 05:19.020
I highly doubt anything crazy is going to happen, a lot of this stuff is just procedural

05:19.020 --> 05:20.140
at this point.

05:20.140 --> 05:24.580
Sam asked through an attorney to appear virtually at the Minneapolis court on account of currently

05:24.580 --> 05:29.900
dealing with the Las Vegas trial and traveling being a financial strain while unemployed.

05:29.900 --> 05:34.700
According to some articles, this claim of financial strain might be a hoax, as there's

05:34.700 --> 05:40.340
some reports of Sam's Instagram showing attendance at Boston and New York choral performances,

05:40.340 --> 05:45.100
documentary premieres, and Broadway shows during this apparent tough financial time.

05:45.100 --> 05:49.660
But that is something that I can't confirm, as Sam's Instagram is now private and I

05:49.660 --> 05:53.260
can't find any screencaps, just the words of the journalists who claim to have seen

05:53.260 --> 05:54.260
it.

05:54.260 --> 05:58.300
Here's the thing, a lot of people had hunches that Sam was doing something weird, including

05:58.300 --> 05:59.300
me.

05:59.700 --> 06:04.220
None of Sam's sexual activities, the public embracing of kink, the genderfluid stuff,

06:04.220 --> 06:09.820
the LGBT activism, hell, even their legitimately tragic past, none of it is a disqualifier

06:09.820 --> 06:11.340
for public service.

06:11.340 --> 06:15.860
Nor does it render all of their academic and professional experience in nuclear waste that

06:15.860 --> 06:18.700
Sam legitimately has under their belt irrelevant.

06:18.700 --> 06:22.700
Making fun of Sam for the weird viral pics is one thing, it's the internet, we're

06:22.700 --> 06:24.020
having a laugh, it's whatever.

06:24.020 --> 06:28.660
But there was never any evidence that what Sam did off the clock affected their work

06:29.020 --> 06:30.020
at the Department of Energy.

06:30.020 --> 06:33.140
And so, memes aside, it's actually not an issue.

06:33.140 --> 06:37.100
But there's this sense of, it's not about what you show proudly, but what you hide.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.160
And that's a dangerous thing to say, I know.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.700
You can very easily fall down the, if you have nothing to fear, then you have nothing

06:42.700 --> 06:44.460
to hide rabbit hole with that logic.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.740
But I'm not going there.

06:45.740 --> 06:51.100
The thesis of my last video on Sam Brenton was fundamentally on an appeal to good taste.

06:51.100 --> 06:55.180
In my opinion, enjoy whatever type of sex you want in private, no matter how fucking

06:55.180 --> 06:56.220
weird it is.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.540
But you should keep it private.

06:57.820 --> 07:00.900
There's no reason for the world to know what you enjoy in the bedroom, that's for

07:00.900 --> 07:02.100
you and your partner.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.700
And the ability to keep it private is a marker of somebody who has good taste.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.140
Yes, adults have sex, they do it all the time.

07:08.140 --> 07:11.500
And in adult relationships, sex is actually pretty normalized.

07:11.500 --> 07:15.780
I know for like any teenagers listening, or maybe even any adult virgins who are listening,

07:15.780 --> 07:19.700
you might think that sex is this magical thing, and sure, sometimes it can be.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.820
But when you're in a long-term relationship and you're sexually active in that relationship,

07:23.820 --> 07:28.340
the truth is, sex becomes one of those normal things that adults just do.

07:28.340 --> 07:34.100
But all of that is not a reason to normalize your sex life outside of your relationship.

07:34.100 --> 07:39.220
The fact that Sam Brenton was willing not only to make his sex life public, but to make

07:39.220 --> 07:43.820
a career out of it, first as an activist, and then secondly for representation purposes

07:43.820 --> 07:47.220
at the Department of Energy, was a massive red flag for me.

07:47.220 --> 07:52.860
Also, that now-this clip from my previous video sits a lot more uneasily with me than

07:52.900 --> 07:53.900
it did before.

07:53.900 --> 07:57.900
Not that it was a totally normal thing before, but with the red flag now in mind, I'm starting

07:57.900 --> 07:59.620
to see hints of other ones.

07:59.620 --> 08:02.460
Like look at the language that Sam uses in this clip.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.180
Pronouns are confusing.

08:04.180 --> 08:06.820
I'm not going to say that they're not.

08:06.820 --> 08:13.500
But if I can have the President of the United States use my gender-neutral pronouns, and

08:13.500 --> 08:22.100
I can respectfully use theirs, then I think we're going to be in a world where everyone

08:22.100 --> 08:29.540
can be respected, and everyone has the responsibility to be respectful.

08:29.540 --> 08:34.380
If I can have the President of the United States use my gender-neutral pronouns, have,

08:34.380 --> 08:39.220
like make them, not ask politely, engage in normal social behavior, give and take, but

08:39.220 --> 08:45.260
demand it, there is an angle of power and subservience that LGBT activists pretend isn't

08:45.260 --> 08:46.820
here, but it's totally here.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.900
Sam Brinton, in this video, looks like a man in a dress.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.300
And you can be a man in a dress all you want, that's cool with me, but at some, emperor

08:53.300 --> 08:55.180
has no clothes level of shit.

08:55.180 --> 08:59.660
To be a man in a dress, demand others not call you a man, and then squeal in victory

08:59.660 --> 09:01.260
after they acquiesce to you.

09:01.260 --> 09:05.600
This is just some good old-fashioned armchair psych from Dev, but I personally think Sam

09:05.600 --> 09:09.760
gets off on this, and this is a part of their public normalization of kink, just like the

09:09.760 --> 09:11.280
dog stuff was years ago.

09:11.280 --> 09:15.560
He wasn't even getting paid for it, he wasn't in porn or anything, he made it public simply

09:15.560 --> 09:18.960
as a component of normalizing alternative sexualities.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.240
If it turns out that they also have a fetish for stealing women's clothing, which may

09:22.240 --> 09:25.280
very well be the case, I would not be surprised in the least.

09:25.280 --> 09:30.360
Not because they're gay or non-binary, or they're an LGBTQ activist, none of that,

09:30.360 --> 09:34.880
but because Sam Brinton is a person of low moral character, and their behavior has been

09:34.880 --> 09:37.200
hinting at that for years.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.280
Here's an addendum that I'm making while editing.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.040
You know how I said, oh don't worry, I know the second court case is happening right now.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.520
It's fine, no new news will come out about Sam Brinton, we can do this today.

09:49.520 --> 09:52.840
Well you know how it is over here, with me putting my foot in my mouth literally all

09:52.840 --> 09:53.840
the time.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.520
It turns out that Sam Brinton's horrific childhood tale, which I went over in detail

09:57.520 --> 10:00.040
in the previous video, might be too good to be true.

10:00.040 --> 10:04.800
The Florida conversion therapist that Sam cites in that 2011 interview is remarkably

10:04.800 --> 10:10.000
hard to find now that more in-depth investigations have begun into their actions.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.240
The torture that Sam described was commonly in use in conversion therapy in the 1950s,

10:15.240 --> 10:20.800
but the time period when they would have attended conversion therapy was 1999-2001, and no known

10:20.800 --> 10:25.880
conversion therapist in the United States used those exercises at that time.

10:25.880 --> 10:30.440
Tests by investigators and reporters to ask Sam Brinton who was their conversion therapist

10:30.440 --> 10:35.200
and which conversion therapy facility did they attend were met with refusals to answer.

10:35.200 --> 10:40.060
One reporter with the Los Angeles Blade, an LGBTQ-themed newspaper, stated that Sam was

10:40.060 --> 10:46.480
the only survivor of conversion therapy since 1998 who has refused to name and shame their

10:46.480 --> 10:47.480
abusers.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.200
Sam claims to not remember the name of their conversion therapist due to trauma, but in

10:51.200 --> 10:55.240
other interviews they describe the clinic as being located in a strip mall in Orlando,

10:55.240 --> 10:56.240
Florida.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.320
That Blade reporter checked with an LGBT-affiliated expert on conversion therapy in the Orlando

11:01.320 --> 11:06.160
region, who confirmed that there was no known conversion therapy office at any strip mall

11:06.160 --> 11:09.080
in Florida from 1999-2001.

11:09.080 --> 11:13.480
The reporter also contacted Sam's mother, who isn't exactly a neutral source of information

11:13.480 --> 11:16.760
herself, let's remember, but she said that Sam never went to conversion therapy.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.800
But he did go to a psychiatrist.

11:18.800 --> 11:23.880
Sam's own testimony has changed as they became more high profile, more recently describing

11:23.880 --> 11:28.240
a licensed psychotherapist who attempted to perform conversion therapy on the side

11:28.240 --> 11:30.480
rather than an actual conversion therapist.

11:30.480 --> 11:35.640
The reporter personally warned the National Center for Lesbian Rights that Brinton's

11:35.640 --> 11:41.280
story must be verified before he is put forward as a public figure, but the NCLR simply said

11:41.280 --> 11:46.200
we must believe all survivors and moved forward with their spotlighting of Sam Brinton.

11:46.200 --> 11:51.120
It's my personal opinion that Sam Brinton presented this story to various LGBTQ activist

11:51.120 --> 11:55.440
organizations like the NCLR and The Trevor Project in order to quickly gain status within

11:55.440 --> 12:00.480
those institutions, and what is probably a lie has stuck with him as they moved out of

12:00.480 --> 12:03.000
student activism and into a professional career.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.640
Additionally, there's a whole other host of LGBT activists, organizations, and journalists

12:08.640 --> 12:13.520
who have allowed this fraud to continue under the guise of believing all victims, something

12:13.520 --> 12:17.000
that progressives tell me is just a slogan and never actually happens.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.160
In 2011, talking to Queerty, an LGBT outlet, Sam Brinton said I don't want to be the poster

12:22.160 --> 12:24.400
child for the anti-conversion movement.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.580
Considering how much fame and influence Sam has reaped since then, this is probably the

12:28.580 --> 12:30.520
most false thing they've ever said.
