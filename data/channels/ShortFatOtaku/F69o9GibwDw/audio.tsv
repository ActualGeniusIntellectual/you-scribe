0	4560	You know, I've had this video in me for a while, and I'm actually pretty happy that
4560	11760	I decided to record it after yesterday's Vampire the Masquerade stream over on ArchWarhammer's
11760	16880	channel, which by the way, you should go watch if you haven't already. Arch is DMing, it's me,
16880	23760	Sargon, Rags, and Uzulu playing in a Vampire the Masquerade game. Oh, also Kyle's there too,
23760	27440	he's a new guy. But we're playing Vampire the Masquerade, a tabletop game, we're playing it
27440	32880	online, and it's a lot of fun, it's called In the Claws of the Eagle. In any case, during one of
32880	38160	these streams, which by the way happen every Wednesday at 2.30pm EST, we were looking through
38160	41840	the Vampire the Masquerade rulebook, the most recent one, the one that we're using for the game,
41840	46640	and we found this passage, advice for considerate play. I'm not going to read it all because it's
46640	50080	huge, but here's a few choice quotes. One of the best things about role-playing is that you can
50080	54960	play someone different from yourself. No gender, ethnicity, sexual preference, disability, class,
54960	60480	or position in society is off limits, but remember that this freedom comes with a responsibility
60480	65680	to your fellow players. For instance, your table may include people who identify as trans, and
65680	70000	whether they plan to transition or not, they will probably not feel comfortable if you portray the
70000	75120	trans experience as a simple preference or a condition to be cured, or if you just assume
75120	80720	that all of their characters are also trans. Always respect your players' identities. Vampire
80720	87280	the Masquerade is not a fascist-friendly game. If you are a neo-nazi, alt-writer, or whatever it is
87280	92160	you're calling yourself nowadays, we urge you to put this book down and call someone who you trust
92160	98080	to talk about where you went wrong in your life. That said, Kindred culture is inherently monstrous.
98080	102480	Part of the political horror of Vampire the Masquerade is surviving in a culture that
102480	108560	worships the bad old ways. Large parts of Kindred society, especially the Camarilla and the Sabbat,
108560	113600	adhere to cults of tradition, ascribe to the idea of humiliating their enemies with overwhelming
113600	118560	wealth and force, and praise religious fundamentalism or even pre-modern ideas.
118560	122960	Even so, it's pretty easy to steer the game away from totalitarian perspectives.
122960	127600	Emphasize the differences between individual vampires. Tell stories about infighting,
127600	132800	surprising kindness, and new ideas. Play as thin-bloods, katif, or anarchs.
132800	138000	Portray Kindred society in all of its malicious and fascist glory, but let the player characters
138000	143200	oppose the system. What if someone wants to play a fascist, though? Or the storyteller wants
143200	148480	fascist NPCs? There are plenty of those throughout the world of darkness. Monsters with pretty faces.
148480	153760	They can be a tragic villain, or a former friend who fell. They might be the Brugge neo-nazi,
153760	158960	the far-right Ventrue billionaire, or the semester eugenicist. Whatever face they present,
158960	162400	the player characters should be given the satisfaction of redeeming or destroying them
162400	167040	eventually. After all, the player characters are something unique and special,
167040	170720	something fascists cannot abide. Well, thankfully, in Arch's campaign,
170720	175200	we're all playing a bunch of Nazis fighting against Russian communists during World War II.
175200	179120	We're German soldiers on the Eastern Front who also happen to be vampires. And the campaign
179120	183360	is set largely outside of the influence of the Camarilla, because the Nazis have always had this
183360	186640	weird thing going on with the occult. You must remember Indiana Jones, right, where they go
186640	190400	looking for artifacts and stuff to try and help the war effort. We're kind of playing those type
190400	196240	of Nazis. So there's basically like a paranormal research unit that the player characters are
196240	201520	attached to, and it's honestly a lot of really goofy, schlocky fun. Like Sargon is literally
201520	207200	the villain from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rags is playing as a gangrel who can shapeshift into
207200	212880	a walrus. I'm playing as the obligatory 1000-year-old vampire loli. In whose lieu is
212880	218800	Jurgen Panzersen, which is just a Nazi retelling of Jordan Peterson. He even has a best-selling
218800	224240	book, 12 Rules for Reich. But my point is, Vampire the Masquerade, when it was originally conceived,
224240	229120	didn't used to be this. The point of the game, and in fact it even says it in the rule book
229120	234560	elsewhere, the point of the game is that there are no heroes in vampire society. At some point,
234560	239440	every single character you encounter has to take blood from somebody. And they might have these
239440	244880	societies or these traditions or these methods by which they hold themselves together, but deep
244880	249680	down they're all in some way monstrous. And in fact that's often the objection to running vampire
249680	254160	campaigns, is that there's no heroes. You can't play a heroic character. And this passage actually
254160	260160	talks about character archetypes that make complete sense in the vampire lore. The Brugge Neo-Nazi,
260160	264400	the far-right Ventrue billionaire. You don't need to know the specifics of those clans to
264400	268320	understand what kind of characters they are, and they actually make complete sense within the lore.
268320	273520	But because I guess everything is run by social justice nowadays, we need a page in the rule book
273520	277760	saying, yeah we might have put the stats in the book for some reason, but you shouldn't play as
277760	283360	this. Don't. Don't do it. The tabletop situation needs to be a friendly and open and welcoming
283360	289040	space. I mean, at least according to the BBC. No offense, but Dungeon and Dragons isn't just for
289040	294080	nerds anymore. Not just for a bunch of beardy boys in the basement. It's for everybody and anybody.
294080	298960	It's so social, the most social game you have to play in fact. All you need is a few friends and a
298960	304160	dungeon master or game master to kind of run the game and tell you your story. It's this wonderful
304160	308560	escapism from real life, like acting or writing, but you're doing it as a group. And it can be
308560	313840	really good for people with anxiety, socializing issues, mobility issues, to kind of play somebody
313840	319200	else and experiment with their personality. It's got its problems, like most games to be honest,
319200	324480	with diversity and inclusion, but there's groups out there working on it, there's teams out there
324480	328320	working on it, and like even the creators are working on it. Okay, okay, okay. I guess it's
328320	332480	friendly and opening and welcome to everyone unless you have a beard, all right? It's not
332480	336880	just Vampire that has this problem though, obviously. Call of Cthulhu shows we need to
336880	342720	move past H.P. Lovecraft once and for all. Aside from his history of racism, Lovecraft's ideas are
342720	347040	so saturated they're no longer interesting fodder for horror games. I think we're all set on
347040	352080	Lovecraft games for a while, though let me just say I'm not talking about Lovecraft's racism,
352080	357520	which let's be honest, is real bad. The dude was racist. Games really need to fall out of love with
357520	362640	Lovecraft. I'm not keen on mincing words on this one. H.P. Lovecraft was a racist. Cthulhu game
362640	368560	creators acknowledge that Lovecraft was a racist. And you know what? By modern standards, Lovecraft
368560	372080	probably was. I haven't looked into it, so I don't know if he is or not, but let's just assume that
372080	376480	by modern standards he is. You still can't hold him to those modern standards though, can you?
376480	381360	Because he didn't exist in modern society. He didn't live in modern culture. I mean, if you
381360	386400	can have cultural relativism for all of these backwards ass religions that come in and destroy
386400	390800	western civilization simply on the grounds of it's their culture, then surely you can have
390800	396160	temporal cultural relativism, right? I mean, why not? Here, if there actually happens to be any
396160	399920	kind of social justice-y tags listening to this, I'm gonna blow your mind right now, alright?
399920	404960	You cannot judge somebody for living up to your present ideals if they existed in the past,
404960	410640	and here's why. Political advancement is exactly like scientific advancement or technological
410640	416720	advancement. You have to think about things for a while and iterate on ideas. You have to discover
416720	420400	things and create things. You have to invent things. Believe it or not, there was once a
420400	425840	point in human history where every single person did not know that people of a different race from
425840	430560	them were also humans, and that's something that we had to figure out. And it's actually not fair
430560	434400	to judge people in the past who thought that way by modern standards. I mean, would you do it for
434400	438480	technology? Would you consider the medieval peasant to be morally deficient because he has
438480	443440	no idea what a computer is? Well, no, obviously not. Well, the same goes with political or
443440	447600	philosophical discoveries. It's easy for you to think of all the liberal norms we take for
447600	451680	granted today as being universal, but they're not universal. We had to discover that shit,
451680	456560	and yet here we are. While developing Fate of Cthulhu, we were obligated to reflect on the
456560	460960	problematic roots of the source material. We tackle that on page six. The mythos is definitely
460960	466560	worth exploring. It's also worth re-examining. Ah, yes, of course. Make money off of this extremely
466560	471120	profitable available IP, but also make sure to lecture to your audience about how problematic
471120	475280	the IP actually is and how bad it is that they want to enjoy it. All right, let's see what it
475280	480640	says. Fate of Cthulhu is a game that deals with many hard topics, including mental health,
480640	484320	systemic abuses of power, and the deaths of huge portions of the human species.
484320	488560	Make sure all the players are aware of these things and give enthusiastic consent before
488560	494080	they begin playing. Also, H.P. Lovecraft was a racist and anti-Semite. There, we said it.
494080	498160	You know, I don't buy a game, whether it's a video game or a tabletop game or whatever it is.
498160	502960	I don't plunk money down on this shit to be virtue signaled at and to be talked down to by
502960	508080	people who have no idea what they're actually saying. We are in a strange universe where the
508080	513520	radical left has gone so crazy that they've looped back around and basically become the new Jack
513520	517280	Chick. If some of you guys are too young to remember him, well, he made these really terrible
517280	522480	Christian comics talking about the dangers of Satanism and D&D. But today tabletop isn't
522480	528000	demonic. It's just problematic. As a quick side note, what's really funny is that in our
528000	534320	very obviously Nazi vampire game over on Archer's channel, we discovered all of this stuff in the
534320	538880	vampire rulebook weeks before it went viral, but it did go viral. It went viral a couple of days
538880	543360	ago. If you thought the fate of Cthulhu entry complaining about Lovecraft was cringe, I present
543360	547760	to you Vampire the Masquerade. No fascists. If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this
547760	552480	game. It's against the rules. If you're reading this and thinking you just call everyone you
552480	560560	disagree with a fascist, then you're probably a fascist. Oops, I guess we broke the rule.
560560	564640	I do hope our examination of these passages on stream a few weeks ago somehow contributed to
564640	569600	this going viral. Or maybe it's our stream itself because, you know, we generally get between 500
569600	574400	and 1000 people watching the Vampire the Masquerade sessions every week. And that actually
574400	579040	puts us in the realm of one of the more popular vampire streams on the entire internet. For
579040	584720	example, you've got Seattle by Night, which is a Vampire the Masquerade campaign run by Penny
584720	589920	Arcade. And Penny Arcade's a big deal. You know, they run PAX. They invented the idea of the modern
589920	595520	webcomic. They were one of the first real content creators on the internet. They run their Vampire
595520	599360	the Masquerade campaign on their Twitch channel. They get less viewers than us, both in terms of
599360	603840	live viewers and viewers after the fact. Their chat room, as you can probably see,
603840	608800	is a lot less rowdy, is a lot less engaged. It has a lot less activity. I don't want to knock
608800	612960	these guys because I actually remember reading Penny Arcade quite a bit back in the day when
612960	619120	they still had their edge. And PAX is certainly a success in its own right. But it seems like
619120	624000	the more popular option is a bunch of shitlords on the internet just playing it on Roll20. You've
624000	629200	also got Geek and Sundry's Vampire the Masquerade campaign. This is, if you don't know,
629200	633760	Felicia Day's channel, basically. I mean, it's not just her. There's a whole group of them, but it's
633760	640400	most well known for Felicia Day's involvement. And they have, you know, over 2 million subscribers,
640400	644640	half a million followers on Twitch. They have the official endorsement of World of Darkness,
644640	648720	you know, the people who create Vampire the Masquerade. And yet their campaign doesn't
648720	655280	really seem to be that much popular than ours. It is. Our streams tend to get between 10 and 20k
655280	662800	viewers after the fact. Theirs get between 80 and say 50 after the fact. So they're definitely more
662800	669120	popular than us, but not by a huge amount, despite having all of this backing. And I think it's
669120	673680	primarily because, you know, these guys and also the Penny Arcade guys, you know, they're playing
673680	679360	very tame campaigns. You know, they're quite afraid to be a little bit edgy, even though it's
680160	686560	literally a game about vampires being edgy. Like this is, if there was going to be a tabletop game
686560	690960	where edginess is the norm, it's supposed to be Vampire the Masquerade. By the way,
690960	696320	I discovered those games because of this Twitter account, Vancouver by Night. This is another
696320	700080	Vampire the Masquerade campaign apparently happening in Vancouver. It seems like a lot of
700080	705600	the campaigns just have like the name of their city and then by night. I think that's because
705600	710080	the official Vampire the Masquerade rulebook literally says, if you can't figure out a setting,
710080	714880	just set it in your hometown and just, you know, play, you know, just play places that,
714880	718480	you know, basically. And it's like, well, that's, I guess, but it's not really that fun.
718480	722240	This group says that they added games to the list and it's like, if there are any other games
722240	729120	represented that, you know, let me know. Hashtag Vammily. I applied our game to be on this list.
729120	733520	And they were just like, do you have a link to the Twitch? And shortly after this,
733520	738800	they stopped replying to me because I think they figured out exactly what kind of game we were
738800	746000	playing. Literally role playing as Nazis, you guys, literally. However, it was through this
746000	751040	list that I realized most people who play Vampire the Masquerade, especially online, they're,
751040	756160	they're social justice warriors themselves. And I don't mean just the big ones like Penny Arcade or
756160	761840	Felicia Day with Geek and Sundry. Ah, yes. The old chestnut of version five, not being a true
761840	766480	Vampire the Masquerade game because it doesn't cover bad things argument. Yes. One can play a
766480	772320	nasty piece of shit in their game. Does that mean we welcome actual fascists, racists and sexist
772320	778880	people? Fuck no. It's the whole Bruja being Nazis shit again. And no point in either text is said
778880	783280	that it's okay for these groups of people to exist in the real world, but it does acknowledge their
783280	788240	existence. If anything, I admire the writer's wording for actually mocking these scumbags.
788240	794480	The World of Darkness is more than the all nasty shit that end with ists. The World of Darkness is
794480	799040	the battle with oneself as a vampire coming to terms with your condition. It is not a game of
799040	805280	how to be offensive and insensitive. Of course, these things can be explored in the games if done
805280	810240	properly. They already exist to a very mild extent in the game's canon. But if you really think that
810240	814320	anything goes because it's the World of Darkness, piss off. We don't want you in our games.
814320	819280	All right, so vampires, no problem. Blood sucking creatures of the night. Okay.
819920	824720	Literally cursed by the devil and turned away from all that is good and holy in the world.
825280	832880	Completely fine. But don't you dare be a fucking racist. And this isn't me advocating for racism.
832880	838960	This is me advocating for common sense. It's me advocating for racism's rightful spot
838960	843760	in the hierarchy of evil things. So you want to put racism in your fantasy game.
843760	847920	A DM's guide to implementing real world racism analogies into fictional worlds
847920	853600	by white people. Me for white people. You all. Step one, don't. There's absolutely no reason for
853600	858880	it. Realism? Bullshit. There are elves and dragons and magic. Grittiness? There's plenty of other
858880	864240	stuff and tropes to use that don't perpetuate harmful like that. Harmful like that? Creating
864240	868960	conflict? Again, plenty of other options that don't rely on IRL racism. The only people who
868960	873760	should use themes like these in their games are the ones actually affected by it. As a trans
873760	878960	person, it can feel super fucking cathartic and awesome to combat and smash transphobic bullshit
878960	884640	in game. That's because we decide to handle the topic. On the other hand, when a cis person
884640	889520	decides to put transphobia in their game, or a white person with racism, they just end up
889520	894720	perpetuating the same harmful shittiness that we try to escape from when playing D&D. So if
894720	898800	you're a white DM, unless you have a person of color in your group and they specifically ask you
898800	903760	to put something like this in your game so they can handle it, don't. Okay, so by that logic,
903760	908960	since we've all been branded as alt-right neo-Nazis and we're playing original Nazis in
908960	914960	our campaign, it's fine, right? I mean, personally, as a Nazi person, it can feel super fucking
914960	921920	cathartic and awesome to combat and smash Russian communism bullshit in game. It's the same logic.
922800	928080	It's also, by the way, why the logic is stupid. You are not your character. You know, if you're
928080	932400	playing an orc barbarian in D&D, you're not actually an orc barbarian in real life.
933600	938960	If you're playing a racist character, you're not actually a racist in real life. I was never a fat
938960	944640	black monk, nor was I ever a loli vampire Nazi. Just because something is portrayed in a fictional
944640	950480	setting doesn't mean that the creator of the fictional setting actually exposes that ideology.
950480	954960	It's just a game. And I'll say it's just a game to you types in the same way that I would say it to
954960	959680	both Anita Sarkeesian and Jack Thompson when it comes to video games. It's just a fucking game.
959680	966960	By the way, for some people, Vampire the Masquerade didn't go far enough in its rebuke of Nazism.
967520	972880	If you aren't hiring experts, you'll end up with coded Nazi language and harmful messages in your
972880	977920	vammily Vampire the Masquerade games. Please, this isn't something you can just wing,
977920	981920	not with the status of our fandom. There's plenty of people with amazing qualifications that will
981920	986080	have a serious critical look at your creations and help you make sure your mechanics,
986080	990320	narratives, and systems aren't accidentally condoning Nazi ideals
990320	995600	or putting authoritarian regimes on a pedestal. You can't afford to act like a dude in a garage
995600	1001360	doing a niche product. You're using a multi-million dollar worth IP that's known for having welcomed
1001360	1007200	Nazis because they're clients. You need to take active measures, else your neutrality will kill
1007200	1011840	us. I'm even going to need to add that your spoken messages and written credos in the vammily
1011840	1016400	need to be followed by actual action, especially when you don't apologize to victims of your
1016400	1020640	abuser staff. Your disclaimer means nothing if you still support them and promote them.
1020640	1025760	I must insist, Vampire the Masquerade and World of Darkness aren't a couple of dudes in a garage
1025760	1032000	anymore. You have a duty, as content creators, to educate yourself and not be a bigot, not doxxing
1032000	1037200	minors, have meaningful and well-designed representation, not put in pet play for shock
1037200	1043680	and edge value, be mature, but real maturity isn't that. Yes, your NPCs and your society is
1043680	1049360	a clusterfuck of leeches with all of the ism behaviors, but you need to show it as a problem,
1049360	1053520	not as something to glorify. I mean, the whole point is to play as somebody that you're not,
1053520	1059280	right? Like, I'm not Mario. I'm not Link. Whenever I play those games, I don't believe myself to be
1059280	1063920	them. You're taking on a role. It's a role-playing game. The whole point is that you take on a role
1063920	1068720	that you're not. I think the biggest problem I have with it, though, is that yes, Vampire
1068720	1072240	the Masquerade was meant to be like the edgy tabletop, you know, because Dungeons and Dragons
1072240	1076960	wasn't really that edgy. Maybe first edition was with all the crazy illustrations in the rule book,
1076960	1082320	but in general, Vampire the Masquerade was like, if you want to be an edgy teen goth shithead,
1082320	1086320	here's the game for you. It's all about being creatures of the night and having like inner
1086320	1091200	turmoil and drama and all this BS, but to suddenly turn around and say that you can no longer
1091200	1095600	be edgy in a property designed for edginess just seems to be counterproductive to me.
1095600	1100560	You know, if you were ever going to play ridiculous Nazi vampires, Vampire the Masquerade
1100560	1105280	would be the game to play it in. And then I'm reminded of the film genre Nazi-sploitation,
1105280	1109040	which I think peaked in the in the 70s or something. And the whole point of that genre of
1109040	1116160	film was that you would basically portray the Nazis in the most schlocky, hilarious and goofy,
1116160	1122480	but equally also insane and nightmarish fashion that you possibly could. It was equal parts
1122480	1128560	horror and hilarity. And you know, Vampire the Masquerade has a lot in common, tonally,
1128560	1132640	at least with Nazi-sploitation. Like if you were to go back and play the computer game that made
1132640	1137520	the series well known, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, you'll pretty quickly notice that
1137520	1143040	it is also full of some pretty goofy nonsense. It is a serious game with amazing music,
1143040	1149120	a tabletop accurate level up system and a really engaging story. But it also has quirky characters,
1149120	1154160	goofy side quests, and it's generally not afraid to make fun of itself. It does seem to be the
1154160	1160080	sense of humor that that marries Vampire the Masquerade and Nazi-sploitation so well together.
1160080	1165120	They're both internally very serious, but the real world people who engage with them often do so
1165120	1170000	just for fun. And half of the enjoyment comes from taking the piss out of it. But most importantly
1170000	1176240	of all, nobody thought that Nazi-sploitation portrayed the Nazis in a positive light.
1176240	1181280	And honestly, in my opinion, those movies are great. Not because they're like, they're actually
1181280	1186320	like Hitler's true vision of fascism or something, you know, far from it, but it's because it
1186320	1192720	basically parodies the Nazis and it turns them into a joke, which is fundamentally what they are.
1192720	1197360	And if you want to know how you combat Nazis, like the real neo-Nazis that do exist, a few of
1197360	1201920	them that are still kicking around nowadays, is you turn them into a joke. You laugh at them.
1201920	1206160	They don't hold political power anywhere. No one actually cares about their ideas.
1206160	1211840	They're a bunch of fucking losers. And bringing up like the great Nazi scare as if they're somehow
1211840	1214720	relevant, it seems like you're making them a bigger problem than they actually are.
1215440	1219920	And you know what? That gives them power. Especially if you take people who
1219920	1225120	make jokes about Nazis, like say, Dankula and his saluting pug, you take them and make them
1225120	1230640	fucking criminals for joking about it. Like whose honor are you defending when you do that?
1230640	1234960	When you say no fascists are allowed to play Vampire the Masquerade, you can't depict Nazis
1234960	1240240	in this game. You know, are you defending Hitler's honor? You know, do not be a liberal iconoclast
1240240	1246000	against the sacred Nazi cow. But you know what? It's completely okay because Arch had us all fill
1246000	1252720	out this handy dandy RPG consent form when we first started playing Vampire the Masquerade.
1252720	1256720	All right. And this thing, this thing is just great. You know, you can absolutely put in all
1256720	1260080	the things that trigger you. So you don't even have to be exposed to them. So you can go on
1260080	1263360	living in your hug box for the rest of your life. And you know, there's actually some really good
1263360	1267760	stuff here. All right. Let's look over it. Right. So for example, we have the GM name. That would be
1268720	1272880	Arch. That's him. The planned game theme would obviously be Nazis.
1272880	1279760	Nazi. Mark the color that best illustrate your comfort level with the following plot or story
1279760	1286480	elements. Green. Enthusiastic consent. Bring it on. Yellow. Okay if veiled or off stage.
1286480	1292720	Might be okay on stage, but requires discussion ahead of time. Uncertain. Red. Hard line. Do not
1292720	1299120	include. Okay. Well, let's let's go through this. All right. So horror. Bugs. They're kind of icky,
1299120	1304400	so no. All right. Blood. Well, it's a vampire game, I understand, but still no blood in this
1304400	1309680	game. All right. All right. Demons. Well, you know, after the new Doom trailer, I'm kind of
1309680	1313520	triggered by them. So no thanks. Eyeballs. No, I mean, absolutely not. I keep my eyes closed all
1313520	1319200	the time. Gore. No, of course not. Harm to animals. No, because I'm a vegan, obviously.
1319200	1327520	Harm to children. Yes, because I'm also a pedosexual. Okay. Rats. Hmm. You know,
1327680	1332400	I don't know about that one. Spider. Spiders. Yes. Yes. Obviously. And thankfully they include
1332400	1339200	these extra lines to write other things in. So for example, I want no. Trump. Because Trump is
1339200	1346960	the most horrible thing of all. Romance. Fade to black. Explicit between PCs and NPCs between PCs
1346960	1352960	and the same with sex. Well, you know what? I identify as an incel. So all of this triggers me
1352960	1357680	and I want no sex in my game whatsoever. Mental and physical health. Okay,
1357680	1361920	hold on a minute. Cancer, claustrophobia, freezing death, gaslighting, genocide, heat stroke,
1361920	1367120	natural disasters, paralysis or restraint, police, pregnancy, miscarriage or abortion,
1367120	1372480	self-harm, severe weather, sexual starvation, terrorism, torture, and thirst. Let's add to this
1373520	1379040	just harm. Okay. I don't want any harm of any kind in my vampire game.
1379040	1387280	And hopefully if I do not consent to any of these things, then what that means is that my character
1387280	1392400	will never take damage and never die. I think that's a good idea. There's no top topics just
1392400	1400880	because I am being triggered to all hell right now. I do not want any vampires in my vampire
1400880	1405840	game. All right. Because they trigger me. They're just something about them. They're kind of creepy,
1405840	1412880	you know? So there we go. We are now playing the perfect Vampire the Masquerade game as the
1412880	1420560	developers of the game intended it to be played. Everything is safe. Everything is wholesome and
1420560	1426160	accepting and open and no one can feel triggered about anything. And you know what?
1426160	1428560	Everything's completely fine.
