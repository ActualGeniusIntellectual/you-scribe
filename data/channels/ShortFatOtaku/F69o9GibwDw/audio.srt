1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
You know, I've had this video in me for a while, and I'm actually pretty happy that

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,760
I decided to record it after yesterday's Vampire the Masquerade stream over on ArchWarhammer's

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,880
channel, which by the way, you should go watch if you haven't already. Arch is DMing, it's me,

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,760
Sargon, Rags, and Uzulu playing in a Vampire the Masquerade game. Oh, also Kyle's there too,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,440
he's a new guy. But we're playing Vampire the Masquerade, a tabletop game, we're playing it

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,880
online, and it's a lot of fun, it's called In the Claws of the Eagle. In any case, during one of

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,160
these streams, which by the way happen every Wednesday at 2.30pm EST, we were looking through

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,840
the Vampire the Masquerade rulebook, the most recent one, the one that we're using for the game,

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
and we found this passage, advice for considerate play. I'm not going to read it all because it's

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,080
huge, but here's a few choice quotes. One of the best things about role-playing is that you can

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,960
play someone different from yourself. No gender, ethnicity, sexual preference, disability, class,

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,480
or position in society is off limits, but remember that this freedom comes with a responsibility

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,680
to your fellow players. For instance, your table may include people who identify as trans, and

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,000
whether they plan to transition or not, they will probably not feel comfortable if you portray the

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,120
trans experience as a simple preference or a condition to be cured, or if you just assume

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,720
that all of their characters are also trans. Always respect your players' identities. Vampire

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,280
the Masquerade is not a fascist-friendly game. If you are a neo-nazi, alt-writer, or whatever it is

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,160
you're calling yourself nowadays, we urge you to put this book down and call someone who you trust

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,080
to talk about where you went wrong in your life. That said, Kindred culture is inherently monstrous.

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,480
Part of the political horror of Vampire the Masquerade is surviving in a culture that

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,560
worships the bad old ways. Large parts of Kindred society, especially the Camarilla and the Sabbat,

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,600
adhere to cults of tradition, ascribe to the idea of humiliating their enemies with overwhelming

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,560
wealth and force, and praise religious fundamentalism or even pre-modern ideas.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
Even so, it's pretty easy to steer the game away from totalitarian perspectives.

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,600
Emphasize the differences between individual vampires. Tell stories about infighting,

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,800
surprising kindness, and new ideas. Play as thin-bloods, katif, or anarchs.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Portray Kindred society in all of its malicious and fascist glory, but let the player characters

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,200
oppose the system. What if someone wants to play a fascist, though? Or the storyteller wants

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,480
fascist NPCs? There are plenty of those throughout the world of darkness. Monsters with pretty faces.

30
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,760
They can be a tragic villain, or a former friend who fell. They might be the Brugge neo-nazi,

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,960
the far-right Ventrue billionaire, or the semester eugenicist. Whatever face they present,

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,400
the player characters should be given the satisfaction of redeeming or destroying them

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,040
eventually. After all, the player characters are something unique and special,

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,720
something fascists cannot abide. Well, thankfully, in Arch's campaign,

35
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,200
we're all playing a bunch of Nazis fighting against Russian communists during World War II.

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,120
We're German soldiers on the Eastern Front who also happen to be vampires. And the campaign

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
is set largely outside of the influence of the Camarilla, because the Nazis have always had this

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
weird thing going on with the occult. You must remember Indiana Jones, right, where they go

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,400
looking for artifacts and stuff to try and help the war effort. We're kind of playing those type

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,240
of Nazis. So there's basically like a paranormal research unit that the player characters are

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,520
attached to, and it's honestly a lot of really goofy, schlocky fun. Like Sargon is literally

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,200
the villain from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rags is playing as a gangrel who can shapeshift into

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,880
a walrus. I'm playing as the obligatory 1000-year-old vampire loli. In whose lieu is

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,800
Jurgen Panzersen, which is just a Nazi retelling of Jordan Peterson. He even has a best-selling

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,240
book, 12 Rules for Reich. But my point is, Vampire the Masquerade, when it was originally conceived,

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,120
didn't used to be this. The point of the game, and in fact it even says it in the rule book

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,560
elsewhere, the point of the game is that there are no heroes in vampire society. At some point,

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,440
every single character you encounter has to take blood from somebody. And they might have these

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,880
societies or these traditions or these methods by which they hold themselves together, but deep

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,680
down they're all in some way monstrous. And in fact that's often the objection to running vampire

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,160
campaigns, is that there's no heroes. You can't play a heroic character. And this passage actually

52
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,160
talks about character archetypes that make complete sense in the vampire lore. The Brugge Neo-Nazi,

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
the far-right Ventrue billionaire. You don't need to know the specifics of those clans to

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,320
understand what kind of characters they are, and they actually make complete sense within the lore.

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,520
But because I guess everything is run by social justice nowadays, we need a page in the rule book

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,760
saying, yeah we might have put the stats in the book for some reason, but you shouldn't play as

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,360
this. Don't. Don't do it. The tabletop situation needs to be a friendly and open and welcoming

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,040
space. I mean, at least according to the BBC. No offense, but Dungeon and Dragons isn't just for

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,080
nerds anymore. Not just for a bunch of beardy boys in the basement. It's for everybody and anybody.

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,960
It's so social, the most social game you have to play in fact. All you need is a few friends and a

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,160
dungeon master or game master to kind of run the game and tell you your story. It's this wonderful

62
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
escapism from real life, like acting or writing, but you're doing it as a group. And it can be

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,840
really good for people with anxiety, socializing issues, mobility issues, to kind of play somebody

64
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,200
else and experiment with their personality. It's got its problems, like most games to be honest,

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,480
with diversity and inclusion, but there's groups out there working on it, there's teams out there

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,320
working on it, and like even the creators are working on it. Okay, okay, okay. I guess it's

67
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,480
friendly and opening and welcome to everyone unless you have a beard, all right? It's not

68
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,880
just Vampire that has this problem though, obviously. Call of Cthulhu shows we need to

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,720
move past H.P. Lovecraft once and for all. Aside from his history of racism, Lovecraft's ideas are

70
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,040
so saturated they're no longer interesting fodder for horror games. I think we're all set on

71
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,080
Lovecraft games for a while, though let me just say I'm not talking about Lovecraft's racism,

72
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,520
which let's be honest, is real bad. The dude was racist. Games really need to fall out of love with

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,640
Lovecraft. I'm not keen on mincing words on this one. H.P. Lovecraft was a racist. Cthulhu game

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,560
creators acknowledge that Lovecraft was a racist. And you know what? By modern standards, Lovecraft

75
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
probably was. I haven't looked into it, so I don't know if he is or not, but let's just assume that

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,480
by modern standards he is. You still can't hold him to those modern standards though, can you?

77
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,360
Because he didn't exist in modern society. He didn't live in modern culture. I mean, if you

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,400
can have cultural relativism for all of these backwards ass religions that come in and destroy

79
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,800
western civilization simply on the grounds of it's their culture, then surely you can have

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,160
temporal cultural relativism, right? I mean, why not? Here, if there actually happens to be any

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,920
kind of social justice-y tags listening to this, I'm gonna blow your mind right now, alright?

82
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,960
You cannot judge somebody for living up to your present ideals if they existed in the past,

83
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,640
and here's why. Political advancement is exactly like scientific advancement or technological

84
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,720
advancement. You have to think about things for a while and iterate on ideas. You have to discover

85
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
things and create things. You have to invent things. Believe it or not, there was once a

86
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,840
point in human history where every single person did not know that people of a different race from

87
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,560
them were also humans, and that's something that we had to figure out. And it's actually not fair

88
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,400
to judge people in the past who thought that way by modern standards. I mean, would you do it for

89
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,480
technology? Would you consider the medieval peasant to be morally deficient because he has

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,440
no idea what a computer is? Well, no, obviously not. Well, the same goes with political or

91
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,600
philosophical discoveries. It's easy for you to think of all the liberal norms we take for

92
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,680
granted today as being universal, but they're not universal. We had to discover that shit,

93
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,560
and yet here we are. While developing Fate of Cthulhu, we were obligated to reflect on the

94
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,960
problematic roots of the source material. We tackle that on page six. The mythos is definitely

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,560
worth exploring. It's also worth re-examining. Ah, yes, of course. Make money off of this extremely

96
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
profitable available IP, but also make sure to lecture to your audience about how problematic

97
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,280
the IP actually is and how bad it is that they want to enjoy it. All right, let's see what it

98
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,640
says. Fate of Cthulhu is a game that deals with many hard topics, including mental health,

99
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,320
systemic abuses of power, and the deaths of huge portions of the human species.

100
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,560
Make sure all the players are aware of these things and give enthusiastic consent before

101
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,080
they begin playing. Also, H.P. Lovecraft was a racist and anti-Semite. There, we said it.

102
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,160
You know, I don't buy a game, whether it's a video game or a tabletop game or whatever it is.

103
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,960
I don't plunk money down on this shit to be virtue signaled at and to be talked down to by

104
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,080
people who have no idea what they're actually saying. We are in a strange universe where the

105
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,520
radical left has gone so crazy that they've looped back around and basically become the new Jack

106
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,280
Chick. If some of you guys are too young to remember him, well, he made these really terrible

107
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,480
Christian comics talking about the dangers of Satanism and D&D. But today tabletop isn't

108
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,000
demonic. It's just problematic. As a quick side note, what's really funny is that in our

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,320
very obviously Nazi vampire game over on Archer's channel, we discovered all of this stuff in the

110
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,880
vampire rulebook weeks before it went viral, but it did go viral. It went viral a couple of days

111
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,360
ago. If you thought the fate of Cthulhu entry complaining about Lovecraft was cringe, I present

112
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,760
to you Vampire the Masquerade. No fascists. If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this

113
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,480
game. It's against the rules. If you're reading this and thinking you just call everyone you

114
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:20,560
disagree with a fascist, then you're probably a fascist. Oops, I guess we broke the rule.

115
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,640
I do hope our examination of these passages on stream a few weeks ago somehow contributed to

116
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,600
this going viral. Or maybe it's our stream itself because, you know, we generally get between 500

117
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,400
and 1000 people watching the Vampire the Masquerade sessions every week. And that actually

118
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,040
puts us in the realm of one of the more popular vampire streams on the entire internet. For

119
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,720
example, you've got Seattle by Night, which is a Vampire the Masquerade campaign run by Penny

120
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,920
Arcade. And Penny Arcade's a big deal. You know, they run PAX. They invented the idea of the modern

121
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,520
webcomic. They were one of the first real content creators on the internet. They run their Vampire

122
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,360
the Masquerade campaign on their Twitch channel. They get less viewers than us, both in terms of

123
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,840
live viewers and viewers after the fact. Their chat room, as you can probably see,

124
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,800
is a lot less rowdy, is a lot less engaged. It has a lot less activity. I don't want to knock

125
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,960
these guys because I actually remember reading Penny Arcade quite a bit back in the day when

126
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,120
they still had their edge. And PAX is certainly a success in its own right. But it seems like

127
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
the more popular option is a bunch of shitlords on the internet just playing it on Roll20. You've

128
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,200
also got Geek and Sundry's Vampire the Masquerade campaign. This is, if you don't know,

129
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,760
Felicia Day's channel, basically. I mean, it's not just her. There's a whole group of them, but it's

130
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,400
most well known for Felicia Day's involvement. And they have, you know, over 2 million subscribers,

131
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,640
half a million followers on Twitch. They have the official endorsement of World of Darkness,

132
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
you know, the people who create Vampire the Masquerade. And yet their campaign doesn't

133
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,280
really seem to be that much popular than ours. It is. Our streams tend to get between 10 and 20k

134
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,800
viewers after the fact. Theirs get between 80 and say 50 after the fact. So they're definitely more

135
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,120
popular than us, but not by a huge amount, despite having all of this backing. And I think it's

136
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,680
primarily because, you know, these guys and also the Penny Arcade guys, you know, they're playing

137
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,360
very tame campaigns. You know, they're quite afraid to be a little bit edgy, even though it's

138
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,560
literally a game about vampires being edgy. Like this is, if there was going to be a tabletop game

139
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,960
where edginess is the norm, it's supposed to be Vampire the Masquerade. By the way,

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,320
I discovered those games because of this Twitter account, Vancouver by Night. This is another

141
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,080
Vampire the Masquerade campaign apparently happening in Vancouver. It seems like a lot of

142
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,600
the campaigns just have like the name of their city and then by night. I think that's because

143
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,080
the official Vampire the Masquerade rulebook literally says, if you can't figure out a setting,

144
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,880
just set it in your hometown and just, you know, play, you know, just play places that,

145
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,480
you know, basically. And it's like, well, that's, I guess, but it's not really that fun.

146
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,240
This group says that they added games to the list and it's like, if there are any other games

147
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,120
represented that, you know, let me know. Hashtag Vammily. I applied our game to be on this list.

148
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,520
And they were just like, do you have a link to the Twitch? And shortly after this,

149
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,800
they stopped replying to me because I think they figured out exactly what kind of game we were

150
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,000
playing. Literally role playing as Nazis, you guys, literally. However, it was through this

151
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,040
list that I realized most people who play Vampire the Masquerade, especially online, they're,

152
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,160
they're social justice warriors themselves. And I don't mean just the big ones like Penny Arcade or

153
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,840
Felicia Day with Geek and Sundry. Ah, yes. The old chestnut of version five, not being a true

154
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,480
Vampire the Masquerade game because it doesn't cover bad things argument. Yes. One can play a

155
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,320
nasty piece of shit in their game. Does that mean we welcome actual fascists, racists and sexist

156
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,880
people? Fuck no. It's the whole Bruja being Nazis shit again. And no point in either text is said

157
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,280
that it's okay for these groups of people to exist in the real world, but it does acknowledge their

158
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,240
existence. If anything, I admire the writer's wording for actually mocking these scumbags.

159
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,480
The World of Darkness is more than the all nasty shit that end with ists. The World of Darkness is

160
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,040
the battle with oneself as a vampire coming to terms with your condition. It is not a game of

161
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,280
how to be offensive and insensitive. Of course, these things can be explored in the games if done

162
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,240
properly. They already exist to a very mild extent in the game's canon. But if you really think that

163
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,320
anything goes because it's the World of Darkness, piss off. We don't want you in our games.

164
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,280
All right, so vampires, no problem. Blood sucking creatures of the night. Okay.

165
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,720
Literally cursed by the devil and turned away from all that is good and holy in the world.

166
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,880
Completely fine. But don't you dare be a fucking racist. And this isn't me advocating for racism.

167
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,960
This is me advocating for common sense. It's me advocating for racism's rightful spot

168
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,760
in the hierarchy of evil things. So you want to put racism in your fantasy game.

169
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,920
A DM's guide to implementing real world racism analogies into fictional worlds

170
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,600
by white people. Me for white people. You all. Step one, don't. There's absolutely no reason for

171
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,880
it. Realism? Bullshit. There are elves and dragons and magic. Grittiness? There's plenty of other

172
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,240
stuff and tropes to use that don't perpetuate harmful like that. Harmful like that? Creating

173
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,960
conflict? Again, plenty of other options that don't rely on IRL racism. The only people who

174
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,760
should use themes like these in their games are the ones actually affected by it. As a trans

175
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,960
person, it can feel super fucking cathartic and awesome to combat and smash transphobic bullshit

176
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,640
in game. That's because we decide to handle the topic. On the other hand, when a cis person

177
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,520
decides to put transphobia in their game, or a white person with racism, they just end up

178
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,720
perpetuating the same harmful shittiness that we try to escape from when playing D&D. So if

179
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
you're a white DM, unless you have a person of color in your group and they specifically ask you

180
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,760
to put something like this in your game so they can handle it, don't. Okay, so by that logic,

181
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,960
since we've all been branded as alt-right neo-Nazis and we're playing original Nazis in

182
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,960
our campaign, it's fine, right? I mean, personally, as a Nazi person, it can feel super fucking

183
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,920
cathartic and awesome to combat and smash Russian communism bullshit in game. It's the same logic.

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,080
It's also, by the way, why the logic is stupid. You are not your character. You know, if you're

185
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,400
playing an orc barbarian in D&D, you're not actually an orc barbarian in real life.

186
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,960
If you're playing a racist character, you're not actually a racist in real life. I was never a fat

187
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,640
black monk, nor was I ever a loli vampire Nazi. Just because something is portrayed in a fictional

188
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,480
setting doesn't mean that the creator of the fictional setting actually exposes that ideology.

189
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,960
It's just a game. And I'll say it's just a game to you types in the same way that I would say it to

190
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,680
both Anita Sarkeesian and Jack Thompson when it comes to video games. It's just a fucking game.

191
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,960
By the way, for some people, Vampire the Masquerade didn't go far enough in its rebuke of Nazism.

192
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,880
If you aren't hiring experts, you'll end up with coded Nazi language and harmful messages in your

193
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,920
vammily Vampire the Masquerade games. Please, this isn't something you can just wing,

194
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
not with the status of our fandom. There's plenty of people with amazing qualifications that will

195
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,080
have a serious critical look at your creations and help you make sure your mechanics,

196
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,320
narratives, and systems aren't accidentally condoning Nazi ideals

197
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,600
or putting authoritarian regimes on a pedestal. You can't afford to act like a dude in a garage

198
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,360
doing a niche product. You're using a multi-million dollar worth IP that's known for having welcomed

199
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,200
Nazis because they're clients. You need to take active measures, else your neutrality will kill

200
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,840
us. I'm even going to need to add that your spoken messages and written credos in the vammily

201
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,400
need to be followed by actual action, especially when you don't apologize to victims of your

202
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,640
abuser staff. Your disclaimer means nothing if you still support them and promote them.

203
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,760
I must insist, Vampire the Masquerade and World of Darkness aren't a couple of dudes in a garage

204
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,000
anymore. You have a duty, as content creators, to educate yourself and not be a bigot, not doxxing

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,200
minors, have meaningful and well-designed representation, not put in pet play for shock

206
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,680
and edge value, be mature, but real maturity isn't that. Yes, your NPCs and your society is

207
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,360
a clusterfuck of leeches with all of the ism behaviors, but you need to show it as a problem,

208
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,520
not as something to glorify. I mean, the whole point is to play as somebody that you're not,

209
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,280
right? Like, I'm not Mario. I'm not Link. Whenever I play those games, I don't believe myself to be

210
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,920
them. You're taking on a role. It's a role-playing game. The whole point is that you take on a role

211
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,720
that you're not. I think the biggest problem I have with it, though, is that yes, Vampire

212
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,240
the Masquerade was meant to be like the edgy tabletop, you know, because Dungeons and Dragons

213
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
wasn't really that edgy. Maybe first edition was with all the crazy illustrations in the rule book,

214
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,320
but in general, Vampire the Masquerade was like, if you want to be an edgy teen goth shithead,

215
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
here's the game for you. It's all about being creatures of the night and having like inner

216
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,200
turmoil and drama and all this BS, but to suddenly turn around and say that you can no longer

217
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,600
be edgy in a property designed for edginess just seems to be counterproductive to me.

218
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,560
You know, if you were ever going to play ridiculous Nazi vampires, Vampire the Masquerade

219
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,280
would be the game to play it in. And then I'm reminded of the film genre Nazi-sploitation,

220
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,040
which I think peaked in the in the 70s or something. And the whole point of that genre of

221
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:36,160
film was that you would basically portray the Nazis in the most schlocky, hilarious and goofy,

222
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,480
but equally also insane and nightmarish fashion that you possibly could. It was equal parts

223
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,560
horror and hilarity. And you know, Vampire the Masquerade has a lot in common, tonally,

224
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,640
at least with Nazi-sploitation. Like if you were to go back and play the computer game that made

225
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,520
the series well known, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, you'll pretty quickly notice that

226
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,040
it is also full of some pretty goofy nonsense. It is a serious game with amazing music,

227
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,120
a tabletop accurate level up system and a really engaging story. But it also has quirky characters,

228
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,160
goofy side quests, and it's generally not afraid to make fun of itself. It does seem to be the

229
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,080
sense of humor that that marries Vampire the Masquerade and Nazi-sploitation so well together.

230
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,120
They're both internally very serious, but the real world people who engage with them often do so

231
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,000
just for fun. And half of the enjoyment comes from taking the piss out of it. But most importantly

232
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,240
of all, nobody thought that Nazi-sploitation portrayed the Nazis in a positive light.

233
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,280
And honestly, in my opinion, those movies are great. Not because they're like, they're actually

234
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,320
like Hitler's true vision of fascism or something, you know, far from it, but it's because it

235
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,720
basically parodies the Nazis and it turns them into a joke, which is fundamentally what they are.

236
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,360
And if you want to know how you combat Nazis, like the real neo-Nazis that do exist, a few of

237
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,920
them that are still kicking around nowadays, is you turn them into a joke. You laugh at them.

238
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,160
They don't hold political power anywhere. No one actually cares about their ideas.

239
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,840
They're a bunch of fucking losers. And bringing up like the great Nazi scare as if they're somehow

240
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,720
relevant, it seems like you're making them a bigger problem than they actually are.

241
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,920
And you know what? That gives them power. Especially if you take people who

242
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,120
make jokes about Nazis, like say, Dankula and his saluting pug, you take them and make them

243
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,640
fucking criminals for joking about it. Like whose honor are you defending when you do that?

244
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,960
When you say no fascists are allowed to play Vampire the Masquerade, you can't depict Nazis

245
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,240
in this game. You know, are you defending Hitler's honor? You know, do not be a liberal iconoclast

246
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,000
against the sacred Nazi cow. But you know what? It's completely okay because Arch had us all fill

247
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,720
out this handy dandy RPG consent form when we first started playing Vampire the Masquerade.

248
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
All right. And this thing, this thing is just great. You know, you can absolutely put in all

249
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,080
the things that trigger you. So you don't even have to be exposed to them. So you can go on

250
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,360
living in your hug box for the rest of your life. And you know, there's actually some really good

251
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,760
stuff here. All right. Let's look over it. Right. So for example, we have the GM name. That would be

252
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,880
Arch. That's him. The planned game theme would obviously be Nazis.

253
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,760
Nazi. Mark the color that best illustrate your comfort level with the following plot or story

254
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,480
elements. Green. Enthusiastic consent. Bring it on. Yellow. Okay if veiled or off stage.

255
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,720
Might be okay on stage, but requires discussion ahead of time. Uncertain. Red. Hard line. Do not

256
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,120
include. Okay. Well, let's let's go through this. All right. So horror. Bugs. They're kind of icky,

257
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,400
so no. All right. Blood. Well, it's a vampire game, I understand, but still no blood in this

258
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,680
game. All right. All right. Demons. Well, you know, after the new Doom trailer, I'm kind of

259
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,520
triggered by them. So no thanks. Eyeballs. No, I mean, absolutely not. I keep my eyes closed all

260
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,200
the time. Gore. No, of course not. Harm to animals. No, because I'm a vegan, obviously.

261
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:07,520
Harm to children. Yes, because I'm also a pedosexual. Okay. Rats. Hmm. You know,

262
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,400
I don't know about that one. Spider. Spiders. Yes. Yes. Obviously. And thankfully they include

263
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,200
these extra lines to write other things in. So for example, I want no. Trump. Because Trump is

264
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,960
the most horrible thing of all. Romance. Fade to black. Explicit between PCs and NPCs between PCs

265
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,960
and the same with sex. Well, you know what? I identify as an incel. So all of this triggers me

266
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,680
and I want no sex in my game whatsoever. Mental and physical health. Okay,

267
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,920
hold on a minute. Cancer, claustrophobia, freezing death, gaslighting, genocide, heat stroke,

268
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,120
natural disasters, paralysis or restraint, police, pregnancy, miscarriage or abortion,

269
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,480
self-harm, severe weather, sexual starvation, terrorism, torture, and thirst. Let's add to this

270
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,040
just harm. Okay. I don't want any harm of any kind in my vampire game.

271
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:07,280
And hopefully if I do not consent to any of these things, then what that means is that my character

272
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,400
will never take damage and never die. I think that's a good idea. There's no top topics just

273
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:20,880
because I am being triggered to all hell right now. I do not want any vampires in my vampire

274
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,840
game. All right. Because they trigger me. They're just something about them. They're kind of creepy,

275
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,880
you know? So there we go. We are now playing the perfect Vampire the Masquerade game as the

276
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,560
developers of the game intended it to be played. Everything is safe. Everything is wholesome and

277
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,160
accepting and open and no one can feel triggered about anything. And you know what?

278
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,560
Everything's completely fine.
