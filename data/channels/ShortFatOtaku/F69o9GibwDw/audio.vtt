WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
You know, I've had this video in me for a while, and I'm actually pretty happy that

00:04.560 --> 00:11.760
I decided to record it after yesterday's Vampire the Masquerade stream over on ArchWarhammer's

00:11.760 --> 00:16.880
channel, which by the way, you should go watch if you haven't already. Arch is DMing, it's me,

00:16.880 --> 00:23.760
Sargon, Rags, and Uzulu playing in a Vampire the Masquerade game. Oh, also Kyle's there too,

00:23.760 --> 00:27.440
he's a new guy. But we're playing Vampire the Masquerade, a tabletop game, we're playing it

00:27.440 --> 00:32.880
online, and it's a lot of fun, it's called In the Claws of the Eagle. In any case, during one of

00:32.880 --> 00:38.160
these streams, which by the way happen every Wednesday at 2.30pm EST, we were looking through

00:38.160 --> 00:41.840
the Vampire the Masquerade rulebook, the most recent one, the one that we're using for the game,

00:41.840 --> 00:46.640
and we found this passage, advice for considerate play. I'm not going to read it all because it's

00:46.640 --> 00:50.080
huge, but here's a few choice quotes. One of the best things about role-playing is that you can

00:50.080 --> 00:54.960
play someone different from yourself. No gender, ethnicity, sexual preference, disability, class,

00:54.960 --> 01:00.480
or position in society is off limits, but remember that this freedom comes with a responsibility

01:00.480 --> 01:05.680
to your fellow players. For instance, your table may include people who identify as trans, and

01:05.680 --> 01:10.000
whether they plan to transition or not, they will probably not feel comfortable if you portray the

01:10.000 --> 01:15.120
trans experience as a simple preference or a condition to be cured, or if you just assume

01:15.120 --> 01:20.720
that all of their characters are also trans. Always respect your players' identities. Vampire

01:20.720 --> 01:27.280
the Masquerade is not a fascist-friendly game. If you are a neo-nazi, alt-writer, or whatever it is

01:27.280 --> 01:32.160
you're calling yourself nowadays, we urge you to put this book down and call someone who you trust

01:32.160 --> 01:38.080
to talk about where you went wrong in your life. That said, Kindred culture is inherently monstrous.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.480
Part of the political horror of Vampire the Masquerade is surviving in a culture that

01:42.480 --> 01:48.560
worships the bad old ways. Large parts of Kindred society, especially the Camarilla and the Sabbat,

01:48.560 --> 01:53.600
adhere to cults of tradition, ascribe to the idea of humiliating their enemies with overwhelming

01:53.600 --> 01:58.560
wealth and force, and praise religious fundamentalism or even pre-modern ideas.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.960
Even so, it's pretty easy to steer the game away from totalitarian perspectives.

02:02.960 --> 02:07.600
Emphasize the differences between individual vampires. Tell stories about infighting,

02:07.600 --> 02:12.800
surprising kindness, and new ideas. Play as thin-bloods, katif, or anarchs.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.000
Portray Kindred society in all of its malicious and fascist glory, but let the player characters

02:18.000 --> 02:23.200
oppose the system. What if someone wants to play a fascist, though? Or the storyteller wants

02:23.200 --> 02:28.480
fascist NPCs? There are plenty of those throughout the world of darkness. Monsters with pretty faces.

02:28.480 --> 02:33.760
They can be a tragic villain, or a former friend who fell. They might be the Brugge neo-nazi,

02:33.760 --> 02:38.960
the far-right Ventrue billionaire, or the semester eugenicist. Whatever face they present,

02:38.960 --> 02:42.400
the player characters should be given the satisfaction of redeeming or destroying them

02:42.400 --> 02:47.040
eventually. After all, the player characters are something unique and special,

02:47.040 --> 02:50.720
something fascists cannot abide. Well, thankfully, in Arch's campaign,

02:50.720 --> 02:55.200
we're all playing a bunch of Nazis fighting against Russian communists during World War II.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.120
We're German soldiers on the Eastern Front who also happen to be vampires. And the campaign

02:59.120 --> 03:03.360
is set largely outside of the influence of the Camarilla, because the Nazis have always had this

03:03.360 --> 03:06.640
weird thing going on with the occult. You must remember Indiana Jones, right, where they go

03:06.640 --> 03:10.400
looking for artifacts and stuff to try and help the war effort. We're kind of playing those type

03:10.400 --> 03:16.240
of Nazis. So there's basically like a paranormal research unit that the player characters are

03:16.240 --> 03:21.520
attached to, and it's honestly a lot of really goofy, schlocky fun. Like Sargon is literally

03:21.520 --> 03:27.200
the villain from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rags is playing as a gangrel who can shapeshift into

03:27.200 --> 03:32.880
a walrus. I'm playing as the obligatory 1000-year-old vampire loli. In whose lieu is

03:32.880 --> 03:38.800
Jurgen Panzersen, which is just a Nazi retelling of Jordan Peterson. He even has a best-selling

03:38.800 --> 03:44.240
book, 12 Rules for Reich. But my point is, Vampire the Masquerade, when it was originally conceived,

03:44.240 --> 03:49.120
didn't used to be this. The point of the game, and in fact it even says it in the rule book

03:49.120 --> 03:54.560
elsewhere, the point of the game is that there are no heroes in vampire society. At some point,

03:54.560 --> 03:59.440
every single character you encounter has to take blood from somebody. And they might have these

03:59.440 --> 04:04.880
societies or these traditions or these methods by which they hold themselves together, but deep

04:04.880 --> 04:09.680
down they're all in some way monstrous. And in fact that's often the objection to running vampire

04:09.680 --> 04:14.160
campaigns, is that there's no heroes. You can't play a heroic character. And this passage actually

04:14.160 --> 04:20.160
talks about character archetypes that make complete sense in the vampire lore. The Brugge Neo-Nazi,

04:20.160 --> 04:24.400
the far-right Ventrue billionaire. You don't need to know the specifics of those clans to

04:24.400 --> 04:28.320
understand what kind of characters they are, and they actually make complete sense within the lore.

04:28.320 --> 04:33.520
But because I guess everything is run by social justice nowadays, we need a page in the rule book

04:33.520 --> 04:37.760
saying, yeah we might have put the stats in the book for some reason, but you shouldn't play as

04:37.760 --> 04:43.360
this. Don't. Don't do it. The tabletop situation needs to be a friendly and open and welcoming

04:43.360 --> 04:49.040
space. I mean, at least according to the BBC. No offense, but Dungeon and Dragons isn't just for

04:49.040 --> 04:54.080
nerds anymore. Not just for a bunch of beardy boys in the basement. It's for everybody and anybody.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.960
It's so social, the most social game you have to play in fact. All you need is a few friends and a

04:58.960 --> 05:04.160
dungeon master or game master to kind of run the game and tell you your story. It's this wonderful

05:04.160 --> 05:08.560
escapism from real life, like acting or writing, but you're doing it as a group. And it can be

05:08.560 --> 05:13.840
really good for people with anxiety, socializing issues, mobility issues, to kind of play somebody

05:13.840 --> 05:19.200
else and experiment with their personality. It's got its problems, like most games to be honest,

05:19.200 --> 05:24.480
with diversity and inclusion, but there's groups out there working on it, there's teams out there

05:24.480 --> 05:28.320
working on it, and like even the creators are working on it. Okay, okay, okay. I guess it's

05:28.320 --> 05:32.480
friendly and opening and welcome to everyone unless you have a beard, all right? It's not

05:32.480 --> 05:36.880
just Vampire that has this problem though, obviously. Call of Cthulhu shows we need to

05:36.880 --> 05:42.720
move past H.P. Lovecraft once and for all. Aside from his history of racism, Lovecraft's ideas are

05:42.720 --> 05:47.040
so saturated they're no longer interesting fodder for horror games. I think we're all set on

05:47.040 --> 05:52.080
Lovecraft games for a while, though let me just say I'm not talking about Lovecraft's racism,

05:52.080 --> 05:57.520
which let's be honest, is real bad. The dude was racist. Games really need to fall out of love with

05:57.520 --> 06:02.640
Lovecraft. I'm not keen on mincing words on this one. H.P. Lovecraft was a racist. Cthulhu game

06:02.640 --> 06:08.560
creators acknowledge that Lovecraft was a racist. And you know what? By modern standards, Lovecraft

06:08.560 --> 06:12.080
probably was. I haven't looked into it, so I don't know if he is or not, but let's just assume that

06:12.080 --> 06:16.480
by modern standards he is. You still can't hold him to those modern standards though, can you?

06:16.480 --> 06:21.360
Because he didn't exist in modern society. He didn't live in modern culture. I mean, if you

06:21.360 --> 06:26.400
can have cultural relativism for all of these backwards ass religions that come in and destroy

06:26.400 --> 06:30.800
western civilization simply on the grounds of it's their culture, then surely you can have

06:30.800 --> 06:36.160
temporal cultural relativism, right? I mean, why not? Here, if there actually happens to be any

06:36.160 --> 06:39.920
kind of social justice-y tags listening to this, I'm gonna blow your mind right now, alright?

06:39.920 --> 06:44.960
You cannot judge somebody for living up to your present ideals if they existed in the past,

06:44.960 --> 06:50.640
and here's why. Political advancement is exactly like scientific advancement or technological

06:50.640 --> 06:56.720
advancement. You have to think about things for a while and iterate on ideas. You have to discover

06:56.720 --> 07:00.400
things and create things. You have to invent things. Believe it or not, there was once a

07:00.400 --> 07:05.840
point in human history where every single person did not know that people of a different race from

07:05.840 --> 07:10.560
them were also humans, and that's something that we had to figure out. And it's actually not fair

07:10.560 --> 07:14.400
to judge people in the past who thought that way by modern standards. I mean, would you do it for

07:14.400 --> 07:18.480
technology? Would you consider the medieval peasant to be morally deficient because he has

07:18.480 --> 07:23.440
no idea what a computer is? Well, no, obviously not. Well, the same goes with political or

07:23.440 --> 07:27.600
philosophical discoveries. It's easy for you to think of all the liberal norms we take for

07:27.600 --> 07:31.680
granted today as being universal, but they're not universal. We had to discover that shit,

07:31.680 --> 07:36.560
and yet here we are. While developing Fate of Cthulhu, we were obligated to reflect on the

07:36.560 --> 07:40.960
problematic roots of the source material. We tackle that on page six. The mythos is definitely

07:40.960 --> 07:46.560
worth exploring. It's also worth re-examining. Ah, yes, of course. Make money off of this extremely

07:46.560 --> 07:51.120
profitable available IP, but also make sure to lecture to your audience about how problematic

07:51.120 --> 07:55.280
the IP actually is and how bad it is that they want to enjoy it. All right, let's see what it

07:55.280 --> 08:00.640
says. Fate of Cthulhu is a game that deals with many hard topics, including mental health,

08:00.640 --> 08:04.320
systemic abuses of power, and the deaths of huge portions of the human species.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.560
Make sure all the players are aware of these things and give enthusiastic consent before

08:08.560 --> 08:14.080
they begin playing. Also, H.P. Lovecraft was a racist and anti-Semite. There, we said it.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.160
You know, I don't buy a game, whether it's a video game or a tabletop game or whatever it is.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.960
I don't plunk money down on this shit to be virtue signaled at and to be talked down to by

08:22.960 --> 08:28.080
people who have no idea what they're actually saying. We are in a strange universe where the

08:28.080 --> 08:33.520
radical left has gone so crazy that they've looped back around and basically become the new Jack

08:33.520 --> 08:37.280
Chick. If some of you guys are too young to remember him, well, he made these really terrible

08:37.280 --> 08:42.480
Christian comics talking about the dangers of Satanism and D&D. But today tabletop isn't

08:42.480 --> 08:48.000
demonic. It's just problematic. As a quick side note, what's really funny is that in our

08:48.000 --> 08:54.320
very obviously Nazi vampire game over on Archer's channel, we discovered all of this stuff in the

08:54.320 --> 08:58.880
vampire rulebook weeks before it went viral, but it did go viral. It went viral a couple of days

08:58.880 --> 09:03.360
ago. If you thought the fate of Cthulhu entry complaining about Lovecraft was cringe, I present

09:03.360 --> 09:07.760
to you Vampire the Masquerade. No fascists. If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this

09:07.760 --> 09:12.480
game. It's against the rules. If you're reading this and thinking you just call everyone you

09:12.480 --> 09:20.560
disagree with a fascist, then you're probably a fascist. Oops, I guess we broke the rule.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.640
I do hope our examination of these passages on stream a few weeks ago somehow contributed to

09:24.640 --> 09:29.600
this going viral. Or maybe it's our stream itself because, you know, we generally get between 500

09:29.600 --> 09:34.400
and 1000 people watching the Vampire the Masquerade sessions every week. And that actually

09:34.400 --> 09:39.040
puts us in the realm of one of the more popular vampire streams on the entire internet. For

09:39.040 --> 09:44.720
example, you've got Seattle by Night, which is a Vampire the Masquerade campaign run by Penny

09:44.720 --> 09:49.920
Arcade. And Penny Arcade's a big deal. You know, they run PAX. They invented the idea of the modern

09:49.920 --> 09:55.520
webcomic. They were one of the first real content creators on the internet. They run their Vampire

09:55.520 --> 09:59.360
the Masquerade campaign on their Twitch channel. They get less viewers than us, both in terms of

09:59.360 --> 10:03.840
live viewers and viewers after the fact. Their chat room, as you can probably see,

10:03.840 --> 10:08.800
is a lot less rowdy, is a lot less engaged. It has a lot less activity. I don't want to knock

10:08.800 --> 10:12.960
these guys because I actually remember reading Penny Arcade quite a bit back in the day when

10:12.960 --> 10:19.120
they still had their edge. And PAX is certainly a success in its own right. But it seems like

10:19.120 --> 10:24.000
the more popular option is a bunch of shitlords on the internet just playing it on Roll20. You've

10:24.000 --> 10:29.200
also got Geek and Sundry's Vampire the Masquerade campaign. This is, if you don't know,

10:29.200 --> 10:33.760
Felicia Day's channel, basically. I mean, it's not just her. There's a whole group of them, but it's

10:33.760 --> 10:40.400
most well known for Felicia Day's involvement. And they have, you know, over 2 million subscribers,

10:40.400 --> 10:44.640
half a million followers on Twitch. They have the official endorsement of World of Darkness,

10:44.640 --> 10:48.720
you know, the people who create Vampire the Masquerade. And yet their campaign doesn't

10:48.720 --> 10:55.280
really seem to be that much popular than ours. It is. Our streams tend to get between 10 and 20k

10:55.280 --> 11:02.800
viewers after the fact. Theirs get between 80 and say 50 after the fact. So they're definitely more

11:02.800 --> 11:09.120
popular than us, but not by a huge amount, despite having all of this backing. And I think it's

11:09.120 --> 11:13.680
primarily because, you know, these guys and also the Penny Arcade guys, you know, they're playing

11:13.680 --> 11:19.360
very tame campaigns. You know, they're quite afraid to be a little bit edgy, even though it's

11:20.160 --> 11:26.560
literally a game about vampires being edgy. Like this is, if there was going to be a tabletop game

11:26.560 --> 11:30.960
where edginess is the norm, it's supposed to be Vampire the Masquerade. By the way,

11:30.960 --> 11:36.320
I discovered those games because of this Twitter account, Vancouver by Night. This is another

11:36.320 --> 11:40.080
Vampire the Masquerade campaign apparently happening in Vancouver. It seems like a lot of

11:40.080 --> 11:45.600
the campaigns just have like the name of their city and then by night. I think that's because

11:45.600 --> 11:50.080
the official Vampire the Masquerade rulebook literally says, if you can't figure out a setting,

11:50.080 --> 11:54.880
just set it in your hometown and just, you know, play, you know, just play places that,

11:54.880 --> 11:58.480
you know, basically. And it's like, well, that's, I guess, but it's not really that fun.

11:58.480 --> 12:02.240
This group says that they added games to the list and it's like, if there are any other games

12:02.240 --> 12:09.120
represented that, you know, let me know. Hashtag Vammily. I applied our game to be on this list.

12:09.120 --> 12:13.520
And they were just like, do you have a link to the Twitch? And shortly after this,

12:13.520 --> 12:18.800
they stopped replying to me because I think they figured out exactly what kind of game we were

12:18.800 --> 12:26.000
playing. Literally role playing as Nazis, you guys, literally. However, it was through this

12:26.000 --> 12:31.040
list that I realized most people who play Vampire the Masquerade, especially online, they're,

12:31.040 --> 12:36.160
they're social justice warriors themselves. And I don't mean just the big ones like Penny Arcade or

12:36.160 --> 12:41.840
Felicia Day with Geek and Sundry. Ah, yes. The old chestnut of version five, not being a true

12:41.840 --> 12:46.480
Vampire the Masquerade game because it doesn't cover bad things argument. Yes. One can play a

12:46.480 --> 12:52.320
nasty piece of shit in their game. Does that mean we welcome actual fascists, racists and sexist

12:52.320 --> 12:58.880
people? Fuck no. It's the whole Bruja being Nazis shit again. And no point in either text is said

12:58.880 --> 13:03.280
that it's okay for these groups of people to exist in the real world, but it does acknowledge their

13:03.280 --> 13:08.240
existence. If anything, I admire the writer's wording for actually mocking these scumbags.

13:08.240 --> 13:14.480
The World of Darkness is more than the all nasty shit that end with ists. The World of Darkness is

13:14.480 --> 13:19.040
the battle with oneself as a vampire coming to terms with your condition. It is not a game of

13:19.040 --> 13:25.280
how to be offensive and insensitive. Of course, these things can be explored in the games if done

13:25.280 --> 13:30.240
properly. They already exist to a very mild extent in the game's canon. But if you really think that

13:30.240 --> 13:34.320
anything goes because it's the World of Darkness, piss off. We don't want you in our games.

13:34.320 --> 13:39.280
All right, so vampires, no problem. Blood sucking creatures of the night. Okay.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.720
Literally cursed by the devil and turned away from all that is good and holy in the world.

13:45.280 --> 13:52.880
Completely fine. But don't you dare be a fucking racist. And this isn't me advocating for racism.

13:52.880 --> 13:58.960
This is me advocating for common sense. It's me advocating for racism's rightful spot

13:58.960 --> 14:03.760
in the hierarchy of evil things. So you want to put racism in your fantasy game.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.920
A DM's guide to implementing real world racism analogies into fictional worlds

14:07.920 --> 14:13.600
by white people. Me for white people. You all. Step one, don't. There's absolutely no reason for

14:13.600 --> 14:18.880
it. Realism? Bullshit. There are elves and dragons and magic. Grittiness? There's plenty of other

14:18.880 --> 14:24.240
stuff and tropes to use that don't perpetuate harmful like that. Harmful like that? Creating

14:24.240 --> 14:28.960
conflict? Again, plenty of other options that don't rely on IRL racism. The only people who

14:28.960 --> 14:33.760
should use themes like these in their games are the ones actually affected by it. As a trans

14:33.760 --> 14:38.960
person, it can feel super fucking cathartic and awesome to combat and smash transphobic bullshit

14:38.960 --> 14:44.640
in game. That's because we decide to handle the topic. On the other hand, when a cis person

14:44.640 --> 14:49.520
decides to put transphobia in their game, or a white person with racism, they just end up

14:49.520 --> 14:54.720
perpetuating the same harmful shittiness that we try to escape from when playing D&D. So if

14:54.720 --> 14:58.800
you're a white DM, unless you have a person of color in your group and they specifically ask you

14:58.800 --> 15:03.760
to put something like this in your game so they can handle it, don't. Okay, so by that logic,

15:03.760 --> 15:08.960
since we've all been branded as alt-right neo-Nazis and we're playing original Nazis in

15:08.960 --> 15:14.960
our campaign, it's fine, right? I mean, personally, as a Nazi person, it can feel super fucking

15:14.960 --> 15:21.920
cathartic and awesome to combat and smash Russian communism bullshit in game. It's the same logic.

15:22.800 --> 15:28.080
It's also, by the way, why the logic is stupid. You are not your character. You know, if you're

15:28.080 --> 15:32.400
playing an orc barbarian in D&D, you're not actually an orc barbarian in real life.

15:33.600 --> 15:38.960
If you're playing a racist character, you're not actually a racist in real life. I was never a fat

15:38.960 --> 15:44.640
black monk, nor was I ever a loli vampire Nazi. Just because something is portrayed in a fictional

15:44.640 --> 15:50.480
setting doesn't mean that the creator of the fictional setting actually exposes that ideology.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.960
It's just a game. And I'll say it's just a game to you types in the same way that I would say it to

15:54.960 --> 15:59.680
both Anita Sarkeesian and Jack Thompson when it comes to video games. It's just a fucking game.

15:59.680 --> 16:06.960
By the way, for some people, Vampire the Masquerade didn't go far enough in its rebuke of Nazism.

16:07.520 --> 16:12.880
If you aren't hiring experts, you'll end up with coded Nazi language and harmful messages in your

16:12.880 --> 16:17.920
vammily Vampire the Masquerade games. Please, this isn't something you can just wing,

16:17.920 --> 16:21.920
not with the status of our fandom. There's plenty of people with amazing qualifications that will

16:21.920 --> 16:26.080
have a serious critical look at your creations and help you make sure your mechanics,

16:26.080 --> 16:30.320
narratives, and systems aren't accidentally condoning Nazi ideals

16:30.320 --> 16:35.600
or putting authoritarian regimes on a pedestal. You can't afford to act like a dude in a garage

16:35.600 --> 16:41.360
doing a niche product. You're using a multi-million dollar worth IP that's known for having welcomed

16:41.360 --> 16:47.200
Nazis because they're clients. You need to take active measures, else your neutrality will kill

16:47.200 --> 16:51.840
us. I'm even going to need to add that your spoken messages and written credos in the vammily

16:51.840 --> 16:56.400
need to be followed by actual action, especially when you don't apologize to victims of your

16:56.400 --> 17:00.640
abuser staff. Your disclaimer means nothing if you still support them and promote them.

17:00.640 --> 17:05.760
I must insist, Vampire the Masquerade and World of Darkness aren't a couple of dudes in a garage

17:05.760 --> 17:12.000
anymore. You have a duty, as content creators, to educate yourself and not be a bigot, not doxxing

17:12.000 --> 17:17.200
minors, have meaningful and well-designed representation, not put in pet play for shock

17:17.200 --> 17:23.680
and edge value, be mature, but real maturity isn't that. Yes, your NPCs and your society is

17:23.680 --> 17:29.360
a clusterfuck of leeches with all of the ism behaviors, but you need to show it as a problem,

17:29.360 --> 17:33.520
not as something to glorify. I mean, the whole point is to play as somebody that you're not,

17:33.520 --> 17:39.280
right? Like, I'm not Mario. I'm not Link. Whenever I play those games, I don't believe myself to be

17:39.280 --> 17:43.920
them. You're taking on a role. It's a role-playing game. The whole point is that you take on a role

17:43.920 --> 17:48.720
that you're not. I think the biggest problem I have with it, though, is that yes, Vampire

17:48.720 --> 17:52.240
the Masquerade was meant to be like the edgy tabletop, you know, because Dungeons and Dragons

17:52.240 --> 17:56.960
wasn't really that edgy. Maybe first edition was with all the crazy illustrations in the rule book,

17:56.960 --> 18:02.320
but in general, Vampire the Masquerade was like, if you want to be an edgy teen goth shithead,

18:02.320 --> 18:06.320
here's the game for you. It's all about being creatures of the night and having like inner

18:06.320 --> 18:11.200
turmoil and drama and all this BS, but to suddenly turn around and say that you can no longer

18:11.200 --> 18:15.600
be edgy in a property designed for edginess just seems to be counterproductive to me.

18:15.600 --> 18:20.560
You know, if you were ever going to play ridiculous Nazi vampires, Vampire the Masquerade

18:20.560 --> 18:25.280
would be the game to play it in. And then I'm reminded of the film genre Nazi-sploitation,

18:25.280 --> 18:29.040
which I think peaked in the in the 70s or something. And the whole point of that genre of

18:29.040 --> 18:36.160
film was that you would basically portray the Nazis in the most schlocky, hilarious and goofy,

18:36.160 --> 18:42.480
but equally also insane and nightmarish fashion that you possibly could. It was equal parts

18:42.480 --> 18:48.560
horror and hilarity. And you know, Vampire the Masquerade has a lot in common, tonally,

18:48.560 --> 18:52.640
at least with Nazi-sploitation. Like if you were to go back and play the computer game that made

18:52.640 --> 18:57.520
the series well known, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, you'll pretty quickly notice that

18:57.520 --> 19:03.040
it is also full of some pretty goofy nonsense. It is a serious game with amazing music,

19:03.040 --> 19:09.120
a tabletop accurate level up system and a really engaging story. But it also has quirky characters,

19:09.120 --> 19:14.160
goofy side quests, and it's generally not afraid to make fun of itself. It does seem to be the

19:14.160 --> 19:20.080
sense of humor that that marries Vampire the Masquerade and Nazi-sploitation so well together.

19:20.080 --> 19:25.120
They're both internally very serious, but the real world people who engage with them often do so

19:25.120 --> 19:30.000
just for fun. And half of the enjoyment comes from taking the piss out of it. But most importantly

19:30.000 --> 19:36.240
of all, nobody thought that Nazi-sploitation portrayed the Nazis in a positive light.

19:36.240 --> 19:41.280
And honestly, in my opinion, those movies are great. Not because they're like, they're actually

19:41.280 --> 19:46.320
like Hitler's true vision of fascism or something, you know, far from it, but it's because it

19:46.320 --> 19:52.720
basically parodies the Nazis and it turns them into a joke, which is fundamentally what they are.

19:52.720 --> 19:57.360
And if you want to know how you combat Nazis, like the real neo-Nazis that do exist, a few of

19:57.360 --> 20:01.920
them that are still kicking around nowadays, is you turn them into a joke. You laugh at them.

20:01.920 --> 20:06.160
They don't hold political power anywhere. No one actually cares about their ideas.

20:06.160 --> 20:11.840
They're a bunch of fucking losers. And bringing up like the great Nazi scare as if they're somehow

20:11.840 --> 20:14.720
relevant, it seems like you're making them a bigger problem than they actually are.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.920
And you know what? That gives them power. Especially if you take people who

20:19.920 --> 20:25.120
make jokes about Nazis, like say, Dankula and his saluting pug, you take them and make them

20:25.120 --> 20:30.640
fucking criminals for joking about it. Like whose honor are you defending when you do that?

20:30.640 --> 20:34.960
When you say no fascists are allowed to play Vampire the Masquerade, you can't depict Nazis

20:34.960 --> 20:40.240
in this game. You know, are you defending Hitler's honor? You know, do not be a liberal iconoclast

20:40.240 --> 20:46.000
against the sacred Nazi cow. But you know what? It's completely okay because Arch had us all fill

20:46.000 --> 20:52.720
out this handy dandy RPG consent form when we first started playing Vampire the Masquerade.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.720
All right. And this thing, this thing is just great. You know, you can absolutely put in all

20:56.720 --> 21:00.080
the things that trigger you. So you don't even have to be exposed to them. So you can go on

21:00.080 --> 21:03.360
living in your hug box for the rest of your life. And you know, there's actually some really good

21:03.360 --> 21:07.760
stuff here. All right. Let's look over it. Right. So for example, we have the GM name. That would be

21:08.720 --> 21:12.880
Arch. That's him. The planned game theme would obviously be Nazis.

21:12.880 --> 21:19.760
Nazi. Mark the color that best illustrate your comfort level with the following plot or story

21:19.760 --> 21:26.480
elements. Green. Enthusiastic consent. Bring it on. Yellow. Okay if veiled or off stage.

21:26.480 --> 21:32.720
Might be okay on stage, but requires discussion ahead of time. Uncertain. Red. Hard line. Do not

21:32.720 --> 21:39.120
include. Okay. Well, let's let's go through this. All right. So horror. Bugs. They're kind of icky,

21:39.120 --> 21:44.400
so no. All right. Blood. Well, it's a vampire game, I understand, but still no blood in this

21:44.400 --> 21:49.680
game. All right. All right. Demons. Well, you know, after the new Doom trailer, I'm kind of

21:49.680 --> 21:53.520
triggered by them. So no thanks. Eyeballs. No, I mean, absolutely not. I keep my eyes closed all

21:53.520 --> 21:59.200
the time. Gore. No, of course not. Harm to animals. No, because I'm a vegan, obviously.

21:59.200 --> 22:07.520
Harm to children. Yes, because I'm also a pedosexual. Okay. Rats. Hmm. You know,

22:07.680 --> 22:12.400
I don't know about that one. Spider. Spiders. Yes. Yes. Obviously. And thankfully they include

22:12.400 --> 22:19.200
these extra lines to write other things in. So for example, I want no. Trump. Because Trump is

22:19.200 --> 22:26.960
the most horrible thing of all. Romance. Fade to black. Explicit between PCs and NPCs between PCs

22:26.960 --> 22:32.960
and the same with sex. Well, you know what? I identify as an incel. So all of this triggers me

22:32.960 --> 22:37.680
and I want no sex in my game whatsoever. Mental and physical health. Okay,

22:37.680 --> 22:41.920
hold on a minute. Cancer, claustrophobia, freezing death, gaslighting, genocide, heat stroke,

22:41.920 --> 22:47.120
natural disasters, paralysis or restraint, police, pregnancy, miscarriage or abortion,

22:47.120 --> 22:52.480
self-harm, severe weather, sexual starvation, terrorism, torture, and thirst. Let's add to this

22:53.520 --> 22:59.040
just harm. Okay. I don't want any harm of any kind in my vampire game.

22:59.040 --> 23:07.280
And hopefully if I do not consent to any of these things, then what that means is that my character

23:07.280 --> 23:12.400
will never take damage and never die. I think that's a good idea. There's no top topics just

23:12.400 --> 23:20.880
because I am being triggered to all hell right now. I do not want any vampires in my vampire

23:20.880 --> 23:25.840
game. All right. Because they trigger me. They're just something about them. They're kind of creepy,

23:25.840 --> 23:32.880
you know? So there we go. We are now playing the perfect Vampire the Masquerade game as the

23:32.880 --> 23:40.560
developers of the game intended it to be played. Everything is safe. Everything is wholesome and

23:40.560 --> 23:46.160
accepting and open and no one can feel triggered about anything. And you know what?

23:46.160 --> 23:48.560
Everything's completely fine.
