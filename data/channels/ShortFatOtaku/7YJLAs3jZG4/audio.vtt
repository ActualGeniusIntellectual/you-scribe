00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Welcome to coronavirus land guys, I figure that I'll be doing coronavirus stuff from

00:04.400 --> 00:07.760
now until this thing blows over, if it ever does.

00:07.760 --> 00:14.980
Current totals are at 94,250 confirmed, that probably means we're at like 250,000 or something

00:14.980 --> 00:16.520
unconfirmed.

00:16.520 --> 00:21.600
Total deaths is at 3,214, total recovered is at 51,038.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.640
So yeah, by the stats, this is more deadly than SARS, this is more deadly than the various

00:26.640 --> 00:30.020
other outbreaks we've had in the past 20 years or so, but this definitely does seem

00:30.020 --> 00:32.600
to be the big one, or at least this century's big one.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.120
But at the same time, considering these numbers, you're likely not to die if you actually

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
catch this.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.520
And let's be clear, you will catch this.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.680
This thing's incubation period is so ridiculously long, I could have it right now and I don't

00:42.680 --> 00:43.680
even know.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.920
So you will probably get it and you will probably be fine, there's no reason to panic.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.880
But yeah, there's almost no point even going over what countries have it now because it

00:49.880 --> 00:52.940
just keeps popping up everywhere, there's a new case in a bunch of these other countries

00:52.940 --> 00:56.000
that used to not have it, it'll go everywhere eventually I think.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.400
A viewer of mine, Ranger Aqua, passed on this flyer that was put up at his local Costco,

01:02.400 --> 01:05.440
and apparently these are being put up at a lot of Costcos everywhere.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.440
We are currently sold out of the following items.

01:07.440 --> 01:12.720
All brands of toilet paper, Arrowhead Water, Glaxo, Glaco, whatever, Smart Water, all Kirkland

01:12.720 --> 01:16.880
Signature Water, Kirkland Signature Paper Towels, Kirkland Signature Surface Wipes,

01:16.880 --> 01:22.720
Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, Clorox Bleach, Clorox Cleanup, Hand Sanitizer, Lysol Disinfecting

01:22.720 --> 01:27.400
spray, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, all canned vegetables, Cup of Noodles, Canned Chicken

01:27.400 --> 01:32.120
Noodle Soup, Baked Beans, all 25 pound bags of rice, and Spam.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.400
If you are currently living in an area where there's no shortages of anything, go out and

01:35.400 --> 01:37.000
get your stuff now, be prepared.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.920
If you are living in an area where there are shortages, then you should have listened to

01:39.920 --> 01:41.400
me a month ago and got your food.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.720
I'm personally stocked up with enough food to last like six months, so I'm good, and

01:45.720 --> 01:49.700
I hope you guys are smart enough to get yourself into a similar situation as me.

01:49.700 --> 01:54.620
There have been some rather stupid happenings though, for example, 38% of Americans was

01:54.620 --> 01:58.540
a trending phrase on Twitter, and it's because 38% of Americans thought that the Coronavirus

01:58.540 --> 02:00.260
came from Corona Beer.

02:00.260 --> 02:01.260
Good job guys.

02:01.260 --> 02:05.860
But other hashtags that started the trend are Trump virus, and Trump lies about the

02:05.860 --> 02:06.860
Coronavirus.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.420
I don't know how you could possibly blame this thing on Trump.

02:09.420 --> 02:14.340
Considering that this virus came from China, and the quarantine failed because of the ineptness

02:14.340 --> 02:18.220
of the Chinese Communist government, I don't know how you could possibly blame this on

02:18.220 --> 02:19.220
Trump.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.740
This is going to try.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.100
Let's call it the Trump virus.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.180
If you're feeling awful, you know who to blame.

02:24.180 --> 02:29.300
However, this is an opinion piece written by opinion columnist Gail Collins, which means

02:29.300 --> 02:31.380
that it's quite literally full of fluff.

02:31.380 --> 02:34.060
I don't get why these news outlets have opinion pieces.

02:34.060 --> 02:40.380
I go to you for news not to listen to off-brand Elizabeth Warren give me her take on the Coronavirus.

02:40.380 --> 02:44.900
Coronavirus has also caused the GDC, the Game Developers Conference, to be postponed.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.700
And apparently while it was happening back on February 28th, a whole bunch of indie game

02:48.700 --> 02:52.420
devs were stuck in the city with hotels they couldn't refund and nothing to do.

02:52.420 --> 02:56.820
Also, since they're on the subject of video games, Plague Inc. has been removed from the

02:56.820 --> 02:59.800
China App Store and Steam.

02:59.800 --> 03:04.020
The real-time strategy game has been taken down due to illegal content.

03:04.020 --> 03:07.180
It was in China for years before, it wasn't illegal then.

03:07.180 --> 03:13.420
Additionally, an Arkansas woman causes a courthouse evacuation by claiming she has Coronavirus.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.700
I'm surprised it wasn't a Florida woman.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.180
And boy, that is the face of regret, if there's ever been one.

03:19.180 --> 03:23.100
An Arkansas woman sent a courtroom into chaos by claiming she had come down with the Coronavirus

03:23.100 --> 03:25.540
and she is now facing criminal charges for it.

03:25.540 --> 03:29.400
She was brought to a local hospital where she tested negative for the virus.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.240
As far as we can tell, she lied about having Coronavirus.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.100
The episode led to more charges against her for filing a false report, obstructing governmental

03:36.100 --> 03:38.100
operations and contempt of court.

03:38.100 --> 03:43.020
You know, if you're already arrested for something and you're in court dealing with it, maybe

03:43.020 --> 03:45.380
you should just leave it there, you know.

03:45.380 --> 03:49.460
Most sleeping dogs lie, don't claim you have Coronavirus to get out of it.

03:49.460 --> 03:55.300
The West's medical apparatus seems to be creaking and groaning under the strain of Coronavirus.

03:55.300 --> 03:59.260
This is from the US Surgeon General, seriously people, stop buying masks.

03:59.260 --> 04:02.940
They're not effective in preventing general public from catching Coronavirus, but if healthcare

04:02.940 --> 04:06.700
providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them in our communities

04:06.700 --> 04:07.700
at risk.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.240
Now this is technically true.

04:09.240 --> 04:12.820
A mask won't prevent you from getting Coronavirus, it'll just prevent you from spreading it to

04:12.820 --> 04:13.820
other people.

04:13.820 --> 04:18.440
We are living in a timeline where the US medical apparatus is so poorly put together that you

04:18.440 --> 04:24.280
have the US Surgeon General asking people to not buy commercially available products

04:24.280 --> 04:27.380
because their doctors will have to go and stock up on their own.

04:27.380 --> 04:29.660
But it's just a flu, right?

04:29.660 --> 04:31.180
But there's more incompetence.

04:31.180 --> 04:39.340
The CDC refused to test first possible community transmitted Coronavirus case for days.

04:39.340 --> 04:43.660
In the UK, the NHS is struggling to cope with the volume of Coronavirus calls.

04:43.660 --> 04:48.040
Callers give up after failing to get a reply or waiting hours and even days for clinicians

04:48.040 --> 04:49.160
to call them back.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.620
The stock market's begun to collapse.

04:51.620 --> 04:55.480
Coronavirus crash wipes 5 trillion off of world stocks.

04:55.480 --> 04:59.060
These are highly uncertain times, no one really knows the answer and the markets are really

04:59.060 --> 05:00.060
panicking.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.660
It's not just stocks though, it's also productivity.

05:02.660 --> 05:07.040
Coronavirus could cost the global economy 1.1 trillion in lost income.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.600
The virus is already having a chilling effect as China factory closures continue to spread.

05:11.600 --> 05:16.580
The latest explosive epicenter is Iran for the Coronavirus, and this is a thread from

05:16.580 --> 05:20.100
somebody who seems to know some information about the area.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.100
Coronavirus epidemic in Iran has passed the crisis level.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.940
The country is imploding.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.500
Law and order is to disappear in the next few days.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.980
A number of government officials have already died and mass infection among hospital staff

05:30.980 --> 05:32.660
and police forces are reported.

05:32.660 --> 05:36.220
The regime hid the initial cases, since it was just before an election and they needed

05:36.220 --> 05:37.220
high turnout.

05:37.220 --> 05:40.540
Let's be honest guys, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump's doing the same thing here.

05:40.540 --> 05:44.480
Trump entirely runs on an economic platform, and if there's an economic downturn due to

05:44.480 --> 05:46.720
the Coronavirus it might backfire in his face.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720
2.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.480
Due to political need they didn't stop travel to China.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.480
3.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.760
The source seems to be clerical students from China arriving in Qom, which is the biggest

05:53.760 --> 05:54.760
epicenter.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.760
4.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.240
Iran didn't close the religious shrines.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.240
5.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.260
Instead of providing information on the gravity of the rest of the public, they played it

06:02.260 --> 06:05.600
down and resorted to the same tactic of rhetoric, we will fight and beat it.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
Now it has spread everywhere.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.680
This is an Iranian MP who got the virus and died.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.980
A well-known filmmaker in Iran, he's died.

06:11.980 --> 06:15.340
Number of graves are being dug seem to be related to the high casualty of corona in

06:15.340 --> 06:16.980
the province of Galan.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.740
Airline staff collapsing at the airport.

06:18.740 --> 06:22.920
This morgue ambulance was reported to have been abandoned after carrying a victim of

06:22.920 --> 06:23.920
coronavirus.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.820
They just abandoned it.

06:27.820 --> 06:28.820
Wow dude.

06:28.820 --> 06:29.820
6.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.740
A clinic in the south of Iran has been torched by angry locals after allegedly 10 corona

06:32.740 --> 06:34.300
patients were transferred to the center.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.060
They just burned it?

06:36.060 --> 06:40.280
Oh my fucking god dude.

06:40.280 --> 06:44.280
Yeah they just lit it up.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.200
Holy shit dude.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.840
Yeah that's smart.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.080
Burn the hospitals that are actually caring for the patients.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.720
You fucking idiots.

06:53.720 --> 06:58.800
And speaking of fucking idiots, Iranians are licking religious shrines in defiance of the

06:58.800 --> 07:01.880
coronavirus spread.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.680
Yeah.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.700
This has to be peak Darwin award at this point.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.700
I get it.

07:07.700 --> 07:08.700
It's a test of faith.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.820
It's like oh look I believe so much that my god will protect me.

07:11.820 --> 07:16.340
I will lick this religious shrine and I will not get the virus.

07:16.340 --> 07:18.920
You guys are all gonna fucking die oh my god.

07:18.920 --> 07:23.540
These pro-regime people are licking the shrines and encouraging people to visit them.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.900
Iran's authorities are endangering the lives of Iranians and the world.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.820
The shrine is considered a place for healing and those who are photographed licking the

07:30.820 --> 07:33.400
door say they don't care what happens.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.980
I can't believe this is the world in which I live.

07:35.980 --> 07:40.780
There have been some reports of Trump being a bit flippant about the virus saying oh yeah

07:40.780 --> 07:43.120
we got under control guys don't worry it's not a big deal.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.520
I don't think that he's being an idiot like that that some of those hashtags suggested.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.620
I think he's trying to downplay the coronavirus because he doesn't want to affect 2020.

07:51.620 --> 07:56.620
However in reply to that you get insanity like this leftist Denver councilwoman cheers

07:56.620 --> 08:00.740
the idea of infecting Trump rallies with the coronavirus.

08:00.740 --> 08:05.640
Denver city councilwoman was hit with calls to resign on Tuesday after she showed support

08:05.640 --> 08:10.960
for a tweet floating the idea of attending Make America Great Again rallies to infect

08:10.960 --> 08:13.020
Trump supporters with the coronavirus.

08:13.020 --> 08:19.480
She tweeted hashtag solidarity yes for the record if I do get the coronavirus I'm attending

08:19.480 --> 08:21.360
every mega rally I can.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.440
I really thought it was just a flu guys like isn't that what you've been saying?

08:24.440 --> 08:28.000
Isn't that what the left has been saying trying to downplay this as Sinophobia it's just a

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
flu?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.980
You're just being racist against Chinese people?

08:30.980 --> 08:35.100
Oh but as soon as you can become a living fucking bioweapon you're all over it right?

08:35.100 --> 08:39.180
I've never gotten the coronavirus and I've never gone to a Trump rally but if I get the

08:39.180 --> 08:40.900
first I'm doing the second.

08:40.900 --> 08:45.260
If I contracted coronavirus I would go out and try to attend every Trump rally possible.

08:45.260 --> 08:49.280
All I'm saying is if you do think you have coronavirus you should immediately attend

08:49.280 --> 08:52.380
a Trump rally to be briefed by the president on what to do.

08:52.380 --> 08:56.100
He is an expert on everything and I'm sure there will be at least a few prescribing doctors

08:56.100 --> 08:57.100
in the crowd.

08:57.100 --> 09:01.120
If I find out I have the coronavirus I'm going to attend every Trump rally I can till I fall

09:01.120 --> 09:02.120
over dead.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.360
Now I get it right it's jokes it's memes.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.920
I can see the black humor in it for sure but it is a little bit different when an elected

09:07.920 --> 09:10.200
official says they're going to do it.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.400
It's a bad time for the neoliberal shitheels over at the EU.

09:14.400 --> 09:18.120
Coronavirus nightmare could be the end for Europe's borderless dream.

09:18.120 --> 09:22.980
The crown jewel of the EU its network of open internal borders has been hit hard by the

09:22.980 --> 09:24.460
refugee crisis.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.400
The virus could deliver another blow.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.540
If you needed another reason as to why open borders just doesn't work here it is.

09:30.540 --> 09:33.500
Amazon's also told its employees to not do any traveling.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.520
And honestly this is probably a good idea because if you have like an Amazon packer

09:36.520 --> 09:41.380
who has the coronavirus and he's spreading it into every package that could be nightmarish.

09:41.380 --> 09:46.260
Toronto is getting an Asian food festival in response to coronavirus fears nope nope

09:46.260 --> 09:47.780
nope no thank you.

09:47.780 --> 09:50.540
No thank you man with bat apron I'm not interested.

09:50.540 --> 09:53.440
Oh yeah and there was this shit I almost forgot.

09:53.440 --> 09:58.020
Amazon's deputy health minister and I think also the V.P. as well tests positive as the

09:58.020 --> 10:00.900
coronavirus outbreak worsens.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.520
Check this out dude.

10:02.520 --> 10:08.020
So he's here and he's like off to the side talking about the coronavirus and how they've

10:08.020 --> 10:12.860
got it all under control and how things are OK and he starts sweating like a fountain

10:12.860 --> 10:20.700
on live TV and it turns out he has coronavirus holy shit.

10:20.700 --> 10:24.240
This is like this is the kind of thing that you see at the beginning of the zombie story

10:24.240 --> 10:25.920
before the outbreak happens.

10:25.920 --> 10:31.440
Same energy by the way guy who was quarantined and said he was fine can't stop coughing during

10:31.440 --> 10:35.720
his interview with Fox.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.480
Why would you share it with your dog.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.480
Why would you.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.540
Oh my fucking God.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.800
But forget Iran's vice president forget the pope.

10:42.800 --> 10:43.800
G.T.S.

10:43.800 --> 10:50.480
Vivian has caught and been killed by the coronavirus unfortunately GTS Vivian was a prominent artist

10:50.480 --> 10:53.900
in the giantess fetish community.

10:53.900 --> 10:58.260
And yes I'm sure there's a few jokes you can make here and maybe in the future but it's

10:58.260 --> 10:59.700
still a person who's dead.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.080
Italy's followed in Japan's footsteps and decided to close down all the schools.

11:03.080 --> 11:07.440
Meanwhile the World Health Organization has finally announced its official death rate

11:07.440 --> 11:10.700
for the coronavirus and it's at three point four percent.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.740
It's not a crazy amount.

11:11.740 --> 11:16.020
If you get it you have a 97 percent chance of surviving it but that's higher than SARS

11:16.020 --> 11:21.240
it's higher than the flu and it seems to actually disproportionately kill old people.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.760
So this might be the end of the boomer generation after all.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.240
We have to talk about China's involvement again though.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.540
This article here don't buy China's story.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.920
The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
OK fair enough.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.000
This is all stuff that we've heard before you know the what did it come from the wet

11:35.000 --> 11:37.400
market did it come from the bio lab.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.400
Who knows.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.160
However there's an interesting bit in here that we should probably talk about.

11:41.160 --> 11:46.580
Some Chinese researchers at the bio lab are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals

11:46.580 --> 11:51.540
to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them instead of properly

11:51.540 --> 11:55.300
disposing of infected animals by cremation as the law requires.

11:55.300 --> 12:00.200
They sell them on the side to make a little extra cash or in some cases a lot of extra

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
cash.

12:01.200 --> 12:06.460
One Beijing researcher now in jail made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats

12:06.460 --> 12:11.020
on the live animal market where they eventually wound up in someone's stomach.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.020
Here we go.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.080
That's probably where it came from.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.520
Someone sold out the Batman.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.600
And of course we all know that everyone the Americans the Chinese whoever they're all

12:18.600 --> 12:22.100
cooking the numbers to try and avoid a global economic depression.

12:22.100 --> 12:27.320
Leaked documents reveal coronavirus infections up to 52 times higher than reported figures

12:27.320 --> 12:29.040
in China's Shandong province.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.740
There is no way that Iran has 66 deaths with only a couple hundred cases.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.860
It's not possible at a death rate of 3 percent.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.920
This thing is everywhere for real.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.880
And now we have to get into the tin foil hat territory where this might be an actual

12:40.880 --> 12:42.660
super virus or something.

12:42.660 --> 12:47.200
Wuhan to quarantine all cured patients for 14 days after some of them tested positive

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
again.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.780
There is a chance that after you've been cured of this disease you still spread it

12:51.780 --> 12:54.080
around and that's just how it is.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.280
You become an asymptomatic carrier.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.280
It's entirely possible.

12:57.280 --> 13:03.360
The coronavirus is far more likely than SARS to bond to human cells due to HIV like mutation.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.900
Again you might just become an asymptomatic carrier after you get it spreading it to everyone.

13:06.900 --> 13:10.060
This might just be a thing that humanity now has to live with.

13:10.060 --> 13:13.140
Additionally, this new bitter research just came out.

13:13.140 --> 13:18.080
Researchers identify two coronavirus strains as the Chinese case's dwindle.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.900
Scientists in China studying the outbreak of the disease caused by the new coronavirus

13:21.900 --> 13:25.800
say they have found that two main strains of the virus are circulating in humans and

13:25.800 --> 13:26.800
causing infections.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.800
That's interesting.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.420
Maybe we are at the point where mutations have actually begun to happen and things are

13:30.420 --> 13:31.420
splitting off.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.660
I do recall that I think it was with Ebola or one of these diseases.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.900
It fundamentally wasn't humans that stopped it.

13:36.900 --> 13:41.140
Nature stopped itself because an asymptomatic variant evolved naturally and then started

13:41.140 --> 13:42.640
inoculating the population.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.100
The preliminary study found that a more aggressive strain of the new coronavirus associated with

13:47.100 --> 13:52.660
the outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70% of analyzed cases, while 30% were linked

13:52.660 --> 13:54.300
to a less aggressive type.

13:54.300 --> 13:59.300
The prevalence of the more aggressive virus type decreased after early January 2020.

13:59.300 --> 14:03.540
Now on the one hand this is from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and it quite literally

14:03.540 --> 14:08.660
could just be propaganda to try and calm the world down or make China look better or

14:08.660 --> 14:10.260
prevent an economic slump or something.

14:10.260 --> 14:13.380
On the other hand it might actually be a cause for legitimate hope.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.620
Maybe things aren't as bad as they seem sometimes.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.620
Who knows?

14:16.620 --> 14:18.340
We'll have to wait and see.

14:18.340 --> 14:21.060
As they say, further immediate studies are needed.

14:21.060 --> 14:26.660
And of course the ACE2 expression in kidney and testis may cause kidney and testis damage

14:26.660 --> 14:28.660
after the coronavirus infection.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.780
Now there's a lot to go through here.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.920
I'm definitely not a scientist and there's a lot of scientific talk here.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.780
But here's my basic layman's understanding of it.

14:36.780 --> 14:42.620
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a major receptor that mediates the entry of the coronavirus

14:42.620 --> 14:43.620
into human cells.

14:43.620 --> 14:47.620
This is an enzyme overwhelmingly found in Asian populations, which may mean that this

14:47.620 --> 14:50.680
virus is more infectious to Asians than other people.

14:50.680 --> 14:55.400
At the same time it causes kidney and testicle damage, which does partially corroborate the

14:55.400 --> 14:58.120
reports that this thing will make you infertile after you get it.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.160
This is all still up in the air, but it seems like it might be a nightmare disease.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.920
But if it is the case that this thing at least somewhat selects by race, or that it leaves

15:04.920 --> 15:08.960
lasting permanent damage after it's done with you, or that you can continue infecting people

15:08.960 --> 15:10.720
long after you've been cured of it.

15:10.720 --> 15:15.740
One of my mods in my Discord server, she theorized that this would actually cause a new form

15:15.740 --> 15:17.480
of discrimination to come about.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.320
Where people who have been infected with it, even though they suffered no ill effects,

15:21.320 --> 15:24.840
because they're spreading it around, they're going to be treated like a second-class citizen.

15:24.880 --> 15:29.920
Imagine an entire society full of Typhoid Marys and like, a very stratified class system.

15:29.920 --> 15:30.920
That might be our future.

15:30.920 --> 15:35.520
And of course, China being China, they're now forcing their workers back to work in

15:35.520 --> 15:37.120
order to avoid an economic collapse.

15:37.120 --> 15:41.120
Doesn't matter if you're sick, doesn't matter who else gets sick, get back to work.

15:41.120 --> 15:46.240
Meanwhile these Chinese people had their apartment block forcibly demolished by the government

15:46.240 --> 15:48.920
in the efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus.

15:48.920 --> 15:53.120
The land will be used for something else, and the people who live there, they're now

15:53.120 --> 15:54.120
simply homeless.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.920
Oh, and by the way, if you're in China driving around, this is how you'd be treated now.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.160
These are coronavirus checkpoints.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.960
In order to even travel now, you have to be scanned with a handheld thermometer, and then

16:04.960 --> 16:09.860
they have SWAT teams in hazmat suits ready to force you into quarantine if you even have

16:09.860 --> 16:10.360
a fever.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.360
Of course, this guy's a moron for taking off his face mask, and he did kind of deserve

16:21.480 --> 16:26.160
this at the end, but I understand him being pissed, like, Jesus, this is some draconian

16:26.160 --> 16:27.880
ass shit, dude.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.720
This really does look like it's out of a sci-fi movie, isn't it?

16:31.720 --> 16:33.120
Man.

16:33.120 --> 16:37.200
Now they're like spraying down the car and spraying down the- oh my god.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.760
Alright, that's all the coronavirus news I have for you today.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.480
Even in my city, things are starting to heat up.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.200
There have been some shortages of food.

16:44.200 --> 16:49.280
I went to the grocery store a couple days ago, and there was definitely a crowd in there.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.800
People are starting to notice.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.520
If you haven't done your supply stock up a month ago, like when I was saying to do

16:54.520 --> 16:56.940
it, it might be a lot harder to do it now.

16:56.940 --> 17:00.280
If you are still in a relatively quiet area, and you still happen to have the luxury of

17:00.280 --> 17:02.120
time, don't wait.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.560
Go out and get some extra food.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.680
And most importantly of all, don't panic.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.080
Even if you have coronavirus, don't panic.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.320
It's not likely to kill you.

17:09.320 --> 17:13.200
All of those long-term side effects are still unconfirmed, and to be honest, things will

17:13.200 --> 17:14.200
probably be just fine.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.640
I know the meme is LOL is just a flu, bro, but if you get it, and for some reason you're

17:18.640 --> 17:21.880
not going to the hospital, or they won't take you, or for some reason you're stuck

17:21.880 --> 17:25.080
on your own, then your best bet is to probably treat it like a flu.

17:25.080 --> 17:29.480
Rest up, stay in bed, take medication, eat some decent food, chicken soup, you know how

17:29.480 --> 17:30.480
to do it.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.240
Remember, I said chicken soup, not bat soup, alright?

17:33.240 --> 17:34.240
And you know what?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.240
You probably won't die.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.800
We're all probably going to make it.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.480
What kills people right now isn't the virus, it's panic, and you have to avoid that.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.440
Alright my friends, good luck out there.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
I love you.

17:43.440 --> 17:47.360
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.800
virus-themed porn is going viral.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.240
The internet's a wonderful place, isn't it?
