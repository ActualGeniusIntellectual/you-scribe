0	4400	Welcome to coronavirus land guys, I figure that I'll be doing coronavirus stuff from
4400	7760	now until this thing blows over, if it ever does.
7760	14980	Current totals are at 94,250 confirmed, that probably means we're at like 250,000 or something
14980	16520	unconfirmed.
16520	21600	Total deaths is at 3,214, total recovered is at 51,038.
21600	26640	So yeah, by the stats, this is more deadly than SARS, this is more deadly than the various
26640	30020	other outbreaks we've had in the past 20 years or so, but this definitely does seem
30020	32600	to be the big one, or at least this century's big one.
32600	36120	But at the same time, considering these numbers, you're likely not to die if you actually
36120	37120	catch this.
37120	38520	And let's be clear, you will catch this.
38520	42680	This thing's incubation period is so ridiculously long, I could have it right now and I don't
42680	43680	even know.
43680	46920	So you will probably get it and you will probably be fine, there's no reason to panic.
46920	49880	But yeah, there's almost no point even going over what countries have it now because it
49880	52940	just keeps popping up everywhere, there's a new case in a bunch of these other countries
52940	56000	that used to not have it, it'll go everywhere eventually I think.
56000	62400	A viewer of mine, Ranger Aqua, passed on this flyer that was put up at his local Costco,
62400	65440	and apparently these are being put up at a lot of Costcos everywhere.
65440	67440	We are currently sold out of the following items.
67440	72720	All brands of toilet paper, Arrowhead Water, Glaxo, Glaco, whatever, Smart Water, all Kirkland
72720	76880	Signature Water, Kirkland Signature Paper Towels, Kirkland Signature Surface Wipes,
76880	82720	Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, Clorox Bleach, Clorox Cleanup, Hand Sanitizer, Lysol Disinfecting
82720	87400	spray, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, all canned vegetables, Cup of Noodles, Canned Chicken
87400	92120	Noodle Soup, Baked Beans, all 25 pound bags of rice, and Spam.
92120	95400	If you are currently living in an area where there's no shortages of anything, go out and
95400	97000	get your stuff now, be prepared.
97000	99920	If you are living in an area where there are shortages, then you should have listened to
99920	101400	me a month ago and got your food.
101400	105720	I'm personally stocked up with enough food to last like six months, so I'm good, and
105720	109700	I hope you guys are smart enough to get yourself into a similar situation as me.
109700	114620	There have been some rather stupid happenings though, for example, 38% of Americans was
114620	118540	a trending phrase on Twitter, and it's because 38% of Americans thought that the Coronavirus
118540	120260	came from Corona Beer.
120260	121260	Good job guys.
121260	125860	But other hashtags that started the trend are Trump virus, and Trump lies about the
125860	126860	Coronavirus.
126860	129420	I don't know how you could possibly blame this thing on Trump.
129420	134340	Considering that this virus came from China, and the quarantine failed because of the ineptness
134340	138220	of the Chinese Communist government, I don't know how you could possibly blame this on
138220	139220	Trump.
139740	140740	This is going to try.
140740	142100	Let's call it the Trump virus.
142100	144180	If you're feeling awful, you know who to blame.
144180	149300	However, this is an opinion piece written by opinion columnist Gail Collins, which means
149300	151380	that it's quite literally full of fluff.
151380	154060	I don't get why these news outlets have opinion pieces.
154060	160380	I go to you for news not to listen to off-brand Elizabeth Warren give me her take on the Coronavirus.
160380	164900	Coronavirus has also caused the GDC, the Game Developers Conference, to be postponed.
164900	168700	And apparently while it was happening back on February 28th, a whole bunch of indie game
168700	172420	devs were stuck in the city with hotels they couldn't refund and nothing to do.
172420	176820	Also, since they're on the subject of video games, Plague Inc. has been removed from the
176820	179800	China App Store and Steam.
179800	184020	The real-time strategy game has been taken down due to illegal content.
184020	187180	It was in China for years before, it wasn't illegal then.
187180	193420	Additionally, an Arkansas woman causes a courthouse evacuation by claiming she has Coronavirus.
193420	195700	I'm surprised it wasn't a Florida woman.
195700	199180	And boy, that is the face of regret, if there's ever been one.
199180	203100	An Arkansas woman sent a courtroom into chaos by claiming she had come down with the Coronavirus
203100	205540	and she is now facing criminal charges for it.
205540	209400	She was brought to a local hospital where she tested negative for the virus.
209400	212240	As far as we can tell, she lied about having Coronavirus.
212240	216100	The episode led to more charges against her for filing a false report, obstructing governmental
216100	218100	operations and contempt of court.
218100	223020	You know, if you're already arrested for something and you're in court dealing with it, maybe
223020	225380	you should just leave it there, you know.
225380	229460	Most sleeping dogs lie, don't claim you have Coronavirus to get out of it.
229460	235300	The West's medical apparatus seems to be creaking and groaning under the strain of Coronavirus.
235300	239260	This is from the US Surgeon General, seriously people, stop buying masks.
239260	242940	They're not effective in preventing general public from catching Coronavirus, but if healthcare
242940	246700	providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them in our communities
246700	247700	at risk.
247700	249240	Now this is technically true.
249240	252820	A mask won't prevent you from getting Coronavirus, it'll just prevent you from spreading it to
252820	253820	other people.
253820	258440	We are living in a timeline where the US medical apparatus is so poorly put together that you
258440	264280	have the US Surgeon General asking people to not buy commercially available products
264280	267380	because their doctors will have to go and stock up on their own.
267380	269660	But it's just a flu, right?
269660	271180	But there's more incompetence.
271180	279340	The CDC refused to test first possible community transmitted Coronavirus case for days.
279340	283660	In the UK, the NHS is struggling to cope with the volume of Coronavirus calls.
283660	288040	Callers give up after failing to get a reply or waiting hours and even days for clinicians
288040	289160	to call them back.
289160	291620	The stock market's begun to collapse.
291620	295480	Coronavirus crash wipes 5 trillion off of world stocks.
295480	299060	These are highly uncertain times, no one really knows the answer and the markets are really
299060	300060	panicking.
300060	302660	It's not just stocks though, it's also productivity.
302660	307040	Coronavirus could cost the global economy 1.1 trillion in lost income.
307040	311600	The virus is already having a chilling effect as China factory closures continue to spread.
311600	316580	The latest explosive epicenter is Iran for the Coronavirus, and this is a thread from
316580	320100	somebody who seems to know some information about the area.
320100	323100	Coronavirus epidemic in Iran has passed the crisis level.
323100	324940	The country is imploding.
324940	327500	Law and order is to disappear in the next few days.
327500	330980	A number of government officials have already died and mass infection among hospital staff
330980	332660	and police forces are reported.
332660	336220	The regime hid the initial cases, since it was just before an election and they needed
336220	337220	high turnout.
337220	340540	Let's be honest guys, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump's doing the same thing here.
340540	344480	Trump entirely runs on an economic platform, and if there's an economic downturn due to
344480	346720	the Coronavirus it might backfire in his face.
346720	347720	2.
347720	349480	Due to political need they didn't stop travel to China.
349480	350480	3.
350480	353760	The source seems to be clerical students from China arriving in Qom, which is the biggest
353760	354760	epicenter.
354760	355760	4.
355760	358240	Iran didn't close the religious shrines.
358240	359240	5.
359240	362260	Instead of providing information on the gravity of the rest of the public, they played it
362260	365600	down and resorted to the same tactic of rhetoric, we will fight and beat it.
365600	366600	Now it has spread everywhere.
366600	369680	This is an Iranian MP who got the virus and died.
369820	371980	A well-known filmmaker in Iran, he's died.
371980	375340	Number of graves are being dug seem to be related to the high casualty of corona in
375340	376980	the province of Galan.
376980	378740	Airline staff collapsing at the airport.
378740	382920	This morgue ambulance was reported to have been abandoned after carrying a victim of
382920	383920	coronavirus.
383920	387820	They just abandoned it.
387820	388820	Wow dude.
388820	389820	6.
389820	392740	A clinic in the south of Iran has been torched by angry locals after allegedly 10 corona
392740	394300	patients were transferred to the center.
394300	396060	They just burned it?
396060	400280	Oh my fucking god dude.
400280	404280	Yeah they just lit it up.
404280	406200	Holy shit dude.
406200	408840	Yeah that's smart.
408840	412080	Burn the hospitals that are actually caring for the patients.
412080	413720	You fucking idiots.
413720	418800	And speaking of fucking idiots, Iranians are licking religious shrines in defiance of the
418800	421880	coronavirus spread.
421880	423680	Yeah.
423680	426700	This has to be peak Darwin award at this point.
426700	427700	I get it.
427700	428700	It's a test of faith.
428700	431820	It's like oh look I believe so much that my god will protect me.
431820	436340	I will lick this religious shrine and I will not get the virus.
436340	438920	You guys are all gonna fucking die oh my god.
438920	443540	These pro-regime people are licking the shrines and encouraging people to visit them.
443540	446900	Iran's authorities are endangering the lives of Iranians and the world.
446900	450820	The shrine is considered a place for healing and those who are photographed licking the
450820	453400	door say they don't care what happens.
453400	455980	I can't believe this is the world in which I live.
455980	460780	There have been some reports of Trump being a bit flippant about the virus saying oh yeah
460780	463120	we got under control guys don't worry it's not a big deal.
463120	467520	I don't think that he's being an idiot like that that some of those hashtags suggested.
467520	471620	I think he's trying to downplay the coronavirus because he doesn't want to affect 2020.
471620	476620	However in reply to that you get insanity like this leftist Denver councilwoman cheers
476620	480740	the idea of infecting Trump rallies with the coronavirus.
480740	485640	Denver city councilwoman was hit with calls to resign on Tuesday after she showed support
485640	490960	for a tweet floating the idea of attending Make America Great Again rallies to infect
490960	493020	Trump supporters with the coronavirus.
493020	499480	She tweeted hashtag solidarity yes for the record if I do get the coronavirus I'm attending
499480	501360	every mega rally I can.
501360	504440	I really thought it was just a flu guys like isn't that what you've been saying?
504440	508000	Isn't that what the left has been saying trying to downplay this as Sinophobia it's just a
508000	509000	flu?
509000	510980	You're just being racist against Chinese people?
510980	515100	Oh but as soon as you can become a living fucking bioweapon you're all over it right?
515100	519180	I've never gotten the coronavirus and I've never gone to a Trump rally but if I get the
519180	520900	first I'm doing the second.
520900	525260	If I contracted coronavirus I would go out and try to attend every Trump rally possible.
525260	529280	All I'm saying is if you do think you have coronavirus you should immediately attend
529280	532380	a Trump rally to be briefed by the president on what to do.
532380	536100	He is an expert on everything and I'm sure there will be at least a few prescribing doctors
536100	537100	in the crowd.
537100	541120	If I find out I have the coronavirus I'm going to attend every Trump rally I can till I fall
541120	542120	over dead.
542120	544360	Now I get it right it's jokes it's memes.
544360	547920	I can see the black humor in it for sure but it is a little bit different when an elected
547920	550200	official says they're going to do it.
550200	554400	It's a bad time for the neoliberal shitheels over at the EU.
554400	558120	Coronavirus nightmare could be the end for Europe's borderless dream.
558120	562980	The crown jewel of the EU its network of open internal borders has been hit hard by the
562980	564460	refugee crisis.
564460	566400	The virus could deliver another blow.
566400	570540	If you needed another reason as to why open borders just doesn't work here it is.
570540	573500	Amazon's also told its employees to not do any traveling.
573500	576520	And honestly this is probably a good idea because if you have like an Amazon packer
576520	581380	who has the coronavirus and he's spreading it into every package that could be nightmarish.
581380	586260	Toronto is getting an Asian food festival in response to coronavirus fears nope nope
586260	587780	nope no thank you.
587780	590540	No thank you man with bat apron I'm not interested.
590540	593440	Oh yeah and there was this shit I almost forgot.
593440	598020	Amazon's deputy health minister and I think also the V.P. as well tests positive as the
598020	600900	coronavirus outbreak worsens.
600900	602520	Check this out dude.
602520	608020	So he's here and he's like off to the side talking about the coronavirus and how they've
608020	612860	got it all under control and how things are OK and he starts sweating like a fountain
612860	620700	on live TV and it turns out he has coronavirus holy shit.
620700	624240	This is like this is the kind of thing that you see at the beginning of the zombie story
624240	625920	before the outbreak happens.
625920	631440	Same energy by the way guy who was quarantined and said he was fine can't stop coughing during
631440	635720	his interview with Fox.
635720	637480	Why would you share it with your dog.
637480	638480	Why would you.
638480	640540	Oh my fucking God.
640540	642800	But forget Iran's vice president forget the pope.
642800	643800	G.T.S.
643800	650480	Vivian has caught and been killed by the coronavirus unfortunately GTS Vivian was a prominent artist
650480	653900	in the giantess fetish community.
653900	658260	And yes I'm sure there's a few jokes you can make here and maybe in the future but it's
658260	659700	still a person who's dead.
659700	663080	Italy's followed in Japan's footsteps and decided to close down all the schools.
663080	667440	Meanwhile the World Health Organization has finally announced its official death rate
667440	670700	for the coronavirus and it's at three point four percent.
670700	671740	It's not a crazy amount.
671740	676020	If you get it you have a 97 percent chance of surviving it but that's higher than SARS
676020	681240	it's higher than the flu and it seems to actually disproportionately kill old people.
681240	683760	So this might be the end of the boomer generation after all.
683760	686240	We have to talk about China's involvement again though.
686240	688540	This article here don't buy China's story.
688540	690920	The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.
690920	691920	OK fair enough.
691920	695000	This is all stuff that we've heard before you know the what did it come from the wet
695000	697400	market did it come from the bio lab.
697400	698400	Who knows.
698400	701160	However there's an interesting bit in here that we should probably talk about.
701160	706580	Some Chinese researchers at the bio lab are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals
706580	711540	to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them instead of properly
711540	715300	disposing of infected animals by cremation as the law requires.
715300	720200	They sell them on the side to make a little extra cash or in some cases a lot of extra
720200	721200	cash.
721200	726460	One Beijing researcher now in jail made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats
726460	731020	on the live animal market where they eventually wound up in someone's stomach.
731020	732020	Here we go.
732020	733080	That's probably where it came from.
733080	734520	Someone sold out the Batman.
734520	738600	And of course we all know that everyone the Americans the Chinese whoever they're all
738600	742100	cooking the numbers to try and avoid a global economic depression.
742100	747320	Leaked documents reveal coronavirus infections up to 52 times higher than reported figures
747320	749040	in China's Shandong province.
749040	752740	There is no way that Iran has 66 deaths with only a couple hundred cases.
752740	754860	It's not possible at a death rate of 3 percent.
754860	756920	This thing is everywhere for real.
756920	760880	And now we have to get into the tin foil hat territory where this might be an actual
760880	762660	super virus or something.
762660	767200	Wuhan to quarantine all cured patients for 14 days after some of them tested positive
767200	768200	again.
768200	771780	There is a chance that after you've been cured of this disease you still spread it
771780	774080	around and that's just how it is.
774080	776280	You become an asymptomatic carrier.
776280	777280	It's entirely possible.
777280	783360	The coronavirus is far more likely than SARS to bond to human cells due to HIV like mutation.
783360	786900	Again you might just become an asymptomatic carrier after you get it spreading it to everyone.
786900	790060	This might just be a thing that humanity now has to live with.
790060	793140	Additionally, this new bitter research just came out.
793140	798080	Researchers identify two coronavirus strains as the Chinese case's dwindle.
798080	801900	Scientists in China studying the outbreak of the disease caused by the new coronavirus
801900	805800	say they have found that two main strains of the virus are circulating in humans and
805800	806800	causing infections.
806800	807800	That's interesting.
807800	810420	Maybe we are at the point where mutations have actually begun to happen and things are
810420	811420	splitting off.
811420	814660	I do recall that I think it was with Ebola or one of these diseases.
814660	816900	It fundamentally wasn't humans that stopped it.
816900	821140	Nature stopped itself because an asymptomatic variant evolved naturally and then started
821140	822640	inoculating the population.
822640	827100	The preliminary study found that a more aggressive strain of the new coronavirus associated with
827100	832660	the outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70% of analyzed cases, while 30% were linked
832660	834300	to a less aggressive type.
834300	839300	The prevalence of the more aggressive virus type decreased after early January 2020.
839300	843540	Now on the one hand this is from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and it quite literally
843540	848660	could just be propaganda to try and calm the world down or make China look better or
848660	850260	prevent an economic slump or something.
850260	853380	On the other hand it might actually be a cause for legitimate hope.
853380	855620	Maybe things aren't as bad as they seem sometimes.
855620	856620	Who knows?
856620	858340	We'll have to wait and see.
858340	861060	As they say, further immediate studies are needed.
861060	866660	And of course the ACE2 expression in kidney and testis may cause kidney and testis damage
866660	868660	after the coronavirus infection.
868660	870780	Now there's a lot to go through here.
870780	873920	I'm definitely not a scientist and there's a lot of scientific talk here.
873920	876780	But here's my basic layman's understanding of it.
876780	882620	The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a major receptor that mediates the entry of the coronavirus
882620	883620	into human cells.
883620	887620	This is an enzyme overwhelmingly found in Asian populations, which may mean that this
887620	890680	virus is more infectious to Asians than other people.
890680	895400	At the same time it causes kidney and testicle damage, which does partially corroborate the
895400	898120	reports that this thing will make you infertile after you get it.
898120	901160	This is all still up in the air, but it seems like it might be a nightmare disease.
901160	904920	But if it is the case that this thing at least somewhat selects by race, or that it leaves
904920	908960	lasting permanent damage after it's done with you, or that you can continue infecting people
908960	910720	long after you've been cured of it.
910720	915740	One of my mods in my Discord server, she theorized that this would actually cause a new form
915740	917480	of discrimination to come about.
917480	921320	Where people who have been infected with it, even though they suffered no ill effects,
921320	924840	because they're spreading it around, they're going to be treated like a second-class citizen.
924880	929920	Imagine an entire society full of Typhoid Marys and like, a very stratified class system.
929920	930920	That might be our future.
930920	935520	And of course, China being China, they're now forcing their workers back to work in
935520	937120	order to avoid an economic collapse.
937120	941120	Doesn't matter if you're sick, doesn't matter who else gets sick, get back to work.
941120	946240	Meanwhile these Chinese people had their apartment block forcibly demolished by the government
946240	948920	in the efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus.
948920	953120	The land will be used for something else, and the people who live there, they're now
953120	954120	simply homeless.
954400	958920	Oh, and by the way, if you're in China driving around, this is how you'd be treated now.
958920	961160	These are coronavirus checkpoints.
961160	964960	In order to even travel now, you have to be scanned with a handheld thermometer, and then
964960	969860	they have SWAT teams in hazmat suits ready to force you into quarantine if you even have
969860	970360	a fever.
977200	981360	Of course, this guy's a moron for taking off his face mask, and he did kind of deserve
981480	986160	this at the end, but I understand him being pissed, like, Jesus, this is some draconian
986160	987880	ass shit, dude.
987880	991720	This really does look like it's out of a sci-fi movie, isn't it?
991720	993120	Man.
993120	997200	Now they're like spraying down the car and spraying down the- oh my god.
997200	1000760	Alright, that's all the coronavirus news I have for you today.
1000760	1002480	Even in my city, things are starting to heat up.
1002480	1004200	There have been some shortages of food.
1004200	1009280	I went to the grocery store a couple days ago, and there was definitely a crowd in there.
1009280	1010800	People are starting to notice.
1010800	1014520	If you haven't done your supply stock up a month ago, like when I was saying to do
1014520	1016940	it, it might be a lot harder to do it now.
1016940	1020280	If you are still in a relatively quiet area, and you still happen to have the luxury of
1020280	1022120	time, don't wait.
1022120	1023560	Go out and get some extra food.
1023560	1025680	And most importantly of all, don't panic.
1025680	1028080	Even if you have coronavirus, don't panic.
1028080	1029320	It's not likely to kill you.
1029320	1033200	All of those long-term side effects are still unconfirmed, and to be honest, things will
1033200	1034200	probably be just fine.
1034200	1038640	I know the meme is LOL is just a flu, bro, but if you get it, and for some reason you're
1038640	1041880	not going to the hospital, or they won't take you, or for some reason you're stuck
1041880	1045080	on your own, then your best bet is to probably treat it like a flu.
1045080	1049480	Rest up, stay in bed, take medication, eat some decent food, chicken soup, you know how
1049480	1050480	to do it.
1050480	1053240	Remember, I said chicken soup, not bat soup, alright?
1053240	1054240	And you know what?
1054240	1055240	You probably won't die.
1055240	1056800	We're all probably going to make it.
1056800	1060480	What kills people right now isn't the virus, it's panic, and you have to avoid that.
1060480	1062440	Alright my friends, good luck out there.
1062440	1063440	I love you.
1063440	1067360	Oh yeah, I almost forgot.
1067360	1069800	virus-themed porn is going viral.
1069800	1071240	The internet's a wonderful place, isn't it?
