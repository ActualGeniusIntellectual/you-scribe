1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome to coronavirus land guys, I figure that I'll be doing coronavirus stuff from

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,760
now until this thing blows over, if it ever does.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,980
Current totals are at 94,250 confirmed, that probably means we're at like 250,000 or something

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,520
unconfirmed.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,600
Total deaths is at 3,214, total recovered is at 51,038.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,640
So yeah, by the stats, this is more deadly than SARS, this is more deadly than the various

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,020
other outbreaks we've had in the past 20 years or so, but this definitely does seem

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,600
to be the big one, or at least this century's big one.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,120
But at the same time, considering these numbers, you're likely not to die if you actually

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
catch this.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,520
And let's be clear, you will catch this.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,680
This thing's incubation period is so ridiculously long, I could have it right now and I don't

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
even know.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,920
So you will probably get it and you will probably be fine, there's no reason to panic.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,880
But yeah, there's almost no point even going over what countries have it now because it

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,940
just keeps popping up everywhere, there's a new case in a bunch of these other countries

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,000
that used to not have it, it'll go everywhere eventually I think.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,400
A viewer of mine, Ranger Aqua, passed on this flyer that was put up at his local Costco,

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,440
and apparently these are being put up at a lot of Costcos everywhere.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,440
We are currently sold out of the following items.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,720
All brands of toilet paper, Arrowhead Water, Glaxo, Glaco, whatever, Smart Water, all Kirkland

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Noodle Soup, Baked Beans, all 25 pound bags of rice, and Spam.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,400
If you are currently living in an area where there's no shortages of anything, go out and

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
get your stuff now, be prepared.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,920
If you are living in an area where there are shortages, then you should have listened to

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
me a month ago and got your food.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,720
I'm personally stocked up with enough food to last like six months, so I'm good, and

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,700
I hope you guys are smart enough to get yourself into a similar situation as me.

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,620
There have been some rather stupid happenings though, for example, 38% of Americans was

33
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,540
a trending phrase on Twitter, and it's because 38% of Americans thought that the Coronavirus

34
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,260
came from Corona Beer.

35
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
Good job guys.

36
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,860
But other hashtags that started the trend are Trump virus, and Trump lies about the

37
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,860
Coronavirus.

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,420
I don't know how you could possibly blame this thing on Trump.

39
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,340
Considering that this virus came from China, and the quarantine failed because of the ineptness

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,220
of the Chinese Communist government, I don't know how you could possibly blame this on

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
Trump.

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
This is going to try.

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,100
Let's call it the Trump virus.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,180
If you're feeling awful, you know who to blame.

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,300
However, this is an opinion piece written by opinion columnist Gail Collins, which means

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,380
that it's quite literally full of fluff.

47
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,060
I don't get why these news outlets have opinion pieces.

48
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,380
I go to you for news not to listen to off-brand Elizabeth Warren give me her take on the Coronavirus.

49
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,900
Coronavirus has also caused the GDC, the Game Developers Conference, to be postponed.

50
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,700
And apparently while it was happening back on February 28th, a whole bunch of indie game

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,420
devs were stuck in the city with hotels they couldn't refund and nothing to do.

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,820
Also, since they're on the subject of video games, Plague Inc. has been removed from the

53
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,800
China App Store and Steam.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,020
The real-time strategy game has been taken down due to illegal content.

55
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,180
It was in China for years before, it wasn't illegal then.

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,420
Additionally, an Arkansas woman causes a courthouse evacuation by claiming she has Coronavirus.

57
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm surprised it wasn't a Florida woman.

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,180
And boy, that is the face of regret, if there's ever been one.

59
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,100
An Arkansas woman sent a courtroom into chaos by claiming she had come down with the Coronavirus

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,540
and she is now facing criminal charges for it.

61
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,400
She was brought to a local hospital where she tested negative for the virus.

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,240
As far as we can tell, she lied about having Coronavirus.

63
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,100
The episode led to more charges against her for filing a false report, obstructing governmental

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
operations and contempt of court.

65
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,020
You know, if you're already arrested for something and you're in court dealing with it, maybe

66
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,380
you should just leave it there, you know.

67
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,460
Most sleeping dogs lie, don't claim you have Coronavirus to get out of it.

68
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,300
The West's medical apparatus seems to be creaking and groaning under the strain of Coronavirus.

69
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,260
This is from the US Surgeon General, seriously people, stop buying masks.

70
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,940
They're not effective in preventing general public from catching Coronavirus, but if healthcare

71
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,700
providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them in our communities

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
at risk.

73
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,240
Now this is technically true.

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,820
A mask won't prevent you from getting Coronavirus, it'll just prevent you from spreading it to

75
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,820
other people.

76
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,440
We are living in a timeline where the US medical apparatus is so poorly put together that you

77
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,280
have the US Surgeon General asking people to not buy commercially available products

78
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,380
because their doctors will have to go and stock up on their own.

79
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,660
But it's just a flu, right?

80
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,180
But there's more incompetence.

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:39,340
The CDC refused to test first possible community transmitted Coronavirus case for days.

82
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,660
In the UK, the NHS is struggling to cope with the volume of Coronavirus calls.

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,040
Callers give up after failing to get a reply or waiting hours and even days for clinicians

84
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,160
to call them back.

85
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,620
The stock market's begun to collapse.

86
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,480
Coronavirus crash wipes 5 trillion off of world stocks.

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,060
These are highly uncertain times, no one really knows the answer and the markets are really

88
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,060
panicking.

89
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,660
It's not just stocks though, it's also productivity.

90
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,040
Coronavirus could cost the global economy 1.1 trillion in lost income.

91
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,600
The virus is already having a chilling effect as China factory closures continue to spread.

92
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,580
The latest explosive epicenter is Iran for the Coronavirus, and this is a thread from

93
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,100
somebody who seems to know some information about the area.

94
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Coronavirus epidemic in Iran has passed the crisis level.

95
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,940
The country is imploding.

96
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,500
Law and order is to disappear in the next few days.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,980
A number of government officials have already died and mass infection among hospital staff

98
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,660
and police forces are reported.

99
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,220
The regime hid the initial cases, since it was just before an election and they needed

100
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,220
high turnout.

101
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,540
Let's be honest guys, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump's doing the same thing here.

102
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,480
Trump entirely runs on an economic platform, and if there's an economic downturn due to

103
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,720
the Coronavirus it might backfire in his face.

104
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
2.

105
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,480
Due to political need they didn't stop travel to China.

106
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
3.

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,760
The source seems to be clerical students from China arriving in Qom, which is the biggest

108
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
epicenter.

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
4.

110
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,240
Iran didn't close the religious shrines.

111
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
5.

112
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,260
Instead of providing information on the gravity of the rest of the public, they played it

113
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,600
down and resorted to the same tactic of rhetoric, we will fight and beat it.

114
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Now it has spread everywhere.

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,680
This is an Iranian MP who got the virus and died.

116
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,980
A well-known filmmaker in Iran, he's died.

117
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,340
Number of graves are being dug seem to be related to the high casualty of corona in

118
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,980
the province of Galan.

119
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,740
Airline staff collapsing at the airport.

120
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,920
This morgue ambulance was reported to have been abandoned after carrying a victim of

121
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
coronavirus.

122
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,820
They just abandoned it.

123
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Wow dude.

124
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
6.

125
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,740
A clinic in the south of Iran has been torched by angry locals after allegedly 10 corona

126
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,300
patients were transferred to the center.

127
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,060
They just burned it?

128
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,280
Oh my fucking god dude.

129
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah they just lit it up.

130
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,200
Holy shit dude.

131
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,840
Yeah that's smart.

132
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,080
Burn the hospitals that are actually caring for the patients.

133
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,720
You fucking idiots.

134
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,800
And speaking of fucking idiots, Iranians are licking religious shrines in defiance of the

135
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,880
coronavirus spread.

136
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Yeah.

137
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,700
This has to be peak Darwin award at this point.

138
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
I get it.

139
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
It's a test of faith.

140
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,820
It's like oh look I believe so much that my god will protect me.

141
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,340
I will lick this religious shrine and I will not get the virus.

142
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,920
You guys are all gonna fucking die oh my god.

143
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,540
These pro-regime people are licking the shrines and encouraging people to visit them.

144
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,900
Iran's authorities are endangering the lives of Iranians and the world.

145
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,820
The shrine is considered a place for healing and those who are photographed licking the

146
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,400
door say they don't care what happens.

147
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,980
I can't believe this is the world in which I live.

148
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,780
There have been some reports of Trump being a bit flippant about the virus saying oh yeah

149
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,120
we got under control guys don't worry it's not a big deal.

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,520
I don't think that he's being an idiot like that that some of those hashtags suggested.

151
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,620
I think he's trying to downplay the coronavirus because he doesn't want to affect 2020.

152
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,620
However in reply to that you get insanity like this leftist Denver councilwoman cheers

153
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,740
the idea of infecting Trump rallies with the coronavirus.

154
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,640
Denver city councilwoman was hit with calls to resign on Tuesday after she showed support

155
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,960
for a tweet floating the idea of attending Make America Great Again rallies to infect

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,020
Trump supporters with the coronavirus.

157
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:19,480
She tweeted hashtag solidarity yes for the record if I do get the coronavirus I'm attending

158
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,360
every mega rally I can.

159
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,440
I really thought it was just a flu guys like isn't that what you've been saying?

160
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Isn't that what the left has been saying trying to downplay this as Sinophobia it's just a

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
flu?

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,980
You're just being racist against Chinese people?

163
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh but as soon as you can become a living fucking bioweapon you're all over it right?

164
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,180
I've never gotten the coronavirus and I've never gone to a Trump rally but if I get the

165
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,900
first I'm doing the second.

166
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,260
If I contracted coronavirus I would go out and try to attend every Trump rally possible.

167
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,280
All I'm saying is if you do think you have coronavirus you should immediately attend

168
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,380
a Trump rally to be briefed by the president on what to do.

169
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,100
He is an expert on everything and I'm sure there will be at least a few prescribing doctors

170
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
in the crowd.

171
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,120
If I find out I have the coronavirus I'm going to attend every Trump rally I can till I fall

172
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
over dead.

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,360
Now I get it right it's jokes it's memes.

174
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,920
I can see the black humor in it for sure but it is a little bit different when an elected

175
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,200
official says they're going to do it.

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,400
It's a bad time for the neoliberal shitheels over at the EU.

177
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,120
Coronavirus nightmare could be the end for Europe's borderless dream.

178
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,980
The crown jewel of the EU its network of open internal borders has been hit hard by the

179
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,460
refugee crisis.

180
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,400
The virus could deliver another blow.

181
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,540
If you needed another reason as to why open borders just doesn't work here it is.

182
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,500
Amazon's also told its employees to not do any traveling.

183
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,520
And honestly this is probably a good idea because if you have like an Amazon packer

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,380
who has the coronavirus and he's spreading it into every package that could be nightmarish.

185
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,260
Toronto is getting an Asian food festival in response to coronavirus fears nope nope

186
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,780
nope no thank you.

187
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,540
No thank you man with bat apron I'm not interested.

188
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,440
Oh yeah and there was this shit I almost forgot.

189
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,020
Amazon's deputy health minister and I think also the V.P. as well tests positive as the

190
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,900
coronavirus outbreak worsens.

191
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,520
Check this out dude.

192
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,020
So he's here and he's like off to the side talking about the coronavirus and how they've

193
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,860
got it all under control and how things are OK and he starts sweating like a fountain

194
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,700
on live TV and it turns out he has coronavirus holy shit.

195
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,240
This is like this is the kind of thing that you see at the beginning of the zombie story

196
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
before the outbreak happens.

197
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,440
Same energy by the way guy who was quarantined and said he was fine can't stop coughing during

198
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,720
his interview with Fox.

199
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,480
Why would you share it with your dog.

200
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Why would you.

201
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,540
Oh my fucking God.

202
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,800
But forget Iran's vice president forget the pope.

203
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
G.T.S.

204
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:50,480
Vivian has caught and been killed by the coronavirus unfortunately GTS Vivian was a prominent artist

205
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,900
in the giantess fetish community.

206
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,260
And yes I'm sure there's a few jokes you can make here and maybe in the future but it's

207
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,700
still a person who's dead.

208
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,080
Italy's followed in Japan's footsteps and decided to close down all the schools.

209
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,440
Meanwhile the World Health Organization has finally announced its official death rate

210
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,700
for the coronavirus and it's at three point four percent.

211
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,740
It's not a crazy amount.

212
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,020
If you get it you have a 97 percent chance of surviving it but that's higher than SARS

213
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,240
it's higher than the flu and it seems to actually disproportionately kill old people.

214
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,760
So this might be the end of the boomer generation after all.

215
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
We have to talk about China's involvement again though.

216
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,540
This article here don't buy China's story.

217
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,920
The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.

218
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
OK fair enough.

219
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,000
This is all stuff that we've heard before you know the what did it come from the wet

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,400
market did it come from the bio lab.

221
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Who knows.

222
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,160
However there's an interesting bit in here that we should probably talk about.

223
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,580
Some Chinese researchers at the bio lab are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals

224
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,540
to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them instead of properly

225
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,300
disposing of infected animals by cremation as the law requires.

226
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,200
They sell them on the side to make a little extra cash or in some cases a lot of extra

227
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
cash.

228
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,460
One Beijing researcher now in jail made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats

229
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,020
on the live animal market where they eventually wound up in someone's stomach.

230
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
Here we go.

231
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,080
That's probably where it came from.

232
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,520
Someone sold out the Batman.

233
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,600
And of course we all know that everyone the Americans the Chinese whoever they're all

234
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,100
cooking the numbers to try and avoid a global economic depression.

235
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,320
Leaked documents reveal coronavirus infections up to 52 times higher than reported figures

236
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,040
in China's Shandong province.

237
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,740
There is no way that Iran has 66 deaths with only a couple hundred cases.

238
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,860
It's not possible at a death rate of 3 percent.

239
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,920
This thing is everywhere for real.

240
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,880
And now we have to get into the tin foil hat territory where this might be an actual

241
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,660
super virus or something.

242
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,200
Wuhan to quarantine all cured patients for 14 days after some of them tested positive

243
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
again.

244
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,780
There is a chance that after you've been cured of this disease you still spread it

245
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,080
around and that's just how it is.

246
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,280
You become an asymptomatic carrier.

247
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
It's entirely possible.

248
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,360
The coronavirus is far more likely than SARS to bond to human cells due to HIV like mutation.

249
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,900
Again you might just become an asymptomatic carrier after you get it spreading it to everyone.

250
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,060
This might just be a thing that humanity now has to live with.

251
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,140
Additionally, this new bitter research just came out.

252
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,080
Researchers identify two coronavirus strains as the Chinese case's dwindle.

253
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,900
Scientists in China studying the outbreak of the disease caused by the new coronavirus

254
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,800
say they have found that two main strains of the virus are circulating in humans and

255
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
causing infections.

256
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
That's interesting.

257
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,420
Maybe we are at the point where mutations have actually begun to happen and things are

258
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,420
splitting off.

259
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,660
I do recall that I think it was with Ebola or one of these diseases.

260
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,900
It fundamentally wasn't humans that stopped it.

261
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,140
Nature stopped itself because an asymptomatic variant evolved naturally and then started

262
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,640
inoculating the population.

263
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,100
The preliminary study found that a more aggressive strain of the new coronavirus associated with

264
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,660
the outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70% of analyzed cases, while 30% were linked

265
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,300
to a less aggressive type.

266
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,300
The prevalence of the more aggressive virus type decreased after early January 2020.

267
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,540
Now on the one hand this is from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and it quite literally

268
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,660
could just be propaganda to try and calm the world down or make China look better or

269
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,260
prevent an economic slump or something.

270
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,380
On the other hand it might actually be a cause for legitimate hope.

271
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,620
Maybe things aren't as bad as they seem sometimes.

272
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Who knows?

273
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,340
We'll have to wait and see.

274
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,060
As they say, further immediate studies are needed.

275
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,660
And of course the ACE2 expression in kidney and testis may cause kidney and testis damage

276
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
after the coronavirus infection.

277
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,780
Now there's a lot to go through here.

278
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm definitely not a scientist and there's a lot of scientific talk here.

279
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,780
But here's my basic layman's understanding of it.

280
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,620
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a major receptor that mediates the entry of the coronavirus

281
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,620
into human cells.

282
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,620
This is an enzyme overwhelmingly found in Asian populations, which may mean that this

283
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,680
virus is more infectious to Asians than other people.

284
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,400
At the same time it causes kidney and testicle damage, which does partially corroborate the

285
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,120
reports that this thing will make you infertile after you get it.

286
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,160
This is all still up in the air, but it seems like it might be a nightmare disease.

287
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,920
But if it is the case that this thing at least somewhat selects by race, or that it leaves

288
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,960
lasting permanent damage after it's done with you, or that you can continue infecting people

289
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,720
long after you've been cured of it.

290
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,740
One of my mods in my Discord server, she theorized that this would actually cause a new form

291
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,480
of discrimination to come about.

292
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,320
Where people who have been infected with it, even though they suffered no ill effects,

293
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,840
because they're spreading it around, they're going to be treated like a second-class citizen.

294
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,920
Imagine an entire society full of Typhoid Marys and like, a very stratified class system.

295
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
That might be our future.

296
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,520
And of course, China being China, they're now forcing their workers back to work in

297
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,120
order to avoid an economic collapse.

298
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Doesn't matter if you're sick, doesn't matter who else gets sick, get back to work.

299
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,240
Meanwhile these Chinese people had their apartment block forcibly demolished by the government

300
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,920
in the efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus.

301
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,120
The land will be used for something else, and the people who live there, they're now

302
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
simply homeless.

303
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,920
Oh, and by the way, if you're in China driving around, this is how you'd be treated now.

304
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,160
These are coronavirus checkpoints.

305
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,960
In order to even travel now, you have to be scanned with a handheld thermometer, and then

306
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,860
they have SWAT teams in hazmat suits ready to force you into quarantine if you even have

307
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,360
a fever.

308
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,360
Of course, this guy's a moron for taking off his face mask, and he did kind of deserve

309
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,160
this at the end, but I understand him being pissed, like, Jesus, this is some draconian

310
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,880
ass shit, dude.

311
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,720
This really does look like it's out of a sci-fi movie, isn't it?

312
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Man.

313
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,200
Now they're like spraying down the car and spraying down the- oh my god.

314
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,760
Alright, that's all the coronavirus news I have for you today.

315
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,480
Even in my city, things are starting to heat up.

316
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,200
There have been some shortages of food.

317
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,280
I went to the grocery store a couple days ago, and there was definitely a crowd in there.

318
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,800
People are starting to notice.

319
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,520
If you haven't done your supply stock up a month ago, like when I was saying to do

320
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,940
it, it might be a lot harder to do it now.

321
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,280
If you are still in a relatively quiet area, and you still happen to have the luxury of

322
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,120
time, don't wait.

323
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,560
Go out and get some extra food.

324
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,680
And most importantly of all, don't panic.

325
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,080
Even if you have coronavirus, don't panic.

326
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,320
It's not likely to kill you.

327
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,200
All of those long-term side effects are still unconfirmed, and to be honest, things will

328
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
probably be just fine.

329
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,640
I know the meme is LOL is just a flu, bro, but if you get it, and for some reason you're

330
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,880
not going to the hospital, or they won't take you, or for some reason you're stuck

331
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,080
on your own, then your best bet is to probably treat it like a flu.

332
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,480
Rest up, stay in bed, take medication, eat some decent food, chicken soup, you know how

333
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
to do it.

334
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,240
Remember, I said chicken soup, not bat soup, alright?

335
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
And you know what?

336
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
You probably won't die.

337
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,800
We're all probably going to make it.

338
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,480
What kills people right now isn't the virus, it's panic, and you have to avoid that.

339
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,440
Alright my friends, good luck out there.

340
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
I love you.

341
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

342
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,800
virus-themed porn is going viral.

343
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,240
The internet's a wonderful place, isn't it?
