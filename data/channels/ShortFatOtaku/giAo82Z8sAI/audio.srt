1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
And so Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the race.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,920
I mean, we all saw this coming, right?

3
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,280
I think even a lot of the Bernie bros that I follow on Twitter, they kind of saw it coming

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
too.

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,540
Even if you actually believe that Bernie Sanders isn't a straight up Venezuelan-style socialist

6
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,240
or like a tanky or something, you can't deny that his staffers certainly are.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,880
I think we've all seen the Project Veritas leaks at this point, where you've got Bernie

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,600
staff simping for the Soviet Union and talking about how the Gulag was actually pretty good.

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:26,280
Crazy stuff, man.

10
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,620
You on head is probably the only Bernie bro that I support.

11
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,060
Is it really a Bernie bro if it's a girl or is it just like a Bernie supporter or something?

12
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,060
Bernie bro's catchy though.

13
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,640
I don't know, maybe she has a penis.

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,580
I don't think so, but it's the internet, so you never really know.

15
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,960
But she's the only Bernie bro that I actually respect, at least of the ones that I've seen

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
so far.

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,740
And I do kind of get where she's coming from.

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,180
For example, she says, you've changed the conversation forever.

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,360
Things you were saying years ago and people were calling you crazy for are now incredibly

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
popular.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,300
I look forward to the next election where every candidate on stage is trying to do their

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,700
best Bernie impression.

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,780
And I mean, fair enough, there's certainly an argument to be made for a universal health

24
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,780
care system.

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,440
That's a debate you can actually have where there's good points on both sides.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,220
And there's definitely a part of me that thinks that it's a little bit crazy that the United

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,420
States doesn't have some kind of, at least a minimum standard of coverage.

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,700
But at the same time, Bernie has rubbed me the wrong way, basically ever since he cucked

29
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,940
out to Hillary in 2016.

30
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,380
And I think I know why.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,960
Shue also said this, the first time I voted for Obama, I started off excited and proud.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,480
I didn't even know what a politic was, but I knew blue team good.

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm only a couple of years older than Shue, I think.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,720
And this definitely describes me in 2004, where it was Bush versus Kerry.

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,400
John Kerry had no charisma.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,960
He had no grassroots backing.

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,920
He had no viable plan for the future should he actually become president, but it was very

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,800
much a blue team good situation.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,080
And back then you could definitely make the argument that the blue team was good.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,740
In 2004, the United States was still struggling with some very obvious things, like gay marriage.

41
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,260
That's just straight up a personal freedoms issue.

42
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,860
And the only arguments against it are religious in nature.

43
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,340
Back during the Bush era, it was the left that stood for personal freedom, and it was

44
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,340
the right that stood for curtailing those freedoms based on primarily religious grounds.

45
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,820
But as I've said in the past few videos, that's not the political dynamic anymore.

46
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,740
The old religious right has largely been swept away.

47
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,860
The new right seems to be much more libertarian leaning, and the left has become a lot more

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,640
authoritarian in the past, say, 20 years.

49
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,320
So for me, when Obama came along, it was more than just blue team good.

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,400
It was the fact that he was at least saying he was going to try something new, the whole

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,860
hope and change thing.

52
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,600
And then as Obama went through his two terms, I kind of realized that whenever a politician

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,340
peddles radical change, they're almost always lying to your face.

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,960
This includes Obama, and yes, it also includes Bernie.

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,520
By contrast, when a politician comes in and advocates for, say, slow and steady incremental

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,080
change, done imperfectly but is a small improvement day by day, not only is that a lot more believable,

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,960
it's a lot more achievable.

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,880
And frankly, maybe I'm just an old man at this point, but I'll take slow and steady

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
any day.

60
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,560
Which is why I no longer have the attitude of blue team good.

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,880
All of my values still align with the core of the left, as it was 20 years ago.

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,460
But in terms of United States politics, it's Republicans that represent that more than

63
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Democrats now.

64
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,980
It's very strange, but blue team good just isn't enough anymore.

65
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,140
There's a lot of trending hashtags about it, this one here is Thank You Bernie.

66
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,500
Of course, not all of them are positive, hashtag Biden 2020 just seems to be full of either

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,520
Bernie bros complaining about it, for example, everyone ready to vote for their favorite

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,760
rapist in November, or alternatively, Democratic shills going blue team good.

69
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,820
Stop being little bitches and start campaigning.

70
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,380
We cannot survive another four years of this shit.

71
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,380
Really.

72
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,800
If you dislike Trump, is the United States actually this dystopian hellscape?

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,740
Things seem to be going okay down there.

74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,360
Of course, you've got dem exit, and you know what, I'm not surprised.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,400
If you want the DNC to learn its lesson, you are going to have to dem exit.

76
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,140
That is just the way this goes now.

77
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,720
You didn't do it in 2016, you still ended up cucking to Hillary, just like Bernie did,

78
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,540
and you can't do it in 2020 if you want there to be actual change in your party.

79
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,920
If for some ridiculous reason, you want the Democratic party to become a socialist party,

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,320
you are going to have to hand them a worse defeat than they faced in 2016, because they

81
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,940
still haven't learned the lesson.

82
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,780
And speaking of blue team good, you also have hashtag vote blue no matter who, because it

83
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,480
seems like both the establishment Democrats and the radical left in the United States

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,400
still just haven't learned their lesson yet.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,540
Of course, it's always kind of funny to laugh at people who have completely lost their minds.

86
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,840
Joe Biden is now US presidential nominee, meaning the Democrats can never again attack

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,400
the Republicans for choosing a lying, senile, racist, war mongering sex offender.

88
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,960
The resistance have shown themselves to be hypocrites in the most astounding way.

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,960
As it turns out, the left is just as morally bankrupt as the right when the chips are down.

90
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,720
I don't know how you can justify blue team good at this point.

91
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Facts.

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm mad Biden is the nominee, I 100% believe the allegations against him.

93
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,100
I wanted someone much more progressive.

94
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Also facts.

95
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,460
Biden or Trump will win.

96
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,200
For progressive legislation down the road, we need blue courts.

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,360
If you don't vote for Biden, you're in the way.

98
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
I thought you wanted a revolution.

99
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,560
I thought you wanted to upend the system.

100
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,460
If you're not willing to actually burn everything down, maybe you should stop playing at it.

101
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,220
Because do you know what it'll take to actually get the DNC to change long term?

102
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,840
Losing so hard, they don't come back for a full generation.

103
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,960
But it seems like you're not willing to do that because you want blue courts.

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,160
Well, you're not going to get them this way.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,020
Wow, I'm heartbroken about Bernie.

106
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,820
In all this darkness, he made me believe that people together could be the light.

107
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,880
He continues to be an inspiration, and he'll never stop fighting for us.

108
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Thank you, Bernie.

109
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,900
For me, you're right up there with Mr. Rogers.

110
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,020
Sarah Silverman, you know that Bernie's not dead, right?

111
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,540
Like most revolutionaries, you are ahead of your time.

112
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,540
And despite resistance from the most powerful people in America, you never stop fighting

113
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,980
for real change.

114
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,420
You have ushered in a new progressive era, and the fight for justice will go on.

115
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,240
As it turns out, most of the electorate doesn't want revolution.

116
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,480
They want incremental improvement.

117
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,400
Real change comes day by day, slowly building it.

118
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
One brick at a time.

119
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,720
I know Americans have this romanticism about revolutions, because, frankly, their country

120
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,360
was founded on a successful one.

121
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,880
But their country was founded on one of the only successful ones.

122
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,680
Most revolutions fail, guys, you have to understand that.

123
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,460
violently turning the whole system on its head doesn't actually create anything stable?

124
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,820
I can't believe I have to be saying this.

125
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,540
And I think most people at least kind of understand this, so Bernie's revolutionary talk just

126
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,860
seems to have alienated a good chunk of the electorate.

127
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,220
I love going back to this Sky City guy, because he seems to be absolutely insane.

128
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,940
Bernie Sanders was my hero before Jeremy Corbyn.

129
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,600
He really ignited the socialist spark in me.

130
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,780
My dream would be for Corbyn and Sanders to start a transatlantic socialist movement with

131
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,380
new political parties.

132
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,160
But alas, I fear both will remain loyal to the corrupt Dems and Labour.

133
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,340
Well, Bernie's gone.

134
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,960
Jeremy Corbyn's gone.

135
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,320
Trudeau is facing some serious trouble up here.

136
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,920
Let's hope this is the end of socialism.

137
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,480
19th century economic philosophy, trying to solve industrial revolution era problems,

138
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,240
problems that have already been solved by modern capitalism, by the way, needs to stay

139
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,400
in the dustbin of history as a failed theory.

140
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,040
Leave communism and socialism in the 20th century, along with Nazism and fascism, as

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,340
the failed murderous experiments that they are.

142
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,980
But of course, we're going down the road of delusion again, aren't we?

143
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Now that Biden's got the nomination, it seems like he's projected to win the presidency.

144
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,180
Of course he is.

145
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,980
Polling numbers show Biden with 351 delegates to Trump's 187.

146
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,900
Yeah, I'm sure this is how November 2020 will go.

147
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,060
The Dems are literally doing the exact same thing again, and they don't seem to understand

148
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,580
that at least some of Bernie's support comes from the fact that he's outside the political

149
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,720
system in the same way that Trump is.

150
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
15% of Sanders supporters will vote for Trump if Biden is the nominee.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,780
I mean, 80 would still back Biden, but that still means that 15% of people that wanted

152
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,920
Bernie are going to go Trump instead of Biden.

153
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,740
That's not an insignificant amount.

154
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,880
And let's be honest, it's completely predictable.

155
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,600
This 2017 article from Newsweek titled, Bernie Sanders Voters Help Trump Win and Here's

156
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,680
Proof, goes through some of the stats and basically determines that 12% of Bernie supporters

157
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,500
were only supporters of Bernie because they were anti-establishment and therefore ended

158
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,420
going up Trump over Hillary.

159
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,980
It's no surprise to me that the same thing would happen to Biden.

160
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,660
Do you recall back in, I think it was 2012, maybe 2000, I think it was 2012 though, when

161
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,620
the Republicans just kept losing to Obama and Obama's mandate seemed to be quite secure.

162
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,300
It was Rachel Maddow who basically made fun of them and basically said that the Republicans

163
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,080
keep trying their old failed shtick and they keep losing.

164
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,120
Even without Florida being decided, we now know that President Obama won in pretty much

165
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,720
exactly the way the state by state polls said he was going to win.

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,540
He won with more than 300 electoral votes.

167
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,580
It was not magic.

168
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,860
It was just math, math that was completely invisible to the political right.

169
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,660
Yes, that's right.

170
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
No that's not.

171
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,180
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

172
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,220
But Republicans and conservatives plainly really believed this stuff.

173
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,080
I mean, they were talking each other into it a little bit, but it's not like they were

174
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
faking it.

175
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,700
They were so, so, so, so, so, so sure they would win.

176
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,500
They were so sure that these polls must be wrong and that they must be right.

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,020
And when the real math of the real world came barreling out of the dark at them last night,

178
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
they hid from it.

179
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,540
They could not believe it.

180
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,400
Ohio really did go to President Obama last night and he really did win.

181
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,620
And he really was born in Hawaii.

182
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,540
And he really is legitimately president of the United States, again.

183
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,720
And the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make up a fake unemployment rate last month.

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,160
And the Congressional Research Service really can find no evidence that cutting taxes on

185
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,500
rich people grows the economy.

186
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,660
And the polls were not skewed to oversample Democrats.

187
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,320
And Nate Silver was not making up fake projections about the election to make conservatives feel

188
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
bad.

189
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,600
Nate Silver was doing math.

190
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,540
And climate change is real.

191
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,180
And rape really does cause pregnancy sometimes.

192
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,260
And evolution is a thing.

193
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,440
And Benghazi was an attack on us.

194
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,700
It was not a scandal by us.

195
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,820
And nobody is taking away anyone's guns.

196
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,640
And taxes have not gone up.

197
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
And the deficit is dropping, actually.

198
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,140
And Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.

199
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,820
And the moon landing was real.

200
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,000
And FEMA is not building concentration camps.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,380
And U.N. election observers are not taking over Texas.

202
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,120
And moderate reforms of the regulations on the insurance industry and the financial services

203
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,820
industry in this country are not the same thing as communism.

204
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,700
Listen, last night was a good night for liberals and for Democrats for very obvious reasons.

205
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,060
But it was also possibly a good night for this country as a whole.

206
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,900
Because in this country, we have a two-party system in government.

207
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,400
And the idea is supposed to be that the two sides both come up with ways to confront and

208
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,840
fix the real problems facing our country.

209
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,140
They both propose possible solutions to our real problems.

210
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,060
And we debate between those possible solutions.

211
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,120
And by the process of debate, we pick the best idea.

212
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,080
That competition between good ideas from both sides about real problems in the real country

213
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,920
should result in our country having better choices, better options than if only one side

214
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,260
is really working on the hard stuff.

215
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,640
And if the Republican Party and the conservative movement and the conservative media is stuck

216
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,320
in a vacuum-sealed door-locked spin cycle of telling each other what makes them feel

217
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,720
good and denying the factual lived truth of the world, then we are all deprived as a nation

218
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,620
of the constructive debate between competing, feasible ideas about real problems.

219
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:50,020
Last night, the Republicans got shellacked, and they had no idea it was coming.

220
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,500
And we saw them in real time, in a real humiliating time, not believe it even as it was happening

221
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,840
to them.

222
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,600
And unless they are going to secede, they are going to have to pop the factual bubble

223
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,340
they have been so happy living inside if they do not want to get shellacked again.

224
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
And that will be a painful process for them, I'm sure.

225
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,900
But it will be good for the whole country, left, right, and center.

226
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,540
You guys, we're counting on you.

227
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,620
Wake up.

228
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,980
There's real problems in the world.

229
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,180
There are real, knowable facts in the world.

230
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,180
Let's accept those and talk about how we might approach our problems differently.

231
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,180
Let's move on from there.

232
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,740
If the Republican Party and the conservative movement and conservative media are forced

233
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,160
to do that by the humiliation they were dealt last night, we will all be better off as a

234
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
nation.

235
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,840
Now, Rachel Maddow isn't actually smart enough to understand that this is the exact

236
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,040
same thing happening to the Democrats right now.

237
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,580
Rather than four more years of stamping your feet, screaming orange man bad, talking about

238
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,000
how everyone who doesn't vote for your candidate is a racist or whatever, you need to figure

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
out what's actually going wrong, or you will keep losing.

240
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,640
The Republicans are all but guaranteed to win 2020, and if the Democrats don't have

241
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:14,060
some humility about this, the Republicans are going to win 2024 as well.
