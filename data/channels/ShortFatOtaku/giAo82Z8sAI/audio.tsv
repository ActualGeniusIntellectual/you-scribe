0	3200	And so Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the race.
30000	44920	I mean, we all saw this coming, right?
44920	49280	I think even a lot of the Bernie bros that I follow on Twitter, they kind of saw it coming
49280	50280	too.
50280	54540	Even if you actually believe that Bernie Sanders isn't a straight up Venezuelan-style socialist
54540	59240	or like a tanky or something, you can't deny that his staffers certainly are.
59240	62880	I think we've all seen the Project Veritas leaks at this point, where you've got Bernie
62880	68600	staff simping for the Soviet Union and talking about how the Gulag was actually pretty good.
68600	86280	Crazy stuff, man.
86280	89620	You on head is probably the only Bernie bro that I support.
89620	95060	Is it really a Bernie bro if it's a girl or is it just like a Bernie supporter or something?
95060	96060	Bernie bro's catchy though.
96060	97640	I don't know, maybe she has a penis.
97640	100580	I don't think so, but it's the internet, so you never really know.
100580	103960	But she's the only Bernie bro that I actually respect, at least of the ones that I've seen
103960	104960	so far.
104960	106740	And I do kind of get where she's coming from.
106740	110180	For example, she says, you've changed the conversation forever.
110180	113360	Things you were saying years ago and people were calling you crazy for are now incredibly
113360	114360	popular.
114360	117300	I look forward to the next election where every candidate on stage is trying to do their
117300	118700	best Bernie impression.
118700	122780	And I mean, fair enough, there's certainly an argument to be made for a universal health
122780	123780	care system.
123780	126440	That's a debate you can actually have where there's good points on both sides.
126440	129220	And there's definitely a part of me that thinks that it's a little bit crazy that the United
129220	132420	States doesn't have some kind of, at least a minimum standard of coverage.
132420	137700	But at the same time, Bernie has rubbed me the wrong way, basically ever since he cucked
137700	139940	out to Hillary in 2016.
139940	141380	And I think I know why.
141400	145960	Shue also said this, the first time I voted for Obama, I started off excited and proud.
145960	149480	I didn't even know what a politic was, but I knew blue team good.
149480	151840	I'm only a couple of years older than Shue, I think.
151840	157720	And this definitely describes me in 2004, where it was Bush versus Kerry.
157720	159400	John Kerry had no charisma.
159400	160960	He had no grassroots backing.
160960	164920	He had no viable plan for the future should he actually become president, but it was very
164920	167800	much a blue team good situation.
167800	171080	And back then you could definitely make the argument that the blue team was good.
171080	176740	In 2004, the United States was still struggling with some very obvious things, like gay marriage.
176740	179260	That's just straight up a personal freedoms issue.
179260	181860	And the only arguments against it are religious in nature.
181860	185340	Back during the Bush era, it was the left that stood for personal freedom, and it was
185340	189340	the right that stood for curtailing those freedoms based on primarily religious grounds.
189340	193820	But as I've said in the past few videos, that's not the political dynamic anymore.
193820	196740	The old religious right has largely been swept away.
196740	200860	The new right seems to be much more libertarian leaning, and the left has become a lot more
200860	203640	authoritarian in the past, say, 20 years.
203640	207320	So for me, when Obama came along, it was more than just blue team good.
207320	211400	It was the fact that he was at least saying he was going to try something new, the whole
211400	212860	hope and change thing.
212860	218600	And then as Obama went through his two terms, I kind of realized that whenever a politician
218600	223340	peddles radical change, they're almost always lying to your face.
223340	226960	This includes Obama, and yes, it also includes Bernie.
226960	232520	By contrast, when a politician comes in and advocates for, say, slow and steady incremental
232520	238080	change, done imperfectly but is a small improvement day by day, not only is that a lot more believable,
238080	239960	it's a lot more achievable.
239960	242880	And frankly, maybe I'm just an old man at this point, but I'll take slow and steady
242880	243880	any day.
243880	246560	Which is why I no longer have the attitude of blue team good.
246560	251880	All of my values still align with the core of the left, as it was 20 years ago.
251880	255460	But in terms of United States politics, it's Republicans that represent that more than
255460	256460	Democrats now.
256460	259980	It's very strange, but blue team good just isn't enough anymore.
259980	264140	There's a lot of trending hashtags about it, this one here is Thank You Bernie.
264140	268500	Of course, not all of them are positive, hashtag Biden 2020 just seems to be full of either
268500	272520	Bernie bros complaining about it, for example, everyone ready to vote for their favorite
272520	277760	rapist in November, or alternatively, Democratic shills going blue team good.
277760	279820	Stop being little bitches and start campaigning.
279820	282380	We cannot survive another four years of this shit.
282380	283380	Really.
283380	288800	If you dislike Trump, is the United States actually this dystopian hellscape?
288800	290740	Things seem to be going okay down there.
290740	294360	Of course, you've got dem exit, and you know what, I'm not surprised.
294360	298400	If you want the DNC to learn its lesson, you are going to have to dem exit.
298400	300140	That is just the way this goes now.
300140	304720	You didn't do it in 2016, you still ended up cucking to Hillary, just like Bernie did,
304720	308540	and you can't do it in 2020 if you want there to be actual change in your party.
308540	313920	If for some ridiculous reason, you want the Democratic party to become a socialist party,
313920	318320	you are going to have to hand them a worse defeat than they faced in 2016, because they
318320	319940	still haven't learned the lesson.
319940	325780	And speaking of blue team good, you also have hashtag vote blue no matter who, because it
325780	329480	seems like both the establishment Democrats and the radical left in the United States
329480	332400	still just haven't learned their lesson yet.
332400	335540	Of course, it's always kind of funny to laugh at people who have completely lost their minds.
335540	339840	Joe Biden is now US presidential nominee, meaning the Democrats can never again attack
339840	344400	the Republicans for choosing a lying, senile, racist, war mongering sex offender.
344400	347960	The resistance have shown themselves to be hypocrites in the most astounding way.
347960	352960	As it turns out, the left is just as morally bankrupt as the right when the chips are down.
352960	356720	I don't know how you can justify blue team good at this point.
356720	357720	Facts.
357720	362040	I'm mad Biden is the nominee, I 100% believe the allegations against him.
362040	364100	I wanted someone much more progressive.
364100	365100	Also facts.
365100	366460	Biden or Trump will win.
366460	369200	For progressive legislation down the road, we need blue courts.
369200	371360	If you don't vote for Biden, you're in the way.
371360	373080	I thought you wanted a revolution.
373080	375560	I thought you wanted to upend the system.
375560	380460	If you're not willing to actually burn everything down, maybe you should stop playing at it.
380460	384220	Because do you know what it'll take to actually get the DNC to change long term?
384220	387840	Losing so hard, they don't come back for a full generation.
387840	390960	But it seems like you're not willing to do that because you want blue courts.
390960	393160	Well, you're not going to get them this way.
393160	396020	Wow, I'm heartbroken about Bernie.
396020	399820	In all this darkness, he made me believe that people together could be the light.
399820	403880	He continues to be an inspiration, and he'll never stop fighting for us.
403880	404880	Thank you, Bernie.
404880	407900	For me, you're right up there with Mr. Rogers.
407900	411020	Sarah Silverman, you know that Bernie's not dead, right?
411020	413540	Like most revolutionaries, you are ahead of your time.
413540	417540	And despite resistance from the most powerful people in America, you never stop fighting
417540	418980	for real change.
418980	422420	You have ushered in a new progressive era, and the fight for justice will go on.
423120	427240	As it turns out, most of the electorate doesn't want revolution.
427240	429480	They want incremental improvement.
429480	433400	Real change comes day by day, slowly building it.
433400	434400	One brick at a time.
434400	438720	I know Americans have this romanticism about revolutions, because, frankly, their country
438720	440360	was founded on a successful one.
440360	443880	But their country was founded on one of the only successful ones.
443880	446680	Most revolutions fail, guys, you have to understand that.
447100	451460	violently turning the whole system on its head doesn't actually create anything stable?
451460	453820	I can't believe I have to be saying this.
453820	458540	And I think most people at least kind of understand this, so Bernie's revolutionary talk just
458540	460860	seems to have alienated a good chunk of the electorate.
460860	465220	I love going back to this Sky City guy, because he seems to be absolutely insane.
465220	467940	Bernie Sanders was my hero before Jeremy Corbyn.
467940	470600	He really ignited the socialist spark in me.
470600	474780	My dream would be for Corbyn and Sanders to start a transatlantic socialist movement with
474780	476380	new political parties.
476380	480160	But alas, I fear both will remain loyal to the corrupt Dems and Labour.
480160	482340	Well, Bernie's gone.
482340	483960	Jeremy Corbyn's gone.
483960	486320	Trudeau is facing some serious trouble up here.
486320	488920	Let's hope this is the end of socialism.
488920	494480	19th century economic philosophy, trying to solve industrial revolution era problems,
494480	498240	problems that have already been solved by modern capitalism, by the way, needs to stay
498240	501400	in the dustbin of history as a failed theory.
501400	506040	Leave communism and socialism in the 20th century, along with Nazism and fascism, as
506040	509340	the failed murderous experiments that they are.
509340	511980	But of course, we're going down the road of delusion again, aren't we?
511980	515980	Now that Biden's got the nomination, it seems like he's projected to win the presidency.
515980	517180	Of course he is.
517180	521980	Polling numbers show Biden with 351 delegates to Trump's 187.
521980	524900	Yeah, I'm sure this is how November 2020 will go.
524900	530060	The Dems are literally doing the exact same thing again, and they don't seem to understand
530060	534580	that at least some of Bernie's support comes from the fact that he's outside the political
534580	536720	system in the same way that Trump is.
536720	540000	15% of Sanders supporters will vote for Trump if Biden is the nominee.
540000	544780	I mean, 80 would still back Biden, but that still means that 15% of people that wanted
544780	546920	Bernie are going to go Trump instead of Biden.
546920	548740	That's not an insignificant amount.
548740	550880	And let's be honest, it's completely predictable.
550880	556600	This 2017 article from Newsweek titled, Bernie Sanders Voters Help Trump Win and Here's
556600	561680	Proof, goes through some of the stats and basically determines that 12% of Bernie supporters
561680	565500	were only supporters of Bernie because they were anti-establishment and therefore ended
565500	567420	going up Trump over Hillary.
567420	569980	It's no surprise to me that the same thing would happen to Biden.
569980	574660	Do you recall back in, I think it was 2012, maybe 2000, I think it was 2012 though, when
574660	580620	the Republicans just kept losing to Obama and Obama's mandate seemed to be quite secure.
580620	584300	It was Rachel Maddow who basically made fun of them and basically said that the Republicans
584300	588080	keep trying their old failed shtick and they keep losing.
588080	592120	Even without Florida being decided, we now know that President Obama won in pretty much
592120	595720	exactly the way the state by state polls said he was going to win.
595720	598540	He won with more than 300 electoral votes.
598540	599580	It was not magic.
599580	604860	It was just math, math that was completely invisible to the political right.
604860	606660	Yes, that's right.
606660	607660	No that's not.
607660	609180	Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
609180	612220	But Republicans and conservatives plainly really believed this stuff.
612220	615080	I mean, they were talking each other into it a little bit, but it's not like they were
615080	616400	faking it.
616400	619700	They were so, so, so, so, so, so sure they would win.
619700	624500	They were so sure that these polls must be wrong and that they must be right.
624500	629020	And when the real math of the real world came barreling out of the dark at them last night,
629020	630020	they hid from it.
630020	631540	They could not believe it.
631540	636400	Ohio really did go to President Obama last night and he really did win.
636400	638620	And he really was born in Hawaii.
638620	642540	And he really is legitimately president of the United States, again.
642540	646720	And the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make up a fake unemployment rate last month.
646720	650160	And the Congressional Research Service really can find no evidence that cutting taxes on
650160	652500	rich people grows the economy.
652500	655660	And the polls were not skewed to oversample Democrats.
655660	660320	And Nate Silver was not making up fake projections about the election to make conservatives feel
660320	661320	bad.
661320	663600	Nate Silver was doing math.
663600	665540	And climate change is real.
665540	668180	And rape really does cause pregnancy sometimes.
668180	670260	And evolution is a thing.
670260	672440	And Benghazi was an attack on us.
672440	674700	It was not a scandal by us.
674700	676820	And nobody is taking away anyone's guns.
676820	678640	And taxes have not gone up.
678640	680640	And the deficit is dropping, actually.
680640	683140	And Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.
683140	684820	And the moon landing was real.
684820	687000	And FEMA is not building concentration camps.
687000	690380	And U.N. election observers are not taking over Texas.
690380	695120	And moderate reforms of the regulations on the insurance industry and the financial services
695120	698820	industry in this country are not the same thing as communism.
698820	703700	Listen, last night was a good night for liberals and for Democrats for very obvious reasons.
703700	708060	But it was also possibly a good night for this country as a whole.
708060	711900	Because in this country, we have a two-party system in government.
711900	716400	And the idea is supposed to be that the two sides both come up with ways to confront and
716400	718840	fix the real problems facing our country.
718840	723140	They both propose possible solutions to our real problems.
723140	726060	And we debate between those possible solutions.
726060	729120	And by the process of debate, we pick the best idea.
729120	735080	That competition between good ideas from both sides about real problems in the real country
735080	738920	should result in our country having better choices, better options than if only one side
738920	741260	is really working on the hard stuff.
741260	744640	And if the Republican Party and the conservative movement and the conservative media is stuck
744640	749320	in a vacuum-sealed door-locked spin cycle of telling each other what makes them feel
749320	755720	good and denying the factual lived truth of the world, then we are all deprived as a nation
755720	762620	of the constructive debate between competing, feasible ideas about real problems.
762620	770020	Last night, the Republicans got shellacked, and they had no idea it was coming.
770020	776500	And we saw them in real time, in a real humiliating time, not believe it even as it was happening
776500	778840	to them.
778840	783600	And unless they are going to secede, they are going to have to pop the factual bubble
783600	788340	they have been so happy living inside if they do not want to get shellacked again.
788340	790340	And that will be a painful process for them, I'm sure.
790340	793900	But it will be good for the whole country, left, right, and center.
793900	795540	You guys, we're counting on you.
795540	797620	Wake up.
797620	798980	There's real problems in the world.
798980	801180	There are real, knowable facts in the world.
801180	805180	Let's accept those and talk about how we might approach our problems differently.
805180	807180	Let's move on from there.
807180	810740	If the Republican Party and the conservative movement and conservative media are forced
810740	815160	to do that by the humiliation they were dealt last night, we will all be better off as a
815160	816160	nation.
816160	819840	Now, Rachel Maddow isn't actually smart enough to understand that this is the exact
819840	822040	same thing happening to the Democrats right now.
822040	826580	Rather than four more years of stamping your feet, screaming orange man bad, talking about
826580	830000	how everyone who doesn't vote for your candidate is a racist or whatever, you need to figure
830000	833440	out what's actually going wrong, or you will keep losing.
833440	837640	The Republicans are all but guaranteed to win 2020, and if the Democrats don't have
837640	854060	some humility about this, the Republicans are going to win 2024 as well.
