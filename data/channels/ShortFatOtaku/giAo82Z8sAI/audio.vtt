WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
And so Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the race.

00:30.000 --> 00:44.920
I mean, we all saw this coming, right?

00:44.920 --> 00:49.280
I think even a lot of the Bernie bros that I follow on Twitter, they kind of saw it coming

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
too.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.540
Even if you actually believe that Bernie Sanders isn't a straight up Venezuelan-style socialist

00:54.540 --> 00:59.240
or like a tanky or something, you can't deny that his staffers certainly are.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.880
I think we've all seen the Project Veritas leaks at this point, where you've got Bernie

01:02.880 --> 01:08.600
staff simping for the Soviet Union and talking about how the Gulag was actually pretty good.

01:08.600 --> 01:26.280
Crazy stuff, man.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.620
You on head is probably the only Bernie bro that I support.

01:29.620 --> 01:35.060
Is it really a Bernie bro if it's a girl or is it just like a Bernie supporter or something?

01:35.060 --> 01:36.060
Bernie bro's catchy though.

01:36.060 --> 01:37.640
I don't know, maybe she has a penis.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.580
I don't think so, but it's the internet, so you never really know.

01:40.580 --> 01:43.960
But she's the only Bernie bro that I actually respect, at least of the ones that I've seen

01:43.960 --> 01:44.960
so far.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.740
And I do kind of get where she's coming from.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.180
For example, she says, you've changed the conversation forever.

01:50.180 --> 01:53.360
Things you were saying years ago and people were calling you crazy for are now incredibly

01:53.360 --> 01:54.360
popular.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.300
I look forward to the next election where every candidate on stage is trying to do their

01:57.300 --> 01:58.700
best Bernie impression.

01:58.700 --> 02:02.780
And I mean, fair enough, there's certainly an argument to be made for a universal health

02:02.780 --> 02:03.780
care system.

02:03.780 --> 02:06.440
That's a debate you can actually have where there's good points on both sides.

02:06.440 --> 02:09.220
And there's definitely a part of me that thinks that it's a little bit crazy that the United

02:09.220 --> 02:12.420
States doesn't have some kind of, at least a minimum standard of coverage.

02:12.420 --> 02:17.700
But at the same time, Bernie has rubbed me the wrong way, basically ever since he cucked

02:17.700 --> 02:19.940
out to Hillary in 2016.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.380
And I think I know why.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.960
Shue also said this, the first time I voted for Obama, I started off excited and proud.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.480
I didn't even know what a politic was, but I knew blue team good.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.840
I'm only a couple of years older than Shue, I think.

02:31.840 --> 02:37.720
And this definitely describes me in 2004, where it was Bush versus Kerry.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.400
John Kerry had no charisma.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.960
He had no grassroots backing.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.920
He had no viable plan for the future should he actually become president, but it was very

02:44.920 --> 02:47.800
much a blue team good situation.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.080
And back then you could definitely make the argument that the blue team was good.

02:51.080 --> 02:56.740
In 2004, the United States was still struggling with some very obvious things, like gay marriage.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.260
That's just straight up a personal freedoms issue.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.860
And the only arguments against it are religious in nature.

03:01.860 --> 03:05.340
Back during the Bush era, it was the left that stood for personal freedom, and it was

03:05.340 --> 03:09.340
the right that stood for curtailing those freedoms based on primarily religious grounds.

03:09.340 --> 03:13.820
But as I've said in the past few videos, that's not the political dynamic anymore.

03:13.820 --> 03:16.740
The old religious right has largely been swept away.

03:16.740 --> 03:20.860
The new right seems to be much more libertarian leaning, and the left has become a lot more

03:20.860 --> 03:23.640
authoritarian in the past, say, 20 years.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.320
So for me, when Obama came along, it was more than just blue team good.

03:27.320 --> 03:31.400
It was the fact that he was at least saying he was going to try something new, the whole

03:31.400 --> 03:32.860
hope and change thing.

03:32.860 --> 03:38.600
And then as Obama went through his two terms, I kind of realized that whenever a politician

03:38.600 --> 03:43.340
peddles radical change, they're almost always lying to your face.

03:43.340 --> 03:46.960
This includes Obama, and yes, it also includes Bernie.

03:46.960 --> 03:52.520
By contrast, when a politician comes in and advocates for, say, slow and steady incremental

03:52.520 --> 03:58.080
change, done imperfectly but is a small improvement day by day, not only is that a lot more believable,

03:58.080 --> 03:59.960
it's a lot more achievable.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.880
And frankly, maybe I'm just an old man at this point, but I'll take slow and steady

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
any day.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.560
Which is why I no longer have the attitude of blue team good.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.880
All of my values still align with the core of the left, as it was 20 years ago.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.460
But in terms of United States politics, it's Republicans that represent that more than

04:15.460 --> 04:16.460
Democrats now.

04:16.460 --> 04:19.980
It's very strange, but blue team good just isn't enough anymore.

04:19.980 --> 04:24.140
There's a lot of trending hashtags about it, this one here is Thank You Bernie.

04:24.140 --> 04:28.500
Of course, not all of them are positive, hashtag Biden 2020 just seems to be full of either

04:28.500 --> 04:32.520
Bernie bros complaining about it, for example, everyone ready to vote for their favorite

04:32.520 --> 04:37.760
rapist in November, or alternatively, Democratic shills going blue team good.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.820
Stop being little bitches and start campaigning.

04:39.820 --> 04:42.380
We cannot survive another four years of this shit.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.380
Really.

04:43.380 --> 04:48.800
If you dislike Trump, is the United States actually this dystopian hellscape?

04:48.800 --> 04:50.740
Things seem to be going okay down there.

04:50.740 --> 04:54.360
Of course, you've got dem exit, and you know what, I'm not surprised.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.400
If you want the DNC to learn its lesson, you are going to have to dem exit.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.140
That is just the way this goes now.

05:00.140 --> 05:04.720
You didn't do it in 2016, you still ended up cucking to Hillary, just like Bernie did,

05:04.720 --> 05:08.540
and you can't do it in 2020 if you want there to be actual change in your party.

05:08.540 --> 05:13.920
If for some ridiculous reason, you want the Democratic party to become a socialist party,

05:13.920 --> 05:18.320
you are going to have to hand them a worse defeat than they faced in 2016, because they

05:18.320 --> 05:19.940
still haven't learned the lesson.

05:19.940 --> 05:25.780
And speaking of blue team good, you also have hashtag vote blue no matter who, because it

05:25.780 --> 05:29.480
seems like both the establishment Democrats and the radical left in the United States

05:29.480 --> 05:32.400
still just haven't learned their lesson yet.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.540
Of course, it's always kind of funny to laugh at people who have completely lost their minds.

05:35.540 --> 05:39.840
Joe Biden is now US presidential nominee, meaning the Democrats can never again attack

05:39.840 --> 05:44.400
the Republicans for choosing a lying, senile, racist, war mongering sex offender.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.960
The resistance have shown themselves to be hypocrites in the most astounding way.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.960
As it turns out, the left is just as morally bankrupt as the right when the chips are down.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.720
I don't know how you can justify blue team good at this point.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
Facts.

05:57.720 --> 06:02.040
I'm mad Biden is the nominee, I 100% believe the allegations against him.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.100
I wanted someone much more progressive.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.100
Also facts.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.460
Biden or Trump will win.

06:06.460 --> 06:09.200
For progressive legislation down the road, we need blue courts.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.360
If you don't vote for Biden, you're in the way.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.080
I thought you wanted a revolution.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.560
I thought you wanted to upend the system.

06:15.560 --> 06:20.460
If you're not willing to actually burn everything down, maybe you should stop playing at it.

06:20.460 --> 06:24.220
Because do you know what it'll take to actually get the DNC to change long term?

06:24.220 --> 06:27.840
Losing so hard, they don't come back for a full generation.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.960
But it seems like you're not willing to do that because you want blue courts.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.160
Well, you're not going to get them this way.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.020
Wow, I'm heartbroken about Bernie.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.820
In all this darkness, he made me believe that people together could be the light.

06:39.820 --> 06:43.880
He continues to be an inspiration, and he'll never stop fighting for us.

06:43.880 --> 06:44.880
Thank you, Bernie.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.900
For me, you're right up there with Mr. Rogers.

06:47.900 --> 06:51.020
Sarah Silverman, you know that Bernie's not dead, right?

06:51.020 --> 06:53.540
Like most revolutionaries, you are ahead of your time.

06:53.540 --> 06:57.540
And despite resistance from the most powerful people in America, you never stop fighting

06:57.540 --> 06:58.980
for real change.

06:58.980 --> 07:02.420
You have ushered in a new progressive era, and the fight for justice will go on.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.240
As it turns out, most of the electorate doesn't want revolution.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.480
They want incremental improvement.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.400
Real change comes day by day, slowly building it.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
One brick at a time.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.720
I know Americans have this romanticism about revolutions, because, frankly, their country

07:18.720 --> 07:20.360
was founded on a successful one.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.880
But their country was founded on one of the only successful ones.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.680
Most revolutions fail, guys, you have to understand that.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.460
violently turning the whole system on its head doesn't actually create anything stable?

07:31.460 --> 07:33.820
I can't believe I have to be saying this.

07:33.820 --> 07:38.540
And I think most people at least kind of understand this, so Bernie's revolutionary talk just

07:38.540 --> 07:40.860
seems to have alienated a good chunk of the electorate.

07:40.860 --> 07:45.220
I love going back to this Sky City guy, because he seems to be absolutely insane.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.940
Bernie Sanders was my hero before Jeremy Corbyn.

07:47.940 --> 07:50.600
He really ignited the socialist spark in me.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.780
My dream would be for Corbyn and Sanders to start a transatlantic socialist movement with

07:54.780 --> 07:56.380
new political parties.

07:56.380 --> 08:00.160
But alas, I fear both will remain loyal to the corrupt Dems and Labour.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.340
Well, Bernie's gone.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.960
Jeremy Corbyn's gone.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.320
Trudeau is facing some serious trouble up here.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.920
Let's hope this is the end of socialism.

08:08.920 --> 08:14.480
19th century economic philosophy, trying to solve industrial revolution era problems,

08:14.480 --> 08:18.240
problems that have already been solved by modern capitalism, by the way, needs to stay

08:18.240 --> 08:21.400
in the dustbin of history as a failed theory.

08:21.400 --> 08:26.040
Leave communism and socialism in the 20th century, along with Nazism and fascism, as

08:26.040 --> 08:29.340
the failed murderous experiments that they are.

08:29.340 --> 08:31.980
But of course, we're going down the road of delusion again, aren't we?

08:31.980 --> 08:35.980
Now that Biden's got the nomination, it seems like he's projected to win the presidency.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.180
Of course he is.

08:37.180 --> 08:41.980
Polling numbers show Biden with 351 delegates to Trump's 187.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.900
Yeah, I'm sure this is how November 2020 will go.

08:44.900 --> 08:50.060
The Dems are literally doing the exact same thing again, and they don't seem to understand

08:50.060 --> 08:54.580
that at least some of Bernie's support comes from the fact that he's outside the political

08:54.580 --> 08:56.720
system in the same way that Trump is.

08:56.720 --> 09:00.000
15% of Sanders supporters will vote for Trump if Biden is the nominee.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.780
I mean, 80 would still back Biden, but that still means that 15% of people that wanted

09:04.780 --> 09:06.920
Bernie are going to go Trump instead of Biden.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.740
That's not an insignificant amount.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.880
And let's be honest, it's completely predictable.

09:10.880 --> 09:16.600
This 2017 article from Newsweek titled, Bernie Sanders Voters Help Trump Win and Here's

09:16.600 --> 09:21.680
Proof, goes through some of the stats and basically determines that 12% of Bernie supporters

09:21.680 --> 09:25.500
were only supporters of Bernie because they were anti-establishment and therefore ended

09:25.500 --> 09:27.420
going up Trump over Hillary.

09:27.420 --> 09:29.980
It's no surprise to me that the same thing would happen to Biden.

09:29.980 --> 09:34.660
Do you recall back in, I think it was 2012, maybe 2000, I think it was 2012 though, when

09:34.660 --> 09:40.620
the Republicans just kept losing to Obama and Obama's mandate seemed to be quite secure.

09:40.620 --> 09:44.300
It was Rachel Maddow who basically made fun of them and basically said that the Republicans

09:44.300 --> 09:48.080
keep trying their old failed shtick and they keep losing.

09:48.080 --> 09:52.120
Even without Florida being decided, we now know that President Obama won in pretty much

09:52.120 --> 09:55.720
exactly the way the state by state polls said he was going to win.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.540
He won with more than 300 electoral votes.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.580
It was not magic.

09:59.580 --> 10:04.860
It was just math, math that was completely invisible to the political right.

10:04.860 --> 10:06.660
Yes, that's right.

10:06.660 --> 10:07.660
No that's not.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.180
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

10:09.180 --> 10:12.220
But Republicans and conservatives plainly really believed this stuff.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.080
I mean, they were talking each other into it a little bit, but it's not like they were

10:15.080 --> 10:16.400
faking it.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.700
They were so, so, so, so, so, so sure they would win.

10:19.700 --> 10:24.500
They were so sure that these polls must be wrong and that they must be right.

10:24.500 --> 10:29.020
And when the real math of the real world came barreling out of the dark at them last night,

10:29.020 --> 10:30.020
they hid from it.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.540
They could not believe it.

10:31.540 --> 10:36.400
Ohio really did go to President Obama last night and he really did win.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.620
And he really was born in Hawaii.

10:38.620 --> 10:42.540
And he really is legitimately president of the United States, again.

10:42.540 --> 10:46.720
And the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make up a fake unemployment rate last month.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.160
And the Congressional Research Service really can find no evidence that cutting taxes on

10:50.160 --> 10:52.500
rich people grows the economy.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.660
And the polls were not skewed to oversample Democrats.

10:55.660 --> 11:00.320
And Nate Silver was not making up fake projections about the election to make conservatives feel

11:00.320 --> 11:01.320
bad.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.600
Nate Silver was doing math.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.540
And climate change is real.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.180
And rape really does cause pregnancy sometimes.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.260
And evolution is a thing.

11:10.260 --> 11:12.440
And Benghazi was an attack on us.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.700
It was not a scandal by us.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.820
And nobody is taking away anyone's guns.

11:16.820 --> 11:18.640
And taxes have not gone up.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.640
And the deficit is dropping, actually.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.140
And Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.820
And the moon landing was real.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.000
And FEMA is not building concentration camps.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.380
And U.N. election observers are not taking over Texas.

11:30.380 --> 11:35.120
And moderate reforms of the regulations on the insurance industry and the financial services

11:35.120 --> 11:38.820
industry in this country are not the same thing as communism.

11:38.820 --> 11:43.700
Listen, last night was a good night for liberals and for Democrats for very obvious reasons.

11:43.700 --> 11:48.060
But it was also possibly a good night for this country as a whole.

11:48.060 --> 11:51.900
Because in this country, we have a two-party system in government.

11:51.900 --> 11:56.400
And the idea is supposed to be that the two sides both come up with ways to confront and

11:56.400 --> 11:58.840
fix the real problems facing our country.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.140
They both propose possible solutions to our real problems.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.060
And we debate between those possible solutions.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.120
And by the process of debate, we pick the best idea.

12:09.120 --> 12:15.080
That competition between good ideas from both sides about real problems in the real country

12:15.080 --> 12:18.920
should result in our country having better choices, better options than if only one side

12:18.920 --> 12:21.260
is really working on the hard stuff.

12:21.260 --> 12:24.640
And if the Republican Party and the conservative movement and the conservative media is stuck

12:24.640 --> 12:29.320
in a vacuum-sealed door-locked spin cycle of telling each other what makes them feel

12:29.320 --> 12:35.720
good and denying the factual lived truth of the world, then we are all deprived as a nation

12:35.720 --> 12:42.620
of the constructive debate between competing, feasible ideas about real problems.

12:42.620 --> 12:50.020
Last night, the Republicans got shellacked, and they had no idea it was coming.

12:50.020 --> 12:56.500
And we saw them in real time, in a real humiliating time, not believe it even as it was happening

12:56.500 --> 12:58.840
to them.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.600
And unless they are going to secede, they are going to have to pop the factual bubble

13:03.600 --> 13:08.340
they have been so happy living inside if they do not want to get shellacked again.

13:08.340 --> 13:10.340
And that will be a painful process for them, I'm sure.

13:10.340 --> 13:13.900
But it will be good for the whole country, left, right, and center.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.540
You guys, we're counting on you.

13:15.540 --> 13:17.620
Wake up.

13:17.620 --> 13:18.980
There's real problems in the world.

13:18.980 --> 13:21.180
There are real, knowable facts in the world.

13:21.180 --> 13:25.180
Let's accept those and talk about how we might approach our problems differently.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.180
Let's move on from there.

13:27.180 --> 13:30.740
If the Republican Party and the conservative movement and conservative media are forced

13:30.740 --> 13:35.160
to do that by the humiliation they were dealt last night, we will all be better off as a

13:35.160 --> 13:36.160
nation.

13:36.160 --> 13:39.840
Now, Rachel Maddow isn't actually smart enough to understand that this is the exact

13:39.840 --> 13:42.040
same thing happening to the Democrats right now.

13:42.040 --> 13:46.580
Rather than four more years of stamping your feet, screaming orange man bad, talking about

13:46.580 --> 13:50.000
how everyone who doesn't vote for your candidate is a racist or whatever, you need to figure

13:50.000 --> 13:53.440
out what's actually going wrong, or you will keep losing.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.640
The Republicans are all but guaranteed to win 2020, and if the Democrats don't have

13:57.640 --> 14:14.060
some humility about this, the Republicans are going to win 2024 as well.
