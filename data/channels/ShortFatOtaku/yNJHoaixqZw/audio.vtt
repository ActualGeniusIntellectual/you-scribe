00:00.000 --> 00:09.940
Trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights are

00:09.940 --> 00:11.000
human rights.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.980
Trans people shouldn't be killed, prevented from holding a job, or renting a place.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.380
Adults should be left alone to do what they like with their bodies.

00:16.380 --> 00:19.540
There, have I virtue signaled enough to be allowed to talk about this topic?

00:19.540 --> 00:22.460
Trans women competing against cis women in professional level sports is currently the

00:22.460 --> 00:26.860
big topic of conversation online right now, because transgender swimmer Leah Thomas won

00:26.860 --> 00:29.380
the women's 500 yard NCAA title.

00:29.380 --> 00:33.320
The controversy stems from the fact that Leah Thomas swam for Penn State for three

00:33.320 --> 00:37.620
years before transitioning, then sat out one year to transition, then returned to compete

00:37.620 --> 00:38.620
as a woman.

00:38.620 --> 00:42.420
People who view Leah's inclusion in the women's division as unfair point to the fact that

00:42.420 --> 00:47.060
she went through a fully male puberty until the age of 21, and has only been on hormones

00:47.060 --> 00:51.340
for one year, giving her a physical advantage that cis women cannot hope to overcome.

00:51.340 --> 00:55.580
These people also point to the fact that Leah has been shattering women's records left and

00:55.580 --> 00:59.220
right since transitioning, and that the cis women she beat feel cheated.

00:59.220 --> 01:03.660
People who oppose this view, who are on Leah's side, point to the fact that the online outrage

01:03.660 --> 01:08.740
machine only seems to care about trans athletes when they're winning against cis athletes.

01:08.740 --> 01:12.740
That actually seems to be the case, because among all of this kerfuffle, nobody who is

01:12.740 --> 01:19.020
currently complaining about Leah has noticed that she's quietly placed 8th in the 100 yard

01:19.020 --> 01:24.380
race, and in fact, she was beat in that race by a trans man who was still required to swim

01:24.380 --> 01:28.700
in the women's league because they hadn't begun hormonally transitioning yet.

01:28.700 --> 01:33.020
But even though the online outrage machine might have a short attention span, that does

01:33.020 --> 01:37.540
not automatically disqualify their question, and that question seems to be, should trans

01:37.540 --> 01:40.780
women be competing against cis women in professional sports?

01:40.780 --> 01:43.620
It's a question that's been floating around a lot longer than Leah Thomas.

01:43.620 --> 01:49.100
This debate first flared up in 2014, when Fallon Fox, a trans woman MMA fighter, overpowered

01:49.100 --> 01:53.140
Tamika Brents so severely in a match that she suffered a broken skull.

01:53.140 --> 01:57.020
Brents later said, I've fought a lot of women, and I've never felt the strength that I felt

01:57.020 --> 01:58.380
in a fight as I did that night.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.840
I can't answer whether it's because she was born a man or not because I'm not a doctor.

02:01.840 --> 02:07.060
I can only say I've never felt so overpowered ever in my life, and I am an abnormally strong

02:07.060 --> 02:08.500
female in my own right.

02:08.500 --> 02:13.020
This does seem pretty outrageous, but like with Leah, it was ignored by those who were

02:13.020 --> 02:18.900
outraged that Fox had herself lost to a cis woman, Ashley Evans-Smith, a year prior.

02:18.900 --> 02:23.820
At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a lot of noise was made about the inclusion of trans weightlifter

02:23.820 --> 02:28.940
Laurel Hubbard, who lived as a cis male for 35 years before transitioning, with all of

02:28.940 --> 02:32.060
the advantages of a male puberty and a male adult life.

02:32.060 --> 02:36.340
Hubbard didn't compete in weightlifting at all pre-transition, but post-transition in

02:36.340 --> 02:39.980
2012, she began winning elite titles in women's divisions.

02:39.980 --> 02:45.020
However, like Leah Thomas and Fallon Fox, Hubbard quietly failed at the Tokyo Olympics,

02:45.020 --> 02:46.580
failing to place at all.

02:46.580 --> 02:50.300
And this, again, went unnoticed by the online outrage machine.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.340
While I was researching this video, I noticed that this was a trend.

02:53.340 --> 02:57.580
Every time the online right cried foul at the inclusion of a high-profile trans athlete

02:57.580 --> 03:01.940
into a women's league, it turns out that the career of that trans woman in their sport

03:01.940 --> 03:06.220
is not entirely filled with pure subjugation of every female who stands before them, or

03:06.220 --> 03:09.340
the complete and total domination of every previously held record.

03:09.340 --> 03:14.060
In fact, when that trans woman inevitably fails, because most athletes eventually do,

03:14.060 --> 03:16.580
the spotlight has already moved on and nobody notices.

03:16.580 --> 03:20.980
But this is not to say that I'm actually pro-trans women in cis women's sports.

03:20.980 --> 03:25.700
In the end, I'm not, and I can absolutely tell you why, not by appealing to the anecdotes

03:25.700 --> 03:28.980
of Laurel Hubbard, or Fallon Fox, or Leah Thomas.

03:28.980 --> 03:31.820
Instead, let's talk about something more concrete.

03:31.820 --> 03:35.940
Here is the study, Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport, Perspectives on

03:35.940 --> 03:38.180
Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.580
Let's look it over together.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.660
The study begins by describing the biological basis for sporting performance advantages

03:43.660 --> 03:46.100
in males, essentially what makes men better at sports.

03:46.100 --> 03:51.060
The study states that during puberty, testes derived testosterone levels increase 20-fold

03:51.060 --> 03:55.740
in males but remain low in females, resulting in circulating testosterone concentrations

03:55.740 --> 03:59.900
at least 15 times higher in males than in females of any age.

03:59.900 --> 04:03.660
Testosterone in males induces changes in muscle mass, strength, anthropomorphic variables

04:03.660 --> 04:07.660
and hemoglobin levels as part of the range of sexually dimorphic characteristics observed

04:07.660 --> 04:08.660
in humans.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.060
And even before puberty, this makes a difference.

04:11.060 --> 04:16.100
Some 6,500 genes are differentially expressed between males and females, with an estimated

04:16.100 --> 04:20.940
3,000 sex-specific differences in skeletal muscle likely to influence composition and

04:20.940 --> 04:28.340
function beyond the effects of androgenization, while increased testosterone during mini-puberty

04:28.340 --> 04:33.540
in males aged 1-6 months may be correlated with higher growth velocity and an imprinting

04:33.540 --> 04:35.740
effect on BMI and body weight.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.780
So in general, males are stronger than females.

04:37.780 --> 04:40.020
I don't think that's groundbreaking news to anybody.

04:40.020 --> 04:43.340
That strength plays out differently depending on what sport we're talking about, but it's

04:43.340 --> 04:44.340
always there.

04:44.340 --> 04:47.760
Here's a chart that plots the differences between the average male and female professional

04:47.760 --> 04:49.440
athletes of the same sport.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.380
All of the female athletes' averages are set to 100% for their sports that we may see

04:53.380 --> 04:56.700
how much more effective the average male athlete is at the sport.

04:56.700 --> 05:00.580
In rowing, for example, the average male athlete is only 10% more effective than the average

05:00.580 --> 05:04.300
female athlete, meaning that on a professional level, male athletes are out-rowing female

05:04.300 --> 05:06.100
athletes by an average of 10%.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.340
There's a similar range for swimming and running.

05:08.340 --> 05:12.180
Cycling, the gap increases to 16%, but as you can see, there's more variance at the

05:12.180 --> 05:13.180
top.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.380
That's what that little secondary range means.

05:14.380 --> 05:18.860
There's a similar gap hovering around 20% for jumping, kicking, tennis, golf, handball,

05:18.860 --> 05:19.860
and pole vault.

05:19.860 --> 05:25.220
The gap increases to around 30% for cricket, volleyball, long drives in golf, and weightlifting.

05:25.220 --> 05:28.220
For baseball and field hockey, the gap is 50%.

05:28.220 --> 05:32.040
I've heard a lot of trans activists make the point that it's not just biology, but also

05:32.040 --> 05:34.360
social differences in the promotion of sport.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.640
Most notably Mia Mulder, where in her video, Should a Trans Woman Be Allowed in Women's

05:38.640 --> 05:39.640
Sports?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.640
That sounds familiar.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
She says,

05:41.640 --> 05:45.680
When women began being involved in sports, sports science and other things relating to

05:45.680 --> 05:50.120
sport had not been adapted for women bodies.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.280
The entire playing field had already been made by and for men.

05:54.280 --> 06:00.320
And that's not to mention that most athletes then and even now are men, which means that

06:00.320 --> 06:05.960
when we're talking about higher level competitions, men will have more competition to even reach

06:05.960 --> 06:08.760
that stage, which will make them perform better.

06:08.760 --> 06:14.040
If you have 500 men competing in a sport and only 10 women competing in the same sport,

06:14.040 --> 06:20.240
odds are the men are going to outperform the women, even if the playing field is completely

06:20.240 --> 06:24.640
level, which means that there's basically no way for women to actually compete with

06:24.640 --> 06:27.480
men, even when there is no biological difference.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.080
And you know, that's actually a good point.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.120
If men have been playing and competing against each other for centuries and women are only

06:32.120 --> 06:36.880
just starting up, there's certainly a cumulative effect, not on any one man, but on the surrounding

06:36.880 --> 06:41.000
culture of sport, how to train, what to eat, the quality of the surrounding competition

06:41.000 --> 06:42.760
that you can train yourself against.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.880
In most cases, top level female athletes are not given the same level of consideration

06:46.880 --> 06:48.680
as top level male athletes.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.360
This again should surprise no one.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.040
But unfortunately for Mia Mulder, this study also covers that too.

06:54.040 --> 06:58.000
It is acknowledged that this divergence has been compounded historically by a lag in the

06:58.000 --> 07:03.240
cultural acceptance of and financial provision for females in sport that may have had implications

07:03.240 --> 07:05.880
for the rate of improvement in athletic performance in females.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.640
Yet since the 1990s, the difference in performance records between males and females has been

07:09.640 --> 07:13.960
relatively stable, suggesting that the biological differences created by androgenization explain

07:13.960 --> 07:16.080
most of the male advantage and are insurmountable.

07:16.080 --> 07:20.520
Oh well, it turns out, even when things are culturally constructed, the foundation that

07:20.520 --> 07:22.440
they're built atop of is biological.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.440
Who knew?

07:23.440 --> 07:26.680
Now that the study has definitively laid out that the difference between males and females

07:26.680 --> 07:31.280
in sport is primarily based in biology, it then turns its attention to trans women in

07:31.280 --> 07:32.280
sport.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.800
Is the male performance advantage lost when testosterone is suppressed in transgender

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
women?

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
Let's look at the data.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.720
Here's a chart of changes in muscle mass and strength in trans women athletes pre-testosterone

07:41.720 --> 07:45.840
suppression, as well as after at least 12 months of testosterone suppression, compared

07:45.840 --> 07:47.520
with demographically matched female athletes.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.720
Here's how you read the graph.

07:48.720 --> 07:53.200
The 0% mark on the graph is the pre-suppression location in all instances, again for easy

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
comparison.

07:54.720 --> 07:59.120
The data comes from a 2004 study and compares with 36 months on testosterone suppression,

07:59.120 --> 08:00.760
focusing on thigh muscle mass.

08:00.760 --> 08:06.480
So after the 36 months, the change was a 12% loss of thigh muscle mass in the trans athletes,

08:06.480 --> 08:10.680
which is still 13% more muscle mass than in their cis counterparts.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.880
Going down this graph, the results are damning.

08:12.880 --> 08:16.640
The amount of strength and muscle mass for these various body parts and exercises are

08:16.640 --> 08:19.280
mostly in the single digits post-testosterone.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.480
And their advantages over their cis counterparts remains huge.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.680
Here's the same data set, this time with the pre-suppression at trans figures anchored

08:26.680 --> 08:30.600
to 100%, and it also includes average male athletes.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.000
Pre-suppression at trans are the white circles, post-suppression trans are the black circles,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.960
males are diamonds, females are squares.

08:35.960 --> 08:40.640
For example, in grip strength, men were significantly stronger than both cis and trans women, but

08:40.640 --> 08:44.720
trans women were significantly stronger than cis women, and 12 months on test suppression

08:44.720 --> 08:46.640
only slightly lowered that advantage.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.720
The study concludes that strength, lean body mass, muscle size, and bone density are only

08:50.760 --> 08:52.800
trivially affected by testosterone suppression.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.880
And the reductions observed in muscle mass, size, and strength are very small compared

08:56.880 --> 09:00.120
to the baseline differences between males and females in these variables.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.600
And thus, there are major performance and safety implications in sports where these

09:03.600 --> 09:05.360
attributes are competitively significant.

09:05.360 --> 09:09.480
The data significantly undermines the delivery of fairness and safety presumed by the criteria

09:09.480 --> 09:13.680
set out in transgender inclusion policies, particularly given the stated prioritization

09:13.680 --> 09:16.440
of fairness as an overriding objective for the IOC.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.180
If those policies are intended to preserve fairness, inclusion, and the safety of biologically

09:20.620 --> 09:24.220
female athletes, sporting organizations may need to reassess their policies regarding

09:24.220 --> 09:26.280
the inclusion of transgender women.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.180
There is another study that says basically the same thing.

09:28.180 --> 09:30.940
We don't gotta pore over it because I think the point's been made, but you can check

09:30.940 --> 09:32.180
it for yourself if you want.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.420
It's called How Does Hormone Transition in Transgender Women Change Body Composition?

09:36.420 --> 09:39.620
Muscle Strength in Hemoglobin, systematic review with a focus on the implications for

09:39.620 --> 09:40.700
sport participation.

09:40.700 --> 09:45.660
Its conclusion states, in trans women, hormone therapy rapidly reduces HGB to levels seen

09:45.660 --> 09:46.760
in cisgender women.

09:46.760 --> 09:52.200
In contrast, hormone therapy decreases strength, LBM, and muscle area, yet values remain above

09:52.200 --> 09:55.360
that observed in cisgender women, even after 36 months.

09:55.360 --> 10:00.320
These findings suggest that strength may well be preserved in trans women during the first

10:00.320 --> 10:01.720
three years of hormone therapy.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.440
Okay, yes, I think it's fair to say at this point that trans women have a significant

10:05.440 --> 10:07.760
advantage against cis women in professional level sport.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.120
And like the conclusion of the previous study said, if fairness and inclusion of cis women

10:11.120 --> 10:14.600
is the goal, then the inclusion of trans women may not be compatible with that goal.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.880
Of course, some trans women athletes just don't care.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.940
In 2019, Rachel McKinnon picked up a gold medal for cycling in the 2019 Masters Track

10:20.940 --> 10:24.120
Cycling World Championships as a trans woman competing against cis women.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.940
And she had this to say about it.

10:25.940 --> 10:32.920
I'm legally and medically female, but the people who oppose my existence still want

10:32.920 --> 10:34.200
to think of me as male.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.480
They use the language of that I'm a man.

10:36.480 --> 10:41.440
And so there's this stereotype that men are always stronger than women.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.840
And so if you think of trans women as men, then you think there's an unfair advantage.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.020
Do you accept that there may still be an advantage?

10:50.020 --> 10:51.400
Is it possible?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
Yes.

10:52.400 --> 11:00.240
However, the range of body sizes and strength levels within a sport, you can be successful

11:00.240 --> 11:04.640
with massively different body compositions, even within my sport.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.880
Yeah, just straight up.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.960
It's possible I have an advantage because I'm biologically male, but I'll just hand

11:08.960 --> 11:11.480
wave that with, oh, there's all sorts of body types.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.480
It's bullshit.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.440
We all know that you're just muddying the waters because you have a gold medal that

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
you want to keep.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.440
We get it.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.740
And then there's cases of trans women who have not yet medically transitioned or whose

11:20.740 --> 11:22.340
transition status is unknown.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.040
And despite that, they run against cis women anyway.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.240
That's just BS.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.860
Medically, in terms of physical fitness, not their identity or how they view themselves,

11:29.860 --> 11:31.680
they are on par with cis men.

11:31.680 --> 11:36.200
They're biologically males with either no testosterone suppression or no lasting effects

11:36.200 --> 11:37.960
from newly begun suppression.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.720
This is purely ridiculous.

11:39.720 --> 11:43.540
There's a lot of arguments from trans activists to try and counter all of this stuff.

11:43.540 --> 11:46.440
A lot of them are summarized in Mia Mulder's video, but not all of them.

11:46.440 --> 11:50.080
For example, Caster Semenya is often brought up, the runner from South Africa who turned

11:50.080 --> 11:51.880
out to be intersex, but she didn't know it.

11:51.880 --> 11:55.040
That fact was discovered after she had been running professionally in shattering records

11:55.040 --> 11:58.320
and the league ended up testing her to see if she was using steroids or had some kind

11:58.320 --> 11:59.320
of medical condition.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.760
The media in South Africa treated Semenya quite poorly once it came out that she had

12:02.760 --> 12:07.200
naturally elevated levels of testosterone due to the presence of internal testes, aka

12:07.200 --> 12:10.520
balls inside her body where her ovaries should be, despite outwardly completely appearing

12:10.520 --> 12:11.520
to be female.

12:11.520 --> 12:16.420
In 2019, citing Semenya's case, new world athletics rules came into force stating that

12:16.420 --> 12:20.900
people like Semenya would have to take testosterone suppressants to compete in women's leagues.

12:20.900 --> 12:25.320
It may give trans activists a lot of moral weight to appeal to the terrible way in which

12:25.320 --> 12:29.280
Semenya was treated, having this fact about herself that she didn't even know outed publicly

12:29.280 --> 12:30.420
and humiliatingly.

12:30.420 --> 12:31.420
And yeah, fair enough.

12:31.420 --> 12:35.640
But that doesn't actually bolster any arguments regarding trans women in sports, because Semenya

12:35.640 --> 12:40.760
isn't trans, intersex isn't trans, trans isn't intersex, and the way the trans community

12:40.760 --> 12:45.240
appropriates intersex issues to prop up their own arguments is honestly pretty disgusting.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.320
Desiring to transition because you have gender dysphoria and being born with a genital deformation

12:49.320 --> 12:53.360
that causes abnormal hormonal effects are not the same thing despite the possibility

12:53.360 --> 12:55.200
for some overlap.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.920
Arguments like Rachel McKinnon's are brought up, that it's all just different body types

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
and who cares.

12:58.920 --> 13:02.640
The downstream conclusion from that position comes with multiple suggestions, each with

13:02.640 --> 13:03.840
their own problems.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.380
For example, rather than differentiating males from females, why don't we differentiate

13:07.380 --> 13:09.060
based on weight or height class?

13:09.060 --> 13:12.840
The issue there being that males would dominate almost every single one of those classes in

13:12.840 --> 13:14.080
every single sport.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.380
Another suggestion is that we differentiate based on various hormone levels, but as the

13:17.380 --> 13:20.980
studies that we've talked about today show, that doesn't actually equalize the playing

13:20.980 --> 13:21.980
field.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.880
The male puberty is still a problem.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.960
The counter to that complaint, the it doesn't equalize the playing field one, is often for

13:27.960 --> 13:30.040
the trans activist to bring up Michael Phelps.

13:30.040 --> 13:34.000
He does actually have a genetic abnormality, giving him an abnormally long wingspan.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.160
I still find it funny it's called a wingspan on humans.

13:36.160 --> 13:39.740
As well as another abnormality concerning the build up of lactic acid in his muscles,

13:39.740 --> 13:40.740
giving him more stamina.

13:40.740 --> 13:44.000
Clearly, these genetic differences make it unfair for regular males to compete against

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
him, right?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
So why is he included?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.360
And you know, fair enough, but ultimately sport is about competition, it's about finding

13:49.360 --> 13:50.360
the best athlete.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.800
So, by what metric do we decide where a line should be drawn?

13:52.800 --> 13:56.440
The natural end result of this is saying, fuck it, there's no metrics, there's no sex

13:56.440 --> 13:59.640
classes, there's no weight or height classes, all genetic abnormalities are allowed, it

13:59.640 --> 14:01.120
will just be a free for all.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.280
And fine, fair enough, you can do that, but that means that cis males will win every single

14:05.280 --> 14:06.680
sporting competition ever.

14:06.680 --> 14:11.240
In other words, when TERFs say something like, they want to take away women's spaces, in

14:11.240 --> 14:15.120
this instance, if we followed the logic to its natural conclusion, the TERFs would actually

14:15.120 --> 14:16.120
be correct.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.560
We would be taking away that biologically female, the cis women's sporting space, and

14:20.560 --> 14:24.280
in many instances, we would also be taking away trans women's sporting spaces as well.

14:24.280 --> 14:28.000
And if you're more on the pro-trans side of things, listening to this, thinking, nah,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.480
no way, that's just hyperbole.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.920
There's no way that any trans activist thinks that.

14:31.920 --> 14:36.440
Here is a trans activist saying exactly that on a panel on this topic from just a few days

14:36.440 --> 14:37.440
ago.

14:37.440 --> 14:43.800
I think Wine Moms' like, essentially idea of a ranking system based on skill is completely

14:43.800 --> 14:52.200
fine, and that you have classes for like the 800 to 1,600 to 799, shit like that, sounds

14:52.200 --> 14:54.140
completely reasonable to me.

14:54.140 --> 15:00.900
And if it eliminates women's spaces from sports, and makes it so that, I mean, keep

15:00.900 --> 15:05.700
in mind, it'd be eliminating men's spaces from sports as well, and I have absolutely

15:05.700 --> 15:08.340
no issue with that.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.740
The TERFs are completely right.

15:09.740 --> 15:15.540
I do want to actually get rid of gendered spaces in the sports arena, and that they

15:15.540 --> 15:16.920
are 100% right.

15:16.920 --> 15:22.420
And I don't base my opinions off of what the most radical TERFs, you know, fear that I'm

15:22.420 --> 15:23.460
going to do.

15:23.460 --> 15:27.400
So to me, this open it all up solution seems to be completely untenable.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.620
The reason that we have women's sport is because generally women can't compete with men, and

15:31.620 --> 15:35.040
so they have a place where they can play with people who are generally on their own level.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.780
It's so funny to hear Prague say shit like, we can't implement blind hiring practices

15:38.780 --> 15:41.580
because not enough black people will get hired if you just leave it down to qualifications.

15:41.580 --> 15:45.800
We need diversity hires, but then they completely 180 on that logic when it comes to women in

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
sport.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.620
What they want will literally lead to a huge population, cis women, being not represented

15:50.620 --> 15:52.820
at all in almost any physical arena.

15:52.860 --> 15:56.540
Putting trans women into women's leagues, frankly seems unfair to cis women.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.920
Not only that, but those same rules mean that trans men will never be able to outcompete

15:59.920 --> 16:03.940
cis men at sport, something that trans activists never actually think about because trans men

16:03.940 --> 16:06.740
also lack the advantages of that male puberty.

16:06.740 --> 16:09.720
No matter what, somebody is getting excluded here.

16:09.720 --> 16:13.980
My preferred solution is to create trans men and trans women's leagues of their own.

16:13.980 --> 16:17.420
If you go back to that study that I talked about before and look at that graph that averaged

16:17.420 --> 16:21.620
the differences of all the measurements, you will see that the gap between men and post

16:21.620 --> 16:25.900
suppression trans women is similar to the gap between trans women and cis women.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.780
They are clearly their own classification sports-wise.

16:28.780 --> 16:32.980
The common trans activist counterargument to this is that there's so few trans women

16:32.980 --> 16:36.220
they'd never actually be able to form a league, and yeah, that unfortunately also

16:36.220 --> 16:39.620
seems to be true, but it is still the least bad option.

16:39.620 --> 16:43.800
Having cis men destroy trans women or having trans women destroy cis women seems to be

16:43.800 --> 16:46.620
erasing a population from sport entirely.

16:46.620 --> 16:50.780
Abolishing categories might appeal to that socialist or anarchist spirit on the left,

16:50.780 --> 16:53.020
but it does the same thing in reality.

16:53.020 --> 16:57.860
The least bad option is trans-specific sports leagues, where they may compete on a relatively

16:57.860 --> 16:59.980
even playing field with other athletes.

16:59.980 --> 17:03.660
If women's leagues can become more popular over time and play catch-up with the men's

17:03.660 --> 17:06.060
leagues, then surely trans women's leagues can too.
