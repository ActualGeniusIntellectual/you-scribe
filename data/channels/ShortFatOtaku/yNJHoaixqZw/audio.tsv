0	9940	Trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights are
9940	11000	human rights.
11000	13980	Trans people shouldn't be killed, prevented from holding a job, or renting a place.
13980	16380	Adults should be left alone to do what they like with their bodies.
16380	19540	There, have I virtue signaled enough to be allowed to talk about this topic?
19540	22460	Trans women competing against cis women in professional level sports is currently the
22460	26860	big topic of conversation online right now, because transgender swimmer Leah Thomas won
26860	29380	the women's 500 yard NCAA title.
29380	33320	The controversy stems from the fact that Leah Thomas swam for Penn State for three
33320	37620	years before transitioning, then sat out one year to transition, then returned to compete
37620	38620	as a woman.
38620	42420	People who view Leah's inclusion in the women's division as unfair point to the fact that
42420	47060	she went through a fully male puberty until the age of 21, and has only been on hormones
47060	51340	for one year, giving her a physical advantage that cis women cannot hope to overcome.
51340	55580	These people also point to the fact that Leah has been shattering women's records left and
55580	59220	right since transitioning, and that the cis women she beat feel cheated.
59220	63660	People who oppose this view, who are on Leah's side, point to the fact that the online outrage
63660	68740	machine only seems to care about trans athletes when they're winning against cis athletes.
68740	72740	That actually seems to be the case, because among all of this kerfuffle, nobody who is
72740	79020	currently complaining about Leah has noticed that she's quietly placed 8th in the 100 yard
79020	84380	race, and in fact, she was beat in that race by a trans man who was still required to swim
84380	88700	in the women's league because they hadn't begun hormonally transitioning yet.
88700	93020	But even though the online outrage machine might have a short attention span, that does
93020	97540	not automatically disqualify their question, and that question seems to be, should trans
97540	100780	women be competing against cis women in professional sports?
100780	103620	It's a question that's been floating around a lot longer than Leah Thomas.
103620	109100	This debate first flared up in 2014, when Fallon Fox, a trans woman MMA fighter, overpowered
109100	113140	Tamika Brents so severely in a match that she suffered a broken skull.
113140	117020	Brents later said, I've fought a lot of women, and I've never felt the strength that I felt
117020	118380	in a fight as I did that night.
118380	121840	I can't answer whether it's because she was born a man or not because I'm not a doctor.
121840	127060	I can only say I've never felt so overpowered ever in my life, and I am an abnormally strong
127060	128500	female in my own right.
128500	133020	This does seem pretty outrageous, but like with Leah, it was ignored by those who were
133020	138900	outraged that Fox had herself lost to a cis woman, Ashley Evans-Smith, a year prior.
138900	143820	At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a lot of noise was made about the inclusion of trans weightlifter
143820	148940	Laurel Hubbard, who lived as a cis male for 35 years before transitioning, with all of
148940	152060	the advantages of a male puberty and a male adult life.
152060	156340	Hubbard didn't compete in weightlifting at all pre-transition, but post-transition in
156340	159980	2012, she began winning elite titles in women's divisions.
159980	165020	However, like Leah Thomas and Fallon Fox, Hubbard quietly failed at the Tokyo Olympics,
165020	166580	failing to place at all.
166580	170300	And this, again, went unnoticed by the online outrage machine.
170300	173340	While I was researching this video, I noticed that this was a trend.
173340	177580	Every time the online right cried foul at the inclusion of a high-profile trans athlete
177580	181940	into a women's league, it turns out that the career of that trans woman in their sport
181940	186220	is not entirely filled with pure subjugation of every female who stands before them, or
186220	189340	the complete and total domination of every previously held record.
189340	194060	In fact, when that trans woman inevitably fails, because most athletes eventually do,
194060	196580	the spotlight has already moved on and nobody notices.
196580	200980	But this is not to say that I'm actually pro-trans women in cis women's sports.
200980	205700	In the end, I'm not, and I can absolutely tell you why, not by appealing to the anecdotes
205700	208980	of Laurel Hubbard, or Fallon Fox, or Leah Thomas.
208980	211820	Instead, let's talk about something more concrete.
211820	215940	Here is the study, Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport, Perspectives on
215940	218180	Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage.
218180	219580	Let's look it over together.
219580	223660	The study begins by describing the biological basis for sporting performance advantages
223660	226100	in males, essentially what makes men better at sports.
226100	231060	The study states that during puberty, testes derived testosterone levels increase 20-fold
231060	235740	in males but remain low in females, resulting in circulating testosterone concentrations
235740	239900	at least 15 times higher in males than in females of any age.
239900	243660	Testosterone in males induces changes in muscle mass, strength, anthropomorphic variables
243660	247660	and hemoglobin levels as part of the range of sexually dimorphic characteristics observed
247660	248660	in humans.
248660	251060	And even before puberty, this makes a difference.
251060	256100	Some 6,500 genes are differentially expressed between males and females, with an estimated
256100	260940	3,000 sex-specific differences in skeletal muscle likely to influence composition and
260940	268340	function beyond the effects of androgenization, while increased testosterone during mini-puberty
268340	273540	in males aged 1-6 months may be correlated with higher growth velocity and an imprinting
273540	275740	effect on BMI and body weight.
275740	277780	So in general, males are stronger than females.
277780	280020	I don't think that's groundbreaking news to anybody.
280020	283340	That strength plays out differently depending on what sport we're talking about, but it's
283340	284340	always there.
284340	287760	Here's a chart that plots the differences between the average male and female professional
287760	289440	athletes of the same sport.
289440	293380	All of the female athletes' averages are set to 100% for their sports that we may see
293380	296700	how much more effective the average male athlete is at the sport.
296700	300580	In rowing, for example, the average male athlete is only 10% more effective than the average
300580	304300	female athlete, meaning that on a professional level, male athletes are out-rowing female
304300	306100	athletes by an average of 10%.
306100	308340	There's a similar range for swimming and running.
308340	312180	Cycling, the gap increases to 16%, but as you can see, there's more variance at the
312180	313180	top.
313180	314380	That's what that little secondary range means.
314380	318860	There's a similar gap hovering around 20% for jumping, kicking, tennis, golf, handball,
318860	319860	and pole vault.
319860	325220	The gap increases to around 30% for cricket, volleyball, long drives in golf, and weightlifting.
325220	328220	For baseball and field hockey, the gap is 50%.
328220	332040	I've heard a lot of trans activists make the point that it's not just biology, but also
332040	334360	social differences in the promotion of sport.
334360	338640	Most notably Mia Mulder, where in her video, Should a Trans Woman Be Allowed in Women's
338640	339640	Sports?
339640	340640	That sounds familiar.
340640	341640	She says,
341640	345680	When women began being involved in sports, sports science and other things relating to
345680	350120	sport had not been adapted for women bodies.
350120	354280	The entire playing field had already been made by and for men.
354280	360320	And that's not to mention that most athletes then and even now are men, which means that
360320	365960	when we're talking about higher level competitions, men will have more competition to even reach
365960	368760	that stage, which will make them perform better.
368760	374040	If you have 500 men competing in a sport and only 10 women competing in the same sport,
374040	380240	odds are the men are going to outperform the women, even if the playing field is completely
380240	384640	level, which means that there's basically no way for women to actually compete with
384640	387480	men, even when there is no biological difference.
387480	389080	And you know, that's actually a good point.
389120	392120	If men have been playing and competing against each other for centuries and women are only
392120	396880	just starting up, there's certainly a cumulative effect, not on any one man, but on the surrounding
396880	401000	culture of sport, how to train, what to eat, the quality of the surrounding competition
401000	402760	that you can train yourself against.
402760	406880	In most cases, top level female athletes are not given the same level of consideration
406880	408680	as top level male athletes.
408680	410360	This again should surprise no one.
410360	414040	But unfortunately for Mia Mulder, this study also covers that too.
414040	418000	It is acknowledged that this divergence has been compounded historically by a lag in the
418000	423240	cultural acceptance of and financial provision for females in sport that may have had implications
423240	425880	for the rate of improvement in athletic performance in females.
425880	429640	Yet since the 1990s, the difference in performance records between males and females has been
429640	433960	relatively stable, suggesting that the biological differences created by androgenization explain
433960	436080	most of the male advantage and are insurmountable.
436080	440520	Oh well, it turns out, even when things are culturally constructed, the foundation that
440520	442440	they're built atop of is biological.
442440	443440	Who knew?
443440	446680	Now that the study has definitively laid out that the difference between males and females
446680	451280	in sport is primarily based in biology, it then turns its attention to trans women in
451280	452280	sport.
452280	455800	Is the male performance advantage lost when testosterone is suppressed in transgender
455800	456800	women?
456800	457800	Let's look at the data.
457800	461720	Here's a chart of changes in muscle mass and strength in trans women athletes pre-testosterone
461720	465840	suppression, as well as after at least 12 months of testosterone suppression, compared
465840	467520	with demographically matched female athletes.
467520	468720	Here's how you read the graph.
468720	473200	The 0% mark on the graph is the pre-suppression location in all instances, again for easy
473200	474200	comparison.
474720	479120	The data comes from a 2004 study and compares with 36 months on testosterone suppression,
479120	480760	focusing on thigh muscle mass.
480760	486480	So after the 36 months, the change was a 12% loss of thigh muscle mass in the trans athletes,
486480	490680	which is still 13% more muscle mass than in their cis counterparts.
490680	492880	Going down this graph, the results are damning.
492880	496640	The amount of strength and muscle mass for these various body parts and exercises are
496640	499280	mostly in the single digits post-testosterone.
499280	502480	And their advantages over their cis counterparts remains huge.
502960	506680	Here's the same data set, this time with the pre-suppression at trans figures anchored
506680	510600	to 100%, and it also includes average male athletes.
510600	514000	Pre-suppression at trans are the white circles, post-suppression trans are the black circles,
514000	515960	males are diamonds, females are squares.
515960	520640	For example, in grip strength, men were significantly stronger than both cis and trans women, but
520640	524720	trans women were significantly stronger than cis women, and 12 months on test suppression
524720	526640	only slightly lowered that advantage.
526640	530720	The study concludes that strength, lean body mass, muscle size, and bone density are only
530760	532800	trivially affected by testosterone suppression.
532800	536880	And the reductions observed in muscle mass, size, and strength are very small compared
536880	540120	to the baseline differences between males and females in these variables.
540120	543600	And thus, there are major performance and safety implications in sports where these
543600	545360	attributes are competitively significant.
545360	549480	The data significantly undermines the delivery of fairness and safety presumed by the criteria
549480	553680	set out in transgender inclusion policies, particularly given the stated prioritization
553680	556440	of fairness as an overriding objective for the IOC.
556440	560180	If those policies are intended to preserve fairness, inclusion, and the safety of biologically
560620	564220	female athletes, sporting organizations may need to reassess their policies regarding
564220	566280	the inclusion of transgender women.
566280	568180	There is another study that says basically the same thing.
568180	570940	We don't gotta pore over it because I think the point's been made, but you can check
570940	572180	it for yourself if you want.
572180	576420	It's called How Does Hormone Transition in Transgender Women Change Body Composition?
576420	579620	Muscle Strength in Hemoglobin, systematic review with a focus on the implications for
579620	580700	sport participation.
580700	585660	Its conclusion states, in trans women, hormone therapy rapidly reduces HGB to levels seen
585660	586760	in cisgender women.
586760	592200	In contrast, hormone therapy decreases strength, LBM, and muscle area, yet values remain above
592200	595360	that observed in cisgender women, even after 36 months.
595360	600320	These findings suggest that strength may well be preserved in trans women during the first
600320	601720	three years of hormone therapy.
601720	605440	Okay, yes, I think it's fair to say at this point that trans women have a significant
605440	607760	advantage against cis women in professional level sport.
607760	611120	And like the conclusion of the previous study said, if fairness and inclusion of cis women
611120	614600	is the goal, then the inclusion of trans women may not be compatible with that goal.
614600	616880	Of course, some trans women athletes just don't care.
616880	620940	In 2019, Rachel McKinnon picked up a gold medal for cycling in the 2019 Masters Track
620940	624120	Cycling World Championships as a trans woman competing against cis women.
624120	625940	And she had this to say about it.
625940	632920	I'm legally and medically female, but the people who oppose my existence still want
632920	634200	to think of me as male.
634200	636480	They use the language of that I'm a man.
636480	641440	And so there's this stereotype that men are always stronger than women.
641440	645840	And so if you think of trans women as men, then you think there's an unfair advantage.
645840	650020	Do you accept that there may still be an advantage?
650020	651400	Is it possible?
651400	652400	Yes.
652400	660240	However, the range of body sizes and strength levels within a sport, you can be successful
660240	664640	with massively different body compositions, even within my sport.
664640	665880	Yeah, just straight up.
665880	668960	It's possible I have an advantage because I'm biologically male, but I'll just hand
668960	671480	wave that with, oh, there's all sorts of body types.
671480	672480	It's bullshit.
672480	675440	We all know that you're just muddying the waters because you have a gold medal that
675440	676440	you want to keep.
676440	677440	We get it.
677440	680740	And then there's cases of trans women who have not yet medically transitioned or whose
680740	682340	transition status is unknown.
682340	685040	And despite that, they run against cis women anyway.
685040	686240	That's just BS.
686240	689860	Medically, in terms of physical fitness, not their identity or how they view themselves,
689860	691680	they are on par with cis men.
691680	696200	They're biologically males with either no testosterone suppression or no lasting effects
696200	697960	from newly begun suppression.
697960	699720	This is purely ridiculous.
699720	703540	There's a lot of arguments from trans activists to try and counter all of this stuff.
703540	706440	A lot of them are summarized in Mia Mulder's video, but not all of them.
706440	710080	For example, Caster Semenya is often brought up, the runner from South Africa who turned
710080	711880	out to be intersex, but she didn't know it.
711880	715040	That fact was discovered after she had been running professionally in shattering records
715040	718320	and the league ended up testing her to see if she was using steroids or had some kind
718320	719320	of medical condition.
719320	722760	The media in South Africa treated Semenya quite poorly once it came out that she had
722760	727200	naturally elevated levels of testosterone due to the presence of internal testes, aka
727200	730520	balls inside her body where her ovaries should be, despite outwardly completely appearing
730520	731520	to be female.
731520	736420	In 2019, citing Semenya's case, new world athletics rules came into force stating that
736420	740900	people like Semenya would have to take testosterone suppressants to compete in women's leagues.
740900	745320	It may give trans activists a lot of moral weight to appeal to the terrible way in which
745320	749280	Semenya was treated, having this fact about herself that she didn't even know outed publicly
749280	750420	and humiliatingly.
750420	751420	And yeah, fair enough.
751420	755640	But that doesn't actually bolster any arguments regarding trans women in sports, because Semenya
755640	760760	isn't trans, intersex isn't trans, trans isn't intersex, and the way the trans community
760760	765240	appropriates intersex issues to prop up their own arguments is honestly pretty disgusting.
765240	769320	Desiring to transition because you have gender dysphoria and being born with a genital deformation
769320	773360	that causes abnormal hormonal effects are not the same thing despite the possibility
773360	775200	for some overlap.
775200	777920	Arguments like Rachel McKinnon's are brought up, that it's all just different body types
777920	778920	and who cares.
778920	782640	The downstream conclusion from that position comes with multiple suggestions, each with
782640	783840	their own problems.
783840	787380	For example, rather than differentiating males from females, why don't we differentiate
787380	789060	based on weight or height class?
789060	792840	The issue there being that males would dominate almost every single one of those classes in
792840	794080	every single sport.
794080	797380	Another suggestion is that we differentiate based on various hormone levels, but as the
797380	800980	studies that we've talked about today show, that doesn't actually equalize the playing
800980	801980	field.
801980	803880	The male puberty is still a problem.
803880	807960	The counter to that complaint, the it doesn't equalize the playing field one, is often for
807960	810040	the trans activist to bring up Michael Phelps.
810040	814000	He does actually have a genetic abnormality, giving him an abnormally long wingspan.
814000	816160	I still find it funny it's called a wingspan on humans.
816160	819740	As well as another abnormality concerning the build up of lactic acid in his muscles,
819740	820740	giving him more stamina.
820740	824000	Clearly, these genetic differences make it unfair for regular males to compete against
824000	825000	him, right?
825000	826000	So why is he included?
826000	829360	And you know, fair enough, but ultimately sport is about competition, it's about finding
829360	830360	the best athlete.
830360	832800	So, by what metric do we decide where a line should be drawn?
832800	836440	The natural end result of this is saying, fuck it, there's no metrics, there's no sex
836440	839640	classes, there's no weight or height classes, all genetic abnormalities are allowed, it
839640	841120	will just be a free for all.
841120	845280	And fine, fair enough, you can do that, but that means that cis males will win every single
845280	846680	sporting competition ever.
846680	851240	In other words, when TERFs say something like, they want to take away women's spaces, in
851240	855120	this instance, if we followed the logic to its natural conclusion, the TERFs would actually
855120	856120	be correct.
856120	860560	We would be taking away that biologically female, the cis women's sporting space, and
860560	864280	in many instances, we would also be taking away trans women's sporting spaces as well.
864280	868000	And if you're more on the pro-trans side of things, listening to this, thinking, nah,
868000	869480	no way, that's just hyperbole.
869480	871920	There's no way that any trans activist thinks that.
871920	876440	Here is a trans activist saying exactly that on a panel on this topic from just a few days
876440	877440	ago.
877440	883800	I think Wine Moms' like, essentially idea of a ranking system based on skill is completely
883800	892200	fine, and that you have classes for like the 800 to 1,600 to 799, shit like that, sounds
892200	894140	completely reasonable to me.
894140	900900	And if it eliminates women's spaces from sports, and makes it so that, I mean, keep
900900	905700	in mind, it'd be eliminating men's spaces from sports as well, and I have absolutely
905700	908340	no issue with that.
908340	909740	The TERFs are completely right.
909740	915540	I do want to actually get rid of gendered spaces in the sports arena, and that they
915540	916920	are 100% right.
916920	922420	And I don't base my opinions off of what the most radical TERFs, you know, fear that I'm
922420	923460	going to do.
923460	927400	So to me, this open it all up solution seems to be completely untenable.
927400	931620	The reason that we have women's sport is because generally women can't compete with men, and
931620	935040	so they have a place where they can play with people who are generally on their own level.
935040	938780	It's so funny to hear Prague say shit like, we can't implement blind hiring practices
938780	941580	because not enough black people will get hired if you just leave it down to qualifications.
941580	945800	We need diversity hires, but then they completely 180 on that logic when it comes to women in
945800	946800	sport.
946800	950620	What they want will literally lead to a huge population, cis women, being not represented
950620	952820	at all in almost any physical arena.
952860	956540	Putting trans women into women's leagues, frankly seems unfair to cis women.
956540	959920	Not only that, but those same rules mean that trans men will never be able to outcompete
959920	963940	cis men at sport, something that trans activists never actually think about because trans men
963940	966740	also lack the advantages of that male puberty.
966740	969720	No matter what, somebody is getting excluded here.
969720	973980	My preferred solution is to create trans men and trans women's leagues of their own.
973980	977420	If you go back to that study that I talked about before and look at that graph that averaged
977420	981620	the differences of all the measurements, you will see that the gap between men and post
981620	985900	suppression trans women is similar to the gap between trans women and cis women.
985900	988780	They are clearly their own classification sports-wise.
988780	992980	The common trans activist counterargument to this is that there's so few trans women
992980	996220	they'd never actually be able to form a league, and yeah, that unfortunately also
996220	999620	seems to be true, but it is still the least bad option.
999620	1003800	Having cis men destroy trans women or having trans women destroy cis women seems to be
1003800	1006620	erasing a population from sport entirely.
1006620	1010780	Abolishing categories might appeal to that socialist or anarchist spirit on the left,
1010780	1013020	but it does the same thing in reality.
1013020	1017860	The least bad option is trans-specific sports leagues, where they may compete on a relatively
1017860	1019980	even playing field with other athletes.
1019980	1023660	If women's leagues can become more popular over time and play catch-up with the men's
1023660	1026060	leagues, then surely trans women's leagues can too.
