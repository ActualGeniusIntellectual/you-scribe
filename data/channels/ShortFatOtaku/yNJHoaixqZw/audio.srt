1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,940
Trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights, trans rights are

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,000
human rights.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,980
Trans people shouldn't be killed, prevented from holding a job, or renting a place.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,380
Adults should be left alone to do what they like with their bodies.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,540
There, have I virtue signaled enough to be allowed to talk about this topic?

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,460
Trans women competing against cis women in professional level sports is currently the

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,860
big topic of conversation online right now, because transgender swimmer Leah Thomas won

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,380
the women's 500 yard NCAA title.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,320
The controversy stems from the fact that Leah Thomas swam for Penn State for three

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,620
years before transitioning, then sat out one year to transition, then returned to compete

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,620
as a woman.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,420
People who view Leah's inclusion in the women's division as unfair point to the fact that

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,060
she went through a fully male puberty until the age of 21, and has only been on hormones

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,340
for one year, giving her a physical advantage that cis women cannot hope to overcome.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,580
These people also point to the fact that Leah has been shattering women's records left and

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,220
right since transitioning, and that the cis women she beat feel cheated.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,660
People who oppose this view, who are on Leah's side, point to the fact that the online outrage

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,740
machine only seems to care about trans athletes when they're winning against cis athletes.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,740
That actually seems to be the case, because among all of this kerfuffle, nobody who is

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,020
currently complaining about Leah has noticed that she's quietly placed 8th in the 100 yard

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,380
race, and in fact, she was beat in that race by a trans man who was still required to swim

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,700
in the women's league because they hadn't begun hormonally transitioning yet.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,020
But even though the online outrage machine might have a short attention span, that does

24
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,540
not automatically disqualify their question, and that question seems to be, should trans

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,780
women be competing against cis women in professional sports?

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,620
It's a question that's been floating around a lot longer than Leah Thomas.

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,100
This debate first flared up in 2014, when Fallon Fox, a trans woman MMA fighter, overpowered

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,140
Tamika Brents so severely in a match that she suffered a broken skull.

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,020
Brents later said, I've fought a lot of women, and I've never felt the strength that I felt

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,380
in a fight as I did that night.

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,840
I can't answer whether it's because she was born a man or not because I'm not a doctor.

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,060
I can only say I've never felt so overpowered ever in my life, and I am an abnormally strong

33
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,500
female in my own right.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,020
This does seem pretty outrageous, but like with Leah, it was ignored by those who were

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,900
outraged that Fox had herself lost to a cis woman, Ashley Evans-Smith, a year prior.

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,820
At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a lot of noise was made about the inclusion of trans weightlifter

37
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,940
Laurel Hubbard, who lived as a cis male for 35 years before transitioning, with all of

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,060
the advantages of a male puberty and a male adult life.

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,340
Hubbard didn't compete in weightlifting at all pre-transition, but post-transition in

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,980
2012, she began winning elite titles in women's divisions.

41
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,020
However, like Leah Thomas and Fallon Fox, Hubbard quietly failed at the Tokyo Olympics,

42
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,580
failing to place at all.

43
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,300
And this, again, went unnoticed by the online outrage machine.

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,340
While I was researching this video, I noticed that this was a trend.

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,580
Every time the online right cried foul at the inclusion of a high-profile trans athlete

46
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,940
into a women's league, it turns out that the career of that trans woman in their sport

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,220
is not entirely filled with pure subjugation of every female who stands before them, or

48
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,340
the complete and total domination of every previously held record.

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,060
In fact, when that trans woman inevitably fails, because most athletes eventually do,

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,580
the spotlight has already moved on and nobody notices.

51
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,980
But this is not to say that I'm actually pro-trans women in cis women's sports.

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,700
In the end, I'm not, and I can absolutely tell you why, not by appealing to the anecdotes

53
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,980
of Laurel Hubbard, or Fallon Fox, or Leah Thomas.

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,820
Instead, let's talk about something more concrete.

55
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,940
Here is the study, Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport, Perspectives on

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,180
Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage.

57
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,580
Let's look it over together.

58
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,660
The study begins by describing the biological basis for sporting performance advantages

59
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,100
in males, essentially what makes men better at sports.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,060
The study states that during puberty, testes derived testosterone levels increase 20-fold

61
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,740
in males but remain low in females, resulting in circulating testosterone concentrations

62
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,900
at least 15 times higher in males than in females of any age.

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,660
Testosterone in males induces changes in muscle mass, strength, anthropomorphic variables

64
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,660
and hemoglobin levels as part of the range of sexually dimorphic characteristics observed

65
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
in humans.

66
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,060
And even before puberty, this makes a difference.

67
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,100
Some 6,500 genes are differentially expressed between males and females, with an estimated

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,940
3,000 sex-specific differences in skeletal muscle likely to influence composition and

69
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,340
function beyond the effects of androgenization, while increased testosterone during mini-puberty

70
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,540
in males aged 1-6 months may be correlated with higher growth velocity and an imprinting

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,740
effect on BMI and body weight.

72
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,780
So in general, males are stronger than females.

73
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,020
I don't think that's groundbreaking news to anybody.

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,340
That strength plays out differently depending on what sport we're talking about, but it's

75
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
always there.

76
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,760
Here's a chart that plots the differences between the average male and female professional

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,440
athletes of the same sport.

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,380
All of the female athletes' averages are set to 100% for their sports that we may see

79
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,700
how much more effective the average male athlete is at the sport.

80
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,580
In rowing, for example, the average male athlete is only 10% more effective than the average

81
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,300
female athlete, meaning that on a professional level, male athletes are out-rowing female

82
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,100
athletes by an average of 10%.

83
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,340
There's a similar range for swimming and running.

84
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,180
Cycling, the gap increases to 16%, but as you can see, there's more variance at the

85
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,180
top.

86
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,380
That's what that little secondary range means.

87
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,860
There's a similar gap hovering around 20% for jumping, kicking, tennis, golf, handball,

88
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
and pole vault.

89
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,220
The gap increases to around 30% for cricket, volleyball, long drives in golf, and weightlifting.

90
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,220
For baseball and field hockey, the gap is 50%.

91
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,040
I've heard a lot of trans activists make the point that it's not just biology, but also

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,360
social differences in the promotion of sport.

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,640
Most notably Mia Mulder, where in her video, Should a Trans Woman Be Allowed in Women's

94
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Sports?

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
That sounds familiar.

96
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
She says,

97
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,680
When women began being involved in sports, sports science and other things relating to

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,120
sport had not been adapted for women bodies.

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,280
The entire playing field had already been made by and for men.

100
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,320
And that's not to mention that most athletes then and even now are men, which means that

101
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,960
when we're talking about higher level competitions, men will have more competition to even reach

102
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,760
that stage, which will make them perform better.

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,040
If you have 500 men competing in a sport and only 10 women competing in the same sport,

104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,240
odds are the men are going to outperform the women, even if the playing field is completely

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,640
level, which means that there's basically no way for women to actually compete with

106
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,480
men, even when there is no biological difference.

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
And you know, that's actually a good point.

108
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
If men have been playing and competing against each other for centuries and women are only

109
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,880
just starting up, there's certainly a cumulative effect, not on any one man, but on the surrounding

110
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,000
culture of sport, how to train, what to eat, the quality of the surrounding competition

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,760
that you can train yourself against.

112
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,880
In most cases, top level female athletes are not given the same level of consideration

113
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,680
as top level male athletes.

114
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,360
This again should surprise no one.

115
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,040
But unfortunately for Mia Mulder, this study also covers that too.

116
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,000
It is acknowledged that this divergence has been compounded historically by a lag in the

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,240
cultural acceptance of and financial provision for females in sport that may have had implications

118
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,880
for the rate of improvement in athletic performance in females.

119
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,640
Yet since the 1990s, the difference in performance records between males and females has been

120
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,960
relatively stable, suggesting that the biological differences created by androgenization explain

121
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,080
most of the male advantage and are insurmountable.

122
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,520
Oh well, it turns out, even when things are culturally constructed, the foundation that

123
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,440
they're built atop of is biological.

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Who knew?

125
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,680
Now that the study has definitively laid out that the difference between males and females

126
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,280
in sport is primarily based in biology, it then turns its attention to trans women in

127
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
sport.

128
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,800
Is the male performance advantage lost when testosterone is suppressed in transgender

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
women?

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Let's look at the data.

131
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,720
Here's a chart of changes in muscle mass and strength in trans women athletes pre-testosterone

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,840
suppression, as well as after at least 12 months of testosterone suppression, compared

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
with demographically matched female athletes.

134
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
Here's how you read the graph.

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,200
The 0% mark on the graph is the pre-suppression location in all instances, again for easy

136
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
comparison.

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
The data comes from a 2004 study and compares with 36 months on testosterone suppression,

138
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
focusing on thigh muscle mass.

139
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,480
So after the 36 months, the change was a 12% loss of thigh muscle mass in the trans athletes,

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,680
which is still 13% more muscle mass than in their cis counterparts.

141
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Going down this graph, the results are damning.

142
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,640
The amount of strength and muscle mass for these various body parts and exercises are

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,280
mostly in the single digits post-testosterone.

144
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,480
And their advantages over their cis counterparts remains huge.

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,680
Here's the same data set, this time with the pre-suppression at trans figures anchored

146
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,600
to 100%, and it also includes average male athletes.

147
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Pre-suppression at trans are the white circles, post-suppression trans are the black circles,

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,960
males are diamonds, females are squares.

149
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,640
For example, in grip strength, men were significantly stronger than both cis and trans women, but

150
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
trans women were significantly stronger than cis women, and 12 months on test suppression

151
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
only slightly lowered that advantage.

152
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
The study concludes that strength, lean body mass, muscle size, and bone density are only

153
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,800
trivially affected by testosterone suppression.

154
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
And the reductions observed in muscle mass, size, and strength are very small compared

155
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,120
to the baseline differences between males and females in these variables.

156
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,600
And thus, there are major performance and safety implications in sports where these

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,360
attributes are competitively significant.

158
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,480
The data significantly undermines the delivery of fairness and safety presumed by the criteria

159
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,680
set out in transgender inclusion policies, particularly given the stated prioritization

160
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,440
of fairness as an overriding objective for the IOC.

161
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,180
If those policies are intended to preserve fairness, inclusion, and the safety of biologically

162
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,220
female athletes, sporting organizations may need to reassess their policies regarding

163
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,280
the inclusion of transgender women.

164
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,180
There is another study that says basically the same thing.

165
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,940
We don't gotta pore over it because I think the point's been made, but you can check

166
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,180
it for yourself if you want.

167
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,420
It's called How Does Hormone Transition in Transgender Women Change Body Composition?

168
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,620
Muscle Strength in Hemoglobin, systematic review with a focus on the implications for

169
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,700
sport participation.

170
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,660
Its conclusion states, in trans women, hormone therapy rapidly reduces HGB to levels seen

171
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,760
in cisgender women.

172
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,200
In contrast, hormone therapy decreases strength, LBM, and muscle area, yet values remain above

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,360
that observed in cisgender women, even after 36 months.

174
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
These findings suggest that strength may well be preserved in trans women during the first

175
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
three years of hormone therapy.

176
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,440
Okay, yes, I think it's fair to say at this point that trans women have a significant

177
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
advantage against cis women in professional level sport.

178
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
And like the conclusion of the previous study said, if fairness and inclusion of cis women

179
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,600
is the goal, then the inclusion of trans women may not be compatible with that goal.

180
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,880
Of course, some trans women athletes just don't care.

181
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,940
In 2019, Rachel McKinnon picked up a gold medal for cycling in the 2019 Masters Track

182
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,120
Cycling World Championships as a trans woman competing against cis women.

183
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,940
And she had this to say about it.

184
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm legally and medically female, but the people who oppose my existence still want

185
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
to think of me as male.

186
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,480
They use the language of that I'm a man.

187
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,440
And so there's this stereotype that men are always stronger than women.

188
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,840
And so if you think of trans women as men, then you think there's an unfair advantage.

189
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,020
Do you accept that there may still be an advantage?

190
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,400
Is it possible?

191
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Yes.

192
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:00,240
However, the range of body sizes and strength levels within a sport, you can be successful

193
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,640
with massively different body compositions, even within my sport.

194
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,880
Yeah, just straight up.

195
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,960
It's possible I have an advantage because I'm biologically male, but I'll just hand

196
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,480
wave that with, oh, there's all sorts of body types.

197
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
It's bullshit.

198
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
We all know that you're just muddying the waters because you have a gold medal that

199
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
you want to keep.

200
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
We get it.

201
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,740
And then there's cases of trans women who have not yet medically transitioned or whose

202
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,340
transition status is unknown.

203
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,040
And despite that, they run against cis women anyway.

204
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
That's just BS.

205
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,860
Medically, in terms of physical fitness, not their identity or how they view themselves,

206
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,680
they are on par with cis men.

207
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,200
They're biologically males with either no testosterone suppression or no lasting effects

208
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,960
from newly begun suppression.

209
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,720
This is purely ridiculous.

210
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,540
There's a lot of arguments from trans activists to try and counter all of this stuff.

211
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,440
A lot of them are summarized in Mia Mulder's video, but not all of them.

212
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,080
For example, Caster Semenya is often brought up, the runner from South Africa who turned

213
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,880
out to be intersex, but she didn't know it.

214
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,040
That fact was discovered after she had been running professionally in shattering records

215
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
and the league ended up testing her to see if she was using steroids or had some kind

216
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
of medical condition.

217
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,760
The media in South Africa treated Semenya quite poorly once it came out that she had

218
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,200
naturally elevated levels of testosterone due to the presence of internal testes, aka

219
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,520
balls inside her body where her ovaries should be, despite outwardly completely appearing

220
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
to be female.

221
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,420
In 2019, citing Semenya's case, new world athletics rules came into force stating that

222
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,900
people like Semenya would have to take testosterone suppressants to compete in women's leagues.

223
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,320
It may give trans activists a lot of moral weight to appeal to the terrible way in which

224
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,280
Semenya was treated, having this fact about herself that she didn't even know outed publicly

225
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,420
and humiliatingly.

226
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
And yeah, fair enough.

227
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,640
But that doesn't actually bolster any arguments regarding trans women in sports, because Semenya

228
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,760
isn't trans, intersex isn't trans, trans isn't intersex, and the way the trans community

229
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,240
appropriates intersex issues to prop up their own arguments is honestly pretty disgusting.

230
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,320
Desiring to transition because you have gender dysphoria and being born with a genital deformation

231
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,360
that causes abnormal hormonal effects are not the same thing despite the possibility

232
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
for some overlap.

233
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,920
Arguments like Rachel McKinnon's are brought up, that it's all just different body types

234
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
and who cares.

235
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,640
The downstream conclusion from that position comes with multiple suggestions, each with

236
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,840
their own problems.

237
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,380
For example, rather than differentiating males from females, why don't we differentiate

238
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,060
based on weight or height class?

239
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,840
The issue there being that males would dominate almost every single one of those classes in

240
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
every single sport.

241
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,380
Another suggestion is that we differentiate based on various hormone levels, but as the

242
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,980
studies that we've talked about today show, that doesn't actually equalize the playing

243
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
field.

244
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,880
The male puberty is still a problem.

245
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,960
The counter to that complaint, the it doesn't equalize the playing field one, is often for

246
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,040
the trans activist to bring up Michael Phelps.

247
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,000
He does actually have a genetic abnormality, giving him an abnormally long wingspan.

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
I still find it funny it's called a wingspan on humans.

249
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,740
As well as another abnormality concerning the build up of lactic acid in his muscles,

250
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
giving him more stamina.

251
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,000
Clearly, these genetic differences make it unfair for regular males to compete against

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
him, right?

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So why is he included?

254
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
And you know, fair enough, but ultimately sport is about competition, it's about finding

255
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
the best athlete.

256
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,800
So, by what metric do we decide where a line should be drawn?

257
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,440
The natural end result of this is saying, fuck it, there's no metrics, there's no sex

258
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,640
classes, there's no weight or height classes, all genetic abnormalities are allowed, it

259
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,120
will just be a free for all.

260
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,280
And fine, fair enough, you can do that, but that means that cis males will win every single

261
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
sporting competition ever.

262
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,240
In other words, when TERFs say something like, they want to take away women's spaces, in

263
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,120
this instance, if we followed the logic to its natural conclusion, the TERFs would actually

264
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
be correct.

265
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,560
We would be taking away that biologically female, the cis women's sporting space, and

266
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,280
in many instances, we would also be taking away trans women's sporting spaces as well.

267
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,000
And if you're more on the pro-trans side of things, listening to this, thinking, nah,

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,480
no way, that's just hyperbole.

269
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,920
There's no way that any trans activist thinks that.

270
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Here is a trans activist saying exactly that on a panel on this topic from just a few days

271
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
ago.

272
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,800
I think Wine Moms' like, essentially idea of a ranking system based on skill is completely

273
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:52,200
fine, and that you have classes for like the 800 to 1,600 to 799, shit like that, sounds

274
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,140
completely reasonable to me.

275
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,900
And if it eliminates women's spaces from sports, and makes it so that, I mean, keep

276
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,700
in mind, it'd be eliminating men's spaces from sports as well, and I have absolutely

277
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,340
no issue with that.

278
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,740
The TERFs are completely right.

279
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,540
I do want to actually get rid of gendered spaces in the sports arena, and that they

280
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,920
are 100% right.

281
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,420
And I don't base my opinions off of what the most radical TERFs, you know, fear that I'm

282
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,460
going to do.

283
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,400
So to me, this open it all up solution seems to be completely untenable.

284
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,620
The reason that we have women's sport is because generally women can't compete with men, and

285
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,040
so they have a place where they can play with people who are generally on their own level.

286
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,780
It's so funny to hear Prague say shit like, we can't implement blind hiring practices

287
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,580
because not enough black people will get hired if you just leave it down to qualifications.

288
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,800
We need diversity hires, but then they completely 180 on that logic when it comes to women in

289
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
sport.

290
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,620
What they want will literally lead to a huge population, cis women, being not represented

291
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,820
at all in almost any physical arena.

292
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,540
Putting trans women into women's leagues, frankly seems unfair to cis women.

293
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,920
Not only that, but those same rules mean that trans men will never be able to outcompete

294
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,940
cis men at sport, something that trans activists never actually think about because trans men

295
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,740
also lack the advantages of that male puberty.

296
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,720
No matter what, somebody is getting excluded here.

297
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,980
My preferred solution is to create trans men and trans women's leagues of their own.

298
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,420
If you go back to that study that I talked about before and look at that graph that averaged

299
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,620
the differences of all the measurements, you will see that the gap between men and post

300
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,900
suppression trans women is similar to the gap between trans women and cis women.

301
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,780
They are clearly their own classification sports-wise.

302
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,980
The common trans activist counterargument to this is that there's so few trans women

303
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,220
they'd never actually be able to form a league, and yeah, that unfortunately also

304
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,620
seems to be true, but it is still the least bad option.

305
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,800
Having cis men destroy trans women or having trans women destroy cis women seems to be

306
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,620
erasing a population from sport entirely.

307
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,780
Abolishing categories might appeal to that socialist or anarchist spirit on the left,

308
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,020
but it does the same thing in reality.

309
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,860
The least bad option is trans-specific sports leagues, where they may compete on a relatively

310
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,980
even playing field with other athletes.

311
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,660
If women's leagues can become more popular over time and play catch-up with the men's

312
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,060
leagues, then surely trans women's leagues can too.
