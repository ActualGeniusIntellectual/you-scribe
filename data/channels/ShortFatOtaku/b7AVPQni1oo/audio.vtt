Okay welcome, welcome, welcome one and all to yet another episode of WIC-TV Across Ideological

00:08.160 --> 00:13.520
Platform where we can come together to talk about issues both political and cultural from the silly

00:13.520 --> 00:21.680
to the serious and gang we have a show for you today. Many moons ago, years ago, mortal enemies

00:21.680 --> 00:27.920
a battlefield littered with rhetorical corpses and champions on either side standing strong

00:27.920 --> 00:34.880
eyeing each other across a moonlit field swords at the ready blood staining everything they did

00:34.880 --> 00:43.200
today however both sit before you right in a much more peaceful setting a calm setting

00:43.200 --> 00:50.640

01:14.960 --> 01:18.960

uh youtubers am i live am i here can you hear me well yeah let's make sure this is important wick

01:33.600 --> 01:39.840
has been censored by big tech i might have youtube is up there you go you just popped in okay okay

01:39.840 --> 01:46.000
just took a minute that's a that sounds like a maybe a canadian slowness they're always a little

01:46.000 --> 01:51.520
bit behind so yeah i'll real quickly i'll tweet out that this is happening beautiful thank you

01:51.520 --> 02:00.080
thank you um but yeah i wanted to just kind of get um get the temperature check just in general

02:00.080 --> 02:06.800
i know that there's been a lot of really heavy discourse of late online um and in spaces so i

02:06.800 --> 02:11.840
just wanted to make sure like how how are we feeling uh brianne you privated a bunch of your

02:11.840 --> 02:17.440
stuff today what what happened i i'm just tired of getting yelled at by my own sidewalk and it's

02:17.440 --> 02:22.640
not more complicated than that though i never privated my twitter even during gamer gate and

02:22.640 --> 02:29.280
that's just how bad it's been lately um yeah there's nothing to it it's just um yeah i think

02:29.280 --> 02:36.320
it's and dev i i don't know how you feel but i think it's really clear that a portion of my own

02:36.320 --> 02:44.240
movement has uh certainly been engaged in apologia for uh you know october 7th and uh i've tried to

02:44.240 --> 02:49.440
push back on that even though i stand with you know the palestinian people and uh it's just

02:49.440 --> 02:54.320
really been uh really unpleasant lately um so i've just i've had enough that's it

02:57.360 --> 03:03.040
here to be alive be with us i'm posting the final message okay okay let's let him get his tweet out

03:03.600 --> 03:10.320
i i've just annoyingly added everyone in my discord that'll work well thank you i appreciate it

03:10.320 --> 03:16.160
yeah no problem no problem um but um to that right um you've been watching this from afar

03:16.160 --> 03:20.720
i've seen you tweet on it i've seen you reply to posts and things dev what what is your take on

03:20.720 --> 03:26.080
this whole situation on ocuber 7th like the israel no on the uh the discourse surrounding it to be

03:26.080 --> 03:32.560
clear right um it's cancerous yeah i expect that from the internet at this point to be honest

03:32.640 --> 03:37.440
i've i've seen so many so many news cycles where people will take the most extreme

03:37.440 --> 03:44.400
version of events push it just outside the realm of truth so that people who agree with them still

03:44.400 --> 03:48.080
still hold on to it because it's still somewhat truthful and then they just roll with they just

03:48.080 --> 03:52.560
run with the narrative right like i've seen right wingers do this with a whole bunch of things

03:52.560 --> 03:57.200
concerning trump i've seen left wingers do this with the whole like for for the past 10 years

03:57.200 --> 04:00.320
discourse has been a nightmare online in my opinion i'm old enough to remember what it was

04:00.320 --> 04:06.640
like before i think it was it was still bad 10 years ago i think it was bad 15 years ago

04:06.640 --> 04:13.280
i think it is definitely getting worse um but i think part of that is you know when you and i

04:13.280 --> 04:18.480
were growing up deaf and i assume we're roughly the same age because the music from your videos

04:18.480 --> 04:24.400
is like parasite eve and final fantasy 8 so i just assume you love those for the same reasons i do

04:24.560 --> 04:30.000
i grew up in the 90s yeah yeah yeah i mean the the the normies just were not online it was only

04:30.000 --> 04:36.480
people like us so i think that the addition to the uh to the cool kids has uh really made the

04:36.480 --> 04:43.360
internet a much worse place to be it used to just be uh yeah um sexism and now it's terrorist

04:43.360 --> 04:51.040
apology so that's not good ah there was i know there were definitely some real sexist back in

04:51.040 --> 04:54.960
the day but there was also a lot of joking around too yeah sometimes sometimes it was hard to tell

04:54.960 --> 05:00.720
the difference between the two but uh yeah things have gotten worse for sure yeah definitely i guess

05:00.720 --> 05:09.200
on that note right like of back in the day um i guess i'll just ask this to you first brianna

05:09.200 --> 05:15.120
and i'm curious what dev would have to say uh i'm again as i alluded to before there were a lot of

05:16.080 --> 05:22.000
well we've we've had a lot on online presence for a long time um how do you feel you've grown since

05:22.000 --> 05:29.440
then and in what ways right oh boy that's a long question well we got a long time i set aside two

05:29.440 --> 05:35.360
hours for y'all we gotta talk about something right well i think you one of the thing the

05:35.360 --> 05:41.840
things is the older you get um i i think that if you do it correctly you're you're constantly

05:41.840 --> 05:47.200
changing and growing and you you take in new information i don't think that's true for everyone

05:47.840 --> 05:55.120
i think that some people uh get really static the older that they get but for me you know i i think

05:55.120 --> 06:02.640
you keep i think you keep adding new information and hopefully like ending up at better answers um

06:02.640 --> 06:08.400
i think for me personally one way i've grown is just getting more and more and more over the

06:08.480 --> 06:14.640
trauma of my childhood which makes me less reactive uh though i can certainly be reactive

06:14.640 --> 06:22.480
but um not being in that fight or flight mode all the time um is certainly helpful um i i think that

06:23.520 --> 06:31.200
one of the really big changes in me personally today versus the gamergate era is i've seen

06:31.200 --> 06:36.880
like jessabelle just closed yesterday who was a huge force in the gamergate years i love jessabelle

06:36.880 --> 06:42.880
i love most of the writers at jessabelle and i think like the the financial collapse of that

06:42.880 --> 06:48.800
particular business model you know part of it is due to mismanagement by uh the private equity

06:48.800 --> 06:58.240
firm that bought them out but i also think part of it is we have the tactics of feminism that

06:58.240 --> 07:05.600
we've employed for the last 10 15 years are clearly not resulting in a vibrant movement

07:05.600 --> 07:12.560
it's not resulting in more real world rights um it's not resulting in a conversation about what

07:12.560 --> 07:19.280
women are facing and i think for me personally the biggest lesson i've taken is that internet

07:19.280 --> 07:26.160
screaming does not really equate to real world policies if that makes sense oh that makes sense

07:26.160 --> 07:34.080
to me right like do we have to ask ourselves like is what we're doing moving us towards what we want

07:34.080 --> 07:39.440
or is it moving us away or is it just like making us shred water um i i've seen a lot of posts and

07:39.440 --> 07:45.600
this is kind of not a non-soc whatever a little bit of an aside of people who are swearing they're

07:45.600 --> 07:50.480
never going to vote for joe biden right they're like oh i will never vote for genocide joe is that

07:50.480 --> 07:56.160
what the term they use like and then the question you ask is like well considering that you want

07:56.160 --> 08:04.080
policies that genocide joe will support and the other options will not what what do you think

08:04.080 --> 08:09.280
you're accomplishing here is this moving you closer to your political objectives or is it

08:09.280 --> 08:14.000
moving you further away and i think we all kind of have to ask that but i want to isn't just well

08:14.000 --> 08:19.440
hold on because this will piggyback into dev you know dev one of the reasons i enjoy your videos is

08:19.440 --> 08:25.040
i think um and before people online scream at me i do think you come up with a lot of things are

08:25.040 --> 08:31.040
structurally are wrong with the directions that progressives are going that's not to say i agree

08:31.040 --> 08:36.800
with the conclusion she reached but i think you've really put your finger on some of the things that

08:36.800 --> 08:42.240
are wrong with our movement today and one of those are the purity spiral that you have an excellent

08:42.240 --> 08:47.760
video about and the utopianism that we kind of fall into so i would love to hear like from your

08:47.760 --> 08:52.880
point of view how you feel about that well i mean i'm not a progressive right i don't view myself

08:53.120 --> 09:01.280
aggressive so you're not no no like i'm glad we got that settled i was curious right i

09:01.280 --> 09:06.080
i view myself as like an adam and sitch style enlightened centrist you know i definitely do

09:06.080 --> 09:10.400
not like the right wing there are some serious problems on on the right i grew up with the right

09:10.400 --> 09:15.920
wing trying to censor video games and and wanting to repress gay people and i didn't like any of

09:15.920 --> 09:22.400
that when i was when i was younger um and i think because the right wing was so ascendant in the 90s

09:22.480 --> 09:27.040
at least culturally um it was easy to be a leftist it was easy to be like a cent like maybe not

09:27.040 --> 09:31.040
not like a communist or anything but it was easy to be like you know why shouldn't we have health

09:31.040 --> 09:34.320
care i mean we have health care in canada but why shouldn't america have health care right why

09:34.320 --> 09:38.560
shouldn't we have gay marriage these were kind of easy they're like slam dunks for people who are

09:38.560 --> 09:45.280
left-leaning right um but the slam dunks are kind of drying up and now you have tougher questions

09:45.280 --> 09:50.400
on the left and the answers to those questions aren't exclusively leftist because because now

09:50.400 --> 09:54.240
you're getting into like more esoteric things like you know should trans women compete in

09:54.240 --> 09:58.800
women's sports that's not a slam dunk it's a complicated question there's a lot in there

09:58.800 --> 10:06.800
you know so i think i think the reason that there has been a slow shift away from broader leftism

10:06.800 --> 10:11.520
is because it accomplished a lot it accomplished a lot of good but we're kind of running out of the

10:11.520 --> 10:14.640
good we're not we haven't completely run out of it but we've but it's definitely starting to run out

10:14.640 --> 10:21.920
of good stuff out of the on on that note like what would you say currently in 2023 today is the

10:23.200 --> 10:30.000
what should progresses in your opinion be putting out there what do you think is their strongest

10:30.000 --> 10:35.520
argument that they have today right what should they be focusing on right now yes uh health care

10:35.520 --> 10:40.720
yeah american needs health care yeah that is that is the big one um oh and you talked about

10:40.720 --> 10:45.440
utopianism and purity spiraling brianna i'll give you a concrete example okay so

10:46.240 --> 10:50.080
you see a lot um a lot of rhetoric on the left they see that they say they're very far left is

10:50.080 --> 10:53.040
you know health care is a human right everything should be free everything should be available to

10:53.040 --> 10:57.040
everyone otherwise you are oppressing people and you're letting people die you're killing people

10:57.040 --> 11:01.680
in fact um in practical terms what we've discovered looking at like the uk's health

11:01.680 --> 11:05.600
care system and france's and canada's health care system what we've discovered is that if you make

11:05.600 --> 11:10.160
everything free you have a shit ton of waste there's and you don't you only have so much

11:10.160 --> 11:15.680
resources to go around there's so many doctors only so much time so if you make everything free

11:15.680 --> 11:21.840
you end up bankrupting your system you can't like it's it's fucked however if you add like a 20

11:21.840 --> 11:27.840
copay to go to the doctors you cut out like 90 of the waste because most people who are just showing

11:27.840 --> 11:31.360
up to like get a day off work and get a doctor's note they're not going to do that because it's

11:31.360 --> 11:37.600
not free anymore right so the the i these numbers are i got them from econoboi like a year ago i

11:37.600 --> 11:41.600
can't pull them up right away but i do remember them as being mostly accurate is that basically

11:41.600 --> 11:46.800
if you add a 20 copay you cut out 90 of your health care waste um in terms of like people

11:46.800 --> 11:53.600
actually like health care waste from from patients so that's that's not ideologically pure

11:53.600 --> 11:57.520
if you're talking about health care as a human right like if that's your value well now it's not

11:57.520 --> 12:01.760
a human right now it costs twenty dollars which means that if somebody doesn't have twenty dollars

12:01.760 --> 12:05.600
if they're too poor and they no one can lend them twenty dollars and they can't get a job

12:05.600 --> 12:09.840
well that person is fucked they're not going to get health care but it also means that you get to

12:09.840 --> 12:15.200
have a health care service for everyone else right so there's certain instances where if you're

12:15.200 --> 12:20.640
ideologically pure you actually end up with worse results than if you compromise and i think health

12:20.640 --> 12:26.160
care is one of those yeah i i certainly agree with that i think that there's that trend across

12:26.160 --> 12:32.480
the board right like we're seeing it right now i think uh really hyperbolically with with with the

12:32.480 --> 12:39.360
israel hamas war and the rhetoric around that you know if you have a stance that is yeah i did to

12:39.360 --> 12:44.400
our wic panel the other night and i said multiple times like i stand with the people of palestine

12:44.400 --> 12:50.720
the human rights abuses towards uh civilians is unconscionable i don't support it our top like

12:50.720 --> 12:56.800
foreign policy in this region should be to you know stop the violence uh but if you don't

12:56.800 --> 13:03.920
leap to the most extreme conclusion there like a one-state solution and like implementing a

13:03.920 --> 13:10.640
democratic utopia there and taking away the borders uh you are just uh you don't have a voice

13:10.640 --> 13:16.480
in the conversation so i agree with you on that yeah dev i do want to say in like tonight i hope

13:16.480 --> 13:21.920
we can just have a respectful back and forth about some of your content i was studying a lot

13:21.920 --> 13:27.360
of your videos which again largely i enjoy they're well produced they're well thought out i think that

13:27.360 --> 13:34.160
this is stuff the left needs an answer for i've noticed though that there's a really big difference

13:34.160 --> 13:41.760
in how you define progressives and is i define progressives depending what the argument is

13:41.760 --> 13:47.920
you're trying to make there's one i was watching and yeah you define progressives in this nice

13:47.920 --> 13:55.600
people that want health care but as like antifa antifa and self-id like trans people you know

13:55.600 --> 14:01.040
they're non-binary and just want to make it up on the fly right so i think like one of the the

14:01.040 --> 14:06.720
things i find sometimes difficult about your content is it it sometimes feels like you have

14:06.720 --> 14:12.560
a conclusion that you want to reach that both sides are equally bad and you kind of reach for

14:12.560 --> 14:17.680
facts that fit that and i don't always think it's an accurate way to to view a situation

14:19.120 --> 14:24.080
well how do you define progressives then what's your view of it i have a much more charitable

14:24.080 --> 14:30.400
point of view on this right uh which is it is i think the highest level progressivism is about

14:30.400 --> 14:35.840
wanting structural um change for solutions like health care is a really good example

14:36.400 --> 14:42.240
um you know i grew up in mississippi so when i think about structural racism in the united states

14:42.240 --> 14:48.720
um i realize there's no policy around the edges that's gonna you know make that society heal from

14:48.720 --> 14:54.960
the the wounds still open today from the civil war so i think at the highest levels like

14:54.960 --> 15:01.680
progressivism is about thinking about big structural policy changes what i you and i

15:01.680 --> 15:08.240
i think agree on is that there's a real tendency especially online to reformat to mean this

15:08.240 --> 15:13.920
extremely online kind of argument that tends towards a purity spiral which is not helpful

15:18.240 --> 15:25.280
that's true but it is um it's not just online but i think it it comes out online because it's it's

15:25.280 --> 15:31.280
so easy right i think you know twitter is no longer 240 characters or whatever it was but

15:31.280 --> 15:35.840
it was for a very long time and i think that promoted a certain type of very uh very short

15:35.840 --> 15:40.960
thinking where you could you have to fit it into a very small box and people did that for a decade

15:40.960 --> 15:44.720
and now we have a bunch of short thinkers if that makes sense especially if you're like like a

15:44.720 --> 15:48.400
twitter addict or you're a journalist or something i think i think twitter ruined a lot of people's

15:48.400 --> 15:55.600
brains i think that's part of it yeah um but but the bigger the bigger problem i think i'm gonna

15:55.600 --> 16:01.040
have to i'm gonna have to do a bit of philosophizing unfortunately go ahead which i i did i did with

16:01.040 --> 16:08.560
the carl max debate as well just to explain a few things so there's um there's a a leftist

16:08.560 --> 16:15.440
philosopher named herbert marcus and he came up with this idea and he it's called it's not called

16:15.440 --> 16:20.160
the march of progress but we'll just use march of progress as a shorthand and the idea basically

16:20.160 --> 16:23.680
is that if you have and he thought this is a good thing he was promoting this i don't think it's a

16:23.680 --> 16:30.720
good thing if you have a movement that is based on change and then you kind of universalize that

16:31.200 --> 16:36.720
so so that it's it simply pursues change it inevitably radicalizes and drives off a cliff

16:36.720 --> 16:43.200
it has to because it's not it's not aiming at a goal it's aiming at change itself so it's like

16:43.200 --> 16:48.160
if you say i want to change to do xyz that's one thing but if you're saying i want to change for

16:48.160 --> 16:53.920
changes sake then that's where the utopianism comes from and the purity spiraling and he

16:53.920 --> 16:59.200
outlined this all in a book called repressive tolerance where the idea is that tolerance in

16:59.200 --> 17:07.200
his view had to repress um people who weren't tolerant right well this is where i think i would

17:07.200 --> 17:13.840
like one of the reasons the way like my views on what women are facing in america have not

17:13.840 --> 17:20.240
changed since gamergate what has changed radically is the way i go about trying to

17:20.240 --> 17:26.800
like affect that change right because i agree with you like at some point um you know we turned

17:26.800 --> 17:33.920
a corner in how we are talking about what women face in american society and we stopped talking

17:33.920 --> 17:39.360
about policies and we started talking more about an aesthetic where if you had the right

17:39.920 --> 17:46.880
like points of view and the expanded feminism to mean you know body shaming and you know this this

17:46.880 --> 17:54.080
this very wide gamut of related struggles where you had to kind of identify with all of these

17:54.080 --> 18:01.520
values and then eventually hopefully you could talk about the policy um i think this is where

18:01.520 --> 18:07.920
feminism really fucked up frankly in the gamergate era if i could do anything and go relive those

18:07.920 --> 18:13.440
years over again i would have gotten off of twitter and i would have used the political

18:13.440 --> 18:19.680
capital i had in that moment to push microsoft push activision to like change their internal

18:19.680 --> 18:27.280
hiring processes right um and and i think that we've really gotten to a point where

18:27.280 --> 18:34.320
feminism as a force is not going to be effective until we take a step back and go hold on what are

18:34.320 --> 18:40.080
the issues we need to be thinking about uh child care is completely unaffordable women have been

18:40.080 --> 18:45.280
run out of the workforce post-covid we're not really seeing an investment in that until we

18:45.280 --> 18:50.800
look at these kind of bigger structural issues i don't see us like becoming relevant force in

18:50.800 --> 18:58.400
politics again one thing that i noticed in your answers here from both of you right

18:58.400 --> 19:07.120
um when uh dev asked you what is progressivism what who is progressive etc uh and then also

19:07.120 --> 19:13.200
from dev's uh philosophizing there i think i've kind of had a a bit of a eureka moment and bear

19:13.200 --> 19:24.080
with me right um in my mind woo right progressivism from your uh definition what you gave to me

19:24.080 --> 19:31.840
is progress towards a goal right but it should be it is not but what but what a lot of progressives

19:31.840 --> 19:37.440
and what i've seen this argument online before right is that we are going to progress for

19:37.520 --> 19:43.200
progress's sake like we are going to move forward right regardless of where that is we are going to

19:43.200 --> 19:47.520
move forward we have to move past capitalism we have to move past these things we have to move

19:47.520 --> 19:54.080
forward right and i think that um sometimes at least in the sfo videos i've seen that is the

19:54.880 --> 20:02.480
that is the uh what progressives are painted as and i don't think those that's that's a fair

20:03.040 --> 20:09.200
characterization dev right i think that like yes there's some of that um and i think that's mostly

20:09.200 --> 20:15.680
online stuff but i do think that plenty of progressives plenty of people who who do identify

20:15.680 --> 20:21.840
as progressives are towards specific goals um does that make sense how am i off my rocker here

20:22.720 --> 20:27.680
that does make sense but i'm not sure it's entirely accurate i mean there's there's some

20:27.680 --> 20:32.720
accuracy there i think but considering how much blowback you've been receiving recently brianne

20:32.720 --> 20:38.560
you have to know that there's definitely not just a small radical online fringe but a significant

20:38.560 --> 20:46.400
number of people who now believe this way yeah i i completely agree uh and i've you know we've

20:46.400 --> 20:51.680
talked about this privately in dms i don't mind sharing it here but you know i i personally

20:51.680 --> 20:57.840
believe that the left is just 10 years behind the right as far as being radicalized on the internet

20:57.840 --> 21:04.320
right i think a lot of the same tendencies we see in the tea party uh have now come to our own

21:04.320 --> 21:10.160
doorstep um i think this version of the democratic party unfortunately would be very susceptible to

21:10.720 --> 21:17.600
uh you know a left-wing donald trump if a figure like that came along so i i agree with you i think

21:17.600 --> 21:23.520
there's time to stop it and you know wick one of the reasons i consider you a good friend at this

21:23.520 --> 21:30.880
point is i think i think we have i have a different i think the degree to which i think women are not

21:30.880 --> 21:35.120
getting a fair shake in society is a little different than yours i think we have a different

21:35.120 --> 21:42.000
appraisal there but directionally i think we both see this torrent of crazy on both sides and we're

21:42.000 --> 21:47.040
taking a step and saying this needs to be about policy we've got to calm this down and we've got

21:47.040 --> 21:52.080
to learn to talk to each other so we can have a functioning democracy you know i very much agree

21:52.080 --> 21:58.400
with you about that so does that make sense to you dev i think so yeah yeah um to go back to what you

21:58.400 --> 22:03.520
were saying earlier you mentioned that um basically progressives have been making less progress as the

22:03.520 --> 22:07.600
radicalizations happened right yeah um you probably don't agree with my characterization of this but

22:07.600 --> 22:15.280
i'm going to give it anyway please um i think that there was a lot of um of things that needed to be

22:15.280 --> 22:19.360
fixed and the feminists fixed a lot of them not all of them but they fixed a lot of them over

22:19.360 --> 22:25.280
let's say the past 100 years or so there's been a lot of improvement um and then as the the number

22:25.280 --> 22:33.040
of things to fix began to dry up you started to see them focus on on small things right micro

22:33.040 --> 22:37.120
aggressions body shaming like you mentioned you know think things that weren't nearly as important

22:37.120 --> 22:43.120
as should women be allowed to hold jobs and vote you know much smaller things and then as they

22:43.120 --> 22:49.120
focused on the smaller things um they radicalized they became a lot more crazy looking to the normies

22:49.920 --> 22:56.400
and then while they were in that that echo chamber they started taking big l's like with roe v wade

22:56.400 --> 23:03.600
yeah and and like the rollback of lgbt acceptance so i think i think there's been this um this ebb

23:03.600 --> 23:09.840
and flow where as the left the broader left has been accomplishing goals they've run out of goals

23:09.840 --> 23:14.400
to accomplish and which has radicalized them then they became crazy then they started rolling back

23:14.400 --> 23:18.160
they started losing all those goals they had accomplished so i understand that these things

23:18.160 --> 23:23.200
happened at the same time dad but my question to you would be like are and i want you to be

23:23.200 --> 23:29.120
clear here are you blaming that um that niche kind of focus that the left has had on the micro

23:29.120 --> 23:35.360
aggressions and the small things as to why they lost roe v wade and as to why they've taken big

23:35.360 --> 23:41.120
l's when it comes to lgbtq processes of protections and stuff is that are you are you

23:41.120 --> 23:46.640
implying that there is a causation factor there i think there partially is yes i mean obviously

23:46.640 --> 23:50.480
another part of it is that they have political opponents who want to roll those things back and

23:50.480 --> 23:55.440
they took that opportunity right but they they made themselves weak they gave them the opening

23:55.440 --> 24:01.680
you know i i hear what you're saying and i'm not going to deny there's a lot of that that's going

24:01.680 --> 24:08.400
on i i definitely think so i i think and you talked about this in your video about the purity

24:08.400 --> 24:12.960
spiral right uh which is excellent i hope we can leave that in the show notes and people will check

24:12.960 --> 24:18.240
it out i think if you're on the left thank you very much dev has a very good analysis of a real

24:18.240 --> 24:25.600
problem that we have um but even in your own video you talk about how this is advantageous for us to

24:26.240 --> 24:32.560
build a coalition but in the end is kind of a cancer that eats us apart right so i think i

24:32.560 --> 24:38.800
think that's exactly what happened right this started with us kind of all getting together

24:38.800 --> 24:43.840
and going hey you know we've all noticed that our sexual assault claims are being kind of

24:43.840 --> 24:50.160
systematically not being taken seriously i think women across a wide variety of fields look around

24:50.160 --> 24:54.480
at the workplace and go you know what i have a lot of trouble being taken seriously and being

24:54.480 --> 25:00.240
heard on my own teams right or as soon as i have a child i've noticed that my my my job is very

25:00.240 --> 25:06.000
eager to show me a door right this is a set of problems that we've certainly not solved and we're

25:06.000 --> 25:15.040
nowhere near solving what i think has happened is i think online is a trap particularly for people

25:15.040 --> 25:20.880
you know i want to be really clear i fell into this trap i i look back at my own congressional

25:20.880 --> 25:27.200
run and i think if i understood the things i do today i think i would have had a much better shot

25:27.200 --> 25:34.800
of winning because what i can look back and see really clearly was online was pushing me to take

25:34.800 --> 25:41.280
this this leftmost view on literally everything you know sex work not accepting you know money

25:41.280 --> 25:49.280
from xyz and really focusing on the superficial when what i needed to be doing was spending a lot

25:49.280 --> 25:54.160
more time in my district and talking about the policies like directly affecting their lives and

25:54.160 --> 26:01.120
that's something i would do very differently today online i think is a trap because i think it it

26:01.120 --> 26:07.200
gives people this feeling that they're they're making a change and i think it's with the best

26:07.200 --> 26:15.360
of intention you know um yeah i'm not uh i'm not like a fat person but i can really imagine that

26:16.000 --> 26:21.840
like feeling degraded all the time or feeling the ways that like society doesn't respect you i would

26:21.840 --> 26:26.960
imagine there's some anger and some trauma there and i think it probably feels good to talk about

26:26.960 --> 26:33.360
that online the problem is somewhere along the line like the problem is with online culture

26:33.360 --> 26:40.480
there's no point where we pause and say okay we need to make it so um you know people that are

26:40.480 --> 26:48.080
larger can access trains and planes with a little bit more dignity right there's not a public policy

26:48.080 --> 26:54.480
component that we're pushing for as much as the fringe left loves to shit on liberals i do think

26:54.480 --> 26:59.520
this is something structurally liberals are better at than progressives kind of forming coalitions

26:59.520 --> 27:07.920
and trying to get specific policies passed well insofar as the fat thing is concerned as a fat guy

27:08.720 --> 27:12.720
i'm quite how dare you speak over one of the oppressed classes

27:12.720 --> 27:21.200
briano we have a fat man i apologize okay i i will say that like being fat's just unhealthy

27:21.200 --> 27:26.160
and i think rather than like it it is better to promote public health than it is to promote

27:26.160 --> 27:31.040
you know accommodating people being fat i think we want people to lose weight not feel comfortable

27:31.040 --> 27:37.360
being being fat if that if that makes sense yeah i agree with that um but i also yeah this is

27:37.360 --> 27:42.560
something i saw like when i was running for office i do think that there are situations where i don't

27:42.560 --> 27:48.240
think it would kill airlines to have a few larger seats that are given for priority for people that

27:48.240 --> 27:54.960
physically can't fit in those seats that doesn't seem crazy to me right um maybe maybe the main the

27:54.960 --> 28:01.040
fat thing is a bad example there are any number of like reasonable public policy things we could

28:01.040 --> 28:07.680
be focused on and we just don't because the conversation is so much about uh like online

28:07.680 --> 28:13.520
purity here's a really good example uh the trans debate you know if you put me in charge tomorrow

28:13.520 --> 28:20.000
of like talking about the the trans public policy um you know issue i would try to find something

28:20.000 --> 28:25.920
very similar to gay marriage where like you're focused on a single public policy position with

28:25.920 --> 28:32.480
a broad possible range of support and i would make that like the rights of trans children to

28:32.480 --> 28:40.080
attend public school um but instead it gets into like this more esoteric thing and this more

28:40.080 --> 28:46.720
esoteric thing which often i agree with but i also understand how it's not ever going to be a

28:46.720 --> 28:52.800
popular public policy position and i think all of this is a trap i think if we're serious about

28:52.800 --> 28:58.640
things like health care and trans dignity and women's rights we've got to come up with a new

28:58.640 --> 29:05.520
strategy because any honest look at where the progressive movement is today you have to admit

29:05.520 --> 29:13.120
we have less cultural power today than we did a decade ago to you brianna right yeah you say this

29:13.680 --> 29:21.280
but the implications are are weird at that if the online is a trap does that not at least

29:21.280 --> 29:28.640
imply or infer that we should simply seed the field leave online to be do online things right

29:28.640 --> 29:33.600
and just leave it alone i think you and i could both agree and i think sfo might back us up that

29:33.600 --> 29:40.080
the online and how that uh plays out does have real world implications it does impact not only

29:40.080 --> 29:45.200
policy right but people's individuals lives as well like there are countless examples that we

29:45.200 --> 29:51.440
can point to of people being harassed stalked etc and also of policies that have been either

29:51.440 --> 29:57.440
implemented because of discourse that has started online or prevented from going through and or uh

29:59.360 --> 30:05.920
swift voted because of uh that's an old term uh because of online discourse right um

30:07.280 --> 30:14.320
like if online's a trap it's not a trap we can avoid is it i i've talked so much def go ahead

30:16.080 --> 30:20.880
i hmm i don't know how to how to answer that actually because i had a brainwave about a

30:20.880 --> 30:25.440
previous thing you were saying brianna and that was occupying my head i'm sorry wick no it's okay

30:25.440 --> 30:29.600
do your brainwave thing we can ignore wick we can we can just play as video games and make money off

30:31.200 --> 30:36.000
i will say wick i will say that like um i don't think you can ignore the online space

30:36.000 --> 30:39.760
because you have uh people who are more left-leaning complaining about harassment

30:39.760 --> 30:44.080
all the time and there's there's some faked harassment but there's a lot of real harassment

30:44.080 --> 30:47.120
but then you also have people on the right who complain about getting cancelled and that

30:47.120 --> 30:50.560
definitely happens too people have lost their jobs they've been de-banked they've had their

30:51.200 --> 30:55.440
social media shut down i'm gonna make a prediction for you there's going to be a left-wing

30:55.440 --> 31:01.120
resurgence in believing in cancel culture after uh after a month or two right like i think in the

31:01.120 --> 31:06.800
next couple months we're gonna we're gonna hear a you and cry of people decrying people losing

31:06.800 --> 31:12.080
their jobs for their political opinions i am guaranteeing that but go ahead yeah yeah yeah

31:12.080 --> 31:19.360
absolutely i know um for example kraut if you know kraut and t he recently said that in germany

31:19.360 --> 31:23.360
a whole bunch of migrants who had showed up from the middle east and now there's things

31:23.360 --> 31:27.680
stuff about israel they're getting they're getting deported because germany is very strict with its

31:27.680 --> 31:32.160
its jewish laws for obvious reasons right so there's a whole bunch of people who are just

31:32.160 --> 31:36.960
getting kicked out of germany now and so i do think there's going to be some sort of a backlash

31:36.960 --> 31:42.160
with people who are going very mask off on these on the israel-palestine situation and losing their

31:42.160 --> 31:47.040
jobs and suddenly it'll be like you can't cancel people over over your political beliefs and it's

31:47.040 --> 31:50.960
like well listen that's been happening for for years now to people who are right-leaning so

31:51.840 --> 31:57.040
i like i don't want anyone canceled either like either side right but if these are the rules of

31:57.040 --> 32:05.200
the game this is how it has to be you know i mean i i i don't have an issue with someone

32:05.840 --> 32:12.480
losing i i i don't think i have the same position over what y'all do i mean dev you have a video

32:12.480 --> 32:18.720
where you talk about uh the woman uh with the wig pulling right and how you didn't support uh

32:18.720 --> 32:24.160
i think the name of the video is uh what is it cancel culture is totalitarian or something like

32:24.160 --> 32:30.400
that and you're talking about this woman that basically uh this drunk white guy uh sees her

32:30.400 --> 32:36.560
on the street tries to pull her wig off uh in a really violent way clearly hurts her and uh she

32:36.560 --> 32:41.520
happens to film it and the guy ends up fired you're talking how you you don't support that

32:41.520 --> 32:48.160
um i actually don't really have a problem with that necessarily what i do have a problem with is

32:48.800 --> 32:55.040
and this is where i expect to get yelled at after this show is i have been against a certain set of

32:55.040 --> 33:02.320
tactics from the gamer gate era right i think it is wrong to dox people i think it's wrong to go

33:02.320 --> 33:07.920
through everything they've ever said publicly or privately and then try to use that to destroy

33:07.920 --> 33:13.840
their reputation i think death threats rape threats all that stuff should just be off the table

33:13.840 --> 33:21.200
right um and i want to be really honest and say that a decade ago i think gamer gate was doing

33:21.200 --> 33:25.840
that and i would imagine all three of us would probably agree today the people i personally see

33:25.840 --> 33:34.080
doing this the most are my own side and it just seems so crazy hypocritical of me that we decried

33:34.080 --> 33:40.240
all these tactics and now we've just embraced them as our core strategy does does that kind of make

33:40.240 --> 33:48.160
sense yep yep that's um uh fuck what was his name was it saw linsky i don't know the guy who wrote

33:48.160 --> 33:52.960
rules for radicals you wrote this book basically outlining what radical movements should do to take

33:52.960 --> 33:58.480
power and one of them one of the rules is just be as hypocritical as possible yeah do do the

33:58.480 --> 34:02.960
underhanded stuff and also accuse your opponents of doing it you know right so it's this is kind

34:02.960 --> 34:10.560
of how radical movements go as they radicalize but i mean you can't this is where i'm really torn a

34:10.560 --> 34:17.120
lot of the time because i do agree with the political the stated political goals of the

34:17.120 --> 34:23.600
progressive movement right uh you know i do want more acceptance for trans people i do want things

34:23.600 --> 34:27.920
to be better for women i do you know i've been on a wick panel before talking about my belief in

34:27.920 --> 34:32.000
like structural reparations for you know black people i think it's the only way we can move

34:32.000 --> 34:37.440
forward from the pain of the civil war so when it comes to a lot of these policies i'm right there

34:37.440 --> 34:44.480
on board where i'm feeling increasingly homeless is there is a standard i try to hold myself to

34:44.480 --> 34:51.760
professionally and how i behave and i just see a lot of my own side engaged in tactics it just

34:51.760 --> 34:56.880
i i don't know how to say it other than they feel evil to me to both of you and this is a very good

34:56.880 --> 35:01.120
question because i think we've both acknowledged or all of us have acknowledged that it's worse

35:01.120 --> 35:06.720
now right than it was 10 years ago it's worse value was 10 15 years ago um again i'm i'm a

35:06.720 --> 35:13.680
little older myself right and i was i was active online in the early 2000s and things like that

35:14.480 --> 35:17.840
very different very different environment for better or worse right there there's some things

35:17.840 --> 35:23.840
i don't want back from those days um however you don't want the xbox live chats back look

35:25.040 --> 35:31.280
we had some uh we had some fun times but those times are behind us um yeah uh we have grown up

35:31.280 --> 35:39.280
and grown out of those things um but i will ask well should we and how do we do so and that's my

35:39.280 --> 35:44.880
question is because it's it's very easy to get black pilled on this like these doxing

35:44.880 --> 35:50.720
tactics these um these just doubling down taxes this constant harassment it's been shown to work

35:50.720 --> 35:56.480
right it's been shown to be effective in getting the people you don't want to to be around not be

35:56.480 --> 36:01.600
around anymore it hasn't worked when it came to combating our ideas getting policies passed any

36:01.600 --> 36:07.840
of that but it's worked for what i think people really like and that's hurting others um so how

36:07.840 --> 36:15.840
do we how do we get passes can't we get passes is it is there a way to stop this spiral as i

36:15.840 --> 36:21.680
guess you'd call it or this uh this constant wave of tit for tat of reciprocal radicalization of

36:21.680 --> 36:25.520
if you use those tactics we're going to use those tactics 10 times as hard etc etc

36:25.520 --> 36:30.080
uh what what do we think i want dev to go first on this one and then i'll let you go

36:31.920 --> 36:36.160
oh man how do you how do you fix the problem that's uh that's a very if we're going to talk

36:36.160 --> 36:42.240
about the problem we gotta talk about how to fix it right yeah yeah um you have to

36:43.840 --> 36:48.720
it's it's a tall order not everyone's gonna be able to do it you have to be able to understand

36:48.720 --> 36:53.680
your your opponent's arguments all right you have to understand that like when a conservative

36:54.240 --> 36:58.640
you know expresses some sort of anti-trans opinion he doesn't actually want to kill all

36:58.640 --> 37:03.440
trans people and how you know how have the streets run red with the blood of trans people and

37:03.440 --> 37:08.480
outlaw no he's generally scared for his kids right and now you can think that it's wrong

37:08.480 --> 37:12.400
for him to be scared for his kids in that way and there's some good evidence that he probably

37:12.400 --> 37:19.600
is wrong but it's not it's not coming from a place of of evil right and there's also there's

37:19.600 --> 37:23.520
obviously inverted situations as well where like right wingers do not understand leftist point of

37:23.520 --> 37:30.160
views leftists don't understand right wing point of views um basically if you can't steal man your

37:30.160 --> 37:34.640
opponent's arguments you're you're not going to be able to sympathize with them when they

37:34.640 --> 37:37.040
have an emotional reaction to something that they think is bad

37:40.160 --> 37:46.080
so being able to steal men or wanting to steal but the problem is dev no one wants to do that

37:46.720 --> 37:53.520
i well i can't make them i mean so so there's this idea um like pre-internet you watch what was on

37:53.520 --> 37:58.400
tv maybe you could like rent a movie but like you watch what was on tv i would have never grown to

37:58.400 --> 38:05.280
love um to love martial arts films if i didn't watch them at 3 a.m by like sneaking downstairs

38:05.280 --> 38:11.600
as a kid right it was the only thing on um and i i had i think from 16 to 18 i had an

38:11.600 --> 38:15.440
insomnia so i couldn't sleep and i was just staying up all night watching these martial arts films

38:15.440 --> 38:22.160
because that's all i could do right um it's one of those things where as technological

38:22.160 --> 38:28.160
advancement has increased and we have more access to netflix for example we never have

38:28.160 --> 38:31.760
to be exposed to anything we don't like ever again which is nice because we don't want to

38:31.760 --> 38:35.120
interact with things that we hate but also it means that we never actually discover anything new

38:35.840 --> 38:41.920
so if you take that principle you apply it to political echo chambers people don't watch videos

38:41.920 --> 38:46.480
or read books or entertain ideas from other political camps because they don't have to anymore

38:46.480 --> 38:50.960
you know if you're a leftist you can go on youtube and watch an infinite amount of leftist content

38:50.960 --> 38:55.840
and never be exposed to a right-wing idea and same same the other way around right there's

38:56.560 --> 38:59.920
there's it's it sounds very strange but there's like there's too much access

39:00.480 --> 39:06.880
and you know the the um the white pillar in me wants to say that well no people can be trusted

39:06.880 --> 39:13.280
to diversify their their their media intake and understand what other people think and there are

39:13.280 --> 39:18.960
some people who have for sure but it seems like most people just aren't doing it it's uh i think

39:18.960 --> 39:26.240
that's oh i think that's go ahead no no i was just gonna say yeah like i know that you know

39:26.240 --> 39:33.200
i've told you this in dms i am better at my job because i watch your videos and i do think because

39:33.200 --> 39:42.080
you have such a salient uh brutal fair critique of the left i think it makes me stronger to watch

39:42.080 --> 39:48.240
that critique and figure out what the answer is right so i agree with you that uh this tendency

39:48.240 --> 39:54.720
for all of us to never listen to something on the other side it makes us weak it makes us unable to

39:54.720 --> 40:02.000
function um and one of the reasons i really respect uh destiny a lot is i think more than

40:02.000 --> 40:07.680
anyone else out there yeah look let's be clear he makes a lot of sweaty gamer comments he can

40:07.680 --> 40:13.040
certainly tend towards being hyperbolic uh but i also think one of the good things he does is he

40:13.040 --> 40:20.320
teaches people how to think i think when people make claims uh he really encourages his audience

40:20.320 --> 40:26.000
to look through that to think through it uh before responding and to really really do your research

40:26.000 --> 40:33.120
before having really strong opinions um i think that's a really good example um one of the things

40:33.120 --> 40:40.720
i think has really really changed over my lifetime is this democratization of information i'm just

40:40.720 --> 40:47.200
barely old enough to remember when you could get uh your news and it had to be on either cable or

40:47.200 --> 40:52.320
the printed newspaper that came to your house every single day and that had a lot of downsides

40:52.320 --> 40:58.480
you know you didn't hear about a lot of stories about gay people in uh that time period you know

40:58.480 --> 41:04.240
the the the makeup of the newsrooms had huge implications for how things were covered which

41:04.240 --> 41:09.360
is why i think we can look at public policy and the conversations we are not having about issues

41:09.360 --> 41:15.440
like structural racism back in the 90s and see how simple they were compared to today that is a

41:15.440 --> 41:22.720
bad thing but something was really good about that that i think is really really um under acknowledged

41:22.720 --> 41:30.720
today is in the newspaper and cable news era of public information that did go through someone

41:30.720 --> 41:37.600
at the top that was mature that was thoughtful that generally took some time to make sure the

41:37.600 --> 41:46.720
stuff there was mostly accurate and did represent both sides um today we have no incentives for

41:46.720 --> 41:53.760
any of that and i think we're much weaker as a society i think a direct reason we're seeing such

41:53.760 --> 42:02.720
a stupid analysis on um on foreign policy issues today is we have now two generation of americans

42:02.720 --> 42:08.160
they've never heard any position other than america is bad and our foreign policy is always

42:08.160 --> 42:12.720
wrong and the world is a little bit more complicated than that even though we've made

42:12.720 --> 42:20.560
plenty of foreign policy mistakes so i think that a really important thing is for america to take

42:20.560 --> 42:27.600
more of a role in thinking about how this information landscape is influencing us right

42:27.600 --> 42:32.880
we've got to protect free speech we've got to protect open expression but i also think we've

42:32.880 --> 42:38.240
lost control the way people get their information to a mob and i don't think it's serving our

42:38.240 --> 42:46.160
country well yeah so you're getting at like the post-truth era yeah if you know the post-modern

42:46.160 --> 42:53.280
post-truth era yeah so it's it's like well can you trust cnn well i mean maybe you know they're

42:53.280 --> 42:56.480
a decently big institution there's a lot of moving parts lots of people there but like

42:56.480 --> 43:00.160
what if they're all compromised right well can you trust fox well maybe not like these are big

43:00.160 --> 43:03.440
corporations and if you don't trust corporations because they're corporate you know maybe you want

43:03.440 --> 43:07.520
to go somewhere else you know do you trust tim pool or do you trust like some some smaller site

43:07.520 --> 43:11.840
do you trust some really fringe one like zero hedge or something because there's there's

43:11.840 --> 43:15.920
utility and looking at the small guys too because they don't have corporate interests but they but

43:15.920 --> 43:19.440
now they have like personal interests and they're and they're probably more radical than the

43:19.440 --> 43:25.920
mainstream guys like anything can be tainted with some form of bias you know any company

43:25.920 --> 43:30.080
any individual any institution so who do you trust and then you get to a point where it's

43:30.080 --> 43:35.760
like well do you trust anything at all like i've i i've never been to antarctica so how do i know

43:35.760 --> 43:40.400
that it actually exists right like it could be an entire like a huge psyop the entire world's

43:40.400 --> 43:45.200
playing on me you can you can go down a rabbit hole joke about this but there are some people

43:45.200 --> 43:53.040
there's a growing well it's not growing that fast but there is a portion of people who do just

43:53.600 --> 44:00.880
don't trust anything any institution is suspect any fact is suspect look at the denialism that

44:00.880 --> 44:07.840
has come out after october 7th of the things that everyone saw on video and suddenly there's

44:07.840 --> 44:13.200
there's people with millions of followers with hundreds of thousands of likes on their shot shit

44:13.200 --> 44:19.040
just making shit up and saying it and uh it gets more likes than the truth right and

44:19.920 --> 44:26.160
yeah how do you how do you fix that because brianna woo like uh respectfully like there were

44:26.160 --> 44:31.360
a lot of problems back when we had so much gatekeeping right like there's it held us back

44:31.360 --> 44:38.560
so much and i don't know if we want or can go back to that style of having some kind of um

44:39.440 --> 44:46.240
person on the top a uh uh some elite deciding what we can and can't like what i don't want

44:46.240 --> 44:53.600
that right and that's not why i'm advocating i'm saying that i'm saying that every system has

44:53.600 --> 44:59.680
upsides and downsides right a really big upside that system is there was an editor involved and

44:59.680 --> 45:04.480
i think the fact that editor is no longer involved today is a real downside for how we are getting

45:04.480 --> 45:13.920
information so you know like i think i think the fact that all of these algorithms exist to

45:13.920 --> 45:19.200
addict you like they literally keep psychologists on staff to figure out how to addict you

45:19.840 --> 45:24.800
i i don't have an immediate answer for this but i wonder if there's a role for us to take a more

45:24.800 --> 45:34.080
active um in a regulatory position in asking how is so much social media affecting people's brains

45:34.080 --> 45:40.720
right uh when the facebook whistleblower came out you know she was giving all kinds of instances

45:40.720 --> 45:46.080
from facebook's own internal studies about what instagram is doing to an entire generation of

45:46.080 --> 45:50.560
young women's brains and it's it's terrible it's upping their suicidality it's destroying their

45:50.560 --> 45:56.960
body image it's leading to mental health issues i mean it's just across the board it's really really

45:56.960 --> 46:03.840
bad and i just i'm not gonna tell you i have easy answers for this right now because all of these

46:03.840 --> 46:10.320
problems are multi-factorial but i do think the fact that we've just basically seeded all of this

46:10.800 --> 46:16.160
we've said we're not gonna take any role in this whatsoever i do think that's adding to the the

46:16.160 --> 46:22.720
the instability that is really putting democracy at risk yeah you see there's like a there's another

46:23.440 --> 46:26.720
i i mostly agree with you but there's a different way to kind of phrase it right

46:27.520 --> 46:32.720
the downside of democratization is that people are generally retarded right and that's that's

46:32.720 --> 46:39.360
just that's just how it is right you know man i okay i remember during the height of let's say

46:39.360 --> 46:43.760
covid paranoia not to imply that covid wasn't real or anything i'm not going down that rabbit hole

46:43.760 --> 46:47.600
okay i was about to say come on man i'm trying to keep my content monetized like

46:48.640 --> 46:55.200
no no no but like there were people i remember some one person specifically said you need to

46:55.200 --> 47:00.480
respect democracy and trust the experts and i'm like hold on those are two completely opposing

47:00.480 --> 47:06.560
values because an expert opinion is specifically non-democratic it's the opinion of a learned

47:06.560 --> 47:12.640
minority that is informing the unlearned majority right so when you have democratization you do

47:12.640 --> 47:18.400
hear from more voices and that can be a good thing but also like special specialization is like is

47:18.400 --> 47:23.040
like i don't know what the word is there there's something that is anti-democratic but also

47:23.040 --> 47:29.920
necessary in society in order to actually try to ascertain what the truth is the the only issue is

47:29.920 --> 47:35.760
like how can you trust that right it's we are in a quagmire like i have no solutions to this problem

47:36.320 --> 47:42.960
i just know that at least on a local scale like within your own personal life if you do your best

47:42.960 --> 47:48.320
to tell the truth you can make things at least somewhat better better for you and better for

47:48.320 --> 47:52.720
people around you you know if you have a platform better for those who listen in on your platform if

47:52.720 --> 47:58.240
you're allowed to be honest yes but i think one of the major problems with these platforms are

47:58.240 --> 48:02.160
people are not allowed to be honest can we look can we talk about for a moment right i know this

48:02.160 --> 48:10.880
is maybe off topic but this is bothering me ethan klein and hamas pipe oh i guess not uh give me a

48:10.880 --> 48:23.280
second hopefully she ran away soon um i didn't kick her out gang wonder if she uh i hope her

48:23.280 --> 48:31.280
internet's okay um we'll give it a second um in the meantime uh gang if you're enjoying this

48:31.280 --> 48:35.920
content uh hit that like button hit that subscribe button uh feel free to follow me on twitch or

48:35.920 --> 48:42.080

bits at me uh give me subs throw super chats i'll read one super chat now from testicle johnson for

48:47.440 --> 48:53.200
five dollars i think all the chicks i think all chicks in video games should have thin

48:53.200 --> 48:57.200
wastes and massive tits and all the dude should have five percent body fat everyone should feel

48:57.200 --> 49:02.560
bad ten dollars from zephyr hash to say at dev i get what you're saying but how long are we

49:02.560 --> 49:06.320
supposed to wait and how much energy are we supposed to put into making sure everyone

49:06.320 --> 49:11.440
understands our point of view specific specifically when time is of the essence

49:11.440 --> 49:18.480
and also welcome back brianne hi uh my computer is restarting uh so i'm on my phone so sorry

49:18.480 --> 49:24.080
no it's okay do your thing uh let's get a scheduled windows update that got you i have no

49:24.080 --> 49:31.040
ideas well i'm just glad you're back and we were wondering if uh if finally the leftist mob had

49:31.040 --> 49:36.080
come for you right like that this was your time and we were going to be like hearing news reports

49:36.080 --> 49:41.200
or something of suddenly sunday uh found your location and his mob descended upon you i don't

49:41.200 --> 49:47.200
know right uh yeah wick i've heard that you've you've had a beef with president sunday recently

49:47.440 --> 49:54.800
what's that all about um he made some uh he keeps making shit up and going after people um he told

49:54.800 --> 50:03.200
aristocracy that she needed to calm down after october 7th and made some very very um untoward

50:03.200 --> 50:09.440
comments i called him out on that and here we are um there there are some people like i will

50:09.440 --> 50:12.640
talk with pretty much anyone you know i'll talk with very far left people i'll talk with very

50:12.640 --> 50:16.480
far right people um the people i won't talk with are the people who actually take it offline

50:16.480 --> 50:22.400
right so i'll never speak uh okay i'll never speak to president sunday i'll never speak to

50:22.400 --> 50:27.840
uh ethan ralph i'll never speak nick fuentes people who actually try to like get get your

50:27.840 --> 50:32.080
get your stuff fucked up i will never talk to those people because that's that's too far for

50:32.080 --> 50:36.800
me well i had a i had a gentleman um i this wasn't sunday to be clear it was someone else i know who

50:36.800 --> 50:42.960
it was um recently um basically told me he's going to try to get my channel taken away uh he got me a

50:42.960 --> 50:50.240
warning um uh on twitch the other day because i unfortunately forgot that uh one of my guests was

50:50.240 --> 50:58.080
banned from twitch and uh but they they remembered and so i took a ding from that but yeah there are

50:58.080 --> 51:03.040
people who will just sit on my shit wait for me to break toss and it is what it is yep same here

51:03.600 --> 51:10.640
i mean this is really i think this is really a very serious problem where um one of the things

51:10.640 --> 51:17.600
i have really found recently is i've i've really really enjoyed spending more time uh reaching out

51:17.600 --> 51:23.280
and talking to people in the right wing right like i debated uh john doyle at the the university

51:23.280 --> 51:29.120
of south carolina just a couple of days ago i did tim pool show uh you know dev i know i speak for

51:29.120 --> 51:33.520
myself but i'm really enjoying speaking with you tonight you know uh despite you know our history

51:33.520 --> 51:38.480
of gamergate and i i just i don't know we're talking about gamergate eventually the chat

51:39.360 --> 51:46.480
we will get to that but before we do we'll finish we'll finish my point yeah go ahead what i was

51:46.480 --> 51:54.160
going to say is i don't know when we got so afraid to actually talk about ideas right um it really

51:54.160 --> 52:02.560
feels like the left our top answer for stuff nowadays is to um just refuse to engage with

52:02.560 --> 52:10.320
anything that's unpleasant right and it's not i understand that often there's some ideas that

52:10.320 --> 52:16.800
just are not worth responding to um like i think we would want to take the the like a policy

52:16.800 --> 52:22.560
proposal of a holocaust in the united states uh seriously or give that air time but for a lot of

52:22.560 --> 52:28.560
the stuff we talk about um i i think it's so counterproductive the way we won't engage it on

52:28.560 --> 52:35.440
its merits just before the show uh i was watching ethan and hasan debate and ethan really having

52:35.440 --> 52:41.920
some very salient points about why one state solution would not work for israel right and uh

52:41.920 --> 52:48.240
just hasan would not engage with that in any honest way that's a that that that sticks on the

52:48.240 --> 52:51.920
point that i wanted to bring up before you had your computer issues uh first of all your camera

52:51.920 --> 52:57.520
isn't up so if uh i don't know oh apologize yeah i just didn't know you know um

52:59.840 --> 53:05.840
let's talk about ethan and asan right because dev made the point that we need to be improve our uh

53:05.840 --> 53:11.520
improve our areas of the internet by being honest ourselves so that and so my my question on this

53:11.520 --> 53:18.000
my uh tack on this is i don't know if we are going to be allowed to do that right and i think the way

53:18.000 --> 53:23.760
that ethan klein has been treated uh over his what is this the third fourth discussion he's

53:23.760 --> 53:32.720
had with us on over all this right to see the vitriol my timeline has put on ethan for simply

53:33.680 --> 53:39.760
being upset that a bunch of people like for having pretty normie takes right you can say they're

53:39.760 --> 53:45.840
wrong or whatever but he's just being honest like you can't say that this guy's lying about this he's

53:45.840 --> 53:52.480
being honest and to see the way that he is just being excoriated that he is losing respect

53:52.480 --> 53:58.480
viewership etc to be being raked over the coals he was forced to apologize right to someone who

53:58.480 --> 54:05.920
had offended him like uh it's it's it's wild to me and i don't see it getting better i think this is

54:05.920 --> 54:12.960
kind of at least for the the foreseeable future the new norm you are not allowed to be honest

54:12.960 --> 54:18.720
because if you are that platform or that space you have will be taken from you um what do you

54:18.720 --> 54:26.000
think well kind of like like sargon's still around right he's certainly not on the left

54:26.000 --> 54:30.720
he's something further to write than me he thinks i'm a communist for example which i'm not obviously

54:30.720 --> 54:34.560
but he's he's he's but like we're still good friends though even though if you have political

54:34.560 --> 54:40.400
differences we're still we're still pals um but he still has he's like he exists outside of the

54:40.400 --> 54:45.360
leftist internet bubble and he still exists you know he he opened his uh his think tank and he

54:45.360 --> 54:49.920
has like a dozen employees and he's doing his thing so there's definitely ways for you to

54:50.720 --> 54:56.560
exist outside of like internet leftism i think i think you can still you can still you know speak

54:56.560 --> 55:02.000
the truth if you're not in that bubble it's hard for people who are though because you know i've

55:02.000 --> 55:05.840
seen a lot of people who are you know they're like center left you know like someone like stardust

55:05.840 --> 55:10.080
right get into lots of trouble with some people for for speaking out against the far left

55:10.720 --> 55:18.880
um hmm i i have a very black-pilled opinion on this oh no i hope maybe i can be white-pilled

55:18.880 --> 55:28.880
on it one day but i think i think there's this view i think there's this view on the left

55:28.880 --> 55:35.040
that because so much of of academia is leftist that the right just has no worthwhile ideas to

55:35.040 --> 55:39.520
consider which isn't true there there's there's there's some decent right-wing literature out

55:39.520 --> 55:43.680
there for sure that's worth reading i'm going to put a pin in that because i want to ask who

55:43.680 --> 55:51.200
who what's the best right-wing opinion out there right now well so one of the things i you know i

55:51.200 --> 55:57.520
was very very young uh i had to get over my you know religious right mississippi indoctrination

55:57.520 --> 56:02.720
and i look back on that actually and see it as my superpower there are a lot of things uh that i

56:02.720 --> 56:08.640
took from that that i think are very advantageous in my professional career um i think that the

56:08.640 --> 56:16.480
right has some ideas about personal responsibility that are just just true they they are like um a

56:16.480 --> 56:20.560
responsibility to solve your own problems i'll give you a really concrete example when it comes

56:20.560 --> 56:26.560
to drug addiction one of the things like i just celebrated 20 years this is bryony right you have

56:26.560 --> 56:33.920
noticed when you talk to left-wing friends their top um thing they suggest on this is not judging

56:33.920 --> 56:40.240
let's get aa out of the mix because they are uh you know they're a non-secular organization all

56:40.240 --> 56:46.800
of this and i can tell you the the thing that is most helpful for getting over a drug addiction

56:46.800 --> 56:53.920
is accountability structure standards and frankly really harsh consequences when you fail

56:54.560 --> 57:00.080
you know this is the reason drug courts are so effective right so i think that the right does

57:00.080 --> 57:05.680
have some really common sense ideas that make less sense about how to get to where you want

57:05.680 --> 57:10.880
to go in life sorry for the interruption dev i just i wanted to see what we would have to say

57:10.880 --> 57:19.280
on that but carry on please right wing ideas the part okay you know where you're at um you you just

57:19.280 --> 57:25.840
mentioned something about um getting away from aa right okay right and earlier you mentioned

57:25.840 --> 57:31.280
refusing to engage with unpleasantness yeah something yeah okay so there's something i've

57:31.280 --> 57:36.160
been i've been thinking about and and i had a conversation with sitch like six months ago that

57:36.160 --> 57:40.880
kind of sparked this idea in me and i've really been going over um wick i know that you know about

57:40.880 --> 57:47.840
height moral foundations yes um rihanna do you know about i don't i apologize okay it's a

57:47.840 --> 57:52.560
psychology thing um jonathan hight did did research into the psychology of morality

57:52.560 --> 57:57.280
and he basically pointed out that there's there's six dimensions across which humans

57:57.280 --> 58:01.360
judge things to be moral or immoral and i just pull up i'll just pull up here real quick

58:04.160 --> 58:11.360
okay that's uh care and harm fairness and cheating loyalty and betrayal authority and

58:11.360 --> 58:18.560
subversion sanctity and degradation liberty and oppression and what he found with his research

58:18.560 --> 58:26.880
is that you have certain political views map onto certain um certain moral foundations which

58:26.880 --> 58:33.360
are more more or less important to the individual and also certain personality types so when you

58:33.360 --> 58:38.000
have what what you found is that when you talk to someone who's very very progressive they tend to

58:38.000 --> 58:45.280
basically only to care about care and harm right so maximizing care avoiding harm can you name the

58:45.280 --> 58:51.680
other four really quickly so i can contrast that in my mind um it's care harm fairness cheating

58:52.480 --> 59:01.280
loyalty betrayal authority subversion sanctity degradation liberty oppression and those are the

59:01.280 --> 59:08.960
six would uh i mean i mean we can see the liberty oppression right the oppressor what's the

59:08.960 --> 59:14.320
difference between liberty impression and oppressor oppressed dynamic because the left is famous for

59:14.320 --> 59:19.840
oppressor oppressed dynamics internal well in his research he found that socialists do tend to

59:19.840 --> 59:27.040
value liberty and oppression progressives value it less than socialists um okay yeah but also like

59:27.040 --> 59:33.040
like um uh fascists value authority overwhelmingly other than the other than the other five um you

59:33.040 --> 59:39.200
find that conservatives tend to value loyalty more um religious people tend to value sanctity more

59:39.200 --> 59:44.000
and progressives tend to value care and harm more liberals just like normally like central

59:44.000 --> 59:48.880
centrist liberals tend to value fairness more right so you you have these different views of

59:48.880 --> 59:55.840
morality that map onto different views of politics and i've seen so many very very progressive people

59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.400
talk about like like harm reduction harm reduction is a great example harm reduction is like the

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.520
let's um let's not be so harsh on people who have drug addictions will give them like safe supplies

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:10.480
of heroin as if you ever have such a thing which is a good pro no needle programs do work we have

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:17.600
a lot of data about that yeah but like you also don't want to enable someone's addiction you don't

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:23.760
want it like like you you do want to have them to not be addicts first and foremost right sure but

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.840
i mean being out on the street like you know using dirty needles and getting all kinds of terrible

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.360
diseases it costs the public a ton of money it's not doing the many favors and it's an opportunity

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:41.360
to talk about getting them into treatment right that's true that's all true however you know if

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.840
if you have a different moral way of looking at it you might ask the question well i don't want to

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:53.520
be the person who gives a druggie some drugs that would not be obviously yeah yeah so so i agree

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.160
with you yes yeah so like there's there's different ways to view it right but you know with

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.520
with harm reduction does come the sense of if we just reduce as much harm as possible because

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.720
things are so like things are so terrible just just we have to reduce harm reduce harm you know

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.920
we can't worry about anything else just reduce the harm it's like well you're not building anything

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.080
virtuous there it's like yeah okay you're reducing harm but you're just like lessening the negative

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:22.880
you're not making anything positive if that makes sense so there's because you mentioned um aa and

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:30.080
aa has a religious component if you believe that religion is negative a net negative for society

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.600
then you might have the opinion of well i'm just gonna say fuck aa because it has these other

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:43.360
negative things that come along with it because i want i want the perfect answer and right isn't it

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.680
you know is this reflected just real quick and like the people who are critical of mr base who

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.120
built 100 wells or cured blindness and a thousand people and say well that's part of it because you

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:59.040
haven't fixed the structural issues you've just enabled the structural issues to keep uh to keep

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.880
going and your charity is actually uh causing long-term harm so yeah is that that's like that

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.920
that's part of it there's also another aspect of that though um that comes out of um angles

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.520
writing angles a socialist and marks and angles you know angle angles wrote about how basically

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:22.400
charity is evil because it is given at the discretion of the capitalist of the rich person

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.840
so he can make himself feel good by giving money to solve problems that he caused and it's like

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.960
well that's just ridiculous but it's like well i don't even agree with that point of view but

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.600
even if that were the truth it's still good to give the money right like the charity still has

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.240
its place but but it was his view that like well no the working class deserves the money so if you

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.320
if if a rich person gives it to them they're doing the bare minimum and you can't you can't give them

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.560
any sort of positive feedback for that and it's like well that seems almost sociopathic to me

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.480
can i circle around about something you were talking about because aa is a really good example

01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:01.360
i think about this feeling of utopianism on the left and how this is so poorly i think it results

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:09.120
in really bad public policy so from my perspective my home state of mississippi has no resources

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:14.160
almost for drug addiction right i was very fortunate to have a family that could afford

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:21.120
to send me to thirty thousand dollar live at the rehab like therapy for you know two months

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.040
like and paid that out of pocket my god was i lucky about that but most people don't right

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.120
it's not going to surprise you mississippi does not have uh free for everyone drug and alcohol

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.960
uh uh treatment programs on the corner they do have a lot of churches that will lend space for

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:46.160
people so aa has a principle where you don't have to make god your higher power you can make aa

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.720
your higher power you can make spiritualism your higher power doesn't matter what you want to make

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.160
there are secular ways to do that and they are literally i see my own side talking about aa

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:04.880
as if this utopian let's make everything secular that itself is the goal the goal is not give

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:12.080
people that are addicted to drugs and alcohol a path to treatment and sobriety the goal is to be

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:18.800
morally pure and it's just so counterproductive i know more people that got sober from aa than i

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:25.120
do from rehab matthew perry in his book before he died have wonderful things to say about aa and i

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:32.000
just this is just this tendency of of having to have a perfect solution that i don't think is

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.080
resulting in good public policy yeah yeah and i think that that comes from heights moral

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.960
foundations right so i mean it's it's it's on wikipedia it's a pretty well-known idea if you

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.360
want to look at it in depth but basically like when you have two different people with two

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.320
different moral foundations you know one of them cares about care harm the other one cares about

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.360
you know loyalty betrayal so that would be like a progressive and a conservative

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.480
you put those two together they're going to view each other as immoral and not because one of them

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.040
is necessarily right and one is necessarily wrong but because they have different psychology right

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.480
so so the progressive might say hey you're hurting people with your behavior you should stop that

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.440
because we should be maximizing for care and the conservative might say you're betraying somebody

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.360
and we should stop that we should be maximizing for loyalty right so they're going to have

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.200
different they almost like it's almost like they speak a different moral language when they're

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.080
oh we do i i don't know if you've ever read this book what is the name of it it's talking about

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.360
the psychology of republicans and why um they kind of tend towards authoritarianism in ways

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.880
that the left doesn't but there is there's a like something i think that's really underappreciated

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.240
on the left is how the the foundation of how conservatives think really starts with this idea

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:51.520
of a a father figure in the home whose job it is to protect the family from harm in a lot of of

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:57.600
their of terrible ways right and that's making decisions listening providing like that's just

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.680
kind of the moral foundation of how a lot of conservatives think and i i see so many people

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:08.960
on my own side sneering at that but i think they're really out of touch with how a large part

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.240
of the country uh just views itself and what those relationships are like i don't know if

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:21.040
that's true um and let let's let's if if i may if you'll give me the title of the book if you'll

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:28.240
give me a minute yeah yeah it was a bestseller book but my my this idea that the right is

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:35.520
just tends towards more authoritarianism than the left i uh i don't know i don't it might be true

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.880
but i've seen a lot of authoritarian lefties in my day maybe it's a selection bias but i

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:45.920
hear this is an excellent book i highly recommend what's it called again republican brain by chris

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:54.000
mooney okay it is look i i think it's very clear like in recent events that the left is not pure

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.120
of this completely right but there is just more of a tendency it depends so there's like two

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.920
different types of authoritarianism right so there's like the autocratic authoritarian so the

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.080
the the strong man the person who who consolidates power into himself so that would be like the

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.440
fascist leader or the monarch you know the the singular strong entity but then on the left you

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:21.120
have like you have like democratic tyranny where it's it's mob rule and it's just simply by what

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.920
the majority wants which can also be very destructive so it's two different types of

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:34.240
authoritarianism i think yeah even then though right there are uh portions of the left um

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:41.520
though i guess some more authoritarian portions um that are democratic to an extent but then they

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.240
say something should never be voted on and it happens to be their most important uh values

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:51.280
as they think right like that yeah and so i don't i don't i don't know i don't know i'd have to look

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.920
into it more um i'm i well i i think i think that's just a practical necessity of obtaining

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.240
and wielding power you know that's just kind of how it has to be oh speaking of practical

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:08.320
necessities and uh retaining and wielding power and things like that um what do we think if i may

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.000
get your guys to i i see you chat i see you chat i know you want to talk about the gamer gate thing

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.960
i will ask a question about gamer gate thing i will i promise but let me let's let's let's save

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.600
it for the end to say about gamer gate is there anything new to say well we haven't sent it to

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.600
each other exactly exactly we will bury this hatchet but first right i am gonna spoil i i'm

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:35.520
not gonna get in a fight tonight i'm just not okay that's that's fine that's fine um but let

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:45.440
me ask this question instead uh for now um what do we think is the most likely outcome of this

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:51.440
upcoming election so tuesday we got a glimpse i think of where at least policy-wise the electorate's

01:08:51.440 --> 01:09:00.560
at right now uh republicans got thrashed um ohio um formalized abortion and it's a uh a codified

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:08.400
abortion i should say and it's a constitution uh the virginia or the kentucky i should say the

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.280
kentucky governor won reelection he's a democrat uh almost across the board democrats had a really

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:19.600
good night um we could juxtapose that with the doom and gloom we saw on social media about how

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.520
people never vote democrat never vote for biden never vote for anyone um that isn't calling for

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:32.240
a ceasefire etc etc etc um but do we think that this uh constant calls will have an effect going

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:39.440
forward on the 2024 election these constant calls to just boycott um biden boycott um the left or

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:45.840
anything or or is this all just hot air i gotta be honest i have not paid attention to american

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.320
politics in the past week or so so i don't know what you're useless to me okay fair enough sorry

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:58.160
whoo go ahead uh i i think it's very serious um you know uh i i think as part of my job i did look

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.920
a lot at the the outcome from tuesday obviously i'm happy when democrats win uh don't read too

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:10.480
much into it okay just don't uh biden's poll numbers are extremely weak right now we're seeing

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.920
the number of muslims that are currently planning to vote for him i'm not talking

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.600
to twitter conversations i'm talking about real polls uh it's not a good situation uh his numbers

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.800
with jewish people are down as well uh if the election were held today joe biden would lose

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:31.200
by a lot and joe mansion is not deciding not to run again because he's tired of having power

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.800
he's not running again because he's looking at biden uh he's seeing a path for him to win the

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:43.680
presidency this is extremely obvious and we need to take this really seriously the reason biden is

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:50.640
failing right now in the polls is the first best job of the president is to lead on messaging

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:58.080
and look i think he's been a really consequential president but he um he is older and it affects

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.680
his ability to give speeches and connect emotionally with the with the public and um

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:10.400
his current strategy of hiding is not working out uh his uh you know his campaign has 91 million

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:16.960
dollars on hand the last time i checked uh they need to be investing massively uh across the board

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:24.800
in messaging and helping set a new conversation in my view yeah i mean biden's kind of a zombie

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.080
at this point he's he's really old it's there's no way to remedy that when you're that old you're

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.240
just you're just kind of done to be honest at the same time like there have been some some things to

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.840
come out of his administration that i like i really like the chips act yeah yeah i have always i've

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.760
been i feel like i'm a hipster when it comes to china i was where i was worried about them before

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.080
it was cool to be worried about china but um like there's been some if you if you stay plugged into

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.200
like the right wing online ecosystem you you'd think that the world's completely falling apart

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.720
and it's not there's some problems but it's not nearly that bad um but i do think that biden just

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:07.120
i think based almost solely on his age and now maybe on the october 7th response like he might

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.000
not be the guy for for the democrats but at the same time um the republicans are in shambles as

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.880
well you know all of those republican primaries are basically just the the the debate of who is

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:26.880
going to eventually lose to trump and trump seems to be he he's not a very good president

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.760
and he's also extremely popular on the right yeah so gotta get more serious

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:39.040
yeah okay i mean it it's the man trump's like a wild card right now right because for 2024

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.960
imagine the possibility of trump wins the election and then also gets convicted on one of

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:52.960
those one of those charges what a shit show oh my holy shit but like if trump's gone you know if if

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.120
he if he actually is found guilty and he's locked away and he can't be president like who do the

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:04.800
republicans have i i think this is what rhonda santis is hoping for just a miracle at this point

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.960
so um yeah yeah i don't think they rally around this but anyway i don't want to get too much into

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.080
finish your thought uh dev and uh basically if we're just talking strategy de santis should

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.560
have waited he should have waited for trump's i like to for trump to finally be either vanquished

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.560
or get a second term and then come along next time this was not the time for i think i think

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:30.560
de santis basically destroyed his political career jumping in maybe um i know that uh

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:36.480
it would be an open question at this point right who would take that uh standard from

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.000
trump trump goes away unfortunately i don't think trump's going away i think that uh whoever

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:50.560
that biden will be facing trump in the 2024 runoff um and we'll see uh i i see the polling today

01:13:50.560 --> 01:14:00.240
the polling isn't uh it isn't comforting not to say the least but years a long time years a long

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.200
time i guess to to kind of maybe bring it into something that you have been following

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:12.800
um we've seen israel's messaging um of light how do you think they're doing dev do you see the

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.400
snl style skit they did the other day no i didn't see that either you didn't dev what are you are

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.800
you not paying attention to anything i've been away for a little bit i've been away for a little

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:31.280
bit sorry oh you're killing me bro you kill me okay um i i do know that like man when it comes

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:38.240
to the the israel-palestine conflict as a whole i'm like soft pro-israel but soft pro-israel you

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:44.720
know but man it's that's that's just that's just a shit show you have basically two sides that

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.480
i think beneath the mask they both want to genocide each other and one side is capable

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.360
of doing it the other side if the power balance were reversed they would be doing it so it's like

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.840
well like what the fuck you're gonna do at that point i don't think there's much that that the

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:07.440
west can do frankly i think it's like a hopeless situation fair enough i think we are seeing i was

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.280
talking to a really good uh jewish friend of mine about this about why there's such a generational

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:20.000
divide on on israel right now and i think it really comes down to the fact you know my friend

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.960
i believe he's in his uh 60s you know i'm in my 40s and yet we're both old enough to remember when

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:33.280
israel was really making a public messaging push and trying to help the public understand

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.880
why like the need for israel to exist was important you know things like that right now

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:45.360
we're really seeing one side uh make that case particularly to the left and uh you know i think

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:51.760
that when israel comes out and uh their response to a whole bunch of civilians getting killed in a

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:59.040
a strike that hits a hospital uh to basically kill one person it's like civilians die in war

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:05.040
which is nearly a direct paraphrase of what they said um you know it's it's really bad

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:13.280
messaging right um so i think uh anyone serious about uh national security will tell you that

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.160
um you're weighing the hearts and minds of people helping them understand and empathize with you is

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:23.520
a really critical part of that i think under netanyahu uh they're basically running the exact

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:30.160
same playbook that bush did which is harder right harder fringe messaging doing it in really moral

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.680
terms and not really making that effort to make the same number of friends so uh no wick i think

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:42.400
uh israel has been really really bad at messaging lately and i think if they don't change course i

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.920
think it's going to be there's going to be less and less willpower in washington to support them

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:55.920
and certainly all this uh you know horrific inexcusable level of civilian death is not

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:04.320
aiding that either so um i think they're i think it's really dire it has been a kind of like a mind

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:11.520
fuck almost yeah to watch the horrific images coming out of gaza um coming out of the airstrikes

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:20.800
and things like and then to have israel um put out an snl skit about it right um and you're like

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:29.520
someone is making these decisions consciously like is someone that they need to replace whoever

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:35.120
is in charge of that i understand why they're doing it i understand why they think they need

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.800
to use memes and comedy to appeal to the youth because as polling recently has shown

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:49.440
to put it mildly israel has a youth problem here in the west um they have been bleeding

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:58.080
support um from like again it's it's just a thing we grew up knowing that america supports israel

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.200
but i don't know if that's going to be the same in 20 years from now right

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:10.240
as the new cohort takes power and seeing not only the online response but also the polling also uh

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:17.600
the massive amounts of youth young people going into the streets not just saying free palestine

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:25.840
but gas the jews kill the jews israel needs to be destroyed intifada intifada from britain to gaza

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:34.480
right um there is a problem here um and i think israel knows it has to try to

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:41.840
reverse that trend i just don't think it knows how um what do you think that was just a public

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:48.720
messaging problem i think that you know look netanyahu and lakud party i mean they've taken

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.200
israel in a very very right wing direction and i think anyone that's being paid anyone that's

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.120
been paying attention to this including i would say the majority of jews in this country have

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:04.560
been increasingly um disturbed by the foreign policy direction of israel for quite a while

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.520
right so i certainly see that i don't think it's just a messaging problem i think it's

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:15.200
actually kind of analogous to america's reputation in the world following the iraq war right you know

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.720
no no any thoughts on this dad before we move on

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:27.280
if i were to like put myself in the headspace of somebody who let's say is very pro israel

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:34.800
who's who's in israel and is very pro israel i it feels like what they're probably thinking

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:42.320
is something like they saw what happened on october 7th and they saw all the memes come out

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:48.320
about paragliders and they're like oh okay so i guess we're just cool with killing civilians

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.160
and memeing about it now and so they're saying well then let's do that for our side

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.200
fair enough i don't think i think they real they they don't realize though that's not how

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:05.440
how the game works here we don't yeah it's not it's not tit for tat it's um we do it to egg you

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.160
on so that when you do it we can call you out for it and ignore that we did it too and then just

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.560
paint you as the worst actor ever uh fair enough uh let me read a super chat i got for you and then

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:22.000
we'll move on to the next question 10 bucks from lives and dev's walls i'm assuming it's someone

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.040
from your community sir yes how do we restore faith in or the integrity of necessary institutions

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.800
amid clear failures stopping the spread of ludicrous conspiracies requires viable claims

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:41.600
to be handled properly the way epstein wasn't and i would and this is my words now right to

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.800
maybe move away from the epstein thing one of the reasons that people think especially you think

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:54.160
america bad is because of the horrendous way that america handled foreign policy with the afghan

01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:02.720
and iraq war especially the iraq war right um and the just uh abysmal failures um from the

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:09.760
foreign policy community um and how we have handled all these things so to his question

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.160
how do we restore faith in the integrity of it because just because america is wrong sometimes

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.240
doesn't mean america is wrong all the time but that seems to be the lesson that a lot of people

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:24.960
took from the last 20 years is that america is just that right so i i can speak to this from

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.520
the the point of view of like more right-wing people that i know right because they all believe

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:36.800
that 2020 was a stolen election i did on the night of 2020 and i don't now and i went through

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:42.960
a process of figuring out why it wasn't so i'm sure you've both seen that that that video that's

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.360
been shared around millions of times where the polling station closes up and then one of the

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.760
workers you know pulls back the tablecloth and brings out a case of new ballots right

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:56.320
then wheels it over and starts counting the narrative on the night of the election was

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.880
that that was a case full of fraudulent ballots right and it needed to be investigated and it

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.040
needed to be it needed to be answered for like why is this woman pulling these ballots out

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.640
um and that's what everyone was saying including me on the night of the election

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:14.640
um it turned out that as the as the court cases and went through and the audits went through and

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.880
all all these sorts of things to see if the election was actually real or not it turns out

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.720
that um if you actually go back and like read some of the buried articles about that specific case

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.520
the judge said okay i sat down and i watched all the security camera footage and that was

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.240
actually a case full of legitimate ballots that was brought in earlier and the reason that it was

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:40.480
brought in is because republicans in that state had changed the laws such that mail-in ballots

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:45.600
could not be counted until after all the other ballots were counted so they were just being

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.320
stored under the table until it was time to count them so it was actually one of those things where

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:54.480
republicans changed the law and then it created a video that they got that they then had a

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.600
conspiracy theory about right but all of my right-leaning friends didn't keep up with any

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.400
of these investigations or any of these trials or any of these audits they they had you know

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:10.640
that the 15 that the 15 minutes news cycle on twitter and then moved on to the next thing right

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:16.240
and so after a month or two of investigations no one's talking about it anymore so

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:20.400
pretty much like i i kept i kept my finger on the pulse of all these stories because i wanted

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:25.280
to know but like nobody else that i know on the right did and now here we are three years on and

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:30.160
people are still bringing up that exact same video clip as if it's as if it's it's proof of something

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:36.720
and it's not so i i think it's it's social media it's a shortened attention span and it's people

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.880
being in echo chambers and and that is causing people to spin up completely different theories

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:48.880
about about how things are actually functioning and because they never actually return back to

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:53.600
rethink those ideas through they just kind of sit in their brains for for a few years that becomes

01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:02.480
what actually happened we see it playing out live like we see this video i saw of a helicopter an

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:09.840
apache helicopter blowing away hamas terrace it was originally shared saying that it was israel

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:17.120
just indiscriminately firing into the crowd at the uh the rave killing both innocent civilians

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:23.360
and hamas terrace and see look the idf calls most of these deaths um it was obviously shown to be

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
no they were attacking an entirely different place these were just hamas terrace that were trying to

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.400
run back into gaza after they had done their thing uh but it was too late it had gotten millions of

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.920
views hundreds and thousands of likes and no one's going to go back to that right no one's

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:46.960
going to to check it again it's now it's now it's now a fact and they are going to run with it right

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.520
yeah after it goes viral people aren't going to come back you know a week later or a month later

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.480
after the investigation is done they're just going to remember it as it was i think that's why like

01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:01.920
you know look i i hear what you're saying about this being a problem it's certainly correct my

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:07.840
mind always always always goes what is the public policy solution how can we how can we start to do

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:12.480
this i think like something i'm trying to do as a public figure and someone that works in this

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:17.200
field and trying to talk more with people on the other side and trying to have civil conversations

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:23.280
i think it's really important for those of us to model this i think that but i think the real

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:29.600
problem that's really difficult to solve is it really comes down to the algorithm right we have

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:35.600
a fundamentally different information space now that rewards sensationalism it rewards conflict

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:43.120
it rewards hyperbole and it it's how do you square that with the fact i think all of us here

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:48.720
agree with free speech we agree with open expression we don't want anyone censoring those

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:55.280
hot takes but we've got to come up with the way that the american people are being better served

01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.160
by the information that we're getting and let's be really clear this is not just an american

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:06.240
problem democracy is weakening all around the world and yet this being the way we consume

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:14.160
information is part of why it's it's destabilizing our country so i think this is i think it's really

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:20.560
really important and i i don't think that say facebook should have the amount of power it does

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:27.040
over the news uh that they do um maybe the answer is break them up i i truly don't know

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:34.080
but i i think something's got to change i don't know about uh policy uh like policies that can

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.600
be adopted to uh to improve this i'm not sure about that i do know that i have very little

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:46.000
influence over policy but i can control what i do right and so i can at least do better personally

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.960
and that's at least a little bit like you know if you are part of the world and you are if you

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:56.240
do better you've made the world slightly better so if all i can do is look at it from an individualist

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:02.880
perspective then that's what i do fair enough fair enough okay i'm going to ask the question

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:11.040
that my audience i know i know i know but it's it's it's here it's the elephant in the room and again

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:17.440
um well we gotta talk about it gamergate i've thought about the best way to do this

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:23.040
conversation for a little bit well then why not take it take it away dev man go ahead okay um

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.520
you don't have to get too in detail i guess but what was gamergate about from your

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:33.360
side from your perspective because you were anti-gamergate i was pro-gamergate so

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.600
since you're on opposite sides of the conversation i mean having seen me talk about this a million

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:47.200
times in media i mean so gamergate was about a organized harassment campaign against women in

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.840
the game industry i know y'all don't want to believe it was a real thing it was it hurt a lot

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:58.720
of people's lives and her reputations many of my friends quit the game industry uh permanently and

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:04.880
it was uh in my view the start of this playbook that when someone's saying or doing something you

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:10.640
don't like uh investigate them go through everything they've ever said find something

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.640
to smear them with and uh just try to destroy them by the with the mob um well speaking of

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.640
destroying with the mob sunday thanks for watching i see you making tweets about me

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:23.520
yeah you know i hope you like the channel as well but continue

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:32.560
so that's basically it what about you dev from your perspective so

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.880
um the pro-gamergate side is that it wasn't about harassment and it was actually about

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.720
there was ethical problems in in the gaming industry at the time

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.480
and i was definitely on board for the ethical problems i breanna i think you saw my my video

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.000
about phil fish and the investigation that i did like 10 years ago into the actual ethical

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.240
problems that that he was a part of because he did do some underhanded stuff um stardust at one

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.160
point when she when she was going to talk to you actually like was it six months ago or a year ago

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:11.120
or something yeah she she asked me about gamergate because she knew that i was involved in it and i

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.920
gave her my playlist of gamergate videos and she went she went through a few of them just to get

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.120
get a feeling of what it was like on the pro-gamergate side back then and i watched

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.880
a bit of her reacting to my old videos i hadn't seen my videos in 10 years and in the second video

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.840
i specifically say at the very start okay before we get in today's into today's content

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.160
i see that some of you guys are are actually harassing people and you guys need not to do

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:42.000
that you need to stop that shit so i was definitely even back then very cognizant about

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.320
the fact that there were some people who were taking it too far and also there were some people

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:51.920
who were simply hitching themselves to the situation to try and boost their own career

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:58.720
right people don't know this nowadays but milo came out of gamergate right yep um uh mike

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:04.000
cernovich came out of gamergate milo yanopoulos to be clear yes okay fair enough yeah yeah they

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.520
both yeah i don't have any issue with that yeah i've been friends with hat for my god 10 years

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:14.800
now right like he's one of those people trained as a journalist genuinely interested in the

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:23.040
the ethical concerns of that i just i think if all of us on this show tonight agree that uh the

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:27.760
outcome of progressive policies right now isn't always talking about health care it's about a

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:33.600
bunch of unrelated like cultural things that we do that are are not ethical i think we can

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:40.640
be honest and that like gamergate did a lot of that as well what's your biggest regret dev

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:45.360
what's your biggest regret from the gamer gate years my biggest regret from the gamer gate years

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:49.760
is that when phil fish sent me a cease and desist i listened to it and i took my video down

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.840
because i shouldn't have i shouldn't have given in to that kind of uh intimidation

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.640
can you just remind me like i like i i haven't spoken to phil in like

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.240
10 years but can you remind me what your ethical issue was with him

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:13.680
basically he he uh his game fez was the only game to win an award at the igf for two separate years

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:19.360
sure and one of them was for the demo of fez and one of them was for the actual release of fez

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:23.360
and the igf kind of hand waved up by saying oh it's a demo so it's not the same game

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.760
but it's the only game they give that treatment to that treatment too and then when phil fish's

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:34.320
company got hacked it came out that there were a bunch of people who were judges at the igf who

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:39.760
had invested in his company and they served and they they they were in a position to to

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:45.840
personally profit from the fact that the ig that that fez won so many awards and and was the only

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:51.280
game to win awards in two separate years it was like 2007 2012 or something like that yeah that's

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:59.280
pretty bad uh in to play i'm not defending that fez is a really good game though yeah yeah yeah

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:04.720
but i hear i hear you that's not defensible obviously they should uh ever use themselves

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.800
i just think you know directionally if you look at the state of the game industry today

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:15.120
i mean uh let's just be blunt uh ign is weaker than it's ever been kotaku hasn't been a force in

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.120
in the game industry in a while and you know when it comes to game coverage i think you know

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:26.960
skill up do a really good job uh but i think there's a whole host of youtubers that do

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:32.960
a much much worse job and they are directly being paid by these companies to come cover their

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:39.520
product right so i think if you look at i i just haven't seen that same level of anger at the

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.800
current state of the game industry which i think is way more rife with problems than it was a decade

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.800
ago i mean i'm i'm still like i'm still a pretty small channel in terms of the big leagues right

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.360
i know that like 150 000 subs is like kind of big but it's also kind of small to be honest

01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:01.280
i don't have millions i don't have that much much reach um no i still talk 150 000 okay you know

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:08.720
what i mean like like there's guys out there with millions of subs yeah yeah so much i'm i'm okay

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.480
what i mean to say is like i can only do so much but i do talk about like shitty youtubers as well

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:20.400
sure on my channel yeah i i do my part channel mostly you shut a lot of progressives on tik tok

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.880
you have a like most of your videos are tik tok tuesday nowadays which is a shame because i like

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:31.200
your last foreign content so much more that is it's only because i'm lazy and and your situation

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.040
with them causing so much noise at your house so fair yeah there's been there's been some

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:40.720
construction and also i've been quite lazy do you think um i guess i'll ask this right

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:51.680
for the many years you've been covering culture around games games etc um dev what is what is

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:58.720
have we improved overall or as rihanna wu has asserted have we have we just gotten worse i know

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.400
for me right when i was growing up and i wanted to know if a game was good there was some magazines

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:08.640
i would read or pick up or Nintendo power yeah things like that i would look through them and

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.920
i would get the strategy there no ethical issues yeah i would get the strategy guides and things

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.960
like that and i would pour through them i would go to blockbuster and look at the cool games that

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:24.240
were up for rent and i'd do that nowadays if i want to get a game right uh or if i want to see

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:31.600
if a game is worth getting uh i will go and look at either a youtube playthrough through it and see

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:39.120
some reviews or a let's play i will go to the steam user reviews and kind of click through a

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:45.520
few of them positive negative um so that as a normie someone who isn't like a super gamer

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.320
that's how i usually engage with the gaming industry today versus back then so i guess from

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.480
someone who covers that kind of thing and someone who i would consider much more of a gamer and a

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:59.280
nerd than i am um dev what better worse what do you think

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:10.320
hmm i don't think it's better or worse i think it's very different things have definitely

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:16.240
changed but i think we're probably about the same level as we were well then let's go to individual

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.680
let's go away from the the overall then so what into an individual instance is what do we do

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:29.040
better and what do we do worse okay um well gaming press like you said breanna gaming press

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:35.520
is definitely weakened right like all these sites are shutting down and and the the institution the

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.320
the career of journalists doesn't have the prestige that it used to have so that's probably worse

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:45.040
right and now you can argue whether or not that's because they were bad at their jobs or whether it

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:48.880
was because we don't respect them anymore it's probably a mix of both because there's been some

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.640
really bad journalism as well um the issue with youtubers and this goes beyond what you're what

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.680
you're mentioning wick but it does also involve this um is that youtubers don't take themselves

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.760
seriously enough i think and streamers don't take themselves seriously enough this is not related

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:10.240
to gaming but have you met streamers like i what we take ourselves way too seriously but go on

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:15.840
i meant in terms of like professional ethics oh fair enough that's true but we take ourselves

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:21.440
super seriously go on drama yes but like okay okay this is not related to gaming but it

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.480
definitely you can use this logic on a whole bunch of gaming youtubers right do you remember recently

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:32.560
um hasan i think he went on it was on national tv or it was somewhere and he said i'm just a

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.360
streamer man i have no control over anything i can't i can't control what my audience does

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.040
i can't i can't set any sort of narrative and it's like hold on if you're the biggest leftist

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:46.480
streamer in the world you should have some ability to set the narrative are we talking

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:52.800
about hamas piker okay gary yes that's what we're talking about but like that's not gaming but the

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.680
point still stands is that like if you have a platform and it's a reasonably big platform like

01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.640
we're talking like millions of subs or you know tens of thousands of viewers on twitch or something

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:09.680
you do have the ability to to set to set um to set conversations basically yeah and i and i think

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:18.000
that streamers they when it comes time for them to let's say be ethical in how they behave they

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.760
say i'm just a guy in my living room in my bedroom i don't know what's going on i can't affect

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:28.000
anything but when it comes time for them to take massive bags of cash from ubisoft or whoever they

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.320
take the massive bag of cash you know what i mean i do know what you mean um let me ask you directly

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:38.560
then um okay how do you fill your audience in this how do you abdicate your responsibility

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.480
have you or are you above the fray

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:48.400
well i don't take massive bags of cash there's that's one thing like i i've made i've made a

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.760
deal with myself that if i'm ever going to do out like a product sponsorship for example

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.880
it has to be something that i actually like and use myself i won't i won't like i know i don't

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:02.080
use vpns um until i start using one i'm not going to take a deal for a vpn for my channel right

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.000
it's one of those it's one of those types of things that's kind of how i view it is like

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.280
i i want even if you disagree with me i want people to trust in the fact that i'm saying what

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:19.600
i actually think even if you don't like it yeah yeah i feel the same way i take a i take a lot of

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.760
pride in the you know my professional integrity i mean i really try very hard to tell the truth

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.120
i try to answer questions even when they're unpleasant when they're asked of me and i try

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:37.920
to engage issues honestly and yeah sometimes that comes from critiquing my own side um you know and

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:43.360
it's it's hard i mean i feel like all the incentives now this is something i see over

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.240
and over again in the streaming space like wick my assessment is there are a lot of really

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:54.320
fundamentally dishonest people in this space it's really hard trying to figure out who to talk to

01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:01.360
who to interact with who not to what have you uh like so i know we've talked off screen right

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.400
about different people and things like that but i i just want to get a well i have two questions

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.160
for you one to go back to the same question i asked dev and speaking of asking hard questions

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:19.760
um i know you talked about um how one of your regrets is keeping it online and not taking it

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.400
offline and do things but other than that regarding your behavior towards others right

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.680
yeah do you have any regrets oh my god can you absolutely maybe talk about that a little bit

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:36.480
and then i i did i my second question to keep in mind would be um that since we live in as dev set

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.120
a space where there are people with a lot of influence who's abdicated for it how do you how

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:47.120
do you sift the wheaten from the chaff who do you decide how to why did you pick me to to work with

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:53.760
instead of sunday for example like like how do you how do you filter i guess go on well you're

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.320
not a congenital liar well true but no you know what i mean i'm being hyperbolic but you know what

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.200
i'm saying how do you sift the wheat from the chat so i feel like i've answered the same question a

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:09.600
million times i'll do it again um you know i know gamergate wants to pretend like what they did

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.280
didn't traumatize me but it did i had a clinical ace of trauma alive women in the game industry

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:21.840
also had clinical aces of trauma um it fucking broke me uh the stuff that went on um

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:32.720
so i can look back at my behavior and see how reactive and angry i was and i was not

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:39.920
always responding to things in a way that was productive right so i think if i did it over

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:45.680
again you know i would have unplugged from twitter a lot sooner um i think i would have

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.080
held on a lot of media appearances until i could react without so much anger in the moment um

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:59.680
so i just you know i feel like i squandered this opportunity to really advocate for better policy

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:05.760
for women in the the game industry and just on a personal note you know i cause so much pain

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:13.360
like one of the things is when you're traumatized you you you hurt the people around you um you know

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:21.600
i hurt my friends um i hurt uh you know i love frank dearly but i think he saw me at uh the

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:30.000
worst in some ways during gamergate right um so just just in the the midst of trauma i acted with

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:38.160
a lot of pain into things i'm not proud of right i do want to point out real quick sure um my

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:43.440
my involvement with gamergate was only on the ethics side of it and i certainly wasn't

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:47.200
responsible for any of that i'm sorry that it happened to you though i appreciate that thank

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:54.080
you can we can consider the hatchet berry of enemies uh of all they become i consider you a

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:59.840
friend i mean i well maybe not a friend i think we have a respect for each other we have a respect

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:05.360
for each other right like i like you i like your content i don't agree i preferred friend but okay

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:09.760
let's see if you want to be my friend i'll be your friend what's up dev what's what's your favorite

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.920
part what's your favorite thing about brianna woo today what's your favorite what's brianna

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:17.520
woo's best quality what do you like about her most friend of brianna

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:30.640
irrespective of of how victimized you were 10 years ago you definitely had some crazy takes

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:37.280
yeah back then and you do not seem like that crazy person now and that's actually that's

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:44.960
actually quite heartening because so many people just get worse over time well i i'm sure that

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.680
that probably sounded like a backhanded combat i didn't mean it to you but i i get it i think

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:55.520
that running for office did teach me a hell of a lot about how to advocate for things that i

01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:02.880
believed in right um so i think that was part of it was a real growing up experience so um thanks

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.560
i guess i i would hope that you would see me as somebody with integrity

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:13.040
you know do you make friends a lot dad do you have a lot of friends like uh just curious

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:24.240
kind of okay i have you you recognize that it was just a like sort of a shit answer but go on

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:33.280
no it's it's there's a lot of people that that i think can't stand me and sometimes i wonder why

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.840
and it's like well like is it my personality that's a problem is it like but then i realize

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:44.480
usually it's because like i'm i'm pretty honest and that can drive a lot of people away and it

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:49.920
doesn't mean that i'm like a perfect truth teller i just i i do i i don't i talk the same way online

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.800
is off i talk the same way public as in private you know i found that just like keeping secrets

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.280
and kind of like being a backroom schemer it it makes you a worse person in the long run

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.320
so i don't do that and that rubs some people the wrong way but five dollars from cryborn to say i

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.040
like brianna's pragmatism and recent work with bringing together left-wing streamers thank you

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:13.360
for the five dollars and thank you for a good example of a good answer to that question um

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.200
i guess uh

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:20.880
well same thing uh i think you already said about his videos but

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:28.000
you consider him a friend what about him that you like right personally i i think you have

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:34.000
really insightful criticisms of the right and the left um i don't i don't think you're as much of a

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:40.080
centrist from my point of views i think you you you tell yourself that you are but i think you

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:47.120
are i'm sorry am i a right winger from your point of view i don't know if right winger i think you

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:55.680
have a kind of instinctual distrust of anything um i think that when someone comes to you and

01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:01.200
tells you they don't feel like they're getting a fair shake in society i think you have a kind of

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:09.120
instinctual uh tendency to dismiss that um that and i don't think you're coming to that like

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:15.200
inauthentically or i don't think it's egregious right uh i i just i don't think it's the right

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:21.200
answer right uh but what i appreciate about you is i think in the the course of your i think you

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.560
produce some extremely thoughtful videos i think you're actually a really friendly person and

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.360
honestly i really this is silly thing but the way you talk about your um is it your girlfriend or

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:37.440
your wife naomi uh it's really apparent how much you care for her and uh i i think that uh i don't

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.960
know it just makes my heart grow three sizes every time i hear that i'm actually told that

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:48.560
a lot that like i relate whenever our relationship bleeds into online people really like it yeah

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:55.840
yes how did y'all meet if i can ask um we both worked the same awful part-time job back when i

01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:01.680
was in school yeah and we just kind of stayed together even after i left you know no five

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:05.840
dollars from artemis fowl dev is my favorite white nationalist communist

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:15.120
thank you oh my god so yeah like there was that there was that one short of demon mama

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.840
demon almost called me a fascist so many times at this point but there was that one where like

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:28.080
it was demon mama was lambasting you for talking to me brianna meanwhile i can go to some very far

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:34.960
right youtube channels where i'm being discussed and i'm like this leftist subversive communist

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:40.400
cuck who's trying to get into right-wing spaces to like convert people so one of the big reasons

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:46.320
why i do think that i'm a centrist is because so many people say the same things about me on two

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.320
extreme sides but they're inverted and it's like okay there's something here i think there's something

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:57.200
i deal with that too dev that doesn't make me a centrist i'm not you know like the exact same

01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:01.040
thing happens to have the left screaming at me i've certainly had the right screaming at me

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:09.200
i mean how is it's it's the same thing right maybe the difference um i have a i have a saying

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:13.360
i've been this is i think this is gonna become my like my dev saying this would be my branding

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:18.240
it's this idea that um governments should be liberal and people should be conservative

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.600
that's kind of how i i lay out my approach to politics because can you elaborate on that

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:33.840
sure sure so um when it comes to government policy like big big ticket things what what federal level

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:40.160
governments should do in america or in canada or in other other similarly sized states i tend

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:45.280
to agree more with liberals than with conservatives not consistently you know i'm definitely more pro

01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.000
gun than the average canadian for sure but i mean my stance on health care i think americans would

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.120
consider americans who aren't terminally online would consider to be far left right something

01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:02.480
like that however when it comes to how i think you should organize your life on a personal level on

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.480
like a local level i'm much more conservative because i think those things are generally just

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.560
better for people right you know like having having you know uh a good family life for example

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:16.560
that's that's more of a that's more of a conservative thing than let's say a progressive

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:22.240
thing but it's very important for people right having like more traditional family roles people

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:28.080
tend to be happier on average when they engage with those with with those types of of lifestyles

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.960
it doesn't mean you should be forced into it there's lots of conservatives that think you

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.640
should be forced into it i don't think that at all right if you're if you're you know cut from

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.760
a different cloth then go ahead and do your thing right here's a good example okay so i think i was

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:46.320
talking to dylan burns a few months back um and i want like i was outlying to him you know the

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:50.480
conservative case for gay marriage right and basically the the argument that i was playing

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:57.120
to him is let's say that you're a young gay man and you have two life paths ahead of you right

01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.080
and down one life path is you could get into like a monogamous relationship and adopt some kids and

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:09.520
raise them right get a decent job and contribute to your community be a be a productive person

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.280
you know and but these are all very conservative things even though it's a gay person doing them

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:19.520
or you could you know go go to the gay bar and be very promiscuous maybe catch a few diseases

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.400
you know debase yourself debase other people make people not proud of you you know what what would

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.520
be you're allowed to to to engage in hedonism because that's what a free society is but

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.920
what should you do you know what would be better for you what we what would be better for

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:40.400
the people around you if we what what character should you have as a person right and it seems

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:46.560
like more often than not organizing your life in a conservative way not necessary not necessarily

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:52.240
a religious way but a conservative way does seem to make people happier and healthier so

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.360
on the local level i'm pretty conservative on the national level i'm pretty liberal

01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:01.920
you know i've been married for 15 years i'm a pretty you know i've got a house i've got a

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:09.520
job you know like i i certainly agree with that i think where i i would really ask you and i don't

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:14.480
mean this disrespectfully but my my critique of you would be the exact same as tim pool in

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:22.320
the sense that there's such a a disproportionate amount of of um criticism that i think happens

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:28.560
on your channel right um and and i agree with that like i certainly have had plenty of criticism for

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.720
the fringe left lately but it's also true my day job is 100 about beating the republicans at the

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:41.600
ballot box right that's what i'm paid you know to do so i mean how can you see yourself in the

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:49.360
middle when so much of your content is about going after the left the main reason i do that

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:57.600
is because it's very criticism of the rights very simple right we all kind of intuitively get it's

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:03.520
like you know should you oppress gay people no obviously right like should you be racist

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:08.400
no it doesn't it doesn't take much brain power to explain why you shouldn't be a racist or why

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:13.040
you shouldn't be a homophobe you can easily lay these arguments out criticism of the leftist

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.960
complex it takes a lot more thought um you have to understand a lot more about i think about

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:25.680
certain things because i i think it's not that it's not that leftist ideas are necessarily more

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.960
complicated it's that they're more ubiquitous you know what i mean it's like it's here it's like

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.680
you know what is your your stereotype of a conservative it's like a you know like a you

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:40.400
know a redneck living in a flyover state who's kind of an educated he might be a bigot right

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:46.160
he's kind of an easy enemy to attack in a sense like what is your average left-leaning person

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:52.960
well he generally higher IQ generally makes more money lives in a more affluent area he seems to

01:51:52.960 --> 01:52:02.960
have more markers of success going his way it is in terms of philosophy leftism i think is in a

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:10.320
stronger position than rightism and so it requires more in-depth critiques i think i i hear with i

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.120
hear what you're saying and i agree with you the problem with leftism is a more interesting

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:22.240
conversation i i think the reason i think a problem i see consistently on your channels i

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:28.240
think you really underestimate the cultural power of the right i just went to south carolina

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:33.840
to debate john doyle i talked to a lot of students on campus i talked to a lot of people down there

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:39.680
in the south it was really conservative and i think that uh your vantage point of living in

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:45.200
canada and having your perceptions of the country primarily filtered through media i think if you

01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:51.520
had worked in election cycle in ohio or new hampshire i think that that would really change

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:58.080
your perception very very quickly yes it also might be the case that um canada does not have

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:03.680
the same kind of right wing that america does yeah well i think that's that's just also a you

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.800
big like just a true statement right yes obviously canada the right wing and america right wing i

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:14.400
think are not in the same place and now you can point to some um overlap i know that canada

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:20.080
canadians often complain about how american politics kind of seeps over the border a little

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:26.320
bit uh and influences their uh electorate and things like that i i yeah it's just different

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:32.880
problems different things if i may read a couple super chats um and then i will kind of wrap this

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.520

looking forward to that he is so smart and so thoughtful i really appreciate him well he's

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:08.320
he's very left-leaning right but i think he sees a lot of the same well what's the title of his

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:14.960
latest piece give me uh let me get get it up a second it's basically uh yes it's possible to

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:22.560
imagine progressive dystopias so he has seen a lot and been very critical of the left the far left's

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:28.000
response some among the far left's response to the october seventh thing and so he has really

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.160
come out and stood against that so it should be a fun and interesting discussion he's also so pro

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:40.880
national security very very smart on national security i'm not in this war hawk like you know

let's bomb our way to utopia kind of way like really thoughtful about uh you know what our

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:53.920
investment in the military gets us the good sides the downsides our need to you know think about uh

01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.120
when we're talking america withdrawing from the world uh what happens when china and russia uh

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.240
go into the power vacuum just just a really thoughtful person so i'm really looking forward

01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:10.000
to this i'm very very curious uh ten dollars from artemis fowl can anyone tell me why lefties are

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.360
up in arms about giving palestinians a state slash one state but don't say anything about

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:22.080
kurtistan or tibet seems like progs are simply hypocritical i for one remember when free tibet

01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:30.080
was the left's reason to tear right like they were very big on free tibet um i i don't know

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:37.600
uh to answer your question i'm not sure uh what do you think what do i think about that uh

01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:44.480
uh no i really agree with that i think that there's something

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:52.160
i i don't want to accuse people of like it only being about anti-semitism but it's hard to not

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:57.360
notice that some people are being held to a different rule set uh when it comes to this so

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:04.160
maybe a more charitable answer would be that looking at the uh you know oppressor oppressed

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:09.840
dynamics and having that be your pathway to coming with every single answer is not always

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:17.360
a very good way to do it probably so welcome back i'm back i'm back yeah i know honestly

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:23.360
i think when it comes to tibet it's honestly because 20 years ago china was not nearly as

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:27.680
powerful as it is now that's simply that's just it and you think because they are now

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:32.880
a major power that the left has stopped uh they're they're a major power and there's

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:38.240
multiple avenues for them to morally browbeat people who are far left they can use the race

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:43.440
angle they can use the socialist angle it's very easy for them to say to say whatever it is to to

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:48.160
get them to stop talking about tibet because that was like a leftist cause 20 years ago yeah

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:56.160
absolutely free tibet was a big thing um i know that brianna had questions just a couple questions

01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:02.800
okay i want you to look over here do you see this corner my office that is an original parasite

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:11.200
poster from uh japan and that is the original final fantasy 8 poster from japan those cost me

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:19.040
an ungodly amount of money so i wanted to ask uh why are these both uh uh these this is the

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:23.200
soundtrack to your channel so i've always wanted to ask you is parasite eve like is that an

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:30.240
important game for you the same way it is for me um i don't know how important it is i don't

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:35.600
think it's on my top 10 but it's really it's on my top 20 for sure as far as the soundtrack it's

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:42.480
got to be in the top oh so so when i'm choosing soundtracks i'm i'm looking for something that

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:48.320
fits a specific not it's not droning droning is not the right word but it's kind of like droning

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:55.200
where it's almost like investigative all right so i use yeah that's why i use the timber soundtrack

01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:01.040
well that was uninvestigated that was goofy yeah right okay but but like parasite even a lot of

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:06.640
parasite eve tracks um the police station for sure and also the central park track yes those

02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:11.840
are both they both feel like you're in an investigation so i use those for for investigative

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:17.920
videos oh i was hoping you were a huge fan that's so sad no i i am a huge fan but i'm not like

02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:24.320
they're like man it is in my top 20 so i guess i am like a pretty big fan but i'm not like the top

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:29.600
tier of fan if that makes sense okay fair enough my favorite game of all time is earthbound which

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:35.760
is a very lefty answer i love earthbound good game i have an original earthbound and i don't

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.720
even want to tell you how much i spent on that is it is it inbox with with the book no no i don't

02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:47.600
do that i i have games to play so um but uh yeah i love that thing oh my gosh i think you know

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:53.520
it like for all this talk about like making america great again i think that there's a

02:00:53.520 --> 02:01:00.000
political movement based on just bringing back the greatness to the video game industry of that ps1

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:06.560
square soft era of games which gave you vagrant story which gave you ein hander which is this

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:13.360
under valued amazing ps1 shooter with the most amazing soundtrack like all the final fantasies

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:19.200
final fantasy tactics all of these games make a movement to like bring that back to the game

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.800
industry and i don't even care if it's fascism i will be on board with that i miss that so much

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:30.560
yeah there were some good games and man their attempts to like redo it they're really hit and

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:34.480
miss like you go play like oh yeah traveler yeah like upper hill is pretty good but it's not the

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:40.480
same as like final fantasy 6 it lacks it kind of it's hard to put my finger on right it's

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:50.960
the certain if you will it just it feels too formulaic too clean too um too processed i guess

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:54.800
when you're playing octopax traveler it's the fact that you can play as all the characters

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:58.560
or none at any point in time so they can't have any meaningful interactions with each other

02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:04.720
so it's always like a lack of meaningful choice is what you're saying to me no not choice

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:09.760
interactions so if you play like like a final fantasy 6 or a final fantasy 7 the characters

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:13.360
are always going to have the same interactions at the same point in the story right yeah you

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.920
play it multiple times if you play octopath traveler because you can get you can recruit

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.560
the characters in any order you want all of their plot lines happen independently of each other

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.400
and they never had the characters never feel like they're actually on an adventure together

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:31.680
and that's a big problem um second big problem is that the writing is just needs to be edited down

02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.760
there's like three times too much dialogue in octopath and i think that's because like

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:41.360
if you're thinking back to like the ps1 or the snes you're uh like and you're thinking back to

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.800
when you were like nine years old or something because i was i was pretty young when those games

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:50.640
came out the it feels like in your memory there's way more dialogue than there actually is yeah if

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:54.720
you go back to like final fantasy 6 right now and just like emulate it and speed through it there's

02:02:54.720 --> 02:03:00.960
not much dialogue not really um but it felt like a lot as a kid so to get the same feel they just

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:06.480
bloat the dialogue up in a game like octopath traveling just way too much i don't i feel like

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:12.400
one of the things that made final fantasy 6 so good is they really thought about the amount of

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:17.040
grinding that you have to do one of the reasons 8 is so great is because grinding doesn't do

02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.240
anything for you in final fantasy 8 and you can actually like you can do a final fantasy 6 play

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:28.880
through in 10 hours if you know where you're going so i think i think these games are so bloated

02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:35.440
nowadays that they lose a lot of that magic in my view yeah i think a lot of the bloat really

02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:40.000
comes from the fact that when you were a kid you know 60 hours seemed like a lot more than

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.520
it does when you're an adult yeah and also you know that was your one game for like six months

02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:51.600
or something if you get anymore yeah um i like all the same games that you do well you mentioned

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.200
earlier in this conversation right like the it's the um too much access i think that maybe

02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:03.680
too with games is the same thing yeah too much it's also um fifty dollars just real quick fifty

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:08.960
dollars for mark swain's revenge uh do you guys think that fundamentalist islam which compels

02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:15.280
men to emulate the prophet muhammad is inherently dangerous for all non-fundamentalist islamists

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:25.760
it's a spicy one that's pretty spicy anyone want to take a crack at it well so i mean the answer

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.840
is going to be yes on some level and you can make the same argument for other religions like every

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:35.760
religion has its fanatical version that is dangerous to other people um i think islam might

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:42.720
be unique because it carries within it a doctrine of how to set up a religious state and most

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:48.640
religions don't have that in their in their doctrine so it might be uniquely dangerous

02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:50.960
that doesn't mean obviously that all muslims are dangerous or anything like that

02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:57.280
i think that if you got out into the world and the democratic party you would see that at least

02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:02.480
here in this country a lot of the muslim americans that are here are some of the most progressive

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:08.000
thoughtful smart kind loving people that you will ever meet in your whole life um you know like jink

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:14.880
is not um he's not muslim like extremist when it comes down to it so uh i'm not comfortable

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:20.480
i'm not comfortable with blanket statements like that i think that um a lot of muslim countries

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:26.720
are not democracies uh and i think that uh that obviously causes a lot of problems and repression

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:31.600
i mean it's the same it's it's the same that canada doesn't we have like a huge muslim population

02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:36.320
but we have a very big sikh population it's the same with them right like their their religion

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.520
is overall very peaceful and yet canada has recently had like the sikh terrorist issues

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.280
which probably didn't make it into the american news but like there's there's stuff happening

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:49.920
up here that well they uh they uh assassinated that's not all sikhs obviously uh i think

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:58.400
india uh struck them like killed one of the sikhs in canada i believe is yeah yeah so the tldr the

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:04.320
tldr that is that the sikhs want like an and they want an ethno state for the sikh religion in india

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:08.480
in an area called calistan they're trying to break it off the indian government obviously

02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:15.440
doesn't want that um there is a big i i think i think the violence hit its peak in 85 when they

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:24.400
blew up a flight going to canada all right well okay real real quick the tldr is that a bunch of

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:29.200
the calisthenian um extremists moved to canada they kind of blended in because canadians are

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:32.800
like they're very they're very nice and polite and open and welcoming from their country so of

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:37.360
course come here of course not knowing what was actually happening and so now there is this this

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:45.040
growing calisthenian issue in canada where canada might be harboring some legit terrorists and india

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:49.600
has now um assassinated one of them on canadian soil which has caused an international incident

02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:53.520
absolutely so that's something happening here that americans aren't americans aren't paying

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:59.360
attention to it it's happening right real quick five dollars is lizam right about women that is

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:08.640
a troll obviously not our artemis fowl i know him he donates a lot of money yes he trolls every

02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:14.560
single time i am okay with that uh but you had a question a last question and we have some colors

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:20.160
backstage gang if you want to get uh in line uh well they were backstage where they go uh

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:24.160
exclamation point discord and chat or click the link that i provide in the youtube chat

02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:28.800
uh accept the rules and then jump backstage and we'll pull you on one at a time to talk to these

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:35.440
wonderful individuals but go ahead last uh i'm good to go let's get to the colors oh no no it

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:41.440
was like a video game question maybe uh i it's covered it's cool i'm cool oh okay okay okay um

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:46.160
actually i i have a question for you then okay like you're very clearly a squaresoft fan yes

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:52.560
yeah okay um you like earthbound so you have to like rpgs probably like chrono trigger as well

02:07:52.560 --> 02:08:01.680
yeah it's really good it's really good yeah um how about like like western rpgs like vampire the

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:06.800
masquerade bloodlines that's considered a classic it's good i've never done a complete playthrough

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:13.040
of it i mean does mass effect count as a western rpg i think that's the greatest video game ever

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:19.760
made i mean which one uh well two is obviously the best but all three of them in order i mean

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:24.000
come on that's the greatest story our our industry has ever produced in my view

02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.840
i uh i keep everyone says two is the best i think one is better than two

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:36.000
this story is better but the gameplay is not i i like that old style of kind of

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:42.160
uncompromisingly janky gameplay well which class do you play because i do uh assassin

02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:48.160
and sniper rifle so maybe that's why we have a different perspective uh engineer so i've

02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:54.480
never done an engineer play through how does that work um well in the in the future games you get

02:08:54.480 --> 02:09:01.040
drones and you get turrets and those are those are really nice you can basically like there's

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:05.520
a way to play mass effect where it's basically the loneliest shepherd where you recruit as few

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:10.320
people as possible you kill off as many partners as possible and you go it alone for as much as

02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:15.200
the game and you play in engineers that all you have are like robot buddies it's a really fun

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:20.320
way to play the game but like it's everyone is dead and you can actually pretty much break the

02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:23.680
game by the end of the playthrough in mass effect 3 because the game doesn't know what to do because

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:29.120
everyone's gone so if you're on vermyer you're sending ashley and caden to go die basically

02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:38.160
um okay what one last question yes how about how about deadly premonition i i don't know this game

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:44.640
what are you talking about it is a horror game from the 360 yes i remember this this is the one

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:51.440
where paranoia affects your your sense of stuff right uh no okay i'm thinking something else no

02:09:52.240 --> 02:10:01.360
uh it's basically twin peaks the game oh my god and i i i definitely have like a hipster sense

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.400
of taste when it comes to uh to to games and tv and movies so i love twin peaks

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:10.240
i love that whole aesthetic and that that's that type of storytelling and deadly premonition is

02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:14.080
twin peaks the game it recently got a switch re-release you can play it on modern consoles but

02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:21.520
it's it's like unfinished and kind of comedically it's comedically unfinished but the charm of the

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:27.520
game is just it's over the top i love it it's it's on my list of top 10 it's twin peaks yeah

02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:31.440
i like it when your channel talks about games you had a really salient thoughtful

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:36.640
analysis of final fantasy 16 that uh i i didn't agree with all your conclusions but i thought

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:41.840
it was a really interesting thought uh like analysis of the plot and the the political

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:50.400
subtext of it so i wish you'd do more of that there's one coming tomorrow oh fancy okay so yeah

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:56.880
the tldr of it is basically um there's this idea that conservatives they they're media illiterate

02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:01.280
you know we're talking about this before before before we started the idea is like they they watch

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:06.560
the boys and they see homelander and then they like seal clap not recognizing that it's it's

02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:12.080
criticizing america and criticizing like american like exceptionalism right and there's probably a

02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:19.040
lot of truth to that at the same time though there's this view again mainly among breadtubers

02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:24.240
all right it's it's it is it is leftist crazies who are terminally online they believe that like

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:28.880
all media and all all entertainment media has messages that are exclusively for them and

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:34.720
if conservatives enjoy something that they're um they're coping or they're like intellectually

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:38.880
dishonest or they have some sort of dissonance in their heads and it's like no no there are

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:43.920
actually good conservative stories right legend of zelda i gave you the example legend of zelda

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:48.080
is a conservative story because in every single game link is restoring the monarchy all right

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:54.240
there is a there is a hard conservative subtext in legend of zelda for sure so i'm i'm i'm making

02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:59.760
the argument libtards coping and ceasing right now i i'm making the argument that there are

02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:06.560
definitely like anon is authoritarian though anon is authoritarian yeah of course he is yeah

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:11.520
yeah but i mean authoritarianism isn't isn't exclusively a rightist thing and monarchy is

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:16.400
certainly a monarchy is certainly exclusively a rightist thing every single time link puts

02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.440
princess zelda back on the throne that is reaffirming monarchy it's unclear how much

02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:27.760
political power zelda actually holds i am i am not prepared for this debate but fair enough let's do

02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:31.760
it um but let me read these first five dollars from tempered squeal for giving me lovely

background noise while i work love the conversation and five pounds from conus x

uh plus one day plus one day let's bring in the first caller

02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:12.080
hello a lot

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:21.680
hey guys how you doing um hi it's too friendly in here i i'm gonna try to get you guys to fight

02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:28.400
with each other a little bit uh no i'm just kidding uh i mean maybe um my question is mainly

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:34.720
brianna esta if you want to answer you can you guys like briefly touched on cancel culture earlier

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:41.600
i was just curious uh brianna if if you see any um because to me there's a there's a pretty

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:47.120
discernible party line between the type of emotion that the phrase cancel culture like evokes in

02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:52.480
people um you know like like people right-leaning conservatives tend to think of it as like the

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:59.200
villain the big bad bogey and then um left-leaning people generally see it as like a dog whistle for

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:05.200
basically anti-wokeness or anti-progressivism um as a figure of yourself do you see any um

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.840
can you identify any concerning aspects of cancel culture like what it's done to progressives

02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:17.200
oh um yeah first of all i think this is one of these things where no one is taking a long enough

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:22.160
historical view of this i'm old enough to remember what happened to people that spoke out against the

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:28.800
iraq war of which i was one of them right and there was a very real sense if you spoke out

02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:35.920
against president bush right after 9 11 that you would lose your job um you know there was um so

02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:42.640
i think the conservatives have been running you know cancel culture for a long time um yeah i

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:48.320
think i have a different assessment i don't um i do think i i actually want higher standards for

02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:54.960
people in how we express ourselves publicly but i think uh it's really obvious that this current

02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:01.920
playbook of trying to get everyone fired over the most minor statements and just making witch hunt

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:08.560
witch hunt witch hunt the uh way that we advocate for change it's it's not working uh i think a lot

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:14.560
of people think progressives are assholes uh now i think that we have less cultural power today than

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:22.240
we did 10 years ago and um i i think there is certainly an illiberal element to this you know

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:27.600
i think that no matter your views at the end of the day we're a democracy we need to settle our

02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:32.960
differences at the ballot box and i think there does need to be more tolerance for allowing people

02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:39.440
on the other side to have their say so um i realize that's a more nuanced uh view than just

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:48.160
cancel culture bad but this stuff is really like free speech is this there's a lot it really matters

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:53.600
how you approach that principle and how you safeguard it right just to give one super quick

02:16:53.600 --> 02:17:00.400
example when it comes to national security we all agree with free speech but like russia is

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:07.040
weaponizing our ideals against us and by using bot farms to exacerbate our divisions here in

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:12.160
this country make it seem like things are more inflamed than they are and now the new warfare

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:17.040
against the united states is it happens with trying to basically inflame these differences

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:22.640
between people what is the answer for that like we can't like start just censoring uh people

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:28.080
disagreeing with each other but we should certainly have a policy to like identify bot farms

02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:37.840
um so all this stuff is really complicated um okay do you do you care more about progressives

02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:44.640
looking like assholes or do you care more about um potential like sustained casualties from um

02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.360
people catching strays i guess from uh from as a result of cancel culture and what it's done to

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:56.160
progressivism i genuinely care about both um i think both are extremely high downsides

02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:00.000
like on a priority list i would say both of those are an a-level priority

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:06.720
okay so do you agree with your honor we were do you have a more um negative outlook on it

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:13.520
um you have to repeat a little bit sorry i spaced i'm just curious

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:21.920
uh so beyond has identified uh basically that uh cancel culture uh oh why don't you i don't want to

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:27.040
um brianne if you could give them a summation it started with dixie chicks basically or like

02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.720
not didn't start but like the right was doing it earlier and you had like dixie chicks that

02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.000
could get canceled i remember that from back in the day yeah yeah um but i do think freezing it

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.440
as conservatives have been running cancel culture for a long time is probably not the

02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:44.960
most accurate way of characterizing it i don't think this is the dark part of the human heart

02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:50.960
it's no one side has political power gamergate was about cancel culture in a large way against

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:57.520
feminists in the game industry i mean everyone's gonna like everyone's gonna say like i'm against

02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:03.120
cancel culture but here's my political opponent and here's some evidence that he might have raped

02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:08.560
someone so let's get him fired everyone's gonna feel like that's just in the moment right but it

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:14.400
probably isn't especially if the evidence is not good so ah it's it's tough it's one of those

02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:21.040
things where it's like do you do you really want to have complete free speech because then you do

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:28.720
get the russian bot farms that like you mentioned before but i don't know i will say there's there's

02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:34.640
this sorry go ahead no um i will say this about the whole thing uh we're going to see a lot of

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:39.280
people speaking out rightly so in my opinion i want to be clear this is good that they're

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:43.920
speaking out against it the people losing their jobs over pro-palestinian stances in the coming

02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:51.120
months right we're going to see that happen over and over again on the left and if we had not

02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:57.040
created the mechanisms to get people fired from their academic jobs for right-wing views right

02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:02.800
um we would not be seeing this today at least not at the numbers we are so this is the thing

02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:10.720
if we want to be able to say and speak out on controversial important issues we have to keep

02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:18.400
that shield strong when people we don't like in fact may hate come out and say things that we hate

02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:25.600
or oppose and i think that keeping that shield strong to protect us all is going to be what

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:32.640
gets us out of this mess and we just have to re-return to our roots as a nation and say

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:39.600
i may not respect what you say but i respect your right to say it and i think we need to really

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:44.880
cling to that again um sorry dev i didn't mean to cut you off but i i like free speech is my thing

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:49.920
okay this is what i that like like that that sounds really good but i think there's probably

02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:54.080
some logistical problems in there because for example if you like you later on this but go on

02:20:54.880 --> 02:21:00.000
let's say you have two political parties right and you know the political power is being handed

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:04.240
between them each election and one political party is completely fine with censoring their

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:08.560
opponents so they don't even give a shit the other political party says you know what no free speech

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:13.520
for everyone we're all everyone's gonna we're all gonna play by the same rules you end up you end up

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:19.520
in a position where every time the free speech party takes power their opponents get to run

02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:24.720
get to run wild with free speech every time they the free speech party is on the outs

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:29.680
they get censored and it becomes this one-way battle right so you almost have to have a standard

02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:36.240
of you're only going to censor the censors in a sense but i think that censorship right uh

02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:41.280
in a real way it's cutting off it's getting short-term games absolutely short-term gains

02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:46.640
can be gained from it absolutely but i in a very real way i think it undercuts and undermines your

02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:51.440
own position so while yes the one party who engages in censorship while the other doesn't

02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:56.240
uh short term it's going to have a lot of success when it gets power to be able to censor and cut

02:21:56.240 --> 02:22:01.200
off its enemies but i think at the end of the day like the good guys are good guys for a reason it's

02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:06.000
because they don't do the things the bad guys do right um and i know that's a simplistic way

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.400
of looking at it but i think most of my audience are simpletons so we're gonna keep with the

02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:18.320
analogy here this is where like respect i know we fight on this but go on you're obviously a

02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:22.400
really smart guy but let me give you a really concrete example of where i think it's just a

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:28.400
little bit more complicated than i i think you acknowledge so uh here's a really good example

02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:34.960
my good friend carrie gold book's amazing book on this talks about some of her fights to try to get

02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:40.960
big tech to do things that are correct when it wasn't in their uh profit interest right she

02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:47.360
runs a really great law firm um and one really concrete example of this is someone uh was on

02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:55.200
grinder and they had a jilted former boyfriend who sent made a habit day after day after day after

02:22:55.200 --> 02:23:03.120
day of sending random strangers to his house to have sex with him so he would be cooking dinner

02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:09.360
somebody would be knocking on the door trying to have sex with him right just did this constantly

02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:16.000
she tried everything possible to try to get um basically grinder to expand their own terms of

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:22.000
service and take action against this they just would not do anything about this you know under

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.320
hold on like the way you're talking about this like that's a free speech issue they're making

02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:32.000
their own account right so i think all of these things if you really dig into the policy of like

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:37.600
ways away 230 is implemented in this country i want to keep 230 but i think the critics have

02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:43.600
some real fair points that deserve a policy answer so i think the more you know about this subject

02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:49.360
the more complicated all of it actually gets but that's the thing the situation you described isn't

02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:54.800
sure speech because speech when i say free speech and absolute free speech i'm thinking the ability

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:59.840
to express ideas without censorship for that what you're describing is something that is different

02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:06.880
that i'm fine with um i i we we have no i have no compulsion or compunction with you um engaging in

02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:13.680
mechanisms that shut that kind of behavior down because it's a different style of thing now it's

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:20.560
like the heckler's veto right um it's cutting the mic instead of allowing people to speak and there's

02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:25.200
a such a difference there but i don't want to hog this conversation up porsche ran away because we

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:30.640
stopped talking to him uh it's color time right um but if you guys question real quick yeah but

02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.960
if you guys want to just real quick if i may if you guys want to read the best book i've ever read

02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:41.680
on free speech kindly inquisitors look it up check it out it's great i forget the author off the top

02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:47.520
of my head but kindly inquisitors you can google it and find out um it's a very very good uh

02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:52.480
treaties on why free speech matters and why it's important i wanted to ask this but i forgot i've

02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:56.720
remembered it was was that the ikea trans shark in the background as well

02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:05.920
oh yeah yeah yeah it's wahaj all right yeah yeah okay i figured i thought it was what i

02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:11.360
don't know so i just wanted to confirm yeah so i had blachage before blachage was a trans icon

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:17.920
believe it or not there was an article that came out i think it was back in 2017 about ikea

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:22.640
canceling this shark and a whole bunch of russians getting angry about it and i saw

02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:27.600
this story of it i was like oh my god that is the cutest thing i've ever seen i've got to get that

02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:34.880
shark and then like years later blachage became a huge trans icon so i was in way before the trend

02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:44.480
all right okay guys ready for the next caller let's do it speaking of trolling

02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.560
artemis foul welcome hi artemis what's up you're live how's it going

02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:57.840
artemis yes i understand i'm unmuting myself hey hey how's it going how come you're not

02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:04.080
involved in the project zomboid server with kibbs i have a a job that is very important

02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:08.400
that makes a lot of money do you think i have time to play in the middle of the day when everybody

02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:16.880
else is supposed to be at work well that that is our job sorry yeah so i do have a question for

02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:25.200
everybody here so the right back in the day in the 90s was pearl clutching about you know evil

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:32.080
satanists and stuff like this and doing the slippery slippery slope argument of they're

02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:36.240
going to destroy everything or it's the end times that the left gets what they want right

02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:43.200
now seeing how far the left has gone in terms of its policies and enacting them

02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:48.720
would we say more or less that the right was correct in that where it was heading or

02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:58.240
or is it not because for my example c.s lewis talks about the moral tyrant right that never

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:04.800
sleeps whereas the the republicans are evil in a lot of aspects but at least at some point they

02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:12.640
stop messing with you they have so go ahead i mean no we'll finish your question then we'll

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:20.000
respond i promise is is the it was is the right was the right correct about the slippery slope

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.920
of the left because from what everybody can see in the last 10 years the slippery slope is not

02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:32.240
no longer a fallacy but just a an inevitability at this point can i help you with it can i help you

02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:36.320
out with an example go ahead so i i think i don't think i agree with you but i think i know what

02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:41.920
you're getting at okay so there was definitely this idea back when it was uh being uh gay

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:47.440
marriage is being debated is that if if we if we allow gay marriage they're going to be having sex

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:51.520
with animals they're going to be having sex with children they're going to be doing all this weird

02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:55.120
shit and that was that was the right wing argument and everyone back then you know kind of rolled

02:27:55.120 --> 02:28:00.560
their eyes and said okay grandma like this is obviously stupid right and now you have a lot

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:07.360
of right wing accounts online that are promoting instances and they in my opinion they're isolated

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:12.240
instances but they are bad instances of let's say trans people doing weird things with children

02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:18.320
and i think even though that's that's i think it's a minority of instances it's enough and it's been

02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:23.600
amplified enough that right wingers are currently saying we were right the whole time is that what

02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:29.120
you're getting at basically well the right wingers will say that but i'm just saying is it can anybody

02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:34.480
see the argument there i can see the argument but i don't think i agree with it necessarily

02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:40.640
i think both sides have you know slid more and more and more into extremes and i think uh

02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:46.640
probably one of the failures uh is i've engaged this tonight i think we haven't acknowledged how

02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:53.600
crazy the republicans are now some absurdly high number of republicans nowadays don't even believe

02:28:53.600 --> 02:29:00.000
in democracy when when mitt romney that's not my opinion that's mitt romney's opinion when he

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:06.560
resigned from the from the senate right so um i'm not gonna tell you that the hyperbole of my own

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:14.480
side does not go to crazy town it does it absolutely does but i don't think that issue is

02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:20.640
limited to to one side i'm not gonna um i'm not gonna tell you who but it was a pretty famous

02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:26.080
person on the right and i was talking to this person the other day they were telling me how

02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:33.440
uh with their algorithm when they go on to instagram it's like recipe of how to make a bomb

02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:40.240
like recipe on how to like create your own like flammables for a riot right like it's this

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:46.800
constant deluge of stuff to literally bring out an insurrection right and just how stunning they

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:54.080
feel about how their own side is behaving so um like i think dev i know you have a really good

02:29:54.080 --> 02:30:00.000
video criticizing this word reactionary and i know i'm misusing it according to your definition here

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:05.920
but i do think that all of us are coming just so emotionally charged in the way we

02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:10.400
respond to each other it's it's it's leading some really crazy stuff

02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:21.360
what about you wick well i talk a lot about on my channel about reciprocal radicalization

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:27.120
and how both sides have driven as brianna said each other into more and more extremes because

02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:33.440
they have to fight the other side so when you talk about like um was the right correct that

02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:42.880
the left was going to go this direction um yes and no but it's it's a self-fulfilling prophecy

02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:48.880
because i'm very they are they have created this monster they are responsible for this monster in

02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:55.920
a lot of ways um and i don't think they can solely take blame obviously right i think the left has

02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:03.920
autonomy um but at the end of the day there is a party of sanity still and i i say it's squarely

02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:11.120
on and most issues the democrats um republicans they're again they're i i don't want to i don't

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:16.880
want to like i have a large republican audience right they are not crazy they're sane but their

02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:23.920
leadership and a lot of the policy positions that have been pushed by some of these people are out

02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:28.640
of the out of out of this this world now that isn't to say that the left doesn't also have

02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:34.160
crazy policies that they pass or push right like this idea that they're going to to remove

02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:41.360
standards for eighth graders on um you know uh math or Washington and things like that right it's

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:48.320
it's it's again for a very specific group of people sure yeah yeah but they are they are it's

02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:54.560
a it's a there it's a tit for tat right it's a tip for tat we have to go hard because if we don't

02:31:54.560 --> 02:32:02.560
go hard they're gonna go hard like mansion has decided not to run again because he's gotten so

02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:09.280
he again this man joe mansion i'm gonna stand him for a little bit right he got it a huge uh

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:15.440
win for energy for american energy past he also was again an important seat he voted progressive

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:23.200
what 90 of the time and but because he didn't vote for it a hundred percent he got crucified

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:30.480
and that's not going to make the next replacement be less radical right or uh it's not that's the

02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:34.640
argument against joe mansion i think i think the issue is is that most people in the left

02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:40.960
thinking it was a blue dog and a republican in a uh an all but name it's the corruption

02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:47.680
it's the outright corruption in the uh medical industry well i think that you know like

02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:53.760
ruling on issues of like uh basically the use of fossil fuels and sabotaging bills while he's

02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:57.760
actually owning one of those companies i think that's pretty outright corruption

02:32:57.760 --> 02:33:02.320
do you think that no but do you think oh brianna come on you you don't think that when the left

02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:07.840
criticizes mansion that's not what they're criticizing at least that's not what i see

02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:13.840
that's not there's certainly a portion of the left that does that but um you know we are a

02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:20.080
political party and when one person is sabotaging you know our president's efforts to get certain

02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:25.760
legislation passed i think he should expect blowback i mean mansion certainly gets this i

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:31.680
mean this is democracy functioning but mansions replace like we have cut okay no this is where

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:37.280
i agree with uh matt matty glacius right he talks about how mansions and the problem is that we need

02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:43.600
a lot more mansions the and hold on before progressive tour crucifies me the problem is the

02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:49.840
senate is like as a structure is fundamentally stacked against the democrats it always will be

02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:54.000
this is the reason we have a bicameral system in the first place in this country is because they

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:01.040
knew that uh you know they wanted to have uh continue slavery and they knew um that if you

02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:05.600
leave these issues up to just the popular will the people they're a lot of powerful interests

02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:10.800
are going to be crushed the senate is fundamentally stacked in favor of the republicans so if you have

02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:17.360
more moderate people out there that we're growing to be able to win some of these states that are

02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:24.160
more conservative leaning like west virginia that will over time give democrats more power and i

02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:29.520
agree with that hold on there's there's definitely better arguments for the existence of the senate

02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:35.520
as it currently stands in that though yes it serves a good function yeah the senate the senate

02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:43.280
is there to tamper uh tampin expectations on like situations of high intense fervor from passing

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:49.760
through the the lower house that the house and then that's the that's the whole point is just

02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:54.640
for change incrementally so that people don't go and say and start a war that destroys the

02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:59.040
nation that's the whole point of the senate and to provide some type of check and balances

02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:05.760
against large population centers look i i look i am an institutionalist at my core i don't have

02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:10.400
a big problem with the senate i'm talking about a strategy about how the democrats can get more

02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:15.760
power uh you know if mansion stepping down we don't have candidates on deck that are moderate

02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:22.240
that can win in west virginia so um i would love like don't get me wrong i'm a pro-abortion

02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:28.720
pro-feminist uh progressive but i think if we are interested in keeping the senate it makes sense to

02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:34.240
have candidates on deck on those states that we can run and win and get political power for

02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:39.200
ourselves so i got a question on the ohio thing oh one last question but we do have a uh do have a

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:45.120
line so yeah one last thing i'll get you so why do you think that the ohio abortion thing is a

02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:51.600
knock against uh republicans what do you mean because republicans are staunchly about letting

02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:57.280
states decide abortion rather than allowing the overall federal government to make a sweeping

02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:03.040
judgment on it uh i think that it is going to be terrible look this if you want to make this

02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.840
an abortion question it's going to take a whole hour so not about the abortion but about the

02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:12.000
allowing the states to the individual state to decide their own policies it's terrible for

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.640
women's public health this is a right men would never allow a law like this to be passed about

02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:22.800
their own bodies it is leading to terrible outcomes and like it's horrible top to bottom

02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:27.680
so i do not support that okay that's fair i was just going to say that that argument would have

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:34.240
had valid before 2020 and the covered lockdown but the but that that covered lockdown destroyed

02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:40.880
that argument because nobody cared about self self uh choice when it comes to medical procedures

02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:47.440
oh during that time so okay this might be it's true this might be its own thing no that's fine

02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:54.560
you know me yeah thank you for your statement on that that's it i i i just wanted to know but

02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:01.760
thank you okay um and val thank you for coming on and thank you for the super chats uh so here's the

02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:08.560
thing i can considering what i know about artemis's job i know that he's a glowy if you know what that

02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:15.360
means he's actually yeah he actually is a glowy yeah okay that that would actually be an interesting

02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:19.440
conversation you and him because you probably both know way more about the american government

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:26.640
than i do sure so because he actually does work in in it to some i i can't talk about how but he

02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:32.240
does he has are you doxing are you doxing this guy is this no no i am not okay i just don't

02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:38.400
want you to like oh i know that guy here's his address and name and he he has overthrown several

02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:44.720
south american dictatorships i'm not anti-law enforcement kind of gal i mean you know i've

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:49.440
worked with the fbi multiple occasions of multiple projects at this point you know when

02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:55.280
my congressional campaign was hacked by russia they stepped in and was really impressed by the

02:37:55.280 --> 02:38:01.280
skill of their cyber security team i think it's really important for national security right so

02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:09.120
um was actually hacked by russia yeah how do you know that because i can't get into it but i do

02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:16.000
know this okay there are new stories about it go read them okay fair enough okay yeah uh next caller

02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:19.280
soy addle hello

02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:29.360
soy addle soy addle oh there he goes uh oh he's gone don't click the join voice button

02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:35.680
don't click it i'm sorry discord silly um unmute yourself and go go ahead yeah

02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:45.920
so dev when did gamergate actually start was it like pax 2014 was it uh a week before

02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:50.240
when adam baldwin tweeted about gamergate or was it long before then

02:38:53.440 --> 02:39:00.240
what why are you a shark i figured i'd telegraph my position as and trigger you a little bit

02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:05.200
oh jeez when did like when did it start i don't fucking know dude was it when adam baldwin tweeted

02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:10.000
gamergate was that like because that was like it didn't have a name was it wasn't a nameless

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.800
movement before then or it was like it was it was the same movement but it probably it was

02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:19.040
nothing less before then yeah but it was a movement yeah so so we we've got a narrative

02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:24.240
that that's coming from the author of the gamer gate book that uh you had to be a time traveler

02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:30.320
that you had to be a time traveler to do everything that has been attributed to gamergate

02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:36.880
and this kind of debunks that so if it was a movement before adam baldwin then that narrative

02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:42.480
doesn't play out and i want to make sure that we're honest about that yeah so all right what

02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:51.120
was what was sort of this the the the the incentive the uh sorry the the spark that set off

02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:56.320
yeah it was the most it was the zoe post right okay so no well but then you're saying i don't

02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:01.200
agree with that by the way i think it was adam baldwin and and all that that's when we got the

02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:08.000
name in in my view i think uh zoe is incorrectly uh credited as the catalyst for game again i

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.200
actually think it started with amita sarkeesian before then and a feminist frequency gang founded

02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:20.080
because right after that what is not historically recognized is how that playbook immediately

02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:25.840
started bleeding over into the personal lives of women in the game industry they've been talking

02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:31.600
about equality so um yeah i think that's when it started i i can only tell you what i remember

02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:37.520
i remember you know you know hanging out in 4chan and anita was making videos and everyone was

02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:40.880
shitting on her and saying these are bad videos she doesn't know what she's talking about she's

02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:49.680
not a real gamer all that was happening but i don't remember any sort of like consistent united

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:56.320
until the zoe post dropped and then until like the next day or two when you had a bunch of those

02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:02.000
gamers or dead articles drop that's when i i remember specifically everyone coming together

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.720
to be like there's something wrong here yeah so from inside hold on just one second because i

02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:12.000
love this uh there's an article i wrote just before all of that stuff happened it's called

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:18.720
no skin is thick enough uh for polygon i was told at the time that was the third most read piece for

02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:26.320
that year um and this was before the zoe post it was talking about the horror and shit show

02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:32.640
that was happening to women in the game industry um you know starting with uh samantha allen

02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:38.000
basically quitting the entire game industry because of the doxing and harassment that she got

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:44.160
uh there's just been erased from all of this so um i i hear you and i believe you when you say

02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:48.080
that you weren't really aware of that but women in the game industry

02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:53.920
were it was really really bad for us two dollars to tell uh soya to put the shark back but uh go

02:41:53.920 --> 02:42:00.160
ahead okay well i'll get your two dollars back later but basically if um you know from my

02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:05.840
perspective being in a different part of the games industry yeah it it there were conversations

02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:13.840
around how do we expand the customers how do we get away from the toxic xbox call of duty crowd

02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:21.040
and this is where the gamers are dead sentiment was built i know that we had like the journal

02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:26.560
the journal list conspiracy which which was kind of proven and i've seen like different

02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:34.880
groups of people in media gather in private messages but then of course we also had similar

02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:42.400
things happen political organizing in 2016 so we we no one's innocent here from from like this

02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:49.760
collusion back back channels but it certainly did sort of like this overall position of the

02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:57.360
industry pushing for expanded customer base dismantling the aggression like dick wolves

02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:04.320
episode and all of this was pressing on industry to perform its image and i think that's why even

02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:10.160
if it was coordinated behind the scenes that's why we did have sentiment redefine gamers somehow

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:15.680
and just one more word on this um because i really i have nothing new to say on gamergate but just to

02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:20.960
to tackle what you're talking about people miss this historic part of the industry because this

02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:27.280
was when mobile started eating the lunch of triple a studios before gamergate one of this

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:33.360
bad game that i still enjoy it's called alpha protocol it's a mass effect clone i was made by

02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:39.760
sega i think the budget was like 20 million dollars or something this was this b-tier game

02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:45.920
that the game industry was able to produce just a few years before gamergate but mobile started

02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:52.080
changing it so much that we were looking for new audiences and we were realizing we couldn't keep

02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:57.040
talking to the exact same kind of people making these same kind of games because development was

02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:03.040
getting more expensive audiences were looking for something new so i like a lot of this stuff that

02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:08.720
got the core gamer so angry i i don't want to sound like a communist but it was capitalism

02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:13.840
right it was this force in the game industry to like find new people to buy your stuff

02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:20.080
i mean that's true to an extent um this is something i'm trying to i'm trying to work out

02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:26.240
in my head oh god and it's a it's much more complicated for this for this conversation um

02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:33.280
capitalism and communism don't really operate in the kind of dichotomy that most people think

02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:40.800
that it does you know because your answer to this question capitalism is okay fair enough go ahead

02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:48.160
well they they they both have like universalizing forces within them right because capitalism wants

02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:55.280
to um as you said in increase the consumer base in order to do that you need to appeal to a whole

02:44:55.280 --> 02:44:59.120
bunch of different demographics with different tastes which means you're gonna get yours too

02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:08.640
i don't have one this is not fair so basically as you as you increase your uh your install base

02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:14.560
for a product that means you have to start appealing to different types of people who

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:18.960
all have different different ideas about what they want to buy which means some sort of

02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.880
universalization of what you're offering right it has to be it has to be acceptable to 10 different

02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:29.040
types of people all with 10 different sensibilities which which necessarily leads to some sort of

02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.080
watering down so there's a capitalism has this universalizing effect but communism also has a

02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:38.480
universalizing effect and they're kind of like twins in that regard this is something that i

02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:44.480
don't fully understand yet i'm still trying to work it out in my head but i think like

02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:52.960
there is there is something corrosive to small communities whether they be online communities

02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:58.160
or even real life communities like small towns that capitalism brings into the equation that

02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:05.280
socialism or communism cannot actually solve it only exacerbates and i don't know what to do about

02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:11.280
it i don't quite know how to formulate this idea very vague i will say and also i can tell why some

02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:15.840
people might say that you're a subversive communist infiltrating right-wing spaces okay yeah probably

02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:22.160
yeah anything else before we let you go so i don't know yeah that kind of ironically what dev said

02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:29.920
kind of ironically goes into why i think the left is so bad on palestine right now because they are

02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:36.880
identity opportunists rather than being on mission and on mission would mean dismantling structures

02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:43.520
of oppression this is yes yeah and somewhat relating to what dev's saying is that okay so

02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:50.960
bland market consumer level you know twitch subscriber level socialism doesn't solve it

02:46:50.960 --> 02:47:00.160
because that's all about land back and you know all of the these groups of people are good and

02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:06.080
we should support them rather than we need to smash gender hierarchy and that's yeah that's

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:11.120
what being a leftist is well so that'll thank you for being here thank you for your questions and

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:18.080
thank you for the blah i don't know if i'm saying that right let's see let's go i love

02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.960
i could be mispronouncing his looks so new he's new on the blah train i've been here for years

02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:35.680
okay oh god five dollars from artemis dev was picking me weak for caving to online harassment

02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:41.040
he wants me to you know i'll just say yes fuck you this is like a meme in my community

02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:48.640
i'm not familiar but fair enough don't cave to the harassers gang it only makes them stronger never

02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:54.640
apologize um that's not true you should apologize if you do something wrong but there is a the crowd

02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:59.360
doesn't want you to say sorry it wants your blood right and it will so here's the thing like yeah

02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:06.480
i'm sure i've never experienced anything as bad as you have as you have as you have during gamer

02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:11.680
gabriella but i've been harassed on the internet as well you know yeah if you have if you have a

02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:16.400
channel of of any sort of size you get harassed for something somewhere right and the lesson i've

02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:22.480
learned is just never back down never apologize if you think you're right and it's a hard lesson

02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:27.040
to learn for sure but it's definitely served me well over the years where it's like no i actually

02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:30.560
think that i'm correct about this and i don't care if there's a thousand people who want my head

02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:36.800
i'm not going to give in i think there's some quality some psychology of you that i haven't

02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:45.120
quite figured out yet where you you mention a lot like there's like five or six videos about how you

02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:51.520
don't have trolls remorse and i i don't mean to put you on the psychologist couch but i think

02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:57.200
there's some part of you where your identity of yourself and the way you perceive yourself

02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:03.760
is is based in this kind of the edgy chats you were having back in the 2000s

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:10.960
and i still have don't worry and i i think it affects your analysis of things in a way that

02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:18.160
doesn't help you get to the right answers always maybe i i think it's just that you can

02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:25.760
you can always it never hurts to have a greater constitution you know sure and that's kind of how

02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:30.160
how i viewed i viewed things like that okay let's bring out we got a we got a few more

02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:34.160
now i want to get through on the callers gang i had um i know that i want to respect your time

02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:39.200
as well i'm just about done yeah i know so we'll we'll get through the current crop i'll make sure

02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:47.440
they are in a timely manner and then we'll close it out oh let's get them in hello you're live you

02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:54.640
got a question or a comment i suppose uh yes can you hear me we can what's up hello this is one of

02:49:54.640 --> 02:50:02.640
my viewers what's up dude uh hello uh i was just wondering do you think uh horseshoe theory is

02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:09.200
correct me or brianna brianna uh i'm getting sold on it

02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:17.440
uh it's hard to think it's right another one is do you guys think government should break up

02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:26.640
monopolies like intervene i think one of the things that makes america different than china

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:32.080
is if you look at the ascendance of something like bite dance uh you know china and the prc

02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:37.200
are just synonymous with bite dance anyone that tells you they're not is just lying to you

02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:43.360
outright and i do think that a good thing about this country is america tends to be a little bit

02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:51.280
more laissez faire in picking winners and losers so i i think that i actually really agree with

02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:56.400
elizabeth warren that when it comes to some of these really really big companies in the tech

02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:05.200
space though um we're really limiting innovation because no one else can operate in the space they

02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:11.040
get either bought up immediately or just crushed or a company like facebook will will just come in

02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:17.840
and dominate them by stealing their features so um i think in general i think over my lifetime the

02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:23.440
the government has gotten less willing to use their power to break up monopolies but i also

02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:30.400
think it needs to be done extremely extremely thoughtfully um because it's not always bad a

02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:38.000
really good example is uh in the game industry we've seen a move towards uh the model of things

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:45.120
like game games pass right where uh microsoft or sony will actually own the studio and then will

02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:51.520
fund direct development these kind of b-tier games this is good in some ways and it sustains a lot of

02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:58.000
smaller development studios that also leads to you know more vertical integration in the game

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:04.560
industry so i i don't think it's like either or i think that it's um i think we need to look at

02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:08.080
these situations but i think overall we've not used that power enough

02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:18.160
okay uh did you get your questions answered sir uh i got one more one more quickly uh

02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:26.160
hey dev what's that font you use in your videos uh the old one was called handy sands

02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:31.040
but in order for me to start using it legally it was gonna cost you like ten thousand fucking

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:38.240
dollars pieces yeah so i switched over to atma and i use atma bold all right find that you can

02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:43.200
find that for free on google fonts thanks all right thank you those are my questions all right

02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:50.560
bye go to blambot.com uh i've used them for my professional design work for years uh their

02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:57.280
licensing fees are very very reasonable very awesome awesome i guess real quick regarding his

02:52:57.600 --> 02:53:05.440
his horseshoe theory uh question the more i'll be very quick wick i'm sorry no it's not like we

02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:11.760
could like look we can we could talk all night if you want i just don't have to go yeah um

02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:15.200
basically like the more that i've been reading political theory the more that i've been convinced

02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:23.040
by horseshoe theory because i've yeah i keep i keep finding like these 1920s and 1930s socialists

02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:27.040
who are writing like fascists and i'm like how did this come about why is there this

02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:30.800
link between these two ideologies and the more i read the more that i'm like okay there's like

02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:34.400
a pipeline here or something something has to be going on here and it's been like obscured in the

02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:40.560
modern era because nobody reads political theory anymore but something's going on yeah i would uh

02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:49.040
on this i i don't know if policy wise it holds up horseshoe theory but i know behavior wise it

02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:55.760
absolutely does um the further you go to the extremes the more willing they are to engage

02:53:55.760 --> 02:54:01.200
in certain types of behaviors that if you go away from those extremes are seen as unacceptable

02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:08.720
so in that way i think horseshoe theory is is is a circle honestly um the more extreme fringes

02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:15.040
of certain beliefs are willing to any means necessary it no bad tactics just bad targets

02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:20.160
and we can see that on both sides and it is a problem it is absolutely it is something that

02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:24.720
we need to get away from immediately but yeah that's my thought uh you guys ready for the next

02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:31.040
call let's do it real quick real quick artemis foul two dollars ask dev how he lost his license

02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:36.240
he wants to reveal all my deep lore okay he's gonna have to if he wants to interrupt and and

02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:42.720
and things like that that's cool we like your money driver's license but uh when i was like 21

02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:49.920
i'm i'm not 21 anymore and i can i i'm fine now okay but way back in the day i drove a

02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:55.600
dump truck for the city of toronto i worked for the municipality awesome i was driving around

02:54:55.600 --> 02:55:01.840
with the back up because i had dumped a load and i forgot to put the bed down so i was driving down

02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:07.200
down the street with with the bed up and i went right through an intersection and took down all

02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:14.480
the power lines and the city was without power for for a little while so i was like you know what

02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:19.920
i i lost my license i got demoted i was i was back down to picking up garbage for the city again

02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.600
and uh it was a rough time for me for a while so i will tell you a quick story about driving

02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:31.920
a dump truck myself so in mississippi there's very very little to do but one of my best friends

02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:38.960
growing up uh his uh grandfather had uh basically this pit in the middle of the woods and they were

02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:43.920
out there you know chopping down the trees like basically chopping down the forest to make a bunch

02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:51.120
of money from it right so uh i actually learned how to pick locks in high school so we could then

02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:58.560
open the gate and go into the sand pit and this is the same year that i learned how to make fake ids

02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:05.520
so i was the only person in my high school class that could actually get us alcohol and i did so

02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:12.560
we would go out there and throw these huge parties in this bonfire pit and a bunch of 16 year olds

02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:18.320
getting drunk out of our mind and driving the wrecking ball around driving the dump truck around

02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:26.080
while students are in the back passed out of their mind like going and uh like like cranes bulldozers

02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:30.960
all this stuff i actually know how to operate all of that equipment because of the extremely

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:37.600
illegal stuff i was doing back then all right disavow all illegal activities i wag my finger

02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:44.240
okay well is this actually limitations passed on that or yeah yeah okay yeah good because people

02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:49.360
will sit on it and try to use it well anyway i've told this story many times president sunday's

02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:58.400
watching you know he might true true um go ahead uh new caller i'm sorry i don't know your name i

02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:05.280
stream things up hi you're live hey yeah it's grayboard oh i know cryborn one of my

02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:13.120
community members hello so uh brianna i um i was hoping uh you could you could kind of

02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:21.360
remind people what's at stake should republicans win in 2024 and why the uh left wing infighting

02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:28.000
is so so dangerous thank you for such a great question um you know trump is an existential

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:35.120
threat to democracy and uh you know he's certainly going to abuse his power to uh

02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:41.440
basically get revenge on his enemies and stop the uh rule of law from being implemented against him

02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:47.280
uh you know he has nothing to lose he's looking at prison time so you know uh trump himself is

02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:53.280
this existential threat to democracy additionally you know if you look at the uh fringe rightward

02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:59.120
tilt of the court i think one of the worst things that could happen is trump uh like appointing even

02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:07.520
more uh judges uh to the judiciary so it's really not an exaggeration to say if we don't get our

02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:14.400
shit together and work on winning 2024 i genuinely am not sure we're still going to have a country

02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:20.480
damn actually i have a question for you i have a question for you if you don't mind um

02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:27.200
do you think that trump genuinely believes that he won 2020 and he's just wrong about it

02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:32.320
or do you think that he knows he lost and he's just been coping i i don't have to surmise about

02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:36.960
this because it's all come out in the the cases against him where he's admitted in private

02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:43.440
people testified how he knows he lost and uh it was him just trying to keep power so don't take

02:58:43.440 --> 02:58:48.640
my word for it take it from the people that were there um if you have those could you send them to

02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:54.320
me i'm kind of curious yeah i'm it's very easily found but i will do that after the show

02:58:54.880 --> 02:58:59.680
okay great whoa wow thank you getting some information answered well thanks

02:59:48.240 --> 02:59:53.680
reference what i don't i've looked at that so many times i'm like what the hell uh so i started the

02:59:53.680 --> 02:59:58.720
channel in 2009 when it was like me and my friends kind of running around my small town with a camera

02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:05.280
and we were shooting um we were shooting anime content and the name just stuck from when i was

03:00:05.280 --> 03:00:11.840
younger it just stuck around so like yeah you know 2009 that was the era of like channel awesome on

03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:15.920
the internet right this was long before a lot of the nonsense we're facing now so we were like

03:00:15.920 --> 03:00:21.120
we're gonna be anime reviewers and we're gonna make it onto doug walker's website and that was

03:00:21.120 --> 03:00:27.760
like our big dream it didn't work out but actually i have like a bit of deep lore on that for for

03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:33.520
anybody who cares about fucking channel awesome lore from 15 years ago um we and after the channel

03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:38.560
got bigger we ended up applying again and they took us and then i rejected it because i just

03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:46.160
wanted to see that i could oh fightful okay spiteful one victory i have way over thought

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:52.080
this that i've thought for years because you know your voice is yeah you've got like you could be a

03:00:52.080 --> 03:00:57.680
voice actor professional voice actor you're really good at that right um and there's such a disconnect

03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:04.640
between like short fat otaku and your voice so i'm like is this an ironic commentary is this

03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:08.560
and i find out it's one of these situations like when you're playing somebody online

03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:13.920
and their username is like boobs are awesome and you're like okay they were 14 when they made that

03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:19.360
username that's that's basically what it is yeah yeah we got we got two more colors i want to be

03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:23.520
real quick with them then we're gonna let blue off the leash here and get get her out of here

03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:27.600
um uh but let's bring them on hello friend

03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:36.320
why we wait for him 10 more bucks from artemis fowl if the last message about

03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:39.840
trump being an existential threat is as important as you think it is why is trump gaining support

03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:45.360
across the board including 20 22 of african americans now we'll answer that question later

03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:53.120
uh but i would say it's simply uh the fact that people are tired they they view the economy as

03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:58.480
doing poorly whether or not or not it is that's how they view the economy and i think that's

03:01:58.480 --> 03:02:05.840
just driving things right i agree okay um okay you're here great excellent what's up

03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:12.800
you're live hey so first off since people already know i'm in the military so any statements i make

03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:17.280
are personal opinions are reflective of department of defense or the army anything like that got to

03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:22.880
do which uh which place should you serve in uh i'm in the army officer thank you very much for that

03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:28.240
no officer though oh well you guys are working i wish we had someone who worked for a living on

03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:37.840
but go ahead okay so i'll ask uh just one short question so i'm a big fan of jonathan height

03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:44.240
rider and elephant kind of stuff yeah so what what do you guys do to actually check

03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:50.480
your policies and social prescriptions that you support to make sure it's not the elephant in

03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:56.640
charge what's the elephant in charge can you help me understand that yeah yeah so okay so the basic

03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:03.600
idea is most people are not as rational as they think they are you're primarily controlled by

03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:11.200
instincts and emotion which is kind of like an elephant and then your rational mind is the person

03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:15.760
riding on top of the elephant the rider thinks they're in control but the elephant just kind

03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:23.760
of does what it does and you post hoc rationalize afterwards um i will answer this question first

03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:28.880
if i may um and then i'll let the stars of the show go but one of the things that i personally

03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:34.480
do to make sure that i am checking my biases making sure i'm not just knee-jerking is building

03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:40.000
a community like this where most of my community yells at me all the time right where i'm constantly

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:46.800
challenged i am in a space where i have other elephants to check my elephant if that makes sense

03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:54.080
right where i am challenged and i have we normalize being able to come to me directly and say wick

03:03:54.080 --> 03:04:00.560
you're being stupid you're being wrong you're being um irrational that's that's what i it's

03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:08.720
not perfect but that's that's my go-to anyway i think for me i mean earlier in the show i talked

03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:14.800
about how reactionary i was during gamergate uh you know speaking of trauma right so i think

03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:20.000
that's a really good example of where i failed um i can't think of any situation where i got really

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:26.000
really angry and posted a tweet response to that that it worked out well and i think part of the

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:34.720
good part of getting older is you you learn to uh to don't react that emotionally as often uh i

03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:39.920
clearly fail at this all the time uh you know my passion is just a part of my personality

03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:46.000
it's probably never going to go away but i think you try to surround yourself uh with uh people

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:51.600
you that you really value their counsel um something i think that has really been good at

03:04:51.600 --> 03:04:57.280
helping me get the right answer dev i think it's clear from this conversation tonight i genuinely

03:04:57.280 --> 03:05:03.360
watch your youtube channel even though i've had many criticisms of parts of that tonight right

03:05:03.360 --> 03:05:08.960
i i do spend a lot of time watching content i don't agree with because i do think it helps me

03:05:08.960 --> 03:05:13.360
make sure that my opinions are correct and yeah there's some stuff you've said that i've changed

03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:19.600
my mind on and i've admitted as much but yeah i think that uh that ability to hear another side

03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:27.040
is really really important i guess without a view it is when it comes to oh thanks by the way i do

03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:35.040
appreciate the fluffing um when it's genuine um when it comes to um the elephant and the rider

03:05:35.920 --> 03:05:41.440
when jonathan height lays out that example what he's basically saying is that if the elephant is

03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:46.080
calm the rider is capable of directing the elephant in the general direction that the

03:05:46.080 --> 03:05:52.240
rider wants to go but if the elephant is agitated the rider has no hope right and the best way you

03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:57.680
can do that is you can make the road as clear as possible so a lot of things that you can do

03:05:57.680 --> 03:06:04.480
to help along your own rationality is to before you get into any sort of heated debate before you

03:06:04.480 --> 03:06:09.920
ever actually have to use those precious cycles of brain power which are quite limited per day

03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:15.200
make sure that like your your environment is set you know make sure that your house is in order

03:06:15.200 --> 03:06:19.280
make sure your ideas are in order make sure that you've studied you've read make sure that you

03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:25.200
considered other things before you have to be tested on them right that that's probably the

03:06:25.200 --> 03:06:30.720
best way that you can avoid you know that that is the best way you can avoid saying something stupid

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:41.040
okay okay fair enough and and before i head off i will recommend to rihanna that you should

03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:47.840
absolutely read the righteous mind by jonathan height uh yes so yeah why isn't even this

03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:53.680
righteous mind tell me about this the righteous mind by jonathan height that is basically his

03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:59.040
his magnum opus it's the psychology of morality it's the six moral foundations we talked about

03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:04.480
earlier that that is that is the and it is free on audible i'm buying it right now boom

03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:09.440
you won't regret it thank you yeah what if i can ask what do you do in the army

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:14.960
yeah so uh i'm just an infantry officer so i'm not going to go into my specific job but i've done

03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:22.880
things from platoon leader company officership s3 in the shop time so just kind of all different

03:07:22.880 --> 03:07:29.280
kinds of jobs yeah just generally my branch is infantry thank you very much i appreciate

03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:35.760
veterans day tomorrow right i think it is uh i think though i think we're doing free

03:07:35.760 --> 03:07:42.400
applebees or something tomorrow but yeah uh again thanks for calling thanks for coming by and uh

03:07:42.400 --> 03:07:49.840
we'll see you later buddy no thanks for having me on officers i was an enlisted um it's a little

03:07:49.840 --> 03:07:55.440
bit of a different world yeah we don't have veterans day here but we have remembrance day

03:07:55.440 --> 03:08:00.480
and it's pretty much the same thing um do americans have the tradition of wearing poppies for it or no

03:08:01.600 --> 03:08:07.680
no i've never heard of that no um no pretty much just just uh we put a support the troops sticker

03:08:07.680 --> 03:08:12.800
on our car and then send them off for war and then give them no health care fireworks and

03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:20.400
barbecues fireworks yeah but listen if you're if you're ever in canada or or the uk or in australia

03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:24.640
or new zealand there's a tradition where on november 11th which is remembrance day in these

03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:30.320
countries everyone wears a poppy on their shirt and you can generally buy a poppy for like 25

03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:36.080
cents at any store and all that money goes towards the military oh that's a good idea like like

03:08:36.080 --> 03:08:40.960
veteran stuff yeah uh one last caller i'm sorry there's two and things but one came in a little

03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:52.240
late sorry uh let's get infallible foul infallible foul you're live you're on air what is up i was

03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:56.080
wondering about something you guys were talking about a little bit earlier and maybe that's a

03:08:56.080 --> 03:09:01.920
little bit of bias that i have just because i'm not seeing this from a right wing perspective

03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:07.520
but when i feel like when people talk about the right and they talk about usually the individual

03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:12.080
like this person did this wrong this person did that but i've been hearing a lot especially in

03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:18.000
the spit this space around here is the left has progressives have an anti-Semitic problem

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:23.120
i've been seeing earlier you said horseshoe theory now uh what is it do you think about

03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:28.320
having maybe like a little bit more fiscally liberal policies would make somebody more of

03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:36.000
a scumbag and have more about far bright extremist opinion in life i don't

03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:40.960
that was apparently like we were talking horseshoe theory

03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:48.240
what do you mean i don't understand what you're saying yeah rephrase sir if you can't oh wick

03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:54.960
you're talking about horseshoe theory you had a title up that said uh the left anti-semitism

03:09:54.960 --> 03:10:01.520
problem that is not willing so when we say the left right um it's not just oh i'm a leftist

03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:07.520
because i have i believe in these fiscal policies and things like that the left as a term covers a

03:10:07.520 --> 03:10:15.600
broad tent of belief structures and things like that um and this is by design um so that we can

03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:21.840
uh coalesce and do this kind of like a cooperative action this community action in order to get

03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:26.240
things passed so we'll put aside our differences in order to come together to fight against the

03:10:26.240 --> 03:10:32.480
things that we think are bad and to promote the things that we think are good my whole um thing

03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:39.360
that i have observed of late after october 7th especially is how many people are willing to

03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:46.480
overlook anti-semitism because they believe in the oppressor versus the oppressed kind of dynamic

03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:55.120
going on in the israeli-palestine conflict and they don't just keep their um criticism

03:10:55.120 --> 03:11:02.640
towards the israeli state but they again talk in the most extreme terms and are willing to put up

03:11:02.640 --> 03:11:10.320
with again just dehumanizing jewish individuals um in order to because they hate israel so much

03:11:10.320 --> 03:11:15.360
they're willing to overlook anti-semitism and that's a problem and we need to address that

03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:20.960
that's my i i just think there is a lot a large part of the audience that does feel like it was

03:11:20.960 --> 03:11:25.760
kind of generalized and a lot of them were frustrated with you and i think that's that's

03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:32.000
fair to be frustrated but they i'm frustrated with them right back because again i am not saying that

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:39.920
everyone on the left is anti-semitic obviously not but if we we can't pretend that there's none

03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:46.080
and when people bring it up you can't can't get mad at it we have to clean our own house

03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:51.360
we have to keep it in order we cannot let the cancer spread we saw what happened to the right

03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:56.000
when the right let its crazies take over and dictate and become the elephant that drove the

03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:02.000
rider we cannot let that happen and so we must push back excise and get rid of the people who

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:09.200
are cancer in our party and in our movements and there are many many many that i think are

03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:15.600
mask on amongst us but for a brief moment on october 7th they dropped their mask and we saw

03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:22.320
this with um not only online activity with people asking like what do you think decolonization looks

03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:29.280
like and gang next every time i hear could be colonized that that is as a term tainted for me

03:12:29.280 --> 03:12:33.760
forever yeah right i will never hear decolonization said in a way that doesn't

03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:40.640
make me think oh that's what they mean right that was ugly okay so if i can take a swing at that yeah

03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:46.560
i hear what you're saying wick um so when i know if you're a traditional republican that wants

03:12:46.560 --> 03:12:54.560
low taxes and you know little government regulation maybe even you have a some questions about uh what

03:12:54.560 --> 03:12:59.680
our school board policy should be and how much we're talking about like same-sex marriage stuff

03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:05.600
like that that to me is just bread and butter normie republican stuff uh i don't have any issue

03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:11.360
with that i want to beat you at the ballot box i don't agree with you but i think that is democracy

03:13:11.360 --> 03:13:16.560
these are some stats this is according to the university of washington uh so this is from maga

03:13:16.560 --> 03:13:21.120
supporters and the percentage of maga supporters according to the university of washington that

03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:29.120
supported trump's election fraud claims was almost 98 the number of maga sports distrust the 2020

03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:35.280
presidential election results was 97 the number of maga people that believe voting shouldn't be

03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:44.480
easier is over 90 distrust this distrust the 2020 congressional results is almost uh 80 percent so

03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:50.400
over and over and over again i think you're seeing this more on the right it certainly exists on the

03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:56.080
left but there's a strain on the right of fundamentally not believing in democracy not

03:13:56.080 --> 03:14:02.000
believing in the rule of law and seeing the opposition as an enemy in a way that you truly

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:07.440
want to see them destroyed not just beating them at the ballot box but you think they're so evil

03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:13.600
that you just want to like this is why you see the national divorce and talk of the second civil war

03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:20.080
from the right so i and what really worries me is i see the same sentiment growing on the left

03:14:20.080 --> 03:14:25.600
part of why i'm taking this blow like professionally in calling it out is i

03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:29.760
don't want the left to become a mirror of the right i think that would be a really dark fate

03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:36.800
for the country any thoughts on this sfo i know it's uh yeah you're the opposition here but go

03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:44.800
ahead well i mean you're you're characterized him as a right right away now look at that

03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:50.000
i guess that's not what i said that's not what i said no no rick just did yeah because it's

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:56.160
funny but go ahead so here's the thing right like i don't remember what it was but there was

03:14:56.160 --> 03:15:01.760
definitely something that made me feel over 10 years ago what basically you're feeling right

03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:08.640
now brianna it's like oh there is actually some some dark evil underneath all of the good rhetoric

03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:13.120
of the left and there is actually some serious problems here and i think anyone who ever went

03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:17.920
through like that i'm leaving the left or i've been abandoned by the left arc which you hear

03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:22.080
like tim pool says that about himself i think she won head might say it about herself maybe yeah

03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:26.880
there's been like a bunch of people online who have said that i think a lot of that is it's not

03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:34.960
that the left has has left anyone behind it's a realization that not in terms of policy because

03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:40.560
policy is different from location to location in terms of philosophy the left actually is not

03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:46.400
morally superior to the right and when that comes out people are kind of stunned like oh

03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:50.800
oh okay and then then they have to go through like a moment of awakening i think

03:15:52.080 --> 03:16:00.160
so if it's i i don't think i've ever thought we were morally i mean you gotta understand because

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:05.280
of my unique background like when i think about republicans i do think about all the people i

03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:11.360
know back down home in mississippi right they're they're good people they go to church uh they are

03:16:11.360 --> 03:16:18.960
living in society that is still very much bearing the weight this open wound of segregation in the

03:16:18.960 --> 03:16:23.760
civil war has been largely forgotten by the rest of the country i think they are racist in ways

03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:32.800
they don't understand i think their policies are wrong and i think we need to um to denounce that

03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:38.480
but are they fundamentally evil people and i'm a good person i don't i've never thought that's

03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:44.640
true right like i think people are people and i think the more time you spend like actually going

03:16:44.640 --> 03:16:52.800
out and doing politics in the real world you'll see like there's the like i've never talked to

03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:58.400
anyone i couldn't find something that i liked something about them right so i i don't know

03:16:58.400 --> 03:17:03.200
i've just never seen it in that moral black and white and i think that's why what's happening to

03:17:03.200 --> 03:17:08.080
you right now is happening yeah i've definitely met leftists both online and off who thought that

03:17:08.080 --> 03:17:15.520
they were just superior for their beliefs yeah well that is that is a thing and it does speak

03:17:15.520 --> 03:17:22.240
to horseshoe theory um but like i look i i've been going off on this for a while now on my show i

03:17:22.240 --> 03:17:26.960
know people are probably tired about it but i think it's very very important that we have to

03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:34.080
recognize our own internal issues because if we don't it's going to be a problem and it's hard i

03:17:34.080 --> 03:17:38.720
know it's hard it's hard to recognize that the people you thought were on your side are probably

03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:44.720
probably not on your side really um and yeah it's just a struggle we're going to write actually i

03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:49.280
actually want to amend what i said it's not only that they think that they're superior it's a it's

03:17:49.280 --> 03:17:55.200
that even in their superiority if it were real they have no humility about it and that's really

03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:59.920
the killer because sometimes you do just just have a better idea right but you you have to

03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:04.320
you have to be humble in victory and i think that's something the left has a problem with

03:18:05.200 --> 03:18:10.320
yeah i i agree with that i think that's why you see a lot of this rhetoric where like i've been

03:18:10.320 --> 03:18:16.480
called a genocide supporter more times today than i can even count even though i'm very strong

03:18:17.120 --> 03:18:23.520
strongly pro-palestine i've said many times like we need to stop civilian death there right so i

03:18:23.520 --> 03:18:30.720
certainly understand that tendency to really moralize things really really quickly so okay

03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:35.840
and fallible owl thank you for calling in any last comment any last words comrade before we

03:18:35.840 --> 03:18:40.640
send you to the void yeah i was just gonna say that i think that a little bit that you have to

03:18:40.640 --> 03:18:44.320
think about because i think you they get it you look at it from a moderate perspective and you

03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:51.680
think moderates are the good ones and no bad people from all sides moderate moderation people

03:18:51.680 --> 03:18:57.680
moderation moderates there there's times to be radical and extreme there's time to be moderate

03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:02.560
and you have to be able to recognize which is which um i do think that moderates tend to do

03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:10.080
less harm overall simply by dint of their style of engaging with things but that doesn't mean that

03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:17.440
they're right um and i'm not like people call me like a centrist but i'm not i'm solidly well on

03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:22.240
progressive right i'm solidly left-leaning i'm not a hundred percent left-leaning but i'm pretty

03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:30.000
close um i do i do really think that extremism is way worse in moderation though in most cases

03:19:30.880 --> 03:19:34.960
i can set myself a little bit further left but i call out people on the left to do shit that

03:19:34.960 --> 03:19:38.800
i don't agree with well then when they're when they're celebrating hamas in the streets i think

03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:45.600
you should call that out brother thank you for coming on foul thanks okay um i know that you

03:19:45.600 --> 03:19:52.800
have to go well so i'm going to give you the mic to tell people is it time who you are i mean it's

03:19:52.800 --> 03:19:58.960
9 20 it's a three hour and 20 minute show i mean i'm i'm i'm down for i gotta read a couple more

03:19:58.960 --> 03:20:04.000
super chats here so i'll be on for a little bit longer take your time take your time so here's

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:09.520
the thing just just real quickly i've been taking notes and there's probably too many things to

03:20:09.520 --> 03:20:14.640
really go into today because there's like this is how every conversation is right like you have an

03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:18.560
idea but then the conversation moves on and like you could have gone a different way so we should

03:20:18.560 --> 03:20:25.120
probably do this again sometime yeah and and i just just really quickly though i i've noticed

03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:31.120
there's like a trend with you and me on twitter where i will dig up something that is like truly

03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:36.560
ridiculous on the left and you're like flabbergasted i mean you're like do you know what i'm talking

03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:42.880
about yeah yeah because there's the one time where it's like hey here's an article by some random

03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:47.200
leftist who thinks that we should abolish nuclear families because it would be better for liberation

03:20:47.200 --> 03:20:52.400
and then see when i say things like um government should be liberal people should be conservative

03:20:52.960 --> 03:20:58.080
i'm looking at you know the the end result of the march of progress where we're now tearing

03:20:58.080 --> 03:21:02.240
down things that are essential and we're slandering them as conservative and tearing

03:21:02.240 --> 03:21:05.360
things down as essential to like human life and it's like well i don't want to do that you know

03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:09.280
i think that nuclear families are actually good you know it's good for most people to be in a

03:21:09.280 --> 03:21:15.440
nuclear family so that's kind of where i'm coming from yeah no i get it i get it um i mean i watch

03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:21.200
your tick tock tuesday videos they're my favorite but i think you do you don't have to watch those

03:21:21.200 --> 03:21:27.280
they're ridiculous no but you show some stuff that's crazy and it blows my mind genuinely so

03:21:27.280 --> 03:21:35.760
there it is okay um where where could people find you what would you if you could will like pitch

03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:40.400
anything to my audience right now to dev's audience what would it be i get involved with

03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:46.160
the 2024 election i'm doing a ton of work with progressive victory uh we are going to be starting

03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:53.120
an mvp canvassing house with death with destiny very very soon i'm really excited about that

03:21:53.120 --> 03:21:57.920
uh deep canvassing is something we've really learned in the democratic party and this is the

03:21:57.920 --> 03:22:04.080
way it works um if you have people that are kind of embedded in the community and they're constantly

03:22:04.080 --> 03:22:09.600
going out to you know fish fries and knocking on doors and truly getting to know people in the

03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:15.280
community and forming those deep relationships um it doesn't just help you win one election it

03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:20.960
helps you start to turn a whole community around and you know something steven has never gotten

03:22:20.960 --> 03:22:27.360
credit for is his commitment to electoral politics and really making a difference i understand why

03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:34.320
his hot takes uh uh get the most attention but i think underneath that is someone who truly

03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:39.440
loves this country and wants to do his part so uh that's going to be coming up really soon

03:22:39.440 --> 03:22:44.480
uh we're going to have ways for y'all to get uh involved with that so i hope that you will

03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:50.560
this country's worth fighting for well thank you uh brianna for spending some time with us today

03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:55.520
and we'll see you next week when we have just one thing and that's looking forward to that

03:22:55.520 --> 03:23:00.400
and maybe uh uh deb may sometime we can play smash brothers or something on your strength

03:23:00.400 --> 03:23:07.680
that'd be a good old time do you play do you play street fighter six uh no no what i'm playing

03:23:07.680 --> 03:23:13.760
project zomboid right now actually that's the big one there we go learn street fighter six my jury's

03:23:13.760 --> 03:23:19.440
pretty fierce rihanna rihanna wants to take you to task okay rihanna we're gonna let you go we'll

03:23:19.440 --> 03:23:25.120
see you later bye-bye have a good evening what a great what a great you just kick her out and

03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:30.720
she leave i i i move them off move along all right once they're done okay we do what we do

03:23:30.720 --> 03:23:37.520
we got to keep it snappy okay efficiency okay okay that's okay um so now i have you here just

03:23:37.520 --> 03:23:41.600
i won't keep you very much longer but i do have a question we can stay till the end i mean it's

03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:46.400
super chats to do right yeah yeah super chats to do um but before we get to those i will ask you

03:23:46.400 --> 03:23:57.200
this um how do you think that went um about what i thought like there's uh there was definitely

03:23:57.200 --> 03:24:00.560
some people who were saying who were like messaging me and being like don't talk to

03:24:00.560 --> 03:24:06.640
brianna she's a snake and i'm like you know i can kind of understand that point of view because she

03:24:06.640 --> 03:24:11.120
was crazy 10 years ago but i've also seen her make the rounds for the like past year or so and she's

03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:19.120
been very reasonable i do i i whatever faults she had 10 years ago that created this negative um

03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:24.720
this negative view of her on on some parts of the internet they're they're definitely it's she's not

03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:31.360
who she was and i kind of knew that it was going to be a much more reasonable conversation um and

03:24:31.360 --> 03:24:36.560
it was pretty much what i expected you know no i get you i think that there's this tendency for us

03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:43.920
to hang the worst or worst selves onto onto others like their worst selves their worst moments

03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:52.320
and that's all they ever are um i can i can attest that through working with her right i didn't know

03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:55.680
her very much i didn't know her at all i didn't talk to her at all during the gamergate years or

03:24:55.680 --> 03:25:00.320
things like that probably wouldn't have um but she's always been square with me she's always

03:25:00.320 --> 03:25:05.840
treated me fairly and i haven't seen her um do anything duplicitous or backstabby or anything

03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:14.080
like that if there were snake times before fair enough but i don't see them now um i will say that

03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:21.200
like she's genuine when she wants to just work with others not just because um it's just a good

03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:27.040
thing to do and want to change but like from a pragmatic standpoint it's just it's just better

03:25:27.040 --> 03:25:31.920
to build than to tear down it's better to build bridges like that and i think that um we're

03:25:32.160 --> 03:25:36.480
we're working on it we're bringing her around so we'll smooth out that's a conservative point of

03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:42.960
view wick you're not liberating things you're conserving them you know what my policies that

03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:51.840
i advocate for um much like you're saying right are writ large for the community as a whole when

03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:57.040
it comes to my personal stances and things like that i do believe that we are masters of our own

03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:03.680
destiny and we need to take um accountability and responsibility for what we do and what we

03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:09.040
put into the world and i do think that things are worth conserving i'm not i'm not progress

03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:15.120
i'm not i'm not progressive for progress's sake there i want to progress to certain things to

03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:19.680
certain points to certain outcomes and i don't think we need to throw the baby out with the

03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:26.560
bath water in order to get there um there's just no need for it to tear down when we can uh reform

03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:31.840
and rebuild but i don't know um let's ask these uh super chats real quick because

03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:35.440
artemis fowl has been very generous and i want to make sure that he gets his money

03:26:36.080 --> 03:26:41.680
he has that glowy money and you know what i'm here for it okay i'm here for it um ten dollars

03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:47.120
the same side that claimed that supporting israel and jews in israel is anti-semitic but became

03:26:47.120 --> 03:26:52.000
amazingly nuanced when it comes to hamas and the palestinians who support the killing of jews

03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:57.680
i guess it's not a question so much but yeah it's it's one of those things where

03:26:58.960 --> 03:27:04.240
it's it's so easy to be hypocritical because you can have like 18 million different stances and

03:27:04.240 --> 03:27:09.360
18 million different topics and so whatever ends up serving your politics i think is what a lot of

03:27:09.360 --> 03:27:15.120
extreme people do they will like they'll think they'll they will um you know i i gotta find that

03:27:15.120 --> 03:27:20.320
exact jesus christ i think i think my brain's starting to melt let me find it here yeah so

03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:24.800
basically they'll they'll claim racism when it cuts one way and they'll claim liberation when

03:27:24.800 --> 03:27:28.480
it cuts the other way you know it's one of those things where it doesn't matter that it doesn't

03:27:28.480 --> 03:27:33.600
make sense what only matters is that you say the two statements far enough apart from each other

03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:38.800
that no one notices and this is this is why i'm harping on this and i know people are tired of me

03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:46.160
harping on this but people are seeing this like we see people high profile figures have left very

03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:52.400
leftist chapters the dsa has bleeding membership right from high profile members like there there's

03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:58.640
october 7th has created this fissure amongst the left that i don't think we've reckoned with yet

03:27:58.640 --> 03:28:03.120
and not just the left the rights rights the right's currently trying to to decide which

03:28:03.120 --> 03:28:07.360
it hates more muslims or jews right and they're going to fight about that for a while but on the

03:28:07.360 --> 03:28:14.960
left like we have this uh there there are people who thought we were going for one thing that

03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:22.080
have realized that oh no those memes that the republicans were trying to make you into

03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:27.040
no those are actually that's actually what you actually wanted and uh what and so we have this

03:28:27.040 --> 03:28:31.760
kind of uh fight going on right now but we'll get through it we'll get we'll get past it hopefully

03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:36.960
yeah um five more dollars there's nothing more delicious or decadent than to be able to hate with

03:28:36.960 --> 03:28:42.880
a moral conscience that is currently the only thing the left offers i don't think that's true

03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:49.920
but fair enough that's a huxley quote quote it is uh well a bastardized huxley quote he didn't

03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:55.680
talk about the left but fair enough yeah okay is there anything um that you thought we should

03:28:55.680 --> 03:29:01.840
have gotten to that we didn't get to tonight my entire list of things well fair enough fair

03:29:01.840 --> 03:29:06.960
enough maybe like something like was there any like elephants in the room that we didn't tackle

03:29:06.960 --> 03:29:13.600
that you like wick i can't believe you didn't bring up this um no i don't think so i don't

03:29:13.600 --> 03:29:18.240
think so i mean a lot of everything was brought up it's just that i probably had more to say on

03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:22.400
a topic but then it kind of moved on it's like oh well that's how it is that's how it is sometimes

03:29:22.960 --> 03:29:29.360
um two dollars from testicle johnson vote vivek 2024 um thank you for the two dollars okay um

03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:35.200
and if there's nothing else though i mean dev looks like a professional smash player that's one

03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:40.880
of them oh there you go two dollars from artemis valley i'm looking at him i do need to get better

03:29:40.880 --> 03:29:44.640
at reading these things i need to figure out like either a time where like in the middle of the

03:29:44.640 --> 03:29:49.440
discussion we can pause i can just read them all or at the end or something but people want to

03:29:49.440 --> 03:29:53.440
people want to get their question into the discussion and so i've been trying to

03:29:53.440 --> 03:29:56.960
figure out the best way to integrate it it's a struggle but we'll get through it there's

03:29:56.960 --> 03:30:01.840
definitely like it's good to like have breaks or like minutes where you go to the washroom or

03:30:01.840 --> 03:30:05.360
something and you start checking out the super chats something like that that's pretty normal

03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:11.760
i think fair enough okay um well thank you for coming on today is there anything uh you want

03:30:11.760 --> 03:30:18.320
to say before i let you go um i don't think so okay i mean your honor agreed to talk again and

03:30:18.320 --> 03:30:23.600
we can always talk again i just i will absolutely reach out to you and uh have you on again for a

03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:34.000
variety of ideas so i have on my calendar for some reason wick 15 november 15 did you give me

03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:41.040
a date for anything if i have i'm gonna have to check my messages i document all the things that

03:30:41.040 --> 03:30:46.160
i invite people to so i'll have to look do you have anything going on in the 15th no but the

03:30:46.160 --> 03:30:52.000
16th is when no opinion comes on so okay maybe this is just an aspirational thing that you wanted

03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:55.680
to come on the 15th for i don't know what i'm doing oh you know what it might have been

03:30:55.680 --> 03:30:59.840
there was that there was that one person on twitter what's their what's their name i don't

03:30:59.840 --> 03:31:04.240
remember yeah but they wanted to talk but then like it kind of like fell apart maybe that's what

03:31:04.240 --> 03:31:09.840
it was um yeah i look if we still want that to happen i know that you're tagging me all the time

03:31:09.840 --> 03:31:14.640
to bring people on to fight you it's fun i'm just like no i could still make that one happen that

03:31:14.640 --> 03:31:20.480
one is something that i can make happen i just don't like they on talking to them i don't know

03:31:21.440 --> 03:31:28.160
precisely what the issue is like with carl max i knew what you guys were going to talk about right

03:31:28.160 --> 03:31:34.160
um with this one i don't i think she just doesn't like you i i think i think it would be a bog

03:31:34.160 --> 03:31:39.680
standard socialism is better conversation fair enough and i think even as somebody who's not

03:31:39.680 --> 03:31:43.840
a debater i think that would i could just like kind of walk through that and just be like yep

03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:48.480
here it is yep yep but yeah i'll uh if you want i'll uh reach out to that and see if they can make

03:31:48.560 --> 03:31:53.440
me happy i know sunday's been desperately trying to get you on from anything but uh

03:31:53.440 --> 03:32:00.720
it's funny to watch you tell him no so yeah i just here i know he's listening i understand

03:32:01.600 --> 03:32:07.920
here here's your your one drop of attention here you go but you know in terms of i think

03:32:07.920 --> 03:32:12.000
her name was jaylen or something um i mean like i'm interested in talking to her it's always fun

03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:16.960
okay because but i think it wouldn't be a fruitful conversation i think it would be rehashing why

03:32:17.040 --> 03:32:21.680
socialism sucks and then coping and then it would be like okay well there we go those can be fun

03:32:21.680 --> 03:32:28.480
and those can be uh look we go through the the the what the the standards the classics if you will

03:32:28.480 --> 03:32:32.800
of debates right like there's certain types of content that will always draw views they're

03:32:32.800 --> 03:32:38.720
evergreen um are women bad in the various forms gets a lot of attention gets a lot of views right

03:32:40.240 --> 03:32:44.080
you know socialism versus capitalism that's another one that gets a lot of attention a lot

03:32:44.080 --> 03:32:49.280
of views so there's these uh these evergreen topics we can always make it work uh people

03:32:49.280 --> 03:32:54.880
are asking are you going to stream are you going to start doing streaming uh no they're they're

03:32:54.880 --> 03:32:58.880
asking me if i'm going to do my gaming stream oh so here's the thing here's the thing whenever i

03:32:58.880 --> 03:33:03.120
fire up fiber politics stream because i'm not i'm not a consistent streamer like like everyone

03:33:03.120 --> 03:33:06.720
else in twitch poll i don't i do not do that sort of thing i've thought about it like streaming

03:33:06.720 --> 03:33:12.000
every day for twitch poll but i don't know i don't know if that's that's me right but um

03:33:12.560 --> 03:33:18.560
i do stream once a week like a weekly news show on sunday and whenever i stream that lowest point

03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:23.280
i get like 200 viewers highest point i get like a thousand so i can do pretty good for myself as a

03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:30.720
streamer i think very cool when i stream video games i get between like 20 and 50 those are

03:33:30.720 --> 03:33:37.200
wick numbers right there but now it's it's that's great but like the the core viewers love that

03:33:37.200 --> 03:33:40.000
shit they love the gaming streams and they're always tuning in and they're

03:33:40.560 --> 03:33:45.200
so the ones who ask me dev where are you are you streaming tonight dev it's always like that core

03:33:45.200 --> 03:33:49.520
audience and they're the ones who want the the smaller like intimate streams and they ask me

03:33:49.520 --> 03:33:54.720
like every night every night what i'm doing probably not tonight guys i think i think this

03:33:54.720 --> 03:33:59.360
ran too late and also i was working on uh i was hoping to get the next video out today it's

03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:04.240
probably going to be tomorrow at this rate but i was working on that all day so i don't i think

03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:11.120
basically um i'm doing the archcast tomorrow afternoon so i'll either stream some gaming

03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:15.920
stuff either before or after the archcast tomorrow i think okay well with that gang

03:34:15.920 --> 03:34:21.600
we're gonna let you go remember monday we're gonna have the mental illness stream with uh

03:34:21.600 --> 03:34:28.080
