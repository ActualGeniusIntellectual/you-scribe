13520	21680	to the serious and gang we have a show for you today. Many moons ago, years ago, mortal enemies
21680	27920	a battlefield littered with rhetorical corpses and champions on either side standing strong
27920	34880	eyeing each other across a moonlit field swords at the ready blood staining everything they did
34880	43200	today however both sit before you right in a much more peaceful setting a calm setting
43200	50640	and we're going to discuss well all sorts of things today we have the wonderful Brianna Wu here

93600	99840	has been censored by big tech i might have youtube is up there you go you just popped in okay okay
99840	106000	just took a minute that's a that sounds like a maybe a canadian slowness they're always a little
106000	111520	bit behind so yeah i'll real quickly i'll tweet out that this is happening beautiful thank you
111520	120080	thank you um but yeah i wanted to just kind of get um get the temperature check just in general
120080	126800	i know that there's been a lot of really heavy discourse of late online um and in spaces so i
126800	131840	just wanted to make sure like how how are we feeling uh brianne you privated a bunch of your
131840	137440	stuff today what what happened i i'm just tired of getting yelled at by my own sidewalk and it's
137440	142640	not more complicated than that though i never privated my twitter even during gamer gate and
142640	149280	that's just how bad it's been lately um yeah there's nothing to it it's just um yeah i think
149280	156320	it's and dev i i don't know how you feel but i think it's really clear that a portion of my own
156320	164240	movement has uh certainly been engaged in apologia for uh you know october 7th and uh i've tried to
164240	169440	push back on that even though i stand with you know the palestinian people and uh it's just
169440	174320	really been uh really unpleasant lately um so i've just i've had enough that's it
177360	183040	here to be alive be with us i'm posting the final message okay okay let's let him get his tweet out
183600	190320	i i've just annoyingly added everyone in my discord that'll work well thank you i appreciate it
190320	196160	yeah no problem no problem um but um to that right um you've been watching this from afar
196160	200720	i've seen you tweet on it i've seen you reply to posts and things dev what what is your take on
200720	206080	this whole situation on ocuber 7th like the israel no on the uh the discourse surrounding it to be
206080	212560	clear right um it's cancerous yeah i expect that from the internet at this point to be honest
212640	217440	i've i've seen so many so many news cycles where people will take the most extreme
217440	224400	version of events push it just outside the realm of truth so that people who agree with them still
224400	228080	still hold on to it because it's still somewhat truthful and then they just roll with they just
228080	232560	run with the narrative right like i've seen right wingers do this with a whole bunch of things
232560	237200	concerning trump i've seen left wingers do this with the whole like for for the past 10 years
237200	240320	discourse has been a nightmare online in my opinion i'm old enough to remember what it was
240320	246640	like before i think it was it was still bad 10 years ago i think it was bad 15 years ago
246640	253280	i think it is definitely getting worse um but i think part of that is you know when you and i
253280	258480	were growing up deaf and i assume we're roughly the same age because the music from your videos
258480	264400	is like parasite eve and final fantasy 8 so i just assume you love those for the same reasons i do
264560	270000	i grew up in the 90s yeah yeah yeah i mean the the the normies just were not online it was only
270000	276480	people like us so i think that the addition to the uh to the cool kids has uh really made the
276480	283360	internet a much worse place to be it used to just be uh yeah um sexism and now it's terrorist
283360	291040	apology so that's not good ah there was i know there were definitely some real sexist back in
291040	294960	the day but there was also a lot of joking around too yeah sometimes sometimes it was hard to tell
294960	300720	the difference between the two but uh yeah things have gotten worse for sure yeah definitely i guess
300720	309200	on that note right like of back in the day um i guess i'll just ask this to you first brianna
309200	315120	and i'm curious what dev would have to say uh i'm again as i alluded to before there were a lot of
316080	322000	well we've we've had a lot on online presence for a long time um how do you feel you've grown since
322000	329440	then and in what ways right oh boy that's a long question well we got a long time i set aside two
329440	335360	hours for y'all we gotta talk about something right well i think you one of the thing the
335360	341840	things is the older you get um i i think that if you do it correctly you're you're constantly
341840	347200	changing and growing and you you take in new information i don't think that's true for everyone
347840	355120	i think that some people uh get really static the older that they get but for me you know i i think
355120	362640	you keep i think you keep adding new information and hopefully like ending up at better answers um
362640	368400	i think for me personally one way i've grown is just getting more and more and more over the
368480	374640	trauma of my childhood which makes me less reactive uh though i can certainly be reactive
374640	382480	but um not being in that fight or flight mode all the time um is certainly helpful um i i think that
383520	391200	one of the really big changes in me personally today versus the gamergate era is i've seen
391200	396880	like jessabelle just closed yesterday who was a huge force in the gamergate years i love jessabelle
396880	402880	i love most of the writers at jessabelle and i think like the the financial collapse of that
402880	408800	particular business model you know part of it is due to mismanagement by uh the private equity
408800	418240	firm that bought them out but i also think part of it is we have the tactics of feminism that
418240	425600	we've employed for the last 10 15 years are clearly not resulting in a vibrant movement
425600	432560	it's not resulting in more real world rights um it's not resulting in a conversation about what
432560	439280	women are facing and i think for me personally the biggest lesson i've taken is that internet
439280	446160	screaming does not really equate to real world policies if that makes sense oh that makes sense
446160	454080	to me right like do we have to ask ourselves like is what we're doing moving us towards what we want
454080	459440	or is it moving us away or is it just like making us shred water um i i've seen a lot of posts and
459440	465600	this is kind of not a non-soc whatever a little bit of an aside of people who are swearing they're
465600	470480	never going to vote for joe biden right they're like oh i will never vote for genocide joe is that
470480	476160	what the term they use like and then the question you ask is like well considering that you want
476160	484080	policies that genocide joe will support and the other options will not what what do you think
484080	489280	you're accomplishing here is this moving you closer to your political objectives or is it
489280	494000	moving you further away and i think we all kind of have to ask that but i want to isn't just well
494000	499440	hold on because this will piggyback into dev you know dev one of the reasons i enjoy your videos is
499440	505040	i think um and before people online scream at me i do think you come up with a lot of things are
505040	511040	structurally are wrong with the directions that progressives are going that's not to say i agree
511040	516800	with the conclusion she reached but i think you've really put your finger on some of the things that
516800	522240	are wrong with our movement today and one of those are the purity spiral that you have an excellent
522240	527760	video about and the utopianism that we kind of fall into so i would love to hear like from your
527760	532880	point of view how you feel about that well i mean i'm not a progressive right i don't view myself
533120	541280	aggressive so you're not no no like i'm glad we got that settled i was curious right i
541280	546080	i view myself as like an adam and sitch style enlightened centrist you know i definitely do
546080	550400	not like the right wing there are some serious problems on on the right i grew up with the right
550400	555920	wing trying to censor video games and and wanting to repress gay people and i didn't like any of
555920	562400	that when i was when i was younger um and i think because the right wing was so ascendant in the 90s
562480	567040	at least culturally um it was easy to be a leftist it was easy to be like a cent like maybe not
567040	571040	not like a communist or anything but it was easy to be like you know why shouldn't we have health
571040	574320	care i mean we have health care in canada but why shouldn't america have health care right why
574320	578560	shouldn't we have gay marriage these were kind of easy they're like slam dunks for people who are
578560	585280	left-leaning right um but the slam dunks are kind of drying up and now you have tougher questions
585280	590400	on the left and the answers to those questions aren't exclusively leftist because because now
590400	594240	you're getting into like more esoteric things like you know should trans women compete in
594240	598800	women's sports that's not a slam dunk it's a complicated question there's a lot in there
598800	606800	you know so i think i think the reason that there has been a slow shift away from broader leftism
606800	611520	is because it accomplished a lot it accomplished a lot of good but we're kind of running out of the
611520	614640	good we're not we haven't completely run out of it but we've but it's definitely starting to run out
614640	621920	of good stuff out of the on on that note like what would you say currently in 2023 today is the
623200	630000	what should progresses in your opinion be putting out there what do you think is their strongest
630000	635520	argument that they have today right what should they be focusing on right now yes uh health care
635520	640720	yeah american needs health care yeah that is that is the big one um oh and you talked about
640720	645440	utopianism and purity spiraling brianna i'll give you a concrete example okay so
646240	650080	you see a lot um a lot of rhetoric on the left they see that they say they're very far left is
650080	653040	you know health care is a human right everything should be free everything should be available to
653040	657040	everyone otherwise you are oppressing people and you're letting people die you're killing people
657040	661680	in fact um in practical terms what we've discovered looking at like the uk's health
661680	665600	care system and france's and canada's health care system what we've discovered is that if you make
665600	670160	everything free you have a shit ton of waste there's and you don't you only have so much
670160	675680	resources to go around there's so many doctors only so much time so if you make everything free
675680	681840	you end up bankrupting your system you can't like it's it's fucked however if you add like a 20
681840	687840	copay to go to the doctors you cut out like 90 of the waste because most people who are just showing
687840	691360	up to like get a day off work and get a doctor's note they're not going to do that because it's
691360	697600	not free anymore right so the the i these numbers are i got them from econoboi like a year ago i
697600	701600	can't pull them up right away but i do remember them as being mostly accurate is that basically
701600	706800	if you add a 20 copay you cut out 90 of your health care waste um in terms of like people
706800	713600	actually like health care waste from from patients so that's that's not ideologically pure
713600	717520	if you're talking about health care as a human right like if that's your value well now it's not
717520	721760	a human right now it costs twenty dollars which means that if somebody doesn't have twenty dollars
721760	725600	if they're too poor and they no one can lend them twenty dollars and they can't get a job
725600	729840	well that person is fucked they're not going to get health care but it also means that you get to
729840	735200	have a health care service for everyone else right so there's certain instances where if you're
735200	740640	ideologically pure you actually end up with worse results than if you compromise and i think health
740640	746160	care is one of those yeah i i certainly agree with that i think that there's that trend across
746160	752480	the board right like we're seeing it right now i think uh really hyperbolically with with with the
752480	759360	israel hamas war and the rhetoric around that you know if you have a stance that is yeah i did to
759360	764400	our wic panel the other night and i said multiple times like i stand with the people of palestine
764400	770720	the human rights abuses towards uh civilians is unconscionable i don't support it our top like
770720	776800	foreign policy in this region should be to you know stop the violence uh but if you don't
776800	783920	leap to the most extreme conclusion there like a one-state solution and like implementing a
783920	790640	democratic utopia there and taking away the borders uh you are just uh you don't have a voice
790640	796480	in the conversation so i agree with you on that yeah dev i do want to say in like tonight i hope
796480	801920	we can just have a respectful back and forth about some of your content i was studying a lot
801920	807360	of your videos which again largely i enjoy they're well produced they're well thought out i think that
807360	814160	this is stuff the left needs an answer for i've noticed though that there's a really big difference
814160	821760	in how you define progressives and is i define progressives depending what the argument is
821760	827920	you're trying to make there's one i was watching and yeah you define progressives in this nice
827920	835600	people that want health care but as like antifa antifa and self-id like trans people you know
835600	841040	they're non-binary and just want to make it up on the fly right so i think like one of the the
841040	846720	things i find sometimes difficult about your content is it it sometimes feels like you have
846720	852560	a conclusion that you want to reach that both sides are equally bad and you kind of reach for
852560	857680	facts that fit that and i don't always think it's an accurate way to to view a situation
859120	864080	well how do you define progressives then what's your view of it i have a much more charitable
864080	870400	point of view on this right uh which is it is i think the highest level progressivism is about
870400	875840	wanting structural um change for solutions like health care is a really good example
876400	882240	um you know i grew up in mississippi so when i think about structural racism in the united states
882240	888720	um i realize there's no policy around the edges that's gonna you know make that society heal from
888720	894960	the the wounds still open today from the civil war so i think at the highest levels like
894960	901680	progressivism is about thinking about big structural policy changes what i you and i
901680	908240	i think agree on is that there's a real tendency especially online to reformat to mean this
908240	913920	extremely online kind of argument that tends towards a purity spiral which is not helpful
918240	925280	that's true but it is um it's not just online but i think it it comes out online because it's it's
925280	931280	so easy right i think you know twitter is no longer 240 characters or whatever it was but
931280	935840	it was for a very long time and i think that promoted a certain type of very uh very short
935840	940960	thinking where you could you have to fit it into a very small box and people did that for a decade
940960	944720	and now we have a bunch of short thinkers if that makes sense especially if you're like like a
944720	948400	twitter addict or you're a journalist or something i think i think twitter ruined a lot of people's
948400	955600	brains i think that's part of it yeah um but but the bigger the bigger problem i think i'm gonna
955600	961040	have to i'm gonna have to do a bit of philosophizing unfortunately go ahead which i i did i did with
961040	968560	the carl max debate as well just to explain a few things so there's um there's a a leftist
968560	975440	philosopher named herbert marcus and he came up with this idea and he it's called it's not called
975440	980160	the march of progress but we'll just use march of progress as a shorthand and the idea basically
980160	983680	is that if you have and he thought this is a good thing he was promoting this i don't think it's a
983680	990720	good thing if you have a movement that is based on change and then you kind of universalize that
991200	996720	so so that it's it simply pursues change it inevitably radicalizes and drives off a cliff
996720	1003200	it has to because it's not it's not aiming at a goal it's aiming at change itself so it's like
1003200	1008160	if you say i want to change to do xyz that's one thing but if you're saying i want to change for
1008160	1013920	changes sake then that's where the utopianism comes from and the purity spiraling and he
1013920	1019200	outlined this all in a book called repressive tolerance where the idea is that tolerance in
1019200	1027200	his view had to repress um people who weren't tolerant right well this is where i think i would
1027200	1033840	like one of the reasons the way like my views on what women are facing in america have not
1033840	1040240	changed since gamergate what has changed radically is the way i go about trying to
1040240	1046800	like affect that change right because i agree with you like at some point um you know we turned
1046800	1053920	a corner in how we are talking about what women face in american society and we stopped talking
1053920	1059360	about policies and we started talking more about an aesthetic where if you had the right
1059920	1066880	like points of view and the expanded feminism to mean you know body shaming and you know this this
1066880	1074080	this very wide gamut of related struggles where you had to kind of identify with all of these
1074080	1081520	values and then eventually hopefully you could talk about the policy um i think this is where
1081520	1087920	feminism really fucked up frankly in the gamergate era if i could do anything and go relive those
1087920	1093440	years over again i would have gotten off of twitter and i would have used the political
1093440	1099680	capital i had in that moment to push microsoft push activision to like change their internal
1099680	1107280	hiring processes right um and and i think that we've really gotten to a point where
1107280	1114320	feminism as a force is not going to be effective until we take a step back and go hold on what are
1114320	1120080	the issues we need to be thinking about uh child care is completely unaffordable women have been
1120080	1125280	run out of the workforce post-covid we're not really seeing an investment in that until we
1125280	1130800	look at these kind of bigger structural issues i don't see us like becoming relevant force in
1130800	1138400	politics again one thing that i noticed in your answers here from both of you right
1138400	1147120	um when uh dev asked you what is progressivism what who is progressive etc uh and then also
1147120	1153200	from dev's uh philosophizing there i think i've kind of had a a bit of a eureka moment and bear
1153200	1164080	with me right um in my mind woo right progressivism from your uh definition what you gave to me
1164080	1171840	is progress towards a goal right but it should be it is not but what but what a lot of progressives
1171840	1177440	and what i've seen this argument online before right is that we are going to progress for
1177520	1183200	progress's sake like we are going to move forward right regardless of where that is we are going to
1183200	1187520	move forward we have to move past capitalism we have to move past these things we have to move
1187520	1194080	forward right and i think that um sometimes at least in the sfo videos i've seen that is the
1194880	1202480	that is the uh what progressives are painted as and i don't think those that's that's a fair
1203040	1209200	characterization dev right i think that like yes there's some of that um and i think that's mostly
1209200	1215680	online stuff but i do think that plenty of progressives plenty of people who who do identify
1215680	1221840	as progressives are towards specific goals um does that make sense how am i off my rocker here
1222720	1227680	that does make sense but i'm not sure it's entirely accurate i mean there's there's some
1227680	1232720	accuracy there i think but considering how much blowback you've been receiving recently brianne
1232720	1238560	you have to know that there's definitely not just a small radical online fringe but a significant
1238560	1246400	number of people who now believe this way yeah i i completely agree uh and i've you know we've
1246400	1251680	talked about this privately in dms i don't mind sharing it here but you know i i personally
1251680	1257840	believe that the left is just 10 years behind the right as far as being radicalized on the internet
1257840	1264320	right i think a lot of the same tendencies we see in the tea party uh have now come to our own
1264320	1270160	doorstep um i think this version of the democratic party unfortunately would be very susceptible to
1270720	1277600	uh you know a left-wing donald trump if a figure like that came along so i i agree with you i think
1277600	1283520	there's time to stop it and you know wick one of the reasons i consider you a good friend at this
1283520	1290880	point is i think i think we have i have a different i think the degree to which i think women are not
1290880	1295120	getting a fair shake in society is a little different than yours i think we have a different
1295120	1302000	appraisal there but directionally i think we both see this torrent of crazy on both sides and we're
1302000	1307040	taking a step and saying this needs to be about policy we've got to calm this down and we've got
1307040	1312080	to learn to talk to each other so we can have a functioning democracy you know i very much agree
1312080	1318400	with you about that so does that make sense to you dev i think so yeah yeah um to go back to what you
1318400	1323520	were saying earlier you mentioned that um basically progressives have been making less progress as the
1323520	1327600	radicalizations happened right yeah um you probably don't agree with my characterization of this but
1327600	1335280	i'm going to give it anyway please um i think that there was a lot of um of things that needed to be
1335280	1339360	fixed and the feminists fixed a lot of them not all of them but they fixed a lot of them over
1339360	1345280	let's say the past 100 years or so there's been a lot of improvement um and then as the the number
1345280	1353040	of things to fix began to dry up you started to see them focus on on small things right micro
1353040	1357120	aggressions body shaming like you mentioned you know think things that weren't nearly as important
1357120	1363120	as should women be allowed to hold jobs and vote you know much smaller things and then as they
1363120	1369120	focused on the smaller things um they radicalized they became a lot more crazy looking to the normies
1369920	1376400	and then while they were in that that echo chamber they started taking big l's like with roe v wade
1376400	1383600	yeah and and like the rollback of lgbt acceptance so i think i think there's been this um this ebb
1383600	1389840	and flow where as the left the broader left has been accomplishing goals they've run out of goals
1389840	1394400	to accomplish and which has radicalized them then they became crazy then they started rolling back
1394400	1398160	they started losing all those goals they had accomplished so i understand that these things
1398160	1403200	happened at the same time dad but my question to you would be like are and i want you to be
1403200	1409120	clear here are you blaming that um that niche kind of focus that the left has had on the micro
1409120	1415360	aggressions and the small things as to why they lost roe v wade and as to why they've taken big
1415360	1421120	l's when it comes to lgbtq processes of protections and stuff is that are you are you
1421120	1426640	implying that there is a causation factor there i think there partially is yes i mean obviously
1426640	1430480	another part of it is that they have political opponents who want to roll those things back and
1430480	1435440	they took that opportunity right but they they made themselves weak they gave them the opening
1435440	1441680	you know i i hear what you're saying and i'm not going to deny there's a lot of that that's going
1441680	1448400	on i i definitely think so i i think and you talked about this in your video about the purity
1448400	1452960	spiral right uh which is excellent i hope we can leave that in the show notes and people will check
1452960	1458240	it out i think if you're on the left thank you very much dev has a very good analysis of a real
1458240	1465600	problem that we have um but even in your own video you talk about how this is advantageous for us to
1466240	1472560	build a coalition but in the end is kind of a cancer that eats us apart right so i think i
1472560	1478800	think that's exactly what happened right this started with us kind of all getting together
1478800	1483840	and going hey you know we've all noticed that our sexual assault claims are being kind of
1483840	1490160	systematically not being taken seriously i think women across a wide variety of fields look around
1490160	1494480	at the workplace and go you know what i have a lot of trouble being taken seriously and being
1494480	1500240	heard on my own teams right or as soon as i have a child i've noticed that my my my job is very
1500240	1506000	eager to show me a door right this is a set of problems that we've certainly not solved and we're
1506000	1515040	nowhere near solving what i think has happened is i think online is a trap particularly for people
1515040	1520880	you know i want to be really clear i fell into this trap i i look back at my own congressional
1520880	1527200	run and i think if i understood the things i do today i think i would have had a much better shot
1527200	1534800	of winning because what i can look back and see really clearly was online was pushing me to take
1534800	1541280	this this leftmost view on literally everything you know sex work not accepting you know money
1541280	1549280	from xyz and really focusing on the superficial when what i needed to be doing was spending a lot
1549280	1554160	more time in my district and talking about the policies like directly affecting their lives and
1554160	1561120	that's something i would do very differently today online i think is a trap because i think it it
1561120	1567200	gives people this feeling that they're they're making a change and i think it's with the best
1567200	1575360	of intention you know um yeah i'm not uh i'm not like a fat person but i can really imagine that
1576000	1581840	like feeling degraded all the time or feeling the ways that like society doesn't respect you i would
1581840	1586960	imagine there's some anger and some trauma there and i think it probably feels good to talk about
1586960	1593360	that online the problem is somewhere along the line like the problem is with online culture
1593360	1600480	there's no point where we pause and say okay we need to make it so um you know people that are
1600480	1608080	larger can access trains and planes with a little bit more dignity right there's not a public policy
1608080	1614480	component that we're pushing for as much as the fringe left loves to shit on liberals i do think
1614480	1619520	this is something structurally liberals are better at than progressives kind of forming coalitions
1619520	1627920	and trying to get specific policies passed well insofar as the fat thing is concerned as a fat guy
1628720	1632720	i'm quite how dare you speak over one of the oppressed classes
1632720	1641200	briano we have a fat man i apologize okay i i will say that like being fat's just unhealthy
1641200	1646160	and i think rather than like it it is better to promote public health than it is to promote
1646160	1651040	you know accommodating people being fat i think we want people to lose weight not feel comfortable
1651040	1657360	being being fat if that if that makes sense yeah i agree with that um but i also yeah this is
1657360	1662560	something i saw like when i was running for office i do think that there are situations where i don't
1662560	1668240	think it would kill airlines to have a few larger seats that are given for priority for people that
1668240	1674960	physically can't fit in those seats that doesn't seem crazy to me right um maybe maybe the main the
1674960	1681040	fat thing is a bad example there are any number of like reasonable public policy things we could
1681040	1687680	be focused on and we just don't because the conversation is so much about uh like online
1687680	1693520	purity here's a really good example uh the trans debate you know if you put me in charge tomorrow
1693520	1700000	of like talking about the the trans public policy um you know issue i would try to find something
1700000	1705920	very similar to gay marriage where like you're focused on a single public policy position with
1705920	1712480	a broad possible range of support and i would make that like the rights of trans children to
1712480	1720080	attend public school um but instead it gets into like this more esoteric thing and this more
1720080	1726720	esoteric thing which often i agree with but i also understand how it's not ever going to be a
1726720	1732800	popular public policy position and i think all of this is a trap i think if we're serious about
1732800	1738640	things like health care and trans dignity and women's rights we've got to come up with a new
1738640	1745520	strategy because any honest look at where the progressive movement is today you have to admit
1745520	1753120	we have less cultural power today than we did a decade ago to you brianna right yeah you say this
1753680	1761280	but the implications are are weird at that if the online is a trap does that not at least
1761280	1768640	imply or infer that we should simply seed the field leave online to be do online things right
1768640	1773600	and just leave it alone i think you and i could both agree and i think sfo might back us up that
1773600	1780080	the online and how that uh plays out does have real world implications it does impact not only
1780080	1785200	policy right but people's individuals lives as well like there are countless examples that we
1785200	1791440	can point to of people being harassed stalked etc and also of policies that have been either
1791440	1797440	implemented because of discourse that has started online or prevented from going through and or uh
1799360	1805920	swift voted because of uh that's an old term uh because of online discourse right um
1807280	1814320	like if online's a trap it's not a trap we can avoid is it i i've talked so much def go ahead
1816080	1820880	i hmm i don't know how to how to answer that actually because i had a brainwave about a
1820880	1825440	previous thing you were saying brianna and that was occupying my head i'm sorry wick no it's okay
1825440	1829600	do your brainwave thing we can ignore wick we can we can just play as video games and make money off
1831200	1836000	i will say wick i will say that like um i don't think you can ignore the online space
1836000	1839760	because you have uh people who are more left-leaning complaining about harassment
1839760	1844080	all the time and there's there's some faked harassment but there's a lot of real harassment
1844080	1847120	but then you also have people on the right who complain about getting cancelled and that
1847120	1850560	definitely happens too people have lost their jobs they've been de-banked they've had their
1851200	1855440	social media shut down i'm gonna make a prediction for you there's going to be a left-wing
1855440	1861120	resurgence in believing in cancel culture after uh after a month or two right like i think in the
1861120	1866800	next couple months we're gonna we're gonna hear a you and cry of people decrying people losing
1866800	1872080	their jobs for their political opinions i am guaranteeing that but go ahead yeah yeah yeah
1872080	1879360	absolutely i know um for example kraut if you know kraut and t he recently said that in germany
1879360	1883360	a whole bunch of migrants who had showed up from the middle east and now there's things
1883360	1887680	stuff about israel they're getting they're getting deported because germany is very strict with its
1887680	1892160	its jewish laws for obvious reasons right so there's a whole bunch of people who are just
1892160	1896960	getting kicked out of germany now and so i do think there's going to be some sort of a backlash
1896960	1902160	with people who are going very mask off on these on the israel-palestine situation and losing their
1902160	1907040	jobs and suddenly it'll be like you can't cancel people over over your political beliefs and it's
1907040	1910960	like well listen that's been happening for for years now to people who are right-leaning so
1911840	1917040	i like i don't want anyone canceled either like either side right but if these are the rules of
1917040	1925200	the game this is how it has to be you know i mean i i i don't have an issue with someone
1925840	1932480	losing i i i don't think i have the same position over what y'all do i mean dev you have a video
1932480	1938720	where you talk about uh the woman uh with the wig pulling right and how you didn't support uh
1938720	1944160	i think the name of the video is uh what is it cancel culture is totalitarian or something like
1944160	1950400	that and you're talking about this woman that basically uh this drunk white guy uh sees her
1950400	1956560	on the street tries to pull her wig off uh in a really violent way clearly hurts her and uh she
1956560	1961520	happens to film it and the guy ends up fired you're talking how you you don't support that
1961520	1968160	um i actually don't really have a problem with that necessarily what i do have a problem with is
1968800	1975040	and this is where i expect to get yelled at after this show is i have been against a certain set of
1975040	1982320	tactics from the gamer gate era right i think it is wrong to dox people i think it's wrong to go
1982320	1987920	through everything they've ever said publicly or privately and then try to use that to destroy
1987920	1993840	their reputation i think death threats rape threats all that stuff should just be off the table
1993840	2001200	right um and i want to be really honest and say that a decade ago i think gamer gate was doing
2001200	2005840	that and i would imagine all three of us would probably agree today the people i personally see
2005840	2014080	doing this the most are my own side and it just seems so crazy hypocritical of me that we decried
2014080	2020240	all these tactics and now we've just embraced them as our core strategy does does that kind of make
2020240	2028160	sense yep yep that's um uh fuck what was his name was it saw linsky i don't know the guy who wrote
2028160	2032960	rules for radicals you wrote this book basically outlining what radical movements should do to take
2032960	2038480	power and one of them one of the rules is just be as hypocritical as possible yeah do do the
2038480	2042960	underhanded stuff and also accuse your opponents of doing it you know right so it's this is kind
2042960	2050560	of how radical movements go as they radicalize but i mean you can't this is where i'm really torn a
2050560	2057120	lot of the time because i do agree with the political the stated political goals of the
2057120	2063600	progressive movement right uh you know i do want more acceptance for trans people i do want things
2063600	2067920	to be better for women i do you know i've been on a wick panel before talking about my belief in
2067920	2072000	like structural reparations for you know black people i think it's the only way we can move
2072000	2077440	forward from the pain of the civil war so when it comes to a lot of these policies i'm right there
2077440	2084480	on board where i'm feeling increasingly homeless is there is a standard i try to hold myself to
2084480	2091760	professionally and how i behave and i just see a lot of my own side engaged in tactics it just
2091760	2096880	i i don't know how to say it other than they feel evil to me to both of you and this is a very good
2096880	2101120	question because i think we've both acknowledged or all of us have acknowledged that it's worse
2101120	2106720	now right than it was 10 years ago it's worse value was 10 15 years ago um again i'm i'm a
2106720	2113680	little older myself right and i was i was active online in the early 2000s and things like that
2114480	2117840	very different very different environment for better or worse right there there's some things
2117840	2123840	i don't want back from those days um however you don't want the xbox live chats back look
2125040	2131280	we had some uh we had some fun times but those times are behind us um yeah uh we have grown up
2131280	2139280	and grown out of those things um but i will ask well should we and how do we do so and that's my
2139280	2144880	question is because it's it's very easy to get black pilled on this like these doxing
2144880	2150720	tactics these um these just doubling down taxes this constant harassment it's been shown to work
2150720	2156480	right it's been shown to be effective in getting the people you don't want to to be around not be
2156480	2161600	around anymore it hasn't worked when it came to combating our ideas getting policies passed any
2161600	2167840	of that but it's worked for what i think people really like and that's hurting others um so how
2167840	2175840	do we how do we get passes can't we get passes is it is there a way to stop this spiral as i
2175840	2181680	guess you'd call it or this uh this constant wave of tit for tat of reciprocal radicalization of
2181680	2185520	if you use those tactics we're going to use those tactics 10 times as hard etc etc
2185520	2190080	uh what what do we think i want dev to go first on this one and then i'll let you go
2191920	2196160	oh man how do you how do you fix the problem that's uh that's a very if we're going to talk
2196160	2202240	about the problem we gotta talk about how to fix it right yeah yeah um you have to
2203840	2208720	it's it's a tall order not everyone's gonna be able to do it you have to be able to understand
2208720	2213680	your your opponent's arguments all right you have to understand that like when a conservative
2214240	2218640	you know expresses some sort of anti-trans opinion he doesn't actually want to kill all
2218640	2223440	trans people and how you know how have the streets run red with the blood of trans people and
2223440	2228480	outlaw no he's generally scared for his kids right and now you can think that it's wrong
2228480	2232400	for him to be scared for his kids in that way and there's some good evidence that he probably
2232400	2239600	is wrong but it's not it's not coming from a place of of evil right and there's also there's
2239600	2243520	obviously inverted situations as well where like right wingers do not understand leftist point of
2243520	2250160	views leftists don't understand right wing point of views um basically if you can't steal man your
2250160	2254640	opponent's arguments you're you're not going to be able to sympathize with them when they
2254640	2257040	have an emotional reaction to something that they think is bad
2260160	2266080	so being able to steal men or wanting to steal but the problem is dev no one wants to do that
2266720	2273520	i well i can't make them i mean so so there's this idea um like pre-internet you watch what was on
2273520	2278400	tv maybe you could like rent a movie but like you watch what was on tv i would have never grown to
2278400	2285280	love um to love martial arts films if i didn't watch them at 3 a.m by like sneaking downstairs
2285280	2291600	as a kid right it was the only thing on um and i i had i think from 16 to 18 i had an
2291600	2295440	insomnia so i couldn't sleep and i was just staying up all night watching these martial arts films
2295440	2302160	because that's all i could do right um it's one of those things where as technological
2302160	2308160	advancement has increased and we have more access to netflix for example we never have
2308160	2311760	to be exposed to anything we don't like ever again which is nice because we don't want to
2311760	2315120	interact with things that we hate but also it means that we never actually discover anything new
2315840	2321920	so if you take that principle you apply it to political echo chambers people don't watch videos
2321920	2326480	or read books or entertain ideas from other political camps because they don't have to anymore
2326480	2330960	you know if you're a leftist you can go on youtube and watch an infinite amount of leftist content
2330960	2335840	and never be exposed to a right-wing idea and same same the other way around right there's
2336560	2339920	there's it's it sounds very strange but there's like there's too much access
2340480	2346880	and you know the the um the white pillar in me wants to say that well no people can be trusted
2346880	2353280	to diversify their their their media intake and understand what other people think and there are
2353280	2358960	some people who have for sure but it seems like most people just aren't doing it it's uh i think
2358960	2366240	that's oh i think that's go ahead no no i was just gonna say yeah like i know that you know
2366240	2373200	i've told you this in dms i am better at my job because i watch your videos and i do think because
2373200	2382080	you have such a salient uh brutal fair critique of the left i think it makes me stronger to watch
2382080	2388240	that critique and figure out what the answer is right so i agree with you that uh this tendency
2388240	2394720	for all of us to never listen to something on the other side it makes us weak it makes us unable to
2394720	2402000	function um and one of the reasons i really respect uh destiny a lot is i think more than
2402000	2407680	anyone else out there yeah look let's be clear he makes a lot of sweaty gamer comments he can
2407680	2413040	certainly tend towards being hyperbolic uh but i also think one of the good things he does is he
2413040	2420320	teaches people how to think i think when people make claims uh he really encourages his audience
2420320	2426000	to look through that to think through it uh before responding and to really really do your research
2426000	2433120	before having really strong opinions um i think that's a really good example um one of the things
2433120	2440720	i think has really really changed over my lifetime is this democratization of information i'm just
2440720	2447200	barely old enough to remember when you could get uh your news and it had to be on either cable or
2447200	2452320	the printed newspaper that came to your house every single day and that had a lot of downsides
2452320	2458480	you know you didn't hear about a lot of stories about gay people in uh that time period you know
2458480	2464240	the the the makeup of the newsrooms had huge implications for how things were covered which
2464240	2469360	is why i think we can look at public policy and the conversations we are not having about issues
2469360	2475440	like structural racism back in the 90s and see how simple they were compared to today that is a
2475440	2482720	bad thing but something was really good about that that i think is really really um under acknowledged
2482720	2490720	today is in the newspaper and cable news era of public information that did go through someone
2490720	2497600	at the top that was mature that was thoughtful that generally took some time to make sure the
2497600	2506720	stuff there was mostly accurate and did represent both sides um today we have no incentives for
2506720	2513760	any of that and i think we're much weaker as a society i think a direct reason we're seeing such
2513760	2522720	a stupid analysis on um on foreign policy issues today is we have now two generation of americans
2522720	2528160	they've never heard any position other than america is bad and our foreign policy is always
2528160	2532720	wrong and the world is a little bit more complicated than that even though we've made
2532720	2540560	plenty of foreign policy mistakes so i think that a really important thing is for america to take
2540560	2547600	more of a role in thinking about how this information landscape is influencing us right
2547600	2552880	we've got to protect free speech we've got to protect open expression but i also think we've
2552880	2558240	lost control the way people get their information to a mob and i don't think it's serving our
2558240	2566160	country well yeah so you're getting at like the post-truth era yeah if you know the post-modern
2566160	2573280	post-truth era yeah so it's it's like well can you trust cnn well i mean maybe you know they're
2573280	2576480	a decently big institution there's a lot of moving parts lots of people there but like
2576480	2580160	what if they're all compromised right well can you trust fox well maybe not like these are big
2580160	2583440	corporations and if you don't trust corporations because they're corporate you know maybe you want
2583440	2587520	to go somewhere else you know do you trust tim pool or do you trust like some some smaller site
2587520	2591840	do you trust some really fringe one like zero hedge or something because there's there's
2591840	2595920	utility and looking at the small guys too because they don't have corporate interests but they but
2595920	2599440	now they have like personal interests and they're and they're probably more radical than the
2599440	2605920	mainstream guys like anything can be tainted with some form of bias you know any company
2605920	2610080	any individual any institution so who do you trust and then you get to a point where it's
2610080	2615760	like well do you trust anything at all like i've i i've never been to antarctica so how do i know
2615760	2620400	that it actually exists right like it could be an entire like a huge psyop the entire world's
2620400	2625200	playing on me you can you can go down a rabbit hole joke about this but there are some people
2625200	2633040	there's a growing well it's not growing that fast but there is a portion of people who do just
2633600	2640880	don't trust anything any institution is suspect any fact is suspect look at the denialism that
2640880	2647840	has come out after october 7th of the things that everyone saw on video and suddenly there's
2647840	2653200	there's people with millions of followers with hundreds of thousands of likes on their shot shit
2653200	2659040	just making shit up and saying it and uh it gets more likes than the truth right and
2659920	2666160	yeah how do you how do you fix that because brianna woo like uh respectfully like there were
2666160	2671360	a lot of problems back when we had so much gatekeeping right like there's it held us back
2671360	2678560	so much and i don't know if we want or can go back to that style of having some kind of um
2679440	2686240	person on the top a uh uh some elite deciding what we can and can't like what i don't want
2686240	2693600	that right and that's not why i'm advocating i'm saying that i'm saying that every system has
2693600	2699680	upsides and downsides right a really big upside that system is there was an editor involved and
2699680	2704480	i think the fact that editor is no longer involved today is a real downside for how we are getting
2704480	2713920	information so you know like i think i think the fact that all of these algorithms exist to
2713920	2719200	addict you like they literally keep psychologists on staff to figure out how to addict you
2719840	2724800	i i don't have an immediate answer for this but i wonder if there's a role for us to take a more
2724800	2734080	active um in a regulatory position in asking how is so much social media affecting people's brains
2734080	2740720	right uh when the facebook whistleblower came out you know she was giving all kinds of instances
2740720	2746080	from facebook's own internal studies about what instagram is doing to an entire generation of
2746080	2750560	young women's brains and it's it's terrible it's upping their suicidality it's destroying their
2750560	2756960	body image it's leading to mental health issues i mean it's just across the board it's really really
2756960	2763840	bad and i just i'm not gonna tell you i have easy answers for this right now because all of these
2763840	2770320	problems are multi-factorial but i do think the fact that we've just basically seeded all of this
2770800	2776160	we've said we're not gonna take any role in this whatsoever i do think that's adding to the the
2776160	2782720	the instability that is really putting democracy at risk yeah you see there's like a there's another
2783440	2786720	i i mostly agree with you but there's a different way to kind of phrase it right
2787520	2792720	the downside of democratization is that people are generally retarded right and that's that's
2792720	2799360	just that's just how it is right you know man i okay i remember during the height of let's say
2799360	2803760	covid paranoia not to imply that covid wasn't real or anything i'm not going down that rabbit hole
2803760	2807600	okay i was about to say come on man i'm trying to keep my content monetized like
2808640	2815200	no no no but like there were people i remember some one person specifically said you need to
2815200	2820480	respect democracy and trust the experts and i'm like hold on those are two completely opposing
2820480	2826560	values because an expert opinion is specifically non-democratic it's the opinion of a learned
2826560	2832640	minority that is informing the unlearned majority right so when you have democratization you do
2832640	2838400	hear from more voices and that can be a good thing but also like special specialization is like is
2838400	2843040	like i don't know what the word is there there's something that is anti-democratic but also
2843040	2849920	necessary in society in order to actually try to ascertain what the truth is the the only issue is
2849920	2855760	like how can you trust that right it's we are in a quagmire like i have no solutions to this problem
2856320	2862960	i just know that at least on a local scale like within your own personal life if you do your best
2862960	2868320	to tell the truth you can make things at least somewhat better better for you and better for
2868320	2872720	people around you you know if you have a platform better for those who listen in on your platform if
2872720	2878240	you're allowed to be honest yes but i think one of the major problems with these platforms are
2878240	2882160	people are not allowed to be honest can we look can we talk about for a moment right i know this
2882160	2890880	is maybe off topic but this is bothering me ethan klein and hamas pipe oh i guess not uh give me a
2890880	2903280	second hopefully she ran away soon um i didn't kick her out gang wonder if she uh i hope her
2903280	2911280	internet's okay um we'll give it a second um in the meantime uh gang if you're enjoying this
2911280	2915920	content uh hit that like button hit that subscribe button uh feel free to follow me on twitch or
2915920	2922080	kick if you're watching me through those things hit those uh hit uh hit the sub button um throw
2922080	2927440	bits at me uh give me subs throw super chats i'll read one super chat now from testicle johnson for
2927440	2933200	five dollars i think all the chicks i think all chicks in video games should have thin
2933200	2937200	wastes and massive tits and all the dude should have five percent body fat everyone should feel
2937200	2942560	bad ten dollars from zephyr hash to say at dev i get what you're saying but how long are we
2942560	2946320	supposed to wait and how much energy are we supposed to put into making sure everyone
2946320	2951440	understands our point of view specific specifically when time is of the essence
2951440	2958480	and also welcome back brianne hi uh my computer is restarting uh so i'm on my phone so sorry
2958480	2964080	no it's okay do your thing uh let's get a scheduled windows update that got you i have no
2964080	2971040	ideas well i'm just glad you're back and we were wondering if uh if finally the leftist mob had
2971040	2976080	come for you right like that this was your time and we were going to be like hearing news reports
2976080	2981200	or something of suddenly sunday uh found your location and his mob descended upon you i don't
2981200	2987200	know right uh yeah wick i've heard that you've you've had a beef with president sunday recently
2987440	2994800	what's that all about um he made some uh he keeps making shit up and going after people um he told
2994800	3003200	aristocracy that she needed to calm down after october 7th and made some very very um untoward
3003200	3009440	comments i called him out on that and here we are um there there are some people like i will
3009440	3012640	talk with pretty much anyone you know i'll talk with very far left people i'll talk with very
3012640	3016480	far right people um the people i won't talk with are the people who actually take it offline
3016480	3022400	right so i'll never speak uh okay i'll never speak to president sunday i'll never speak to
3022400	3027840	uh ethan ralph i'll never speak nick fuentes people who actually try to like get get your
3027840	3032080	get your stuff fucked up i will never talk to those people because that's that's too far for
3032080	3036800	me well i had a i had a gentleman um i this wasn't sunday to be clear it was someone else i know who
3036800	3042960	it was um recently um basically told me he's going to try to get my channel taken away uh he got me a
3042960	3050240	warning um uh on twitch the other day because i unfortunately forgot that uh one of my guests was
3050240	3058080	banned from twitch and uh but they they remembered and so i took a ding from that but yeah there are
3058080	3063040	people who will just sit on my shit wait for me to break toss and it is what it is yep same here
3063600	3070640	i mean this is really i think this is really a very serious problem where um one of the things
3070640	3077600	i have really found recently is i've i've really really enjoyed spending more time uh reaching out
3077600	3083280	and talking to people in the right wing right like i debated uh john doyle at the the university
3083280	3089120	of south carolina just a couple of days ago i did tim pool show uh you know dev i know i speak for
3089120	3093520	myself but i'm really enjoying speaking with you tonight you know uh despite you know our history
3093520	3098480	of gamergate and i i just i don't know we're talking about gamergate eventually the chat
3099360	3106480	we will get to that but before we do we'll finish we'll finish my point yeah go ahead what i was
3106480	3114160	going to say is i don't know when we got so afraid to actually talk about ideas right um it really
3114160	3122560	feels like the left our top answer for stuff nowadays is to um just refuse to engage with
3122560	3130320	anything that's unpleasant right and it's not i understand that often there's some ideas that
3130320	3136800	just are not worth responding to um like i think we would want to take the the like a policy
3136800	3142560	proposal of a holocaust in the united states uh seriously or give that air time but for a lot of
3142560	3148560	the stuff we talk about um i i think it's so counterproductive the way we won't engage it on
3148560	3155440	its merits just before the show uh i was watching ethan and hasan debate and ethan really having
3155440	3161920	some very salient points about why one state solution would not work for israel right and uh
3161920	3168240	just hasan would not engage with that in any honest way that's a that that that sticks on the
3168240	3171920	point that i wanted to bring up before you had your computer issues uh first of all your camera
3171920	3177520	isn't up so if uh i don't know oh apologize yeah i just didn't know you know um
3179840	3185840	let's talk about ethan and asan right because dev made the point that we need to be improve our uh
3185840	3191520	improve our areas of the internet by being honest ourselves so that and so my my question on this
3191520	3198000	my uh tack on this is i don't know if we are going to be allowed to do that right and i think the way
3198000	3203760	that ethan klein has been treated uh over his what is this the third fourth discussion he's
3203760	3212720	had with us on over all this right to see the vitriol my timeline has put on ethan for simply
3213680	3219760	being upset that a bunch of people like for having pretty normie takes right you can say they're
3219760	3225840	wrong or whatever but he's just being honest like you can't say that this guy's lying about this he's
3225840	3232480	being honest and to see the way that he is just being excoriated that he is losing respect
3232480	3238480	viewership etc to be being raked over the coals he was forced to apologize right to someone who
3238480	3245920	had offended him like uh it's it's it's wild to me and i don't see it getting better i think this is
3245920	3252960	kind of at least for the the foreseeable future the new norm you are not allowed to be honest
3252960	3258720	because if you are that platform or that space you have will be taken from you um what do you
3258720	3266000	think well kind of like like sargon's still around right he's certainly not on the left
3266000	3270720	he's something further to write than me he thinks i'm a communist for example which i'm not obviously
3270720	3274560	but he's he's he's but like we're still good friends though even though if you have political
3274560	3280400	differences we're still we're still pals um but he still has he's like he exists outside of the
3280400	3285360	leftist internet bubble and he still exists you know he he opened his uh his think tank and he
3285360	3289920	has like a dozen employees and he's doing his thing so there's definitely ways for you to
3290720	3296560	exist outside of like internet leftism i think i think you can still you can still you know speak
3296560	3302000	the truth if you're not in that bubble it's hard for people who are though because you know i've
3302000	3305840	seen a lot of people who are you know they're like center left you know like someone like stardust
3305840	3310080	right get into lots of trouble with some people for for speaking out against the far left
3310720	3318880	um hmm i i have a very black-pilled opinion on this oh no i hope maybe i can be white-pilled
3318880	3328880	on it one day but i think i think there's this view i think there's this view on the left
3328880	3335040	that because so much of of academia is leftist that the right just has no worthwhile ideas to
3335040	3339520	consider which isn't true there there's there's there's some decent right-wing literature out
3339520	3343680	there for sure that's worth reading i'm going to put a pin in that because i want to ask who
3343680	3351200	who what's the best right-wing opinion out there right now well so one of the things i you know i
3351200	3357520	was very very young uh i had to get over my you know religious right mississippi indoctrination
3357520	3362720	and i look back on that actually and see it as my superpower there are a lot of things uh that i
3362720	3368640	took from that that i think are very advantageous in my professional career um i think that the
3368640	3376480	right has some ideas about personal responsibility that are just just true they they are like um a
3376480	3380560	responsibility to solve your own problems i'll give you a really concrete example when it comes
3380560	3386560	to drug addiction one of the things like i just celebrated 20 years this is bryony right you have
3386560	3393920	noticed when you talk to left-wing friends their top um thing they suggest on this is not judging
3393920	3400240	let's get aa out of the mix because they are uh you know they're a non-secular organization all
3400240	3406800	of this and i can tell you the the thing that is most helpful for getting over a drug addiction
3406800	3413920	is accountability structure standards and frankly really harsh consequences when you fail
3414560	3420080	you know this is the reason drug courts are so effective right so i think that the right does
3420080	3425680	have some really common sense ideas that make less sense about how to get to where you want
3425680	3430880	to go in life sorry for the interruption dev i just i wanted to see what we would have to say
3430880	3439280	on that but carry on please right wing ideas the part okay you know where you're at um you you just
3439280	3445840	mentioned something about um getting away from aa right okay right and earlier you mentioned
3445840	3451280	refusing to engage with unpleasantness yeah something yeah okay so there's something i've
3451280	3456160	been i've been thinking about and and i had a conversation with sitch like six months ago that
3456160	3460880	kind of sparked this idea in me and i've really been going over um wick i know that you know about
3460880	3467840	height moral foundations yes um rihanna do you know about i don't i apologize okay it's a
3467840	3472560	psychology thing um jonathan hight did did research into the psychology of morality
3472560	3477280	and he basically pointed out that there's there's six dimensions across which humans
3477280	3481360	judge things to be moral or immoral and i just pull up i'll just pull up here real quick
3484160	3491360	okay that's uh care and harm fairness and cheating loyalty and betrayal authority and
3491360	3498560	subversion sanctity and degradation liberty and oppression and what he found with his research
3498560	3506880	is that you have certain political views map onto certain um certain moral foundations which
3506880	3513360	are more more or less important to the individual and also certain personality types so when you
3513360	3518000	have what what you found is that when you talk to someone who's very very progressive they tend to
3518000	3525280	basically only to care about care and harm right so maximizing care avoiding harm can you name the
3525280	3531680	other four really quickly so i can contrast that in my mind um it's care harm fairness cheating
3532480	3541280	loyalty betrayal authority subversion sanctity degradation liberty oppression and those are the
3541280	3548960	six would uh i mean i mean we can see the liberty oppression right the oppressor what's the
3548960	3554320	difference between liberty impression and oppressor oppressed dynamic because the left is famous for
3554320	3559840	oppressor oppressed dynamics internal well in his research he found that socialists do tend to
3559840	3567040	value liberty and oppression progressives value it less than socialists um okay yeah but also like
3567040	3573040	like um uh fascists value authority overwhelmingly other than the other than the other five um you
3573040	3579200	find that conservatives tend to value loyalty more um religious people tend to value sanctity more
3579200	3584000	and progressives tend to value care and harm more liberals just like normally like central
3584000	3588880	centrist liberals tend to value fairness more right so you you have these different views of
3588880	3595840	morality that map onto different views of politics and i've seen so many very very progressive people
3595840	3600400	talk about like like harm reduction harm reduction is a great example harm reduction is like the
3600400	3605520	let's um let's not be so harsh on people who have drug addictions will give them like safe supplies
3605520	3610480	of heroin as if you ever have such a thing which is a good pro no needle programs do work we have
3610480	3617600	a lot of data about that yeah but like you also don't want to enable someone's addiction you don't
3617600	3623760	want it like like you you do want to have them to not be addicts first and foremost right sure but
3623760	3629840	i mean being out on the street like you know using dirty needles and getting all kinds of terrible
3629840	3635360	diseases it costs the public a ton of money it's not doing the many favors and it's an opportunity
3635760	3641360	to talk about getting them into treatment right that's true that's all true however you know if
3641360	3645840	if you have a different moral way of looking at it you might ask the question well i don't want to
3645840	3653520	be the person who gives a druggie some drugs that would not be obviously yeah yeah so so i agree
3653520	3658160	with you yes yeah so like there's there's different ways to view it right but you know with
3658160	3663520	with harm reduction does come the sense of if we just reduce as much harm as possible because
3663520	3666720	things are so like things are so terrible just just we have to reduce harm reduce harm you know
3666720	3669920	we can't worry about anything else just reduce the harm it's like well you're not building anything
3669920	3674080	virtuous there it's like yeah okay you're reducing harm but you're just like lessening the negative
3674080	3682880	you're not making anything positive if that makes sense so there's because you mentioned um aa and
3682880	3690080	aa has a religious component if you believe that religion is negative a net negative for society
3690160	3697600	then you might have the opinion of well i'm just gonna say fuck aa because it has these other
3697600	3703360	negative things that come along with it because i want i want the perfect answer and right isn't it
3703360	3707680	you know is this reflected just real quick and like the people who are critical of mr base who
3707680	3713120	built 100 wells or cured blindness and a thousand people and say well that's part of it because you
3713120	3719040	haven't fixed the structural issues you've just enabled the structural issues to keep uh to keep
3719040	3724880	going and your charity is actually uh causing long-term harm so yeah is that that's like that
3724880	3729920	that's part of it there's also another aspect of that though um that comes out of um angles
3729920	3735520	writing angles a socialist and marks and angles you know angle angles wrote about how basically
3735520	3742400	charity is evil because it is given at the discretion of the capitalist of the rich person
3742400	3747840	so he can make himself feel good by giving money to solve problems that he caused and it's like
3747840	3752960	well that's just ridiculous but it's like well i don't even agree with that point of view but
3752960	3757600	even if that were the truth it's still good to give the money right like the charity still has
3757600	3762240	its place but but it was his view that like well no the working class deserves the money so if you
3762240	3766320	if if a rich person gives it to them they're doing the bare minimum and you can't you can't give them
3766320	3770560	any sort of positive feedback for that and it's like well that seems almost sociopathic to me
3770560	3774480	can i circle around about something you were talking about because aa is a really good example
3774480	3781360	i think about this feeling of utopianism on the left and how this is so poorly i think it results
3781360	3789120	in really bad public policy so from my perspective my home state of mississippi has no resources
3789120	3794160	almost for drug addiction right i was very fortunate to have a family that could afford
3794160	3801120	to send me to thirty thousand dollar live at the rehab like therapy for you know two months
3801760	3807040	like and paid that out of pocket my god was i lucky about that but most people don't right
3807040	3813120	it's not going to surprise you mississippi does not have uh free for everyone drug and alcohol
3813120	3818960	uh uh treatment programs on the corner they do have a lot of churches that will lend space for
3818960	3826160	people so aa has a principle where you don't have to make god your higher power you can make aa
3826160	3830720	your higher power you can make spiritualism your higher power doesn't matter what you want to make
3831200	3838160	there are secular ways to do that and they are literally i see my own side talking about aa
3838160	3844880	as if this utopian let's make everything secular that itself is the goal the goal is not give
3844880	3852080	people that are addicted to drugs and alcohol a path to treatment and sobriety the goal is to be
3852080	3858800	morally pure and it's just so counterproductive i know more people that got sober from aa than i
3858800	3865120	do from rehab matthew perry in his book before he died have wonderful things to say about aa and i
3865120	3872000	just this is just this tendency of of having to have a perfect solution that i don't think is
3872000	3878080	resulting in good public policy yeah yeah and i think that that comes from heights moral
3878080	3882960	foundations right so i mean it's it's it's on wikipedia it's a pretty well-known idea if you
3882960	3887360	want to look at it in depth but basically like when you have two different people with two
3887360	3892320	different moral foundations you know one of them cares about care harm the other one cares about
3892320	3895360	you know loyalty betrayal so that would be like a progressive and a conservative
3895920	3900480	you put those two together they're going to view each other as immoral and not because one of them
3900480	3905040	is necessarily right and one is necessarily wrong but because they have different psychology right
3905040	3910480	so so the progressive might say hey you're hurting people with your behavior you should stop that
3910480	3915440	because we should be maximizing for care and the conservative might say you're betraying somebody
3915440	3919360	and we should stop that we should be maximizing for loyalty right so they're going to have
3919360	3923200	different they almost like it's almost like they speak a different moral language when they're
3923200	3928080	oh we do i i don't know if you've ever read this book what is the name of it it's talking about
3928080	3933360	the psychology of republicans and why um they kind of tend towards authoritarianism in ways
3933360	3938880	that the left doesn't but there is there's a like something i think that's really underappreciated
3938880	3944240	on the left is how the the foundation of how conservatives think really starts with this idea
3944240	3951520	of a a father figure in the home whose job it is to protect the family from harm in a lot of of
3951520	3957600	their of terrible ways right and that's making decisions listening providing like that's just
3957600	3963680	kind of the moral foundation of how a lot of conservatives think and i i see so many people
3963680	3968960	on my own side sneering at that but i think they're really out of touch with how a large part
3968960	3974240	of the country uh just views itself and what those relationships are like i don't know if
3974240	3981040	that's true um and let let's let's if if i may if you'll give me the title of the book if you'll
3981040	3988240	give me a minute yeah yeah it was a bestseller book but my my this idea that the right is
3988240	3995520	just tends towards more authoritarianism than the left i uh i don't know i don't it might be true
3995520	4000880	but i've seen a lot of authoritarian lefties in my day maybe it's a selection bias but i
4000880	4005920	hear this is an excellent book i highly recommend what's it called again republican brain by chris
4005920	4014000	mooney okay it is look i i think it's very clear like in recent events that the left is not pure
4014000	4021120	of this completely right but there is just more of a tendency it depends so there's like two
4021120	4025920	different types of authoritarianism right so there's like the autocratic authoritarian so the
4025920	4030080	the the strong man the person who who consolidates power into himself so that would be like the
4030080	4035440	fascist leader or the monarch you know the the singular strong entity but then on the left you
4035440	4041120	have like you have like democratic tyranny where it's it's mob rule and it's just simply by what
4041120	4045920	the majority wants which can also be very destructive so it's two different types of
4045920	4054240	authoritarianism i think yeah even then though right there are uh portions of the left um
4054240	4061520	though i guess some more authoritarian portions um that are democratic to an extent but then they
4061520	4066240	say something should never be voted on and it happens to be their most important uh values
4066240	4071280	as they think right like that yeah and so i don't i don't i don't know i don't know i'd have to look
4071280	4077920	into it more um i'm i well i i think i think that's just a practical necessity of obtaining
4077920	4082240	and wielding power you know that's just kind of how it has to be oh speaking of practical
4082240	4088320	necessities and uh retaining and wielding power and things like that um what do we think if i may
4088320	4092000	get your guys to i i see you chat i see you chat i know you want to talk about the gamer gate thing
4092000	4096960	i will ask a question about gamer gate thing i will i promise but let me let's let's let's save
4096960	4103600	it for the end to say about gamer gate is there anything new to say well we haven't sent it to
4103600	4109600	each other exactly exactly we will bury this hatchet but first right i am gonna spoil i i'm
4109600	4115520	not gonna get in a fight tonight i'm just not okay that's that's fine that's fine um but let
4115520	4125440	me ask this question instead uh for now um what do we think is the most likely outcome of this
4125440	4131440	upcoming election so tuesday we got a glimpse i think of where at least policy-wise the electorate's
4131440	4140560	at right now uh republicans got thrashed um ohio um formalized abortion and it's a uh a codified
4140560	4148400	abortion i should say and it's a constitution uh the virginia or the kentucky i should say the
4148400	4153280	kentucky governor won reelection he's a democrat uh almost across the board democrats had a really
4153280	4159600	good night um we could juxtapose that with the doom and gloom we saw on social media about how
4159600	4165520	people never vote democrat never vote for biden never vote for anyone um that isn't calling for
4165520	4172240	a ceasefire etc etc etc um but do we think that this uh constant calls will have an effect going
4172240	4179440	forward on the 2024 election these constant calls to just boycott um biden boycott um the left or
4179440	4185840	anything or or is this all just hot air i gotta be honest i have not paid attention to american
4185840	4190320	politics in the past week or so so i don't know what you're useless to me okay fair enough sorry
4190320	4198160	whoo go ahead uh i i think it's very serious um you know uh i i think as part of my job i did look
4198160	4203920	a lot at the the outcome from tuesday obviously i'm happy when democrats win uh don't read too
4203920	4210480	much into it okay just don't uh biden's poll numbers are extremely weak right now we're seeing
4210480	4213920	the number of muslims that are currently planning to vote for him i'm not talking
4213920	4219600	to twitter conversations i'm talking about real polls uh it's not a good situation uh his numbers
4219600	4224800	with jewish people are down as well uh if the election were held today joe biden would lose
4224800	4231200	by a lot and joe mansion is not deciding not to run again because he's tired of having power
4231200	4236800	he's not running again because he's looking at biden uh he's seeing a path for him to win the
4236800	4243680	presidency this is extremely obvious and we need to take this really seriously the reason biden is
4243680	4250640	failing right now in the polls is the first best job of the president is to lead on messaging
4251200	4258080	and look i think he's been a really consequential president but he um he is older and it affects
4258080	4263680	his ability to give speeches and connect emotionally with the with the public and um
4263680	4270400	his current strategy of hiding is not working out uh his uh you know his campaign has 91 million
4270400	4276960	dollars on hand the last time i checked uh they need to be investing massively uh across the board
4276960	4284800	in messaging and helping set a new conversation in my view yeah i mean biden's kind of a zombie
4284800	4290080	at this point he's he's really old it's there's no way to remedy that when you're that old you're
4290080	4294240	just you're just kind of done to be honest at the same time like there have been some some things to
4294240	4299840	come out of his administration that i like i really like the chips act yeah yeah i have always i've
4299840	4303760	been i feel like i'm a hipster when it comes to china i was where i was worried about them before
4303760	4310080	it was cool to be worried about china but um like there's been some if you if you stay plugged into
4310080	4315200	like the right wing online ecosystem you you'd think that the world's completely falling apart
4315200	4320720	and it's not there's some problems but it's not nearly that bad um but i do think that biden just
4320720	4327120	i think based almost solely on his age and now maybe on the october 7th response like he might
4327120	4332000	not be the guy for for the democrats but at the same time um the republicans are in shambles as
4332000	4338880	well you know all of those republican primaries are basically just the the the debate of who is
4338880	4346880	going to eventually lose to trump and trump seems to be he he's not a very good president
4346880	4351760	and he's also extremely popular on the right yeah so gotta get more serious
4352800	4359040	yeah okay i mean it it's the man trump's like a wild card right now right because for 2024
4360480	4364960	imagine the possibility of trump wins the election and then also gets convicted on one of
4364960	4372960	those one of those charges what a shit show oh my holy shit but like if trump's gone you know if if
4372960	4377120	he if he actually is found guilty and he's locked away and he can't be president like who do the
4377120	4384800	republicans have i i think this is what rhonda santis is hoping for just a miracle at this point
4384800	4390960	so um yeah yeah i don't think they rally around this but anyway i don't want to get too much into
4391760	4396080	finish your thought uh dev and uh basically if we're just talking strategy de santis should
4396080	4400560	have waited he should have waited for trump's i like to for trump to finally be either vanquished
4400560	4404560	or get a second term and then come along next time this was not the time for i think i think
4404560	4410560	de santis basically destroyed his political career jumping in maybe um i know that uh
4411440	4416480	it would be an open question at this point right who would take that uh standard from
4416480	4422000	trump trump goes away unfortunately i don't think trump's going away i think that uh whoever
4422720	4430560	that biden will be facing trump in the 2024 runoff um and we'll see uh i i see the polling today
4430560	4440240	the polling isn't uh it isn't comforting not to say the least but years a long time years a long
4440240	4445200	time i guess to to kind of maybe bring it into something that you have been following
4445760	4452800	um we've seen israel's messaging um of light how do you think they're doing dev do you see the
4452800	4458400	snl style skit they did the other day no i didn't see that either you didn't dev what are you are
4458400	4462800	you not paying attention to anything i've been away for a little bit i've been away for a little
4462800	4471280	bit sorry oh you're killing me bro you kill me okay um i i do know that like man when it comes
4471280	4478240	to the the israel-palestine conflict as a whole i'm like soft pro-israel but soft pro-israel you
4478240	4484720	know but man it's that's that's just that's just a shit show you have basically two sides that
4486000	4490480	i think beneath the mask they both want to genocide each other and one side is capable
4490480	4495360	of doing it the other side if the power balance were reversed they would be doing it so it's like
4495360	4499840	well like what the fuck you're gonna do at that point i don't think there's much that that the
4499840	4507440	west can do frankly i think it's like a hopeless situation fair enough i think we are seeing i was
4507440	4513280	talking to a really good uh jewish friend of mine about this about why there's such a generational
4513280	4520000	divide on on israel right now and i think it really comes down to the fact you know my friend
4520000	4526960	i believe he's in his uh 60s you know i'm in my 40s and yet we're both old enough to remember when
4526960	4533280	israel was really making a public messaging push and trying to help the public understand
4533280	4538880	why like the need for israel to exist was important you know things like that right now
4538880	4545360	we're really seeing one side uh make that case particularly to the left and uh you know i think
4545360	4551760	that when israel comes out and uh their response to a whole bunch of civilians getting killed in a
4552480	4559040	a strike that hits a hospital uh to basically kill one person it's like civilians die in war
4559040	4565040	which is nearly a direct paraphrase of what they said um you know it's it's really bad
4565040	4573280	messaging right um so i think uh anyone serious about uh national security will tell you that
4573280	4578160	um you're weighing the hearts and minds of people helping them understand and empathize with you is
4578160	4583520	a really critical part of that i think under netanyahu uh they're basically running the exact
4583520	4590160	same playbook that bush did which is harder right harder fringe messaging doing it in really moral
4590160	4595680	terms and not really making that effort to make the same number of friends so uh no wick i think
4595680	4602400	uh israel has been really really bad at messaging lately and i think if they don't change course i
4602400	4607920	think it's going to be there's going to be less and less willpower in washington to support them
4608800	4615920	and certainly all this uh you know horrific inexcusable level of civilian death is not
4615920	4624320	aiding that either so um i think they're i think it's really dire it has been a kind of like a mind
4624320	4631520	fuck almost yeah to watch the horrific images coming out of gaza um coming out of the airstrikes
4631600	4640800	and things like and then to have israel um put out an snl skit about it right um and you're like
4643360	4649520	someone is making these decisions consciously like is someone that they need to replace whoever
4649520	4655120	is in charge of that i understand why they're doing it i understand why they think they need
4655120	4660800	to use memes and comedy to appeal to the youth because as polling recently has shown
4662800	4669440	to put it mildly israel has a youth problem here in the west um they have been bleeding
4670160	4678080	support um from like again it's it's just a thing we grew up knowing that america supports israel
4678080	4681200	but i don't know if that's going to be the same in 20 years from now right
4681840	4690240	as the new cohort takes power and seeing not only the online response but also the polling also uh
4690240	4697600	the massive amounts of youth young people going into the streets not just saying free palestine
4697600	4705840	but gas the jews kill the jews israel needs to be destroyed intifada intifada from britain to gaza
4705840	4714480	right um there is a problem here um and i think israel knows it has to try to
4714480	4721840	reverse that trend i just don't think it knows how um what do you think that was just a public
4721840	4728720	messaging problem i think that you know look netanyahu and lakud party i mean they've taken
4728720	4733200	israel in a very very right wing direction and i think anyone that's being paid anyone that's
4733200	4739120	been paying attention to this including i would say the majority of jews in this country have
4739120	4744560	been increasingly um disturbed by the foreign policy direction of israel for quite a while
4744560	4749520	right so i certainly see that i don't think it's just a messaging problem i think it's
4749520	4755200	actually kind of analogous to america's reputation in the world following the iraq war right you know
4755840	4758720	no no any thoughts on this dad before we move on
4761600	4767280	if i were to like put myself in the headspace of somebody who let's say is very pro israel
4767280	4774800	who's who's in israel and is very pro israel i it feels like what they're probably thinking
4774800	4782320	is something like they saw what happened on october 7th and they saw all the memes come out
4782320	4788320	about paragliders and they're like oh okay so i guess we're just cool with killing civilians
4788320	4792160	and memeing about it now and so they're saying well then let's do that for our side
4795040	4799200	fair enough i don't think i think they real they they don't realize though that's not how
4799200	4805440	how the game works here we don't yeah it's not it's not tit for tat it's um we do it to egg you
4805440	4810160	on so that when you do it we can call you out for it and ignore that we did it too and then just
4810160	4814560	paint you as the worst actor ever uh fair enough uh let me read a super chat i got for you and then
4814560	4822000	we'll move on to the next question 10 bucks from lives and dev's walls i'm assuming it's someone
4822000	4829040	from your community sir yes how do we restore faith in or the integrity of necessary institutions
4829040	4834800	amid clear failures stopping the spread of ludicrous conspiracies requires viable claims
4834800	4841600	to be handled properly the way epstein wasn't and i would and this is my words now right to
4841600	4846800	maybe move away from the epstein thing one of the reasons that people think especially you think
4846800	4854160	america bad is because of the horrendous way that america handled foreign policy with the afghan
4854160	4862720	and iraq war especially the iraq war right um and the just uh abysmal failures um from the
4863680	4869760	foreign policy community um and how we have handled all these things so to his question
4869760	4874160	how do we restore faith in the integrity of it because just because america is wrong sometimes
4874160	4878240	doesn't mean america is wrong all the time but that seems to be the lesson that a lot of people
4878240	4884960	took from the last 20 years is that america is just that right so i i can speak to this from
4884960	4889520	the the point of view of like more right-wing people that i know right because they all believe
4889520	4896800	that 2020 was a stolen election i did on the night of 2020 and i don't now and i went through
4896800	4902960	a process of figuring out why it wasn't so i'm sure you've both seen that that that video that's
4902960	4907360	been shared around millions of times where the polling station closes up and then one of the
4907360	4911760	workers you know pulls back the tablecloth and brings out a case of new ballots right
4911760	4916320	then wheels it over and starts counting the narrative on the night of the election was
4916320	4920880	that that was a case full of fraudulent ballots right and it needed to be investigated and it
4920880	4925040	needed to be it needed to be answered for like why is this woman pulling these ballots out
4925760	4928640	um and that's what everyone was saying including me on the night of the election
4929200	4934640	um it turned out that as the as the court cases and went through and the audits went through and
4934640	4938880	all all these sorts of things to see if the election was actually real or not it turns out
4938880	4944720	that um if you actually go back and like read some of the buried articles about that specific case
4944720	4949520	the judge said okay i sat down and i watched all the security camera footage and that was
4949520	4954240	actually a case full of legitimate ballots that was brought in earlier and the reason that it was
4954240	4960480	brought in is because republicans in that state had changed the laws such that mail-in ballots
4960480	4965600	could not be counted until after all the other ballots were counted so they were just being
4965600	4970320	stored under the table until it was time to count them so it was actually one of those things where
4970320	4974480	republicans changed the law and then it created a video that they got that they then had a
4974480	4979600	conspiracy theory about right but all of my right-leaning friends didn't keep up with any
4979600	4984400	of these investigations or any of these trials or any of these audits they they had you know
4984400	4990640	that the 15 that the 15 minutes news cycle on twitter and then moved on to the next thing right
4990640	4996240	and so after a month or two of investigations no one's talking about it anymore so
4996480	5000400	pretty much like i i kept i kept my finger on the pulse of all these stories because i wanted
5000400	5005280	to know but like nobody else that i know on the right did and now here we are three years on and
5005280	5010160	people are still bringing up that exact same video clip as if it's as if it's it's proof of something
5010160	5016720	and it's not so i i think it's it's social media it's a shortened attention span and it's people
5016720	5022880	being in echo chambers and and that is causing people to spin up completely different theories
5023760	5028880	about about how things are actually functioning and because they never actually return back to
5028880	5033600	rethink those ideas through they just kind of sit in their brains for for a few years that becomes
5033600	5042480	what actually happened we see it playing out live like we see this video i saw of a helicopter an
5042480	5049840	apache helicopter blowing away hamas terrace it was originally shared saying that it was israel
5049840	5057120	just indiscriminately firing into the crowd at the uh the rave killing both innocent civilians
5057120	5063360	and hamas terrace and see look the idf calls most of these deaths um it was obviously shown to be
5064000	5068000	no they were attacking an entirely different place these were just hamas terrace that were trying to
5068000	5074400	run back into gaza after they had done their thing uh but it was too late it had gotten millions of
5074400	5079920	views hundreds and thousands of likes and no one's going to go back to that right no one's
5079920	5086960	going to to check it again it's now it's now it's now a fact and they are going to run with it right
5086960	5091520	yeah after it goes viral people aren't going to come back you know a week later or a month later
5091520	5096480	after the investigation is done they're just going to remember it as it was i think that's why like
5096480	5101920	you know look i i hear what you're saying about this being a problem it's certainly correct my
5101920	5107840	mind always always always goes what is the public policy solution how can we how can we start to do
5107840	5112480	this i think like something i'm trying to do as a public figure and someone that works in this
5112480	5117200	field and trying to talk more with people on the other side and trying to have civil conversations
5117200	5123280	i think it's really important for those of us to model this i think that but i think the real
5123280	5129600	problem that's really difficult to solve is it really comes down to the algorithm right we have
5129600	5135600	a fundamentally different information space now that rewards sensationalism it rewards conflict
5135600	5143120	it rewards hyperbole and it it's how do you square that with the fact i think all of us here
5143120	5148720	agree with free speech we agree with open expression we don't want anyone censoring those
5148720	5155280	hot takes but we've got to come up with the way that the american people are being better served
5155280	5160160	by the information that we're getting and let's be really clear this is not just an american
5160160	5166240	problem democracy is weakening all around the world and yet this being the way we consume
5166240	5174160	information is part of why it's it's destabilizing our country so i think this is i think it's really
5174160	5180560	really important and i i don't think that say facebook should have the amount of power it does
5180560	5187040	over the news uh that they do um maybe the answer is break them up i i truly don't know
5187040	5194080	but i i think something's got to change i don't know about uh policy uh like policies that can
5194080	5199600	be adopted to uh to improve this i'm not sure about that i do know that i have very little
5199600	5206000	influence over policy but i can control what i do right and so i can at least do better personally
5206000	5210960	and that's at least a little bit like you know if you are part of the world and you are if you
5210960	5216240	do better you've made the world slightly better so if all i can do is look at it from an individualist
5216240	5222880	perspective then that's what i do fair enough fair enough okay i'm going to ask the question
5222880	5231040	that my audience i know i know i know but it's it's it's here it's the elephant in the room and again
5231040	5237440	um well we gotta talk about it gamergate i've thought about the best way to do this
5237440	5243040	conversation for a little bit well then why not take it take it away dev man go ahead okay um
5244800	5249520	you don't have to get too in detail i guess but what was gamergate about from your
5249520	5253360	side from your perspective because you were anti-gamergate i was pro-gamergate so
5253360	5257600	since you're on opposite sides of the conversation i mean having seen me talk about this a million
5257600	5267200	times in media i mean so gamergate was about a organized harassment campaign against women in
5267200	5271840	the game industry i know y'all don't want to believe it was a real thing it was it hurt a lot
5271840	5278720	of people's lives and her reputations many of my friends quit the game industry uh permanently and
5278720	5284880	it was uh in my view the start of this playbook that when someone's saying or doing something you
5284880	5290640	don't like uh investigate them go through everything they've ever said find something
5290640	5296640	to smear them with and uh just try to destroy them by the with the mob um well speaking of
5296640	5300640	destroying with the mob sunday thanks for watching i see you making tweets about me
5300640	5303520	yeah you know i hope you like the channel as well but continue
5306400	5312560	so that's basically it what about you dev from your perspective so
5312560	5318880	um the pro-gamergate side is that it wasn't about harassment and it was actually about
5319680	5322720	there was ethical problems in in the gaming industry at the time
5325200	5330480	and i was definitely on board for the ethical problems i breanna i think you saw my my video
5330480	5336000	about phil fish and the investigation that i did like 10 years ago into the actual ethical
5336000	5342240	problems that that he was a part of because he did do some underhanded stuff um stardust at one
5342240	5346160	point when she when she was going to talk to you actually like was it six months ago or a year ago
5346160	5351120	or something yeah she she asked me about gamergate because she knew that i was involved in it and i
5351120	5355920	gave her my playlist of gamergate videos and she went she went through a few of them just to get
5355920	5361120	get a feeling of what it was like on the pro-gamergate side back then and i watched
5361120	5366880	a bit of her reacting to my old videos i hadn't seen my videos in 10 years and in the second video
5366880	5371840	i specifically say at the very start okay before we get in today's into today's content
5371840	5376160	i see that some of you guys are are actually harassing people and you guys need not to do
5376160	5382000	that you need to stop that shit so i was definitely even back then very cognizant about
5382000	5386320	the fact that there were some people who were taking it too far and also there were some people
5386320	5391920	who were simply hitching themselves to the situation to try and boost their own career
5391920	5398720	right people don't know this nowadays but milo came out of gamergate right yep um uh mike
5398720	5404000	cernovich came out of gamergate milo yanopoulos to be clear yes okay fair enough yeah yeah they
5404000	5409520	both yeah i don't have any issue with that yeah i've been friends with hat for my god 10 years
5409520	5414800	now right like he's one of those people trained as a journalist genuinely interested in the
5414800	5423040	the ethical concerns of that i just i think if all of us on this show tonight agree that uh the
5423040	5427760	outcome of progressive policies right now isn't always talking about health care it's about a
5427760	5433600	bunch of unrelated like cultural things that we do that are are not ethical i think we can
5433600	5440640	be honest and that like gamergate did a lot of that as well what's your biggest regret dev
5440640	5445360	what's your biggest regret from the gamer gate years my biggest regret from the gamer gate years
5445360	5449760	is that when phil fish sent me a cease and desist i listened to it and i took my video down
5450480	5453840	because i shouldn't have i shouldn't have given in to that kind of uh intimidation
5453840	5458640	can you just remind me like i like i i haven't spoken to phil in like
5458640	5462240	10 years but can you remind me what your ethical issue was with him
5464320	5473680	basically he he uh his game fez was the only game to win an award at the igf for two separate years
5473680	5479360	sure and one of them was for the demo of fez and one of them was for the actual release of fez
5479360	5483360	and the igf kind of hand waved up by saying oh it's a demo so it's not the same game
5483360	5487760	but it's the only game they give that treatment to that treatment too and then when phil fish's
5487760	5494320	company got hacked it came out that there were a bunch of people who were judges at the igf who
5494320	5499760	had invested in his company and they served and they they they were in a position to to
5499760	5505840	personally profit from the fact that the ig that that fez won so many awards and and was the only
5505840	5511280	game to win awards in two separate years it was like 2007 2012 or something like that yeah that's
5511280	5519280	pretty bad uh in to play i'm not defending that fez is a really good game though yeah yeah yeah
5519280	5524720	but i hear i hear you that's not defensible obviously they should uh ever use themselves
5524720	5528800	i just think you know directionally if you look at the state of the game industry today
5528800	5535120	i mean uh let's just be blunt uh ign is weaker than it's ever been kotaku hasn't been a force in
5535120	5541120	in the game industry in a while and you know when it comes to game coverage i think you know
5541680	5546960	skill up do a really good job uh but i think there's a whole host of youtubers that do
5546960	5552960	a much much worse job and they are directly being paid by these companies to come cover their
5552960	5559520	product right so i think if you look at i i just haven't seen that same level of anger at the
5559520	5564800	current state of the game industry which i think is way more rife with problems than it was a decade
5564800	5570800	ago i mean i'm i'm still like i'm still a pretty small channel in terms of the big leagues right
5571120	5575360	i know that like 150 000 subs is like kind of big but it's also kind of small to be honest
5575360	5581280	i don't have millions i don't have that much much reach um no i still talk 150 000 okay you know
5581280	5588720	what i mean like like there's guys out there with millions of subs yeah yeah so much i'm i'm okay
5589280	5594480	what i mean to say is like i can only do so much but i do talk about like shitty youtubers as well
5594480	5600400	sure on my channel yeah i i do my part channel mostly you shut a lot of progressives on tik tok
5600400	5604880	you have a like most of your videos are tik tok tuesday nowadays which is a shame because i like
5604880	5611200	your last foreign content so much more that is it's only because i'm lazy and and your situation
5611200	5615040	with them causing so much noise at your house so fair yeah there's been there's been some
5615040	5620720	construction and also i've been quite lazy do you think um i guess i'll ask this right
5621520	5631680	for the many years you've been covering culture around games games etc um dev what is what is
5632240	5638720	have we improved overall or as rihanna wu has asserted have we have we just gotten worse i know
5638720	5644400	for me right when i was growing up and i wanted to know if a game was good there was some magazines
5644400	5648640	i would read or pick up or Nintendo power yeah things like that i would look through them and
5648640	5653920	i would get the strategy there no ethical issues yeah i would get the strategy guides and things
5653920	5658960	like that and i would pour through them i would go to blockbuster and look at the cool games that
5658960	5664240	were up for rent and i'd do that nowadays if i want to get a game right uh or if i want to see
5664240	5671600	if a game is worth getting uh i will go and look at either a youtube playthrough through it and see
5671600	5679120	some reviews or a let's play i will go to the steam user reviews and kind of click through a
5679120	5685520	few of them positive negative um so that as a normie someone who isn't like a super gamer
5685520	5690320	that's how i usually engage with the gaming industry today versus back then so i guess from
5690320	5694480	someone who covers that kind of thing and someone who i would consider much more of a gamer and a
5694480	5699280	nerd than i am um dev what better worse what do you think
5703280	5710320	hmm i don't think it's better or worse i think it's very different things have definitely
5710320	5716240	changed but i think we're probably about the same level as we were well then let's go to individual
5716240	5721680	let's go away from the the overall then so what into an individual instance is what do we do
5721680	5729040	better and what do we do worse okay um well gaming press like you said breanna gaming press
5729040	5735520	is definitely weakened right like all these sites are shutting down and and the the institution the
5735520	5740320	the career of journalists doesn't have the prestige that it used to have so that's probably worse
5740320	5745040	right and now you can argue whether or not that's because they were bad at their jobs or whether it
5745040	5748880	was because we don't respect them anymore it's probably a mix of both because there's been some
5748880	5754640	really bad journalism as well um the issue with youtubers and this goes beyond what you're what
5754640	5759680	you're mentioning wick but it does also involve this um is that youtubers don't take themselves
5759680	5763760	seriously enough i think and streamers don't take themselves seriously enough this is not related
5763760	5770240	to gaming but have you met streamers like i what we take ourselves way too seriously but go on
5770240	5775840	i meant in terms of like professional ethics oh fair enough that's true but we take ourselves
5775840	5781440	super seriously go on drama yes but like okay okay this is not related to gaming but it
5781440	5786480	definitely you can use this logic on a whole bunch of gaming youtubers right do you remember recently
5786480	5792560	um hasan i think he went on it was on national tv or it was somewhere and he said i'm just a
5792560	5797360	streamer man i have no control over anything i can't i can't control what my audience does
5797360	5801040	i can't i can't set any sort of narrative and it's like hold on if you're the biggest leftist
5801040	5806480	streamer in the world you should have some ability to set the narrative are we talking
5806480	5812800	about hamas piker okay gary yes that's what we're talking about but like that's not gaming but the
5812800	5817680	point still stands is that like if you have a platform and it's a reasonably big platform like
5817680	5822640	we're talking like millions of subs or you know tens of thousands of viewers on twitch or something
5822640	5829680	you do have the ability to to set to set um to set conversations basically yeah and i and i think
5829680	5838000	that streamers they when it comes time for them to let's say be ethical in how they behave they
5838000	5841760	say i'm just a guy in my living room in my bedroom i don't know what's going on i can't affect
5841760	5848000	anything but when it comes time for them to take massive bags of cash from ubisoft or whoever they
5848000	5852320	take the massive bag of cash you know what i mean i do know what you mean um let me ask you directly
5852320	5858560	then um okay how do you fill your audience in this how do you abdicate your responsibility
5858560	5860480	have you or are you above the fray
5862640	5868400	well i don't take massive bags of cash there's that's one thing like i i've made i've made a
5868400	5871760	deal with myself that if i'm ever going to do out like a product sponsorship for example
5872320	5876880	it has to be something that i actually like and use myself i won't i won't like i know i don't
5876880	5882080	use vpns um until i start using one i'm not going to take a deal for a vpn for my channel right
5882960	5886000	it's one of those it's one of those types of things that's kind of how i view it is like
5886000	5893280	i i want even if you disagree with me i want people to trust in the fact that i'm saying what
5893280	5899600	i actually think even if you don't like it yeah yeah i feel the same way i take a i take a lot of
5899600	5905760	pride in the you know my professional integrity i mean i really try very hard to tell the truth
5905760	5911120	i try to answer questions even when they're unpleasant when they're asked of me and i try
5911120	5917920	to engage issues honestly and yeah sometimes that comes from critiquing my own side um you know and
5917920	5923360	it's it's hard i mean i feel like all the incentives now this is something i see over
5923360	5928240	and over again in the streaming space like wick my assessment is there are a lot of really
5928240	5934320	fundamentally dishonest people in this space it's really hard trying to figure out who to talk to
5934320	5941360	who to interact with who not to what have you uh like so i know we've talked off screen right
5941360	5946400	about different people and things like that but i i just want to get a well i have two questions
5946400	5952160	for you one to go back to the same question i asked dev and speaking of asking hard questions
5952160	5959760	um i know you talked about um how one of your regrets is keeping it online and not taking it
5959760	5964400	offline and do things but other than that regarding your behavior towards others right
5964400	5969680	yeah do you have any regrets oh my god can you absolutely maybe talk about that a little bit
5969680	5976480	and then i i did i my second question to keep in mind would be um that since we live in as dev set
5976480	5981120	a space where there are people with a lot of influence who's abdicated for it how do you how
5981120	5987120	do you sift the wheaten from the chaff who do you decide how to why did you pick me to to work with
5987120	5993760	instead of sunday for example like like how do you how do you filter i guess go on well you're
5993760	5998320	not a congenital liar well true but no you know what i mean i'm being hyperbolic but you know what
5998320	6003200	i'm saying how do you sift the wheat from the chat so i feel like i've answered the same question a
6003200	6009600	million times i'll do it again um you know i know gamergate wants to pretend like what they did
6009600	6015280	didn't traumatize me but it did i had a clinical ace of trauma alive women in the game industry
6015280	6021840	also had clinical aces of trauma um it fucking broke me uh the stuff that went on um
6023120	6032720	so i can look back at my behavior and see how reactive and angry i was and i was not
6032720	6039920	always responding to things in a way that was productive right so i think if i did it over
6039920	6045680	again you know i would have unplugged from twitter a lot sooner um i think i would have
6045680	6052080	held on a lot of media appearances until i could react without so much anger in the moment um
6053120	6059680	so i just you know i feel like i squandered this opportunity to really advocate for better policy
6059680	6065760	for women in the the game industry and just on a personal note you know i cause so much pain
6066480	6073360	like one of the things is when you're traumatized you you you hurt the people around you um you know
6073360	6081600	i hurt my friends um i hurt uh you know i love frank dearly but i think he saw me at uh the
6081600	6090000	worst in some ways during gamergate right um so just just in the the midst of trauma i acted with
6090000	6098160	a lot of pain into things i'm not proud of right i do want to point out real quick sure um my
6098800	6103440	my involvement with gamergate was only on the ethics side of it and i certainly wasn't
6103440	6107200	responsible for any of that i'm sorry that it happened to you though i appreciate that thank
6107200	6114080	you can we can consider the hatchet berry of enemies uh of all they become i consider you a
6114080	6119840	friend i mean i well maybe not a friend i think we have a respect for each other we have a respect
6119840	6125360	for each other right like i like you i like your content i don't agree i preferred friend but okay
6125360	6129760	let's see if you want to be my friend i'll be your friend what's up dev what's what's your favorite
6129760	6133920	part what's your favorite thing about brianna woo today what's your favorite what's brianna
6133920	6137520	woo's best quality what do you like about her most friend of brianna
6144400	6150640	irrespective of of how victimized you were 10 years ago you definitely had some crazy takes
6150640	6157280	yeah back then and you do not seem like that crazy person now and that's actually that's
6157280	6164960	actually quite heartening because so many people just get worse over time well i i'm sure that
6164960	6169680	that probably sounded like a backhanded combat i didn't mean it to you but i i get it i think
6169680	6175520	that running for office did teach me a hell of a lot about how to advocate for things that i
6175520	6182880	believed in right um so i think that was part of it was a real growing up experience so um thanks
6183120	6186560	i guess i i would hope that you would see me as somebody with integrity
6188160	6193040	you know do you make friends a lot dad do you have a lot of friends like uh just curious
6196320	6204240	kind of okay i have you you recognize that it was just a like sort of a shit answer but go on
6204880	6213280	no it's it's there's a lot of people that that i think can't stand me and sometimes i wonder why
6213280	6217840	and it's like well like is it my personality that's a problem is it like but then i realize
6217840	6224480	usually it's because like i'm i'm pretty honest and that can drive a lot of people away and it
6224480	6229920	doesn't mean that i'm like a perfect truth teller i just i i do i i don't i talk the same way online
6229920	6234800	is off i talk the same way public as in private you know i found that just like keeping secrets
6234800	6239280	and kind of like being a backroom schemer it it makes you a worse person in the long run
6239280	6244320	so i don't do that and that rubs some people the wrong way but five dollars from cryborn to say i
6244320	6249040	like brianna's pragmatism and recent work with bringing together left-wing streamers thank you
6249040	6253360	for the five dollars and thank you for a good example of a good answer to that question um
6254320	6255200	i guess uh
6257280	6260880	well same thing uh i think you already said about his videos but
6261760	6268000	you consider him a friend what about him that you like right personally i i think you have
6268000	6274000	really insightful criticisms of the right and the left um i don't i don't think you're as much of a
6274000	6280080	centrist from my point of views i think you you you tell yourself that you are but i think you
6280240	6287120	are i'm sorry am i a right winger from your point of view i don't know if right winger i think you
6287120	6295680	have a kind of instinctual distrust of anything um i think that when someone comes to you and
6295680	6301200	tells you they don't feel like they're getting a fair shake in society i think you have a kind of
6301200	6309120	instinctual uh tendency to dismiss that um that and i don't think you're coming to that like
6309120	6315200	inauthentically or i don't think it's egregious right uh i i just i don't think it's the right
6315200	6321200	answer right uh but what i appreciate about you is i think in the the course of your i think you
6321200	6326560	produce some extremely thoughtful videos i think you're actually a really friendly person and
6326560	6331360	honestly i really this is silly thing but the way you talk about your um is it your girlfriend or
6331360	6337440	your wife naomi uh it's really apparent how much you care for her and uh i i think that uh i don't
6337440	6342960	know it just makes my heart grow three sizes every time i hear that i'm actually told that
6342960	6348560	a lot that like i relate whenever our relationship bleeds into online people really like it yeah
6348560	6355840	yes how did y'all meet if i can ask um we both worked the same awful part-time job back when i
6355840	6361680	was in school yeah and we just kind of stayed together even after i left you know no five
6361760	6365840	dollars from artemis fowl dev is my favorite white nationalist communist
6366960	6375120	thank you oh my god so yeah like there was that there was that one short of demon mama
6376000	6379840	demon almost called me a fascist so many times at this point but there was that one where like
6379840	6388080	it was demon mama was lambasting you for talking to me brianna meanwhile i can go to some very far
6388080	6394960	right youtube channels where i'm being discussed and i'm like this leftist subversive communist
6394960	6400400	cuck who's trying to get into right-wing spaces to like convert people so one of the big reasons
6400400	6406320	why i do think that i'm a centrist is because so many people say the same things about me on two
6406320	6410320	extreme sides but they're inverted and it's like okay there's something here i think there's something
6410320	6417200	i deal with that too dev that doesn't make me a centrist i'm not you know like the exact same
6417200	6421040	thing happens to have the left screaming at me i've certainly had the right screaming at me
6421600	6429200	i mean how is it's it's the same thing right maybe the difference um i have a i have a saying
6429200	6433360	i've been this is i think this is gonna become my like my dev saying this would be my branding
6433360	6438240	it's this idea that um governments should be liberal and people should be conservative
6439040	6443600	that's kind of how i i lay out my approach to politics because can you elaborate on that
6444400	6453840	sure sure so um when it comes to government policy like big big ticket things what what federal level
6453840	6460160	governments should do in america or in canada or in other other similarly sized states i tend
6460160	6465280	to agree more with liberals than with conservatives not consistently you know i'm definitely more pro
6465280	6470000	gun than the average canadian for sure but i mean my stance on health care i think americans would
6470000	6475120	consider americans who aren't terminally online would consider to be far left right something
6475120	6482480	like that however when it comes to how i think you should organize your life on a personal level on
6482480	6486480	like a local level i'm much more conservative because i think those things are generally just
6487040	6492560	better for people right you know like having having you know uh a good family life for example
6492560	6496560	that's that's more of a that's more of a conservative thing than let's say a progressive
6496560	6502240	thing but it's very important for people right having like more traditional family roles people
6502240	6508080	tend to be happier on average when they engage with those with with those types of of lifestyles
6508080	6510960	it doesn't mean you should be forced into it there's lots of conservatives that think you
6510960	6514640	should be forced into it i don't think that at all right if you're if you're you know cut from
6514640	6519760	a different cloth then go ahead and do your thing right here's a good example okay so i think i was
6519760	6526320	talking to dylan burns a few months back um and i want like i was outlying to him you know the
6526320	6530480	conservative case for gay marriage right and basically the the argument that i was playing
6530480	6537120	to him is let's say that you're a young gay man and you have two life paths ahead of you right
6538240	6544080	and down one life path is you could get into like a monogamous relationship and adopt some kids and
6544080	6549520	raise them right get a decent job and contribute to your community be a be a productive person
6549520	6553280	you know and but these are all very conservative things even though it's a gay person doing them
6553280	6559520	or you could you know go go to the gay bar and be very promiscuous maybe catch a few diseases
6559520	6564400	you know debase yourself debase other people make people not proud of you you know what what would
6564400	6569520	be you're allowed to to to engage in hedonism because that's what a free society is but
6569520	6573920	what should you do you know what would be better for you what we what would be better for
6574560	6580400	the people around you if we what what character should you have as a person right and it seems
6580400	6586560	like more often than not organizing your life in a conservative way not necessary not necessarily
6586560	6592240	a religious way but a conservative way does seem to make people happier and healthier so
6592240	6595360	on the local level i'm pretty conservative on the national level i'm pretty liberal
6596880	6601920	you know i've been married for 15 years i'm a pretty you know i've got a house i've got a
6601920	6609520	job you know like i i certainly agree with that i think where i i would really ask you and i don't
6609520	6614480	mean this disrespectfully but my my critique of you would be the exact same as tim pool in
6614480	6622320	the sense that there's such a a disproportionate amount of of um criticism that i think happens
6622320	6628560	on your channel right um and and i agree with that like i certainly have had plenty of criticism for
6628560	6634720	the fringe left lately but it's also true my day job is 100 about beating the republicans at the
6634720	6641600	ballot box right that's what i'm paid you know to do so i mean how can you see yourself in the
6641600	6649360	middle when so much of your content is about going after the left the main reason i do that
6650080	6657600	is because it's very criticism of the rights very simple right we all kind of intuitively get it's
6657600	6663520	like you know should you oppress gay people no obviously right like should you be racist
6663520	6668400	no it doesn't it doesn't take much brain power to explain why you shouldn't be a racist or why
6668400	6673040	you shouldn't be a homophobe you can easily lay these arguments out criticism of the leftist
6673040	6678960	complex it takes a lot more thought um you have to understand a lot more about i think about
6678960	6685680	certain things because i i think it's not that it's not that leftist ideas are necessarily more
6685680	6690960	complicated it's that they're more ubiquitous you know what i mean it's like it's here it's like
6690960	6695680	you know what is your your stereotype of a conservative it's like a you know like a you
6695680	6700400	know a redneck living in a flyover state who's kind of an educated he might be a bigot right
6700400	6706160	he's kind of an easy enemy to attack in a sense like what is your average left-leaning person
6706160	6712960	well he generally higher IQ generally makes more money lives in a more affluent area he seems to
6712960	6722960	have more markers of success going his way it is in terms of philosophy leftism i think is in a
6722960	6730320	stronger position than rightism and so it requires more in-depth critiques i think i i hear with i
6730320	6735120	hear what you're saying and i agree with you the problem with leftism is a more interesting
6735120	6742240	conversation i i think the reason i think a problem i see consistently on your channels i
6742240	6748240	think you really underestimate the cultural power of the right i just went to south carolina
6748240	6753840	to debate john doyle i talked to a lot of students on campus i talked to a lot of people down there
6753840	6759680	in the south it was really conservative and i think that uh your vantage point of living in
6759680	6765200	canada and having your perceptions of the country primarily filtered through media i think if you
6765200	6771520	had worked in election cycle in ohio or new hampshire i think that that would really change
6771520	6778080	your perception very very quickly yes it also might be the case that um canada does not have
6778080	6783680	the same kind of right wing that america does yeah well i think that's that's just also a you
6783680	6788800	big like just a true statement right yes obviously canada the right wing and america right wing i
6788800	6794400	think are not in the same place and now you can point to some um overlap i know that canada
6794400	6800080	canadians often complain about how american politics kind of seeps over the border a little
6800080	6806320	bit uh and influences their uh electorate and things like that i i yeah it's just different
6806320	6812880	problems different things if i may read a couple super chats um and then i will kind of wrap this
6812880	6817520	up but i want to take calls do you guys want to take some calls right yeah let's do it people in
6817520	6823600	here let me read these super chats and uh and and have some closing thoughts here and then we'll get
6823600	6829440	into i had a couple of questions i wanted to ask down oh no if you have questions by all means i
6829440	6835360	will i'll step back but money first money first five dollars from lives and death walls public
6835360	6841760	service announcement just buy a tortilla press and masa harina more than worth the extra effort for
6841760	6847360	the difference in quality the leftovers can be made into chips well thank you for such a uh that
6847360	6853040	service announcement it will be go to service and two dollars from the same individual nooms is cool
6853040	6860480	i'm assuming noons is naomi um yes fair enough i gotta go i'll be back in a second oh oh and
6861280	6866080	i guess in the meantime then gang if you're liking this content if you're enjoying what you're saying

6910320	6916400	uh defend his assertation and food shops will be there to challenge that um i am also going to be
6916400	6926320	talking uh to no opinion saktan left and brianna whoa on thursday the 16th um that will be fun
6926320	6931520	that's a i don't know if you guys know who no opinion is he's one of the largest uh sub i
6931520	6939360	think he is the largest sub stack uh out there um he's got hundreds and thousands of followers and
6939360	6946800	readers um and he's been making blog posts about sucked on left and brianna will brianna will you
6946800	6952880	gotta mention in his latest one i don't know if you read it um and so yeah we connected and he
6952880	6957600	wants to talk to him and so i'm going to facilitate that conversation that should be fun i'm really
6957600	6963040	looking forward to that he is so smart and so thoughtful i really appreciate him well he's
6963040	6968320	he's very left-leaning right but i think he sees a lot of the same well what's the title of his
6968320	6974960	latest piece give me uh let me get get it up a second it's basically uh yes it's possible to
6974960	6982560	imagine progressive dystopias so he has seen a lot and been very critical of the left the far left's
6982560	6988000	response some among the far left's response to the october seventh thing and so he has really
6988000	6994160	come out and stood against that so it should be a fun and interesting discussion he's also so pro
6994160	7000880	national security very very smart on national security i'm not in this war hawk like you know
7000880	7007200	let's bomb our way to utopia kind of way like really thoughtful about uh you know what our
7007200	7013920	investment in the military gets us the good sides the downsides our need to you know think about uh
7013920	7019120	when we're talking america withdrawing from the world uh what happens when china and russia uh
7019120	7024240	go into the power vacuum just just a really thoughtful person so i'm really looking forward
7024240	7030000	to this i'm very very curious uh ten dollars from artemis fowl can anyone tell me why lefties are
7030000	7035360	up in arms about giving palestinians a state slash one state but don't say anything about
7035360	7042080	kurtistan or tibet seems like progs are simply hypocritical i for one remember when free tibet
7042080	7050080	was the left's reason to tear right like they were very big on free tibet um i i don't know
7050080	7057600	uh to answer your question i'm not sure uh what do you think what do i think about that uh
7057680	7064480	uh no i really agree with that i think that there's something
7066320	7072160	i i don't want to accuse people of like it only being about anti-semitism but it's hard to not
7072160	7077360	notice that some people are being held to a different rule set uh when it comes to this so
7078000	7084160	maybe a more charitable answer would be that looking at the uh you know oppressor oppressed
7084160	7089840	dynamics and having that be your pathway to coming with every single answer is not always
7089840	7097360	a very good way to do it probably so welcome back i'm back i'm back yeah i know honestly
7098480	7103360	i think when it comes to tibet it's honestly because 20 years ago china was not nearly as
7103360	7107680	powerful as it is now that's simply that's just it and you think because they are now
7107680	7112880	a major power that the left has stopped uh they're they're a major power and there's
7112880	7118240	multiple avenues for them to morally browbeat people who are far left they can use the race
7118240	7123440	angle they can use the socialist angle it's very easy for them to say to say whatever it is to to
7123440	7128160	get them to stop talking about tibet because that was like a leftist cause 20 years ago yeah
7128160	7136160	absolutely free tibet was a big thing um i know that brianna had questions just a couple questions
7136160	7142800	okay i want you to look over here do you see this corner my office that is an original parasite
7143360	7151200	poster from uh japan and that is the original final fantasy 8 poster from japan those cost me
7151200	7159040	an ungodly amount of money so i wanted to ask uh why are these both uh uh these this is the
7159040	7163200	soundtrack to your channel so i've always wanted to ask you is parasite eve like is that an
7163200	7170240	important game for you the same way it is for me um i don't know how important it is i don't
7170240	7175600	think it's on my top 10 but it's really it's on my top 20 for sure as far as the soundtrack it's
7175600	7182480	got to be in the top oh so so when i'm choosing soundtracks i'm i'm looking for something that
7182480	7188320	fits a specific not it's not droning droning is not the right word but it's kind of like droning
7188320	7195200	where it's almost like investigative all right so i use yeah that's why i use the timber soundtrack
7196160	7201040	well that was uninvestigated that was goofy yeah right okay but but like parasite even a lot of
7201040	7206640	parasite eve tracks um the police station for sure and also the central park track yes those
7206640	7211840	are both they both feel like you're in an investigation so i use those for for investigative
7211840	7217920	videos oh i was hoping you were a huge fan that's so sad no i i am a huge fan but i'm not like
7218560	7224320	they're like man it is in my top 20 so i guess i am like a pretty big fan but i'm not like the top
7224320	7229600	tier of fan if that makes sense okay fair enough my favorite game of all time is earthbound which
7229600	7235760	is a very lefty answer i love earthbound good game i have an original earthbound and i don't
7235760	7240720	even want to tell you how much i spent on that is it is it inbox with with the book no no i don't
7240720	7247600	do that i i have games to play so um but uh yeah i love that thing oh my gosh i think you know
7248720	7253520	it like for all this talk about like making america great again i think that there's a
7253520	7260000	political movement based on just bringing back the greatness to the video game industry of that ps1
7260000	7266560	square soft era of games which gave you vagrant story which gave you ein hander which is this
7266560	7273360	under valued amazing ps1 shooter with the most amazing soundtrack like all the final fantasies
7273360	7279200	final fantasy tactics all of these games make a movement to like bring that back to the game
7279200	7284800	industry and i don't even care if it's fascism i will be on board with that i miss that so much
7285360	7290560	yeah there were some good games and man their attempts to like redo it they're really hit and
7290560	7294480	miss like you go play like oh yeah traveler yeah like upper hill is pretty good but it's not the
7294480	7300480	same as like final fantasy 6 it lacks it kind of it's hard to put my finger on right it's
7300480	7310960	the certain if you will it just it feels too formulaic too clean too um too processed i guess
7310960	7314800	when you're playing octopax traveler it's the fact that you can play as all the characters
7314800	7318560	or none at any point in time so they can't have any meaningful interactions with each other
7319120	7324720	so it's always like a lack of meaningful choice is what you're saying to me no not choice
7324720	7329760	interactions so if you play like like a final fantasy 6 or a final fantasy 7 the characters
7329760	7333360	are always going to have the same interactions at the same point in the story right yeah you
7333360	7337920	play it multiple times if you play octopath traveler because you can get you can recruit
7337920	7342560	the characters in any order you want all of their plot lines happen independently of each other
7342560	7346400	and they never had the characters never feel like they're actually on an adventure together
7346400	7351680	and that's a big problem um second big problem is that the writing is just needs to be edited down
7351680	7355760	there's like three times too much dialogue in octopath and i think that's because like
7356720	7361360	if you're thinking back to like the ps1 or the snes you're uh like and you're thinking back to
7361360	7364800	when you were like nine years old or something because i was i was pretty young when those games
7364800	7370640	came out the it feels like in your memory there's way more dialogue than there actually is yeah if
7370640	7374720	you go back to like final fantasy 6 right now and just like emulate it and speed through it there's
7374720	7380960	not much dialogue not really um but it felt like a lot as a kid so to get the same feel they just
7380960	7386480	bloat the dialogue up in a game like octopath traveling just way too much i don't i feel like
7386480	7392400	one of the things that made final fantasy 6 so good is they really thought about the amount of
7392400	7397040	grinding that you have to do one of the reasons 8 is so great is because grinding doesn't do
7397040	7402240	anything for you in final fantasy 8 and you can actually like you can do a final fantasy 6 play
7402240	7408880	through in 10 hours if you know where you're going so i think i think these games are so bloated
7408880	7415440	nowadays that they lose a lot of that magic in my view yeah i think a lot of the bloat really
7415440	7420000	comes from the fact that when you were a kid you know 60 hours seemed like a lot more than
7420000	7425520	it does when you're an adult yeah and also you know that was your one game for like six months
7425520	7431600	or something if you get anymore yeah um i like all the same games that you do well you mentioned
7431600	7437200	earlier in this conversation right like the it's the um too much access i think that maybe
7437200	7443680	too with games is the same thing yeah too much it's also um fifty dollars just real quick fifty
7443680	7448960	dollars for mark swain's revenge uh do you guys think that fundamentalist islam which compels
7448960	7455280	men to emulate the prophet muhammad is inherently dangerous for all non-fundamentalist islamists
7455920	7465760	it's a spicy one that's pretty spicy anyone want to take a crack at it well so i mean the answer
7465760	7469840	is going to be yes on some level and you can make the same argument for other religions like every
7469840	7475760	religion has its fanatical version that is dangerous to other people um i think islam might
7475760	7482720	be unique because it carries within it a doctrine of how to set up a religious state and most
7482720	7488640	religions don't have that in their in their doctrine so it might be uniquely dangerous
7488640	7490960	that doesn't mean obviously that all muslims are dangerous or anything like that
7491680	7497280	i think that if you got out into the world and the democratic party you would see that at least
7497280	7502480	here in this country a lot of the muslim americans that are here are some of the most progressive
7502480	7508000	thoughtful smart kind loving people that you will ever meet in your whole life um you know like jink
7508000	7514880	is not um he's not muslim like extremist when it comes down to it so uh i'm not comfortable
7514880	7520480	i'm not comfortable with blanket statements like that i think that um a lot of muslim countries
7520480	7526720	are not democracies uh and i think that uh that obviously causes a lot of problems and repression
7527760	7531600	i mean it's the same it's it's the same that canada doesn't we have like a huge muslim population
7531600	7536320	but we have a very big sikh population it's the same with them right like their their religion
7536320	7541520	is overall very peaceful and yet canada has recently had like the sikh terrorist issues
7541520	7545280	which probably didn't make it into the american news but like there's there's stuff happening
7545280	7549920	up here that well they uh they uh assassinated that's not all sikhs obviously uh i think
7550800	7558400	india uh struck them like killed one of the sikhs in canada i believe is yeah yeah so the tldr the
7558400	7564320	tldr that is that the sikhs want like an and they want an ethno state for the sikh religion in india
7564320	7568480	in an area called calistan they're trying to break it off the indian government obviously
7568480	7575440	doesn't want that um there is a big i i think i think the violence hit its peak in 85 when they
7575440	7584400	blew up a flight going to canada all right well okay real real quick the tldr is that a bunch of
7584400	7589200	the calisthenian um extremists moved to canada they kind of blended in because canadians are
7589200	7592800	like they're very they're very nice and polite and open and welcoming from their country so of
7592800	7597360	course come here of course not knowing what was actually happening and so now there is this this
7597360	7605040	growing calisthenian issue in canada where canada might be harboring some legit terrorists and india
7605040	7609600	has now um assassinated one of them on canadian soil which has caused an international incident
7610240	7613520	absolutely so that's something happening here that americans aren't americans aren't paying
7613520	7619360	attention to it it's happening right real quick five dollars is lizam right about women that is
7619360	7628640	a troll obviously not our artemis fowl i know him he donates a lot of money yes he trolls every
7628640	7634560	single time i am okay with that uh but you had a question a last question and we have some colors
7634560	7640160	backstage gang if you want to get uh in line uh well they were backstage where they go uh
7640160	7644160	exclamation point discord and chat or click the link that i provide in the youtube chat
7644160	7648800	uh accept the rules and then jump backstage and we'll pull you on one at a time to talk to these
7648800	7655440	wonderful individuals but go ahead last uh i'm good to go let's get to the colors oh no no it
7655440	7661440	was like a video game question maybe uh i it's covered it's cool i'm cool oh okay okay okay um
7661440	7666160	actually i i have a question for you then okay like you're very clearly a squaresoft fan yes
7666800	7672560	yeah okay um you like earthbound so you have to like rpgs probably like chrono trigger as well
7672560	7681680	yeah it's really good it's really good yeah um how about like like western rpgs like vampire the
7681680	7686800	masquerade bloodlines that's considered a classic it's good i've never done a complete playthrough
7686800	7693040	of it i mean does mass effect count as a western rpg i think that's the greatest video game ever
7693040	7699760	made i mean which one uh well two is obviously the best but all three of them in order i mean
7699840	7704000	come on that's the greatest story our our industry has ever produced in my view
7704640	7707840	i uh i keep everyone says two is the best i think one is better than two
7709200	7716000	this story is better but the gameplay is not i i like that old style of kind of
7716000	7722160	uncompromisingly janky gameplay well which class do you play because i do uh assassin
7722160	7728160	and sniper rifle so maybe that's why we have a different perspective uh engineer so i've
7728160	7734480	never done an engineer play through how does that work um well in the in the future games you get
7734480	7741040	drones and you get turrets and those are those are really nice you can basically like there's
7741040	7745520	a way to play mass effect where it's basically the loneliest shepherd where you recruit as few
7745520	7750320	people as possible you kill off as many partners as possible and you go it alone for as much as
7750320	7755200	the game and you play in engineers that all you have are like robot buddies it's a really fun
7755200	7760320	way to play the game but like it's everyone is dead and you can actually pretty much break the
7760320	7763680	game by the end of the playthrough in mass effect 3 because the game doesn't know what to do because
7763680	7769120	everyone's gone so if you're on vermyer you're sending ashley and caden to go die basically
7771440	7778160	um okay what one last question yes how about how about deadly premonition i i don't know this game
7778160	7784640	what are you talking about it is a horror game from the 360 yes i remember this this is the one
7784640	7791440	where paranoia affects your your sense of stuff right uh no okay i'm thinking something else no
7792240	7801360	uh it's basically twin peaks the game oh my god and i i i definitely have like a hipster sense
7801360	7806400	of taste when it comes to uh to to games and tv and movies so i love twin peaks
7806400	7810240	i love that whole aesthetic and that that's that type of storytelling and deadly premonition is
7810240	7814080	twin peaks the game it recently got a switch re-release you can play it on modern consoles but
7814080	7821520	it's it's like unfinished and kind of comedically it's comedically unfinished but the charm of the
7821520	7827520	game is just it's over the top i love it it's it's on my list of top 10 it's twin peaks yeah
7827520	7831440	i like it when your channel talks about games you had a really salient thoughtful
7831440	7836640	analysis of final fantasy 16 that uh i i didn't agree with all your conclusions but i thought
7836640	7841840	it was a really interesting thought uh like analysis of the plot and the the political
7841840	7850400	subtext of it so i wish you'd do more of that there's one coming tomorrow oh fancy okay so yeah
7850400	7856880	the tldr of it is basically um there's this idea that conservatives they they're media illiterate
7856880	7861280	you know we're talking about this before before before we started the idea is like they they watch
7861280	7866560	the boys and they see homelander and then they like seal clap not recognizing that it's it's
7866560	7872080	criticizing america and criticizing like american like exceptionalism right and there's probably a
7872080	7879040	lot of truth to that at the same time though there's this view again mainly among breadtubers
7879040	7884240	all right it's it's it is it is leftist crazies who are terminally online they believe that like
7884240	7888880	all media and all all entertainment media has messages that are exclusively for them and
7888880	7894720	if conservatives enjoy something that they're um they're coping or they're like intellectually
7894720	7898880	dishonest or they have some sort of dissonance in their heads and it's like no no there are
7898880	7903920	actually good conservative stories right legend of zelda i gave you the example legend of zelda
7903920	7908080	is a conservative story because in every single game link is restoring the monarchy all right
7908080	7914240	there is a there is a hard conservative subtext in legend of zelda for sure so i'm i'm i'm making
7914240	7919760	the argument libtards coping and ceasing right now i i'm making the argument that there are
7919760	7926560	definitely like anon is authoritarian though anon is authoritarian yeah of course he is yeah
7926560	7931520	yeah but i mean authoritarianism isn't isn't exclusively a rightist thing and monarchy is
7931520	7936400	certainly a monarchy is certainly exclusively a rightist thing every single time link puts
7936400	7941440	princess zelda back on the throne that is reaffirming monarchy it's unclear how much
7941440	7947760	political power zelda actually holds i am i am not prepared for this debate but fair enough let's do
7947760	7951760	it um but let me read these first five dollars from tempered squeal for giving me lovely
7951760	7957040	background noise while i work love the conversation and five pounds from conus x
7957040	7961440	since vampire the masquerade was mentioned i am dying to hear dev's opinion on werewolf
7961440	7969440	the apocalypse the tabletop not the video game i don't know much about it sorry my only experience
7969440	7974960	with is it is it what is it called like it's called the dark something that universe i don't
7974960	7981520	know what it is my only experience is with a vampire unfortunately fair enough um gang yeah
7981520	7988320	call in there was a few of you earlier waiting um and then we took too long i guess but uh i guess
7988320	7991600	we're going to go into the column portion so if you've been watching this and you have questions
7991600	7995760	that you think wick why didn't you bring this up wick why didn't you ask brianne about this wick
7995760	8000240	why didn't you ask why didn't your whole dad's feet to the fire about this right now is your
8000240	8004880	chance to call in and talk to these lovely individuals yeah we've had a nice pleasant
8004880	8010080	conversation let's add some conflict and let's let's ruin it by bringing in the chatters okay
8010080	8015760	well you know you're dirty dirty chatters okay you're only there to be seen not heard normally
8015760	8023040	but now i am dining and giving you i am condescending to opening up the floor to you
8023040	8031520	dear chatter to for a brief moment in time to fill that void that uh exists within your empty
8031520	8037040	lives with a little bit of attention right so jump backstage i see we're getting a couple
8037040	8042640	colors right now but jump backstage and we'll pull you in two dollars dev where's the trucker video
8043840	8047680	uh plus one day plus one day let's bring in the first caller
8047680	8052080	hello a lot
8054560	8061680	hey guys how you doing um hi it's too friendly in here i i'm gonna try to get you guys to fight
8061680	8068400	with each other a little bit uh no i'm just kidding uh i mean maybe um my question is mainly
8068400	8074720	brianna esta if you want to answer you can you guys like briefly touched on cancel culture earlier
8075040	8081600	i was just curious uh brianna if if you see any um because to me there's a there's a pretty
8081600	8087120	discernible party line between the type of emotion that the phrase cancel culture like evokes in
8087120	8092480	people um you know like like people right-leaning conservatives tend to think of it as like the
8092480	8099200	villain the big bad bogey and then um left-leaning people generally see it as like a dog whistle for
8099200	8105200	basically anti-wokeness or anti-progressivism um as a figure of yourself do you see any um
8105920	8109840	can you identify any concerning aspects of cancel culture like what it's done to progressives
8110720	8117200	oh um yeah first of all i think this is one of these things where no one is taking a long enough
8117200	8122160	historical view of this i'm old enough to remember what happened to people that spoke out against the
8122160	8128800	iraq war of which i was one of them right and there was a very real sense if you spoke out
8128800	8135920	against president bush right after 9 11 that you would lose your job um you know there was um so
8135920	8142640	i think the conservatives have been running you know cancel culture for a long time um yeah i
8142640	8148320	think i have a different assessment i don't um i do think i i actually want higher standards for
8148320	8154960	people in how we express ourselves publicly but i think uh it's really obvious that this current
8155520	8161920	playbook of trying to get everyone fired over the most minor statements and just making witch hunt
8161920	8168560	witch hunt witch hunt the uh way that we advocate for change it's it's not working uh i think a lot
8168560	8174560	of people think progressives are assholes uh now i think that we have less cultural power today than
8174560	8182240	we did 10 years ago and um i i think there is certainly an illiberal element to this you know
8182240	8187600	i think that no matter your views at the end of the day we're a democracy we need to settle our
8187600	8192960	differences at the ballot box and i think there does need to be more tolerance for allowing people
8192960	8199440	on the other side to have their say so um i realize that's a more nuanced uh view than just
8199440	8208160	cancel culture bad but this stuff is really like free speech is this there's a lot it really matters
8208160	8213600	how you approach that principle and how you safeguard it right just to give one super quick
8213600	8220400	example when it comes to national security we all agree with free speech but like russia is
8220400	8227040	weaponizing our ideals against us and by using bot farms to exacerbate our divisions here in
8227040	8232160	this country make it seem like things are more inflamed than they are and now the new warfare
8232160	8237040	against the united states is it happens with trying to basically inflame these differences
8237040	8242640	between people what is the answer for that like we can't like start just censoring uh people
8242640	8248080	disagreeing with each other but we should certainly have a policy to like identify bot farms
8248080	8257840	um so all this stuff is really complicated um okay do you do you care more about progressives
8257840	8264640	looking like assholes or do you care more about um potential like sustained casualties from um
8264640	8269360	people catching strays i guess from uh from as a result of cancel culture and what it's done to
8269360	8276160	progressivism i genuinely care about both um i think both are extremely high downsides
8276160	8280000	like on a priority list i would say both of those are an a-level priority
8281600	8286720	okay so do you agree with your honor we were do you have a more um negative outlook on it
8286960	8293520	um you have to repeat a little bit sorry i spaced i'm just curious
8295840	8301920	uh so beyond has identified uh basically that uh cancel culture uh oh why don't you i don't want to
8301920	8307040	um brianne if you could give them a summation it started with dixie chicks basically or like
8307040	8310720	not didn't start but like the right was doing it earlier and you had like dixie chicks that
8310720	8316000	could get canceled i remember that from back in the day yeah yeah um but i do think freezing it
8316000	8319440	as conservatives have been running cancel culture for a long time is probably not the
8319440	8324960	most accurate way of characterizing it i don't think this is the dark part of the human heart
8324960	8330960	it's no one side has political power gamergate was about cancel culture in a large way against
8330960	8337520	feminists in the game industry i mean everyone's gonna like everyone's gonna say like i'm against
8337520	8343120	cancel culture but here's my political opponent and here's some evidence that he might have raped
8343120	8348560	someone so let's get him fired everyone's gonna feel like that's just in the moment right but it
8348560	8354400	probably isn't especially if the evidence is not good so ah it's it's tough it's one of those
8354400	8361040	things where it's like do you do you really want to have complete free speech because then you do
8361040	8368720	get the russian bot farms that like you mentioned before but i don't know i will say there's there's
8368720	8374640	this sorry go ahead no um i will say this about the whole thing uh we're going to see a lot of
8374640	8379280	people speaking out rightly so in my opinion i want to be clear this is good that they're
8379280	8383920	speaking out against it the people losing their jobs over pro-palestinian stances in the coming
8383920	8391120	months right we're going to see that happen over and over again on the left and if we had not
8391120	8397040	created the mechanisms to get people fired from their academic jobs for right-wing views right
8397680	8402800	um we would not be seeing this today at least not at the numbers we are so this is the thing
8402800	8410720	if we want to be able to say and speak out on controversial important issues we have to keep
8410720	8418400	that shield strong when people we don't like in fact may hate come out and say things that we hate
8418400	8425600	or oppose and i think that keeping that shield strong to protect us all is going to be what
8425600	8432640	gets us out of this mess and we just have to re-return to our roots as a nation and say
8433200	8439600	i may not respect what you say but i respect your right to say it and i think we need to really
8439600	8444880	cling to that again um sorry dev i didn't mean to cut you off but i i like free speech is my thing
8444880	8449920	okay this is what i that like like that that sounds really good but i think there's probably
8449920	8454080	some logistical problems in there because for example if you like you later on this but go on
8454880	8460000	let's say you have two political parties right and you know the political power is being handed
8460000	8464240	between them each election and one political party is completely fine with censoring their
8464240	8468560	opponents so they don't even give a shit the other political party says you know what no free speech
8468560	8473520	for everyone we're all everyone's gonna we're all gonna play by the same rules you end up you end up
8473520	8479520	in a position where every time the free speech party takes power their opponents get to run
8479920	8484720	get to run wild with free speech every time they the free speech party is on the outs
8484720	8489680	they get censored and it becomes this one-way battle right so you almost have to have a standard
8489680	8496240	of you're only going to censor the censors in a sense but i think that censorship right uh
8496240	8501280	in a real way it's cutting off it's getting short-term games absolutely short-term gains
8501280	8506640	can be gained from it absolutely but i in a very real way i think it undercuts and undermines your
8506640	8511440	own position so while yes the one party who engages in censorship while the other doesn't
8511440	8516240	uh short term it's going to have a lot of success when it gets power to be able to censor and cut
8516240	8521200	off its enemies but i think at the end of the day like the good guys are good guys for a reason it's
8521200	8526000	because they don't do the things the bad guys do right um and i know that's a simplistic way
8526000	8530400	of looking at it but i think most of my audience are simpletons so we're gonna keep with the
8530480	8538320	analogy here this is where like respect i know we fight on this but go on you're obviously a
8538320	8542400	really smart guy but let me give you a really concrete example of where i think it's just a
8542400	8548400	little bit more complicated than i i think you acknowledge so uh here's a really good example
8548400	8554960	my good friend carrie gold book's amazing book on this talks about some of her fights to try to get
8554960	8560960	big tech to do things that are correct when it wasn't in their uh profit interest right she
8560960	8567360	runs a really great law firm um and one really concrete example of this is someone uh was on
8567360	8575200	grinder and they had a jilted former boyfriend who sent made a habit day after day after day after
8575200	8583120	day of sending random strangers to his house to have sex with him so he would be cooking dinner
8583840	8589360	somebody would be knocking on the door trying to have sex with him right just did this constantly
8589360	8596000	she tried everything possible to try to get um basically grinder to expand their own terms of
8596000	8602000	service and take action against this they just would not do anything about this you know under
8602000	8606320	hold on like the way you're talking about this like that's a free speech issue they're making
8606320	8612000	their own account right so i think all of these things if you really dig into the policy of like
8612000	8617600	ways away 230 is implemented in this country i want to keep 230 but i think the critics have
8617600	8623600	some real fair points that deserve a policy answer so i think the more you know about this subject
8623600	8629360	the more complicated all of it actually gets but that's the thing the situation you described isn't
8629360	8634800	sure speech because speech when i say free speech and absolute free speech i'm thinking the ability
8634800	8639840	to express ideas without censorship for that what you're describing is something that is different
8639840	8646880	that i'm fine with um i i we we have no i have no compulsion or compunction with you um engaging in
8646880	8653680	mechanisms that shut that kind of behavior down because it's a different style of thing now it's
8653680	8660560	like the heckler's veto right um it's cutting the mic instead of allowing people to speak and there's
8660560	8665200	a such a difference there but i don't want to hog this conversation up porsche ran away because we
8665200	8670640	stopped talking to him uh it's color time right um but if you guys question real quick yeah but
8670640	8674960	if you guys want to just real quick if i may if you guys want to read the best book i've ever read
8674960	8681680	on free speech kindly inquisitors look it up check it out it's great i forget the author off the top
8681680	8687520	of my head but kindly inquisitors you can google it and find out um it's a very very good uh
8687520	8692480	treaties on why free speech matters and why it's important i wanted to ask this but i forgot i've
8692480	8696720	remembered it was was that the ikea trans shark in the background as well
8700240	8705920	oh yeah yeah yeah it's wahaj all right yeah yeah okay i figured i thought it was what i
8705920	8711360	don't know so i just wanted to confirm yeah so i had blachage before blachage was a trans icon
8711360	8717920	believe it or not there was an article that came out i think it was back in 2017 about ikea
8717920	8722640	canceling this shark and a whole bunch of russians getting angry about it and i saw
8722640	8727600	this story of it i was like oh my god that is the cutest thing i've ever seen i've got to get that
8727600	8734880	shark and then like years later blachage became a huge trans icon so i was in way before the trend
8736160	8744480	all right okay guys ready for the next caller let's do it speaking of trolling
8744480	8748560	artemis foul welcome hi artemis what's up you're live how's it going
8752080	8757840	artemis yes i understand i'm unmuting myself hey hey how's it going how come you're not
8757840	8764080	involved in the project zomboid server with kibbs i have a a job that is very important
8764080	8768400	that makes a lot of money do you think i have time to play in the middle of the day when everybody
8768400	8776880	else is supposed to be at work well that that is our job sorry yeah so i do have a question for
8776880	8785200	everybody here so the right back in the day in the 90s was pearl clutching about you know evil
8785200	8792080	satanists and stuff like this and doing the slippery slippery slope argument of they're
8792080	8796240	going to destroy everything or it's the end times that the left gets what they want right
8798960	8803200	now seeing how far the left has gone in terms of its policies and enacting them
8803840	8808720	would we say more or less that the right was correct in that where it was heading or
8810800	8818240	or is it not because for my example c.s lewis talks about the moral tyrant right that never
8818240	8824800	sleeps whereas the the republicans are evil in a lot of aspects but at least at some point they
8824800	8832640	stop messing with you they have so go ahead i mean no we'll finish your question then we'll
8832640	8840000	respond i promise is is the it was is the right was the right correct about the slippery slope
8840000	8845920	of the left because from what everybody can see in the last 10 years the slippery slope is not
8845920	8852240	no longer a fallacy but just a an inevitability at this point can i help you with it can i help you
8852240	8856320	out with an example go ahead so i i think i don't think i agree with you but i think i know what
8856320	8861920	you're getting at okay so there was definitely this idea back when it was uh being uh gay
8861920	8867440	marriage is being debated is that if if we if we allow gay marriage they're going to be having sex
8867440	8871520	with animals they're going to be having sex with children they're going to be doing all this weird
8871520	8875120	shit and that was that was the right wing argument and everyone back then you know kind of rolled
8875120	8880560	their eyes and said okay grandma like this is obviously stupid right and now you have a lot
8880560	8887360	of right wing accounts online that are promoting instances and they in my opinion they're isolated
8887360	8892240	instances but they are bad instances of let's say trans people doing weird things with children
8892880	8898320	and i think even though that's that's i think it's a minority of instances it's enough and it's been
8898320	8903600	amplified enough that right wingers are currently saying we were right the whole time is that what
8903600	8909120	you're getting at basically well the right wingers will say that but i'm just saying is it can anybody
8909120	8914480	see the argument there i can see the argument but i don't think i agree with it necessarily
8914480	8920640	i think both sides have you know slid more and more and more into extremes and i think uh
8920640	8926640	probably one of the failures uh is i've engaged this tonight i think we haven't acknowledged how
8926640	8933600	crazy the republicans are now some absurdly high number of republicans nowadays don't even believe
8933600	8940000	in democracy when when mitt romney that's not my opinion that's mitt romney's opinion when he
8940000	8946560	resigned from the from the senate right so um i'm not gonna tell you that the hyperbole of my own
8946560	8954480	side does not go to crazy town it does it absolutely does but i don't think that issue is
8954480	8960640	limited to to one side i'm not gonna um i'm not gonna tell you who but it was a pretty famous
8960640	8966080	person on the right and i was talking to this person the other day they were telling me how
8966800	8973440	uh with their algorithm when they go on to instagram it's like recipe of how to make a bomb
8973440	8980240	like recipe on how to like create your own like flammables for a riot right like it's this
8980800	8986800	constant deluge of stuff to literally bring out an insurrection right and just how stunning they
8986800	8994080	feel about how their own side is behaving so um like i think dev i know you have a really good
8994080	9000000	video criticizing this word reactionary and i know i'm misusing it according to your definition here
9000000	9005920	but i do think that all of us are coming just so emotionally charged in the way we
9005920	9010400	respond to each other it's it's it's leading some really crazy stuff
9010400	9021360	what about you wick well i talk a lot about on my channel about reciprocal radicalization
9021360	9027120	and how both sides have driven as brianna said each other into more and more extremes because
9027120	9033440	they have to fight the other side so when you talk about like um was the right correct that
9033440	9042880	the left was going to go this direction um yes and no but it's it's a self-fulfilling prophecy
9042880	9048880	because i'm very they are they have created this monster they are responsible for this monster in
9048880	9055920	a lot of ways um and i don't think they can solely take blame obviously right i think the left has
9055920	9063920	autonomy um but at the end of the day there is a party of sanity still and i i say it's squarely
9063920	9071120	on and most issues the democrats um republicans they're again they're i i don't want to i don't
9071120	9076880	want to like i have a large republican audience right they are not crazy they're sane but their
9076880	9083920	leadership and a lot of the policy positions that have been pushed by some of these people are out
9083920	9088640	of the out of out of this this world now that isn't to say that the left doesn't also have
9088640	9094160	crazy policies that they pass or push right like this idea that they're going to to remove
9094160	9101360	standards for eighth graders on um you know uh math or Washington and things like that right it's
9101360	9108320	it's it's again for a very specific group of people sure yeah yeah but they are they are it's
9108320	9114560	a it's a there it's a tit for tat right it's a tip for tat we have to go hard because if we don't
9114560	9122560	go hard they're gonna go hard like mansion has decided not to run again because he's gotten so
9122560	9129280	he again this man joe mansion i'm gonna stand him for a little bit right he got it a huge uh
9129280	9135440	win for energy for american energy past he also was again an important seat he voted progressive
9136160	9143200	what 90 of the time and but because he didn't vote for it a hundred percent he got crucified
9143200	9150480	and that's not going to make the next replacement be less radical right or uh it's not that's the
9150480	9154640	argument against joe mansion i think i think the issue is is that most people in the left
9154640	9160960	thinking it was a blue dog and a republican in a uh an all but name it's the corruption
9160960	9167680	it's the outright corruption in the uh medical industry well i think that you know like
9167680	9173760	ruling on issues of like uh basically the use of fossil fuels and sabotaging bills while he's
9173760	9177760	actually owning one of those companies i think that's pretty outright corruption
9177760	9182320	do you think that no but do you think oh brianna come on you you don't think that when the left
9182320	9187840	criticizes mansion that's not what they're criticizing at least that's not what i see
9187840	9193840	that's not there's certainly a portion of the left that does that but um you know we are a
9193840	9200080	political party and when one person is sabotaging you know our president's efforts to get certain
9200080	9205760	legislation passed i think he should expect blowback i mean mansion certainly gets this i
9205760	9211680	mean this is democracy functioning but mansions replace like we have cut okay no this is where
9211680	9217280	i agree with uh matt matty glacius right he talks about how mansions and the problem is that we need
9217280	9223600	a lot more mansions the and hold on before progressive tour crucifies me the problem is the
9223600	9229840	senate is like as a structure is fundamentally stacked against the democrats it always will be
9229840	9234000	this is the reason we have a bicameral system in the first place in this country is because they
9234000	9241040	knew that uh you know they wanted to have uh continue slavery and they knew um that if you
9241040	9245600	leave these issues up to just the popular will the people they're a lot of powerful interests
9245600	9250800	are going to be crushed the senate is fundamentally stacked in favor of the republicans so if you have
9250800	9257360	more moderate people out there that we're growing to be able to win some of these states that are
9257360	9264160	more conservative leaning like west virginia that will over time give democrats more power and i
9264160	9269520	agree with that hold on there's there's definitely better arguments for the existence of the senate
9269520	9275520	as it currently stands in that though yes it serves a good function yeah the senate the senate
9275520	9283280	is there to tamper uh tampin expectations on like situations of high intense fervor from passing
9283280	9289760	through the the lower house that the house and then that's the that's the whole point is just
9289760	9294640	for change incrementally so that people don't go and say and start a war that destroys the
9294640	9299040	nation that's the whole point of the senate and to provide some type of check and balances
9299120	9305760	against large population centers look i i look i am an institutionalist at my core i don't have
9305760	9310400	a big problem with the senate i'm talking about a strategy about how the democrats can get more
9310400	9315760	power uh you know if mansion stepping down we don't have candidates on deck that are moderate
9315760	9322240	that can win in west virginia so um i would love like don't get me wrong i'm a pro-abortion
9322240	9328720	pro-feminist uh progressive but i think if we are interested in keeping the senate it makes sense to
9328720	9334240	have candidates on deck on those states that we can run and win and get political power for
9334240	9339200	ourselves so i got a question on the ohio thing oh one last question but we do have a uh do have a
9339200	9345120	line so yeah one last thing i'll get you so why do you think that the ohio abortion thing is a
9345120	9351600	knock against uh republicans what do you mean because republicans are staunchly about letting
9351600	9357280	states decide abortion rather than allowing the overall federal government to make a sweeping
9357280	9363040	judgment on it uh i think that it is going to be terrible look this if you want to make this
9363040	9367840	an abortion question it's going to take a whole hour so not about the abortion but about the
9367840	9372000	allowing the states to the individual state to decide their own policies it's terrible for
9372000	9376640	women's public health this is a right men would never allow a law like this to be passed about
9376640	9382800	their own bodies it is leading to terrible outcomes and like it's horrible top to bottom
9382800	9387680	so i do not support that okay that's fair i was just going to say that that argument would have
9387680	9394240	had valid before 2020 and the covered lockdown but the but that that covered lockdown destroyed
9394800	9400880	that argument because nobody cared about self self uh choice when it comes to medical procedures
9400880	9407440	oh during that time so okay this might be it's true this might be its own thing no that's fine
9407520	9414560	you know me yeah thank you for your statement on that that's it i i i just wanted to know but
9414560	9421760	thank you okay um and val thank you for coming on and thank you for the super chats uh so here's the
9421760	9428560	thing i can considering what i know about artemis's job i know that he's a glowy if you know what that
9428560	9435360	means he's actually yeah he actually is a glowy yeah okay that that would actually be an interesting
9435360	9439440	conversation you and him because you probably both know way more about the american government
9439440	9446640	than i do sure so because he actually does work in in it to some i i can't talk about how but he
9446640	9452240	does he has are you doxing are you doxing this guy is this no no i am not okay i just don't
9452240	9458400	want you to like oh i know that guy here's his address and name and he he has overthrown several
9458400	9464720	south american dictatorships i'm not anti-law enforcement kind of gal i mean you know i've
9464720	9469440	worked with the fbi multiple occasions of multiple projects at this point you know when
9469440	9475280	my congressional campaign was hacked by russia they stepped in and was really impressed by the
9475280	9481280	skill of their cyber security team i think it's really important for national security right so
9481280	9489120	um was actually hacked by russia yeah how do you know that because i can't get into it but i do
9489120	9496000	know this okay there are new stories about it go read them okay fair enough okay yeah uh next caller
9498240	9499280	soy addle hello
9502560	9509360	soy addle soy addle oh there he goes uh oh he's gone don't click the join voice button
9509360	9515680	don't click it i'm sorry discord silly um unmute yourself and go go ahead yeah
9516080	9525920	so dev when did gamergate actually start was it like pax 2014 was it uh a week before
9525920	9530240	when adam baldwin tweeted about gamergate or was it long before then
9533440	9540240	what why are you a shark i figured i'd telegraph my position as and trigger you a little bit
9540640	9545200	oh jeez when did like when did it start i don't fucking know dude was it when adam baldwin tweeted
9545200	9550000	gamergate was that like because that was like it didn't have a name was it wasn't a nameless
9550000	9554800	movement before then or it was like it was it was the same movement but it probably it was
9554800	9559040	nothing less before then yeah but it was a movement yeah so so we we've got a narrative
9559040	9564240	that that's coming from the author of the gamer gate book that uh you had to be a time traveler
9564480	9570320	that you had to be a time traveler to do everything that has been attributed to gamergate
9570320	9576880	and this kind of debunks that so if it was a movement before adam baldwin then that narrative
9576880	9582480	doesn't play out and i want to make sure that we're honest about that yeah so all right what
9582480	9591120	was what was sort of this the the the the incentive the uh sorry the the spark that set off
9591120	9596320	yeah it was the most it was the zoe post right okay so no well but then you're saying i don't
9596320	9601200	agree with that by the way i think it was adam baldwin and and all that that's when we got the
9601200	9608000	name in in my view i think uh zoe is incorrectly uh credited as the catalyst for game again i
9608000	9613200	actually think it started with amita sarkeesian before then and a feminist frequency gang founded
9613200	9620080	because right after that what is not historically recognized is how that playbook immediately
9620080	9625840	started bleeding over into the personal lives of women in the game industry they've been talking
9625840	9631600	about equality so um yeah i think that's when it started i i can only tell you what i remember
9632560	9637520	i remember you know you know hanging out in 4chan and anita was making videos and everyone was
9637520	9640880	shitting on her and saying these are bad videos she doesn't know what she's talking about she's
9640880	9649680	not a real gamer all that was happening but i don't remember any sort of like consistent united
9650640	9656320	until the zoe post dropped and then until like the next day or two when you had a bunch of those
9656320	9662000	gamers or dead articles drop that's when i i remember specifically everyone coming together
9662000	9666720	to be like there's something wrong here yeah so from inside hold on just one second because i
9666720	9672000	love this uh there's an article i wrote just before all of that stuff happened it's called
9672000	9678720	no skin is thick enough uh for polygon i was told at the time that was the third most read piece for
9678720	9686320	that year um and this was before the zoe post it was talking about the horror and shit show
9686320	9692640	that was happening to women in the game industry um you know starting with uh samantha allen
9692640	9698000	basically quitting the entire game industry because of the doxing and harassment that she got
9698000	9704160	uh there's just been erased from all of this so um i i hear you and i believe you when you say
9704240	9708080	that you weren't really aware of that but women in the game industry
9708080	9713920	were it was really really bad for us two dollars to tell uh soya to put the shark back but uh go
9713920	9720160	ahead okay well i'll get your two dollars back later but basically if um you know from my
9720160	9725840	perspective being in a different part of the games industry yeah it it there were conversations
9725840	9733840	around how do we expand the customers how do we get away from the toxic xbox call of duty crowd
9734800	9741040	and this is where the gamers are dead sentiment was built i know that we had like the journal
9741040	9746560	the journal list conspiracy which which was kind of proven and i've seen like different
9747200	9754880	groups of people in media gather in private messages but then of course we also had similar
9754880	9762400	things happen political organizing in 2016 so we we no one's innocent here from from like this
9762400	9769760	collusion back back channels but it certainly did sort of like this overall position of the
9769760	9777360	industry pushing for expanded customer base dismantling the aggression like dick wolves
9777360	9784320	episode and all of this was pressing on industry to perform its image and i think that's why even
9784320	9790160	if it was coordinated behind the scenes that's why we did have sentiment redefine gamers somehow
9790320	9795680	and just one more word on this um because i really i have nothing new to say on gamergate but just to
9795680	9800960	to tackle what you're talking about people miss this historic part of the industry because this
9800960	9807280	was when mobile started eating the lunch of triple a studios before gamergate one of this
9807280	9813360	bad game that i still enjoy it's called alpha protocol it's a mass effect clone i was made by
9813360	9819760	sega i think the budget was like 20 million dollars or something this was this b-tier game
9819760	9825920	that the game industry was able to produce just a few years before gamergate but mobile started
9825920	9832080	changing it so much that we were looking for new audiences and we were realizing we couldn't keep
9832080	9837040	talking to the exact same kind of people making these same kind of games because development was
9837040	9843040	getting more expensive audiences were looking for something new so i like a lot of this stuff that
9843040	9848720	got the core gamer so angry i i don't want to sound like a communist but it was capitalism
9848720	9853840	right it was this force in the game industry to like find new people to buy your stuff
9855840	9860080	i mean that's true to an extent um this is something i'm trying to i'm trying to work out
9860080	9866240	in my head oh god and it's a it's much more complicated for this for this conversation um
9867680	9873280	capitalism and communism don't really operate in the kind of dichotomy that most people think
9873360	9880800	that it does you know because your answer to this question capitalism is okay fair enough go ahead
9881600	9888160	well they they they both have like universalizing forces within them right because capitalism wants
9888160	9895280	to um as you said in increase the consumer base in order to do that you need to appeal to a whole
9895280	9899120	bunch of different demographics with different tastes which means you're gonna get yours too
9899120	9908640	i don't have one this is not fair so basically as you as you increase your uh your install base
9908640	9914560	for a product that means you have to start appealing to different types of people who
9914560	9918960	all have different different ideas about what they want to buy which means some sort of
9918960	9924880	universalization of what you're offering right it has to be it has to be acceptable to 10 different
9924880	9929040	types of people all with 10 different sensibilities which which necessarily leads to some sort of
9929040	9934080	watering down so there's a capitalism has this universalizing effect but communism also has a
9934080	9938480	universalizing effect and they're kind of like twins in that regard this is something that i
9938480	9944480	don't fully understand yet i'm still trying to work it out in my head but i think like
9946080	9952960	there is there is something corrosive to small communities whether they be online communities
9952960	9958160	or even real life communities like small towns that capitalism brings into the equation that
9959120	9965280	socialism or communism cannot actually solve it only exacerbates and i don't know what to do about
9965280	9971280	it i don't quite know how to formulate this idea very vague i will say and also i can tell why some
9971280	9975840	people might say that you're a subversive communist infiltrating right-wing spaces okay yeah probably
9975840	9982160	yeah anything else before we let you go so i don't know yeah that kind of ironically what dev said
9982160	9989920	kind of ironically goes into why i think the left is so bad on palestine right now because they are
9989920	9996880	identity opportunists rather than being on mission and on mission would mean dismantling structures
9996880	10003520	of oppression this is yes yeah and somewhat relating to what dev's saying is that okay so
10004640	10010960	bland market consumer level you know twitch subscriber level socialism doesn't solve it
10010960	10020160	because that's all about land back and you know all of the these groups of people are good and
10020160	10026080	we should support them rather than we need to smash gender hierarchy and that's yeah that's
10026080	10031120	what being a leftist is well so that'll thank you for being here thank you for your questions and
10031120	10038080	thank you for the blah i don't know if i'm saying that right let's see let's go i love
10043680	10048960	i could be mispronouncing his looks so new he's new on the blah train i've been here for years
10049920	10055680	okay oh god five dollars from artemis dev was picking me weak for caving to online harassment
10055680	10061040	he wants me to you know i'll just say yes fuck you this is like a meme in my community
10061680	10068640	i'm not familiar but fair enough don't cave to the harassers gang it only makes them stronger never
10068640	10074640	apologize um that's not true you should apologize if you do something wrong but there is a the crowd
10074640	10079360	doesn't want you to say sorry it wants your blood right and it will so here's the thing like yeah
10080880	10086480	i'm sure i've never experienced anything as bad as you have as you have as you have during gamer
10086480	10091680	gabriella but i've been harassed on the internet as well you know yeah if you have if you have a
10091680	10096400	channel of of any sort of size you get harassed for something somewhere right and the lesson i've
10096400	10102480	learned is just never back down never apologize if you think you're right and it's a hard lesson
10102480	10107040	to learn for sure but it's definitely served me well over the years where it's like no i actually
10107040	10110560	think that i'm correct about this and i don't care if there's a thousand people who want my head
10110560	10116800	i'm not going to give in i think there's some quality some psychology of you that i haven't
10116800	10125120	quite figured out yet where you you mention a lot like there's like five or six videos about how you
10125120	10131520	don't have trolls remorse and i i don't mean to put you on the psychologist couch but i think
10131520	10137200	there's some part of you where your identity of yourself and the way you perceive yourself
10137840	10143760	is is based in this kind of the edgy chats you were having back in the 2000s
10144400	10150960	and i still have don't worry and i i think it affects your analysis of things in a way that
10151600	10158160	doesn't help you get to the right answers always maybe i i think it's just that you can
10158960	10165760	you can always it never hurts to have a greater constitution you know sure and that's kind of how
10165920	10170160	how i viewed i viewed things like that okay let's bring out we got a we got a few more
10170160	10174160	now i want to get through on the callers gang i had um i know that i want to respect your time
10174160	10179200	as well i'm just about done yeah i know so we'll we'll get through the current crop i'll make sure
10179200	10187440	they are in a timely manner and then we'll close it out oh let's get them in hello you're live you
10187440	10194640	got a question or a comment i suppose uh yes can you hear me we can what's up hello this is one of
10194640	10202640	my viewers what's up dude uh hello uh i was just wondering do you think uh horseshoe theory is
10202640	10209200	correct me or brianna brianna uh i'm getting sold on it
10211520	10217440	uh it's hard to think it's right another one is do you guys think government should break up
10217440	10226640	monopolies like intervene i think one of the things that makes america different than china
10226640	10232080	is if you look at the ascendance of something like bite dance uh you know china and the prc
10232080	10237200	are just synonymous with bite dance anyone that tells you they're not is just lying to you
10237200	10243360	outright and i do think that a good thing about this country is america tends to be a little bit
10243360	10251280	more laissez faire in picking winners and losers so i i think that i actually really agree with
10251280	10256400	elizabeth warren that when it comes to some of these really really big companies in the tech
10256400	10265200	space though um we're really limiting innovation because no one else can operate in the space they
10265200	10271040	get either bought up immediately or just crushed or a company like facebook will will just come in
10271040	10277840	and dominate them by stealing their features so um i think in general i think over my lifetime the
10277840	10283440	the government has gotten less willing to use their power to break up monopolies but i also
10283440	10290400	think it needs to be done extremely extremely thoughtfully um because it's not always bad a
10290400	10298000	really good example is uh in the game industry we've seen a move towards uh the model of things
10298000	10305120	like game games pass right where uh microsoft or sony will actually own the studio and then will
10305120	10311520	fund direct development these kind of b-tier games this is good in some ways and it sustains a lot of
10311520	10318000	smaller development studios that also leads to you know more vertical integration in the game
10318000	10324560	industry so i i don't think it's like either or i think that it's um i think we need to look at
10324560	10328080	these situations but i think overall we've not used that power enough
10330800	10338160	okay uh did you get your questions answered sir uh i got one more one more quickly uh
10338880	10346160	hey dev what's that font you use in your videos uh the old one was called handy sands
10346960	10351040	but in order for me to start using it legally it was gonna cost you like ten thousand fucking
10351040	10358240	dollars pieces yeah so i switched over to atma and i use atma bold all right find that you can
10358240	10363200	find that for free on google fonts thanks all right thank you those are my questions all right
10363200	10370560	bye go to blambot.com uh i've used them for my professional design work for years uh their
10370560	10377280	licensing fees are very very reasonable very awesome awesome i guess real quick regarding his
10377600	10385440	his horseshoe theory uh question the more i'll be very quick wick i'm sorry no it's not like we
10385440	10391760	could like look we can we could talk all night if you want i just don't have to go yeah um
10391760	10395200	basically like the more that i've been reading political theory the more that i've been convinced
10395200	10403040	by horseshoe theory because i've yeah i keep i keep finding like these 1920s and 1930s socialists
10403040	10407040	who are writing like fascists and i'm like how did this come about why is there this
10407040	10410800	link between these two ideologies and the more i read the more that i'm like okay there's like
10410800	10414400	a pipeline here or something something has to be going on here and it's been like obscured in the
10414400	10420560	modern era because nobody reads political theory anymore but something's going on yeah i would uh
10420560	10429040	on this i i don't know if policy wise it holds up horseshoe theory but i know behavior wise it
10429040	10435760	absolutely does um the further you go to the extremes the more willing they are to engage
10435760	10441200	in certain types of behaviors that if you go away from those extremes are seen as unacceptable
10441200	10448720	so in that way i think horseshoe theory is is is a circle honestly um the more extreme fringes
10448720	10455040	of certain beliefs are willing to any means necessary it no bad tactics just bad targets
10455040	10460160	and we can see that on both sides and it is a problem it is absolutely it is something that
10460160	10464720	we need to get away from immediately but yeah that's my thought uh you guys ready for the next
10464720	10471040	call let's do it real quick real quick artemis foul two dollars ask dev how he lost his license
10471040	10476240	he wants to reveal all my deep lore okay he's gonna have to if he wants to interrupt and and
10476240	10482720	and things like that that's cool we like your money driver's license but uh when i was like 21
10482720	10489920	i'm i'm not 21 anymore and i can i i'm fine now okay but way back in the day i drove a
10489920	10495600	dump truck for the city of toronto i worked for the municipality awesome i was driving around
10495600	10501840	with the back up because i had dumped a load and i forgot to put the bed down so i was driving down
10501840	10507200	down the street with with the bed up and i went right through an intersection and took down all
10507200	10514480	the power lines and the city was without power for for a little while so i was like you know what
10514480	10519920	i i lost my license i got demoted i was i was back down to picking up garbage for the city again
10520640	10525600	and uh it was a rough time for me for a while so i will tell you a quick story about driving
10525600	10531920	a dump truck myself so in mississippi there's very very little to do but one of my best friends
10531920	10538960	growing up uh his uh grandfather had uh basically this pit in the middle of the woods and they were
10538960	10543920	out there you know chopping down the trees like basically chopping down the forest to make a bunch
10543920	10551120	of money from it right so uh i actually learned how to pick locks in high school so we could then
10551120	10558560	open the gate and go into the sand pit and this is the same year that i learned how to make fake ids
10558560	10565520	so i was the only person in my high school class that could actually get us alcohol and i did so
10565520	10572560	we would go out there and throw these huge parties in this bonfire pit and a bunch of 16 year olds
10572560	10578320	getting drunk out of our mind and driving the wrecking ball around driving the dump truck around
10578320	10586080	while students are in the back passed out of their mind like going and uh like like cranes bulldozers
10586080	10590960	all this stuff i actually know how to operate all of that equipment because of the extremely
10590960	10597600	illegal stuff i was doing back then all right disavow all illegal activities i wag my finger
10597600	10604240	okay well is this actually limitations passed on that or yeah yeah okay yeah good because people
10604240	10609360	will sit on it and try to use it well anyway i've told this story many times president sunday's
10609360	10618400	watching you know he might true true um go ahead uh new caller i'm sorry i don't know your name i
10618400	10625280	stream things up hi you're live hey yeah it's grayboard oh i know cryborn one of my
10625440	10633120	community members hello so uh brianna i um i was hoping uh you could you could kind of
10633120	10641360	remind people what's at stake should republicans win in 2024 and why the uh left wing infighting
10641360	10648000	is so so dangerous thank you for such a great question um you know trump is an existential
10648000	10655120	threat to democracy and uh you know he's certainly going to abuse his power to uh
10655120	10661440	basically get revenge on his enemies and stop the uh rule of law from being implemented against him
10661440	10667280	uh you know he has nothing to lose he's looking at prison time so you know uh trump himself is
10667280	10673280	this existential threat to democracy additionally you know if you look at the uh fringe rightward
10673280	10679120	tilt of the court i think one of the worst things that could happen is trump uh like appointing even
10679120	10687520	more uh judges uh to the judiciary so it's really not an exaggeration to say if we don't get our
10687520	10694400	shit together and work on winning 2024 i genuinely am not sure we're still going to have a country
10695200	10700480	damn actually i have a question for you i have a question for you if you don't mind um
10701280	10707200	do you think that trump genuinely believes that he won 2020 and he's just wrong about it
10707200	10712320	or do you think that he knows he lost and he's just been coping i i don't have to surmise about
10712320	10716960	this because it's all come out in the the cases against him where he's admitted in private
10717600	10723440	people testified how he knows he lost and uh it was him just trying to keep power so don't take
10723440	10728640	my word for it take it from the people that were there um if you have those could you send them to
10729520	10734320	me i'm kind of curious yeah i'm it's very easily found but i will do that after the show
10734880	10739680	okay great whoa wow thank you getting some information answered well thanks
10739680	10744640	for being here cryborn cryborn you know i love you right love you too wick
10749520	10754560	everybody always has these cool streamer nicknames i've been thinking so much i need
10754640	10760400	my i'm just brianna right we got wick you're the wu the wu effect right we can we can the
10761680	10767200	what should mine be like i don't actually wu effect is not bad wu's warriors that could be
10767200	10773440	your uh your community name right wu fast wu furious that works too i like it i like that
10774480	10780320	uh uwu right we could do that oh there you go okay i'm probably changing my name sometime soon
10781040	10788240	it's not a great name yeah yeah i know everyone knows it's not it's not is it a metal gear
10788240	10793680	reference what i don't i've looked at that so many times i'm like what the hell uh so i started the
10793680	10798720	channel in 2009 when it was like me and my friends kind of running around my small town with a camera
10798720	10805280	and we were shooting um we were shooting anime content and the name just stuck from when i was
10805280	10811840	younger it just stuck around so like yeah you know 2009 that was the era of like channel awesome on
10811840	10815920	the internet right this was long before a lot of the nonsense we're facing now so we were like
10815920	10821120	we're gonna be anime reviewers and we're gonna make it onto doug walker's website and that was
10821120	10827760	like our big dream it didn't work out but actually i have like a bit of deep lore on that for for
10827760	10833520	anybody who cares about fucking channel awesome lore from 15 years ago um we and after the channel
10833520	10838560	got bigger we ended up applying again and they took us and then i rejected it because i just
10838560	10846160	wanted to see that i could oh fightful okay spiteful one victory i have way over thought
10846160	10852080	this that i've thought for years because you know your voice is yeah you've got like you could be a
10852080	10857680	voice actor professional voice actor you're really good at that right um and there's such a disconnect
10857680	10864640	between like short fat otaku and your voice so i'm like is this an ironic commentary is this
10864640	10868560	and i find out it's one of these situations like when you're playing somebody online
10868560	10873920	and their username is like boobs are awesome and you're like okay they were 14 when they made that
10873920	10879360	username that's that's basically what it is yeah yeah we got we got two more colors i want to be
10879360	10883520	real quick with them then we're gonna let blue off the leash here and get get her out of here
10883600	10887600	um uh but let's bring them on hello friend
10892320	10896320	why we wait for him 10 more bucks from artemis fowl if the last message about
10896320	10899840	trump being an existential threat is as important as you think it is why is trump gaining support
10899840	10905360	across the board including 20 22 of african americans now we'll answer that question later
10905360	10913120	uh but i would say it's simply uh the fact that people are tired they they view the economy as
10913120	10918480	doing poorly whether or not or not it is that's how they view the economy and i think that's
10918480	10925840	just driving things right i agree okay um okay you're here great excellent what's up
10925840	10932800	you're live hey so first off since people already know i'm in the military so any statements i make
10932800	10937280	are personal opinions are reflective of department of defense or the army anything like that got to
10937360	10942880	do which uh which place should you serve in uh i'm in the army officer thank you very much for that
10943440	10948240	no officer though oh well you guys are working i wish we had someone who worked for a living on
10948240	10957840	but go ahead okay so i'll ask uh just one short question so i'm a big fan of jonathan height
10957840	10964240	rider and elephant kind of stuff yeah so what what do you guys do to actually check
10964960	10970480	your policies and social prescriptions that you support to make sure it's not the elephant in
10970480	10976640	charge what's the elephant in charge can you help me understand that yeah yeah so okay so the basic
10976640	10983600	idea is most people are not as rational as they think they are you're primarily controlled by
10983600	10991200	instincts and emotion which is kind of like an elephant and then your rational mind is the person
10991200	10995760	riding on top of the elephant the rider thinks they're in control but the elephant just kind
10995760	11003760	of does what it does and you post hoc rationalize afterwards um i will answer this question first
11003760	11008880	if i may um and then i'll let the stars of the show go but one of the things that i personally
11008880	11014480	do to make sure that i am checking my biases making sure i'm not just knee-jerking is building
11014480	11020000	a community like this where most of my community yells at me all the time right where i'm constantly
11020000	11026800	challenged i am in a space where i have other elephants to check my elephant if that makes sense
11026800	11034080	right where i am challenged and i have we normalize being able to come to me directly and say wick
11034080	11040560	you're being stupid you're being wrong you're being um irrational that's that's what i it's
11040560	11048720	not perfect but that's that's my go-to anyway i think for me i mean earlier in the show i talked
11048720	11054800	about how reactionary i was during gamergate uh you know speaking of trauma right so i think
11054800	11060000	that's a really good example of where i failed um i can't think of any situation where i got really
11060000	11066000	really angry and posted a tweet response to that that it worked out well and i think part of the
11066000	11074720	good part of getting older is you you learn to uh to don't react that emotionally as often uh i
11074720	11079920	clearly fail at this all the time uh you know my passion is just a part of my personality
11079920	11086000	it's probably never going to go away but i think you try to surround yourself uh with uh people
11086000	11091600	you that you really value their counsel um something i think that has really been good at
11091600	11097280	helping me get the right answer dev i think it's clear from this conversation tonight i genuinely
11097280	11103360	watch your youtube channel even though i've had many criticisms of parts of that tonight right
11103360	11108960	i i do spend a lot of time watching content i don't agree with because i do think it helps me
11108960	11113360	make sure that my opinions are correct and yeah there's some stuff you've said that i've changed
11113360	11119600	my mind on and i've admitted as much but yeah i think that uh that ability to hear another side
11119600	11127040	is really really important i guess without a view it is when it comes to oh thanks by the way i do
11127040	11135040	appreciate the fluffing um when it's genuine um when it comes to um the elephant and the rider
11135920	11141440	when jonathan height lays out that example what he's basically saying is that if the elephant is
11141440	11146080	calm the rider is capable of directing the elephant in the general direction that the
11146080	11152240	rider wants to go but if the elephant is agitated the rider has no hope right and the best way you
11152240	11157680	can do that is you can make the road as clear as possible so a lot of things that you can do
11157680	11164480	to help along your own rationality is to before you get into any sort of heated debate before you
11164480	11169920	ever actually have to use those precious cycles of brain power which are quite limited per day
11170480	11175200	make sure that like your your environment is set you know make sure that your house is in order
11175200	11179280	make sure your ideas are in order make sure that you've studied you've read make sure that you
11179280	11185200	considered other things before you have to be tested on them right that that's probably the
11185200	11190720	best way that you can avoid you know that that is the best way you can avoid saying something stupid
11194000	11201040	okay okay fair enough and and before i head off i will recommend to rihanna that you should
11201040	11207840	absolutely read the righteous mind by jonathan height uh yes so yeah why isn't even this
11207840	11213680	righteous mind tell me about this the righteous mind by jonathan height that is basically his
11213680	11219040	his magnum opus it's the psychology of morality it's the six moral foundations we talked about
11219040	11224480	earlier that that is that is the and it is free on audible i'm buying it right now boom
11225360	11229440	you won't regret it thank you yeah what if i can ask what do you do in the army
11230000	11234960	yeah so uh i'm just an infantry officer so i'm not going to go into my specific job but i've done
11234960	11242880	things from platoon leader company officership s3 in the shop time so just kind of all different
11242880	11249280	kinds of jobs yeah just generally my branch is infantry thank you very much i appreciate
11249280	11255760	veterans day tomorrow right i think it is uh i think though i think we're doing free
11255760	11262400	applebees or something tomorrow but yeah uh again thanks for calling thanks for coming by and uh
11262400	11269840	we'll see you later buddy no thanks for having me on officers i was an enlisted um it's a little
11269840	11275440	bit of a different world yeah we don't have veterans day here but we have remembrance day
11275440	11280480	and it's pretty much the same thing um do americans have the tradition of wearing poppies for it or no
11281600	11287680	no i've never heard of that no um no pretty much just just uh we put a support the troops sticker
11287680	11292800	on our car and then send them off for war and then give them no health care fireworks and
11292800	11300400	barbecues fireworks yeah but listen if you're if you're ever in canada or or the uk or in australia
11300400	11304640	or new zealand there's a tradition where on november 11th which is remembrance day in these
11304640	11310320	countries everyone wears a poppy on their shirt and you can generally buy a poppy for like 25
11310320	11316080	cents at any store and all that money goes towards the military oh that's a good idea like like
11316080	11320960	veteran stuff yeah uh one last caller i'm sorry there's two and things but one came in a little
11320960	11332240	late sorry uh let's get infallible foul infallible foul you're live you're on air what is up i was
11332240	11336080	wondering about something you guys were talking about a little bit earlier and maybe that's a
11336080	11341920	little bit of bias that i have just because i'm not seeing this from a right wing perspective
11341920	11347520	but when i feel like when people talk about the right and they talk about usually the individual
11347520	11352080	like this person did this wrong this person did that but i've been hearing a lot especially in
11352080	11358000	the spit this space around here is the left has progressives have an anti-Semitic problem
11358000	11363120	i've been seeing earlier you said horseshoe theory now uh what is it do you think about
11363120	11368320	having maybe like a little bit more fiscally liberal policies would make somebody more of
11368320	11376000	a scumbag and have more about far bright extremist opinion in life i don't
11377920	11380960	that was apparently like we were talking horseshoe theory
11382080	11388240	what do you mean i don't understand what you're saying yeah rephrase sir if you can't oh wick
11388240	11394960	you're talking about horseshoe theory you had a title up that said uh the left anti-semitism
11394960	11401520	problem that is not willing so when we say the left right um it's not just oh i'm a leftist
11401520	11407520	because i have i believe in these fiscal policies and things like that the left as a term covers a
11407520	11415600	broad tent of belief structures and things like that um and this is by design um so that we can
11415600	11421840	uh coalesce and do this kind of like a cooperative action this community action in order to get
11421840	11426240	things passed so we'll put aside our differences in order to come together to fight against the
11426240	11432480	things that we think are bad and to promote the things that we think are good my whole um thing
11432480	11439360	that i have observed of late after october 7th especially is how many people are willing to
11439360	11446480	overlook anti-semitism because they believe in the oppressor versus the oppressed kind of dynamic
11446480	11455120	going on in the israeli-palestine conflict and they don't just keep their um criticism
11455120	11462640	towards the israeli state but they again talk in the most extreme terms and are willing to put up
11462640	11470320	with again just dehumanizing jewish individuals um in order to because they hate israel so much
11470320	11475360	they're willing to overlook anti-semitism and that's a problem and we need to address that
11475360	11480960	that's my i i just think there is a lot a large part of the audience that does feel like it was
11480960	11485760	kind of generalized and a lot of them were frustrated with you and i think that's that's
11485760	11492000	fair to be frustrated but they i'm frustrated with them right back because again i am not saying that
11492000	11499920	everyone on the left is anti-semitic obviously not but if we we can't pretend that there's none
11499920	11506080	and when people bring it up you can't can't get mad at it we have to clean our own house
11506080	11511360	we have to keep it in order we cannot let the cancer spread we saw what happened to the right
11511360	11516000	when the right let its crazies take over and dictate and become the elephant that drove the
11516000	11522000	rider we cannot let that happen and so we must push back excise and get rid of the people who
11522000	11529200	are cancer in our party and in our movements and there are many many many that i think are
11530240	11535600	mask on amongst us but for a brief moment on october 7th they dropped their mask and we saw
11535600	11542320	this with um not only online activity with people asking like what do you think decolonization looks
11542320	11549280	like and gang next every time i hear could be colonized that that is as a term tainted for me
11549280	11553760	forever yeah right i will never hear decolonization said in a way that doesn't
11553760	11560640	make me think oh that's what they mean right that was ugly okay so if i can take a swing at that yeah
11560640	11566560	i hear what you're saying wick um so when i know if you're a traditional republican that wants
11566560	11574560	low taxes and you know little government regulation maybe even you have a some questions about uh what
11574560	11579680	our school board policy should be and how much we're talking about like same-sex marriage stuff
11579680	11585600	like that that to me is just bread and butter normie republican stuff uh i don't have any issue
11585600	11591360	with that i want to beat you at the ballot box i don't agree with you but i think that is democracy
11591360	11596560	these are some stats this is according to the university of washington uh so this is from maga
11596560	11601120	supporters and the percentage of maga supporters according to the university of washington that
11601120	11609120	supported trump's election fraud claims was almost 98 the number of maga sports distrust the 2020
11609120	11615280	presidential election results was 97 the number of maga people that believe voting shouldn't be
11615280	11624480	easier is over 90 distrust this distrust the 2020 congressional results is almost uh 80 percent so
11624480	11630400	over and over and over again i think you're seeing this more on the right it certainly exists on the
11630400	11636080	left but there's a strain on the right of fundamentally not believing in democracy not
11636080	11642000	believing in the rule of law and seeing the opposition as an enemy in a way that you truly
11642000	11647440	want to see them destroyed not just beating them at the ballot box but you think they're so evil
11647440	11653600	that you just want to like this is why you see the national divorce and talk of the second civil war
11653600	11660080	from the right so i and what really worries me is i see the same sentiment growing on the left
11660080	11665600	part of why i'm taking this blow like professionally in calling it out is i
11665600	11669760	don't want the left to become a mirror of the right i think that would be a really dark fate
11669760	11676800	for the country any thoughts on this sfo i know it's uh yeah you're the opposition here but go
11676800	11684800	ahead well i mean you're you're characterized him as a right right away now look at that
11684800	11690000	i guess that's not what i said that's not what i said no no rick just did yeah because it's
11690000	11696160	funny but go ahead so here's the thing right like i don't remember what it was but there was
11696160	11701760	definitely something that made me feel over 10 years ago what basically you're feeling right
11701760	11708640	now brianna it's like oh there is actually some some dark evil underneath all of the good rhetoric
11708640	11713120	of the left and there is actually some serious problems here and i think anyone who ever went
11713120	11717920	through like that i'm leaving the left or i've been abandoned by the left arc which you hear
11717920	11722080	like tim pool says that about himself i think she won head might say it about herself maybe yeah
11722080	11726880	there's been like a bunch of people online who have said that i think a lot of that is it's not
11726880	11734960	that the left has has left anyone behind it's a realization that not in terms of policy because
11734960	11740560	policy is different from location to location in terms of philosophy the left actually is not
11740560	11746400	morally superior to the right and when that comes out people are kind of stunned like oh
11746960	11750800	oh okay and then then they have to go through like a moment of awakening i think
11752080	11760160	so if it's i i don't think i've ever thought we were morally i mean you gotta understand because
11760160	11765280	of my unique background like when i think about republicans i do think about all the people i
11765280	11771360	know back down home in mississippi right they're they're good people they go to church uh they are
11771360	11778960	living in society that is still very much bearing the weight this open wound of segregation in the
11778960	11783760	civil war has been largely forgotten by the rest of the country i think they are racist in ways
11783760	11792800	they don't understand i think their policies are wrong and i think we need to um to denounce that
11792800	11798480	but are they fundamentally evil people and i'm a good person i don't i've never thought that's
11798480	11804640	true right like i think people are people and i think the more time you spend like actually going
11804640	11812800	out and doing politics in the real world you'll see like there's the like i've never talked to
11812800	11818400	anyone i couldn't find something that i liked something about them right so i i don't know
11818400	11823200	i've just never seen it in that moral black and white and i think that's why what's happening to
11823200	11828080	you right now is happening yeah i've definitely met leftists both online and off who thought that
11828080	11835520	they were just superior for their beliefs yeah well that is that is a thing and it does speak
11835520	11842240	to horseshoe theory um but like i look i i've been going off on this for a while now on my show i
11842240	11846960	know people are probably tired about it but i think it's very very important that we have to
11846960	11854080	recognize our own internal issues because if we don't it's going to be a problem and it's hard i
11854080	11858720	know it's hard it's hard to recognize that the people you thought were on your side are probably
11858720	11864720	probably not on your side really um and yeah it's just a struggle we're going to write actually i
11864720	11869280	actually want to amend what i said it's not only that they think that they're superior it's a it's
11869280	11875200	that even in their superiority if it were real they have no humility about it and that's really
11875200	11879920	the killer because sometimes you do just just have a better idea right but you you have to
11880720	11884320	you have to be humble in victory and i think that's something the left has a problem with
11885200	11890320	yeah i i agree with that i think that's why you see a lot of this rhetoric where like i've been
11890320	11896480	called a genocide supporter more times today than i can even count even though i'm very strong
11897120	11903520	strongly pro-palestine i've said many times like we need to stop civilian death there right so i
11903520	11910720	certainly understand that tendency to really moralize things really really quickly so okay
11910720	11915840	and fallible owl thank you for calling in any last comment any last words comrade before we
11915840	11920640	send you to the void yeah i was just gonna say that i think that a little bit that you have to
11920640	11924320	think about because i think you they get it you look at it from a moderate perspective and you
11924320	11931680	think moderates are the good ones and no bad people from all sides moderate moderation people
11931680	11937680	moderation moderates there there's times to be radical and extreme there's time to be moderate
11937680	11942560	and you have to be able to recognize which is which um i do think that moderates tend to do
11942560	11950080	less harm overall simply by dint of their style of engaging with things but that doesn't mean that
11950080	11957440	they're right um and i'm not like people call me like a centrist but i'm not i'm solidly well on
11957440	11962240	progressive right i'm solidly left-leaning i'm not a hundred percent left-leaning but i'm pretty
11962240	11970000	close um i do i do really think that extremism is way worse in moderation though in most cases
11970880	11974960	i can set myself a little bit further left but i call out people on the left to do shit that
11974960	11978800	i don't agree with well then when they're when they're celebrating hamas in the streets i think
11978800	11985600	you should call that out brother thank you for coming on foul thanks okay um i know that you
11985600	11992800	have to go well so i'm going to give you the mic to tell people is it time who you are i mean it's
11992800	11998960	9 20 it's a three hour and 20 minute show i mean i'm i'm i'm down for i gotta read a couple more
11998960	12004000	super chats here so i'll be on for a little bit longer take your time take your time so here's
12004000	12009520	the thing just just real quickly i've been taking notes and there's probably too many things to
12009520	12014640	really go into today because there's like this is how every conversation is right like you have an
12014640	12018560	idea but then the conversation moves on and like you could have gone a different way so we should
12018560	12025120	probably do this again sometime yeah and and i just just really quickly though i i've noticed
12025120	12031120	there's like a trend with you and me on twitter where i will dig up something that is like truly
12031120	12036560	ridiculous on the left and you're like flabbergasted i mean you're like do you know what i'm talking
12036560	12042880	about yeah yeah because there's the one time where it's like hey here's an article by some random
12042880	12047200	leftist who thinks that we should abolish nuclear families because it would be better for liberation
12047200	12052400	and then see when i say things like um government should be liberal people should be conservative
12052960	12058080	i'm looking at you know the the end result of the march of progress where we're now tearing
12058080	12062240	down things that are essential and we're slandering them as conservative and tearing
12062240	12065360	things down as essential to like human life and it's like well i don't want to do that you know
12065360	12069280	i think that nuclear families are actually good you know it's good for most people to be in a
12069280	12075440	nuclear family so that's kind of where i'm coming from yeah no i get it i get it um i mean i watch
12075440	12081200	your tick tock tuesday videos they're my favorite but i think you do you don't have to watch those
12081200	12087280	they're ridiculous no but you show some stuff that's crazy and it blows my mind genuinely so
12087280	12095760	there it is okay um where where could people find you what would you if you could will like pitch
12095760	12100400	anything to my audience right now to dev's audience what would it be i get involved with
12100400	12106160	the 2024 election i'm doing a ton of work with progressive victory uh we are going to be starting
12106160	12113120	an mvp canvassing house with death with destiny very very soon i'm really excited about that
12113120	12117920	uh deep canvassing is something we've really learned in the democratic party and this is the
12117920	12124080	way it works um if you have people that are kind of embedded in the community and they're constantly
12124080	12129600	going out to you know fish fries and knocking on doors and truly getting to know people in the
12129600	12135280	community and forming those deep relationships um it doesn't just help you win one election it
12135280	12140960	helps you start to turn a whole community around and you know something steven has never gotten
12140960	12147360	credit for is his commitment to electoral politics and really making a difference i understand why
12147360	12154320	his hot takes uh uh get the most attention but i think underneath that is someone who truly
12154320	12159440	loves this country and wants to do his part so uh that's going to be coming up really soon
12159440	12164480	uh we're going to have ways for y'all to get uh involved with that so i hope that you will
12164480	12170560	this country's worth fighting for well thank you uh brianna for spending some time with us today
12170560	12175520	and we'll see you next week when we have just one thing and that's looking forward to that
12175520	12180400	and maybe uh uh deb may sometime we can play smash brothers or something on your strength

12210720	12217520	we got to keep it snappy okay efficiency okay okay that's okay um so now i have you here just
12217520	12221600	i won't keep you very much longer but i do have a question we can stay till the end i mean it's
12221600	12226400	super chats to do right yeah yeah super chats to do um but before we get to those i will ask you
12226400	12237200	this um how do you think that went um about what i thought like there's uh there was definitely
12237200	12240560	some people who were saying who were like messaging me and being like don't talk to
12240560	12246640	brianna she's a snake and i'm like you know i can kind of understand that point of view because she
12246640	12251120	was crazy 10 years ago but i've also seen her make the rounds for the like past year or so and she's
12251120	12259120	been very reasonable i do i i whatever faults she had 10 years ago that created this negative um
12259120	12264720	this negative view of her on on some parts of the internet they're they're definitely it's she's not
12264720	12271360	who she was and i kind of knew that it was going to be a much more reasonable conversation um and
12271360	12276560	it was pretty much what i expected you know no i get you i think that there's this tendency for us
12276560	12283920	to hang the worst or worst selves onto onto others like their worst selves their worst moments
12283920	12292320	and that's all they ever are um i can i can attest that through working with her right i didn't know
12292320	12295680	her very much i didn't know her at all i didn't talk to her at all during the gamergate years or
12295680	12300320	things like that probably wouldn't have um but she's always been square with me she's always
12300320	12305840	treated me fairly and i haven't seen her um do anything duplicitous or backstabby or anything
12305840	12314080	like that if there were snake times before fair enough but i don't see them now um i will say that
12314080	12321200	like she's genuine when she wants to just work with others not just because um it's just a good
12321200	12327040	thing to do and want to change but like from a pragmatic standpoint it's just it's just better
12327040	12331920	to build than to tear down it's better to build bridges like that and i think that um we're
12332160	12336480	we're working on it we're bringing her around so we'll smooth out that's a conservative point of
12336480	12342960	view wick you're not liberating things you're conserving them you know what my policies that
12342960	12351840	i advocate for um much like you're saying right are writ large for the community as a whole when
12351840	12357040	it comes to my personal stances and things like that i do believe that we are masters of our own
12357040	12363680	destiny and we need to take um accountability and responsibility for what we do and what we
12363680	12369040	put into the world and i do think that things are worth conserving i'm not i'm not progress
12369040	12375120	i'm not i'm not progressive for progress's sake there i want to progress to certain things to
12375120	12379680	certain points to certain outcomes and i don't think we need to throw the baby out with the
12379680	12386560	bath water in order to get there um there's just no need for it to tear down when we can uh reform
12386640	12391840	and rebuild but i don't know um let's ask these uh super chats real quick because
12391840	12395440	artemis fowl has been very generous and i want to make sure that he gets his money
12396080	12401680	he has that glowy money and you know what i'm here for it okay i'm here for it um ten dollars
12401680	12407120	the same side that claimed that supporting israel and jews in israel is anti-semitic but became
12407120	12412000	amazingly nuanced when it comes to hamas and the palestinians who support the killing of jews
12412000	12417680	i guess it's not a question so much but yeah it's it's one of those things where
12418960	12424240	it's it's so easy to be hypocritical because you can have like 18 million different stances and
12424240	12429360	18 million different topics and so whatever ends up serving your politics i think is what a lot of
12429360	12435120	extreme people do they will like they'll think they'll they will um you know i i gotta find that
12435120	12440320	exact jesus christ i think i think my brain's starting to melt let me find it here yeah so
12440320	12444800	basically they'll they'll claim racism when it cuts one way and they'll claim liberation when
12444800	12448480	it cuts the other way you know it's one of those things where it doesn't matter that it doesn't
12448480	12453600	make sense what only matters is that you say the two statements far enough apart from each other
12453600	12458800	that no one notices and this is this is why i'm harping on this and i know people are tired of me
12458800	12466160	harping on this but people are seeing this like we see people high profile figures have left very
12466160	12472400	leftist chapters the dsa has bleeding membership right from high profile members like there there's
12473520	12478640	october 7th has created this fissure amongst the left that i don't think we've reckoned with yet
12478640	12483120	and not just the left the rights rights the right's currently trying to to decide which
12483120	12487360	it hates more muslims or jews right and they're going to fight about that for a while but on the
12487360	12494960	left like we have this uh there there are people who thought we were going for one thing that
12495760	12502080	have realized that oh no those memes that the republicans were trying to make you into
12502080	12507040	no those are actually that's actually what you actually wanted and uh what and so we have this
12507040	12511760	kind of uh fight going on right now but we'll get through it we'll get we'll get past it hopefully
12511760	12516960	yeah um five more dollars there's nothing more delicious or decadent than to be able to hate with
12516960	12522880	a moral conscience that is currently the only thing the left offers i don't think that's true
12522960	12529920	but fair enough that's a huxley quote quote it is uh well a bastardized huxley quote he didn't
12529920	12535680	talk about the left but fair enough yeah okay is there anything um that you thought we should
12535680	12541840	have gotten to that we didn't get to tonight my entire list of things well fair enough fair
12541840	12546960	enough maybe like something like was there any like elephants in the room that we didn't tackle
12546960	12553600	that you like wick i can't believe you didn't bring up this um no i don't think so i don't
12553600	12558240	think so i mean a lot of everything was brought up it's just that i probably had more to say on
12558240	12562400	a topic but then it kind of moved on it's like oh well that's how it is that's how it is sometimes
12562960	12569360	um two dollars from testicle johnson vote vivek 2024 um thank you for the two dollars okay um
12569360	12575200	and if there's nothing else though i mean dev looks like a professional smash player that's one
12575200	12580880	of them oh there you go two dollars from artemis valley i'm looking at him i do need to get better
12580880	12584640	at reading these things i need to figure out like either a time where like in the middle of the
12584640	12589440	discussion we can pause i can just read them all or at the end or something but people want to
12589440	12593440	people want to get their question into the discussion and so i've been trying to
12593440	12596960	figure out the best way to integrate it it's a struggle but we'll get through it there's
12596960	12601840	definitely like it's good to like have breaks or like minutes where you go to the washroom or
12601840	12605360	something and you start checking out the super chats something like that that's pretty normal
12605360	12611760	i think fair enough okay um well thank you for coming on today is there anything uh you want
12611760	12618320	to say before i let you go um i don't think so okay i mean your honor agreed to talk again and
12618320	12623600	we can always talk again i just i will absolutely reach out to you and uh have you on again for a
12623600	12634000	variety of ideas so i have on my calendar for some reason wick 15 november 15 did you give me
12634000	12641040	a date for anything if i have i'm gonna have to check my messages i document all the things that
12641040	12646160	i invite people to so i'll have to look do you have anything going on in the 15th no but the
12646160	12652000	16th is when no opinion comes on so okay maybe this is just an aspirational thing that you wanted
12652000	12655680	to come on the 15th for i don't know what i'm doing oh you know what it might have been
12655680	12659840	there was that there was that one person on twitter what's their what's their name i don't
12659840	12664240	remember yeah but they wanted to talk but then like it kind of like fell apart maybe that's what
12664240	12669840	it was um yeah i look if we still want that to happen i know that you're tagging me all the time
12669840	12674640	to bring people on to fight you it's fun i'm just like no i could still make that one happen that
12674640	12680480	one is something that i can make happen i just don't like they on talking to them i don't know
12681440	12688160	precisely what the issue is like with carl max i knew what you guys were going to talk about right
12688160	12694160	um with this one i don't i think she just doesn't like you i i think i think it would be a bog
12694160	12699680	standard socialism is better conversation fair enough and i think even as somebody who's not
12699680	12703840	a debater i think that would i could just like kind of walk through that and just be like yep
12703840	12708480	here it is yep yep but yeah i'll uh if you want i'll uh reach out to that and see if they can make
12708560	12713440	me happy i know sunday's been desperately trying to get you on from anything but uh
12713440	12720720	it's funny to watch you tell him no so yeah i just here i know he's listening i understand
12721600	12727920	here here's your your one drop of attention here you go but you know in terms of i think
12727920	12732000	her name was jaylen or something um i mean like i'm interested in talking to her it's always fun
12732000	12736960	okay because but i think it wouldn't be a fruitful conversation i think it would be rehashing why
12737040	12741680	socialism sucks and then coping and then it would be like okay well there we go those can be fun
12741680	12748480	and those can be uh look we go through the the the what the the standards the classics if you will
12748480	12752800	of debates right like there's certain types of content that will always draw views they're
12752800	12758720	evergreen um are women bad in the various forms gets a lot of attention gets a lot of views right
12760240	12764080	you know socialism versus capitalism that's another one that gets a lot of attention a lot
12764080	12769280	of views so there's these uh these evergreen topics we can always make it work uh people
12769280	12774880	are asking are you going to stream are you going to start doing streaming uh no they're they're
12774880	12778880	asking me if i'm going to do my gaming stream oh so here's the thing here's the thing whenever i
12778880	12783120	fire up fiber politics stream because i'm not i'm not a consistent streamer like like everyone
12783120	12786720	else in twitch poll i don't i do not do that sort of thing i've thought about it like streaming
12786720	12792000	every day for twitch poll but i don't know i don't know if that's that's me right but um
12792560	12798560	i do stream once a week like a weekly news show on sunday and whenever i stream that lowest point
12798560	12803280	i get like 200 viewers highest point i get like a thousand so i can do pretty good for myself as a
12803280	12810720	streamer i think very cool when i stream video games i get between like 20 and 50 those are
12810720	12817200	wick numbers right there but now it's it's that's great but like the the core viewers love that
12817200	12820000	shit they love the gaming streams and they're always tuning in and they're
12820560	12825200	so the ones who ask me dev where are you are you streaming tonight dev it's always like that core
12825200	12829520	audience and they're the ones who want the the smaller like intimate streams and they ask me
12829520	12834720	like every night every night what i'm doing probably not tonight guys i think i think this
12834720	12839360	ran too late and also i was working on uh i was hoping to get the next video out today it's
12839360	12844240	probably going to be tomorrow at this rate but i was working on that all day so i don't i think
12844240	12851120	basically um i'm doing the archcast tomorrow afternoon so i'll either stream some gaming
12851120	12855920	stuff either before or after the archcast tomorrow i think okay well with that gang
12855920	12861600	we're gonna let you go remember monday we're gonna have the mental illness stream with uh
12861600	12868080	xena cherry and pixie um tuesday will be food stamps versus admiral gibbs and then thursday
12868080	12873680	will be noah opinion with brianna woo and sdl um so if you guys want to see that kind of content
