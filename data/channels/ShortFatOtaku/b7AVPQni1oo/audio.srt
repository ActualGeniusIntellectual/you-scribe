to the serious and gang we have a show for you today. Many moons ago, years ago, mortal enemies

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,920
a battlefield littered with rhetorical corpses and champions on either side standing strong

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,880
eyeing each other across a moonlit field swords at the ready blood staining everything they did

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:43,200

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,520
bit behind so yeah i'll real quickly i'll tweet out that this is happening beautiful thank you

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:00,080
thank you um but yeah i wanted to just kind of get um get the temperature check just in general

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,800
i know that there's been a lot of really heavy discourse of late online um and in spaces so i

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,840
just wanted to make sure like how how are we feeling uh brianne you privated a bunch of your

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,440
stuff today what what happened i i'm just tired of getting yelled at by my own sidewalk and it's

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,640
not more complicated than that though i never privated my twitter even during gamer gate and

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,280
that's just how bad it's been lately um yeah there's nothing to it it's just um yeah i think

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,320
it's and dev i i don't know how you feel but i think it's really clear that a portion of my own

25
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:44,240
movement has uh certainly been engaged in apologia for uh you know october 7th and uh i've tried to

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,440
push back on that even though i stand with you know the palestinian people and uh it's just

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,320
really been uh really unpleasant lately um so i've just i've had enough that's it

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,040
here to be alive be with us i'm posting the final message okay okay let's let him get his tweet out

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,320
i i've just annoyingly added everyone in my discord that'll work well thank you i appreciate it

30
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,160
yeah no problem no problem um but um to that right um you've been watching this from afar

31
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,720
i've seen you tweet on it i've seen you reply to posts and things dev what what is your take on

32
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
this whole situation on ocuber 7th like the israel no on the uh the discourse surrounding it to be

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,560
clear right um it's cancerous yeah i expect that from the internet at this point to be honest

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,440
i've i've seen so many so many news cycles where people will take the most extreme

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,400
version of events push it just outside the realm of truth so that people who agree with them still

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,080
still hold on to it because it's still somewhat truthful and then they just roll with they just

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
run with the narrative right like i've seen right wingers do this with a whole bunch of things

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,200
concerning trump i've seen left wingers do this with the whole like for for the past 10 years

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,320
discourse has been a nightmare online in my opinion i'm old enough to remember what it was

40
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,640
like before i think it was it was still bad 10 years ago i think it was bad 15 years ago

41
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,280
i think it is definitely getting worse um but i think part of that is you know when you and i

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,480
were growing up deaf and i assume we're roughly the same age because the music from your videos

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,400
is like parasite eve and final fantasy 8 so i just assume you love those for the same reasons i do

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,000
i grew up in the 90s yeah yeah yeah i mean the the the normies just were not online it was only

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,480
people like us so i think that the addition to the uh to the cool kids has uh really made the

46
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,360
internet a much worse place to be it used to just be uh yeah um sexism and now it's terrorist

47
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:51,040
apology so that's not good ah there was i know there were definitely some real sexist back in

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
the day but there was also a lot of joking around too yeah sometimes sometimes it was hard to tell

49
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,720
the difference between the two but uh yeah things have gotten worse for sure yeah definitely i guess

50
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:09,200
on that note right like of back in the day um i guess i'll just ask this to you first brianna

51
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,120
and i'm curious what dev would have to say uh i'm again as i alluded to before there were a lot of

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,000
well we've we've had a lot on online presence for a long time um how do you feel you've grown since

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,440
then and in what ways right oh boy that's a long question well we got a long time i set aside two

54
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,360
hours for y'all we gotta talk about something right well i think you one of the thing the

55
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,840
things is the older you get um i i think that if you do it correctly you're you're constantly

56
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,200
changing and growing and you you take in new information i don't think that's true for everyone

57
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,120
i think that some people uh get really static the older that they get but for me you know i i think

58
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,640
you keep i think you keep adding new information and hopefully like ending up at better answers um

59
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,400
i think for me personally one way i've grown is just getting more and more and more over the

60
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,640
trauma of my childhood which makes me less reactive uh though i can certainly be reactive

61
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:22,480
but um not being in that fight or flight mode all the time um is certainly helpful um i i think that

62
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,200
one of the really big changes in me personally today versus the gamergate era is i've seen

63
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,880
like jessabelle just closed yesterday who was a huge force in the gamergate years i love jessabelle

64
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,880
i love most of the writers at jessabelle and i think like the the financial collapse of that

65
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,800
particular business model you know part of it is due to mismanagement by uh the private equity

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:58,240
firm that bought them out but i also think part of it is we have the tactics of feminism that

67
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,600
we've employed for the last 10 15 years are clearly not resulting in a vibrant movement

68
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,560
it's not resulting in more real world rights um it's not resulting in a conversation about what

69
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,280
women are facing and i think for me personally the biggest lesson i've taken is that internet

70
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,160
screaming does not really equate to real world policies if that makes sense oh that makes sense

71
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,080
to me right like do we have to ask ourselves like is what we're doing moving us towards what we want

72
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,440
or is it moving us away or is it just like making us shred water um i i've seen a lot of posts and

73
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,600
this is kind of not a non-soc whatever a little bit of an aside of people who are swearing they're

74
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,480
never going to vote for joe biden right they're like oh i will never vote for genocide joe is that

75
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,160
what the term they use like and then the question you ask is like well considering that you want

76
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,080
policies that genocide joe will support and the other options will not what what do you think

77
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,280
you're accomplishing here is this moving you closer to your political objectives or is it

78
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,000
moving you further away and i think we all kind of have to ask that but i want to isn't just well

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,440
hold on because this will piggyback into dev you know dev one of the reasons i enjoy your videos is

80
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,040
i think um and before people online scream at me i do think you come up with a lot of things are

81
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,040
structurally are wrong with the directions that progressives are going that's not to say i agree

82
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,800
with the conclusion she reached but i think you've really put your finger on some of the things that

83
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,240
are wrong with our movement today and one of those are the purity spiral that you have an excellent

84
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,760
video about and the utopianism that we kind of fall into so i would love to hear like from your

85
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,880
point of view how you feel about that well i mean i'm not a progressive right i don't view myself

86
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:01,280
aggressive so you're not no no like i'm glad we got that settled i was curious right i

87
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,080
i view myself as like an adam and sitch style enlightened centrist you know i definitely do

88
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,400
not like the right wing there are some serious problems on on the right i grew up with the right

89
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,920
wing trying to censor video games and and wanting to repress gay people and i didn't like any of

90
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,400
that when i was when i was younger um and i think because the right wing was so ascendant in the 90s

91
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,040
at least culturally um it was easy to be a leftist it was easy to be like a cent like maybe not

92
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,040
not like a communist or anything but it was easy to be like you know why shouldn't we have health

93
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,320
care i mean we have health care in canada but why shouldn't america have health care right why

94
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,560
shouldn't we have gay marriage these were kind of easy they're like slam dunks for people who are

95
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,280
left-leaning right um but the slam dunks are kind of drying up and now you have tougher questions

96
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,400
on the left and the answers to those questions aren't exclusively leftist because because now

97
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,240
you're getting into like more esoteric things like you know should trans women compete in

98
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,800
women's sports that's not a slam dunk it's a complicated question there's a lot in there

99
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,800
you know so i think i think the reason that there has been a slow shift away from broader leftism

100
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,520
is because it accomplished a lot it accomplished a lot of good but we're kind of running out of the

101
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,640
good we're not we haven't completely run out of it but we've but it's definitely starting to run out

102
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,920
of good stuff out of the on on that note like what would you say currently in 2023 today is the

103
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,000
what should progresses in your opinion be putting out there what do you think is their strongest

104
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,520
argument that they have today right what should they be focusing on right now yes uh health care

105
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,720
yeah american needs health care yeah that is that is the big one um oh and you talked about

106
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,440
utopianism and purity spiraling brianna i'll give you a concrete example okay so

107
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,080
you see a lot um a lot of rhetoric on the left they see that they say they're very far left is

108
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,040
you know health care is a human right everything should be free everything should be available to

109
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,040
everyone otherwise you are oppressing people and you're letting people die you're killing people

110
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,680
in fact um in practical terms what we've discovered looking at like the uk's health

111
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,600
care system and france's and canada's health care system what we've discovered is that if you make

112
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,160
everything free you have a shit ton of waste there's and you don't you only have so much

113
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,680
resources to go around there's so many doctors only so much time so if you make everything free

114
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,840
you end up bankrupting your system you can't like it's it's fucked however if you add like a 20

115
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,840
copay to go to the doctors you cut out like 90 of the waste because most people who are just showing

116
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,360
up to like get a day off work and get a doctor's note they're not going to do that because it's

117
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,600
not free anymore right so the the i these numbers are i got them from econoboi like a year ago i

118
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
can't pull them up right away but i do remember them as being mostly accurate is that basically

119
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,800
if you add a 20 copay you cut out 90 of your health care waste um in terms of like people

120
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,600
actually like health care waste from from patients so that's that's not ideologically pure

121
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,520
if you're talking about health care as a human right like if that's your value well now it's not

122
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,760
a human right now it costs twenty dollars which means that if somebody doesn't have twenty dollars

123
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,600
if they're too poor and they no one can lend them twenty dollars and they can't get a job

124
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,840
well that person is fucked they're not going to get health care but it also means that you get to

125
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,200
have a health care service for everyone else right so there's certain instances where if you're

126
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,640
ideologically pure you actually end up with worse results than if you compromise and i think health

127
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,160
care is one of those yeah i i certainly agree with that i think that there's that trend across

128
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,480
the board right like we're seeing it right now i think uh really hyperbolically with with with the

129
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,360
israel hamas war and the rhetoric around that you know if you have a stance that is yeah i did to

130
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,400
our wic panel the other night and i said multiple times like i stand with the people of palestine

131
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,720
the human rights abuses towards uh civilians is unconscionable i don't support it our top like

132
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,800
foreign policy in this region should be to you know stop the violence uh but if you don't

133
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,920
leap to the most extreme conclusion there like a one-state solution and like implementing a

134
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,640
democratic utopia there and taking away the borders uh you are just uh you don't have a voice

135
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,480
in the conversation so i agree with you on that yeah dev i do want to say in like tonight i hope

136
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,920
we can just have a respectful back and forth about some of your content i was studying a lot

137
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,360
of your videos which again largely i enjoy they're well produced they're well thought out i think that

138
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,160
this is stuff the left needs an answer for i've noticed though that there's a really big difference

139
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,760
in how you define progressives and is i define progressives depending what the argument is

140
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,920
you're trying to make there's one i was watching and yeah you define progressives in this nice

141
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,600
people that want health care but as like antifa antifa and self-id like trans people you know

142
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,040
they're non-binary and just want to make it up on the fly right so i think like one of the the

143
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,720
things i find sometimes difficult about your content is it it sometimes feels like you have

144
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,560
a conclusion that you want to reach that both sides are equally bad and you kind of reach for

145
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,680
facts that fit that and i don't always think it's an accurate way to to view a situation

146
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,080
well how do you define progressives then what's your view of it i have a much more charitable

147
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,400
point of view on this right uh which is it is i think the highest level progressivism is about

148
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,840
wanting structural um change for solutions like health care is a really good example

149
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,240
um you know i grew up in mississippi so when i think about structural racism in the united states

150
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,720
um i realize there's no policy around the edges that's gonna you know make that society heal from

151
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,960
the the wounds still open today from the civil war so i think at the highest levels like

152
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,680
progressivism is about thinking about big structural policy changes what i you and i

153
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,240
i think agree on is that there's a real tendency especially online to reformat to mean this

154
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,920
extremely online kind of argument that tends towards a purity spiral which is not helpful

155
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,280
that's true but it is um it's not just online but i think it it comes out online because it's it's

156
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,280
so easy right i think you know twitter is no longer 240 characters or whatever it was but

157
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,840
it was for a very long time and i think that promoted a certain type of very uh very short

158
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,960
thinking where you could you have to fit it into a very small box and people did that for a decade

159
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,720
and now we have a bunch of short thinkers if that makes sense especially if you're like like a

160
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,400
twitter addict or you're a journalist or something i think i think twitter ruined a lot of people's

161
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,600
brains i think that's part of it yeah um but but the bigger the bigger problem i think i'm gonna

162
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,040
have to i'm gonna have to do a bit of philosophizing unfortunately go ahead which i i did i did with

163
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,560
the carl max debate as well just to explain a few things so there's um there's a a leftist

164
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,440
philosopher named herbert marcus and he came up with this idea and he it's called it's not called

165
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,160
the march of progress but we'll just use march of progress as a shorthand and the idea basically

166
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,680
is that if you have and he thought this is a good thing he was promoting this i don't think it's a

167
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,720
good thing if you have a movement that is based on change and then you kind of universalize that

168
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,720
so so that it's it simply pursues change it inevitably radicalizes and drives off a cliff

169
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,200
it has to because it's not it's not aiming at a goal it's aiming at change itself so it's like

170
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,160
if you say i want to change to do xyz that's one thing but if you're saying i want to change for

171
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,920
changes sake then that's where the utopianism comes from and the purity spiraling and he

172
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,200
outlined this all in a book called repressive tolerance where the idea is that tolerance in

173
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:07,200
his view had to repress um people who weren't tolerant right well this is where i think i would

174
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,840
like one of the reasons the way like my views on what women are facing in america have not

175
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,240
changed since gamergate what has changed radically is the way i go about trying to

176
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,800
like affect that change right because i agree with you like at some point um you know we turned

177
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,920
a corner in how we are talking about what women face in american society and we stopped talking

178
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,360
about policies and we started talking more about an aesthetic where if you had the right

179
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,880
like points of view and the expanded feminism to mean you know body shaming and you know this this

180
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,080
this very wide gamut of related struggles where you had to kind of identify with all of these

181
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,520
values and then eventually hopefully you could talk about the policy um i think this is where

182
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,920
feminism really fucked up frankly in the gamergate era if i could do anything and go relive those

183
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,440
years over again i would have gotten off of twitter and i would have used the political

184
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,680
capital i had in that moment to push microsoft push activision to like change their internal

185
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:27,280
hiring processes right um and and i think that we've really gotten to a point where

186
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,320
feminism as a force is not going to be effective until we take a step back and go hold on what are

187
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,080
the issues we need to be thinking about uh child care is completely unaffordable women have been

188
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,280
run out of the workforce post-covid we're not really seeing an investment in that until we

189
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,800
look at these kind of bigger structural issues i don't see us like becoming relevant force in

190
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:58,400
politics again one thing that i noticed in your answers here from both of you right

191
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:07,120
um when uh dev asked you what is progressivism what who is progressive etc uh and then also

192
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,200
from dev's uh philosophizing there i think i've kind of had a a bit of a eureka moment and bear

193
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:24,080
with me right um in my mind woo right progressivism from your uh definition what you gave to me

194
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,840
is progress towards a goal right but it should be it is not but what but what a lot of progressives

195
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,440
and what i've seen this argument online before right is that we are going to progress for

196
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,200
progress's sake like we are going to move forward right regardless of where that is we are going to

197
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,520
move forward we have to move past capitalism we have to move past these things we have to move

198
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,080
forward right and i think that um sometimes at least in the sfo videos i've seen that is the

199
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,480
that is the uh what progressives are painted as and i don't think those that's that's a fair

200
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,200
characterization dev right i think that like yes there's some of that um and i think that's mostly

201
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,680
online stuff but i do think that plenty of progressives plenty of people who who do identify

202
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,840
as progressives are towards specific goals um does that make sense how am i off my rocker here

203
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,680
that does make sense but i'm not sure it's entirely accurate i mean there's there's some

204
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,720
accuracy there i think but considering how much blowback you've been receiving recently brianne

205
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,560
you have to know that there's definitely not just a small radical online fringe but a significant

206
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:46,400
number of people who now believe this way yeah i i completely agree uh and i've you know we've

207
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,680
talked about this privately in dms i don't mind sharing it here but you know i i personally

208
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,840
believe that the left is just 10 years behind the right as far as being radicalized on the internet

209
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,320
right i think a lot of the same tendencies we see in the tea party uh have now come to our own

210
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,160
doorstep um i think this version of the democratic party unfortunately would be very susceptible to

211
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,600
uh you know a left-wing donald trump if a figure like that came along so i i agree with you i think

212
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,520
there's time to stop it and you know wick one of the reasons i consider you a good friend at this

213
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,880
point is i think i think we have i have a different i think the degree to which i think women are not

214
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,120
getting a fair shake in society is a little different than yours i think we have a different

215
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,000
appraisal there but directionally i think we both see this torrent of crazy on both sides and we're

216
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,040
taking a step and saying this needs to be about policy we've got to calm this down and we've got

217
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,080
to learn to talk to each other so we can have a functioning democracy you know i very much agree

218
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,400
with you about that so does that make sense to you dev i think so yeah yeah um to go back to what you

219
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,520
were saying earlier you mentioned that um basically progressives have been making less progress as the

220
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,600
radicalizations happened right yeah um you probably don't agree with my characterization of this but

221
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,280
i'm going to give it anyway please um i think that there was a lot of um of things that needed to be

222
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,360
fixed and the feminists fixed a lot of them not all of them but they fixed a lot of them over

223
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,280
let's say the past 100 years or so there's been a lot of improvement um and then as the the number

224
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:33,040
of things to fix began to dry up you started to see them focus on on small things right micro

225
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,120
aggressions body shaming like you mentioned you know think things that weren't nearly as important

226
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,120
as should women be allowed to hold jobs and vote you know much smaller things and then as they

227
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,120
focused on the smaller things um they radicalized they became a lot more crazy looking to the normies

228
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,400
and then while they were in that that echo chamber they started taking big l's like with roe v wade

229
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,600
yeah and and like the rollback of lgbt acceptance so i think i think there's been this um this ebb

230
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,840
and flow where as the left the broader left has been accomplishing goals they've run out of goals

231
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,400
to accomplish and which has radicalized them then they became crazy then they started rolling back

232
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,160
they started losing all those goals they had accomplished so i understand that these things

233
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,200
happened at the same time dad but my question to you would be like are and i want you to be

234
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,120
clear here are you blaming that um that niche kind of focus that the left has had on the micro

235
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,360
aggressions and the small things as to why they lost roe v wade and as to why they've taken big

236
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,120
l's when it comes to lgbtq processes of protections and stuff is that are you are you

237
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,640
implying that there is a causation factor there i think there partially is yes i mean obviously

238
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,480
another part of it is that they have political opponents who want to roll those things back and

239
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,440
they took that opportunity right but they they made themselves weak they gave them the opening

240
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,680
you know i i hear what you're saying and i'm not going to deny there's a lot of that that's going

241
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,400
on i i definitely think so i i think and you talked about this in your video about the purity

242
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,960
spiral right uh which is excellent i hope we can leave that in the show notes and people will check

243
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,240
it out i think if you're on the left thank you very much dev has a very good analysis of a real

244
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,600
problem that we have um but even in your own video you talk about how this is advantageous for us to

245
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,560
build a coalition but in the end is kind of a cancer that eats us apart right so i think i

246
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,800
think that's exactly what happened right this started with us kind of all getting together

247
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,840
and going hey you know we've all noticed that our sexual assault claims are being kind of

248
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,160
systematically not being taken seriously i think women across a wide variety of fields look around

249
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,480
at the workplace and go you know what i have a lot of trouble being taken seriously and being

250
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,240
heard on my own teams right or as soon as i have a child i've noticed that my my my job is very

251
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,000
eager to show me a door right this is a set of problems that we've certainly not solved and we're

252
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,040
nowhere near solving what i think has happened is i think online is a trap particularly for people

253
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,880
you know i want to be really clear i fell into this trap i i look back at my own congressional

254
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,200
run and i think if i understood the things i do today i think i would have had a much better shot

255
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,800
of winning because what i can look back and see really clearly was online was pushing me to take

256
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:41,280
this this leftmost view on literally everything you know sex work not accepting you know money

257
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:49,280
from xyz and really focusing on the superficial when what i needed to be doing was spending a lot

258
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,160
more time in my district and talking about the policies like directly affecting their lives and

259
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:01,120
that's something i would do very differently today online i think is a trap because i think it it

260
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,200
gives people this feeling that they're they're making a change and i think it's with the best

261
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:15,360
of intention you know um yeah i'm not uh i'm not like a fat person but i can really imagine that

262
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,840
like feeling degraded all the time or feeling the ways that like society doesn't respect you i would

263
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,960
imagine there's some anger and some trauma there and i think it probably feels good to talk about

264
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,360
that online the problem is somewhere along the line like the problem is with online culture

265
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,480
there's no point where we pause and say okay we need to make it so um you know people that are

266
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:48,080
larger can access trains and planes with a little bit more dignity right there's not a public policy

267
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,480
component that we're pushing for as much as the fringe left loves to shit on liberals i do think

268
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,520
this is something structurally liberals are better at than progressives kind of forming coalitions

269
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,920
and trying to get specific policies passed well insofar as the fat thing is concerned as a fat guy

270
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
i'm quite how dare you speak over one of the oppressed classes

271
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:21,200
briano we have a fat man i apologize okay i i will say that like being fat's just unhealthy

272
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,160
and i think rather than like it it is better to promote public health than it is to promote

273
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,040
you know accommodating people being fat i think we want people to lose weight not feel comfortable

274
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:37,360
being being fat if that if that makes sense yeah i agree with that um but i also yeah this is

275
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,560
something i saw like when i was running for office i do think that there are situations where i don't

276
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,240
think it would kill airlines to have a few larger seats that are given for priority for people that

277
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,960
physically can't fit in those seats that doesn't seem crazy to me right um maybe maybe the main the

278
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,040
fat thing is a bad example there are any number of like reasonable public policy things we could

279
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,680
be focused on and we just don't because the conversation is so much about uh like online

280
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,520
purity here's a really good example uh the trans debate you know if you put me in charge tomorrow

281
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,000
of like talking about the the trans public policy um you know issue i would try to find something

282
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,920
very similar to gay marriage where like you're focused on a single public policy position with

283
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,480
a broad possible range of support and i would make that like the rights of trans children to

284
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:40,080
attend public school um but instead it gets into like this more esoteric thing and this more

285
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,720
esoteric thing which often i agree with but i also understand how it's not ever going to be a

286
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,800
popular public policy position and i think all of this is a trap i think if we're serious about

287
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,640
things like health care and trans dignity and women's rights we've got to come up with a new

288
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,520
strategy because any honest look at where the progressive movement is today you have to admit

289
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:13,120
we have less cultural power today than we did a decade ago to you brianna right yeah you say this

290
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:21,280
but the implications are are weird at that if the online is a trap does that not at least

291
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,640
imply or infer that we should simply seed the field leave online to be do online things right

292
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,600
and just leave it alone i think you and i could both agree and i think sfo might back us up that

293
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,080
the online and how that uh plays out does have real world implications it does impact not only

294
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,200
policy right but people's individuals lives as well like there are countless examples that we

295
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,440
can point to of people being harassed stalked etc and also of policies that have been either

296
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,440
implemented because of discourse that has started online or prevented from going through and or uh

297
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,920
swift voted because of uh that's an old term uh because of online discourse right um

298
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:14,320
like if online's a trap it's not a trap we can avoid is it i i've talked so much def go ahead

299
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,880
i hmm i don't know how to how to answer that actually because i had a brainwave about a

300
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,440
previous thing you were saying brianna and that was occupying my head i'm sorry wick no it's okay

301
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,600
do your brainwave thing we can ignore wick we can we can just play as video games and make money off

302
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
i will say wick i will say that like um i don't think you can ignore the online space

303
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,760
because you have uh people who are more left-leaning complaining about harassment

304
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,080
all the time and there's there's some faked harassment but there's a lot of real harassment

305
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,120
but then you also have people on the right who complain about getting cancelled and that

306
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,560
definitely happens too people have lost their jobs they've been de-banked they've had their

307
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,440
social media shut down i'm gonna make a prediction for you there's going to be a left-wing

308
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,120
resurgence in believing in cancel culture after uh after a month or two right like i think in the

309
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,800
next couple months we're gonna we're gonna hear a you and cry of people decrying people losing

310
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,080
their jobs for their political opinions i am guaranteeing that but go ahead yeah yeah yeah

311
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,360
absolutely i know um for example kraut if you know kraut and t he recently said that in germany

312
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
a whole bunch of migrants who had showed up from the middle east and now there's things

313
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,680
stuff about israel they're getting they're getting deported because germany is very strict with its

314
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,160
its jewish laws for obvious reasons right so there's a whole bunch of people who are just

315
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,960
getting kicked out of germany now and so i do think there's going to be some sort of a backlash

316
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,160
with people who are going very mask off on these on the israel-palestine situation and losing their

317
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,040
jobs and suddenly it'll be like you can't cancel people over over your political beliefs and it's

318
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,960
like well listen that's been happening for for years now to people who are right-leaning so

319
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,040
i like i don't want anyone canceled either like either side right but if these are the rules of

320
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:05,200
the game this is how it has to be you know i mean i i i don't have an issue with someone

321
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,480
losing i i i don't think i have the same position over what y'all do i mean dev you have a video

322
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,720
where you talk about uh the woman uh with the wig pulling right and how you didn't support uh

323
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,160
i think the name of the video is uh what is it cancel culture is totalitarian or something like

324
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,400
that and you're talking about this woman that basically uh this drunk white guy uh sees her

325
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,560
on the street tries to pull her wig off uh in a really violent way clearly hurts her and uh she

326
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,520
happens to film it and the guy ends up fired you're talking how you you don't support that

327
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:48,160
um i actually don't really have a problem with that necessarily what i do have a problem with is

328
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,040
and this is where i expect to get yelled at after this show is i have been against a certain set of

329
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:02,320
tactics from the gamer gate era right i think it is wrong to dox people i think it's wrong to go

330
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,920
through everything they've ever said publicly or privately and then try to use that to destroy

331
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,840
their reputation i think death threats rape threats all that stuff should just be off the table

332
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:21,200
right um and i want to be really honest and say that a decade ago i think gamer gate was doing

333
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,840
that and i would imagine all three of us would probably agree today the people i personally see

334
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:34,080
doing this the most are my own side and it just seems so crazy hypocritical of me that we decried

335
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,240
all these tactics and now we've just embraced them as our core strategy does does that kind of make

336
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:48,160
sense yep yep that's um uh fuck what was his name was it saw linsky i don't know the guy who wrote

337
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,960
rules for radicals you wrote this book basically outlining what radical movements should do to take

338
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,480
power and one of them one of the rules is just be as hypocritical as possible yeah do do the

339
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,960
underhanded stuff and also accuse your opponents of doing it you know right so it's this is kind

340
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:10,560
of how radical movements go as they radicalize but i mean you can't this is where i'm really torn a

341
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,120
lot of the time because i do agree with the political the stated political goals of the

342
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:23,600
progressive movement right uh you know i do want more acceptance for trans people i do want things

343
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,920
to be better for women i do you know i've been on a wick panel before talking about my belief in

344
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,000
like structural reparations for you know black people i think it's the only way we can move

345
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,440
forward from the pain of the civil war so when it comes to a lot of these policies i'm right there

346
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,480
on board where i'm feeling increasingly homeless is there is a standard i try to hold myself to

347
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,760
professionally and how i behave and i just see a lot of my own side engaged in tactics it just

348
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,880
i i don't know how to say it other than they feel evil to me to both of you and this is a very good

349
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,120
question because i think we've both acknowledged or all of us have acknowledged that it's worse

350
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,720
now right than it was 10 years ago it's worse value was 10 15 years ago um again i'm i'm a

351
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,680
little older myself right and i was i was active online in the early 2000s and things like that

352
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,840
very different very different environment for better or worse right there there's some things

353
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,840
i don't want back from those days um however you don't want the xbox live chats back look

354
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,280
we had some uh we had some fun times but those times are behind us um yeah uh we have grown up

355
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,280
and grown out of those things um but i will ask well should we and how do we do so and that's my

356
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,880
question is because it's it's very easy to get black pilled on this like these doxing

357
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,720
tactics these um these just doubling down taxes this constant harassment it's been shown to work

358
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,480
right it's been shown to be effective in getting the people you don't want to to be around not be

359
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,600
around anymore it hasn't worked when it came to combating our ideas getting policies passed any

360
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,840
of that but it's worked for what i think people really like and that's hurting others um so how

361
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:15,840
do we how do we get passes can't we get passes is it is there a way to stop this spiral as i

362
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,680
guess you'd call it or this uh this constant wave of tit for tat of reciprocal radicalization of

363
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,520
if you use those tactics we're going to use those tactics 10 times as hard etc etc

364
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,080
uh what what do we think i want dev to go first on this one and then i'll let you go

365
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,160
oh man how do you how do you fix the problem that's uh that's a very if we're going to talk

366
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,240
about the problem we gotta talk about how to fix it right yeah yeah um you have to

367
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,720
it's it's a tall order not everyone's gonna be able to do it you have to be able to understand

368
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,680
your your opponent's arguments all right you have to understand that like when a conservative

369
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,640
you know expresses some sort of anti-trans opinion he doesn't actually want to kill all

370
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,440
trans people and how you know how have the streets run red with the blood of trans people and

371
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,480
outlaw no he's generally scared for his kids right and now you can think that it's wrong

372
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,400
for him to be scared for his kids in that way and there's some good evidence that he probably

373
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,600
is wrong but it's not it's not coming from a place of of evil right and there's also there's

374
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,520
obviously inverted situations as well where like right wingers do not understand leftist point of

375
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,160
views leftists don't understand right wing point of views um basically if you can't steal man your

376
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,640
opponent's arguments you're you're not going to be able to sympathize with them when they

377
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
have an emotional reaction to something that they think is bad

378
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,080
so being able to steal men or wanting to steal but the problem is dev no one wants to do that

379
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:53,520
i well i can't make them i mean so so there's this idea um like pre-internet you watch what was on

380
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,400
tv maybe you could like rent a movie but like you watch what was on tv i would have never grown to

381
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,280
love um to love martial arts films if i didn't watch them at 3 a.m by like sneaking downstairs

382
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,600
as a kid right it was the only thing on um and i i had i think from 16 to 18 i had an

383
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,440
insomnia so i couldn't sleep and i was just staying up all night watching these martial arts films

384
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,160
because that's all i could do right um it's one of those things where as technological

385
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,160
advancement has increased and we have more access to netflix for example we never have

386
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,760
to be exposed to anything we don't like ever again which is nice because we don't want to

387
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,120
interact with things that we hate but also it means that we never actually discover anything new

388
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,920
so if you take that principle you apply it to political echo chambers people don't watch videos

389
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,480
or read books or entertain ideas from other political camps because they don't have to anymore

390
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,960
you know if you're a leftist you can go on youtube and watch an infinite amount of leftist content

391
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,840
and never be exposed to a right-wing idea and same same the other way around right there's

392
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,920
there's it's it sounds very strange but there's like there's too much access

393
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,880
and you know the the um the white pillar in me wants to say that well no people can be trusted

394
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,280
to diversify their their their media intake and understand what other people think and there are

395
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,960
some people who have for sure but it seems like most people just aren't doing it it's uh i think

396
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,240
that's oh i think that's go ahead no no i was just gonna say yeah like i know that you know

397
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,200
i've told you this in dms i am better at my job because i watch your videos and i do think because

398
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:42,080
you have such a salient uh brutal fair critique of the left i think it makes me stronger to watch

399
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,240
that critique and figure out what the answer is right so i agree with you that uh this tendency

400
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,720
for all of us to never listen to something on the other side it makes us weak it makes us unable to

401
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:02,000
function um and one of the reasons i really respect uh destiny a lot is i think more than

402
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,680
anyone else out there yeah look let's be clear he makes a lot of sweaty gamer comments he can

403
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,040
certainly tend towards being hyperbolic uh but i also think one of the good things he does is he

404
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,320
teaches people how to think i think when people make claims uh he really encourages his audience

405
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,000
to look through that to think through it uh before responding and to really really do your research

406
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,120
before having really strong opinions um i think that's a really good example um one of the things

407
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:40,720
i think has really really changed over my lifetime is this democratization of information i'm just

408
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,200
barely old enough to remember when you could get uh your news and it had to be on either cable or

409
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,320
the printed newspaper that came to your house every single day and that had a lot of downsides

410
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,480
you know you didn't hear about a lot of stories about gay people in uh that time period you know

411
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,240
the the the makeup of the newsrooms had huge implications for how things were covered which

412
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,360
is why i think we can look at public policy and the conversations we are not having about issues

413
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:15,440
like structural racism back in the 90s and see how simple they were compared to today that is a

414
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:22,720
bad thing but something was really good about that that i think is really really um under acknowledged

415
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,720
today is in the newspaper and cable news era of public information that did go through someone

416
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,600
at the top that was mature that was thoughtful that generally took some time to make sure the

417
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:46,720
stuff there was mostly accurate and did represent both sides um today we have no incentives for

418
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:53,760
any of that and i think we're much weaker as a society i think a direct reason we're seeing such

419
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:02,720
a stupid analysis on um on foreign policy issues today is we have now two generation of americans

420
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,160
they've never heard any position other than america is bad and our foreign policy is always

421
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,720
wrong and the world is a little bit more complicated than that even though we've made

422
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:20,560
plenty of foreign policy mistakes so i think that a really important thing is for america to take

423
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,600
more of a role in thinking about how this information landscape is influencing us right

424
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,880
we've got to protect free speech we've got to protect open expression but i also think we've

425
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,240
lost control the way people get their information to a mob and i don't think it's serving our

426
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:46,160
country well yeah so you're getting at like the post-truth era yeah if you know the post-modern

427
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:53,280
post-truth era yeah so it's it's like well can you trust cnn well i mean maybe you know they're

428
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,480
a decently big institution there's a lot of moving parts lots of people there but like

429
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,160
what if they're all compromised right well can you trust fox well maybe not like these are big

430
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,440
corporations and if you don't trust corporations because they're corporate you know maybe you want

431
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,520
to go somewhere else you know do you trust tim pool or do you trust like some some smaller site

432
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,840
do you trust some really fringe one like zero hedge or something because there's there's

433
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,920
utility and looking at the small guys too because they don't have corporate interests but they but

434
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,440
now they have like personal interests and they're and they're probably more radical than the

435
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,920
mainstream guys like anything can be tainted with some form of bias you know any company

436
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,080
any individual any institution so who do you trust and then you get to a point where it's

437
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,760
like well do you trust anything at all like i've i i've never been to antarctica so how do i know

438
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,400
that it actually exists right like it could be an entire like a huge psyop the entire world's

439
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,200
playing on me you can you can go down a rabbit hole joke about this but there are some people

440
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:53,040
there's a growing well it's not growing that fast but there is a portion of people who do just

441
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:00,880
don't trust anything any institution is suspect any fact is suspect look at the denialism that

442
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,840
has come out after october 7th of the things that everyone saw on video and suddenly there's

443
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,200
there's people with millions of followers with hundreds of thousands of likes on their shot shit

444
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,040
just making shit up and saying it and uh it gets more likes than the truth right and

445
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,160
yeah how do you how do you fix that because brianna woo like uh respectfully like there were

446
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,360
a lot of problems back when we had so much gatekeeping right like there's it held us back

447
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:38,560
so much and i don't know if we want or can go back to that style of having some kind of um

448
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,240
person on the top a uh uh some elite deciding what we can and can't like what i don't want

449
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,600
that right and that's not why i'm advocating i'm saying that i'm saying that every system has

450
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,680
upsides and downsides right a really big upside that system is there was an editor involved and

451
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,480
i think the fact that editor is no longer involved today is a real downside for how we are getting

452
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:13,920
information so you know like i think i think the fact that all of these algorithms exist to

453
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,200
addict you like they literally keep psychologists on staff to figure out how to addict you

454
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,800
i i don't have an immediate answer for this but i wonder if there's a role for us to take a more

455
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:34,080
active um in a regulatory position in asking how is so much social media affecting people's brains

456
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:40,720
right uh when the facebook whistleblower came out you know she was giving all kinds of instances

457
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,080
from facebook's own internal studies about what instagram is doing to an entire generation of

458
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,560
young women's brains and it's it's terrible it's upping their suicidality it's destroying their

459
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,960
body image it's leading to mental health issues i mean it's just across the board it's really really

460
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,840
bad and i just i'm not gonna tell you i have easy answers for this right now because all of these

461
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:10,320
problems are multi-factorial but i do think the fact that we've just basically seeded all of this

462
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,160
we've said we're not gonna take any role in this whatsoever i do think that's adding to the the

463
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,720
the instability that is really putting democracy at risk yeah you see there's like a there's another

464
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,720
i i mostly agree with you but there's a different way to kind of phrase it right

465
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,720
the downside of democratization is that people are generally retarded right and that's that's

466
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:39,360
just that's just how it is right you know man i okay i remember during the height of let's say

467
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,760
covid paranoia not to imply that covid wasn't real or anything i'm not going down that rabbit hole

468
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,600
okay i was about to say come on man i'm trying to keep my content monetized like

469
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,200
no no no but like there were people i remember some one person specifically said you need to

470
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,480
respect democracy and trust the experts and i'm like hold on those are two completely opposing

471
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,560
values because an expert opinion is specifically non-democratic it's the opinion of a learned

472
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,640
minority that is informing the unlearned majority right so when you have democratization you do

473
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,400
hear from more voices and that can be a good thing but also like special specialization is like is

474
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,040
like i don't know what the word is there there's something that is anti-democratic but also

475
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,920
necessary in society in order to actually try to ascertain what the truth is the the only issue is

476
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,760
like how can you trust that right it's we are in a quagmire like i have no solutions to this problem

477
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,960
i just know that at least on a local scale like within your own personal life if you do your best

478
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,320
to tell the truth you can make things at least somewhat better better for you and better for

479
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,720
people around you you know if you have a platform better for those who listen in on your platform if

480
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,240
you're allowed to be honest yes but i think one of the major problems with these platforms are

481
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,160
people are not allowed to be honest can we look can we talk about for a moment right i know this

482
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:10,880
is maybe off topic but this is bothering me ethan klein and hamas pipe oh i guess not uh give me a

483
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:23,280
second hopefully she ran away soon um i didn't kick her out gang wonder if she uh i hope her

484
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:31,280
internet's okay um we'll give it a second um in the meantime uh gang if you're enjoying this

bad ten dollars from zephyr hash to say at dev i get what you're saying but how long are we

491
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,320
supposed to wait and how much energy are we supposed to put into making sure everyone

492
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:11,440
understands our point of view specific specifically when time is of the essence

493
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,480
and also welcome back brianne hi uh my computer is restarting uh so i'm on my phone so sorry

496
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,080
come for you right like that this was your time and we were going to be like hearing news reports

497
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,200
or something of suddenly sunday uh found your location and his mob descended upon you i don't

498
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:47,200
know right uh yeah wick i've heard that you've you've had a beef with president sunday recently

499
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:54,800
what's that all about um he made some uh he keeps making shit up and going after people um he told

500
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:03,200
aristocracy that she needed to calm down after october 7th and made some very very um untoward

501
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,440
comments i called him out on that and here we are um there there are some people like i will

502
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,640
talk with pretty much anyone you know i'll talk with very far left people i'll talk with very

503
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,480
far right people um the people i won't talk with are the people who actually take it offline

504
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,400
right so i'll never speak uh okay i'll never speak to president sunday i'll never speak to

505
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,840
uh ethan ralph i'll never speak nick fuentes people who actually try to like get get your

506
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,080
get your stuff fucked up i will never talk to those people because that's that's too far for

507
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,800
me well i had a i had a gentleman um i this wasn't sunday to be clear it was someone else i know who

508
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,960
it was um recently um basically told me he's going to try to get my channel taken away uh he got me a

509
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:50,240
warning um uh on twitch the other day because i unfortunately forgot that uh one of my guests was

510
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:58,080
banned from twitch and uh but they they remembered and so i took a ding from that but yeah there are

511
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,040
people who will just sit on my shit wait for me to break toss and it is what it is yep same here

512
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:10,640
i mean this is really i think this is really a very serious problem where um one of the things

513
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:17,600
i have really found recently is i've i've really really enjoyed spending more time uh reaching out

514
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:23,280
and talking to people in the right wing right like i debated uh john doyle at the the university

515
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,120
of south carolina just a couple of days ago i did tim pool show uh you know dev i know i speak for

516
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,520
myself but i'm really enjoying speaking with you tonight you know uh despite you know our history

517
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,480
of gamergate and i i just i don't know we're talking about gamergate eventually the chat

518
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:46,480
we will get to that but before we do we'll finish we'll finish my point yeah go ahead what i was

519
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:54,160
going to say is i don't know when we got so afraid to actually talk about ideas right um it really

520
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:02,560
feels like the left our top answer for stuff nowadays is to um just refuse to engage with

521
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:10,320
anything that's unpleasant right and it's not i understand that often there's some ideas that

522
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,800
just are not worth responding to um like i think we would want to take the the like a policy

523
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,560
proposal of a holocaust in the united states uh seriously or give that air time but for a lot of

524
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:28,560
the stuff we talk about um i i think it's so counterproductive the way we won't engage it on

525
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:35,440
its merits just before the show uh i was watching ethan and hasan debate and ethan really having

526
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,920
some very salient points about why one state solution would not work for israel right and uh

527
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,240
just hasan would not engage with that in any honest way that's a that that that sticks on the

528
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,920
point that i wanted to bring up before you had your computer issues uh first of all your camera

529
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,520
isn't up so if uh i don't know oh apologize yeah i just didn't know you know um

530
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,840
let's talk about ethan and asan right because dev made the point that we need to be improve our uh

531
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:11,520
improve our areas of the internet by being honest ourselves so that and so my my question on this

532
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:18,000
my uh tack on this is i don't know if we are going to be allowed to do that right and i think the way

533
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,760
that ethan klein has been treated uh over his what is this the third fourth discussion he's

534
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:32,720
had with us on over all this right to see the vitriol my timeline has put on ethan for simply

535
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,760
being upset that a bunch of people like for having pretty normie takes right you can say they're

536
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:45,840
wrong or whatever but he's just being honest like you can't say that this guy's lying about this he's

537
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:52,480
being honest and to see the way that he is just being excoriated that he is losing respect

538
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,480
viewership etc to be being raked over the coals he was forced to apologize right to someone who

539
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,920
had offended him like uh it's it's it's wild to me and i don't see it getting better i think this is

540
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,960
kind of at least for the the foreseeable future the new norm you are not allowed to be honest

541
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,720
because if you are that platform or that space you have will be taken from you um what do you

542
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:26,000
think well kind of like like sargon's still around right he's certainly not on the left

543
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,720
he's something further to write than me he thinks i'm a communist for example which i'm not obviously

544
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,560
but he's he's he's but like we're still good friends though even though if you have political

545
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:40,400
differences we're still we're still pals um but he still has he's like he exists outside of the

546
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,360
leftist internet bubble and he still exists you know he he opened his uh his think tank and he

547
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,920
has like a dozen employees and he's doing his thing so there's definitely ways for you to

548
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,560
exist outside of like internet leftism i think i think you can still you can still you know speak

549
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:02,000
the truth if you're not in that bubble it's hard for people who are though because you know i've

550
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,840
seen a lot of people who are you know they're like center left you know like someone like stardust

551
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,080
right get into lots of trouble with some people for for speaking out against the far left

552
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:18,880
um hmm i i have a very black-pilled opinion on this oh no i hope maybe i can be white-pilled

553
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:28,880
on it one day but i think i think there's this view i think there's this view on the left

554
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,040
that because so much of of academia is leftist that the right just has no worthwhile ideas to

555
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,520
consider which isn't true there there's there's there's some decent right-wing literature out

556
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,680
there for sure that's worth reading i'm going to put a pin in that because i want to ask who

557
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:51,200
who what's the best right-wing opinion out there right now well so one of the things i you know i

558
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,520
was very very young uh i had to get over my you know religious right mississippi indoctrination

559
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,720
and i look back on that actually and see it as my superpower there are a lot of things uh that i

560
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,640
took from that that i think are very advantageous in my professional career um i think that the

561
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:16,480
right has some ideas about personal responsibility that are just just true they they are like um a

562
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,560
responsibility to solve your own problems i'll give you a really concrete example when it comes

563
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:26,560
to drug addiction one of the things like i just celebrated 20 years this is bryony right you have

564
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:33,920
noticed when you talk to left-wing friends their top um thing they suggest on this is not judging

565
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,240
let's get aa out of the mix because they are uh you know they're a non-secular organization all

566
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,800
of this and i can tell you the the thing that is most helpful for getting over a drug addiction

567
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:53,920
is accountability structure standards and frankly really harsh consequences when you fail

568
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:00,080
you know this is the reason drug courts are so effective right so i think that the right does

569
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,680
have some really common sense ideas that make less sense about how to get to where you want

570
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,880
to go in life sorry for the interruption dev i just i wanted to see what we would have to say

571
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:19,280
on that but carry on please right wing ideas the part okay you know where you're at um you you just

572
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:25,840
mentioned something about um getting away from aa right okay right and earlier you mentioned

573
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:31,280
refusing to engage with unpleasantness yeah something yeah okay so there's something i've

574
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,160
been i've been thinking about and and i had a conversation with sitch like six months ago that

575
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,880
kind of sparked this idea in me and i've really been going over um wick i know that you know about

576
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:47,840
height moral foundations yes um rihanna do you know about i don't i apologize okay it's a

577
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,560
psychology thing um jonathan hight did did research into the psychology of morality

578
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,280
and he basically pointed out that there's there's six dimensions across which humans

579
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,360
judge things to be moral or immoral and i just pull up i'll just pull up here real quick

580
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:11,360
okay that's uh care and harm fairness and cheating loyalty and betrayal authority and

581
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:18,560
subversion sanctity and degradation liberty and oppression and what he found with his research

582
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:26,880
is that you have certain political views map onto certain um certain moral foundations which

583
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:33,360
are more more or less important to the individual and also certain personality types so when you

584
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:38,000
have what what you found is that when you talk to someone who's very very progressive they tend to

585
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,280
basically only to care about care and harm right so maximizing care avoiding harm can you name the

586
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:51,680
other four really quickly so i can contrast that in my mind um it's care harm fairness cheating

587
00:58:52,480 --> 00:59:01,280
loyalty betrayal authority subversion sanctity degradation liberty oppression and those are the

588
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:08,960
six would uh i mean i mean we can see the liberty oppression right the oppressor what's the

589
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,320
difference between liberty impression and oppressor oppressed dynamic because the left is famous for

590
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,840
oppressor oppressed dynamics internal well in his research he found that socialists do tend to

591
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:27,040
value liberty and oppression progressives value it less than socialists um okay yeah but also like

592
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:33,040
like um uh fascists value authority overwhelmingly other than the other than the other five um you

593
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:39,200
find that conservatives tend to value loyalty more um religious people tend to value sanctity more

594
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,000
and progressives tend to value care and harm more liberals just like normally like central

595
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,880
centrist liberals tend to value fairness more right so you you have these different views of

596
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:55,840
morality that map onto different views of politics and i've seen so many very very progressive people

597
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,400
talk about like like harm reduction harm reduction is a great example harm reduction is like the

598
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,520
let's um let's not be so harsh on people who have drug addictions will give them like safe supplies

599
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,480
of heroin as if you ever have such a thing which is a good pro no needle programs do work we have

600
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:17,600
a lot of data about that yeah but like you also don't want to enable someone's addiction you don't

601
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:23,760
want it like like you you do want to have them to not be addicts first and foremost right sure but

602
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,840
i mean being out on the street like you know using dirty needles and getting all kinds of terrible

603
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:35,360
diseases it costs the public a ton of money it's not doing the many favors and it's an opportunity

604
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,360
to talk about getting them into treatment right that's true that's all true however you know if

605
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,840
if you have a different moral way of looking at it you might ask the question well i don't want to

606
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:53,520
be the person who gives a druggie some drugs that would not be obviously yeah yeah so so i agree

607
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,160
with you yes yeah so like there's there's different ways to view it right but you know with

608
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:03,520
with harm reduction does come the sense of if we just reduce as much harm as possible because

609
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,720
things are so like things are so terrible just just we have to reduce harm reduce harm you know

610
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,920
we can't worry about anything else just reduce the harm it's like well you're not building anything

611
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,080
virtuous there it's like yeah okay you're reducing harm but you're just like lessening the negative

612
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:22,880
you're not making anything positive if that makes sense so there's because you mentioned um aa and

613
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:30,080
aa has a religious component if you believe that religion is negative a net negative for society

614
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:37,600
then you might have the opinion of well i'm just gonna say fuck aa because it has these other

615
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:43,360
negative things that come along with it because i want i want the perfect answer and right isn't it

616
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,680
you know is this reflected just real quick and like the people who are critical of mr base who

617
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:53,120
built 100 wells or cured blindness and a thousand people and say well that's part of it because you

618
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:59,040
haven't fixed the structural issues you've just enabled the structural issues to keep uh to keep

619
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:04,880
going and your charity is actually uh causing long-term harm so yeah is that that's like that

620
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,920
that's part of it there's also another aspect of that though um that comes out of um angles

621
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,520
writing angles a socialist and marks and angles you know angle angles wrote about how basically

622
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:22,400
charity is evil because it is given at the discretion of the capitalist of the rich person

623
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,840
so he can make himself feel good by giving money to solve problems that he caused and it's like

624
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,960
well that's just ridiculous but it's like well i don't even agree with that point of view but

625
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,600
even if that were the truth it's still good to give the money right like the charity still has

626
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,240
its place but but it was his view that like well no the working class deserves the money so if you

627
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,320
if if a rich person gives it to them they're doing the bare minimum and you can't you can't give them

628
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,560
any sort of positive feedback for that and it's like well that seems almost sociopathic to me

629
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,480
can i circle around about something you were talking about because aa is a really good example

630
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,360
i think about this feeling of utopianism on the left and how this is so poorly i think it results

631
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:09,120
in really bad public policy so from my perspective my home state of mississippi has no resources

632
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:14,160
almost for drug addiction right i was very fortunate to have a family that could afford

633
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:21,120
to send me to thirty thousand dollar live at the rehab like therapy for you know two months

634
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:27,040
like and paid that out of pocket my god was i lucky about that but most people don't right

635
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:33,120
it's not going to surprise you mississippi does not have uh free for everyone drug and alcohol

636
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,960
uh uh treatment programs on the corner they do have a lot of churches that will lend space for

637
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:46,160
people so aa has a principle where you don't have to make god your higher power you can make aa

638
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,720
your higher power you can make spiritualism your higher power doesn't matter what you want to make

639
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:58,160
there are secular ways to do that and they are literally i see my own side talking about aa

640
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:04,880
as if this utopian let's make everything secular that itself is the goal the goal is not give

641
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:12,080
people that are addicted to drugs and alcohol a path to treatment and sobriety the goal is to be

642
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:18,800
morally pure and it's just so counterproductive i know more people that got sober from aa than i

643
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:25,120
do from rehab matthew perry in his book before he died have wonderful things to say about aa and i

644
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:32,000
just this is just this tendency of of having to have a perfect solution that i don't think is

645
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,080
resulting in good public policy yeah yeah and i think that that comes from heights moral

646
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:42,960
foundations right so i mean it's it's it's on wikipedia it's a pretty well-known idea if you

647
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,360
want to look at it in depth but basically like when you have two different people with two

648
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:52,320
different moral foundations you know one of them cares about care harm the other one cares about

649
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,360
you know loyalty betrayal so that would be like a progressive and a conservative

650
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,480
you put those two together they're going to view each other as immoral and not because one of them

651
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,040
is necessarily right and one is necessarily wrong but because they have different psychology right

652
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,480
so so the progressive might say hey you're hurting people with your behavior you should stop that

653
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,440
because we should be maximizing for care and the conservative might say you're betraying somebody

654
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,360
and we should stop that we should be maximizing for loyalty right so they're going to have

655
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,200
different they almost like it's almost like they speak a different moral language when they're

656
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,080
oh we do i i don't know if you've ever read this book what is the name of it it's talking about

657
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:33,360
the psychology of republicans and why um they kind of tend towards authoritarianism in ways

658
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:38,880
that the left doesn't but there is there's a like something i think that's really underappreciated

659
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,240
on the left is how the the foundation of how conservatives think really starts with this idea

660
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:51,520
of a a father figure in the home whose job it is to protect the family from harm in a lot of of

661
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,600
their of terrible ways right and that's making decisions listening providing like that's just

662
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:03,680
kind of the moral foundation of how a lot of conservatives think and i i see so many people

663
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,960
on my own side sneering at that but i think they're really out of touch with how a large part

664
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:14,240
of the country uh just views itself and what those relationships are like i don't know if

665
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:21,040
that's true um and let let's let's if if i may if you'll give me the title of the book if you'll

666
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:28,240
give me a minute yeah yeah it was a bestseller book but my my this idea that the right is

667
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:35,520
just tends towards more authoritarianism than the left i uh i don't know i don't it might be true

668
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,880
but i've seen a lot of authoritarian lefties in my day maybe it's a selection bias but i

669
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,920
hear this is an excellent book i highly recommend what's it called again republican brain by chris

670
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:54,000
mooney okay it is look i i think it's very clear like in recent events that the left is not pure

671
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,120
of this completely right but there is just more of a tendency it depends so there's like two

672
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:05,920
different types of authoritarianism right so there's like the autocratic authoritarian so the

673
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,080
the the strong man the person who who consolidates power into himself so that would be like the

674
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:15,440
fascist leader or the monarch you know the the singular strong entity but then on the left you

675
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,120
have like you have like democratic tyranny where it's it's mob rule and it's just simply by what

676
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,920
the majority wants which can also be very destructive so it's two different types of

677
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:34,240
authoritarianism i think yeah even then though right there are uh portions of the left um

678
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:41,520
though i guess some more authoritarian portions um that are democratic to an extent but then they

679
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,240
say something should never be voted on and it happens to be their most important uh values

680
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:51,280
as they think right like that yeah and so i don't i don't i don't know i don't know i'd have to look

681
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,920
into it more um i'm i well i i think i think that's just a practical necessity of obtaining

682
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,240
and wielding power you know that's just kind of how it has to be oh speaking of practical

683
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:08,320
necessities and uh retaining and wielding power and things like that um what do we think if i may

684
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,000
get your guys to i i see you chat i see you chat i know you want to talk about the gamer gate thing

685
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,960
i will ask a question about gamer gate thing i will i promise but let me let's let's let's save

686
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:23,600
it for the end to say about gamer gate is there anything new to say well we haven't sent it to

687
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,600
each other exactly exactly we will bury this hatchet but first right i am gonna spoil i i'm

688
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:35,520
not gonna get in a fight tonight i'm just not okay that's that's fine that's fine um but let

689
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:45,440
me ask this question instead uh for now um what do we think is the most likely outcome of this

690
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:51,440
upcoming election so tuesday we got a glimpse i think of where at least policy-wise the electorate's

691
01:08:51,440 --> 01:09:00,560
at right now uh republicans got thrashed um ohio um formalized abortion and it's a uh a codified

692
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:08,400
abortion i should say and it's a constitution uh the virginia or the kentucky i should say the

693
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,280
kentucky governor won reelection he's a democrat uh almost across the board democrats had a really

694
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:19,600
good night um we could juxtapose that with the doom and gloom we saw on social media about how

695
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:25,520
people never vote democrat never vote for biden never vote for anyone um that isn't calling for

696
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:32,240
a ceasefire etc etc etc um but do we think that this uh constant calls will have an effect going

697
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:39,440
forward on the 2024 election these constant calls to just boycott um biden boycott um the left or

698
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:45,840
anything or or is this all just hot air i gotta be honest i have not paid attention to american

699
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,320
politics in the past week or so so i don't know what you're useless to me okay fair enough sorry

700
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:58,160
whoo go ahead uh i i think it's very serious um you know uh i i think as part of my job i did look

701
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,920
a lot at the the outcome from tuesday obviously i'm happy when democrats win uh don't read too

702
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:10,480
much into it okay just don't uh biden's poll numbers are extremely weak right now we're seeing

703
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,920
the number of muslims that are currently planning to vote for him i'm not talking

704
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:19,600
to twitter conversations i'm talking about real polls uh it's not a good situation uh his numbers

705
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,800
with jewish people are down as well uh if the election were held today joe biden would lose

706
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:31,200
by a lot and joe mansion is not deciding not to run again because he's tired of having power

707
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,800
he's not running again because he's looking at biden uh he's seeing a path for him to win the

708
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:43,680
presidency this is extremely obvious and we need to take this really seriously the reason biden is

709
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:50,640
failing right now in the polls is the first best job of the president is to lead on messaging

710
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:58,080
and look i think he's been a really consequential president but he um he is older and it affects

711
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,680
his ability to give speeches and connect emotionally with the with the public and um

712
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:10,400
his current strategy of hiding is not working out uh his uh you know his campaign has 91 million

713
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,960
dollars on hand the last time i checked uh they need to be investing massively uh across the board

714
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:24,800
in messaging and helping set a new conversation in my view yeah i mean biden's kind of a zombie

715
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:30,080
at this point he's he's really old it's there's no way to remedy that when you're that old you're

716
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,240
just you're just kind of done to be honest at the same time like there have been some some things to

717
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:39,840
come out of his administration that i like i really like the chips act yeah yeah i have always i've

718
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,760
been i feel like i'm a hipster when it comes to china i was where i was worried about them before

719
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,080
it was cool to be worried about china but um like there's been some if you if you stay plugged into

720
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:55,200
like the right wing online ecosystem you you'd think that the world's completely falling apart

721
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,720
and it's not there's some problems but it's not nearly that bad um but i do think that biden just

722
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:07,120
i think based almost solely on his age and now maybe on the october 7th response like he might

723
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,000
not be the guy for for the democrats but at the same time um the republicans are in shambles as

724
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,880
well you know all of those republican primaries are basically just the the the debate of who is

725
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:26,880
going to eventually lose to trump and trump seems to be he he's not a very good president

726
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,760
and he's also extremely popular on the right yeah so gotta get more serious

727
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:39,040
yeah okay i mean it it's the man trump's like a wild card right now right because for 2024

728
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,960
imagine the possibility of trump wins the election and then also gets convicted on one of

729
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:52,960
those one of those charges what a shit show oh my holy shit but like if trump's gone you know if if

730
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,120
he if he actually is found guilty and he's locked away and he can't be president like who do the

731
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:04,800
republicans have i i think this is what rhonda santis is hoping for just a miracle at this point

732
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:10,960
so um yeah yeah i don't think they rally around this but anyway i don't want to get too much into

733
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,080
finish your thought uh dev and uh basically if we're just talking strategy de santis should

734
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,560
have waited he should have waited for trump's i like to for trump to finally be either vanquished

735
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,560
or get a second term and then come along next time this was not the time for i think i think

736
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:30,560
de santis basically destroyed his political career jumping in maybe um i know that uh

737
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:36,480
it would be an open question at this point right who would take that uh standard from

738
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:42,000
trump trump goes away unfortunately i don't think trump's going away i think that uh whoever

739
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:50,560
that biden will be facing trump in the 2024 runoff um and we'll see uh i i see the polling today

740
01:13:50,560 --> 01:14:00,240
the polling isn't uh it isn't comforting not to say the least but years a long time years a long

741
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:05,200
time i guess to to kind of maybe bring it into something that you have been following

742
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:12,800
um we've seen israel's messaging um of light how do you think they're doing dev do you see the

743
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:18,400
snl style skit they did the other day no i didn't see that either you didn't dev what are you are

744
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,800
you not paying attention to anything i've been away for a little bit i've been away for a little

745
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:31,280
bit sorry oh you're killing me bro you kill me okay um i i do know that like man when it comes

746
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:38,240
to the the israel-palestine conflict as a whole i'm like soft pro-israel but soft pro-israel you

747
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:44,720
know but man it's that's that's just that's just a shit show you have basically two sides that

748
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,480
i think beneath the mask they both want to genocide each other and one side is capable

749
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:55,360
of doing it the other side if the power balance were reversed they would be doing it so it's like

750
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,840
well like what the fuck you're gonna do at that point i don't think there's much that that the

751
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:07,440
west can do frankly i think it's like a hopeless situation fair enough i think we are seeing i was

752
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:13,280
talking to a really good uh jewish friend of mine about this about why there's such a generational

753
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:20,000
divide on on israel right now and i think it really comes down to the fact you know my friend

754
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,960
i believe he's in his uh 60s you know i'm in my 40s and yet we're both old enough to remember when

755
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:33,280
israel was really making a public messaging push and trying to help the public understand

756
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,880
why like the need for israel to exist was important you know things like that right now

757
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:45,360
we're really seeing one side uh make that case particularly to the left and uh you know i think

758
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:51,760
that when israel comes out and uh their response to a whole bunch of civilians getting killed in a

759
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:59,040
a strike that hits a hospital uh to basically kill one person it's like civilians die in war

760
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:05,040
which is nearly a direct paraphrase of what they said um you know it's it's really bad

761
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:13,280
messaging right um so i think uh anyone serious about uh national security will tell you that

762
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:18,160
um you're weighing the hearts and minds of people helping them understand and empathize with you is

763
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:23,520
a really critical part of that i think under netanyahu uh they're basically running the exact

764
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:30,160
same playbook that bush did which is harder right harder fringe messaging doing it in really moral

765
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,680
terms and not really making that effort to make the same number of friends so uh no wick i think

766
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:42,400
uh israel has been really really bad at messaging lately and i think if they don't change course i

767
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,920
think it's going to be there's going to be less and less willpower in washington to support them

768
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:55,920
and certainly all this uh you know horrific inexcusable level of civilian death is not

769
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:04,320
aiding that either so um i think they're i think it's really dire it has been a kind of like a mind

770
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:11,520
fuck almost yeah to watch the horrific images coming out of gaza um coming out of the airstrikes

771
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:20,800
and things like and then to have israel um put out an snl skit about it right um and you're like

772
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:29,520
someone is making these decisions consciously like is someone that they need to replace whoever

773
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:35,120
is in charge of that i understand why they're doing it i understand why they think they need

774
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,800
to use memes and comedy to appeal to the youth because as polling recently has shown

775
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:49,440
to put it mildly israel has a youth problem here in the west um they have been bleeding

776
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:58,080
support um from like again it's it's just a thing we grew up knowing that america supports israel

777
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,200
but i don't know if that's going to be the same in 20 years from now right

778
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:10,240
as the new cohort takes power and seeing not only the online response but also the polling also uh

779
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:17,600
the massive amounts of youth young people going into the streets not just saying free palestine

780
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:25,840
but gas the jews kill the jews israel needs to be destroyed intifada intifada from britain to gaza

781
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:34,480
right um there is a problem here um and i think israel knows it has to try to

782
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:41,840
reverse that trend i just don't think it knows how um what do you think that was just a public

783
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:48,720
messaging problem i think that you know look netanyahu and lakud party i mean they've taken

784
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:53,200
israel in a very very right wing direction and i think anyone that's being paid anyone that's

785
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:59,120
been paying attention to this including i would say the majority of jews in this country have

786
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:04,560
been increasingly um disturbed by the foreign policy direction of israel for quite a while

787
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,520
right so i certainly see that i don't think it's just a messaging problem i think it's

788
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:15,200
actually kind of analogous to america's reputation in the world following the iraq war right you know

789
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,720
no no any thoughts on this dad before we move on

790
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:27,280
if i were to like put myself in the headspace of somebody who let's say is very pro israel

791
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:34,800
who's who's in israel and is very pro israel i it feels like what they're probably thinking

792
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:42,320
is something like they saw what happened on october 7th and they saw all the memes come out

793
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:48,320
about paragliders and they're like oh okay so i guess we're just cool with killing civilians

794
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,160
and memeing about it now and so they're saying well then let's do that for our side

795
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,200
fair enough i don't think i think they real they they don't realize though that's not how

796
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:05,440
how the game works here we don't yeah it's not it's not tit for tat it's um we do it to egg you

797
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:10,160
on so that when you do it we can call you out for it and ignore that we did it too and then just

798
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:14,560
paint you as the worst actor ever uh fair enough uh let me read a super chat i got for you and then

799
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:22,000
we'll move on to the next question 10 bucks from lives and dev's walls i'm assuming it's someone

800
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:29,040
from your community sir yes how do we restore faith in or the integrity of necessary institutions

801
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,800
amid clear failures stopping the spread of ludicrous conspiracies requires viable claims

802
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:41,600
to be handled properly the way epstein wasn't and i would and this is my words now right to

803
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,800
maybe move away from the epstein thing one of the reasons that people think especially you think

804
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:54,160
america bad is because of the horrendous way that america handled foreign policy with the afghan

805
01:20:54,160 --> 01:21:02,720
and iraq war especially the iraq war right um and the just uh abysmal failures um from the

806
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:09,760
foreign policy community um and how we have handled all these things so to his question

807
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,160
how do we restore faith in the integrity of it because just because america is wrong sometimes

808
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:18,240
doesn't mean america is wrong all the time but that seems to be the lesson that a lot of people

809
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:24,960
took from the last 20 years is that america is just that right so i i can speak to this from

810
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,520
the the point of view of like more right-wing people that i know right because they all believe

811
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:36,800
that 2020 was a stolen election i did on the night of 2020 and i don't now and i went through

812
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:42,960
a process of figuring out why it wasn't so i'm sure you've both seen that that that video that's

813
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,360
been shared around millions of times where the polling station closes up and then one of the

814
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,760
workers you know pulls back the tablecloth and brings out a case of new ballots right

815
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,320
then wheels it over and starts counting the narrative on the night of the election was

816
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,880
that that was a case full of fraudulent ballots right and it needed to be investigated and it

817
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,040
needed to be it needed to be answered for like why is this woman pulling these ballots out

818
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,640
um and that's what everyone was saying including me on the night of the election

819
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:14,640
um it turned out that as the as the court cases and went through and the audits went through and

820
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,880
all all these sorts of things to see if the election was actually real or not it turns out

821
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,720
that um if you actually go back and like read some of the buried articles about that specific case

822
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:29,520
the judge said okay i sat down and i watched all the security camera footage and that was

823
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,240
actually a case full of legitimate ballots that was brought in earlier and the reason that it was

824
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:40,480
brought in is because republicans in that state had changed the laws such that mail-in ballots

825
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:45,600
could not be counted until after all the other ballots were counted so they were just being

826
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,320
stored under the table until it was time to count them so it was actually one of those things where

827
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,480
republicans changed the law and then it created a video that they got that they then had a

828
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:59,600
conspiracy theory about right but all of my right-leaning friends didn't keep up with any

829
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,400
of these investigations or any of these trials or any of these audits they they had you know

830
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:10,640
that the 15 that the 15 minutes news cycle on twitter and then moved on to the next thing right

831
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:16,240
and so after a month or two of investigations no one's talking about it anymore so

832
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,400
pretty much like i i kept i kept my finger on the pulse of all these stories because i wanted

833
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:25,280
to know but like nobody else that i know on the right did and now here we are three years on and

834
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:30,160
people are still bringing up that exact same video clip as if it's as if it's it's proof of something

835
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:36,720
and it's not so i i think it's it's social media it's a shortened attention span and it's people

836
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:42,880
being in echo chambers and and that is causing people to spin up completely different theories

837
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,880
about about how things are actually functioning and because they never actually return back to

838
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,600
rethink those ideas through they just kind of sit in their brains for for a few years that becomes

839
01:23:53,600 --> 01:24:02,480
what actually happened we see it playing out live like we see this video i saw of a helicopter an

840
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:09,840
apache helicopter blowing away hamas terrace it was originally shared saying that it was israel

841
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:17,120
just indiscriminately firing into the crowd at the uh the rave killing both innocent civilians

842
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:23,360
and hamas terrace and see look the idf calls most of these deaths um it was obviously shown to be

843
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
no they were attacking an entirely different place these were just hamas terrace that were trying to

844
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,400
run back into gaza after they had done their thing uh but it was too late it had gotten millions of

845
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:39,920
views hundreds and thousands of likes and no one's going to go back to that right no one's

846
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,960
going to to check it again it's now it's now it's now a fact and they are going to run with it right

847
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,520
yeah after it goes viral people aren't going to come back you know a week later or a month later

848
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,480
after the investigation is done they're just going to remember it as it was i think that's why like

849
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:01,920
you know look i i hear what you're saying about this being a problem it's certainly correct my

850
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:07,840
mind always always always goes what is the public policy solution how can we how can we start to do

851
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,480
this i think like something i'm trying to do as a public figure and someone that works in this

852
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:17,200
field and trying to talk more with people on the other side and trying to have civil conversations

853
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:23,280
i think it's really important for those of us to model this i think that but i think the real

854
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:29,600
problem that's really difficult to solve is it really comes down to the algorithm right we have

855
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:35,600
a fundamentally different information space now that rewards sensationalism it rewards conflict

856
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:43,120
it rewards hyperbole and it it's how do you square that with the fact i think all of us here

857
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,720
agree with free speech we agree with open expression we don't want anyone censoring those

858
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:55,280
hot takes but we've got to come up with the way that the american people are being better served

859
01:25:55,280 --> 01:26:00,160
by the information that we're getting and let's be really clear this is not just an american

860
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:06,240
problem democracy is weakening all around the world and yet this being the way we consume

861
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:14,160
information is part of why it's it's destabilizing our country so i think this is i think it's really

862
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:20,560
really important and i i don't think that say facebook should have the amount of power it does

863
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:27,040
over the news uh that they do um maybe the answer is break them up i i truly don't know

864
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:34,080
but i i think something's got to change i don't know about uh policy uh like policies that can

865
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:39,600
be adopted to uh to improve this i'm not sure about that i do know that i have very little

866
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:46,000
influence over policy but i can control what i do right and so i can at least do better personally

867
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,960
and that's at least a little bit like you know if you are part of the world and you are if you

868
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,240
do better you've made the world slightly better so if all i can do is look at it from an individualist

869
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:02,880
perspective then that's what i do fair enough fair enough okay i'm going to ask the question

870
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:11,040
that my audience i know i know i know but it's it's it's here it's the elephant in the room and again

871
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:17,440
um well we gotta talk about it gamergate i've thought about the best way to do this

872
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:23,040
conversation for a little bit well then why not take it take it away dev man go ahead okay um

873
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,520
you don't have to get too in detail i guess but what was gamergate about from your

874
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,360
side from your perspective because you were anti-gamergate i was pro-gamergate so

875
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:37,600
since you're on opposite sides of the conversation i mean having seen me talk about this a million

876
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:47,200
times in media i mean so gamergate was about a organized harassment campaign against women in

877
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,840
the game industry i know y'all don't want to believe it was a real thing it was it hurt a lot

878
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:58,720
of people's lives and her reputations many of my friends quit the game industry uh permanently and

879
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,880
it was uh in my view the start of this playbook that when someone's saying or doing something you

880
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:10,640
don't like uh investigate them go through everything they've ever said find something

881
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:16,640
to smear them with and uh just try to destroy them by the with the mob um well speaking of

882
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,640
destroying with the mob sunday thanks for watching i see you making tweets about me

883
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,520
yeah you know i hope you like the channel as well but continue

884
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:32,560
so that's basically it what about you dev from your perspective so

885
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:38,880
um the pro-gamergate side is that it wasn't about harassment and it was actually about

886
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,720
there was ethical problems in in the gaming industry at the time

887
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:50,480
and i was definitely on board for the ethical problems i breanna i think you saw my my video

888
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:56,000
about phil fish and the investigation that i did like 10 years ago into the actual ethical

889
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:02,240
problems that that he was a part of because he did do some underhanded stuff um stardust at one

890
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,160
point when she when she was going to talk to you actually like was it six months ago or a year ago

891
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:11,120
or something yeah she she asked me about gamergate because she knew that i was involved in it and i

892
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,920
gave her my playlist of gamergate videos and she went she went through a few of them just to get

893
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:21,120
get a feeling of what it was like on the pro-gamergate side back then and i watched

894
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:26,880
a bit of her reacting to my old videos i hadn't seen my videos in 10 years and in the second video

895
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,840
i specifically say at the very start okay before we get in today's into today's content

896
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,160
i see that some of you guys are are actually harassing people and you guys need not to do

897
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:42,000
that you need to stop that shit so i was definitely even back then very cognizant about

898
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,320
the fact that there were some people who were taking it too far and also there were some people

899
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:51,920
who were simply hitching themselves to the situation to try and boost their own career

900
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:58,720
right people don't know this nowadays but milo came out of gamergate right yep um uh mike

901
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:04,000
cernovich came out of gamergate milo yanopoulos to be clear yes okay fair enough yeah yeah they

902
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,520
both yeah i don't have any issue with that yeah i've been friends with hat for my god 10 years

903
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:14,800
now right like he's one of those people trained as a journalist genuinely interested in the

904
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:23,040
the ethical concerns of that i just i think if all of us on this show tonight agree that uh the

905
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,760
outcome of progressive policies right now isn't always talking about health care it's about a

906
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,600
bunch of unrelated like cultural things that we do that are are not ethical i think we can

907
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:40,640
be honest and that like gamergate did a lot of that as well what's your biggest regret dev

908
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:45,360
what's your biggest regret from the gamer gate years my biggest regret from the gamer gate years

909
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,760
is that when phil fish sent me a cease and desist i listened to it and i took my video down

910
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,840
because i shouldn't have i shouldn't have given in to that kind of uh intimidation

911
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,640
can you just remind me like i like i i haven't spoken to phil in like

912
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,240
10 years but can you remind me what your ethical issue was with him

913
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:13,680
basically he he uh his game fez was the only game to win an award at the igf for two separate years

914
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:19,360
sure and one of them was for the demo of fez and one of them was for the actual release of fez

915
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,360
and the igf kind of hand waved up by saying oh it's a demo so it's not the same game

916
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:27,760
but it's the only game they give that treatment to that treatment too and then when phil fish's

917
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:34,320
company got hacked it came out that there were a bunch of people who were judges at the igf who

918
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:39,760
had invested in his company and they served and they they they were in a position to to

919
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:45,840
personally profit from the fact that the ig that that fez won so many awards and and was the only

920
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,280
game to win awards in two separate years it was like 2007 2012 or something like that yeah that's

921
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:59,280
pretty bad uh in to play i'm not defending that fez is a really good game though yeah yeah yeah

922
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:04,720
but i hear i hear you that's not defensible obviously they should uh ever use themselves

923
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,800
i just think you know directionally if you look at the state of the game industry today

924
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:15,120
i mean uh let's just be blunt uh ign is weaker than it's ever been kotaku hasn't been a force in

925
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:21,120
in the game industry in a while and you know when it comes to game coverage i think you know

926
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:26,960
skill up do a really good job uh but i think there's a whole host of youtubers that do

927
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:32,960
a much much worse job and they are directly being paid by these companies to come cover their

928
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:39,520
product right so i think if you look at i i just haven't seen that same level of anger at the

929
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,800
current state of the game industry which i think is way more rife with problems than it was a decade

930
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:50,800
ago i mean i'm i'm still like i'm still a pretty small channel in terms of the big leagues right

931
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:55,360
i know that like 150 000 subs is like kind of big but it's also kind of small to be honest

932
01:32:55,360 --> 01:33:01,280
i don't have millions i don't have that much much reach um no i still talk 150 000 okay you know

933
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:08,720
what i mean like like there's guys out there with millions of subs yeah yeah so much i'm i'm okay

934
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:14,480
what i mean to say is like i can only do so much but i do talk about like shitty youtubers as well

935
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:20,400
sure on my channel yeah i i do my part channel mostly you shut a lot of progressives on tik tok

936
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:24,880
you have a like most of your videos are tik tok tuesday nowadays which is a shame because i like

937
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:31,200
your last foreign content so much more that is it's only because i'm lazy and and your situation

938
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:35,040
with them causing so much noise at your house so fair yeah there's been there's been some

939
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:40,720
construction and also i've been quite lazy do you think um i guess i'll ask this right

940
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:51,680
for the many years you've been covering culture around games games etc um dev what is what is

941
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:58,720
have we improved overall or as rihanna wu has asserted have we have we just gotten worse i know

942
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:04,400
for me right when i was growing up and i wanted to know if a game was good there was some magazines

943
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,640
i would read or pick up or Nintendo power yeah things like that i would look through them and

944
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:13,920
i would get the strategy there no ethical issues yeah i would get the strategy guides and things

945
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:18,960
like that and i would pour through them i would go to blockbuster and look at the cool games that

946
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:24,240
were up for rent and i'd do that nowadays if i want to get a game right uh or if i want to see

947
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:31,600
if a game is worth getting uh i will go and look at either a youtube playthrough through it and see

948
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:39,120
some reviews or a let's play i will go to the steam user reviews and kind of click through a

949
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:45,520
few of them positive negative um so that as a normie someone who isn't like a super gamer

950
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:50,320
that's how i usually engage with the gaming industry today versus back then so i guess from

951
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:54,480
someone who covers that kind of thing and someone who i would consider much more of a gamer and a

952
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:59,280
nerd than i am um dev what better worse what do you think

953
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:10,320
hmm i don't think it's better or worse i think it's very different things have definitely

954
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:16,240
changed but i think we're probably about the same level as we were well then let's go to individual

955
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:21,680
let's go away from the the overall then so what into an individual instance is what do we do

956
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:29,040
better and what do we do worse okay um well gaming press like you said breanna gaming press

957
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:35,520
is definitely weakened right like all these sites are shutting down and and the the institution the

958
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,320
the career of journalists doesn't have the prestige that it used to have so that's probably worse

959
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:45,040
right and now you can argue whether or not that's because they were bad at their jobs or whether it

960
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,880
was because we don't respect them anymore it's probably a mix of both because there's been some

961
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:54,640
really bad journalism as well um the issue with youtubers and this goes beyond what you're what

962
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:59,680
you're mentioning wick but it does also involve this um is that youtubers don't take themselves

963
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:03,760
seriously enough i think and streamers don't take themselves seriously enough this is not related

964
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:10,240
to gaming but have you met streamers like i what we take ourselves way too seriously but go on

965
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:15,840
i meant in terms of like professional ethics oh fair enough that's true but we take ourselves

966
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:21,440
super seriously go on drama yes but like okay okay this is not related to gaming but it

967
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:26,480
definitely you can use this logic on a whole bunch of gaming youtubers right do you remember recently

968
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:32,560
um hasan i think he went on it was on national tv or it was somewhere and he said i'm just a

969
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,360
streamer man i have no control over anything i can't i can't control what my audience does

970
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,040
i can't i can't set any sort of narrative and it's like hold on if you're the biggest leftist

971
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:46,480
streamer in the world you should have some ability to set the narrative are we talking

972
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:52,800
about hamas piker okay gary yes that's what we're talking about but like that's not gaming but the

973
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:57,680
point still stands is that like if you have a platform and it's a reasonably big platform like

974
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:02,640
we're talking like millions of subs or you know tens of thousands of viewers on twitch or something

975
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:09,680
you do have the ability to to set to set um to set conversations basically yeah and i and i think

976
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:18,000
that streamers they when it comes time for them to let's say be ethical in how they behave they

977
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,760
say i'm just a guy in my living room in my bedroom i don't know what's going on i can't affect

978
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:28,000
anything but when it comes time for them to take massive bags of cash from ubisoft or whoever they

979
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,320
take the massive bag of cash you know what i mean i do know what you mean um let me ask you directly

980
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:38,560
then um okay how do you fill your audience in this how do you abdicate your responsibility

981
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,480
have you or are you above the fray

982
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:48,400
well i don't take massive bags of cash there's that's one thing like i i've made i've made a

983
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,760
deal with myself that if i'm ever going to do out like a product sponsorship for example

984
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:56,880
it has to be something that i actually like and use myself i won't i won't like i know i don't

985
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:02,080
use vpns um until i start using one i'm not going to take a deal for a vpn for my channel right

986
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,000
it's one of those it's one of those types of things that's kind of how i view it is like

987
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:13,280
i i want even if you disagree with me i want people to trust in the fact that i'm saying what

988
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:19,600
i actually think even if you don't like it yeah yeah i feel the same way i take a i take a lot of

989
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:25,760
pride in the you know my professional integrity i mean i really try very hard to tell the truth

990
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:31,120
i try to answer questions even when they're unpleasant when they're asked of me and i try

991
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:37,920
to engage issues honestly and yeah sometimes that comes from critiquing my own side um you know and

992
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:43,360
it's it's hard i mean i feel like all the incentives now this is something i see over

993
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:48,240
and over again in the streaming space like wick my assessment is there are a lot of really

994
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:54,320
fundamentally dishonest people in this space it's really hard trying to figure out who to talk to

995
01:38:54,320 --> 01:39:01,360
who to interact with who not to what have you uh like so i know we've talked off screen right

996
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:06,400
about different people and things like that but i i just want to get a well i have two questions

997
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:12,160
for you one to go back to the same question i asked dev and speaking of asking hard questions

998
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:19,760
um i know you talked about um how one of your regrets is keeping it online and not taking it

999
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,400
offline and do things but other than that regarding your behavior towards others right

1000
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,680
yeah do you have any regrets oh my god can you absolutely maybe talk about that a little bit

1001
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:36,480
and then i i did i my second question to keep in mind would be um that since we live in as dev set

1002
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:41,120
a space where there are people with a lot of influence who's abdicated for it how do you how

1003
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:47,120
do you sift the wheaten from the chaff who do you decide how to why did you pick me to to work with

1004
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:53,760
instead of sunday for example like like how do you how do you filter i guess go on well you're

1005
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,320
not a congenital liar well true but no you know what i mean i'm being hyperbolic but you know what

1006
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:03,200
i'm saying how do you sift the wheat from the chat so i feel like i've answered the same question a

1007
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:09,600
million times i'll do it again um you know i know gamergate wants to pretend like what they did

1008
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:15,280
didn't traumatize me but it did i had a clinical ace of trauma alive women in the game industry

1009
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:21,840
also had clinical aces of trauma um it fucking broke me uh the stuff that went on um

1010
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:32,720
so i can look back at my behavior and see how reactive and angry i was and i was not

1011
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:39,920
always responding to things in a way that was productive right so i think if i did it over

1012
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:45,680
again you know i would have unplugged from twitter a lot sooner um i think i would have

1013
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:52,080
held on a lot of media appearances until i could react without so much anger in the moment um

1014
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:59,680
so i just you know i feel like i squandered this opportunity to really advocate for better policy

1015
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:05,760
for women in the the game industry and just on a personal note you know i cause so much pain

1016
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:13,360
like one of the things is when you're traumatized you you you hurt the people around you um you know

1017
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:21,600
i hurt my friends um i hurt uh you know i love frank dearly but i think he saw me at uh the

1018
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:30,000
worst in some ways during gamergate right um so just just in the the midst of trauma i acted with

1019
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:38,160
a lot of pain into things i'm not proud of right i do want to point out real quick sure um my

1020
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,440
my involvement with gamergate was only on the ethics side of it and i certainly wasn't

1021
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,200
responsible for any of that i'm sorry that it happened to you though i appreciate that thank

1022
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:54,080
you can we can consider the hatchet berry of enemies uh of all they become i consider you a

1023
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:59,840
friend i mean i well maybe not a friend i think we have a respect for each other we have a respect

1024
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:05,360
for each other right like i like you i like your content i don't agree i preferred friend but okay

1025
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:09,760
let's see if you want to be my friend i'll be your friend what's up dev what's what's your favorite

1026
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,920
part what's your favorite thing about brianna woo today what's your favorite what's brianna

1027
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,520
woo's best quality what do you like about her most friend of brianna

1028
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:30,640
irrespective of of how victimized you were 10 years ago you definitely had some crazy takes

1029
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:37,280
yeah back then and you do not seem like that crazy person now and that's actually that's

1030
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:44,960
actually quite heartening because so many people just get worse over time well i i'm sure that

1031
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:49,680
that probably sounded like a backhanded combat i didn't mean it to you but i i get it i think

1032
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:55,520
that running for office did teach me a hell of a lot about how to advocate for things that i

1033
01:42:55,520 --> 01:43:02,880
believed in right um so i think that was part of it was a real growing up experience so um thanks

1034
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:06,560
i guess i i would hope that you would see me as somebody with integrity

1035
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:13,040
you know do you make friends a lot dad do you have a lot of friends like uh just curious

1036
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:24,240
kind of okay i have you you recognize that it was just a like sort of a shit answer but go on

1037
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:33,280
no it's it's there's a lot of people that that i think can't stand me and sometimes i wonder why

1038
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:37,840
and it's like well like is it my personality that's a problem is it like but then i realize

1039
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:44,480
usually it's because like i'm i'm pretty honest and that can drive a lot of people away and it

1040
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:49,920
doesn't mean that i'm like a perfect truth teller i just i i do i i don't i talk the same way online

1041
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,800
is off i talk the same way public as in private you know i found that just like keeping secrets

1042
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:59,280
and kind of like being a backroom schemer it it makes you a worse person in the long run

1043
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:04,320
so i don't do that and that rubs some people the wrong way but five dollars from cryborn to say i

1044
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,040
like brianna's pragmatism and recent work with bringing together left-wing streamers thank you

1045
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:13,360
for the five dollars and thank you for a good example of a good answer to that question um

1046
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,200
i guess uh

1047
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:20,880
well same thing uh i think you already said about his videos but

1048
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:28,000
you consider him a friend what about him that you like right personally i i think you have

1049
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:34,000
really insightful criticisms of the right and the left um i don't i don't think you're as much of a

1050
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:40,080
centrist from my point of views i think you you you tell yourself that you are but i think you

1051
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:47,120
are i'm sorry am i a right winger from your point of view i don't know if right winger i think you

1052
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:55,680
have a kind of instinctual distrust of anything um i think that when someone comes to you and

1053
01:44:55,680 --> 01:45:01,200
tells you they don't feel like they're getting a fair shake in society i think you have a kind of

1054
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:09,120
instinctual uh tendency to dismiss that um that and i don't think you're coming to that like

1055
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:15,200
inauthentically or i don't think it's egregious right uh i i just i don't think it's the right

1056
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:21,200
answer right uh but what i appreciate about you is i think in the the course of your i think you

1057
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:26,560
produce some extremely thoughtful videos i think you're actually a really friendly person and

1058
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:31,360
honestly i really this is silly thing but the way you talk about your um is it your girlfriend or

1059
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:37,440
your wife naomi uh it's really apparent how much you care for her and uh i i think that uh i don't

1060
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:42,960
know it just makes my heart grow three sizes every time i hear that i'm actually told that

1061
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:48,560
a lot that like i relate whenever our relationship bleeds into online people really like it yeah

1062
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:55,840
yes how did y'all meet if i can ask um we both worked the same awful part-time job back when i

1063
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:01,680
was in school yeah and we just kind of stayed together even after i left you know no five

1064
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,840
dollars from artemis fowl dev is my favorite white nationalist communist

1065
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:15,120
thank you oh my god so yeah like there was that there was that one short of demon mama

1066
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,840
demon almost called me a fascist so many times at this point but there was that one where like

1067
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:28,080
it was demon mama was lambasting you for talking to me brianna meanwhile i can go to some very far

1068
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:34,960
right youtube channels where i'm being discussed and i'm like this leftist subversive communist

1069
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:40,400
cuck who's trying to get into right-wing spaces to like convert people so one of the big reasons

1070
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:46,320
why i do think that i'm a centrist is because so many people say the same things about me on two

1071
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:50,320
extreme sides but they're inverted and it's like okay there's something here i think there's something

1072
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:57,200
i deal with that too dev that doesn't make me a centrist i'm not you know like the exact same

1073
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:01,040
thing happens to have the left screaming at me i've certainly had the right screaming at me

1074
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:09,200
i mean how is it's it's the same thing right maybe the difference um i have a i have a saying

1075
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:13,360
i've been this is i think this is gonna become my like my dev saying this would be my branding

1076
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:18,240
it's this idea that um governments should be liberal and people should be conservative

1077
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:23,600
that's kind of how i i lay out my approach to politics because can you elaborate on that

1078
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:33,840
sure sure so um when it comes to government policy like big big ticket things what what federal level

1079
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:40,160
governments should do in america or in canada or in other other similarly sized states i tend

1080
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,280
to agree more with liberals than with conservatives not consistently you know i'm definitely more pro

1081
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:50,000
gun than the average canadian for sure but i mean my stance on health care i think americans would

1082
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,120
consider americans who aren't terminally online would consider to be far left right something

1083
01:47:55,120 --> 01:48:02,480
like that however when it comes to how i think you should organize your life on a personal level on

1084
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:06,480
like a local level i'm much more conservative because i think those things are generally just

1085
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:12,560
better for people right you know like having having you know uh a good family life for example

1086
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,560
that's that's more of a that's more of a conservative thing than let's say a progressive

1087
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:22,240
thing but it's very important for people right having like more traditional family roles people

1088
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:28,080
tend to be happier on average when they engage with those with with those types of of lifestyles

1089
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,960
it doesn't mean you should be forced into it there's lots of conservatives that think you

1090
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,640
should be forced into it i don't think that at all right if you're if you're you know cut from

1091
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:39,760
a different cloth then go ahead and do your thing right here's a good example okay so i think i was

1092
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:46,320
talking to dylan burns a few months back um and i want like i was outlying to him you know the

1093
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,480
conservative case for gay marriage right and basically the the argument that i was playing

1094
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:57,120
to him is let's say that you're a young gay man and you have two life paths ahead of you right

1095
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:04,080
and down one life path is you could get into like a monogamous relationship and adopt some kids and

1096
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:09,520
raise them right get a decent job and contribute to your community be a be a productive person

1097
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:13,280
you know and but these are all very conservative things even though it's a gay person doing them

1098
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:19,520
or you could you know go go to the gay bar and be very promiscuous maybe catch a few diseases

1099
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:24,400
you know debase yourself debase other people make people not proud of you you know what what would

1100
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:29,520
be you're allowed to to to engage in hedonism because that's what a free society is but

1101
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,920
what should you do you know what would be better for you what we what would be better for

1102
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:40,400
the people around you if we what what character should you have as a person right and it seems

1103
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:46,560
like more often than not organizing your life in a conservative way not necessary not necessarily

1104
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:52,240
a religious way but a conservative way does seem to make people happier and healthier so

1105
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:55,360
on the local level i'm pretty conservative on the national level i'm pretty liberal

1106
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,920
you know i've been married for 15 years i'm a pretty you know i've got a house i've got a

1107
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:09,520
job you know like i i certainly agree with that i think where i i would really ask you and i don't

1108
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:14,480
mean this disrespectfully but my my critique of you would be the exact same as tim pool in

1109
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:22,320
the sense that there's such a a disproportionate amount of of um criticism that i think happens

1110
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:28,560
on your channel right um and and i agree with that like i certainly have had plenty of criticism for

1111
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:34,720
the fringe left lately but it's also true my day job is 100 about beating the republicans at the

1112
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:41,600
ballot box right that's what i'm paid you know to do so i mean how can you see yourself in the

1113
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:49,360
middle when so much of your content is about going after the left the main reason i do that

1114
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:57,600
is because it's very criticism of the rights very simple right we all kind of intuitively get it's

1115
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:03,520
like you know should you oppress gay people no obviously right like should you be racist

1116
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,400
no it doesn't it doesn't take much brain power to explain why you shouldn't be a racist or why

1117
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:13,040
you shouldn't be a homophobe you can easily lay these arguments out criticism of the leftist

1118
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:18,960
complex it takes a lot more thought um you have to understand a lot more about i think about

1119
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:25,680
certain things because i i think it's not that it's not that leftist ideas are necessarily more

1120
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:30,960
complicated it's that they're more ubiquitous you know what i mean it's like it's here it's like

1121
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:35,680
you know what is your your stereotype of a conservative it's like a you know like a you

1122
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:40,400
know a redneck living in a flyover state who's kind of an educated he might be a bigot right

1123
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:46,160
he's kind of an easy enemy to attack in a sense like what is your average left-leaning person

1124
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:52,960
well he generally higher IQ generally makes more money lives in a more affluent area he seems to

1125
01:51:52,960 --> 01:52:02,960
have more markers of success going his way it is in terms of philosophy leftism i think is in a

1126
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:10,320
stronger position than rightism and so it requires more in-depth critiques i think i i hear with i

1127
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:15,120
hear what you're saying and i agree with you the problem with leftism is a more interesting

1128
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:22,240
conversation i i think the reason i think a problem i see consistently on your channels i

1129
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:28,240
think you really underestimate the cultural power of the right i just went to south carolina

1130
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:33,840
to debate john doyle i talked to a lot of students on campus i talked to a lot of people down there

1131
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:39,680
in the south it was really conservative and i think that uh your vantage point of living in

1132
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:45,200
canada and having your perceptions of the country primarily filtered through media i think if you

1133
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:51,520
had worked in election cycle in ohio or new hampshire i think that that would really change

1134
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:58,080
your perception very very quickly yes it also might be the case that um canada does not have

1135
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:03,680
the same kind of right wing that america does yeah well i think that's that's just also a you

1136
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:08,800
big like just a true statement right yes obviously canada the right wing and america right wing i

1137
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:14,400
think are not in the same place and now you can point to some um overlap i know that canada

1138
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:20,080
canadians often complain about how american politics kind of seeps over the border a little

1139
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:26,320
bit uh and influences their uh electorate and things like that i i yeah it's just different

readers um and he's been making blog posts about sucked on left and brianna will brianna will you

1163
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:57,600

1164
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:03,040
looking forward to that he is so smart and so thoughtful i really appreciate him well he's

1165
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:08,320
he's very left-leaning right but i think he sees a lot of the same well what's the title of his

1166
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:14,960
latest piece give me uh let me get get it up a second it's basically uh yes it's possible to

1167
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:22,560
imagine progressive dystopias so he has seen a lot and been very critical of the left the far left's

1168
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:28,000
response some among the far left's response to the october seventh thing and so he has really

1169
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:34,160
come out and stood against that so it should be a fun and interesting discussion he's also so pro

1170
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:40,880
national security very very smart on national security i'm not in this war hawk like you know

1171
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:47,200
let's bomb our way to utopia kind of way like really thoughtful about uh you know what our

1172
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:53,920
investment in the military gets us the good sides the downsides our need to you know think about uh

1173
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:59,120
when we're talking america withdrawing from the world uh what happens when china and russia uh

1174
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:04,240
go into the power vacuum just just a really thoughtful person so i'm really looking forward

1175
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:10,000
to this i'm very very curious uh ten dollars from artemis fowl can anyone tell me why lefties are

1176
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,360
up in arms about giving palestinians a state slash one state but don't say anything about

1177
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:22,080
kurtistan or tibet seems like progs are simply hypocritical i for one remember when free tibet

1178
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:30,080
was the left's reason to tear right like they were very big on free tibet um i i don't know

1179
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:37,600
uh to answer your question i'm not sure uh what do you think what do i think about that uh

1180
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:44,480
uh no i really agree with that i think that there's something

1181
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:52,160
i i don't want to accuse people of like it only being about anti-semitism but it's hard to not

1182
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:57,360
notice that some people are being held to a different rule set uh when it comes to this so

1183
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:04,160
maybe a more charitable answer would be that looking at the uh you know oppressor oppressed

1184
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:09,840
dynamics and having that be your pathway to coming with every single answer is not always

1185
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:17,360
a very good way to do it probably so welcome back i'm back i'm back yeah i know honestly

1186
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:23,360
i think when it comes to tibet it's honestly because 20 years ago china was not nearly as

1187
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:27,680
powerful as it is now that's simply that's just it and you think because they are now

1188
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:32,880
a major power that the left has stopped uh they're they're a major power and there's

1189
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:38,240
multiple avenues for them to morally browbeat people who are far left they can use the race

1190
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:43,440
angle they can use the socialist angle it's very easy for them to say to say whatever it is to to

1191
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:48,160
get them to stop talking about tibet because that was like a leftist cause 20 years ago yeah

1192
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:56,160
absolutely free tibet was a big thing um i know that brianna had questions just a couple questions

1193
01:58:56,160 --> 01:59:02,800
okay i want you to look over here do you see this corner my office that is an original parasite

1194
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:11,200
poster from uh japan and that is the original final fantasy 8 poster from japan those cost me

1195
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:19,040
an ungodly amount of money so i wanted to ask uh why are these both uh uh these this is the

1196
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:23,200
soundtrack to your channel so i've always wanted to ask you is parasite eve like is that an

1197
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:30,240
important game for you the same way it is for me um i don't know how important it is i don't

1198
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:35,600
think it's on my top 10 but it's really it's on my top 20 for sure as far as the soundtrack it's

1199
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:42,480
got to be in the top oh so so when i'm choosing soundtracks i'm i'm looking for something that

1200
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:48,320
fits a specific not it's not droning droning is not the right word but it's kind of like droning

1201
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:55,200
where it's almost like investigative all right so i use yeah that's why i use the timber soundtrack

1202
01:59:56,160 --> 02:00:01,040
well that was uninvestigated that was goofy yeah right okay but but like parasite even a lot of

1203
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:06,640
parasite eve tracks um the police station for sure and also the central park track yes those

1204
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:11,840
are both they both feel like you're in an investigation so i use those for for investigative

1205
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:17,920
videos oh i was hoping you were a huge fan that's so sad no i i am a huge fan but i'm not like

1206
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:24,320
they're like man it is in my top 20 so i guess i am like a pretty big fan but i'm not like the top

1207
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:29,600
tier of fan if that makes sense okay fair enough my favorite game of all time is earthbound which

1208
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:35,760
is a very lefty answer i love earthbound good game i have an original earthbound and i don't

1209
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,720
even want to tell you how much i spent on that is it is it inbox with with the book no no i don't

1210
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:47,600
do that i i have games to play so um but uh yeah i love that thing oh my gosh i think you know

1211
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:53,520
it like for all this talk about like making america great again i think that there's a

1212
02:00:53,520 --> 02:01:00,000
political movement based on just bringing back the greatness to the video game industry of that ps1

1213
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,560
square soft era of games which gave you vagrant story which gave you ein hander which is this

1214
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:13,360
under valued amazing ps1 shooter with the most amazing soundtrack like all the final fantasies

1215
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:19,200
final fantasy tactics all of these games make a movement to like bring that back to the game

1216
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:24,800
industry and i don't even care if it's fascism i will be on board with that i miss that so much

1217
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:30,560
yeah there were some good games and man their attempts to like redo it they're really hit and

1218
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:34,480
miss like you go play like oh yeah traveler yeah like upper hill is pretty good but it's not the

1219
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:40,480
same as like final fantasy 6 it lacks it kind of it's hard to put my finger on right it's

1220
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:50,960
the certain if you will it just it feels too formulaic too clean too um too processed i guess

1221
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,800
when you're playing octopax traveler it's the fact that you can play as all the characters

1222
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:58,560
or none at any point in time so they can't have any meaningful interactions with each other

1223
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:04,720
so it's always like a lack of meaningful choice is what you're saying to me no not choice

1224
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:09,760
interactions so if you play like like a final fantasy 6 or a final fantasy 7 the characters

1225
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,360
are always going to have the same interactions at the same point in the story right yeah you

1226
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:17,920
play it multiple times if you play octopath traveler because you can get you can recruit

1227
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,560
the characters in any order you want all of their plot lines happen independently of each other

1228
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:26,400
and they never had the characters never feel like they're actually on an adventure together

1229
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:31,680
and that's a big problem um second big problem is that the writing is just needs to be edited down

1230
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:35,760
there's like three times too much dialogue in octopath and i think that's because like

1231
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:41,360
if you're thinking back to like the ps1 or the snes you're uh like and you're thinking back to

1232
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:44,800
when you were like nine years old or something because i was i was pretty young when those games

1233
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:50,640
came out the it feels like in your memory there's way more dialogue than there actually is yeah if

1234
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:54,720
you go back to like final fantasy 6 right now and just like emulate it and speed through it there's

1235
02:02:54,720 --> 02:03:00,960
not much dialogue not really um but it felt like a lot as a kid so to get the same feel they just

1236
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:06,480
bloat the dialogue up in a game like octopath traveling just way too much i don't i feel like

1237
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:12,400
one of the things that made final fantasy 6 so good is they really thought about the amount of

1238
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:17,040
grinding that you have to do one of the reasons 8 is so great is because grinding doesn't do

1239
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:22,240
anything for you in final fantasy 8 and you can actually like you can do a final fantasy 6 play

1240
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:28,880
through in 10 hours if you know where you're going so i think i think these games are so bloated

1241
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:35,440
nowadays that they lose a lot of that magic in my view yeah i think a lot of the bloat really

1242
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:40,000
comes from the fact that when you were a kid you know 60 hours seemed like a lot more than

1243
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,520
it does when you're an adult yeah and also you know that was your one game for like six months

1244
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:51,600
or something if you get anymore yeah um i like all the same games that you do well you mentioned

1245
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:57,200
earlier in this conversation right like the it's the um too much access i think that maybe

1246
02:03:57,200 --> 02:04:03,680
too with games is the same thing yeah too much it's also um fifty dollars just real quick fifty

1247
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:08,960
dollars for mark swain's revenge uh do you guys think that fundamentalist islam which compels

1248
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:15,280
men to emulate the prophet muhammad is inherently dangerous for all non-fundamentalist islamists

1249
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:25,760
it's a spicy one that's pretty spicy anyone want to take a crack at it well so i mean the answer

1250
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:29,840
is going to be yes on some level and you can make the same argument for other religions like every

1251
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:35,760
religion has its fanatical version that is dangerous to other people um i think islam might

1252
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:42,720
be unique because it carries within it a doctrine of how to set up a religious state and most

1253
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:48,640
religions don't have that in their in their doctrine so it might be uniquely dangerous

1254
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:50,960
that doesn't mean obviously that all muslims are dangerous or anything like that

1255
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:57,280
i think that if you got out into the world and the democratic party you would see that at least

1256
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:02,480
here in this country a lot of the muslim americans that are here are some of the most progressive

1257
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:08,000
thoughtful smart kind loving people that you will ever meet in your whole life um you know like jink

1258
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:14,880
is not um he's not muslim like extremist when it comes down to it so uh i'm not comfortable

1259
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:20,480
i'm not comfortable with blanket statements like that i think that um a lot of muslim countries

1260
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:26,720
are not democracies uh and i think that uh that obviously causes a lot of problems and repression

1261
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:31,600
i mean it's the same it's it's the same that canada doesn't we have like a huge muslim population

1262
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:36,320
but we have a very big sikh population it's the same with them right like their their religion

1263
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:41,520
is overall very peaceful and yet canada has recently had like the sikh terrorist issues

1264
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:45,280
which probably didn't make it into the american news but like there's there's stuff happening

1265
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:49,920
up here that well they uh they uh assassinated that's not all sikhs obviously uh i think

1266
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:58,400
india uh struck them like killed one of the sikhs in canada i believe is yeah yeah so the tldr the

1267
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:04,320
tldr that is that the sikhs want like an and they want an ethno state for the sikh religion in india

1268
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:08,480
in an area called calistan they're trying to break it off the indian government obviously

1269
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:15,440
doesn't want that um there is a big i i think i think the violence hit its peak in 85 when they

1270
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:24,400
blew up a flight going to canada all right well okay real real quick the tldr is that a bunch of

1271
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:29,200
the calisthenian um extremists moved to canada they kind of blended in because canadians are

1272
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:32,800
like they're very they're very nice and polite and open and welcoming from their country so of

1273
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:37,360
course come here of course not knowing what was actually happening and so now there is this this

1274
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:45,040
growing calisthenian issue in canada where canada might be harboring some legit terrorists and india

1275
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:49,600
has now um assassinated one of them on canadian soil which has caused an international incident

1276
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:53,520
absolutely so that's something happening here that americans aren't americans aren't paying

1277
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:59,360
attention to it it's happening right real quick five dollars is lizam right about women that is

1278
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:08,640
a troll obviously not our artemis fowl i know him he donates a lot of money yes he trolls every

1279
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:14,560
single time i am okay with that uh but you had a question a last question and we have some colors

1280
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:20,160
backstage gang if you want to get uh in line uh well they were backstage where they go uh

1281
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:24,160
exclamation point discord and chat or click the link that i provide in the youtube chat

1282
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:28,800
uh accept the rules and then jump backstage and we'll pull you on one at a time to talk to these

1283
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:35,440
wonderful individuals but go ahead last uh i'm good to go let's get to the colors oh no no it

1284
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:41,440
was like a video game question maybe uh i it's covered it's cool i'm cool oh okay okay okay um

1285
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:46,160
actually i i have a question for you then okay like you're very clearly a squaresoft fan yes

1286
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:52,560
yeah okay um you like earthbound so you have to like rpgs probably like chrono trigger as well

1287
02:07:52,560 --> 02:08:01,680
yeah it's really good it's really good yeah um how about like like western rpgs like vampire the

1288
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:06,800
masquerade bloodlines that's considered a classic it's good i've never done a complete playthrough

1289
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:13,040
of it i mean does mass effect count as a western rpg i think that's the greatest video game ever

1290
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:19,760
made i mean which one uh well two is obviously the best but all three of them in order i mean

1291
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:24,000
come on that's the greatest story our our industry has ever produced in my view

1292
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:27,840
i uh i keep everyone says two is the best i think one is better than two

1293
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:36,000
this story is better but the gameplay is not i i like that old style of kind of

1294
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:42,160
uncompromisingly janky gameplay well which class do you play because i do uh assassin

1295
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:48,160
and sniper rifle so maybe that's why we have a different perspective uh engineer so i've

1296
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:54,480
never done an engineer play through how does that work um well in the in the future games you get

1297
02:08:54,480 --> 02:09:01,040
drones and you get turrets and those are those are really nice you can basically like there's

1298
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:05,520
a way to play mass effect where it's basically the loneliest shepherd where you recruit as few

1299
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:10,320
people as possible you kill off as many partners as possible and you go it alone for as much as

1300
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:15,200
the game and you play in engineers that all you have are like robot buddies it's a really fun

1301
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:20,320
way to play the game but like it's everyone is dead and you can actually pretty much break the

1302
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:23,680
game by the end of the playthrough in mass effect 3 because the game doesn't know what to do because

1303
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:29,120
everyone's gone so if you're on vermyer you're sending ashley and caden to go die basically

1304
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:38,160
um okay what one last question yes how about how about deadly premonition i i don't know this game

1305
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:44,640
what are you talking about it is a horror game from the 360 yes i remember this this is the one

1306
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:51,440
where paranoia affects your your sense of stuff right uh no okay i'm thinking something else no

1307
02:09:52,240 --> 02:10:01,360
uh it's basically twin peaks the game oh my god and i i i definitely have like a hipster sense

1308
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:06,400
of taste when it comes to uh to to games and tv and movies so i love twin peaks

1309
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:10,240
i love that whole aesthetic and that that's that type of storytelling and deadly premonition is

1310
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:14,080
twin peaks the game it recently got a switch re-release you can play it on modern consoles but

1311
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:21,520
it's it's like unfinished and kind of comedically it's comedically unfinished but the charm of the

1312
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:27,520
game is just it's over the top i love it it's it's on my list of top 10 it's twin peaks yeah

1313
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:31,440
i like it when your channel talks about games you had a really salient thoughtful

1314
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:36,640
analysis of final fantasy 16 that uh i i didn't agree with all your conclusions but i thought

1315
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:41,840
it was a really interesting thought uh like analysis of the plot and the the political

1316
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:50,400
subtext of it so i wish you'd do more of that there's one coming tomorrow oh fancy okay so yeah

1317
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:56,880
the tldr of it is basically um there's this idea that conservatives they they're media illiterate

1318
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:01,280
you know we're talking about this before before before we started the idea is like they they watch

1319
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:06,560
the boys and they see homelander and then they like seal clap not recognizing that it's it's

1320
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:12,080
criticizing america and criticizing like american like exceptionalism right and there's probably a

1321
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:19,040
lot of truth to that at the same time though there's this view again mainly among breadtubers

1322
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:24,240
all right it's it's it is it is leftist crazies who are terminally online they believe that like

1323
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:28,880
all media and all all entertainment media has messages that are exclusively for them and

1324
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:34,720
if conservatives enjoy something that they're um they're coping or they're like intellectually

1325
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:38,880
dishonest or they have some sort of dissonance in their heads and it's like no no there are

1326
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:43,920
actually good conservative stories right legend of zelda i gave you the example legend of zelda

1327
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:48,080
is a conservative story because in every single game link is restoring the monarchy all right

1328
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:54,240
there is a there is a hard conservative subtext in legend of zelda for sure so i'm i'm i'm making

1329
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:59,760
the argument libtards coping and ceasing right now i i'm making the argument that there are

1330
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:06,560
definitely like anon is authoritarian though anon is authoritarian yeah of course he is yeah

1331
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:11,520
yeah but i mean authoritarianism isn't isn't exclusively a rightist thing and monarchy is

1332
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:16,400
certainly a monarchy is certainly exclusively a rightist thing every single time link puts

1333
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:21,440
princess zelda back on the throne that is reaffirming monarchy it's unclear how much

1334
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:27,760
political power zelda actually holds i am i am not prepared for this debate but fair enough let's do

1335
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:31,760
it um but let me read these first five dollars from tempered squeal for giving me lovely

1336
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:37,040
background noise while i work love the conversation and five pounds from conus x

1337
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:41,440

1338
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:49,440

1339
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:54,960
with is it is it what is it called like it's called the dark something that universe i don't

1340
02:12:54,960 --> 02:13:01,520

1353
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:12,080
hello a lot

1354
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:21,680
hey guys how you doing um hi it's too friendly in here i i'm gonna try to get you guys to fight

1355
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:28,400
with each other a little bit uh no i'm just kidding uh i mean maybe um my question is mainly

1356
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:34,720
brianna esta if you want to answer you can you guys like briefly touched on cancel culture earlier

1357
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:41,600
i was just curious uh brianna if if you see any um because to me there's a there's a pretty

1358
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:47,120
discernible party line between the type of emotion that the phrase cancel culture like evokes in

1359
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:52,480
people um you know like like people right-leaning conservatives tend to think of it as like the

1360
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:59,200
villain the big bad bogey and then um left-leaning people generally see it as like a dog whistle for

1361
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:05,200
basically anti-wokeness or anti-progressivism um as a figure of yourself do you see any um

1362
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:09,840
can you identify any concerning aspects of cancel culture like what it's done to progressives

1363
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:17,200
oh um yeah first of all i think this is one of these things where no one is taking a long enough

1364
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:22,160
historical view of this i'm old enough to remember what happened to people that spoke out against the

1365
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:28,800
iraq war of which i was one of them right and there was a very real sense if you spoke out

1366
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:35,920
against president bush right after 9 11 that you would lose your job um you know there was um so

1367
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:42,640
i think the conservatives have been running you know cancel culture for a long time um yeah i

1368
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:48,320
think i have a different assessment i don't um i do think i i actually want higher standards for

1369
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:54,960
people in how we express ourselves publicly but i think uh it's really obvious that this current

1370
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:01,920
playbook of trying to get everyone fired over the most minor statements and just making witch hunt

1371
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:08,560
witch hunt witch hunt the uh way that we advocate for change it's it's not working uh i think a lot

1372
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:14,560
of people think progressives are assholes uh now i think that we have less cultural power today than

1373
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:22,240
we did 10 years ago and um i i think there is certainly an illiberal element to this you know

1374
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:27,600
i think that no matter your views at the end of the day we're a democracy we need to settle our

1375
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:32,960
differences at the ballot box and i think there does need to be more tolerance for allowing people

1376
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:39,440
on the other side to have their say so um i realize that's a more nuanced uh view than just

1377
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:48,160
cancel culture bad but this stuff is really like free speech is this there's a lot it really matters

1378
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:53,600
how you approach that principle and how you safeguard it right just to give one super quick

1379
02:16:53,600 --> 02:17:00,400
example when it comes to national security we all agree with free speech but like russia is

1380
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:07,040
weaponizing our ideals against us and by using bot farms to exacerbate our divisions here in

1381
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:12,160
this country make it seem like things are more inflamed than they are and now the new warfare

1382
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:17,040
against the united states is it happens with trying to basically inflame these differences

1383
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:22,640
between people what is the answer for that like we can't like start just censoring uh people

1384
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:28,080
disagreeing with each other but we should certainly have a policy to like identify bot farms

1385
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:37,840
um so all this stuff is really complicated um okay do you do you care more about progressives

1386
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:44,640
looking like assholes or do you care more about um potential like sustained casualties from um

1387
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:49,360
people catching strays i guess from uh from as a result of cancel culture and what it's done to

1388
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:56,160
progressivism i genuinely care about both um i think both are extremely high downsides

1389
02:17:56,160 --> 02:18:00,000
like on a priority list i would say both of those are an a-level priority

1390
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:06,720
okay so do you agree with your honor we were do you have a more um negative outlook on it

1391
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:13,520
um you have to repeat a little bit sorry i spaced i'm just curious

1392
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:21,920
uh so beyond has identified uh basically that uh cancel culture uh oh why don't you i don't want to

1393
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:27,040
um brianne if you could give them a summation it started with dixie chicks basically or like

1394
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,720
not didn't start but like the right was doing it earlier and you had like dixie chicks that

1395
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:36,000
could get canceled i remember that from back in the day yeah yeah um but i do think freezing it

1396
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,440
as conservatives have been running cancel culture for a long time is probably not the

1397
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:44,960
most accurate way of characterizing it i don't think this is the dark part of the human heart

1398
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:50,960
it's no one side has political power gamergate was about cancel culture in a large way against

1399
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:57,520
feminists in the game industry i mean everyone's gonna like everyone's gonna say like i'm against

1400
02:18:57,520 --> 02:19:03,120
cancel culture but here's my political opponent and here's some evidence that he might have raped

1401
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:08,560
someone so let's get him fired everyone's gonna feel like that's just in the moment right but it

1402
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:14,400
probably isn't especially if the evidence is not good so ah it's it's tough it's one of those

1403
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:21,040
things where it's like do you do you really want to have complete free speech because then you do

1404
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:28,720
get the russian bot farms that like you mentioned before but i don't know i will say there's there's

1405
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:34,640
this sorry go ahead no um i will say this about the whole thing uh we're going to see a lot of

1406
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:39,280
people speaking out rightly so in my opinion i want to be clear this is good that they're

1407
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:43,920
speaking out against it the people losing their jobs over pro-palestinian stances in the coming

1408
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:51,120
months right we're going to see that happen over and over again on the left and if we had not

1409
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:57,040
created the mechanisms to get people fired from their academic jobs for right-wing views right

1410
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:02,800
um we would not be seeing this today at least not at the numbers we are so this is the thing

1411
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:10,720
if we want to be able to say and speak out on controversial important issues we have to keep

1412
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:18,400
that shield strong when people we don't like in fact may hate come out and say things that we hate

1413
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:25,600
or oppose and i think that keeping that shield strong to protect us all is going to be what

1414
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:32,640
gets us out of this mess and we just have to re-return to our roots as a nation and say

1415
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:39,600
i may not respect what you say but i respect your right to say it and i think we need to really

1416
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:44,880
cling to that again um sorry dev i didn't mean to cut you off but i i like free speech is my thing

1417
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:49,920
okay this is what i that like like that that sounds really good but i think there's probably

1418
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:54,080
some logistical problems in there because for example if you like you later on this but go on

1419
02:20:54,880 --> 02:21:00,000
let's say you have two political parties right and you know the political power is being handed

1420
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,240
between them each election and one political party is completely fine with censoring their

1421
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:08,560
opponents so they don't even give a shit the other political party says you know what no free speech

1422
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:13,520
for everyone we're all everyone's gonna we're all gonna play by the same rules you end up you end up

1423
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:19,520
in a position where every time the free speech party takes power their opponents get to run

1424
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:24,720
get to run wild with free speech every time they the free speech party is on the outs

1425
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:29,680
they get censored and it becomes this one-way battle right so you almost have to have a standard

1426
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:36,240
of you're only going to censor the censors in a sense but i think that censorship right uh

1427
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:41,280
in a real way it's cutting off it's getting short-term games absolutely short-term gains

1428
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:46,640
can be gained from it absolutely but i in a very real way i think it undercuts and undermines your

1429
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:51,440
own position so while yes the one party who engages in censorship while the other doesn't

1430
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:56,240
uh short term it's going to have a lot of success when it gets power to be able to censor and cut

1431
02:21:56,240 --> 02:22:01,200
off its enemies but i think at the end of the day like the good guys are good guys for a reason it's

1432
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:06,000
because they don't do the things the bad guys do right um and i know that's a simplistic way

1433
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,400
of looking at it but i think most of my audience are simpletons so we're gonna keep with the

1434
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:18,320
analogy here this is where like respect i know we fight on this but go on you're obviously a

1435
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:22,400
really smart guy but let me give you a really concrete example of where i think it's just a

1436
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:28,400
little bit more complicated than i i think you acknowledge so uh here's a really good example

1437
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:34,960
my good friend carrie gold book's amazing book on this talks about some of her fights to try to get

1438
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:40,960
big tech to do things that are correct when it wasn't in their uh profit interest right she

1439
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:47,360
runs a really great law firm um and one really concrete example of this is someone uh was on

1440
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:55,200
grinder and they had a jilted former boyfriend who sent made a habit day after day after day after

1441
02:22:55,200 --> 02:23:03,120
day of sending random strangers to his house to have sex with him so he would be cooking dinner

1442
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:09,360
somebody would be knocking on the door trying to have sex with him right just did this constantly

1443
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:16,000
she tried everything possible to try to get um basically grinder to expand their own terms of

1444
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:22,000
service and take action against this they just would not do anything about this you know under

1445
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:26,320
hold on like the way you're talking about this like that's a free speech issue they're making

1446
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:32,000
their own account right so i think all of these things if you really dig into the policy of like

1447
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:37,600
ways away 230 is implemented in this country i want to keep 230 but i think the critics have

1448
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:43,600
some real fair points that deserve a policy answer so i think the more you know about this subject

1449
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:49,360
the more complicated all of it actually gets but that's the thing the situation you described isn't

1450
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:54,800
sure speech because speech when i say free speech and absolute free speech i'm thinking the ability

1451
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:59,840
to express ideas without censorship for that what you're describing is something that is different

1452
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:06,880
that i'm fine with um i i we we have no i have no compulsion or compunction with you um engaging in

1453
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:13,680
mechanisms that shut that kind of behavior down because it's a different style of thing now it's

1454
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:20,560
like the heckler's veto right um it's cutting the mic instead of allowing people to speak and there's

1455
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:25,200
a such a difference there but i don't want to hog this conversation up porsche ran away because we

1456
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:30,640
stopped talking to him uh it's color time right um but if you guys question real quick yeah but

1457
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:34,960
if you guys want to just real quick if i may if you guys want to read the best book i've ever read

1458
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:41,680
on free speech kindly inquisitors look it up check it out it's great i forget the author off the top

1459
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:47,520
of my head but kindly inquisitors you can google it and find out um it's a very very good uh

1460
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:52,480
treaties on why free speech matters and why it's important i wanted to ask this but i forgot i've

1461
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:56,720
remembered it was was that the ikea trans shark in the background as well

1462
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:05,920
oh yeah yeah yeah it's wahaj all right yeah yeah okay i figured i thought it was what i

1463
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:11,360
don't know so i just wanted to confirm yeah so i had blachage before blachage was a trans icon

1464
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:17,920
believe it or not there was an article that came out i think it was back in 2017 about ikea

1465
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:22,640
canceling this shark and a whole bunch of russians getting angry about it and i saw

1466
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:27,600
this story of it i was like oh my god that is the cutest thing i've ever seen i've got to get that

1467
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:34,880
shark and then like years later blachage became a huge trans icon so i was in way before the trend

1468
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:44,480
all right okay guys ready for the next caller let's do it speaking of trolling

1469
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:48,560
artemis foul welcome hi artemis what's up you're live how's it going

1470
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:57,840
artemis yes i understand i'm unmuting myself hey hey how's it going how come you're not

1471
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:04,080
involved in the project zomboid server with kibbs i have a a job that is very important

1472
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:08,400
that makes a lot of money do you think i have time to play in the middle of the day when everybody

1473
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:16,880
else is supposed to be at work well that that is our job sorry yeah so i do have a question for

1474
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:25,200
everybody here so the right back in the day in the 90s was pearl clutching about you know evil

1475
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:32,080
satanists and stuff like this and doing the slippery slippery slope argument of they're

1476
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:36,240
going to destroy everything or it's the end times that the left gets what they want right

1477
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:43,200
now seeing how far the left has gone in terms of its policies and enacting them

1478
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:48,720
would we say more or less that the right was correct in that where it was heading or

1479
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:58,240
or is it not because for my example c.s lewis talks about the moral tyrant right that never

1480
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:04,800
sleeps whereas the the republicans are evil in a lot of aspects but at least at some point they

1481
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:12,640
stop messing with you they have so go ahead i mean no we'll finish your question then we'll

1482
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:20,000
respond i promise is is the it was is the right was the right correct about the slippery slope

1483
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,920
of the left because from what everybody can see in the last 10 years the slippery slope is not

1484
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:32,240
no longer a fallacy but just a an inevitability at this point can i help you with it can i help you

1485
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:36,320
out with an example go ahead so i i think i don't think i agree with you but i think i know what

1486
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:41,920
you're getting at okay so there was definitely this idea back when it was uh being uh gay

1487
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:47,440
marriage is being debated is that if if we if we allow gay marriage they're going to be having sex

1488
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:51,520
with animals they're going to be having sex with children they're going to be doing all this weird

1489
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:55,120
shit and that was that was the right wing argument and everyone back then you know kind of rolled

1490
02:27:55,120 --> 02:28:00,560
their eyes and said okay grandma like this is obviously stupid right and now you have a lot

1491
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:07,360
of right wing accounts online that are promoting instances and they in my opinion they're isolated

1492
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:12,240
instances but they are bad instances of let's say trans people doing weird things with children

1493
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:18,320
and i think even though that's that's i think it's a minority of instances it's enough and it's been

1494
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:23,600
amplified enough that right wingers are currently saying we were right the whole time is that what

1495
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:29,120
you're getting at basically well the right wingers will say that but i'm just saying is it can anybody

1496
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:34,480
see the argument there i can see the argument but i don't think i agree with it necessarily

1497
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:40,640
i think both sides have you know slid more and more and more into extremes and i think uh

1498
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:46,640
probably one of the failures uh is i've engaged this tonight i think we haven't acknowledged how

1499
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:53,600
crazy the republicans are now some absurdly high number of republicans nowadays don't even believe

1500
02:28:53,600 --> 02:29:00,000
in democracy when when mitt romney that's not my opinion that's mitt romney's opinion when he

1501
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:06,560
resigned from the from the senate right so um i'm not gonna tell you that the hyperbole of my own

1502
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:14,480
side does not go to crazy town it does it absolutely does but i don't think that issue is

1503
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:20,640
limited to to one side i'm not gonna um i'm not gonna tell you who but it was a pretty famous

1504
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:26,080
person on the right and i was talking to this person the other day they were telling me how

1505
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:33,440
uh with their algorithm when they go on to instagram it's like recipe of how to make a bomb

1506
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:40,240
like recipe on how to like create your own like flammables for a riot right like it's this

1507
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:46,800
constant deluge of stuff to literally bring out an insurrection right and just how stunning they

1508
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:54,080
feel about how their own side is behaving so um like i think dev i know you have a really good

1509
02:29:54,080 --> 02:30:00,000
video criticizing this word reactionary and i know i'm misusing it according to your definition here

1510
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,920
but i do think that all of us are coming just so emotionally charged in the way we

1511
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:10,400
respond to each other it's it's it's leading some really crazy stuff

1512
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:21,360
what about you wick well i talk a lot about on my channel about reciprocal radicalization

1513
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:27,120
and how both sides have driven as brianna said each other into more and more extremes because

1514
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:33,440
they have to fight the other side so when you talk about like um was the right correct that

1515
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:42,880
the left was going to go this direction um yes and no but it's it's a self-fulfilling prophecy

1516
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:48,880
because i'm very they are they have created this monster they are responsible for this monster in

1517
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:55,920
a lot of ways um and i don't think they can solely take blame obviously right i think the left has

1518
02:30:55,920 --> 02:31:03,920
autonomy um but at the end of the day there is a party of sanity still and i i say it's squarely

1519
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:11,120
on and most issues the democrats um republicans they're again they're i i don't want to i don't

1520
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:16,880
want to like i have a large republican audience right they are not crazy they're sane but their

1521
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:23,920
leadership and a lot of the policy positions that have been pushed by some of these people are out

1522
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:28,640
of the out of out of this this world now that isn't to say that the left doesn't also have

1523
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:34,160
crazy policies that they pass or push right like this idea that they're going to to remove

1524
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:41,360
standards for eighth graders on um you know uh math or Washington and things like that right it's

1525
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:48,320
it's it's again for a very specific group of people sure yeah yeah but they are they are it's

1526
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:54,560
a it's a there it's a tit for tat right it's a tip for tat we have to go hard because if we don't

1527
02:31:54,560 --> 02:32:02,560
go hard they're gonna go hard like mansion has decided not to run again because he's gotten so

1528
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:09,280
he again this man joe mansion i'm gonna stand him for a little bit right he got it a huge uh

1529
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:15,440
win for energy for american energy past he also was again an important seat he voted progressive

1530
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:23,200
what 90 of the time and but because he didn't vote for it a hundred percent he got crucified

1531
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:30,480
and that's not going to make the next replacement be less radical right or uh it's not that's the

1532
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:34,640
argument against joe mansion i think i think the issue is is that most people in the left

1533
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:40,960
thinking it was a blue dog and a republican in a uh an all but name it's the corruption

1534
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:47,680
it's the outright corruption in the uh medical industry well i think that you know like

1535
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:53,760
ruling on issues of like uh basically the use of fossil fuels and sabotaging bills while he's

1536
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:57,760
actually owning one of those companies i think that's pretty outright corruption

1537
02:32:57,760 --> 02:33:02,320
do you think that no but do you think oh brianna come on you you don't think that when the left

1538
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:07,840
criticizes mansion that's not what they're criticizing at least that's not what i see

1539
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:13,840
that's not there's certainly a portion of the left that does that but um you know we are a

1540
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:20,080
political party and when one person is sabotaging you know our president's efforts to get certain

1541
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:25,760
legislation passed i think he should expect blowback i mean mansion certainly gets this i

1542
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:31,680
mean this is democracy functioning but mansions replace like we have cut okay no this is where

1543
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:37,280
i agree with uh matt matty glacius right he talks about how mansions and the problem is that we need

1544
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:43,600
a lot more mansions the and hold on before progressive tour crucifies me the problem is the

1545
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:49,840
senate is like as a structure is fundamentally stacked against the democrats it always will be

1546
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:54,000
this is the reason we have a bicameral system in the first place in this country is because they

1547
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:01,040
knew that uh you know they wanted to have uh continue slavery and they knew um that if you

1548
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:05,600
leave these issues up to just the popular will the people they're a lot of powerful interests

1549
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:10,800
are going to be crushed the senate is fundamentally stacked in favor of the republicans so if you have

1550
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:17,360
more moderate people out there that we're growing to be able to win some of these states that are

1551
02:34:17,360 --> 02:34:24,160
more conservative leaning like west virginia that will over time give democrats more power and i

1552
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:29,520
agree with that hold on there's there's definitely better arguments for the existence of the senate

1553
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:35,520
as it currently stands in that though yes it serves a good function yeah the senate the senate

1554
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:43,280
is there to tamper uh tampin expectations on like situations of high intense fervor from passing

1555
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:49,760
through the the lower house that the house and then that's the that's the whole point is just

1556
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:54,640
for change incrementally so that people don't go and say and start a war that destroys the

1557
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:59,040
nation that's the whole point of the senate and to provide some type of check and balances

1558
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:05,760
against large population centers look i i look i am an institutionalist at my core i don't have

1559
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:10,400
a big problem with the senate i'm talking about a strategy about how the democrats can get more

1560
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:15,760
power uh you know if mansion stepping down we don't have candidates on deck that are moderate

1561
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:22,240
that can win in west virginia so um i would love like don't get me wrong i'm a pro-abortion

1562
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:28,720
pro-feminist uh progressive but i think if we are interested in keeping the senate it makes sense to

1563
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:34,240
have candidates on deck on those states that we can run and win and get political power for

1564
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:39,200
ourselves so i got a question on the ohio thing oh one last question but we do have a uh do have a

1565
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:45,120
line so yeah one last thing i'll get you so why do you think that the ohio abortion thing is a

1566
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:51,600
knock against uh republicans what do you mean because republicans are staunchly about letting

1567
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:57,280
states decide abortion rather than allowing the overall federal government to make a sweeping

1568
02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:03,040
judgment on it uh i think that it is going to be terrible look this if you want to make this

1569
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:07,840
an abortion question it's going to take a whole hour so not about the abortion but about the

1570
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:12,000
allowing the states to the individual state to decide their own policies it's terrible for

1571
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:16,640
women's public health this is a right men would never allow a law like this to be passed about

1572
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:22,800
their own bodies it is leading to terrible outcomes and like it's horrible top to bottom

1573
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:27,680
so i do not support that okay that's fair i was just going to say that that argument would have

1574
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:34,240
had valid before 2020 and the covered lockdown but the but that that covered lockdown destroyed

1575
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:40,880
that argument because nobody cared about self self uh choice when it comes to medical procedures

1576
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:47,440
oh during that time so okay this might be it's true this might be its own thing no that's fine

1577
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:54,560
you know me yeah thank you for your statement on that that's it i i i just wanted to know but

1578
02:36:54,560 --> 02:37:01,760
thank you okay um and val thank you for coming on and thank you for the super chats uh so here's the

1579
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:08,560
thing i can considering what i know about artemis's job i know that he's a glowy if you know what that

1580
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:15,360
means he's actually yeah he actually is a glowy yeah okay that that would actually be an interesting

1581
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:19,440
conversation you and him because you probably both know way more about the american government

1582
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:26,640
than i do sure so because he actually does work in in it to some i i can't talk about how but he

1583
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:32,240
does he has are you doxing are you doxing this guy is this no no i am not okay i just don't

1584
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:38,400
want you to like oh i know that guy here's his address and name and he he has overthrown several

1585
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:44,720
south american dictatorships i'm not anti-law enforcement kind of gal i mean you know i've

1586
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:49,440
worked with the fbi multiple occasions of multiple projects at this point you know when

1587
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:55,280
my congressional campaign was hacked by russia they stepped in and was really impressed by the

1588
02:37:55,280 --> 02:38:01,280
skill of their cyber security team i think it's really important for national security right so

1589
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:09,120
um was actually hacked by russia yeah how do you know that because i can't get into it but i do

1590
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:16,000
know this okay there are new stories about it go read them okay fair enough okay yeah uh next caller

1591
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:19,280
soy addle hello

1592
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:29,360
soy addle soy addle oh there he goes uh oh he's gone don't click the join voice button

1593
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:35,680
don't click it i'm sorry discord silly um unmute yourself and go go ahead yeah

1594
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:45,920
so dev when did gamergate actually start was it like pax 2014 was it uh a week before

1595
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:50,240
when adam baldwin tweeted about gamergate or was it long before then

1596
02:38:53,440 --> 02:39:00,240
what why are you a shark i figured i'd telegraph my position as and trigger you a little bit

1597
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:05,200
oh jeez when did like when did it start i don't fucking know dude was it when adam baldwin tweeted

1598
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:10,000
gamergate was that like because that was like it didn't have a name was it wasn't a nameless

1599
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:14,800
movement before then or it was like it was it was the same movement but it probably it was

1600
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:19,040
nothing less before then yeah but it was a movement yeah so so we we've got a narrative

1601
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:24,240
that that's coming from the author of the gamer gate book that uh you had to be a time traveler

1602
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:30,320
that you had to be a time traveler to do everything that has been attributed to gamergate

1603
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:36,880
and this kind of debunks that so if it was a movement before adam baldwin then that narrative

1604
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:42,480
doesn't play out and i want to make sure that we're honest about that yeah so all right what

1605
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:51,120
was what was sort of this the the the the incentive the uh sorry the the spark that set off

1606
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:56,320
yeah it was the most it was the zoe post right okay so no well but then you're saying i don't

1607
02:39:56,320 --> 02:40:01,200
agree with that by the way i think it was adam baldwin and and all that that's when we got the

1608
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:08,000
name in in my view i think uh zoe is incorrectly uh credited as the catalyst for game again i

1609
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:13,200
actually think it started with amita sarkeesian before then and a feminist frequency gang founded

1610
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:20,080
because right after that what is not historically recognized is how that playbook immediately

1611
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:25,840
started bleeding over into the personal lives of women in the game industry they've been talking

1612
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:31,600
about equality so um yeah i think that's when it started i i can only tell you what i remember

1613
02:40:32,560 --> 02:40:37,520
i remember you know you know hanging out in 4chan and anita was making videos and everyone was

1614
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:40,880
shitting on her and saying these are bad videos she doesn't know what she's talking about she's

1615
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:49,680
not a real gamer all that was happening but i don't remember any sort of like consistent united

1616
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:56,320
until the zoe post dropped and then until like the next day or two when you had a bunch of those

1617
02:40:56,320 --> 02:41:02,000
gamers or dead articles drop that's when i i remember specifically everyone coming together

1618
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:06,720
to be like there's something wrong here yeah so from inside hold on just one second because i

1619
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:12,000
love this uh there's an article i wrote just before all of that stuff happened it's called

1620
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:18,720
no skin is thick enough uh for polygon i was told at the time that was the third most read piece for

1621
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:26,320
that year um and this was before the zoe post it was talking about the horror and shit show

1622
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:32,640
that was happening to women in the game industry um you know starting with uh samantha allen

1623
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:38,000
basically quitting the entire game industry because of the doxing and harassment that she got

1624
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:44,160
uh there's just been erased from all of this so um i i hear you and i believe you when you say

1625
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:48,080
that you weren't really aware of that but women in the game industry

1626
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:53,920
were it was really really bad for us two dollars to tell uh soya to put the shark back but uh go

1627
02:41:53,920 --> 02:42:00,160
ahead okay well i'll get your two dollars back later but basically if um you know from my

1628
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:05,840
perspective being in a different part of the games industry yeah it it there were conversations

1629
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:13,840
around how do we expand the customers how do we get away from the toxic xbox call of duty crowd

1630
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:21,040
and this is where the gamers are dead sentiment was built i know that we had like the journal

1631
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:26,560
the journal list conspiracy which which was kind of proven and i've seen like different

1632
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:34,880
groups of people in media gather in private messages but then of course we also had similar

1633
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:42,400
things happen political organizing in 2016 so we we no one's innocent here from from like this

1634
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:49,760
collusion back back channels but it certainly did sort of like this overall position of the

1635
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:57,360
industry pushing for expanded customer base dismantling the aggression like dick wolves

1636
02:42:57,360 --> 02:43:04,320
episode and all of this was pressing on industry to perform its image and i think that's why even

1637
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:10,160
if it was coordinated behind the scenes that's why we did have sentiment redefine gamers somehow

1638
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:15,680
and just one more word on this um because i really i have nothing new to say on gamergate but just to

1639
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:20,960
to tackle what you're talking about people miss this historic part of the industry because this

1640
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:27,280
was when mobile started eating the lunch of triple a studios before gamergate one of this

1641
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:33,360
bad game that i still enjoy it's called alpha protocol it's a mass effect clone i was made by

1642
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:39,760
sega i think the budget was like 20 million dollars or something this was this b-tier game

1643
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:45,920
that the game industry was able to produce just a few years before gamergate but mobile started

1644
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:52,080
changing it so much that we were looking for new audiences and we were realizing we couldn't keep

1645
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:57,040
talking to the exact same kind of people making these same kind of games because development was

1646
02:43:57,040 --> 02:44:03,040
getting more expensive audiences were looking for something new so i like a lot of this stuff that

1647
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:08,720
got the core gamer so angry i i don't want to sound like a communist but it was capitalism

1648
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:13,840
right it was this force in the game industry to like find new people to buy your stuff

1649
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:20,080
i mean that's true to an extent um this is something i'm trying to i'm trying to work out

1650
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:26,240
in my head oh god and it's a it's much more complicated for this for this conversation um

1651
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:33,280
capitalism and communism don't really operate in the kind of dichotomy that most people think

1652
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:40,800
that it does you know because your answer to this question capitalism is okay fair enough go ahead

1653
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:48,160
well they they they both have like universalizing forces within them right because capitalism wants

1654
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:55,280
to um as you said in increase the consumer base in order to do that you need to appeal to a whole

1655
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:59,120
bunch of different demographics with different tastes which means you're gonna get yours too

1656
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:08,640
i don't have one this is not fair so basically as you as you increase your uh your install base

1657
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:14,560
for a product that means you have to start appealing to different types of people who

1658
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:18,960
all have different different ideas about what they want to buy which means some sort of

1659
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:24,880
universalization of what you're offering right it has to be it has to be acceptable to 10 different

1660
02:45:24,880 --> 02:45:29,040
types of people all with 10 different sensibilities which which necessarily leads to some sort of

1661
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:34,080
watering down so there's a capitalism has this universalizing effect but communism also has a

1662
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:38,480
universalizing effect and they're kind of like twins in that regard this is something that i

1663
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:44,480
don't fully understand yet i'm still trying to work it out in my head but i think like

1664
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:52,960
there is there is something corrosive to small communities whether they be online communities

1665
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:58,160
or even real life communities like small towns that capitalism brings into the equation that

1666
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:05,280
socialism or communism cannot actually solve it only exacerbates and i don't know what to do about

1667
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:11,280
it i don't quite know how to formulate this idea very vague i will say and also i can tell why some

1668
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:15,840
people might say that you're a subversive communist infiltrating right-wing spaces okay yeah probably

1669
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:22,160
yeah anything else before we let you go so i don't know yeah that kind of ironically what dev said

1670
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:29,920
kind of ironically goes into why i think the left is so bad on palestine right now because they are

1671
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:36,880
identity opportunists rather than being on mission and on mission would mean dismantling structures

1672
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:43,520
of oppression this is yes yeah and somewhat relating to what dev's saying is that okay so

1673
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:50,960
bland market consumer level you know twitch subscriber level socialism doesn't solve it

1674
02:46:50,960 --> 02:47:00,160
because that's all about land back and you know all of the these groups of people are good and

1675
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:06,080
we should support them rather than we need to smash gender hierarchy and that's yeah that's

1676
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:11,120
what being a leftist is well so that'll thank you for being here thank you for your questions and

1677
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:18,080
thank you for the blah i don't know if i'm saying that right let's see let's go i love

1678
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:28,960
i could be mispronouncing his looks so new he's new on the blah train i've been here for years

1679
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:35,680
okay oh god five dollars from artemis dev was picking me weak for caving to online harassment

1680
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:41,040
he wants me to you know i'll just say yes fuck you this is like a meme in my community

1681
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:48,640
i'm not familiar but fair enough don't cave to the harassers gang it only makes them stronger never

1682
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:54,640
apologize um that's not true you should apologize if you do something wrong but there is a the crowd

1683
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:59,360
doesn't want you to say sorry it wants your blood right and it will so here's the thing like yeah

1684
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:06,480
i'm sure i've never experienced anything as bad as you have as you have as you have during gamer

1685
02:48:06,480 --> 02:48:11,680
gabriella but i've been harassed on the internet as well you know yeah if you have if you have a

1686
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:16,400
channel of of any sort of size you get harassed for something somewhere right and the lesson i've

1687
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:22,480
learned is just never back down never apologize if you think you're right and it's a hard lesson

1688
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:27,040
to learn for sure but it's definitely served me well over the years where it's like no i actually

1689
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:30,560
think that i'm correct about this and i don't care if there's a thousand people who want my head

1690
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:36,800
i'm not going to give in i think there's some quality some psychology of you that i haven't

1691
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:45,120
quite figured out yet where you you mention a lot like there's like five or six videos about how you

1692
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:51,520
don't have trolls remorse and i i don't mean to put you on the psychologist couch but i think

1693
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:57,200
there's some part of you where your identity of yourself and the way you perceive yourself

1694
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:03,760
is is based in this kind of the edgy chats you were having back in the 2000s

1695
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:10,960
and i still have don't worry and i i think it affects your analysis of things in a way that

1696
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:18,160
doesn't help you get to the right answers always maybe i i think it's just that you can

1697
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:25,760
you can always it never hurts to have a greater constitution you know sure and that's kind of how

1698
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:30,160
how i viewed i viewed things like that okay let's bring out we got a we got a few more

1699
02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:34,160
now i want to get through on the callers gang i had um i know that i want to respect your time

1700
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:39,200
as well i'm just about done yeah i know so we'll we'll get through the current crop i'll make sure

1701
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:47,440
they are in a timely manner and then we'll close it out oh let's get them in hello you're live you

1702
02:49:47,440 --> 02:49:54,640
got a question or a comment i suppose uh yes can you hear me we can what's up hello this is one of

1703
02:49:54,640 --> 02:50:02,640
my viewers what's up dude uh hello uh i was just wondering do you think uh horseshoe theory is

1704
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:09,200
correct me or brianna brianna uh i'm getting sold on it

1705
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:17,440
uh it's hard to think it's right another one is do you guys think government should break up

1706
02:50:17,440 --> 02:50:26,640
monopolies like intervene i think one of the things that makes america different than china

1707
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:32,080
is if you look at the ascendance of something like bite dance uh you know china and the prc

1708
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:37,200
are just synonymous with bite dance anyone that tells you they're not is just lying to you

1709
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:43,360
outright and i do think that a good thing about this country is america tends to be a little bit

1710
02:50:43,360 --> 02:50:51,280
more laissez faire in picking winners and losers so i i think that i actually really agree with

1711
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:56,400
elizabeth warren that when it comes to some of these really really big companies in the tech

1712
02:50:56,400 --> 02:51:05,200
space though um we're really limiting innovation because no one else can operate in the space they

1713
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:11,040
get either bought up immediately or just crushed or a company like facebook will will just come in

1714
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:17,840
and dominate them by stealing their features so um i think in general i think over my lifetime the

1715
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:23,440
the government has gotten less willing to use their power to break up monopolies but i also

1716
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:30,400
think it needs to be done extremely extremely thoughtfully um because it's not always bad a

1717
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:38,000
really good example is uh in the game industry we've seen a move towards uh the model of things

1718
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:45,120
like game games pass right where uh microsoft or sony will actually own the studio and then will

1719
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:51,520
fund direct development these kind of b-tier games this is good in some ways and it sustains a lot of

1720
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:58,000
smaller development studios that also leads to you know more vertical integration in the game

1721
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:04,560
industry so i i don't think it's like either or i think that it's um i think we need to look at

1722
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:08,080
these situations but i think overall we've not used that power enough

1723
02:52:10,800 --> 02:52:18,160
okay uh did you get your questions answered sir uh i got one more one more quickly uh

1724
02:52:18,880 --> 02:52:26,160
hey dev what's that font you use in your videos uh the old one was called handy sands

1725
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:31,040
but in order for me to start using it legally it was gonna cost you like ten thousand fucking

1726
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:38,240
dollars pieces yeah so i switched over to atma and i use atma bold all right find that you can

1727
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:43,200
find that for free on google fonts thanks all right thank you those are my questions all right

1728
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:50,560
bye go to blambot.com uh i've used them for my professional design work for years uh their

1729
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:57,280
licensing fees are very very reasonable very awesome awesome i guess real quick regarding his

1730
02:52:57,600 --> 02:53:05,440
his horseshoe theory uh question the more i'll be very quick wick i'm sorry no it's not like we

1731
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:11,760
could like look we can we could talk all night if you want i just don't have to go yeah um

1732
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:15,200
basically like the more that i've been reading political theory the more that i've been convinced

1733
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:23,040
by horseshoe theory because i've yeah i keep i keep finding like these 1920s and 1930s socialists

1734
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:27,040
who are writing like fascists and i'm like how did this come about why is there this

1735
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:30,800
link between these two ideologies and the more i read the more that i'm like okay there's like

1736
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:34,400
a pipeline here or something something has to be going on here and it's been like obscured in the

1737
02:53:34,400 --> 02:53:40,560
modern era because nobody reads political theory anymore but something's going on yeah i would uh

1738
02:53:40,560 --> 02:53:49,040
on this i i don't know if policy wise it holds up horseshoe theory but i know behavior wise it

1739
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:55,760
absolutely does um the further you go to the extremes the more willing they are to engage

1740
02:53:55,760 --> 02:54:01,200
in certain types of behaviors that if you go away from those extremes are seen as unacceptable

1741
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:08,720
so in that way i think horseshoe theory is is is a circle honestly um the more extreme fringes

1742
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:15,040
of certain beliefs are willing to any means necessary it no bad tactics just bad targets

1743
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:20,160
and we can see that on both sides and it is a problem it is absolutely it is something that

1744
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:24,720
we need to get away from immediately but yeah that's my thought uh you guys ready for the next

1745
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:31,040
call let's do it real quick real quick artemis foul two dollars ask dev how he lost his license

1746
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:36,240
he wants to reveal all my deep lore okay he's gonna have to if he wants to interrupt and and

1747
02:54:36,240 --> 02:54:42,720
and things like that that's cool we like your money driver's license but uh when i was like 21

1748
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:49,920
i'm i'm not 21 anymore and i can i i'm fine now okay but way back in the day i drove a

1749
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:55,600
dump truck for the city of toronto i worked for the municipality awesome i was driving around

1750
02:54:55,600 --> 02:55:01,840
with the back up because i had dumped a load and i forgot to put the bed down so i was driving down

1751
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:07,200
down the street with with the bed up and i went right through an intersection and took down all

1752
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:14,480
the power lines and the city was without power for for a little while so i was like you know what

1753
02:55:14,480 --> 02:55:19,920
i i lost my license i got demoted i was i was back down to picking up garbage for the city again

1754
02:55:20,640 --> 02:55:25,600
and uh it was a rough time for me for a while so i will tell you a quick story about driving

1755
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:31,920
a dump truck myself so in mississippi there's very very little to do but one of my best friends

1756
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:38,960
growing up uh his uh grandfather had uh basically this pit in the middle of the woods and they were

1757
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:43,920
out there you know chopping down the trees like basically chopping down the forest to make a bunch

1758
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:51,120
of money from it right so uh i actually learned how to pick locks in high school so we could then

1759
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:58,560
open the gate and go into the sand pit and this is the same year that i learned how to make fake ids

1760
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:05,520
so i was the only person in my high school class that could actually get us alcohol and i did so

1761
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:12,560
we would go out there and throw these huge parties in this bonfire pit and a bunch of 16 year olds

1762
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:18,320
getting drunk out of our mind and driving the wrecking ball around driving the dump truck around

1763
02:56:18,320 --> 02:56:26,080
while students are in the back passed out of their mind like going and uh like like cranes bulldozers

1764
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:30,960
all this stuff i actually know how to operate all of that equipment because of the extremely

1765
02:56:30,960 --> 02:56:37,600
illegal stuff i was doing back then all right disavow all illegal activities i wag my finger

1766
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:44,240
okay well is this actually limitations passed on that or yeah yeah okay yeah good because people

1767
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:49,360
will sit on it and try to use it well anyway i've told this story many times president sunday's

1768
02:56:49,360 --> 02:56:58,400
watching you know he might true true um go ahead uh new caller i'm sorry i don't know your name i

1769
02:56:58,400 --> 02:57:05,280
stream things up hi you're live hey yeah it's grayboard oh i know cryborn one of my

1770
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:13,120
community members hello so uh brianna i um i was hoping uh you could you could kind of

1771
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:21,360
remind people what's at stake should republicans win in 2024 and why the uh left wing infighting

1772
02:57:21,360 --> 02:57:28,000
is so so dangerous thank you for such a great question um you know trump is an existential

1773
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:35,120
threat to democracy and uh you know he's certainly going to abuse his power to uh

1774
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:41,440
basically get revenge on his enemies and stop the uh rule of law from being implemented against him

1775
02:57:41,440 --> 02:57:47,280
uh you know he has nothing to lose he's looking at prison time so you know uh trump himself is

1776
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:53,280
this existential threat to democracy additionally you know if you look at the uh fringe rightward

1777
02:57:53,280 --> 02:57:59,120
tilt of the court i think one of the worst things that could happen is trump uh like appointing even

1778
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:07,520
more uh judges uh to the judiciary so it's really not an exaggeration to say if we don't get our

1779
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:14,400
shit together and work on winning 2024 i genuinely am not sure we're still going to have a country

1780
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:20,480
damn actually i have a question for you i have a question for you if you don't mind um

1781
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:27,200
do you think that trump genuinely believes that he won 2020 and he's just wrong about it

1782
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:32,320
or do you think that he knows he lost and he's just been coping i i don't have to surmise about

1783
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:36,960
this because it's all come out in the the cases against him where he's admitted in private

1784
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:43,440
people testified how he knows he lost and uh it was him just trying to keep power so don't take

1785
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:48,640
my word for it take it from the people that were there um if you have those could you send them to

1786
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:54,320
me i'm kind of curious yeah i'm it's very easily found but i will do that after the show

1787
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:59,680
okay great whoa wow thank you getting some information answered well thanks

1794
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:48,240

1795
02:59:48,240 --> 02:59:53,680
reference what i don't i've looked at that so many times i'm like what the hell uh so i started the

1796
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:58,720
channel in 2009 when it was like me and my friends kind of running around my small town with a camera

1797
02:59:58,720 --> 03:00:05,280
and we were shooting um we were shooting anime content and the name just stuck from when i was

1798
03:00:05,280 --> 03:00:11,840
younger it just stuck around so like yeah you know 2009 that was the era of like channel awesome on

1799
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:15,920
the internet right this was long before a lot of the nonsense we're facing now so we were like

1800
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:21,120
we're gonna be anime reviewers and we're gonna make it onto doug walker's website and that was

1801
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:27,760
like our big dream it didn't work out but actually i have like a bit of deep lore on that for for

1802
03:00:27,760 --> 03:00:33,520
anybody who cares about fucking channel awesome lore from 15 years ago um we and after the channel

1803
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:38,560
got bigger we ended up applying again and they took us and then i rejected it because i just

1804
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:46,160
wanted to see that i could oh fightful okay spiteful one victory i have way over thought

1805
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:52,080
this that i've thought for years because you know your voice is yeah you've got like you could be a

1806
03:00:52,080 --> 03:00:57,680
voice actor professional voice actor you're really good at that right um and there's such a disconnect

1807
03:00:57,680 --> 03:01:04,640
between like short fat otaku and your voice so i'm like is this an ironic commentary is this

1808
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:08,560
and i find out it's one of these situations like when you're playing somebody online

1809
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:13,920
and their username is like boobs are awesome and you're like okay they were 14 when they made that

1810
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:19,360
username that's that's basically what it is yeah yeah we got we got two more colors i want to be

1811
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:23,520
real quick with them then we're gonna let blue off the leash here and get get her out of here

1812
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:27,600
um uh but let's bring them on hello friend

1813
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:36,320
why we wait for him 10 more bucks from artemis fowl if the last message about

1814
03:01:36,320 --> 03:01:39,840
trump being an existential threat is as important as you think it is why is trump gaining support

1815
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:45,360
across the board including 20 22 of african americans now we'll answer that question later

1816
03:01:45,360 --> 03:01:53,120
uh but i would say it's simply uh the fact that people are tired they they view the economy as

1817
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:58,480
doing poorly whether or not or not it is that's how they view the economy and i think that's

1818
03:01:58,480 --> 03:02:05,840
just driving things right i agree okay um okay you're here great excellent what's up

1819
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:12,800
you're live hey so first off since people already know i'm in the military so any statements i make

1820
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:17,280
are personal opinions are reflective of department of defense or the army anything like that got to

1821
03:02:17,360 --> 03:02:22,880
do which uh which place should you serve in uh i'm in the army officer thank you very much for that

1822
03:02:23,440 --> 03:02:28,240
no officer though oh well you guys are working i wish we had someone who worked for a living on

1823
03:02:28,240 --> 03:02:37,840
but go ahead okay so i'll ask uh just one short question so i'm a big fan of jonathan height

1824
03:02:37,840 --> 03:02:44,240
rider and elephant kind of stuff yeah so what what do you guys do to actually check

1825
03:02:44,960 --> 03:02:50,480
your policies and social prescriptions that you support to make sure it's not the elephant in

1826
03:02:50,480 --> 03:02:56,640
charge what's the elephant in charge can you help me understand that yeah yeah so okay so the basic

1827
03:02:56,640 --> 03:03:03,600
idea is most people are not as rational as they think they are you're primarily controlled by

1828
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:11,200
instincts and emotion which is kind of like an elephant and then your rational mind is the person

1829
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:15,760
riding on top of the elephant the rider thinks they're in control but the elephant just kind

1830
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:23,760
of does what it does and you post hoc rationalize afterwards um i will answer this question first

1831
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:28,880
if i may um and then i'll let the stars of the show go but one of the things that i personally

1832
03:03:28,880 --> 03:03:34,480
do to make sure that i am checking my biases making sure i'm not just knee-jerking is building

1833
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:40,000
a community like this where most of my community yells at me all the time right where i'm constantly

1834
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:46,800
challenged i am in a space where i have other elephants to check my elephant if that makes sense

1835
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:54,080
right where i am challenged and i have we normalize being able to come to me directly and say wick

1836
03:03:54,080 --> 03:04:00,560
you're being stupid you're being wrong you're being um irrational that's that's what i it's

1837
03:04:00,560 --> 03:04:08,720
not perfect but that's that's my go-to anyway i think for me i mean earlier in the show i talked

1838
03:04:08,720 --> 03:04:14,800
about how reactionary i was during gamergate uh you know speaking of trauma right so i think

1839
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:20,000
that's a really good example of where i failed um i can't think of any situation where i got really

1840
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:26,000
really angry and posted a tweet response to that that it worked out well and i think part of the

1841
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:34,720
good part of getting older is you you learn to uh to don't react that emotionally as often uh i

1842
03:04:34,720 --> 03:04:39,920
clearly fail at this all the time uh you know my passion is just a part of my personality

1843
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:46,000
it's probably never going to go away but i think you try to surround yourself uh with uh people

1844
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:51,600
you that you really value their counsel um something i think that has really been good at

1845
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:57,280
helping me get the right answer dev i think it's clear from this conversation tonight i genuinely

1846
03:04:57,280 --> 03:05:03,360
watch your youtube channel even though i've had many criticisms of parts of that tonight right

1847
03:05:03,360 --> 03:05:08,960
i i do spend a lot of time watching content i don't agree with because i do think it helps me

1848
03:05:08,960 --> 03:05:13,360
make sure that my opinions are correct and yeah there's some stuff you've said that i've changed

1849
03:05:13,360 --> 03:05:19,600
my mind on and i've admitted as much but yeah i think that uh that ability to hear another side

1850
03:05:19,600 --> 03:05:27,040
is really really important i guess without a view it is when it comes to oh thanks by the way i do

1851
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:35,040
appreciate the fluffing um when it's genuine um when it comes to um the elephant and the rider

1852
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:41,440
when jonathan height lays out that example what he's basically saying is that if the elephant is

1853
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:46,080
calm the rider is capable of directing the elephant in the general direction that the

1854
03:05:46,080 --> 03:05:52,240
rider wants to go but if the elephant is agitated the rider has no hope right and the best way you

1855
03:05:52,240 --> 03:05:57,680
can do that is you can make the road as clear as possible so a lot of things that you can do

1856
03:05:57,680 --> 03:06:04,480
to help along your own rationality is to before you get into any sort of heated debate before you

1857
03:06:04,480 --> 03:06:09,920
ever actually have to use those precious cycles of brain power which are quite limited per day

1858
03:06:10,480 --> 03:06:15,200
make sure that like your your environment is set you know make sure that your house is in order

1859
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:19,280
make sure your ideas are in order make sure that you've studied you've read make sure that you

1860
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:25,200
considered other things before you have to be tested on them right that that's probably the

1861
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:30,720
best way that you can avoid you know that that is the best way you can avoid saying something stupid

1862
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:41,040
okay okay fair enough and and before i head off i will recommend to rihanna that you should

1863
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:47,840
absolutely read the righteous mind by jonathan height uh yes so yeah why isn't even this

1864
03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:53,680
righteous mind tell me about this the righteous mind by jonathan height that is basically his

1865
03:06:53,680 --> 03:06:59,040
his magnum opus it's the psychology of morality it's the six moral foundations we talked about

1866
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:04,480
earlier that that is that is the and it is free on audible i'm buying it right now boom

1867
03:07:05,360 --> 03:07:09,440
you won't regret it thank you yeah what if i can ask what do you do in the army

1868
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:14,960
yeah so uh i'm just an infantry officer so i'm not going to go into my specific job but i've done

1869
03:07:14,960 --> 03:07:22,880
things from platoon leader company officership s3 in the shop time so just kind of all different

1870
03:07:22,880 --> 03:07:29,280
kinds of jobs yeah just generally my branch is infantry thank you very much i appreciate

1871
03:07:29,280 --> 03:07:35,760
veterans day tomorrow right i think it is uh i think though i think we're doing free

1872
03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:42,400
applebees or something tomorrow but yeah uh again thanks for calling thanks for coming by and uh

1873
03:07:42,400 --> 03:07:49,840
we'll see you later buddy no thanks for having me on officers i was an enlisted um it's a little

1874
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:55,440
bit of a different world yeah we don't have veterans day here but we have remembrance day

1875
03:07:55,440 --> 03:08:00,480
and it's pretty much the same thing um do americans have the tradition of wearing poppies for it or no

1876
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:07,680
no i've never heard of that no um no pretty much just just uh we put a support the troops sticker

1877
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:12,800
on our car and then send them off for war and then give them no health care fireworks and

1878
03:08:12,800 --> 03:08:20,400
barbecues fireworks yeah but listen if you're if you're ever in canada or or the uk or in australia

1879
03:08:20,400 --> 03:08:24,640
or new zealand there's a tradition where on november 11th which is remembrance day in these

1880
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:30,320
countries everyone wears a poppy on their shirt and you can generally buy a poppy for like 25

1881
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:36,080
cents at any store and all that money goes towards the military oh that's a good idea like like

1882
03:08:36,080 --> 03:08:40,960
veteran stuff yeah uh one last caller i'm sorry there's two and things but one came in a little

1883
03:08:40,960 --> 03:08:52,240
late sorry uh let's get infallible foul infallible foul you're live you're on air what is up i was

1884
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:56,080
wondering about something you guys were talking about a little bit earlier and maybe that's a

1885
03:08:56,080 --> 03:09:01,920
little bit of bias that i have just because i'm not seeing this from a right wing perspective

1886
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:07,520
but when i feel like when people talk about the right and they talk about usually the individual

1887
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:12,080
like this person did this wrong this person did that but i've been hearing a lot especially in

1888
03:09:12,080 --> 03:09:18,000
the spit this space around here is the left has progressives have an anti-Semitic problem

1889
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:23,120
i've been seeing earlier you said horseshoe theory now uh what is it do you think about

1890
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:28,320
having maybe like a little bit more fiscally liberal policies would make somebody more of

1891
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:36,000
a scumbag and have more about far bright extremist opinion in life i don't

1892
03:09:37,920 --> 03:09:40,960
that was apparently like we were talking horseshoe theory

1893
03:09:42,080 --> 03:09:48,240
what do you mean i don't understand what you're saying yeah rephrase sir if you can't oh wick

1894
03:09:48,240 --> 03:09:54,960
you're talking about horseshoe theory you had a title up that said uh the left anti-semitism

1895
03:09:54,960 --> 03:10:01,520
problem that is not willing so when we say the left right um it's not just oh i'm a leftist

1896
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:07,520
because i have i believe in these fiscal policies and things like that the left as a term covers a

1897
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:15,600
broad tent of belief structures and things like that um and this is by design um so that we can

1898
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:21,840
uh coalesce and do this kind of like a cooperative action this community action in order to get

1899
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:26,240
things passed so we'll put aside our differences in order to come together to fight against the

1900
03:10:26,240 --> 03:10:32,480
things that we think are bad and to promote the things that we think are good my whole um thing

1901
03:10:32,480 --> 03:10:39,360
that i have observed of late after october 7th especially is how many people are willing to

1902
03:10:39,360 --> 03:10:46,480
overlook anti-semitism because they believe in the oppressor versus the oppressed kind of dynamic

1903
03:10:46,480 --> 03:10:55,120
going on in the israeli-palestine conflict and they don't just keep their um criticism

1904
03:10:55,120 --> 03:11:02,640
towards the israeli state but they again talk in the most extreme terms and are willing to put up

1905
03:11:02,640 --> 03:11:10,320
with again just dehumanizing jewish individuals um in order to because they hate israel so much

1906
03:11:10,320 --> 03:11:15,360
they're willing to overlook anti-semitism and that's a problem and we need to address that

1907
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:20,960
that's my i i just think there is a lot a large part of the audience that does feel like it was

1908
03:11:20,960 --> 03:11:25,760
kind of generalized and a lot of them were frustrated with you and i think that's that's

1909
03:11:25,760 --> 03:11:32,000
fair to be frustrated but they i'm frustrated with them right back because again i am not saying that

1910
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:39,920
everyone on the left is anti-semitic obviously not but if we we can't pretend that there's none

1911
03:11:39,920 --> 03:11:46,080
and when people bring it up you can't can't get mad at it we have to clean our own house

1912
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:51,360
we have to keep it in order we cannot let the cancer spread we saw what happened to the right

1913
03:11:51,360 --> 03:11:56,000
when the right let its crazies take over and dictate and become the elephant that drove the

1914
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:02,000
rider we cannot let that happen and so we must push back excise and get rid of the people who

1915
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:09,200
are cancer in our party and in our movements and there are many many many that i think are

1916
03:12:10,240 --> 03:12:15,600
mask on amongst us but for a brief moment on october 7th they dropped their mask and we saw

1917
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:22,320
this with um not only online activity with people asking like what do you think decolonization looks

1918
03:12:22,320 --> 03:12:29,280
like and gang next every time i hear could be colonized that that is as a term tainted for me

1919
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:33,760
forever yeah right i will never hear decolonization said in a way that doesn't

1920
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:40,640
make me think oh that's what they mean right that was ugly okay so if i can take a swing at that yeah

1921
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:46,560
i hear what you're saying wick um so when i know if you're a traditional republican that wants

1922
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:54,560
low taxes and you know little government regulation maybe even you have a some questions about uh what

1923
03:12:54,560 --> 03:12:59,680
our school board policy should be and how much we're talking about like same-sex marriage stuff

1924
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:05,600
like that that to me is just bread and butter normie republican stuff uh i don't have any issue

1925
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:11,360
with that i want to beat you at the ballot box i don't agree with you but i think that is democracy

1926
03:13:11,360 --> 03:13:16,560
these are some stats this is according to the university of washington uh so this is from maga

1927
03:13:16,560 --> 03:13:21,120
supporters and the percentage of maga supporters according to the university of washington that

1928
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:29,120
supported trump's election fraud claims was almost 98 the number of maga sports distrust the 2020

1929
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:35,280
presidential election results was 97 the number of maga people that believe voting shouldn't be

1930
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:44,480
easier is over 90 distrust this distrust the 2020 congressional results is almost uh 80 percent so

1931
03:13:44,480 --> 03:13:50,400
over and over and over again i think you're seeing this more on the right it certainly exists on the

1932
03:13:50,400 --> 03:13:56,080
left but there's a strain on the right of fundamentally not believing in democracy not

1933
03:13:56,080 --> 03:14:02,000
believing in the rule of law and seeing the opposition as an enemy in a way that you truly

1934
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:07,440
want to see them destroyed not just beating them at the ballot box but you think they're so evil

1935
03:14:07,440 --> 03:14:13,600
that you just want to like this is why you see the national divorce and talk of the second civil war

1936
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:20,080
from the right so i and what really worries me is i see the same sentiment growing on the left

1937
03:14:20,080 --> 03:14:25,600
part of why i'm taking this blow like professionally in calling it out is i

1938
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:29,760
don't want the left to become a mirror of the right i think that would be a really dark fate

1939
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:36,800
for the country any thoughts on this sfo i know it's uh yeah you're the opposition here but go

1940
03:14:36,800 --> 03:14:44,800
ahead well i mean you're you're characterized him as a right right away now look at that

1941
03:14:44,800 --> 03:14:50,000
i guess that's not what i said that's not what i said no no rick just did yeah because it's

1942
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:56,160
funny but go ahead so here's the thing right like i don't remember what it was but there was

1943
03:14:56,160 --> 03:15:01,760
definitely something that made me feel over 10 years ago what basically you're feeling right

1944
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:08,640
now brianna it's like oh there is actually some some dark evil underneath all of the good rhetoric

1945
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:13,120
of the left and there is actually some serious problems here and i think anyone who ever went

1946
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:17,920
through like that i'm leaving the left or i've been abandoned by the left arc which you hear

1947
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:22,080
like tim pool says that about himself i think she won head might say it about herself maybe yeah

1948
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:26,880
there's been like a bunch of people online who have said that i think a lot of that is it's not

1949
03:15:26,880 --> 03:15:34,960
that the left has has left anyone behind it's a realization that not in terms of policy because

1950
03:15:34,960 --> 03:15:40,560
policy is different from location to location in terms of philosophy the left actually is not

1951
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:46,400
morally superior to the right and when that comes out people are kind of stunned like oh

1952
03:15:46,960 --> 03:15:50,800
oh okay and then then they have to go through like a moment of awakening i think

1953
03:15:52,080 --> 03:16:00,160
so if it's i i don't think i've ever thought we were morally i mean you gotta understand because

1954
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:05,280
of my unique background like when i think about republicans i do think about all the people i

1955
03:16:05,280 --> 03:16:11,360
know back down home in mississippi right they're they're good people they go to church uh they are

1956
03:16:11,360 --> 03:16:18,960
living in society that is still very much bearing the weight this open wound of segregation in the

1957
03:16:18,960 --> 03:16:23,760
civil war has been largely forgotten by the rest of the country i think they are racist in ways

1958
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:32,800
they don't understand i think their policies are wrong and i think we need to um to denounce that

1959
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:38,480
but are they fundamentally evil people and i'm a good person i don't i've never thought that's

1960
03:16:38,480 --> 03:16:44,640
true right like i think people are people and i think the more time you spend like actually going

1961
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:52,800
out and doing politics in the real world you'll see like there's the like i've never talked to

1962
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:58,400
anyone i couldn't find something that i liked something about them right so i i don't know

1963
03:16:58,400 --> 03:17:03,200
i've just never seen it in that moral black and white and i think that's why what's happening to

1964
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:08,080
you right now is happening yeah i've definitely met leftists both online and off who thought that

1965
03:17:08,080 --> 03:17:15,520
they were just superior for their beliefs yeah well that is that is a thing and it does speak

1966
03:17:15,520 --> 03:17:22,240
to horseshoe theory um but like i look i i've been going off on this for a while now on my show i

1967
03:17:22,240 --> 03:17:26,960
know people are probably tired about it but i think it's very very important that we have to

1968
03:17:26,960 --> 03:17:34,080
recognize our own internal issues because if we don't it's going to be a problem and it's hard i

1969
03:17:34,080 --> 03:17:38,720
know it's hard it's hard to recognize that the people you thought were on your side are probably

1970
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:44,720
probably not on your side really um and yeah it's just a struggle we're going to write actually i

1971
03:17:44,720 --> 03:17:49,280
actually want to amend what i said it's not only that they think that they're superior it's a it's

1972
03:17:49,280 --> 03:17:55,200
that even in their superiority if it were real they have no humility about it and that's really

1973
03:17:55,200 --> 03:17:59,920
the killer because sometimes you do just just have a better idea right but you you have to

1974
03:18:00,720 --> 03:18:04,320
you have to be humble in victory and i think that's something the left has a problem with

1975
03:18:05,200 --> 03:18:10,320
yeah i i agree with that i think that's why you see a lot of this rhetoric where like i've been

1976
03:18:10,320 --> 03:18:16,480
called a genocide supporter more times today than i can even count even though i'm very strong

1977
03:18:17,120 --> 03:18:23,520
strongly pro-palestine i've said many times like we need to stop civilian death there right so i

1978
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:30,720
certainly understand that tendency to really moralize things really really quickly so okay

1979
03:18:30,720 --> 03:18:35,840
and fallible owl thank you for calling in any last comment any last words comrade before we

1980
03:18:35,840 --> 03:18:40,640
send you to the void yeah i was just gonna say that i think that a little bit that you have to

1981
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:44,320
think about because i think you they get it you look at it from a moderate perspective and you

1982
03:18:44,320 --> 03:18:51,680
think moderates are the good ones and no bad people from all sides moderate moderation people

1983
03:18:51,680 --> 03:18:57,680
moderation moderates there there's times to be radical and extreme there's time to be moderate

1984
03:18:57,680 --> 03:19:02,560
and you have to be able to recognize which is which um i do think that moderates tend to do

1985
03:19:02,560 --> 03:19:10,080
less harm overall simply by dint of their style of engaging with things but that doesn't mean that

1986
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:17,440
they're right um and i'm not like people call me like a centrist but i'm not i'm solidly well on

1987
03:19:17,440 --> 03:19:22,240
progressive right i'm solidly left-leaning i'm not a hundred percent left-leaning but i'm pretty

1988
03:19:22,240 --> 03:19:30,000
close um i do i do really think that extremism is way worse in moderation though in most cases

1989
03:19:30,880 --> 03:19:34,960
i can set myself a little bit further left but i call out people on the left to do shit that

1990
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:38,800
i don't agree with well then when they're when they're celebrating hamas in the streets i think

1991
03:19:38,800 --> 03:19:45,600
you should call that out brother thank you for coming on foul thanks okay um i know that you

1992
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:52,800
have to go well so i'm going to give you the mic to tell people is it time who you are i mean it's

1993
03:19:52,800 --> 03:19:58,960
9 20 it's a three hour and 20 minute show i mean i'm i'm i'm down for i gotta read a couple more

1994
03:19:58,960 --> 03:20:04,000
super chats here so i'll be on for a little bit longer take your time take your time so here's

1995
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:09,520
the thing just just real quickly i've been taking notes and there's probably too many things to

1996
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:14,640
really go into today because there's like this is how every conversation is right like you have an

1997
03:20:14,640 --> 03:20:18,560
idea but then the conversation moves on and like you could have gone a different way so we should

1998
03:20:18,560 --> 03:20:25,120
probably do this again sometime yeah and and i just just really quickly though i i've noticed

1999
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:31,120
there's like a trend with you and me on twitter where i will dig up something that is like truly

2000
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:36,560
ridiculous on the left and you're like flabbergasted i mean you're like do you know what i'm talking

2001
03:20:36,560 --> 03:20:42,880
about yeah yeah because there's the one time where it's like hey here's an article by some random

2002
03:20:42,880 --> 03:20:47,200
leftist who thinks that we should abolish nuclear families because it would be better for liberation

2003
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:52,400
and then see when i say things like um government should be liberal people should be conservative

2004
03:20:52,960 --> 03:20:58,080
i'm looking at you know the the end result of the march of progress where we're now tearing

2005
03:20:58,080 --> 03:21:02,240
down things that are essential and we're slandering them as conservative and tearing

2006
03:21:02,240 --> 03:21:05,360
things down as essential to like human life and it's like well i don't want to do that you know

2007
03:21:05,360 --> 03:21:09,280
i think that nuclear families are actually good you know it's good for most people to be in a

2008
03:21:09,280 --> 03:21:15,440
nuclear family so that's kind of where i'm coming from yeah no i get it i get it um i mean i watch

2009
03:21:15,440 --> 03:21:21,200
your tick tock tuesday videos they're my favorite but i think you do you don't have to watch those

2010
03:21:21,200 --> 03:21:27,280
they're ridiculous no but you show some stuff that's crazy and it blows my mind genuinely so

2011
03:21:27,280 --> 03:21:35,760
there it is okay um where where could people find you what would you if you could will like pitch

2012
03:21:35,760 --> 03:21:40,400
anything to my audience right now to dev's audience what would it be i get involved with

2013
03:21:40,400 --> 03:21:46,160
the 2024 election i'm doing a ton of work with progressive victory uh we are going to be starting

2014
03:21:46,160 --> 03:21:53,120
an mvp canvassing house with death with destiny very very soon i'm really excited about that

2015
03:21:53,120 --> 03:21:57,920
uh deep canvassing is something we've really learned in the democratic party and this is the

2016
03:21:57,920 --> 03:22:04,080
way it works um if you have people that are kind of embedded in the community and they're constantly

2017
03:22:04,080 --> 03:22:09,600
going out to you know fish fries and knocking on doors and truly getting to know people in the

2018
03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:15,280
community and forming those deep relationships um it doesn't just help you win one election it

2019
03:22:15,280 --> 03:22:20,960
helps you start to turn a whole community around and you know something steven has never gotten

2020
03:22:20,960 --> 03:22:27,360
credit for is his commitment to electoral politics and really making a difference i understand why

2021
03:22:27,360 --> 03:22:34,320
his hot takes uh uh get the most attention but i think underneath that is someone who truly

2022
03:22:34,320 --> 03:22:39,440
loves this country and wants to do his part so uh that's going to be coming up really soon

2023
03:22:39,440 --> 03:22:44,480
uh we're going to have ways for y'all to get uh involved with that so i hope that you will

2024
03:22:44,480 --> 03:22:50,560
this country's worth fighting for well thank you uh brianna for spending some time with us today

2025
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:55,520
and we'll see you next week when we have just one thing and that's looking forward to that

2026
03:22:55,520 --> 03:23:00,400
and maybe uh uh deb may sometime we can play smash brothers or something on your strength

2027
03:23:00,400 --> 03:23:07,680
that'd be a good old time do you play do you play street fighter six uh no no what i'm playing

2028
03:23:07,680 --> 03:23:13,760
project zomboid right now actually that's the big one there we go learn street fighter six my jury's

2029
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:19,440
pretty fierce rihanna rihanna wants to take you to task okay rihanna we're gonna let you go we'll

2030
03:23:19,440 --> 03:23:25,120
see you later bye-bye have a good evening what a great what a great you just kick her out and

2031
03:23:25,120 --> 03:23:30,720
she leave i i i move them off move along all right once they're done okay we do what we do

2032
03:23:30,720 --> 03:23:37,520
we got to keep it snappy okay efficiency okay okay that's okay um so now i have you here just

2033
03:23:37,520 --> 03:23:41,600
i won't keep you very much longer but i do have a question we can stay till the end i mean it's

2034
03:23:41,600 --> 03:23:46,400
super chats to do right yeah yeah super chats to do um but before we get to those i will ask you

2035
03:23:46,400 --> 03:23:57,200
this um how do you think that went um about what i thought like there's uh there was definitely

2036
03:23:57,200 --> 03:24:00,560
some people who were saying who were like messaging me and being like don't talk to

2037
03:24:00,560 --> 03:24:06,640
brianna she's a snake and i'm like you know i can kind of understand that point of view because she

2038
03:24:06,640 --> 03:24:11,120
was crazy 10 years ago but i've also seen her make the rounds for the like past year or so and she's

2039
03:24:11,120 --> 03:24:19,120
been very reasonable i do i i whatever faults she had 10 years ago that created this negative um

2040
03:24:19,120 --> 03:24:24,720
this negative view of her on on some parts of the internet they're they're definitely it's she's not

2041
03:24:24,720 --> 03:24:31,360
who she was and i kind of knew that it was going to be a much more reasonable conversation um and

2042
03:24:31,360 --> 03:24:36,560
it was pretty much what i expected you know no i get you i think that there's this tendency for us

2043
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:43,920
to hang the worst or worst selves onto onto others like their worst selves their worst moments

2044
03:24:43,920 --> 03:24:52,320
and that's all they ever are um i can i can attest that through working with her right i didn't know

2045
03:24:52,320 --> 03:24:55,680
her very much i didn't know her at all i didn't talk to her at all during the gamergate years or

2046
03:24:55,680 --> 03:25:00,320
things like that probably wouldn't have um but she's always been square with me she's always

2047
03:25:00,320 --> 03:25:05,840
treated me fairly and i haven't seen her um do anything duplicitous or backstabby or anything

2048
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:14,080
like that if there were snake times before fair enough but i don't see them now um i will say that

2049
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:21,200
like she's genuine when she wants to just work with others not just because um it's just a good

2050
03:25:21,200 --> 03:25:27,040
thing to do and want to change but like from a pragmatic standpoint it's just it's just better

2051
03:25:27,040 --> 03:25:31,920
to build than to tear down it's better to build bridges like that and i think that um we're

2052
03:25:32,160 --> 03:25:36,480
we're working on it we're bringing her around so we'll smooth out that's a conservative point of

2053
03:25:36,480 --> 03:25:42,960
view wick you're not liberating things you're conserving them you know what my policies that

2054
03:25:42,960 --> 03:25:51,840
i advocate for um much like you're saying right are writ large for the community as a whole when

2055
03:25:51,840 --> 03:25:57,040
it comes to my personal stances and things like that i do believe that we are masters of our own

2056
03:25:57,040 --> 03:26:03,680
destiny and we need to take um accountability and responsibility for what we do and what we

2057
03:26:03,680 --> 03:26:09,040
put into the world and i do think that things are worth conserving i'm not i'm not progress

2058
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:15,120
i'm not i'm not progressive for progress's sake there i want to progress to certain things to

2059
03:26:15,120 --> 03:26:19,680
certain points to certain outcomes and i don't think we need to throw the baby out with the

2060
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:26,560
bath water in order to get there um there's just no need for it to tear down when we can uh reform

2061
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:31,840
and rebuild but i don't know um let's ask these uh super chats real quick because

2062
03:26:31,840 --> 03:26:35,440
artemis fowl has been very generous and i want to make sure that he gets his money

2063
03:26:36,080 --> 03:26:41,680
he has that glowy money and you know what i'm here for it okay i'm here for it um ten dollars

2064
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:47,120
the same side that claimed that supporting israel and jews in israel is anti-semitic but became

2065
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:52,000
amazingly nuanced when it comes to hamas and the palestinians who support the killing of jews

2066
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:57,680
i guess it's not a question so much but yeah it's it's one of those things where

2067
03:26:58,960 --> 03:27:04,240
it's it's so easy to be hypocritical because you can have like 18 million different stances and

2068
03:27:04,240 --> 03:27:09,360
18 million different topics and so whatever ends up serving your politics i think is what a lot of

2069
03:27:09,360 --> 03:27:15,120
extreme people do they will like they'll think they'll they will um you know i i gotta find that

2070
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:20,320
exact jesus christ i think i think my brain's starting to melt let me find it here yeah so

2071
03:27:20,320 --> 03:27:24,800
basically they'll they'll claim racism when it cuts one way and they'll claim liberation when

2072
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:28,480
it cuts the other way you know it's one of those things where it doesn't matter that it doesn't

2073
03:27:28,480 --> 03:27:33,600
make sense what only matters is that you say the two statements far enough apart from each other

2074
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:38,800
that no one notices and this is this is why i'm harping on this and i know people are tired of me

2075
03:27:38,800 --> 03:27:46,160
harping on this but people are seeing this like we see people high profile figures have left very

2076
03:27:46,160 --> 03:27:52,400
leftist chapters the dsa has bleeding membership right from high profile members like there there's

2077
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:58,640
october 7th has created this fissure amongst the left that i don't think we've reckoned with yet

2078
03:27:58,640 --> 03:28:03,120
and not just the left the rights rights the right's currently trying to to decide which

2079
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:07,360
it hates more muslims or jews right and they're going to fight about that for a while but on the

2080
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:14,960
left like we have this uh there there are people who thought we were going for one thing that

2081
03:28:15,760 --> 03:28:22,080
have realized that oh no those memes that the republicans were trying to make you into

2082
03:28:22,080 --> 03:28:27,040
no those are actually that's actually what you actually wanted and uh what and so we have this

2083
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:31,760
kind of uh fight going on right now but we'll get through it we'll get we'll get past it hopefully

2084
03:28:31,760 --> 03:28:36,960
yeah um five more dollars there's nothing more delicious or decadent than to be able to hate with

2085
03:28:36,960 --> 03:28:42,880
a moral conscience that is currently the only thing the left offers i don't think that's true

2086
03:28:42,960 --> 03:28:49,920
but fair enough that's a huxley quote quote it is uh well a bastardized huxley quote he didn't

2087
03:28:49,920 --> 03:28:55,680
talk about the left but fair enough yeah okay is there anything um that you thought we should

2088
03:28:55,680 --> 03:29:01,840
have gotten to that we didn't get to tonight my entire list of things well fair enough fair

2089
03:29:01,840 --> 03:29:06,960
enough maybe like something like was there any like elephants in the room that we didn't tackle

2090
03:29:06,960 --> 03:29:13,600
that you like wick i can't believe you didn't bring up this um no i don't think so i don't

2091
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:18,240
think so i mean a lot of everything was brought up it's just that i probably had more to say on

2092
03:29:18,240 --> 03:29:22,400
a topic but then it kind of moved on it's like oh well that's how it is that's how it is sometimes

2093
03:29:22,960 --> 03:29:29,360
um two dollars from testicle johnson vote vivek 2024 um thank you for the two dollars okay um

2094
03:29:29,360 --> 03:29:35,200
and if there's nothing else though i mean dev looks like a professional smash player that's one

2095
03:29:35,200 --> 03:29:40,880
of them oh there you go two dollars from artemis valley i'm looking at him i do need to get better

2096
03:29:40,880 --> 03:29:44,640
at reading these things i need to figure out like either a time where like in the middle of the

2097
03:29:44,640 --> 03:29:49,440
discussion we can pause i can just read them all or at the end or something but people want to

2098
03:29:49,440 --> 03:29:53,440
people want to get their question into the discussion and so i've been trying to

2099
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:56,960
figure out the best way to integrate it it's a struggle but we'll get through it there's

2100
03:29:56,960 --> 03:30:01,840
definitely like it's good to like have breaks or like minutes where you go to the washroom or

2101
03:30:01,840 --> 03:30:05,360
something and you start checking out the super chats something like that that's pretty normal

2102
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:11,760
i think fair enough okay um well thank you for coming on today is there anything uh you want

2103
03:30:11,760 --> 03:30:18,320
to say before i let you go um i don't think so okay i mean your honor agreed to talk again and

2104
03:30:18,320 --> 03:30:23,600
we can always talk again i just i will absolutely reach out to you and uh have you on again for a

2105
03:30:23,600 --> 03:30:34,000
variety of ideas so i have on my calendar for some reason wick 15 november 15 did you give me

2106
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:41,040
a date for anything if i have i'm gonna have to check my messages i document all the things that

2107
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:46,160
i invite people to so i'll have to look do you have anything going on in the 15th no but the

2108
03:30:46,160 --> 03:30:52,000
16th is when no opinion comes on so okay maybe this is just an aspirational thing that you wanted

2109
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:55,680
to come on the 15th for i don't know what i'm doing oh you know what it might have been

2110
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:59,840
there was that there was that one person on twitter what's their what's their name i don't

2111
03:30:59,840 --> 03:31:04,240
remember yeah but they wanted to talk but then like it kind of like fell apart maybe that's what

2112
03:31:04,240 --> 03:31:09,840
it was um yeah i look if we still want that to happen i know that you're tagging me all the time

2113
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:14,640
to bring people on to fight you it's fun i'm just like no i could still make that one happen that

2114
03:31:14,640 --> 03:31:20,480
one is something that i can make happen i just don't like they on talking to them i don't know

2115
03:31:21,440 --> 03:31:28,160
precisely what the issue is like with carl max i knew what you guys were going to talk about right

2116
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:34,160
um with this one i don't i think she just doesn't like you i i think i think it would be a bog

2117
03:31:34,160 --> 03:31:39,680
standard socialism is better conversation fair enough and i think even as somebody who's not

2118
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:43,840
a debater i think that would i could just like kind of walk through that and just be like yep

2119
03:31:43,840 --> 03:31:48,480
here it is yep yep but yeah i'll uh if you want i'll uh reach out to that and see if they can make

2120
03:31:48,560 --> 03:31:53,440
me happy i know sunday's been desperately trying to get you on from anything but uh

2121
03:31:53,440 --> 03:32:00,720
it's funny to watch you tell him no so yeah i just here i know he's listening i understand

2122
03:32:01,600 --> 03:32:07,920
here here's your your one drop of attention here you go but you know in terms of i think

2123
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:12,000
her name was jaylen or something um i mean like i'm interested in talking to her it's always fun

2124
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:16,960
okay because but i think it wouldn't be a fruitful conversation i think it would be rehashing why

2125
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:21,680
socialism sucks and then coping and then it would be like okay well there we go those can be fun

2126
03:32:21,680 --> 03:32:28,480
and those can be uh look we go through the the the what the the standards the classics if you will

2127
03:32:28,480 --> 03:32:32,800
of debates right like there's certain types of content that will always draw views they're

2128
03:32:32,800 --> 03:32:38,720
evergreen um are women bad in the various forms gets a lot of attention gets a lot of views right

2129
03:32:40,240 --> 03:32:44,080
you know socialism versus capitalism that's another one that gets a lot of attention a lot

2130
03:32:44,080 --> 03:32:49,280
of views so there's these uh these evergreen topics we can always make it work uh people

2131
03:32:49,280 --> 03:32:54,880
are asking are you going to stream are you going to start doing streaming uh no they're they're

2132
03:32:54,880 --> 03:32:58,880
asking me if i'm going to do my gaming stream oh so here's the thing here's the thing whenever i

2133
03:32:58,880 --> 03:33:03,120
fire up fiber politics stream because i'm not i'm not a consistent streamer like like everyone

2134
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:06,720
else in twitch poll i don't i do not do that sort of thing i've thought about it like streaming

2135
03:33:06,720 --> 03:33:12,000
every day for twitch poll but i don't know i don't know if that's that's me right but um

2136
03:33:12,560 --> 03:33:18,560
i do stream once a week like a weekly news show on sunday and whenever i stream that lowest point

2137
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:23,280
i get like 200 viewers highest point i get like a thousand so i can do pretty good for myself as a

2138
03:33:23,280 --> 03:33:30,720
streamer i think very cool when i stream video games i get between like 20 and 50 those are

2139
03:33:30,720 --> 03:33:37,200
wick numbers right there but now it's it's that's great but like the the core viewers love that

2140
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:40,000
shit they love the gaming streams and they're always tuning in and they're

2141
03:33:40,560 --> 03:33:45,200
so the ones who ask me dev where are you are you streaming tonight dev it's always like that core

2142
03:33:45,200 --> 03:33:49,520
audience and they're the ones who want the the smaller like intimate streams and they ask me

2143
03:33:49,520 --> 03:33:54,720
like every night every night what i'm doing probably not tonight guys i think i think this

2144
03:33:54,720 --> 03:33:59,360
ran too late and also i was working on uh i was hoping to get the next video out today it's

2145
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:04,240

basically um i'm doing the archcast tomorrow afternoon so i'll either stream some gaming

2147
