00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Cancel culture is an incredible force right now, and frankly, I don't know how to feel about it.

00:05.440 --> 00:11.040
On the one hand, gamergate was technically cancel culture. A significant part of it was, yes,

00:11.040 --> 00:16.320
a consumer uprising against a group of people that they viewed to be corrupt within an industry.

00:16.320 --> 00:21.760
And parts of gamergate definitely involved targeting people's advertisers, email campaigns,

00:21.760 --> 00:27.280
public outrage, attempts to get people fired. But what makes that any different from any normal

00:27.280 --> 00:32.320
cancelling today, where a celebrity says the wrong thing, where an old tweet is dug up,

00:32.320 --> 00:37.840
where somebody's old blackface photos re-emerge? They're both instances of public outcry.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.560
They both involve attempts to get people's livelihoods shut down. But aside from the fact

00:42.560 --> 00:46.800
that people who were pro-gamergate back in the day believed that they were right,

00:46.800 --> 00:51.280
what's the difference? Because I don't think it can be simply belief that you were correct.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.480
When the left cancels people for comments that they view to be racist, or for publicly supporting

00:56.480 --> 01:01.440
Donald Trump or whatever, those people certainly think that they're right. And yet, there's an

01:01.440 --> 01:09.120
obvious problem there. So what makes one cancelling just and another one unjust? It can't simply be

01:09.120 --> 01:13.680
belief that you're correct. Because everyone at some point believes that they're correct,

01:13.680 --> 01:19.680
even when they're not. And yeah, me most of all. When Karlyn Borisenko, or academic agent,

01:19.680 --> 01:25.040
got cancelled, specifically for their opposition to the radical left, losing jobs in the process,

01:25.600 --> 01:30.720
clearly the left thought it was justifiable. And clearly most reasonable people on the center,

01:30.720 --> 01:34.960
let alone people on the right, understand that it was not. But how is that any different from

01:34.960 --> 01:40.400
the recent cancel Netflix hashtag going around right now over cuties? Yes, there's obviously

01:40.400 --> 01:44.160
differences in content, but we're not talking about the content right now. We're talking about

01:44.160 --> 01:49.280
the behaviours of the people doing the cancelling. You have leftists coming to the defence of Netflix,

01:49.280 --> 01:54.800
decrying cancel culture, while those same leftists actively engage in it against other targets.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.400
At the same time, you've got centrists and rightoids both gleefully laughing about how

02:00.400 --> 02:04.320
they finally have justification to cancel somebody, as if they haven't been decrying

02:04.320 --> 02:11.280
cancel culture all along. Unfortunately, for those who habitually engage in cancel culture,

02:11.280 --> 02:16.320
who actually think that it's good, they purposefully seem to do it one-sidedly.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.160
They understand that they are specifically targeting a certain group, generally those

02:20.160 --> 02:23.600
people who oppose them politically, and they're completely okay with this.

02:23.600 --> 02:30.640
Talcum X, known for cancelling nearly everyone under the sun, refused to cancel Nick Cannon,

02:30.640 --> 02:35.680
regardless of whether or not you actually like Nick Cannon. If the things Nick Cannon said were

02:35.680 --> 02:41.600
said by a white man about the white race, Shaun King would be all over social media talking about

02:41.600 --> 02:48.400
it. But listen to him here. He's 39 years old. That means he's been on this earth for over 14,200

02:48.400 --> 02:55.200
days. I refused to cancel this man's 14,000 days because of something he said in 90 seconds.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.600
Now, when people are taken out of context, that's actually a reasonable position to hold,

02:59.600 --> 03:04.720
but the problem is that this staying of the hand is only given to people who have the right

03:04.720 --> 03:09.440
politics. Destiny is getting fucked by the establishment right now too. I know on some

03:09.440 --> 03:14.000
level it's just internet drama, but he's losing some serious sources of income, all because he

03:14.000 --> 03:18.400
doesn't like rioters burning down property, and he believes that they should be stopped.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.440
Of course, the left no longer considers him a leftist, but he always was, and he still kind

03:23.440 --> 03:27.280
of is. I could keep bringing up examples, but I think you get the point. If I were to do a video

03:27.280 --> 03:32.400
of every single example of people getting cancelled, especially over something as innocuous

03:32.400 --> 03:37.600
as an old tweet or a little bit of speech or something taken out of context, we would be here

03:38.320 --> 03:41.680
all day. But the point is that this is becoming a serious problem,

03:42.320 --> 03:47.360
and everyone recognizes it. On July 7th of 2020, Harper's magazine published

03:47.360 --> 03:52.480
A Letter on Justice and Open Debate. And although I don't agree with everything in this letter,

03:52.480 --> 03:56.640
I think it's important to talk about it. The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength

03:56.640 --> 04:01.200
throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat

04:01.200 --> 04:07.120
to democracy. But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion,

04:07.120 --> 04:11.760
which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting. The democratic inclusion we want

04:11.760 --> 04:17.600
can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.360
I personally don't agree that Donald Trump's actually a threat to democracy. As I've always

04:21.360 --> 04:25.920
said, I am neutral on Trump. He's done some things that I like. He's done some things that I don't

04:25.920 --> 04:30.800
like. If I were an American, I'd probably be voting for him this year, but that's just me.

04:30.800 --> 04:36.160
The rest of this, yes, absolutely. If you've been watching my channel for any length of time,

04:36.160 --> 04:40.560
you've heard this story before, but I can remember when the left used to be all about

04:40.560 --> 04:45.120
freedom of speech. And it was the right wing that would reject open debate because it was offensive

04:45.120 --> 04:49.760
to Christian sensibilities. But there's been a political paradigm shift. The right wing is now

04:49.760 --> 04:54.400
taking up the cause of free speech more than the left. And even academics are recognizing

04:54.400 --> 05:00.400
that leftism is devolving into its own brand of dogma and coercion. This letter was signed by a

05:00.400 --> 05:05.600
whole bunch of public intellectuals, but I think what's most noteworthy is that it was signed by

05:05.600 --> 05:10.800
both Noam Chomsky, the most celebrated leftist thinker of the current era,

05:10.800 --> 05:16.000
alongside Jonathan Haidt, a very well-known conservative. Everybody is recognizing what

05:16.000 --> 05:20.720
public debate is devolving into. But of course, because cancel culture is the weapon of the left

05:20.720 --> 05:26.560
right now, there are at least some of those on the left who have to deny that it's anything bad.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.280
A cacophony of new voices are just making it harder for famous and powerful people

05:31.280 --> 05:36.560
to blather on about all sorts of things without interruption. This is technically true. Again,

05:36.560 --> 05:41.120
think back to Gamergate and the consumer boycott, where you had individuals with more power within

05:41.120 --> 05:45.520
an industry than your common person, all being yelled at by a whole bunch of commoners. And yes,

05:45.520 --> 05:49.360
the framing of the classism in this little passage here definitely make me think that this

05:49.360 --> 05:54.160
is coming at it from the left. Here's Huffington Post's take, called Don't Fall for the Cancel

05:54.160 --> 05:59.840
Culture Scam. Every statement of fact in the Harper letter is either wildly exaggerated or

05:59.840 --> 06:06.160
plainly untrue. More broadly, the controversy over cancel culture is straightforward a moral panic.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.360
While there are indeed real cases of ordinary Americans plucked from obscurity

06:11.360 --> 06:16.720
and harassed into unemployment, members CNN threatening to dox Han asshole solo over making

06:16.720 --> 06:22.720
a fucking gif and posing it on Reddit, this rare, isolated phenomenon is being blown up far beyond

06:22.720 --> 06:29.200
its importance. The panic over cancel culture is, at its core, a reactionary backlash. Conservative

06:29.200 --> 06:33.760
elites, threatened by changing social norms and an accelerating generational handover,

06:33.760 --> 06:37.440
are attempting to amplify their feelings of aggrievement into a national crisis.

06:38.960 --> 06:45.840
This ain't it, chief. I know that the left loves that term reactionary, but you can't simply label

06:45.840 --> 06:52.400
people rejecting the bad things that you do over on the left as reactionary. That ain't how it

06:52.400 --> 07:00.000
works. Sometimes the left is actually evil. Sometimes the right's idea for a given situation

07:00.000 --> 07:05.920
is actually better than the left's. This is not simply populist criticism against the elites.

07:05.920 --> 07:11.200
And it's not just something like Karen's asking to speak to a manager. Calling someone's employer

07:11.200 --> 07:16.320
isn't just criticism. Calling their school isn't just criticism. Getting their websites taken down

07:16.320 --> 07:21.600
isn't just criticism. Contacting their banks, contacting their payment processors, it's not

07:21.600 --> 07:27.600
just criticism. Gathering outside their houses, attacking them in the streets, firing on them

07:27.600 --> 07:33.440
with weapons, this isn't just criticism anymore. And you know what? I completely understand the

07:33.440 --> 07:39.840
left's reply to this. If you say something stupid, or better yet, morally heinous, you should expect

07:39.840 --> 07:44.560
some kind of a community backlash from that. And fair enough, you can't be a fascist in public and

07:44.560 --> 07:49.600
not expect people to call you an idiot. And frankly, same goes for socialists. In other words,

07:50.320 --> 07:54.560
nobody is a victim because they've been told that something they said was inappropriate.

07:54.560 --> 07:59.680
But simultaneously, this is not a reason to tolerate the silencing of every difference of

07:59.680 --> 08:03.440
opinion. Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences of that speech.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.800
But there's also great value in tolerating other people's point of view, mainly because not a

08:08.800 --> 08:14.000
single one of us truly knows the way forward. And anybody who tells you that they do, whether it's

08:14.000 --> 08:18.960
for religious reasons, or political reasons, or whatever, anybody who comes to you and says,

08:18.960 --> 08:25.280
the way is X, progress is X, they're lying to you, they're selling you something, because they

08:25.280 --> 08:30.400
are no greater or lesser than you are. And you may be knowledgeable in one thing, but in return,

08:30.400 --> 08:36.320
you are likely woefully ignorant in a dozen other things. Even worse, you are lying to yourself

08:36.320 --> 08:41.680
about something important in your life right now. We all are. I don't know anything. I'm not the

08:41.680 --> 08:48.320
arbiter of truth or justice or progress. Who am I to judge anybody else? And frankly, every single

08:48.320 --> 08:54.080
time that I've fallen into the trap of judging somebody else, it's always backfired in my face.

08:54.080 --> 08:59.040
In fact, as a general rule, if a personality or a YouTuber or a debater or something that you

08:59.040 --> 09:05.680
follow is able to, off the cuff, pull out the correct answer to any topic they're asked all

09:05.680 --> 09:11.200
the time, instantly, you know what? They're probably bullshitting you. They're probably

09:11.200 --> 09:16.240
bullshitting themselves. They probably don't actually know anything. Or more likely, they're

09:16.240 --> 09:21.440
just operating on faith. Faith in a political ideology that encompasses all possible human

09:21.440 --> 09:26.000
experience, and therefore, they don't need facts, they only need to believe in it. But that's not

09:26.000 --> 09:30.880
real progress. The only way that we all grow and learn is when we listen to those people that the

09:30.880 --> 09:35.680
radicals would excommunicate. Not because we endorse their views, not even because we believe

09:35.680 --> 09:40.160
they're correct about anything that they have to say, but because true diversity is, in fact,

09:40.160 --> 09:45.040
diversity of thought. This is why radical leftists often say things like, diversity of thought is

09:45.040 --> 09:49.920
just whiteness, or merit is whiteness, or whatever else. Because uniformity of thought marches in

09:49.920 --> 09:55.280
lockstep with anti-liberty ideologies. Of course, they want uniformity of thought. They'll never

09:55.280 --> 09:59.680
say it like that, but when they're saying, this is bigoted, that is offensive, that's what they

09:59.680 --> 10:05.440
mean. But no word is inherently offensive. There is always a context in which it becomes acceptable,

10:05.440 --> 10:10.320
funny, or even wise. But cancel culture specifically denies both the nuance and the

10:10.320 --> 10:15.440
impreciseness of human communication. In a situation like Count Dankulous has already shown us the

10:15.440 --> 10:20.400
potential devastation in our future if we allow the natural end result of cancel culture, hate

10:20.400 --> 10:25.280
speech laws, to continue to creep into our legal systems. The blatant disregard of context in

10:25.280 --> 10:31.120
Dankulous' case, yes the judge said context doesn't matter, is the core of cancel culture.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.600
Understanding the context by which an idea is communicated is essential to understanding its

10:35.600 --> 10:39.680
meaning. And if you don't understand the meaning of an idea, how can you judge its moral value?

10:39.680 --> 10:44.480
Tone of voice, body language, even the identity of the person who's speaking, all of these take a

10:44.480 --> 10:49.120
regular piece of text and radically transform it. Frankly, I think this is why text-only mediums are

10:49.120 --> 10:53.520
so difficult to communicate with. And since we're on that subject, I actually think social media is

10:53.600 --> 10:57.680
turning an entire generation of people into sociopaths. Or to be more precise,

10:57.680 --> 11:02.080
it exacerbates pre-existing mental problems if it's used too often. It's certainly done that

11:02.080 --> 11:06.400
to me. I know that I've said things I entirely regret due to this effect. Even things that I

11:06.400 --> 11:11.440
still think may be correct, I know that I've made mistakes in how I say them. But social media also

11:11.440 --> 11:17.440
makes cancel culture very easy to engage in, with trends, hashtags, and the forced shortening of

11:17.440 --> 11:23.920
complex thoughts into a tiny 240 character tweet or a 15 second video clip. Cancel culture existed

11:23.920 --> 11:28.240
before. That was basically what Al Sharpton and the other racecripters were doing back in the 90s.

11:28.240 --> 11:33.280
But the slower speed of legacy media meant that practice was never actually as lucrative as it

11:33.280 --> 11:38.160
is right now. Social media is cancel culture's perfect storm. It transforms people into the

11:38.160 --> 11:43.120
worst versions of themselves. That they may more easily make mistakes and in turn be more

11:43.120 --> 11:47.920
judgmental about other people's mistakes, while simultaneously handing them all of the tools they

11:47.920 --> 11:54.320
need to enact that flawed version of justice. And yes, everybody who engages in cancel culture

11:54.320 --> 12:00.000
is seeking justice. But their idea of justice is fundamentally flawed. Justice requires a reasonable

12:00.000 --> 12:05.360
fair interpretation of people's words and actions. An impartial form where all points of view are

12:05.360 --> 12:10.640
considered. And yes, I know this ideal standard is rarely actually reached, but in our striving

12:10.640 --> 12:15.600
toward it we've made great progress. And none of that progress is found within the justice of the

12:15.600 --> 12:19.280
mob. One of the reasons we probably shouldn't actually be surrendering to the justice of the mob

12:19.280 --> 12:24.000
in fact. The problem with the justice of the mob isn't that it's emotional or finicky or sometimes

12:24.000 --> 12:28.720
even violent, though it is all of those things and those are their own problems. It's that it

12:28.720 --> 12:33.680
fundamentally denies the idea of justice itself. It's built on the foundation of postmodernist

12:33.680 --> 12:38.960
critical theory, of which the recently lampooned critical race theory is a part, and it denies the

12:38.960 --> 12:43.840
truth of a universally shared reality. In other words, while the postmodernists understand that

12:43.840 --> 12:49.360
we are limited, mortal, fallible creatures and our points of view are subjective, which is correct,

12:49.360 --> 12:53.920
they therefore believe that objectivity itself doesn't exist, which is incorrect.

12:53.920 --> 12:59.120
My senses may be fallible. I may not be omnipotent. When I touch the glass of water on my desk,

12:59.120 --> 13:03.840
my brain isn't truly connecting to that glass of water. Instead, the nerve endings in my fingers

13:03.840 --> 13:09.040
trick my brain into thinking so. Yes, that's all true. But even my own subjectivity must be

13:09.040 --> 13:13.200
tapping into something objective. There must be some kind of a reality that we're all engaging

13:13.200 --> 13:18.400
with, because most reasonable people come to a pretty broad consensus of its existence.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.600
But postmodernists don't believe in objective reality. Everything is subjective to them,

13:23.600 --> 13:29.360
and therefore the only reason one thing is chosen over another is due to power. Words don't have any

13:29.360 --> 13:34.720
meanings beyond what the most powerful group can enforce onto everyone else. Concepts are offensive

13:34.720 --> 13:39.680
if the most powerful lobby can make it so. When the shared objective reality is gone,

13:39.680 --> 13:44.640
the common ground that we all share as humans, all human interaction becomes a power game.

13:44.640 --> 13:50.960
No, I'm not off topic. This is what cancel culture is. It's power politics. When a person is

13:50.960 --> 13:55.840
canceled, it's not done because they did something that's actually bad. When they do, that just makes

13:55.840 --> 14:00.480
it easier. They're canceled because those people who truly believe that all human interaction is

14:00.480 --> 14:04.480
simply a power dynamic, where individuals represent their collectives that they appear

14:04.480 --> 14:10.080
to be a part of, where there is no compromise, no peace, no changing of the topic, all space

14:10.080 --> 14:15.360
must be filled, all concepts must be boiled down, everything must be black or white, you're either

14:15.360 --> 14:21.040
with us or against us. In canceling somebody, those people are making a power move. That's all.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.360
Trudeau didn't have his career destroyed by his blackface photos when others have, because those

14:25.440 --> 14:30.800
who play the power game have deemed it so. Black Lives Matter will not be canceled despite the

14:30.800 --> 14:36.080
anti-semitic comments of major people involved within it, or despite their most recent blockadings

14:36.080 --> 14:41.120
of hospitals simply because that hospital is treating a wounded police officer. Netflix is

14:41.120 --> 14:47.120
defended by those who routinely engage in cancel culture because the politics are right. Sometimes

14:47.120 --> 14:51.920
a person's bigotry is considered to be offensive. Other times that bigotry is acceptable. It's all

14:51.920 --> 14:56.400
based on the person who's actually spouting it. Individuals are presumed innocent or guilty based

14:56.400 --> 15:01.520
on their identity, their political affiliation, or their class, but it's never anything based on

15:01.520 --> 15:07.440
truth. Cancel culture runs on a quasi-religious sense of moral purity, probably where the idea

15:07.440 --> 15:13.040
of the purity spiral comes from in fact. However, unlike most religions, cancel culture doesn't seem

15:13.040 --> 15:18.160
to have a pathway to redemption. There's no way for you to cleanse your sins, to absolve yourself

15:18.160 --> 15:22.880
of your blasphemy. You can only hope that the mob forgets about you and leaves you in peace.

15:22.880 --> 15:28.000
I'm not laying this at the feet of anyone specifically. Although the left is known for

15:28.000 --> 15:32.480
wielding this power disproportionately right now, the right wing has also done it in the past when

15:32.480 --> 15:37.920
it served their purposes. Neocons have done it, neolibs have done it, fascists and socialists have

15:37.920 --> 15:43.040
done it. Where the leftists say problematic or reactionary, the rightists say blasphemous or

15:43.040 --> 15:47.680
degenerate. It's all the same thing. The only group that has consistently not done this are

15:47.760 --> 15:52.880
the individualists, the libertarians, the classical liberals, and this is why that I believe that they,

15:52.880 --> 15:57.280
more than the collectivism of the socialists and the fascists, are our best shot at achieving

15:57.280 --> 16:05.040
a better future. I've engaged in cancel culture too. I don't like it. It's an ugly part of myself

16:05.040 --> 16:09.600
that I've tried to get rid of, with some success, though I'm not there yet. But there are dog piles

16:09.600 --> 16:15.760
that I've jumped on that I genuinely regret jumping on. Situations like Pro-Jared's or

16:15.760 --> 16:21.360
Shoe on Heads or Crout and Tease. I'm not saying that I don't have serious criticisms of these

16:21.360 --> 16:27.360
people. I still do. Although, regarding some things, I was right about these people, I was also

16:27.360 --> 16:32.640
quite wrong about others. I regret not keeping my head on straight when making public comments

16:32.640 --> 16:37.840
about them. I regret acting in bad faith even if I felt like I had good reasons for doing so at the

16:37.840 --> 16:42.800
time. And as far as the latter two are concerned, I regret not talking about the situation privately

16:42.800 --> 16:48.320
with both of them before airing my grievances publicly. I hope one day I get to. Because

16:48.320 --> 16:53.520
regardless of my actual legitimate criticisms of these people, I do think that all three of them

16:53.520 --> 16:57.920
are good people who are generally acting in good faith, and none of them deserve the shit that they

16:57.920 --> 17:04.640
got. So, although I know that I'm not a big player in any scene, for what it's worth, I'm sorry.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.640
But that is cancel culture, isn't it? You feel righteous when you're engaging with it.

17:08.640 --> 17:13.040
You feel like it's justified. You feel like you're doing something good, like you're creating

17:13.040 --> 17:18.800
something, but all you're doing is destroying. I think that cancel culture being played out in the

17:18.800 --> 17:23.200
real world is something like what we're seeing with the riots happening right now. Even if

17:23.200 --> 17:27.520
there's a real grievance there, and sometimes there is and sometimes there isn't, but even if

17:27.520 --> 17:33.920
there is, the act of destruction is liberating, it's exhilarating, and it feels more like building

17:33.920 --> 17:39.680
a better world than actually building the better world. It fools you into thinking that you're

17:39.680 --> 17:45.280
doing something good, even if you're not. And I do think the rise of cancel culture is actually

17:45.280 --> 17:50.800
bleeding over into the real world through the protests. I really do. There have been instances

17:50.800 --> 17:55.600
where things were a lot more clear-cut, where it was significantly more obvious that the police

17:55.600 --> 18:00.400
were at fault. Like Eric Garner in, I think, was it 2014 or something? And we did not have the

18:00.400 --> 18:05.280
widespread looting, the indiscriminate street violence, the burning down of buildings,

18:05.280 --> 18:10.160
the killing of people in the streets. We didn't have that then. I'm not saying that what happened

18:10.160 --> 18:16.800
to Eric Garner was good, obviously, but what I am saying is I think social media is an accelerant.

18:16.800 --> 18:22.080
It amplifies the worst tendencies of all of us. To the radicals of any political persuasion,

18:22.640 --> 18:26.800
this is a godsend to them. They just see opportunities to make more radicals,

18:26.800 --> 18:31.360
and they are doing so. Every single day, they're doing so. Left, right, doesn't matter.

18:31.360 --> 18:38.560
But to reasonable people who actually value good faith or being truthful or giving somebody the

18:38.560 --> 18:45.040
benefit of the doubt or, hell, their own mental stability, social media is ruining everything,

18:45.040 --> 18:50.720
man. Maybe it sounds hyperbolic, but I really think it is. I think cancel culture is a symptom

18:51.680 --> 18:57.920
of the attitudes of an entire people who have been basically living online for the past decade,

18:57.920 --> 19:02.960
where everything that you are pro is automatically seen by you in the best possible light,

19:02.960 --> 19:07.520
and everything that you are anti is automatically seen by you in the worst possible light,

19:07.520 --> 19:13.600
simply because of power, where all interaction is a game of trying to catch somebody else in the act,

19:13.600 --> 19:19.600
where all attempts to care about your fellow humans are ridiculed because maybe you're too

19:19.600 --> 19:24.320
sensitive. Maybe you're a fucking loser. Who knows? The actual reason doesn't matter.

19:24.320 --> 19:30.960
As long as you can get a wedge in, have an angle, then it's fine. That is what people have turned

19:30.960 --> 19:36.240
into. And I'm tired of it, man. I'm tired of how it makes me think about things. I'm tired of how

19:36.240 --> 19:40.240
it makes everyone else react to things. And the worst part about it is that if you stop playing

19:40.240 --> 19:45.440
the game, then you are at a fundamental disadvantage against those who still play it.

19:45.440 --> 19:51.760
And a good faith conversation with somebody who truly believes their points that you oppose is

19:51.760 --> 19:56.880
much better than simply talking to a fucking liar. In any case, that's my rant on cancel culture.

19:57.440 --> 20:02.240
Everyone out there, take care of yourselves. To anyone who I might have wronged in the past,

20:02.240 --> 20:08.960
I never actually meant to. I'm sorry. And as always, I will see you guys next time. I love you.
