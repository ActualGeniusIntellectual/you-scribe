1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Cancel culture is an incredible force right now, and frankly, I don't know how to feel about it.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,040
On the one hand, gamergate was technically cancel culture. A significant part of it was, yes,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,320
a consumer uprising against a group of people that they viewed to be corrupt within an industry.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,760
And parts of gamergate definitely involved targeting people's advertisers, email campaigns,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,280
public outrage, attempts to get people fired. But what makes that any different from any normal

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,320
cancelling today, where a celebrity says the wrong thing, where an old tweet is dug up,

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,840
where somebody's old blackface photos re-emerge? They're both instances of public outcry.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,560
They both involve attempts to get people's livelihoods shut down. But aside from the fact

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,800
that people who were pro-gamergate back in the day believed that they were right,

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,280
what's the difference? Because I don't think it can be simply belief that you were correct.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,480
When the left cancels people for comments that they view to be racist, or for publicly supporting

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,440
Donald Trump or whatever, those people certainly think that they're right. And yet, there's an

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,120
obvious problem there. So what makes one cancelling just and another one unjust? It can't simply be

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,680
belief that you're correct. Because everyone at some point believes that they're correct,

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,680
even when they're not. And yeah, me most of all. When Karlyn Borisenko, or academic agent,

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,040
got cancelled, specifically for their opposition to the radical left, losing jobs in the process,

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,720
clearly the left thought it was justifiable. And clearly most reasonable people on the center,

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
let alone people on the right, understand that it was not. But how is that any different from

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,400
the recent cancel Netflix hashtag going around right now over cuties? Yes, there's obviously

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,160
differences in content, but we're not talking about the content right now. We're talking about

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,280
the behaviours of the people doing the cancelling. You have leftists coming to the defence of Netflix,

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,800
decrying cancel culture, while those same leftists actively engage in it against other targets.

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,400
At the same time, you've got centrists and rightoids both gleefully laughing about how

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,320
they finally have justification to cancel somebody, as if they haven't been decrying

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,280
cancel culture all along. Unfortunately, for those who habitually engage in cancel culture,

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,320
who actually think that it's good, they purposefully seem to do it one-sidedly.

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,160
They understand that they are specifically targeting a certain group, generally those

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,600
people who oppose them politically, and they're completely okay with this.

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,640
Talcum X, known for cancelling nearly everyone under the sun, refused to cancel Nick Cannon,

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,680
regardless of whether or not you actually like Nick Cannon. If the things Nick Cannon said were

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,600
said by a white man about the white race, Shaun King would be all over social media talking about

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,400
it. But listen to him here. He's 39 years old. That means he's been on this earth for over 14,200

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,200
days. I refused to cancel this man's 14,000 days because of something he said in 90 seconds.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,600
Now, when people are taken out of context, that's actually a reasonable position to hold,

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,720
but the problem is that this staying of the hand is only given to people who have the right

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,440
politics. Destiny is getting fucked by the establishment right now too. I know on some

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,000
level it's just internet drama, but he's losing some serious sources of income, all because he

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,400
doesn't like rioters burning down property, and he believes that they should be stopped.

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
Of course, the left no longer considers him a leftist, but he always was, and he still kind

40
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
of is. I could keep bringing up examples, but I think you get the point. If I were to do a video

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
of every single example of people getting cancelled, especially over something as innocuous

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,600
as an old tweet or a little bit of speech or something taken out of context, we would be here

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,680
all day. But the point is that this is becoming a serious problem,

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,360
and everyone recognizes it. On July 7th of 2020, Harper's magazine published

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,480
A Letter on Justice and Open Debate. And although I don't agree with everything in this letter,

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,640
I think it's important to talk about it. The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,200
throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,120
to democracy. But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion,

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,760
which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting. The democratic inclusion we want

50
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,600
can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,360
I personally don't agree that Donald Trump's actually a threat to democracy. As I've always

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,920
said, I am neutral on Trump. He's done some things that I like. He's done some things that I don't

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,800
like. If I were an American, I'd probably be voting for him this year, but that's just me.

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,160
The rest of this, yes, absolutely. If you've been watching my channel for any length of time,

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560
you've heard this story before, but I can remember when the left used to be all about

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,120
freedom of speech. And it was the right wing that would reject open debate because it was offensive

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,760
to Christian sensibilities. But there's been a political paradigm shift. The right wing is now

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,400
taking up the cause of free speech more than the left. And even academics are recognizing

59
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,400
that leftism is devolving into its own brand of dogma and coercion. This letter was signed by a

60
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,600
whole bunch of public intellectuals, but I think what's most noteworthy is that it was signed by

61
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,800
both Noam Chomsky, the most celebrated leftist thinker of the current era,

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
alongside Jonathan Haidt, a very well-known conservative. Everybody is recognizing what

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,720
public debate is devolving into. But of course, because cancel culture is the weapon of the left

64
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,560
right now, there are at least some of those on the left who have to deny that it's anything bad.

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,280
A cacophony of new voices are just making it harder for famous and powerful people

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,560
to blather on about all sorts of things without interruption. This is technically true. Again,

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
think back to Gamergate and the consumer boycott, where you had individuals with more power within

68
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,520
an industry than your common person, all being yelled at by a whole bunch of commoners. And yes,

69
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,360
the framing of the classism in this little passage here definitely make me think that this

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
is coming at it from the left. Here's Huffington Post's take, called Don't Fall for the Cancel

71
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,840
Culture Scam. Every statement of fact in the Harper letter is either wildly exaggerated or

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,160
plainly untrue. More broadly, the controversy over cancel culture is straightforward a moral panic.

73
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
While there are indeed real cases of ordinary Americans plucked from obscurity

74
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
and harassed into unemployment, members CNN threatening to dox Han asshole solo over making

75
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,720
a fucking gif and posing it on Reddit, this rare, isolated phenomenon is being blown up far beyond

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,200
its importance. The panic over cancel culture is, at its core, a reactionary backlash. Conservative

77
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,760
elites, threatened by changing social norms and an accelerating generational handover,

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,440
are attempting to amplify their feelings of aggrievement into a national crisis.

79
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,840
This ain't it, chief. I know that the left loves that term reactionary, but you can't simply label

80
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,400
people rejecting the bad things that you do over on the left as reactionary. That ain't how it

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,000
works. Sometimes the left is actually evil. Sometimes the right's idea for a given situation

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,920
is actually better than the left's. This is not simply populist criticism against the elites.

83
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,200
And it's not just something like Karen's asking to speak to a manager. Calling someone's employer

84
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,320
isn't just criticism. Calling their school isn't just criticism. Getting their websites taken down

85
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,600
isn't just criticism. Contacting their banks, contacting their payment processors, it's not

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,600
just criticism. Gathering outside their houses, attacking them in the streets, firing on them

87
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,440
with weapons, this isn't just criticism anymore. And you know what? I completely understand the

88
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,840
left's reply to this. If you say something stupid, or better yet, morally heinous, you should expect

89
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,560
some kind of a community backlash from that. And fair enough, you can't be a fascist in public and

90
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,600
not expect people to call you an idiot. And frankly, same goes for socialists. In other words,

91
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,560
nobody is a victim because they've been told that something they said was inappropriate.

92
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,680
But simultaneously, this is not a reason to tolerate the silencing of every difference of

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
opinion. Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences of that speech.

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,800
But there's also great value in tolerating other people's point of view, mainly because not a

95
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
single one of us truly knows the way forward. And anybody who tells you that they do, whether it's

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,960
for religious reasons, or political reasons, or whatever, anybody who comes to you and says,

97
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,280
the way is X, progress is X, they're lying to you, they're selling you something, because they

98
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,400
are no greater or lesser than you are. And you may be knowledgeable in one thing, but in return,

99
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,320
you are likely woefully ignorant in a dozen other things. Even worse, you are lying to yourself

100
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,680
about something important in your life right now. We all are. I don't know anything. I'm not the

101
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,320
arbiter of truth or justice or progress. Who am I to judge anybody else? And frankly, every single

102
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,080
time that I've fallen into the trap of judging somebody else, it's always backfired in my face.

103
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,040
In fact, as a general rule, if a personality or a YouTuber or a debater or something that you

104
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,680
follow is able to, off the cuff, pull out the correct answer to any topic they're asked all

105
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,200
the time, instantly, you know what? They're probably bullshitting you. They're probably

106
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,240
bullshitting themselves. They probably don't actually know anything. Or more likely, they're

107
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,440
just operating on faith. Faith in a political ideology that encompasses all possible human

108
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,000
experience, and therefore, they don't need facts, they only need to believe in it. But that's not

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,880
real progress. The only way that we all grow and learn is when we listen to those people that the

110
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,680
radicals would excommunicate. Not because we endorse their views, not even because we believe

111
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,160
they're correct about anything that they have to say, but because true diversity is, in fact,

112
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,040
diversity of thought. This is why radical leftists often say things like, diversity of thought is

113
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,920
just whiteness, or merit is whiteness, or whatever else. Because uniformity of thought marches in

114
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,280
lockstep with anti-liberty ideologies. Of course, they want uniformity of thought. They'll never

115
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,680
say it like that, but when they're saying, this is bigoted, that is offensive, that's what they

116
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,440
mean. But no word is inherently offensive. There is always a context in which it becomes acceptable,

117
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,320
funny, or even wise. But cancel culture specifically denies both the nuance and the

118
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,440
impreciseness of human communication. In a situation like Count Dankulous has already shown us the

119
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,400
potential devastation in our future if we allow the natural end result of cancel culture, hate

120
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,280
speech laws, to continue to creep into our legal systems. The blatant disregard of context in

121
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,120
Dankulous' case, yes the judge said context doesn't matter, is the core of cancel culture.

122
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Understanding the context by which an idea is communicated is essential to understanding its

123
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,680
meaning. And if you don't understand the meaning of an idea, how can you judge its moral value?

124
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,480
Tone of voice, body language, even the identity of the person who's speaking, all of these take a

125
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,120
regular piece of text and radically transform it. Frankly, I think this is why text-only mediums are

126
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,520
so difficult to communicate with. And since we're on that subject, I actually think social media is

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
turning an entire generation of people into sociopaths. Or to be more precise,

128
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,080
it exacerbates pre-existing mental problems if it's used too often. It's certainly done that

129
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,400
to me. I know that I've said things I entirely regret due to this effect. Even things that I

130
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,440
still think may be correct, I know that I've made mistakes in how I say them. But social media also

131
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,440
makes cancel culture very easy to engage in, with trends, hashtags, and the forced shortening of

132
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,920
complex thoughts into a tiny 240 character tweet or a 15 second video clip. Cancel culture existed

133
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,240
before. That was basically what Al Sharpton and the other racecripters were doing back in the 90s.

134
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,280
But the slower speed of legacy media meant that practice was never actually as lucrative as it

135
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,160
is right now. Social media is cancel culture's perfect storm. It transforms people into the

136
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,120
worst versions of themselves. That they may more easily make mistakes and in turn be more

137
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,920
judgmental about other people's mistakes, while simultaneously handing them all of the tools they

138
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,320
need to enact that flawed version of justice. And yes, everybody who engages in cancel culture

139
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,000
is seeking justice. But their idea of justice is fundamentally flawed. Justice requires a reasonable

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,360
fair interpretation of people's words and actions. An impartial form where all points of view are

141
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,640
considered. And yes, I know this ideal standard is rarely actually reached, but in our striving

142
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,600
toward it we've made great progress. And none of that progress is found within the justice of the

143
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,280
mob. One of the reasons we probably shouldn't actually be surrendering to the justice of the mob

144
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,000
in fact. The problem with the justice of the mob isn't that it's emotional or finicky or sometimes

145
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,720
even violent, though it is all of those things and those are their own problems. It's that it

146
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,680
fundamentally denies the idea of justice itself. It's built on the foundation of postmodernist

147
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,960
critical theory, of which the recently lampooned critical race theory is a part, and it denies the

148
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,840
truth of a universally shared reality. In other words, while the postmodernists understand that

149
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,360
we are limited, mortal, fallible creatures and our points of view are subjective, which is correct,

150
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,920
they therefore believe that objectivity itself doesn't exist, which is incorrect.

151
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,120
My senses may be fallible. I may not be omnipotent. When I touch the glass of water on my desk,

152
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,840
my brain isn't truly connecting to that glass of water. Instead, the nerve endings in my fingers

153
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,040
trick my brain into thinking so. Yes, that's all true. But even my own subjectivity must be

154
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,200
tapping into something objective. There must be some kind of a reality that we're all engaging

155
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,400
with, because most reasonable people come to a pretty broad consensus of its existence.

156
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,600
But postmodernists don't believe in objective reality. Everything is subjective to them,

157
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,360
and therefore the only reason one thing is chosen over another is due to power. Words don't have any

158
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,720
meanings beyond what the most powerful group can enforce onto everyone else. Concepts are offensive

159
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,680
if the most powerful lobby can make it so. When the shared objective reality is gone,

160
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,640
the common ground that we all share as humans, all human interaction becomes a power game.

161
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,960
No, I'm not off topic. This is what cancel culture is. It's power politics. When a person is

162
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,840
canceled, it's not done because they did something that's actually bad. When they do, that just makes

163
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,480
it easier. They're canceled because those people who truly believe that all human interaction is

164
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
simply a power dynamic, where individuals represent their collectives that they appear

165
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,080
to be a part of, where there is no compromise, no peace, no changing of the topic, all space

166
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,360
must be filled, all concepts must be boiled down, everything must be black or white, you're either

167
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,040
with us or against us. In canceling somebody, those people are making a power move. That's all.

168
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,360
Trudeau didn't have his career destroyed by his blackface photos when others have, because those

169
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,800
who play the power game have deemed it so. Black Lives Matter will not be canceled despite the

170
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,080
anti-semitic comments of major people involved within it, or despite their most recent blockadings

171
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,120
of hospitals simply because that hospital is treating a wounded police officer. Netflix is

172
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,120
defended by those who routinely engage in cancel culture because the politics are right. Sometimes

173
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,920
a person's bigotry is considered to be offensive. Other times that bigotry is acceptable. It's all

174
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,400
based on the person who's actually spouting it. Individuals are presumed innocent or guilty based

175
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,520
on their identity, their political affiliation, or their class, but it's never anything based on

176
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,440
truth. Cancel culture runs on a quasi-religious sense of moral purity, probably where the idea

177
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,040
of the purity spiral comes from in fact. However, unlike most religions, cancel culture doesn't seem

178
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,160
to have a pathway to redemption. There's no way for you to cleanse your sins, to absolve yourself

179
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,880
of your blasphemy. You can only hope that the mob forgets about you and leaves you in peace.

180
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm not laying this at the feet of anyone specifically. Although the left is known for

181
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,480
wielding this power disproportionately right now, the right wing has also done it in the past when

182
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,920
it served their purposes. Neocons have done it, neolibs have done it, fascists and socialists have

183
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,040
done it. Where the leftists say problematic or reactionary, the rightists say blasphemous or

184
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,680
degenerate. It's all the same thing. The only group that has consistently not done this are

185
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,880
the individualists, the libertarians, the classical liberals, and this is why that I believe that they,

186
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,280
more than the collectivism of the socialists and the fascists, are our best shot at achieving

187
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:05,040
a better future. I've engaged in cancel culture too. I don't like it. It's an ugly part of myself

188
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,600
that I've tried to get rid of, with some success, though I'm not there yet. But there are dog piles

189
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,760
that I've jumped on that I genuinely regret jumping on. Situations like Pro-Jared's or

190
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,360
Shoe on Heads or Crout and Tease. I'm not saying that I don't have serious criticisms of these

191
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,360
people. I still do. Although, regarding some things, I was right about these people, I was also

192
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,640
quite wrong about others. I regret not keeping my head on straight when making public comments

193
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,840
about them. I regret acting in bad faith even if I felt like I had good reasons for doing so at the

194
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,800
time. And as far as the latter two are concerned, I regret not talking about the situation privately

195
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,320
with both of them before airing my grievances publicly. I hope one day I get to. Because

196
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,520
regardless of my actual legitimate criticisms of these people, I do think that all three of them

197
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,920
are good people who are generally acting in good faith, and none of them deserve the shit that they

198
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,640
got. So, although I know that I'm not a big player in any scene, for what it's worth, I'm sorry.

199
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,640
But that is cancel culture, isn't it? You feel righteous when you're engaging with it.

200
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,040
You feel like it's justified. You feel like you're doing something good, like you're creating

201
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,800
something, but all you're doing is destroying. I think that cancel culture being played out in the

202
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,200
real world is something like what we're seeing with the riots happening right now. Even if

203
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,520
there's a real grievance there, and sometimes there is and sometimes there isn't, but even if

204
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,920
there is, the act of destruction is liberating, it's exhilarating, and it feels more like building

205
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,680
a better world than actually building the better world. It fools you into thinking that you're

206
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,280
doing something good, even if you're not. And I do think the rise of cancel culture is actually

207
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,800
bleeding over into the real world through the protests. I really do. There have been instances

208
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,600
where things were a lot more clear-cut, where it was significantly more obvious that the police

209
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,400
were at fault. Like Eric Garner in, I think, was it 2014 or something? And we did not have the

210
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,280
widespread looting, the indiscriminate street violence, the burning down of buildings,

211
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,160
the killing of people in the streets. We didn't have that then. I'm not saying that what happened

212
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,800
to Eric Garner was good, obviously, but what I am saying is I think social media is an accelerant.

213
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,080
It amplifies the worst tendencies of all of us. To the radicals of any political persuasion,

214
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,800
this is a godsend to them. They just see opportunities to make more radicals,

215
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,360
and they are doing so. Every single day, they're doing so. Left, right, doesn't matter.

216
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,560
But to reasonable people who actually value good faith or being truthful or giving somebody the

217
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:45,040
benefit of the doubt or, hell, their own mental stability, social media is ruining everything,

218
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,720
man. Maybe it sounds hyperbolic, but I really think it is. I think cancel culture is a symptom

219
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,920
of the attitudes of an entire people who have been basically living online for the past decade,

220
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,960
where everything that you are pro is automatically seen by you in the best possible light,

221
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,520
and everything that you are anti is automatically seen by you in the worst possible light,

222
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,600
simply because of power, where all interaction is a game of trying to catch somebody else in the act,

223
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,600
where all attempts to care about your fellow humans are ridiculed because maybe you're too

224
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,320
sensitive. Maybe you're a fucking loser. Who knows? The actual reason doesn't matter.

225
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,960
As long as you can get a wedge in, have an angle, then it's fine. That is what people have turned

226
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,240
into. And I'm tired of it, man. I'm tired of how it makes me think about things. I'm tired of how

227
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
it makes everyone else react to things. And the worst part about it is that if you stop playing

228
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,440
the game, then you are at a fundamental disadvantage against those who still play it.

229
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,760
And a good faith conversation with somebody who truly believes their points that you oppose is

230
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,880
much better than simply talking to a fucking liar. In any case, that's my rant on cancel culture.

231
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,240
Everyone out there, take care of yourselves. To anyone who I might have wronged in the past,

232
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,960
I never actually meant to. I'm sorry. And as always, I will see you guys next time. I love you.
