0	8920	So, it's just the three of us today, unfortunately. Lilith is AWOL. She's missing. I don't know
8920	13100	if Lilith got stuck back at work. She does work at like a smoothie store, so sometimes
13100	18480	you're just like, fuck, you gotta stay late. Shit happens. Who knows? Unfortunately-
18480	21440	What's a smoothie? The fucking smoothies must be made.
21440	22440	Yeah.
22440	24880	I would like a smoothie actually right now, fuck.
24880	28800	I've never liked smoothies. They're fucking chunky and yucky and whatnot.
28800	30800	Maybe you haven't had a good one. Maybe you haven't had a good one.
30800	33800	Really? You don't like smoothies?
33800	37280	Like chunky. Like what's chunky smoothie? Normally they're smooth.
37280	40280	Yeah, you really gotta like, you really gotta blend that shit, Arch.
40280	45500	In my country, smoothies are only made by like immigrants working at like minimum wage.
45500	49560	They don't really care. Like there's not even milk in there. Like it stopped being milk
49560	56520	a week ago. Now it's just like solidified yogurt with some bits of strawberries in it.
56520	60840	I mean, you're supposed to use a little bit of yogurt, like whatever the fuck it's called,
60840	65520	but like, I think you're smooth. If it's chunky, then they didn't make it right.
65520	69640	Yeah. Also you can just make your own, man. Just get some frozen fruit, get some milk.
69640	70640	A blender?
70640	71640	Yeah, exactly.
71640	74560	If I'm going to do that, I'm just going to eat the fruit.
74560	80080	But a smoothie, you can drink it. It quenches your thirst and fills the tumpee.
80080	84960	Yeah. And it's cold. You can have it on like a warm day. Wait, you're in Norway. There
84960	85960	are no warm days.
86400	89600	Put me down. Thanks. That's a brilliant idea.
89600	90600	Listen.
90600	91600	Minus 30 or something.
91600	92600	Well, wait.
92600	94600	I just minus 30 here too.
94600	97400	Yeah, it's actually very cold today.
97400	98400	Yeah.
98400	102440	My God, I wish I had something cold to drink.
102440	103440	Well-
103440	106440	What are you talking about? Like I go to Dairy Queen in the winter. If I'm driving by, I'm
106440	111820	like, oh, I want a fucking, one of them little chocolate shaky thingies.
111820	119180	In any case, in any case, Lilith isn't here. We are unfortunately on a pretty strict timetable,
119180	125180	so we have to go without her. I'm sure she'll be back next week. Hopefully, maybe.
125180	126180	Maybe doesn't even know.
126180	131580	Before we get started, I do want to point something out. I mentioned last episode, the
131580	138140	whole race baiting thing didn't really happen so much the same way that it happened with
138140	142580	Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power or with Obi-Wan Kenobi hasn't really happened
142580	148740	here so much. I did finally find one instance of the race baiting, and it was, of course,
148740	152620	from marysue.com because why fucking wouldn't it be?
152620	158700	And they say, predictable as always, racists are mad about the new The Last of Us posters
158700	159700	and-
159700	160700	Am I?
160700	165460	Yeah. Wait, are you the people they're talking about here, Arch? So basically, this article
165460	170580	is trying to make the claim that because Joel's daughter was race swap, which we did
170580	177500	talk about last episode, people are angry and the fans are, this is fan backlash, it's
177500	181980	fan entitlement and it's all this other nonsense that we've heard a thousand times before.
181980	187820	However, when you talk about Kenobi or when you talk about the Rings of Power, there's
187820	193180	reasons here that they could have that point of view. They're not very good reasons, but
193180	197260	there's at least reasons. For this though, I haven't seen this at all. It's like they're
197260	202940	trying to manufacture an outrage and like no one is biting. No one's saying anything
202940	204140	about this shit.
204140	208680	I will defend my dislike of Arrondir to the death.
208680	213540	And even you said that Joel's half black daughter didn't actually matter in the end.
213540	217460	Well, no, not because of their skin color. Like I don't hate Arrondir because he's Puerto
217460	220500	Rican. I hate Arrondir because he can't act.
220940	225660	Yeah, his acting is stiff. The thing is, if you get an actor, an actress, and they're
225660	230780	not the correct race of a character that they're representing, you can get away with it sometimes
230780	235260	if their performance is so stellar that, hey, they were the best one for the pick. It just
235260	237300	so happened they had the wrong skin.
237300	241180	It's why I actually really enjoyed Disa. Like she's probably one of the best characters
241180	242700	in the Rings of Power.
242700	247440	That's true. She was. Despite the fact that she wasn't accurate to the lore, she actually
247440	250840	did a stellar performance. And that's honestly all that really matters.
250840	254920	If they glued a fucking beard onto her, I would have no complaints about her.
254920	259840	Now that you've mentioned the dwarves, Naomi and I recently watched The Witcher Blood Origins,
259840	264000	which is awful. I don't know if it's even worth doing a video on, but it's so bad.
264000	266120	Maybe I'll do a video on it.
266120	272800	But like, I did one and it's just, it's my biggest takeaway. Like you could spend a lot
272800	279620	of time critiquing the storyline, the acting, the presentation, the costumes. There really
279620	287360	is no end. But my biggest complaint is that it manages to make mythical fantasy with a
287360	292840	high age elven faction, boring and mundane.
292840	298840	One thing I noticed is that that show didn't do bearded dwarf women either. And I'm like,
298840	304080	hold on a second. Wasn't there a bearded dwarf woman in the main Witcher show? I was
304080	308320	like, what? Why, why didn't you do it in this one? Netflix? What the fuck? But Naomi and
308320	312320	I saw this. We were like, oh, I'm surprised they actually did it because this is the,
312320	316360	this is the kind of thing Hollywood doesn't like to do, even though it would be body positive.
316360	321800	And then they just didn't do it in, in blood origin. So what the fuck? Why?
321800	327280	Was there, Oh God, see for a moment, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, like Dev must be
327280	334760	why there were no dwarves in that show. And then I remembered that all female dwarf character.
334760	341460	She's crazy. She was a dwarf. I fucking hated her so much. She, she put like her dead lover's
341460	346280	ashes into her mace and went around killing people. It's so dumb. Cause the worst part
346280	352400	is like, Oh, you killed my, my, um, lesbian lover. We didn't see this. We haven't been
352400	359080	to like literally the only source we have for this is the clearly insane dwarven. And
359080	364160	this thing too, I didn't even register her as a dwarf because she doesn't look like one.
364160	368760	She looks like a little person. And since that is all she looks like, they have made
368760	376780	no effort to make her look stocky or dwarven in the slightest. And so all I saw was a modern
376780	379800	day little person. It was just Peter Dichlage to me.
379800	385600	What did they call dwarves too? Anyway? Uh, God, okay. Okay. Devil politically correct.
385600	390520	This word for midgets. Yeah. Arches. My mouth is open there. Cause I can't believe our just
390520	396000	being PC. I was like, whoa, that's what is the politically correct term for midgets. Let's
396000	406360	see a height challenged people. Oh Jesus. Yeah. When people, uh, if you must refer to
406360	413560	someone by their condition, uh, dwarf dwarfism and little person or LP are acceptable LP.
413560	422720	Yeah. Oh my God. We'll be a little, cause they're a little personal P and midget is
422720	427240	considered derogatory. So there you go. And we got way the fuck off topic. My point was
427240	432640	just to say, I think we've wandered slightly off topic here. Yeah. Yeah. My point was just
432640	437560	to point out that unlike every other thing that we've seen in, in let's say the past
437560	442800	year, um, this is the one time where the race swapping didn't seem political, didn't seem
442800	447840	to matter, didn't impact anything. And the show is pretty good and yet they're still
447840	453320	trying to make it into a political issue because that's what get clicks. Well, of course. Um,
453320	461560	I actually, I saw an interesting article on this. I don't know if I saved it cause it
461560	467280	was such a pathetic nothing burger. I think, I don't remember where it was, but it wasn't
467280	474440	one of the usual baiting sites, right? Yep. And it was trying so hard to find something
474440	480240	wrong with the last of us and you could tell they were fishing and I'm kind of sitting
480240	487000	here like, why? You're, you're literally just trying to be the contrarian in the room now
487000	491800	and Hey, I know I get accused of this. Like we get accused. It's like you only watch it
491800	499480	cause it's bad. I'd prefer it if Obiwan was good. I wanted Obiwan to be good, but it wasn't.
499480	503440	It's fair. A lot of the comments in the last video have been saying like, why are arch
503440	508120	and Kib so negative? I'm so happy that Lilith gives them the Smackdown every now and then
508120	513560	with some positivity. And I'm like, well guys, a little, it's not here today. It's not going
513560	523720	to happen. I think, I think like, I think all three of us, not so much Lilith, but all
523720	528440	three of us, we were like in nitpicky mode in the last, in the last video trying to find
528440	532760	the flaws. We were just used to it at this point now, but now I'm like, Oh, it might
532760	538520	actually be good. Well, yeah. I mean, how we did it last time is we were actually looking
538520	542680	at it. We were all going into it with a very negative mindset because to be honest, we've
542680	548600	had a string of terrible shows and it's, it's been exhaustive and it really sort of drains
548600	552440	you. It was actually refreshing that the previous episode, cause we even said in the previous
552440	557880	episode that it was actually not that bad. Listen to what we say, but that's my favorite
557880	565280	part. See, I think like of TV that I've seen in the past five years or so, aside from this,
565280	569920	the only thing that's been legitimately good is, uh, the boys is pretty good. Invincible
569920	575840	was pretty good. Star Wars, Andor was pretty good. And this, and like everything else has
575840	581920	just been raw fucking sewage. I was not fond of Andor. I haven't seen it. So I can't count
581920	587000	it. It's, it's not bad. It's actually not bad. I was pleasantly surprised at how, how,
587000	594360	you know, not amazing, but serviceable that it was the best parts of Andor would be so
594360	601180	much better if Andor just wasn't there. That's my primary complaint. Like I would love to
601180	607720	watch a TV show that goes more into depth about the, the, uh, the empire. Like the whole
607720	613480	prison thing was really interesting. How they run a prison, the whole security detail and
613480	618500	all of that shit. That was really interesting. Uh, even Mon Mothma, although she was the
618500	623560	most modern current year of all the characters was all right and had some cool stuff. And
623560	629840	I loved, uh, uh, uh, Peter, Peter Lindquist, the, the, the smuggler guy, you know, the
629840	634800	guy who was starting the resistance. That was cool shit. I just wish Andor wasn't there.
634800	642520	Well, don't worry. He dies later. It's okay. I know that. And that was the reason why I
642520	646040	didn't care. Cause I'm like, I know he can't die. He's the, he's the one person in this
646040	652800	show I know has the hand of God watching over him. He said he just died, didn't he? No,
652800	658360	he dies in the future. Cause this is a prequel. Oh, this is dumb. See, there's only six star
658360	667280	wars movies. You guys, you guys need to program here. Okay. Should we, now that we've spoken
667280	672080	about every other TV show under the sun, do you want to watch the last of us? If you want
672080	675360	to watch the last of us, I actually kind of do. I'm very curious as to how they're going
675360	680600	to handle the next sequence. Oh, what happens next? I don't remember in the game. That doesn't
680600	683600	matter. I guess. You know, yeah, that's not spoil it. Cause arch, you're still ignorant
683600	687560	of all this, right? This is all still new to you. He hasn't played the last of us since
687560	693560	we last talked. I don't think let's, uh, let's roll then. Here we go. I'm pressing play.
693560	698840	Oh, there was no intro sequence this time with like some flashback or something. I'm
698840	706120	sure we'll get to it now. Bangkok 2022. Don't get the parasites into the river parasites
706120	713920	into your hand, man. That's cheating. You're almost supposed to go one there. Now you're
713920	718780	definitely cheating. Well, you put a little pile of rocks there. You think that's still
718780	726600	there after the filming of this, you just go out there and see it, kick it over. Well,
726600	731320	there's I know for a fact, there's an abandoned subway station in Toronto. You can go down,
731320	735240	you can like sneak down there and just see all the shit that various movie crews left
735240	742000	behind because Hollywood goes up there to shoot like subway scenes all the time. Nice.
742000	753360	But that's kind of cool. Yeah, it is. What about the sandwich? Yeah. I was about to say,
753360	758360	what about the rest of the chicken sandwich? It didn't eat. It might've been a few days.
758360	767400	In the wilderness now. Yeah. So we don't know how long it's been. Don't blame me for something
767400	774080	that isn't my fault. Wow. You are the least lovable forehead I've ever met. You can still
774080	779560	land a plane there though. How did you guys like the thumbnail for the last video? I loved
779560	786600	it. It could have like, you could have enhanced the forehead a little further. I only barely
786640	794000	enhanced it. I could, it was how, how little I needed to do was okay. Like I want you to set
794000	800960	like a plane on it next time that's landed. Like as a man who has a sizable forehead himself,
800960	806680	that thing is enormous. He's like, yeah, I can feel this power from here. People are the real
806680	812280	monsters, sir. Wouldn't you not want to know if that was the case? Kibs, they changed something.
812280	820440	I knew about this. Oh, they're driving weren't they? No, Bill and Frank. One of them was supposed
820440	827520	to be dead, but that he's alive in this one. So we're going to see both of them. Oh, okay. No,
827520	835120	I missed two. It happens more often than you think. Did you suck at shooting or like in general? Damn.
835120	844600	Okay. That's kind of cute. I got to grab some stuff. I stashed. Why do you have stuff fast here?
844600	850320	You ask a lot of goddamn questions. So he doesn't have to carry it the next time. He hasn't been out
850320	859640	here in a year though. It might not be here. Entirely possible scavengers came by, but how
859640	863640	many scavengers are there and how many scavengers are going to check out a random store? I'm
863680	877640	presumably she hid it. Mortal Kombat 2. These lines would be better if it wasn't delivered by
877640	884840	her. Like I cannot help, but she's just not the right character for this. I actually don't mind
884840	891960	the snark between them. Oh no, I like the snark. I just don't like her delivery of it. Because the
891960	898920	snark is definitely the thing that really did make the interactions of the video game. Made them
898920	909240	endearing. Now I'd be scared personally. Don't fall in. Yeah, don't check with your flashlight
909240	918440	down there first or anything. Oh, thank you. I expect something. Yeah, I wouldn't do that. I'm
918440	926000	sorry. I'm a fucking pussy. I ain't going down for a minute. This is all new, isn't it? Where's
926000	934840	the jump scare? I'm expecting it. It's too tense. It's gonna be here. Ah, she will reach for it.
934840	942600	Don't do this to me, Cho. I don't like jump scares. It's gonna happen, Kibbs.
942600	951240	There it is. It wasn't gonna be a jump scare? They were actually gonna be building like...
951240	959800	Oh, he's sad. He's like, help, I'm stuck. Oh no. Now I'm surprised that he's not dead,
959800	965000	because these aren't like zombies, you know? They're not dead that have been reanimated.
965000	970680	They're still living things. Surely being crushed for this long would kill you. It might have
970680	976040	happened recently. I mean, it had to have, because he hasn't fully turned, his eyes aren't fully
976040	981160	covered. I just want to see you like start picking pieces of the mushroom off her. Jesus, what are you
981160	988200	doing? That's pretty gross. Now, don't be a fucking monster. Like, just put them down.
991240	995800	Yeah, actually, I don't mind that, because she's curious. Like, okay, what's actually inside of
995800	1001320	you, etc. It's like, wow, I let my hyper important cargo that I killed my fucking girlfriend for just
1001320	1009320	kind of wander away. I mean, to his knowledge, she was only in that other room. No, you think
1009320	1014120	he would have reacted to the clank sound, or the dragging sound, or the thumping sound.
1025560	1030920	That gun's way too big for her. This is kind of stupid, though. Unless he's coming back for that
1030920	1036280	thing fairly soon, that's not going to be fireable by the time he gets back. Yep, his plan is to
1036280	1041480	return. That plane is remarkably intact, considering what happened to it. And how it landed, too.
1043640	1047800	Pilot didn't do too bad. There probably was survivors. So, the tainted food all hits the
1047800	1053640	store shelves around the same time Thursday. People bought it, ate some Thursday night or
1053640	1062120	Friday morning. The day goes on. They started to get sick. Afternoon, evening, they got worse.
1062680	1068440	I think this is all new. Then they started biting. Yeah, this is not a very good explanation,
1068440	1073800	because food goes through a whole fucking hell of a lot of sterilization procedures and shit.
1073800	1080840	Like, you wouldn't just get fungus in there on a national scale. Not only national, because of
1080840	1084360	different plants around the world, but it would only be a local area that would be actually
1084360	1091480	affected. And it would be soon. Flower Made in America isn't really flown to, like, everywhere.
1091800	1098280	This would have to hit, like, every single source of a food supply and then be distributed across
1098280	1104760	the globe. At the same time. Yeah, I know. Like, some grain reaches certain bakeries before other
1104760	1110280	bakeries. They bake the food a day or a few days earlier. Hey, listen, this show turns out to be
1110280	1117400	pretty basic. It's anti-globalist, anti-supply chain. Anti-government, too. Again, the only
1117400	1122920	real complaint I have about this show so far is the whole change to the mushrooms is just a bad
1122920	1146200	change. This is another thing, too. I don't know if this was in the game, but I don't think that
1146200	1152760	would happen because it's going to be very difficult to get soldiers to cold-heartedly
1152760	1158440	gun down civilians because there wasn't room at the fucking hospital. Yes, getting a soldier to
1158440	1164040	start gunning down civilians, especially these civilians are fellow countrymen, is not easy.
1164040	1173880	Some people easily will do it. It's like your families. Here's the flashback. Yeah.
1173960	1181960	The thing is, that's the thing. Soldiers aren't mindless fucking
1181960	1185560	trolls. This is Hollywood we're talking about here, aren't you?
1188200	1194600	Hollywood is kind of anti-army, usually. Hollywood thinks that the military and the
1194600	1200200	police are just these crypto-fascists waiting for orders from whoever happens to hold the
1200200	1211880	reins of power. And they'll gun down whoever the fuck... Oh, yeah, so Bill and Frank,
1211880	1224280	they were like the libertarians, eh? Yeah. Yeah, Bill... I think it was Bill who was the
1224280	1228920	hardcore libertarian who was just like, I've been waiting for so fucking long for the world
1228920	1234440	to collapse so I can live out here in peace. But he didn't live in a forest, he lived in a suburb.
1235560	1238360	He's a base man. What a bossin.
1240600	1245960	He's a collector. That's a selection. Yep. I like he's got Waterloo, the great weasel of lies down
1245960	1252040	there. Oh my god, look, he put on a gas mask. How hard was it for him? Now that's an actor I
1252040	1258280	respect already. Look at that. I think I know who this guy is, so I get recognized his voice.
1258280	1261160	In fact, he's willing to wear a gas mask. This fucking guy.
1263560	1267560	I don't think I would have chosen the shotgun to go out hunting the feds, but... Basically,
1267560	1273320	the feds came through, evacuated everyone, and if you couldn't go, they killed you. He smiled. Oh,
1273320	1279960	it is? It's the fucking guy from... Oh god, what's that show? Oh fuck, I can't remember.
1281880	1286440	I'm actually glad they picked him, though. He's gonna go fishing.
1288360	1290760	Might as well. Might as well.
1293880	1298920	This must be heaven for him. I mean, the power's still on, so you might as well...
1298920	1304520	Yep, it's gonna be off soon. Yeah. That was fast. That was fast,
1304520	1310200	unironically. Only lasted a day. All my commenters were saying that the feds couldn't shut off their
1310200	1314920	gas stoves. Yes, they fucking could. He had to turn it back on. I like this scene a lot.
1315640	1320920	The doomsday prepper gets what he wants. Yep. There's gonna be some traps.
1321880	1325400	I actually really appreciate these flashback scenes when it's like this.
1326360	1328440	Showing us the characters before. I didn't appreciate the previous ones,
1328440	1331640	but this one's nice. The previous one was bad, but this one... He's growing veggies.
1332280	1339160	He's got chickens. Yeah, man. He's gonna be living a good life. Yeah. I want to point out that
1339160	1344280	everyone that's in the federal camps are starving to death right now, or having food shortages.
1345800	1350840	This guy's living the time of his life. It's gonna get a little lonely, though.
1350840	1355720	No, he turned back on the electricity, or is that the generator? What did he do at the gas plant?
1356440	1362600	He turned back on the natural gas to the city. You would have thought that this guy like this
1362600	1367080	would have an independent gas supply, like, you know, the gas canisters in the stove.
1367080	1369400	But here comes a zombie.
1381320	1387960	The show is growing on me more. Oh, he's like turned the suburb into a...
1389880	1394680	He's like built a gate and all this shit. Damn. Yep. Don't tread on me.
1394680	1398200	Oh, my God. I think he has a Windows XP computer.
1401000	1404120	Looks like it. Well, if you don't want your shit to crash.
1404920	1411320	I mean, I just like the attention to detail. That's great. Baltimore QZ. It's gone.
1414840	1417400	Damn. You're hurt. How did he fall into the hole?
1418600	1422360	He was down. He camouflaged it with a fucking chicken net. That thing would be hard to see.
1423160	1425800	He's how the hell did he get one of the federal scanners?
1428200	1429880	He probably just killed some of them while they were out.
1431480	1433000	They might have left him in some areas.
1433000	1436840	And every bum you talk to about it is going to show up here looking for a free lunch.
1437640	1439160	And this is not an Arby's.
1441640	1442840	Free lunch was a restaurant.
1443800	1448120	I mean, after four years, the isolation is bound to be getting at him.
1448120	1452920	Yeah. In fact, I'm kind of shocked that he hasn't gone literally insane yet.
1454360	1458280	I just noticed that this guy is Ron Swanson. Jesus.
1458280	1462280	Yes. That's why I'm so glad they got him. He played Ron Swanson.
1462280	1463640	It's like the same character.
1464520	1467720	Yep. This is a stellar pick, by the way.
1468440	1470920	Well, I wish you were hot blonde, but I guess you'll have to do.
1478120	1482440	What? What just happened?
1484120	1486600	I'm just looking around and he's suspicious.
1489000	1489960	He's so happy.
1491720	1495320	It's like, yeah, that is the correct response, though,
1495320	1498440	considering what he's probably been so used to is.
1499400	1499960	You're welcome.
1499960	1509000	Oh, this is a heartwarming scene, you know.
1510440	1513080	It is so I guess I'll be going on.
1513080	1513580	This is you.
1516600	1517960	He's reading them like a book.
1518680	1520600	Yeah. Oh, my God.
1521400	1522200	It's my favorite.
1526360	1527960	He's like, I'm a musician. I'm valuable.
1530680	1531720	I can raise morale.
1537400	1539400	It's been a little bit. Give me a break.
1542680	1545480	Oh, sure. How long since that piano was?
1553800	1555080	Oh, no, they're going to get tangled.
1556280	1557560	So he's going to be alive now.
1557560	1563480	Yeah, because in the original game, he was dead.
1564920	1570200	And that's why it was super abrasive, if I'm right, or was it drunk?
1570200	1574600	I can't remember something like a weird or about him because he was gone.
1574600	1577480	So, wait, Arch, how how did your gaydar go off on this?
1579160	1580440	Quite a while ago, honestly.
1580440	1582040	No, it's it's obvious.
1582040	1588120	Even if you don't know, this was charged for quite a while now.
1589080	1590360	So it wasn't spoiled for you?
1592040	1595960	No, because for me, it's like I was sitting there thinking like,
1595960	1597400	this is probably going to be the gay scene.
1598440	1602680	See? Well, this isn't anything new because this is how it was in the original game.
1602680	1605080	So it's not always a thing.
1605080	1610040	But this is more like an origin story to how I will say it was a little bit forced.
1610040	1613800	Like this was I don't know, like I didn't mind this.
1613800	1615640	This is actually decent because they're in the apocalypse.
1615640	1617240	Like the guy's been lonely for four years.
1617240	1619560	They're they're both nervous.
1622040	1629320	But this guy, the guy on the bed, he comes across as a little bit too seductory.
1629960	1630840	You have the other guy.
1631720	1633000	The other guy's doing a better job.
1633560	1636680	It doesn't like actually, I think this guy is doing a better job because he's.
1636680	1638120	I like him a lot as an actor.
1639080	1640520	Because they're the guy on the bed.
1640520	1643960	He comes across as way too suave for this.
1643960	1647080	Like, wait, no, I don't want a sex scene, though.
1647080	1648600	Like the romance is fine.
1648600	1650040	No, Kim's got to watch it.
1650840	1655720	No, it feels a pinch forced.
1655720	1661240	I feel like instead of a scene, this should be their relationship after a week
1661240	1662520	or a month or two.
1662520	1664280	But I guess time constraints.
1664280	1670360	So, man, see, I like everything except for like, I don't like I don't need to watch.
1675400	1676920	I have sex for lunches.
1679000	1680360	That's fair, even great ones.
1683800	1685160	Come on, that was at least a dinner.
1685560	1688760	It's a bit cheap.
1689640	1694760	I didn't really pick up on anything gay until the piano.
1695880	1697880	Even though I knew that they were gay because the game.
1697880	1703240	But like, still, I had pent up on the gay around the shower scene.
1704280	1710840	Oh, the shower scene, the shower scene, because he acted very giddy, like nervous around it.
1711560	1713800	Like he was in the shower.
1713800	1715880	He was like, Oh, my God, you're in the shower.
1715880	1720680	Yeah, oh, come on.
1721880	1723720	Hey, would you stop?
1723720	1724440	I like that.
1724440	1726600	It wasn't actually just a sex scene noise.
1727240	1732440	You live in a psycho bunker where 9-11 was an inside job and the government are all Nazis.
1732440	1734440	The government are all Nazis.
1740120	1741960	OK, hold on a second.
1742520	1743960	I'll pause there for a second.
1743960	1744840	I need to tweet.
1745880	1746840	That's brilliant.
1746840	1747400	I love it.
1750760	1753080	Oh, man, this might be my favorite episode yet.
1753080	1755800	Yeah, this is pretty good.
1755800	1757240	You know, it's actually kind of refreshing.
1757240	1757960	And you know what?
1757960	1761240	For an HBO show, I was worried they were going to go the gross path where it's like,
1761560	1762120	pep.
1762120	1765960	And I was like, oh, but they actually just like they cut to black.
1765960	1767640	They cut or they did not cut back.
1767640	1769960	They cut the screen before anything started.
1770600	1773800	And that's good, because the important part about the show is you to tell the story
1773800	1776920	and narrative elements and the relationships between the two characters.
1776920	1779400	You don't need to focus on the non-essentials.
1779400	1781320	The flat flaps the groups.
1782680	1785400	You have it, kids, you're out here getting your cheeks plapped all the time.
1786280	1787480	Listen, that's for money.
1788520	1790360	That's a different again.
1790360	1796040	this it was a little bit too obvious in my opinion because the other guy came across as overtly
1796040	1802360	sexual quite early on and he he comes across as way too much of a seductress i don't see it at all
1802360	1807880	i mean it's just me i like bill zach what the fuck's his name he's he's fucking stellar i i
1807880	1814120	think it's absolutely hilarious how bill does the whole 9 11 truth of the government are all nazis
1814840	1819320	and it turns out he was right but there's like a weird left right overlap here
1819960	1824680	where you have like the libertarians who sometimes say the exact same thing as the socialists
1824680	1829880	about government well in this universe the the government basically was too
1831320	1835560	too super controlling didn't relinquish power are you are you pissing there kibbs jesus
1836120	1840760	oh sorry i was pouring myself some tea oh okay listen your mic's all fixed now your mic's fixed
1840760	1845400	we can hear that at this point oh damn that picked that up yeah i was pouring myself some more tea
1845400	1848200	i wasn't peeing into the cup i swear
1850840	1856120	but uh yeah i actually think that's pretty cool also they chose the best actor to play bill
1856120	1861240	yeah they did they should have done like he meets him he picks him up and they kind of like okay
1861240	1866280	you can say you can stay the night and then like three days later then you do the piano scene or
1866280	1872040	something yeah i would have liked this to be a little bit less starstruck romance but i'm gayer
1872040	1878040	than you fixing up some of the shops yes bill is the more masculine ones are we hosting formal
1878040	1888920	garden parties now no there might be but we are gonna have friends excuse me he wants to build a
1888920	1894120	town yep he wants to build the community i've actually been talking to a nice woman on the radio
1894120	1899400	you what that's not gonna be fucking happy
1901240	1906280	right this is that that is actually extraordinarily stupid okay we have all of these resources here
1906280	1911720	uh would you like to uh come on over and sample some of them i'm the same way this is how they
1911720	1917960	met i'm not schizophrenic he's gonna pull out the gun he has under the table which i get by the way
1918840	1922680	how nice this is to have a civilized meal in such a beautiful place
1923480	1928680	he doesn't oh that's disappointing i mean that's way more fun we don't end up working together
1929720	1932520	they made both of them look a lot younger working together
1933560	1936920	the actors and actresses i mean like they are younger in the in the story but like
1936920	1942680	they really de-age them nicely with makeup or age them up with makeup in the present whatever
1942680	1948200	i want to show you something not inside frank frank
1951400	1952920	bill's mad yep
1959560	1967320	i understand i still want him to be holding a gun under the table he'll come at night quiet and armed
1967320	1973880	that is true i mean this place screams easy pickings
1976600	1980360	yeah you need more people here you need a little town not just the two of you
1982520	1989000	more manpower would be useful for defense yeah those traps in that fence is not going
1989000	1996440	to be an obstacle to people with tools well organized hungry looking for resources
1997320	2005160	um well they put a bunch of fucking cars he's fortified a bit like i can't
2005880	2012920	just one more loop around i got something to show you huh not that
2013800	2016520	oh
2020360	2021160	he got excited
2023800	2030520	it's radishes it looks like strawberries
2030520	2035160	a little one a little one
2041560	2044840	i expected it to be more pissed about that and yeah they were strawberries you thought
2044840	2050840	they were radishes it's close to these strawberry bushes yummy strawberry they're very tiny
2050840	2056360	strawberry not natural strawberries by the way those are modern day bio-engineered berries yeah
2057160	2063320	chunky at my uh girlfriend's childhood home they have strawberry bushes in the back and
2063320	2070280	they're much bigger bushes with much smaller berries yes those are modern day strawberries
2072680	2076040	this episode has actually been pretty good at building these two characters up yep
2076040	2084600	so
2084600	2088840	yeah no this is actually probably the single best gay romance i think i've ever seen
2088840	2089800	i'm quite enjoying this
2091880	2098200	a rain catcher uh-oh stormy night that means shit's about to go down boys prepare for some
2098200	2108920	tragedy they're ready okay that's more than a little stereotypical but
2113080	2121240	flame throwers yes i was about to say like holy fuck hey you gotta wake up dude it's time
2121240	2124280	oh shit
2141240	2145400	he's just taking him out yep bill's already out there
2146120	2154440	he's going to help yep the woman has armed herself with a ppk and it's going to come help
2162920	2164200	dude just stay in the house
2166680	2168760	he's just in the middle of the fucking street
2175480	2180680	get inside he's gonna yeah i was about to say he's gonna get him killed
2182520	2188520	we gotta get you inside no no to be fair it was bloody retarded for him to stand in the
2188520	2196120	middle of the street fucking illuminated by the fire okay i think it's time for the bandits to
2196120	2204680	call it quits that's a lot of casualties yep he'll take care of you
2205400	2214680	you lied to me dev i lied to you
2219320	2220520	he died
2224440	2225720	oh definitely looks like he died
2229000	2232120	yeah there's no way because bill's the one that survives out of the two in the game
2232920	2240040	oh thank god there's no wheelchair now oh damn they're a little old oh no the other one's in a
2240040	2246760	wheelchair okay oh no uh so you just kind of skipped over the whole recovery period he's just
2246760	2251400	he's he's fine now bill's the one recovered the other guys in the wheelchair dead not good
2251400	2263400	i mean 10 years you can recover in 10 years yeah but i i would have liked to seen it rather than
2263400	2267400	just like yeah he was fine damn they did a better job of aging these guys up than the obi-wan show
2267400	2274840	did aging anakin down yeah did you see that somebody used a snapchat filter and did a better
2274920	2281240	job yeah that was sad so he must be ill or something
2285240	2287160	yeah that looks like some sort of
2289320	2292840	what is it where joe biden can't draw a clock what's that called again
2294120	2301000	he's having a hard time eating yeah yeah i i don't necessarily think this is illness i think this is
2301000	2304520	old because that's a pretty good painting everything is it i know he's a prepper but
2304520	2309640	he should have spent the past 20 years building a little town rather than just living like this you
2309640	2315960	know if they had a community that would probably would have made them stronger in the end but yeah
2316600	2324280	yep now they're gonna die alone sad and childless i should have taken a little child orphan that
2324280	2329880	wandered by the fence that didn't blow up yeah that didn't get the shotgun or something like
2329880	2336600	oh look this one's alive i want to keep it i want to keep a little suicide on top at all just to
2336600	2341960	make it extra sad what if what if someone he shows up there wasn't anything to cure this before the
2341960	2347720	world fell apart oh this is cancer oh he's terminal you'll wear what i ask
2351560	2357240	who will get married it's time for drag queen story hour you cook a delicious dinner
2360520	2363880	and then i'm going to take all of these
2366360	2371880	he pranted flowers
2379400	2385560	where did they get the paint from they could probably make it also entirely popularly it
2385560	2390760	was dried paint and all they do is moisturize it home depot traded for it anything
2393480	2397400	in the eyes of god you're still degenerates
2399640	2405800	damn it's true though yeah it's true though i mean marriage is more of a christian thing anyways
2406760	2417160	i know filthy christian i'm a heathen i am when it suits me fair enough rabbits like their first
2417160	2425720	meeting i guess nice touch a lot of this is unique to the show they didn't go into nearly
2425720	2430840	as much detail yeah now the problem with crushing pills and your alcohol is that it's gonna taste
2430840	2437480	like ass afterwards yeah that's why you should just be a man and gulp them down immediately
2439480	2442440	well now they're gonna do it here comes the meal first
2443960	2449720	okay i gotta point out they've still got a wine left after like 20 30 years he must have had
2449720	2456920	quite the fucking stock well also the wine store remember yeah true but even a wine store there's
2456920	2461960	yeah true but even a wine store there's a limit to how much wine is in that store
2461960	2465880	i don't think they're drinking wine every day probably only special occasions you know
2465880	2472280	savoring it yeah that's gonna taste fucking awful you barely stirred it
2475800	2478200	like the spoon my wine is gonna taste awful
2478200	2489000	oh damn that would be so hard to do you guys better get in bed quick might be fast acting
2492440	2494120	sleeping meds it should take a while
2496520	2498280	but from an objective point of view
2498280	2507880	it's incredibly romantic damn yeah that's how you know she's not a woman
2508520	2513240	because otherwise she'd be mad right now she'd be menstruating violently
2518360	2525640	and now will joel and uh forehead come about and find them dead in their each other's arms in bed
2525640	2531560	so you're telling me dev lied extra hard they both died anyways well uh i did
2533480	2537160	now this is actually very very different i don't know if you recall kibbs but in the game
2537800	2546760	if you found all the logs um these two had a fight frank had run away from bill and died
2546760	2552920	somewhere out there and then you bring the news back to bill and bill is pissed about it
2553880	2561560	and he but also frank left a note basically saying you fucking destroyed my life i hate
2561560	2569960	you you ruined everything i'm glad to be free of you it's like it's jesus it's it's not a happy
2569960	2577640	ending i think i prefer this one this this one is more sad that one was more like damn
2577880	2582200	damn they still have gas for their generator after all these years
2582920	2588520	like i'm sorry my gas will have turned to fucking jello by this time oh power so long stay there
2590040	2593640	this is probably the next day or something still here the generator too
2596120	2597800	like at least turn it off at the end
2599800	2604200	i feel like they've got better things to worry about i'm sorry frank i'm just gonna have to
2604200	2607880	go outside and turn off the generator real quick before we die in our each other's arms
2609320	2613480	now that's what i call a fire hazard yeah you guys should put the candles too
2614600	2622280	the lights are still on yeah this is literally the next day yeah there's a heavy pattern of dust
2622280	2629640	on the thing maybe not yeah because that or is there or is it just the sun on the table it's
2629640	2636520	kind of yeah i see i see i'm not sure no maybe not no i think it might actually be just the
2636520	2640760	next day or no it's no no it's definitely all the next day no it's been a little bit yeah
2641640	2647320	yeah yeah you can see it clearly there the dust it's been a couple weeks maybe
2649640	2655560	something like that oh god your wide googly eyes not enormous forehead triggers me so
2656440	2656940	hello
2661080	2664600	it's quite the forehead though you can admire its power
2666600	2668360	hey joel here's the keys to the castle
2672280	2673720	oh she went outside what the fuck
2676680	2682120	yeah joel you really should keep a closer eye on that no well there she is i was just
2682120	2691000	windowing fuck bev to whomever but probably joe i figured i fell under whomever

2700680	2706760	they poisoned each other yeah somebody fucked up the dosage and lived so they're dead 2023
2706760	2711400	the last gay person on earth passed away if you find this please do not come into the bedroom
2712280	2718280	we left the window open so the house wouldn't smell it will probably be a sight i'm guessing
2718280	2723160	you found this joel because anyone else would have been electrocuted or blown up by one of my traps
2727160	2733240	at least he's a sick bastard the bunker code is the same as the gate code but in reverse
2734360	2740360	anyway i never liked you but still it's like we're friends almost

2803160	2806520	yeah it should be fading at some point shouldn't it i think it well

2810440	2813800	all right all right come here let me give you a cut and we'll see how it's like
2819240	2827800	no it's the bill mobile truck to be fair joel would be smart to try and start his own little
2827800	2837080	town out here holy shit this is still a fully stocked place this guy was a genius
2837800	2844760	a garand too grab some cans from over there nothing dented or swollen

2862360	2867720	five they haven't like the amount of shit this dude must have looted to last all these years
2867720	2872280	he had a whole town to loot yeah but even that's not that much shit
2874600	2880680	i'm taking a shower and then you're showering seriously damn
2880680	2892120	oh women fuck oh yeah just close it don't worry about that i mean the people here are dead but at
2892120	2897160	the same time god yeah i guess i'm the only one thinking about the future because i'm i'm really
2897160	2902840	like okay you know what they should do turn off everything when they leave like lock this place
2902840	2905720	up maybe it's useful in the future ah the woman gun
2908360	2912040	the night don't fuck i thought she was gonna look down the
2916200	2918760	the gun goes off in her backpack from throwing it around
2921800	2927640	and then an iconic rear view shot as they drive out the gate forgetting to turn off the generator
2927720	2931880	and all of the other valuable stuff there yep as the volume increases
2934680	2940040	yep and it stops being a radio broadcast it becomes actually a soundtrack
2942600	2946440	come on do the iconic rear view shot as they leave the game don't disappoint me baby
2947000	2948200	tv show whatever the fuck you are
2951000	2954600	i'm still gonna say bill died though i want to see how bill would talk to people
2954600	2961400	oh i'll take it i'll take it from the open window
2966280	2970360	camera the last rancid shot of the fucking desiccated skeletons
2973400	2975240	that's a little unnecessary don't do that
2975240	2984360	i think i'm gonna love you tasteful just the way i like it wow that was a surprisingly tasteful
2984360	2993240	episode yeah i didn't go too far i will say it feels like a bit of a fucking waste but what do
2993240	2998200	you mean look at this little pessimistic poly there was there was no actual story progression here
2998200	3004440	pretty much it was more of a thing for the uh people who played the video games to appreciate
3004440	3009400	these characters it also sets up that in this world despite all the tragedies despite all the
3009400	3015000	hardships and all the horrors that there were people that still were able to have find happiness
3015000	3021880	in life well it's not just that it is that but it's also the fact that if they were gonna include
3021880	3026440	like just these levels from the game they had to they had to flesh them out right because i don't
3026440	3031800	know if you recall the area around bill's place kibbs but there was a bunch of just like fetch
3031800	3036040	quests and you're going through like through a suburb and you're just finding stuff for bill
3036040	3039480	and he's like listen i'll help you out but you gotta do something for me go find this and it's
3039480	3045320	like it's it's video gamey right so they had if they're gonna put him in and put his story in
3045320	3049960	they had to do something different with it yep instead of it being a fetch quest which honestly
3049960	3055240	is a better way to wrap up his section of the thing and for people who played the video game
3055240	3060280	it actually adds quite a bit because it adds a lot more insight based on the notes about you know his
3060280	3067000	life that changed the more dark ending where frank just sort of fucks off and dies yeah
3068200	3072200	they changed the part where uh yeah they're actually estranged lovers and
3072200	3075800	frank dies and bill just cries about it in his house as you drive away
3075800	3079320	once upon a time i had somebody that i cared about
3083160	3086200	partner somebody i had to look after
3086200	3091720	and in this world that sort of shit's good for one thing getting you killed so you know what it
3091720	3097880	did why isn't the fuck up and i realized it's got to be just me bill today it ain't like that
3097880	3101080	it's bullshit it is just like that jesus
3103960	3105160	what do you know this guy or something
3107320	3113080	frank who the hell's frank he was my partner
3113080	3117960	he's the only idiot that would wear a shirt like that
3128200	3133960	he's got bites here and
3134840	3135720	here
3141880	3147400	i reckon he didn't want to turn so yeah i guess not
3152440	3161720	well fuck him that's my battery that fucking asshole jesus that's more of my stuff
3163960	3174600	so what you just just gonna steal my shit and run off is that it frank bill i uh
3175320	3178760	i found this in there and i uh i figured you should have it
3181480	3185160	and that's how you feel well fuck you too frank
3187960	3190680	fucking idiot you ready to go
3191560	3200200	you think well it's a bit more awkward but yes that's true it was a bit more tasteful and they
3200200	3204920	did it very tasteful too like when it came to the sex scenes they didn't they didn't make it weird
3204920	3210600	like a lot of hbo shows do and they also didn't do that thing where they could show the window
3210600	3216280	and show the corpses there be like look it's gritty like okay thank you kind of sour the
3216280	3221000	moment they understood that uh it had a very pleasant feel the whole episode
3221000	3227720	now what's the next part of the game kibbs you recall uh my memory's all screwed up i'm gonna
3227720	3232040	play last of us one like once and the problem is every time i'm thinking about the last of us i
3232040	3238040	keep i can't unsee the last of us part two sections i also keep mixing up with like the
3238040	3242440	early storylines of the walking dead because it's very similar the next bit is where they get
3242440	3249640	ambushed in pittsburgh remember that kibbs that there's that famous scene yeah he's like
3249640	3256600	he's not even injured and just like runs him over that's gonna that's gonna be great okay so i know
3256600	3262280	where we are in the plot now okay i'm still just not at all hooked into this show if anything if
3262280	3267800	there is any weakness to this show it is that for somebody who like me who doesn't have nostalgia
3267800	3275160	goggles for the show i'm not i'm just not interested well this was a this was a nice
3275160	3279400	gay romance and it's one of the most uh tasteful ones i think i've ever seen
3279960	3285960	but i was like i don't know these people it's it's more of a show written for what feels like
3285960	3293000	the people who played the video game and honestly yeah i'll take that i'll take that over what we
3293000	3298040	got with the halo show where it was meant for the general audience and not the halo fans
3298040	3301880	because that was the biggest fucking thing with the halo tv show that made it so bad
3301880	3306600	it had nothing to do with halo it had halo characters and their names thrown around
3306600	3312680	but miranda keys captain keys all these people they none of them were at all their characters
3312680	3320280	they were just skin suits here these characters feel much more alive and that i can appreciate
3320280	3325080	though i do understand arches point for the for the newcomer the person who's never played last
3325080	3331160	of us and whatnot like it's gonna come across as like hey like why did we have a huge background
3331160	3335640	story for some family when you could have done this differently because for from arches point
3335640	3339320	of view what would have been probably better for the newcomer would actually be taking use of
3339320	3344440	visual storytelling entering the room seeing the dust gathered seeing the pictures on the wall you
3344440	3348600	can disseminate you know the relationship of these two characters that are dead and they could it
3348680	3352440	would have been a much shorter and smaller sequence but you could have done it in a
3352440	3356600	different way i suppose to make it more approachable for newcomers but at the same
3356600	3361160	time it's a huge section of the game and it's really hard to just walk around it it kind of
3361160	3367720	had to be touched up on it does feel like this was made specifically for the fans at this point
3367720	3372680	because they spent so much time on a character that doesn't matter in terms of the actual story
3372680	3380200	but matters if you played the game it's better than the reverse fan service is better than
3380200	3387240	ignoring the fans yes that is absolutely correct and again it's still so far has actually proven
3387240	3392840	to be one of the the better video game adaptations it still lacks in some areas like that the mold
3392840	3400200	retcon just feels very unnecessary in my opinion unnecessary pointless and just flat out worse
3400200	3404920	than the original because i don't know i just don't know why they did it because the the tendril
3404920	3411160	idea of stepping on the spores currently they did it because they wanted to stomp out the last
3411160	3416680	piece of the check who made it yeah and the thing is i did see at the beginning of the episode well
3416680	3421400	i did actually like this one quite a bit neil drachman is still executive producer i believe
3421400	3427400	like the problem with him is he is actively he's he's being a douche like the original girl who
3427640	3433240	the last of us like made her story about these characters and set it up and it kind of seems
3433240	3439080	like every time she's done something kind of cool or really interesting he actively is trying to
3439080	3444760	sabotage her work like in last of us part two with sabotaging ellie's character and basically
3444760	3451960	fucking her up and making her out to be a terrible person like that's just kind of bad so it feels
3451960	3456920	like the show is hindered by neil drachman uh in the background honestly if they just lost him
3457000	3461640	i think the show would probably be doing a lot better how how is it actually doing in terms of
3461640	3467320	people watching it and like like reviews and stuff what i can't it's actually doing very well it
3467320	3473960	actually grew its audience after episode one which is very unusual yep because word of mouth that
3473960	3478200	happened with revenge of the sith when people uh during its launch like people were like i don't
3478200	3482520	know last two movies are a bit special and people hey it's actually pretty good and then people
3482520	3490600	started to go see it i'm gonna look for it on uh good old rotten tomatoes tomatoes oh my god jeez
3491240	3497240	97 tomato meter and 96 audience score i don't know if it's that good maybe people just need
3497240	3503880	something that's like decent nowadays and they'll just throw they'll throw 90s at it in the modern
3503880	3510120	world the house of dragons is a masterpiece because it's not complete shit and that's
3510120	3515560	it's actually tragic because our our standards have lowered quite a bit because everything that's
3515560	3524200	been coming out our standards have polarized because all we know is garbage or gems that's
3524200	3529000	actually lowered actually technically i was right i think arch is a bit no you're dumb it's not no
3529000	3535560	no you're dumb it's not what it means at all our standards have lowered no no no no you're lowered
3535560	3541880	too you know well if they uh if they keep going with the plot i don't know how many episodes
3541880	3545960	they're going to be in the season eight episodes ten episodes i'm not sure but if they keep going
3545960	3552760	with the main plot i mean we're this is about a quarter of the way through the game so i guess
3552760	3558600	we'll have to see i'll just see how long it takes the value of this episode is going to be apparent
3559160	3566760	at the end of it because this was an entire episode dedicated to back characters if this
3566760	3571320	ends up leaving the plot feeling rushed at the end then it will not have been worth it
3571960	3577400	oh true like if we get to the end of this see this season and we find out that all like it
3577400	3582280	feels rushed or any way like missing something then that means that this episode actually will
3582280	3587480	have detracted from the primary plot which is very bad but that's going to have to be found
3587480	3591560	out later on in the show i guess if they wanted to make a more contemporary show what they could
3591560	3595080	have done is they could have had them stop at bill's and then bill's place gets overrun and
3595080	3599720	then bill has to leave with them that's what a normal zombie story would do and then if you
3599720	3605560	wanted flashback later to bill's life after he's become a character that you care about i mean
3606360	3610920	i think a normal zombie story would would make a story like that just because you have to have a
3610920	3616600	reason to care about bill but like like i said before i think the the show just assumes that
3616600	3620760	you played the game and so you already care about him yep so you want to know about bill and frank
3620760	3624920	for the newcomer if we didn't tell barge about bill and frank well you'd be like who what the
3624920	3631800	fuck like this whole sequence would make no sense yeah and we also primed him for that fact that
3631800	3636360	that's also something to take into consideration the whole episode was spent dealing with them so
3636360	3640440	for a newcomer who's never played this before or played the video game they'll be like what
3640440	3647160	what why are we on this weird side tangent with these two characters that's gonna come out left
3647160	3652520	field a little bit for them so that's the end of the of the video oh i guess we should probably
3652520	3657880	point out that uh in the middle of the of the recording love love showed up and was like what
3657880	3666520	the fuck time zones man that's how it is dev's planning don't lie dev it's not just dev's planning
3666520	3671160	listen listen no she had to work tonight if we had actually waited for a little if we wouldn't
3671160	3679960	be starting till about right now that would be way too late for you arch yes yeah so hopefully next
3679960	3685320	time she won't have to work nights and she'll be here next time hopefully hopefully i guess that's
3685320	3690760	it huh yes that's the end oh i thought you were gonna do like an outro thing well me saying
3690760	3696760	hopefully is the outro maybe i don't know oh i don't know if i don't know if you've noticed
3696760	3701880	but i usually just end my videos whenever i fucking end them i just drop them you lazy little
3701880	3707320	town see i feel like you should you know be like all right see you guys you know later or something
3707320	3713160	you're just like get out of here all right fine then kibbs here's the outro here it is i'll do
3713160	3719480	one just for you okay the one episode that you two aren't massively homophobic is the one episode
3719480	3724280	that Lilith can't make it i can't believe it ah we'll have to get back to our act then
3724920	3731960	i've never been afraid of gay people he's like i just hate them
