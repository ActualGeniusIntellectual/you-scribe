WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
So, it's just the three of us today, unfortunately. Lilith is AWOL. She's missing. I don't know

00:08.920 --> 00:13.100
if Lilith got stuck back at work. She does work at like a smoothie store, so sometimes

00:13.100 --> 00:18.480
you're just like, fuck, you gotta stay late. Shit happens. Who knows? Unfortunately-

00:18.480 --> 00:21.440
What's a smoothie? The fucking smoothies must be made.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.440
Yeah.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.880
I would like a smoothie actually right now, fuck.

00:24.880 --> 00:28.800
I've never liked smoothies. They're fucking chunky and yucky and whatnot.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.800
Maybe you haven't had a good one. Maybe you haven't had a good one.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.800
Really? You don't like smoothies?

00:33.800 --> 00:37.280
Like chunky. Like what's chunky smoothie? Normally they're smooth.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.280
Yeah, you really gotta like, you really gotta blend that shit, Arch.

00:40.280 --> 00:45.500
In my country, smoothies are only made by like immigrants working at like minimum wage.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.560
They don't really care. Like there's not even milk in there. Like it stopped being milk

00:49.560 --> 00:56.520
a week ago. Now it's just like solidified yogurt with some bits of strawberries in it.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.840
I mean, you're supposed to use a little bit of yogurt, like whatever the fuck it's called,

01:00.840 --> 01:05.520
but like, I think you're smooth. If it's chunky, then they didn't make it right.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.640
Yeah. Also you can just make your own, man. Just get some frozen fruit, get some milk.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.640
A blender?

01:10.640 --> 01:11.640
Yeah, exactly.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.560
If I'm going to do that, I'm just going to eat the fruit.

01:14.560 --> 01:20.080
But a smoothie, you can drink it. It quenches your thirst and fills the tumpee.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.960
Yeah. And it's cold. You can have it on like a warm day. Wait, you're in Norway. There

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
are no warm days.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.600
Put me down. Thanks. That's a brilliant idea.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.600
Listen.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.600
Minus 30 or something.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.600
Well, wait.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.600
I just minus 30 here too.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.400
Yeah, it's actually very cold today.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
Yeah.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.440
My God, I wish I had something cold to drink.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.440
Well-

01:43.440 --> 01:46.440
What are you talking about? Like I go to Dairy Queen in the winter. If I'm driving by, I'm

01:46.440 --> 01:51.820
like, oh, I want a fucking, one of them little chocolate shaky thingies.

01:51.820 --> 01:59.180
In any case, in any case, Lilith isn't here. We are unfortunately on a pretty strict timetable,

01:59.180 --> 02:05.180
so we have to go without her. I'm sure she'll be back next week. Hopefully, maybe.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.180
Maybe doesn't even know.

02:06.180 --> 02:11.580
Before we get started, I do want to point something out. I mentioned last episode, the

02:11.580 --> 02:18.140
whole race baiting thing didn't really happen so much the same way that it happened with

02:18.140 --> 02:22.580
Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power or with Obi-Wan Kenobi hasn't really happened

02:22.580 --> 02:28.740
here so much. I did finally find one instance of the race baiting, and it was, of course,

02:28.740 --> 02:32.620
from marysue.com because why fucking wouldn't it be?

02:32.620 --> 02:38.700
And they say, predictable as always, racists are mad about the new The Last of Us posters

02:38.700 --> 02:39.700
and-

02:39.700 --> 02:40.700
Am I?

02:40.700 --> 02:45.460
Yeah. Wait, are you the people they're talking about here, Arch? So basically, this article

02:45.460 --> 02:50.580
is trying to make the claim that because Joel's daughter was race swap, which we did

02:50.580 --> 02:57.500
talk about last episode, people are angry and the fans are, this is fan backlash, it's

02:57.500 --> 03:01.980
fan entitlement and it's all this other nonsense that we've heard a thousand times before.

03:01.980 --> 03:07.820
However, when you talk about Kenobi or when you talk about the Rings of Power, there's

03:07.820 --> 03:13.180
reasons here that they could have that point of view. They're not very good reasons, but

03:13.180 --> 03:17.260
there's at least reasons. For this though, I haven't seen this at all. It's like they're

03:17.260 --> 03:22.940
trying to manufacture an outrage and like no one is biting. No one's saying anything

03:22.940 --> 03:24.140
about this shit.

03:24.140 --> 03:28.680
I will defend my dislike of Arrondir to the death.

03:28.680 --> 03:33.540
And even you said that Joel's half black daughter didn't actually matter in the end.

03:33.540 --> 03:37.460
Well, no, not because of their skin color. Like I don't hate Arrondir because he's Puerto

03:37.460 --> 03:40.500
Rican. I hate Arrondir because he can't act.

03:40.940 --> 03:45.660
Yeah, his acting is stiff. The thing is, if you get an actor, an actress, and they're

03:45.660 --> 03:50.780
not the correct race of a character that they're representing, you can get away with it sometimes

03:50.780 --> 03:55.260
if their performance is so stellar that, hey, they were the best one for the pick. It just

03:55.260 --> 03:57.300
so happened they had the wrong skin.

03:57.300 --> 04:01.180
It's why I actually really enjoyed Disa. Like she's probably one of the best characters

04:01.180 --> 04:02.700
in the Rings of Power.

04:02.700 --> 04:07.440
That's true. She was. Despite the fact that she wasn't accurate to the lore, she actually

04:07.440 --> 04:10.840
did a stellar performance. And that's honestly all that really matters.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.920
If they glued a fucking beard onto her, I would have no complaints about her.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.840
Now that you've mentioned the dwarves, Naomi and I recently watched The Witcher Blood Origins,

04:19.840 --> 04:24.000
which is awful. I don't know if it's even worth doing a video on, but it's so bad.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.120
Maybe I'll do a video on it.

04:26.120 --> 04:32.800
But like, I did one and it's just, it's my biggest takeaway. Like you could spend a lot

04:32.800 --> 04:39.620
of time critiquing the storyline, the acting, the presentation, the costumes. There really

04:39.620 --> 04:47.360
is no end. But my biggest complaint is that it manages to make mythical fantasy with a

04:47.360 --> 04:52.840
high age elven faction, boring and mundane.

04:52.840 --> 04:58.840
One thing I noticed is that that show didn't do bearded dwarf women either. And I'm like,

04:58.840 --> 05:04.080
hold on a second. Wasn't there a bearded dwarf woman in the main Witcher show? I was

05:04.080 --> 05:08.320
like, what? Why, why didn't you do it in this one? Netflix? What the fuck? But Naomi and

05:08.320 --> 05:12.320
I saw this. We were like, oh, I'm surprised they actually did it because this is the,

05:12.320 --> 05:16.360
this is the kind of thing Hollywood doesn't like to do, even though it would be body positive.

05:16.360 --> 05:21.800
And then they just didn't do it in, in blood origin. So what the fuck? Why?

05:21.800 --> 05:27.280
Was there, Oh God, see for a moment, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, like Dev must be

05:27.280 --> 05:34.760
why there were no dwarves in that show. And then I remembered that all female dwarf character.

05:34.760 --> 05:41.460
She's crazy. She was a dwarf. I fucking hated her so much. She, she put like her dead lover's

05:41.460 --> 05:46.280
ashes into her mace and went around killing people. It's so dumb. Cause the worst part

05:46.280 --> 05:52.400
is like, Oh, you killed my, my, um, lesbian lover. We didn't see this. We haven't been

05:52.400 --> 05:59.080
to like literally the only source we have for this is the clearly insane dwarven. And

05:59.080 --> 06:04.160
this thing too, I didn't even register her as a dwarf because she doesn't look like one.

06:04.160 --> 06:08.760
She looks like a little person. And since that is all she looks like, they have made

06:08.760 --> 06:16.780
no effort to make her look stocky or dwarven in the slightest. And so all I saw was a modern

06:16.780 --> 06:19.800
day little person. It was just Peter Dichlage to me.

06:19.800 --> 06:25.600
What did they call dwarves too? Anyway? Uh, God, okay. Okay. Devil politically correct.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.520
This word for midgets. Yeah. Arches. My mouth is open there. Cause I can't believe our just

06:30.520 --> 06:36.000
being PC. I was like, whoa, that's what is the politically correct term for midgets. Let's

06:36.000 --> 06:46.360
see a height challenged people. Oh Jesus. Yeah. When people, uh, if you must refer to

06:46.360 --> 06:53.560
someone by their condition, uh, dwarf dwarfism and little person or LP are acceptable LP.

06:53.560 --> 07:02.720
Yeah. Oh my God. We'll be a little, cause they're a little personal P and midget is

07:02.720 --> 07:07.240
considered derogatory. So there you go. And we got way the fuck off topic. My point was

07:07.240 --> 07:12.640
just to say, I think we've wandered slightly off topic here. Yeah. Yeah. My point was just

07:12.640 --> 07:17.560
to point out that unlike every other thing that we've seen in, in let's say the past

07:17.560 --> 07:22.800
year, um, this is the one time where the race swapping didn't seem political, didn't seem

07:22.800 --> 07:27.840
to matter, didn't impact anything. And the show is pretty good and yet they're still

07:27.840 --> 07:33.320
trying to make it into a political issue because that's what get clicks. Well, of course. Um,

07:33.320 --> 07:41.560
I actually, I saw an interesting article on this. I don't know if I saved it cause it

07:41.560 --> 07:47.280
was such a pathetic nothing burger. I think, I don't remember where it was, but it wasn't

07:47.280 --> 07:54.440
one of the usual baiting sites, right? Yep. And it was trying so hard to find something

07:54.440 --> 08:00.240
wrong with the last of us and you could tell they were fishing and I'm kind of sitting

08:00.240 --> 08:07.000
here like, why? You're, you're literally just trying to be the contrarian in the room now

08:07.000 --> 08:11.800
and Hey, I know I get accused of this. Like we get accused. It's like you only watch it

08:11.800 --> 08:19.480
cause it's bad. I'd prefer it if Obiwan was good. I wanted Obiwan to be good, but it wasn't.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.440
It's fair. A lot of the comments in the last video have been saying like, why are arch

08:23.440 --> 08:28.120
and Kib so negative? I'm so happy that Lilith gives them the Smackdown every now and then

08:28.120 --> 08:33.560
with some positivity. And I'm like, well guys, a little, it's not here today. It's not going

08:33.560 --> 08:43.720
to happen. I think, I think like, I think all three of us, not so much Lilith, but all

08:43.720 --> 08:48.440
three of us, we were like in nitpicky mode in the last, in the last video trying to find

08:48.440 --> 08:52.760
the flaws. We were just used to it at this point now, but now I'm like, Oh, it might

08:52.760 --> 08:58.520
actually be good. Well, yeah. I mean, how we did it last time is we were actually looking

08:58.520 --> 09:02.680
at it. We were all going into it with a very negative mindset because to be honest, we've

09:02.680 --> 09:08.600
had a string of terrible shows and it's, it's been exhaustive and it really sort of drains

09:08.600 --> 09:12.440
you. It was actually refreshing that the previous episode, cause we even said in the previous

09:12.440 --> 09:17.880
episode that it was actually not that bad. Listen to what we say, but that's my favorite

09:17.880 --> 09:25.280
part. See, I think like of TV that I've seen in the past five years or so, aside from this,

09:25.280 --> 09:29.920
the only thing that's been legitimately good is, uh, the boys is pretty good. Invincible

09:29.920 --> 09:35.840
was pretty good. Star Wars, Andor was pretty good. And this, and like everything else has

09:35.840 --> 09:41.920
just been raw fucking sewage. I was not fond of Andor. I haven't seen it. So I can't count

09:41.920 --> 09:47.000
it. It's, it's not bad. It's actually not bad. I was pleasantly surprised at how, how,

09:47.000 --> 09:54.360
you know, not amazing, but serviceable that it was the best parts of Andor would be so

09:54.360 --> 10:01.180
much better if Andor just wasn't there. That's my primary complaint. Like I would love to

10:01.180 --> 10:07.720
watch a TV show that goes more into depth about the, the, uh, the empire. Like the whole

10:07.720 --> 10:13.480
prison thing was really interesting. How they run a prison, the whole security detail and

10:13.480 --> 10:18.500
all of that shit. That was really interesting. Uh, even Mon Mothma, although she was the

10:18.500 --> 10:23.560
most modern current year of all the characters was all right and had some cool stuff. And

10:23.560 --> 10:29.840
I loved, uh, uh, uh, Peter, Peter Lindquist, the, the, the smuggler guy, you know, the

10:29.840 --> 10:34.800
guy who was starting the resistance. That was cool shit. I just wish Andor wasn't there.

10:34.800 --> 10:42.520
Well, don't worry. He dies later. It's okay. I know that. And that was the reason why I

10:42.520 --> 10:46.040
didn't care. Cause I'm like, I know he can't die. He's the, he's the one person in this

10:46.040 --> 10:52.800
show I know has the hand of God watching over him. He said he just died, didn't he? No,

10:52.800 --> 10:58.360
he dies in the future. Cause this is a prequel. Oh, this is dumb. See, there's only six star

10:58.360 --> 11:07.280
wars movies. You guys, you guys need to program here. Okay. Should we, now that we've spoken

11:07.280 --> 11:12.080
about every other TV show under the sun, do you want to watch the last of us? If you want

11:12.080 --> 11:15.360
to watch the last of us, I actually kind of do. I'm very curious as to how they're going

11:15.360 --> 11:20.600
to handle the next sequence. Oh, what happens next? I don't remember in the game. That doesn't

11:20.600 --> 11:23.600
matter. I guess. You know, yeah, that's not spoil it. Cause arch, you're still ignorant

11:23.600 --> 11:27.560
of all this, right? This is all still new to you. He hasn't played the last of us since

11:27.560 --> 11:33.560
we last talked. I don't think let's, uh, let's roll then. Here we go. I'm pressing play.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.840
Oh, there was no intro sequence this time with like some flashback or something. I'm

11:38.840 --> 11:46.120
sure we'll get to it now. Bangkok 2022. Don't get the parasites into the river parasites

11:46.120 --> 11:53.920
into your hand, man. That's cheating. You're almost supposed to go one there. Now you're

11:53.920 --> 11:58.780
definitely cheating. Well, you put a little pile of rocks there. You think that's still

11:58.780 --> 12:06.600
there after the filming of this, you just go out there and see it, kick it over. Well,

12:06.600 --> 12:11.320
there's I know for a fact, there's an abandoned subway station in Toronto. You can go down,

12:11.320 --> 12:15.240
you can like sneak down there and just see all the shit that various movie crews left

12:15.240 --> 12:22.000
behind because Hollywood goes up there to shoot like subway scenes all the time. Nice.

12:22.000 --> 12:33.360
But that's kind of cool. Yeah, it is. What about the sandwich? Yeah. I was about to say,

12:33.360 --> 12:38.360
what about the rest of the chicken sandwich? It didn't eat. It might've been a few days.

12:38.360 --> 12:47.400
In the wilderness now. Yeah. So we don't know how long it's been. Don't blame me for something

12:47.400 --> 12:54.080
that isn't my fault. Wow. You are the least lovable forehead I've ever met. You can still

12:54.080 --> 12:59.560
land a plane there though. How did you guys like the thumbnail for the last video? I loved

12:59.560 --> 13:06.600
it. It could have like, you could have enhanced the forehead a little further. I only barely

13:06.640 --> 13:14.000
enhanced it. I could, it was how, how little I needed to do was okay. Like I want you to set

13:14.000 --> 13:20.960
like a plane on it next time that's landed. Like as a man who has a sizable forehead himself,

13:20.960 --> 13:26.680
that thing is enormous. He's like, yeah, I can feel this power from here. People are the real

13:26.680 --> 13:32.280
monsters, sir. Wouldn't you not want to know if that was the case? Kibs, they changed something.

13:32.280 --> 13:40.440
I knew about this. Oh, they're driving weren't they? No, Bill and Frank. One of them was supposed

13:40.440 --> 13:47.520
to be dead, but that he's alive in this one. So we're going to see both of them. Oh, okay. No,

13:47.520 --> 13:55.120
I missed two. It happens more often than you think. Did you suck at shooting or like in general? Damn.

13:55.120 --> 14:04.600
Okay. That's kind of cute. I got to grab some stuff. I stashed. Why do you have stuff fast here?

14:04.600 --> 14:10.320
You ask a lot of goddamn questions. So he doesn't have to carry it the next time. He hasn't been out

14:10.320 --> 14:19.640
here in a year though. It might not be here. Entirely possible scavengers came by, but how

14:19.640 --> 14:23.640
many scavengers are there and how many scavengers are going to check out a random store? I'm

14:23.680 --> 14:37.640
presumably she hid it. Mortal Kombat 2. These lines would be better if it wasn't delivered by

14:37.640 --> 14:44.840
her. Like I cannot help, but she's just not the right character for this. I actually don't mind

14:44.840 --> 14:51.960
the snark between them. Oh no, I like the snark. I just don't like her delivery of it. Because the

14:51.960 --> 14:58.920
snark is definitely the thing that really did make the interactions of the video game. Made them

14:58.920 --> 15:09.240
endearing. Now I'd be scared personally. Don't fall in. Yeah, don't check with your flashlight

15:09.240 --> 15:18.440
down there first or anything. Oh, thank you. I expect something. Yeah, I wouldn't do that. I'm

15:18.440 --> 15:26.000
sorry. I'm a fucking pussy. I ain't going down for a minute. This is all new, isn't it? Where's

15:26.000 --> 15:34.840
the jump scare? I'm expecting it. It's too tense. It's gonna be here. Ah, she will reach for it.

15:34.840 --> 15:42.600
Don't do this to me, Cho. I don't like jump scares. It's gonna happen, Kibbs.

15:42.600 --> 15:51.240
There it is. It wasn't gonna be a jump scare? They were actually gonna be building like...

15:51.240 --> 15:59.800
Oh, he's sad. He's like, help, I'm stuck. Oh no. Now I'm surprised that he's not dead,

15:59.800 --> 16:05.000
because these aren't like zombies, you know? They're not dead that have been reanimated.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.680
They're still living things. Surely being crushed for this long would kill you. It might have

16:10.680 --> 16:16.040
happened recently. I mean, it had to have, because he hasn't fully turned, his eyes aren't fully

16:16.040 --> 16:21.160
covered. I just want to see you like start picking pieces of the mushroom off her. Jesus, what are you

16:21.160 --> 16:28.200
doing? That's pretty gross. Now, don't be a fucking monster. Like, just put them down.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.800
Yeah, actually, I don't mind that, because she's curious. Like, okay, what's actually inside of

16:35.800 --> 16:41.320
you, etc. It's like, wow, I let my hyper important cargo that I killed my fucking girlfriend for just

16:41.320 --> 16:49.320
kind of wander away. I mean, to his knowledge, she was only in that other room. No, you think

16:49.320 --> 16:54.120
he would have reacted to the clank sound, or the dragging sound, or the thumping sound.

17:05.560 --> 17:10.920
That gun's way too big for her. This is kind of stupid, though. Unless he's coming back for that

17:10.920 --> 17:16.280
thing fairly soon, that's not going to be fireable by the time he gets back. Yep, his plan is to

17:16.280 --> 17:21.480
return. That plane is remarkably intact, considering what happened to it. And how it landed, too.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.800
Pilot didn't do too bad. There probably was survivors. So, the tainted food all hits the

17:27.800 --> 17:33.640
store shelves around the same time Thursday. People bought it, ate some Thursday night or

17:33.640 --> 17:42.120
Friday morning. The day goes on. They started to get sick. Afternoon, evening, they got worse.

17:42.680 --> 17:48.440
I think this is all new. Then they started biting. Yeah, this is not a very good explanation,

17:48.440 --> 17:53.800
because food goes through a whole fucking hell of a lot of sterilization procedures and shit.

17:53.800 --> 18:00.840
Like, you wouldn't just get fungus in there on a national scale. Not only national, because of

18:00.840 --> 18:04.360
different plants around the world, but it would only be a local area that would be actually

18:04.360 --> 18:11.480
affected. And it would be soon. Flower Made in America isn't really flown to, like, everywhere.

18:11.800 --> 18:18.280
This would have to hit, like, every single source of a food supply and then be distributed across

18:18.280 --> 18:24.760
the globe. At the same time. Yeah, I know. Like, some grain reaches certain bakeries before other

18:24.760 --> 18:30.280
bakeries. They bake the food a day or a few days earlier. Hey, listen, this show turns out to be

18:30.280 --> 18:37.400
pretty basic. It's anti-globalist, anti-supply chain. Anti-government, too. Again, the only

18:37.400 --> 18:42.920
real complaint I have about this show so far is the whole change to the mushrooms is just a bad

18:42.920 --> 19:06.200
change. This is another thing, too. I don't know if this was in the game, but I don't think that

19:06.200 --> 19:12.760
would happen because it's going to be very difficult to get soldiers to cold-heartedly

19:12.760 --> 19:18.440
gun down civilians because there wasn't room at the fucking hospital. Yes, getting a soldier to

19:18.440 --> 19:24.040
start gunning down civilians, especially these civilians are fellow countrymen, is not easy.

19:24.040 --> 19:33.880
Some people easily will do it. It's like your families. Here's the flashback. Yeah.

19:33.960 --> 19:41.960
The thing is, that's the thing. Soldiers aren't mindless fucking

19:41.960 --> 19:45.560
trolls. This is Hollywood we're talking about here, aren't you?

19:48.200 --> 19:54.600
Hollywood is kind of anti-army, usually. Hollywood thinks that the military and the

19:54.600 --> 20:00.200
police are just these crypto-fascists waiting for orders from whoever happens to hold the

20:00.200 --> 20:11.880
reins of power. And they'll gun down whoever the fuck... Oh, yeah, so Bill and Frank,

20:11.880 --> 20:24.280
they were like the libertarians, eh? Yeah. Yeah, Bill... I think it was Bill who was the

20:24.280 --> 20:28.920
hardcore libertarian who was just like, I've been waiting for so fucking long for the world

20:28.920 --> 20:34.440
to collapse so I can live out here in peace. But he didn't live in a forest, he lived in a suburb.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.360
He's a base man. What a bossin.

20:40.600 --> 20:45.960
He's a collector. That's a selection. Yep. I like he's got Waterloo, the great weasel of lies down

20:45.960 --> 20:52.040
there. Oh my god, look, he put on a gas mask. How hard was it for him? Now that's an actor I

20:52.040 --> 20:58.280
respect already. Look at that. I think I know who this guy is, so I get recognized his voice.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.160
In fact, he's willing to wear a gas mask. This fucking guy.

21:03.560 --> 21:07.560
I don't think I would have chosen the shotgun to go out hunting the feds, but... Basically,

21:07.560 --> 21:13.320
the feds came through, evacuated everyone, and if you couldn't go, they killed you. He smiled. Oh,

21:13.320 --> 21:19.960
it is? It's the fucking guy from... Oh god, what's that show? Oh fuck, I can't remember.

21:21.880 --> 21:26.440
I'm actually glad they picked him, though. He's gonna go fishing.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.760
Might as well. Might as well.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.920
This must be heaven for him. I mean, the power's still on, so you might as well...

21:38.920 --> 21:44.520
Yep, it's gonna be off soon. Yeah. That was fast. That was fast,

21:44.520 --> 21:50.200
unironically. Only lasted a day. All my commenters were saying that the feds couldn't shut off their

21:50.200 --> 21:54.920
gas stoves. Yes, they fucking could. He had to turn it back on. I like this scene a lot.

21:55.640 --> 22:00.920
The doomsday prepper gets what he wants. Yep. There's gonna be some traps.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.400
I actually really appreciate these flashback scenes when it's like this.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.440
Showing us the characters before. I didn't appreciate the previous ones,

22:08.440 --> 22:11.640
but this one's nice. The previous one was bad, but this one... He's growing veggies.

22:12.280 --> 22:19.160
He's got chickens. Yeah, man. He's gonna be living a good life. Yeah. I want to point out that

22:19.160 --> 22:24.280
everyone that's in the federal camps are starving to death right now, or having food shortages.

22:25.800 --> 22:30.840
This guy's living the time of his life. It's gonna get a little lonely, though.

22:30.840 --> 22:35.720
No, he turned back on the electricity, or is that the generator? What did he do at the gas plant?

22:36.440 --> 22:42.600
He turned back on the natural gas to the city. You would have thought that this guy like this

22:42.600 --> 22:47.080
would have an independent gas supply, like, you know, the gas canisters in the stove.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.400
But here comes a zombie.

23:01.320 --> 23:07.960
The show is growing on me more. Oh, he's like turned the suburb into a...

23:09.880 --> 23:14.680
He's like built a gate and all this shit. Damn. Yep. Don't tread on me.

23:14.680 --> 23:18.200
Oh, my God. I think he has a Windows XP computer.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.120
Looks like it. Well, if you don't want your shit to crash.

23:24.920 --> 23:31.320
I mean, I just like the attention to detail. That's great. Baltimore QZ. It's gone.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.400
Damn. You're hurt. How did he fall into the hole?

23:38.600 --> 23:42.360
He was down. He camouflaged it with a fucking chicken net. That thing would be hard to see.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.800
He's how the hell did he get one of the federal scanners?

23:48.200 --> 23:49.880
He probably just killed some of them while they were out.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.000
They might have left him in some areas.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.840
And every bum you talk to about it is going to show up here looking for a free lunch.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.160
And this is not an Arby's.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.840
Free lunch was a restaurant.

24:03.800 --> 24:08.120
I mean, after four years, the isolation is bound to be getting at him.

24:08.120 --> 24:12.920
Yeah. In fact, I'm kind of shocked that he hasn't gone literally insane yet.

24:14.360 --> 24:18.280
I just noticed that this guy is Ron Swanson. Jesus.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.280
Yes. That's why I'm so glad they got him. He played Ron Swanson.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.640
It's like the same character.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.720
Yep. This is a stellar pick, by the way.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.920
Well, I wish you were hot blonde, but I guess you'll have to do.

24:38.120 --> 24:42.440
What? What just happened?

24:44.120 --> 24:46.600
I'm just looking around and he's suspicious.

24:49.000 --> 24:49.960
He's so happy.

24:51.720 --> 24:55.320
It's like, yeah, that is the correct response, though,

24:55.320 --> 24:58.440
considering what he's probably been so used to is.

24:59.400 --> 24:59.960
You're welcome.

24:59.960 --> 25:09.000
Oh, this is a heartwarming scene, you know.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.080
It is so I guess I'll be going on.

25:13.080 --> 25:13.580
This is you.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.960
He's reading them like a book.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.600
Yeah. Oh, my God.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.200
It's my favorite.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.960
He's like, I'm a musician. I'm valuable.

25:30.680 --> 25:31.720
I can raise morale.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.400
It's been a little bit. Give me a break.

25:42.680 --> 25:45.480
Oh, sure. How long since that piano was?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.080
Oh, no, they're going to get tangled.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.560
So he's going to be alive now.

25:57.560 --> 26:03.480
Yeah, because in the original game, he was dead.

26:04.920 --> 26:10.200
And that's why it was super abrasive, if I'm right, or was it drunk?

26:10.200 --> 26:14.600
I can't remember something like a weird or about him because he was gone.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.480
So, wait, Arch, how how did your gaydar go off on this?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.440
Quite a while ago, honestly.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.040
No, it's it's obvious.

26:22.040 --> 26:28.120
Even if you don't know, this was charged for quite a while now.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.360
So it wasn't spoiled for you?

26:32.040 --> 26:35.960
No, because for me, it's like I was sitting there thinking like,

26:35.960 --> 26:37.400
this is probably going to be the gay scene.

26:38.440 --> 26:42.680
See? Well, this isn't anything new because this is how it was in the original game.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.080
So it's not always a thing.

26:45.080 --> 26:50.040
But this is more like an origin story to how I will say it was a little bit forced.

26:50.040 --> 26:53.800
Like this was I don't know, like I didn't mind this.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.640
This is actually decent because they're in the apocalypse.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.240
Like the guy's been lonely for four years.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.560
They're they're both nervous.

27:02.040 --> 27:09.320
But this guy, the guy on the bed, he comes across as a little bit too seductory.

27:09.960 --> 27:10.840
You have the other guy.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.000
The other guy's doing a better job.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.680
It doesn't like actually, I think this guy is doing a better job because he's.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.120
I like him a lot as an actor.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.520
Because they're the guy on the bed.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.960
He comes across as way too suave for this.

27:23.960 --> 27:27.080
Like, wait, no, I don't want a sex scene, though.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.600
Like the romance is fine.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.040
No, Kim's got to watch it.

27:30.840 --> 27:35.720
No, it feels a pinch forced.

27:35.720 --> 27:41.240
I feel like instead of a scene, this should be their relationship after a week

27:41.240 --> 27:42.520
or a month or two.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.280
But I guess time constraints.

27:44.280 --> 27:50.360
So, man, see, I like everything except for like, I don't like I don't need to watch.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.920
I have sex for lunches.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.360
That's fair, even great ones.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.160
Come on, that was at least a dinner.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.760
It's a bit cheap.

28:09.640 --> 28:14.760
I didn't really pick up on anything gay until the piano.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.880
Even though I knew that they were gay because the game.

28:17.880 --> 28:23.240
But like, still, I had pent up on the gay around the shower scene.

28:24.280 --> 28:30.840
Oh, the shower scene, the shower scene, because he acted very giddy, like nervous around it.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.800
Like he was in the shower.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.880
He was like, Oh, my God, you're in the shower.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.680
Yeah, oh, come on.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.720
Hey, would you stop?

28:43.720 --> 28:44.440
I like that.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.600
It wasn't actually just a sex scene noise.

28:47.240 --> 28:52.440
You live in a psycho bunker where 9-11 was an inside job and the government are all Nazis.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.440
The government are all Nazis.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.960
OK, hold on a second.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.960
I'll pause there for a second.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.840
I need to tweet.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.840
That's brilliant.

29:06.840 --> 29:07.400
I love it.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.080
Oh, man, this might be my favorite episode yet.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.800
Yeah, this is pretty good.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.240
You know, it's actually kind of refreshing.

29:17.240 --> 29:17.960
And you know what?

29:17.960 --> 29:21.240
For an HBO show, I was worried they were going to go the gross path where it's like,

29:21.560 --> 29:22.120
pep.

29:22.120 --> 29:25.960
And I was like, oh, but they actually just like they cut to black.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.640
They cut or they did not cut back.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.960
They cut the screen before anything started.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.800
And that's good, because the important part about the show is you to tell the story

29:33.800 --> 29:36.920
and narrative elements and the relationships between the two characters.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.400
You don't need to focus on the non-essentials.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.320
The flat flaps the groups.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.400
You have it, kids, you're out here getting your cheeks plapped all the time.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.480
Listen, that's for money.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.360
That's a different again.

29:50.360 --> 29:56.040
this it was a little bit too obvious in my opinion because the other guy came across as overtly

29:56.040 --> 30:02.360
sexual quite early on and he he comes across as way too much of a seductress i don't see it at all

30:02.360 --> 30:07.880
i mean it's just me i like bill zach what the fuck's his name he's he's fucking stellar i i

30:07.880 --> 30:14.120
think it's absolutely hilarious how bill does the whole 9 11 truth of the government are all nazis

30:14.840 --> 30:19.320
and it turns out he was right but there's like a weird left right overlap here

30:19.960 --> 30:24.680
where you have like the libertarians who sometimes say the exact same thing as the socialists

30:24.680 --> 30:29.880
about government well in this universe the the government basically was too

30:31.320 --> 30:35.560
too super controlling didn't relinquish power are you are you pissing there kibbs jesus

30:36.120 --> 30:40.760
oh sorry i was pouring myself some tea oh okay listen your mic's all fixed now your mic's fixed

30:40.760 --> 30:45.400
we can hear that at this point oh damn that picked that up yeah i was pouring myself some more tea

30:45.400 --> 30:48.200
i wasn't peeing into the cup i swear

30:50.840 --> 30:56.120
but uh yeah i actually think that's pretty cool also they chose the best actor to play bill

30:56.120 --> 31:01.240
yeah they did they should have done like he meets him he picks him up and they kind of like okay

31:01.240 --> 31:06.280
you can say you can stay the night and then like three days later then you do the piano scene or

31:06.280 --> 31:12.040
something yeah i would have liked this to be a little bit less starstruck romance but i'm gayer

31:12.040 --> 31:18.040
than you fixing up some of the shops yes bill is the more masculine ones are we hosting formal

31:18.040 --> 31:28.920
garden parties now no there might be but we are gonna have friends excuse me he wants to build a

31:28.920 --> 31:34.120
town yep he wants to build the community i've actually been talking to a nice woman on the radio

31:34.120 --> 31:39.400
you what that's not gonna be fucking happy

31:41.240 --> 31:46.280
right this is that that is actually extraordinarily stupid okay we have all of these resources here

31:46.280 --> 31:51.720
uh would you like to uh come on over and sample some of them i'm the same way this is how they

31:51.720 --> 31:57.960
met i'm not schizophrenic he's gonna pull out the gun he has under the table which i get by the way

31:58.840 --> 32:02.680
how nice this is to have a civilized meal in such a beautiful place

32:03.480 --> 32:08.680
he doesn't oh that's disappointing i mean that's way more fun we don't end up working together

32:09.720 --> 32:12.520
they made both of them look a lot younger working together

32:13.560 --> 32:16.920
the actors and actresses i mean like they are younger in the in the story but like

32:16.920 --> 32:22.680
they really de-age them nicely with makeup or age them up with makeup in the present whatever

32:22.680 --> 32:28.200
i want to show you something not inside frank frank

32:31.400 --> 32:32.920
bill's mad yep

32:39.560 --> 32:47.320
i understand i still want him to be holding a gun under the table he'll come at night quiet and armed

32:47.320 --> 32:53.880
that is true i mean this place screams easy pickings

32:56.600 --> 33:00.360
yeah you need more people here you need a little town not just the two of you

33:02.520 --> 33:09.000
more manpower would be useful for defense yeah those traps in that fence is not going

33:09.000 --> 33:16.440
to be an obstacle to people with tools well organized hungry looking for resources

33:17.320 --> 33:25.160
um well they put a bunch of fucking cars he's fortified a bit like i can't

33:25.880 --> 33:32.920
just one more loop around i got something to show you huh not that

33:33.800 --> 33:36.520
oh

33:40.360 --> 33:41.160
he got excited

33:43.800 --> 33:50.520
it's radishes it looks like strawberries

33:50.520 --> 33:55.160
a little one a little one

34:01.560 --> 34:04.840
i expected it to be more pissed about that and yeah they were strawberries you thought

34:04.840 --> 34:10.840
they were radishes it's close to these strawberry bushes yummy strawberry they're very tiny

34:10.840 --> 34:16.360
strawberry not natural strawberries by the way those are modern day bio-engineered berries yeah

34:17.160 --> 34:23.320
chunky at my uh girlfriend's childhood home they have strawberry bushes in the back and

34:23.320 --> 34:30.280
they're much bigger bushes with much smaller berries yes those are modern day strawberries

34:32.680 --> 34:36.040
this episode has actually been pretty good at building these two characters up yep

34:36.040 --> 34:44.600
so

34:44.600 --> 34:48.840
yeah no this is actually probably the single best gay romance i think i've ever seen

34:48.840 --> 34:49.800
i'm quite enjoying this

34:51.880 --> 34:58.200
a rain catcher uh-oh stormy night that means shit's about to go down boys prepare for some

34:58.200 --> 35:08.920
tragedy they're ready okay that's more than a little stereotypical but

35:13.080 --> 35:21.240
flame throwers yes i was about to say like holy fuck hey you gotta wake up dude it's time

35:21.240 --> 35:24.280
oh shit

35:41.240 --> 35:45.400
he's just taking him out yep bill's already out there

35:46.120 --> 35:54.440
he's going to help yep the woman has armed herself with a ppk and it's going to come help

36:02.920 --> 36:04.200
dude just stay in the house

36:06.680 --> 36:08.760
he's just in the middle of the fucking street

36:15.480 --> 36:20.680
get inside he's gonna yeah i was about to say he's gonna get him killed

36:22.520 --> 36:28.520
we gotta get you inside no no to be fair it was bloody retarded for him to stand in the

36:28.520 --> 36:36.120
middle of the street fucking illuminated by the fire okay i think it's time for the bandits to

36:36.120 --> 36:44.680
call it quits that's a lot of casualties yep he'll take care of you

36:45.400 --> 36:54.680
you lied to me dev i lied to you

36:59.320 --> 37:00.520
he died

37:04.440 --> 37:05.720
oh definitely looks like he died

37:09.000 --> 37:12.120
yeah there's no way because bill's the one that survives out of the two in the game

37:12.920 --> 37:20.040
oh thank god there's no wheelchair now oh damn they're a little old oh no the other one's in a

37:20.040 --> 37:26.760
wheelchair okay oh no uh so you just kind of skipped over the whole recovery period he's just

37:26.760 --> 37:31.400
he's he's fine now bill's the one recovered the other guys in the wheelchair dead not good

37:31.400 --> 37:43.400
i mean 10 years you can recover in 10 years yeah but i i would have liked to seen it rather than

37:43.400 --> 37:47.400
just like yeah he was fine damn they did a better job of aging these guys up than the obi-wan show

37:47.400 --> 37:54.840
did aging anakin down yeah did you see that somebody used a snapchat filter and did a better

37:54.920 --> 38:01.240
job yeah that was sad so he must be ill or something

38:05.240 --> 38:07.160
yeah that looks like some sort of

38:09.320 --> 38:12.840
what is it where joe biden can't draw a clock what's that called again

38:14.120 --> 38:21.000
he's having a hard time eating yeah yeah i i don't necessarily think this is illness i think this is

38:21.000 --> 38:24.520
old because that's a pretty good painting everything is it i know he's a prepper but

38:24.520 --> 38:29.640
he should have spent the past 20 years building a little town rather than just living like this you

38:29.640 --> 38:35.960
know if they had a community that would probably would have made them stronger in the end but yeah

38:36.600 --> 38:44.280
yep now they're gonna die alone sad and childless i should have taken a little child orphan that

38:44.280 --> 38:49.880
wandered by the fence that didn't blow up yeah that didn't get the shotgun or something like

38:49.880 --> 38:56.600
oh look this one's alive i want to keep it i want to keep a little suicide on top at all just to

38:56.600 --> 39:01.960
make it extra sad what if what if someone he shows up there wasn't anything to cure this before the

39:01.960 --> 39:07.720
world fell apart oh this is cancer oh he's terminal you'll wear what i ask

39:11.560 --> 39:17.240
who will get married it's time for drag queen story hour you cook a delicious dinner

39:20.520 --> 39:23.880
and then i'm going to take all of these

39:26.360 --> 39:31.880
he pranted flowers

39:39.400 --> 39:45.560
where did they get the paint from they could probably make it also entirely popularly it

39:45.560 --> 39:50.760
was dried paint and all they do is moisturize it home depot traded for it anything

39:53.480 --> 39:57.400
in the eyes of god you're still degenerates

39:59.640 --> 40:05.800
damn it's true though yeah it's true though i mean marriage is more of a christian thing anyways

40:06.760 --> 40:17.160
i know filthy christian i'm a heathen i am when it suits me fair enough rabbits like their first

40:17.160 --> 40:25.720
meeting i guess nice touch a lot of this is unique to the show they didn't go into nearly

40:25.720 --> 40:30.840
as much detail yeah now the problem with crushing pills and your alcohol is that it's gonna taste

40:30.840 --> 40:37.480
like ass afterwards yeah that's why you should just be a man and gulp them down immediately

40:39.480 --> 40:42.440
well now they're gonna do it here comes the meal first

40:43.960 --> 40:49.720
okay i gotta point out they've still got a wine left after like 20 30 years he must have had

40:49.720 --> 40:56.920
quite the fucking stock well also the wine store remember yeah true but even a wine store there's

40:56.920 --> 41:01.960
yeah true but even a wine store there's a limit to how much wine is in that store

41:01.960 --> 41:05.880
i don't think they're drinking wine every day probably only special occasions you know

41:05.880 --> 41:12.280
savoring it yeah that's gonna taste fucking awful you barely stirred it

41:15.800 --> 41:18.200
like the spoon my wine is gonna taste awful

41:18.200 --> 41:29.000
oh damn that would be so hard to do you guys better get in bed quick might be fast acting

41:32.440 --> 41:34.120
sleeping meds it should take a while

41:36.520 --> 41:38.280
but from an objective point of view

41:38.280 --> 41:47.880
it's incredibly romantic damn yeah that's how you know she's not a woman

41:48.520 --> 41:53.240
because otherwise she'd be mad right now she'd be menstruating violently

41:58.360 --> 42:05.640
and now will joel and uh forehead come about and find them dead in their each other's arms in bed

42:05.640 --> 42:11.560
so you're telling me dev lied extra hard they both died anyways well uh i did

42:13.480 --> 42:17.160
now this is actually very very different i don't know if you recall kibbs but in the game

42:17.800 --> 42:26.760
if you found all the logs um these two had a fight frank had run away from bill and died

42:26.760 --> 42:32.920
somewhere out there and then you bring the news back to bill and bill is pissed about it

42:33.880 --> 42:41.560
and he but also frank left a note basically saying you fucking destroyed my life i hate

42:41.560 --> 42:49.960
you you ruined everything i'm glad to be free of you it's like it's jesus it's it's not a happy

42:49.960 --> 42:57.640
ending i think i prefer this one this this one is more sad that one was more like damn

42:57.880 --> 43:02.200
damn they still have gas for their generator after all these years

43:02.920 --> 43:08.520
like i'm sorry my gas will have turned to fucking jello by this time oh power so long stay there

43:10.040 --> 43:13.640
this is probably the next day or something still here the generator too

43:16.120 --> 43:17.800
like at least turn it off at the end

43:19.800 --> 43:24.200
i feel like they've got better things to worry about i'm sorry frank i'm just gonna have to

43:24.200 --> 43:27.880
go outside and turn off the generator real quick before we die in our each other's arms

43:29.320 --> 43:33.480
now that's what i call a fire hazard yeah you guys should put the candles too

43:34.600 --> 43:42.280
the lights are still on yeah this is literally the next day yeah there's a heavy pattern of dust

43:42.280 --> 43:49.640
on the thing maybe not yeah because that or is there or is it just the sun on the table it's

43:49.640 --> 43:56.520
kind of yeah i see i see i'm not sure no maybe not no i think it might actually be just the

43:56.520 --> 44:00.760
next day or no it's no no it's definitely all the next day no it's been a little bit yeah

44:01.640 --> 44:07.320
yeah yeah you can see it clearly there the dust it's been a couple weeks maybe

44:09.640 --> 44:15.560
something like that oh god your wide googly eyes not enormous forehead triggers me so

44:16.440 --> 44:16.940
hello

44:21.080 --> 44:24.600
it's quite the forehead though you can admire its power

44:26.600 --> 44:28.360
hey joel here's the keys to the castle

44:32.280 --> 44:33.720
oh she went outside what the fuck

44:36.680 --> 44:42.120
yeah joel you really should keep a closer eye on that no well there she is i was just

44:42.120 --> 44:51.000
windowing fuck bev to whomever but probably joe i figured i fell under whomever

44:52.840 --> 44:59.960
him was this so he's dead now no that's kind of lame i was gonna be accidentally survived

45:00.680 --> 45:06.760
they poisoned each other yeah somebody fucked up the dosage and lived so they're dead 2023

45:06.760 --> 45:11.400
the last gay person on earth passed away if you find this please do not come into the bedroom

45:12.280 --> 45:18.280
we left the window open so the house wouldn't smell it will probably be a sight i'm guessing

45:18.280 --> 45:23.160
you found this joel because anyone else would have been electrocuted or blown up by one of my traps

45:27.160 --> 45:33.240
at least he's a sick bastard the bunker code is the same as the gate code but in reverse

45:34.360 --> 45:40.360
anyway i never liked you but still it's like we're friends almost

45:40.920 --> 45:44.440
and they kept a bit of that spirit in there if i never liked you

45:48.040 --> 45:49.640
yeah a bit late sorry about that

45:51.480 --> 45:52.200
hold that tongue

45:55.080 --> 46:00.920
try to keep tris alive okay wish you told me that sooner yes not tris that was close

46:03.160 --> 46:07.320
keep her safe joel definitely don't let her blow up in a building full of zombies

46:07.320 --> 46:12.280
that'd be fucked up don't get weird ntr'd with a like tentacle kisser that's very descriptive

46:12.280 --> 46:17.400
i know but i have a feeling yeah definitely don't let her choke on any fungus once you're not around

46:18.360 --> 46:19.080
we're kind of weird

46:23.320 --> 46:24.600
sick how did he know that

46:27.560 --> 46:29.320
pablo is having an emotional moment

46:29.320 --> 46:42.440
that cut on his cheek just never seems to grow does it grow grow close you mean heal

46:43.160 --> 46:46.520
yeah it should be fading at some point shouldn't it i think it well

46:46.520 --> 46:49.480
it takes a couple days yeah but it's been a couple of days

46:50.440 --> 46:53.800
all right all right come here let me give you a cut and we'll see how it's like

46:59.240 --> 47:07.800
no it's the bill mobile truck to be fair joel would be smart to try and start his own little

47:07.800 --> 47:17.080
town out here holy shit this is still a fully stocked place this guy was a genius

47:17.800 --> 47:24.760
a garand too grab some cans from over there nothing dented or swollen

47:27.640 --> 47:30.280
dude no the winchester let it have the winchester

47:33.240 --> 47:35.720
those aren't cans you stupid fucking

47:38.760 --> 47:41.480
oh listen toilet paper toiletries are a pleasantry

47:42.360 --> 47:47.720
five they haven't like the amount of shit this dude must have looted to last all these years

47:47.720 --> 47:52.280
he had a whole town to loot yeah but even that's not that much shit

47:54.600 --> 48:00.680
i'm taking a shower and then you're showering seriously damn

48:00.680 --> 48:12.120
oh women fuck oh yeah just close it don't worry about that i mean the people here are dead but at

48:12.120 --> 48:17.160
the same time god yeah i guess i'm the only one thinking about the future because i'm i'm really

48:17.160 --> 48:22.840
like okay you know what they should do turn off everything when they leave like lock this place

48:22.840 --> 48:25.720
up maybe it's useful in the future ah the woman gun

48:28.360 --> 48:32.040
the night don't fuck i thought she was gonna look down the

48:36.200 --> 48:38.760
the gun goes off in her backpack from throwing it around

48:41.800 --> 48:47.640
and then an iconic rear view shot as they drive out the gate forgetting to turn off the generator

48:47.720 --> 48:51.880
and all of the other valuable stuff there yep as the volume increases

48:54.680 --> 49:00.040
yep and it stops being a radio broadcast it becomes actually a soundtrack

49:02.600 --> 49:06.440
come on do the iconic rear view shot as they leave the game don't disappoint me baby

49:07.000 --> 49:08.200
tv show whatever the fuck you are

49:11.000 --> 49:14.600
i'm still gonna say bill died though i want to see how bill would talk to people

49:14.600 --> 49:21.400
oh i'll take it i'll take it from the open window

49:26.280 --> 49:30.360
camera the last rancid shot of the fucking desiccated skeletons

49:33.400 --> 49:35.240
that's a little unnecessary don't do that

49:35.240 --> 49:44.360
i think i'm gonna love you tasteful just the way i like it wow that was a surprisingly tasteful

49:44.360 --> 49:53.240
episode yeah i didn't go too far i will say it feels like a bit of a fucking waste but what do

49:53.240 --> 49:58.200
you mean look at this little pessimistic poly there was there was no actual story progression here

49:58.200 --> 50:04.440
pretty much it was more of a thing for the uh people who played the video games to appreciate

50:04.440 --> 50:09.400
these characters it also sets up that in this world despite all the tragedies despite all the

50:09.400 --> 50:15.000
hardships and all the horrors that there were people that still were able to have find happiness

50:15.000 --> 50:21.880
in life well it's not just that it is that but it's also the fact that if they were gonna include

50:21.880 --> 50:26.440
like just these levels from the game they had to they had to flesh them out right because i don't

50:26.440 --> 50:31.800
know if you recall the area around bill's place kibbs but there was a bunch of just like fetch

50:31.800 --> 50:36.040
quests and you're going through like through a suburb and you're just finding stuff for bill

50:36.040 --> 50:39.480
and he's like listen i'll help you out but you gotta do something for me go find this and it's

50:39.480 --> 50:45.320
like it's it's video gamey right so they had if they're gonna put him in and put his story in

50:45.320 --> 50:49.960
they had to do something different with it yep instead of it being a fetch quest which honestly

50:49.960 --> 50:55.240
is a better way to wrap up his section of the thing and for people who played the video game

50:55.240 --> 51:00.280
it actually adds quite a bit because it adds a lot more insight based on the notes about you know his

51:00.280 --> 51:07.000
life that changed the more dark ending where frank just sort of fucks off and dies yeah

51:08.200 --> 51:12.200
they changed the part where uh yeah they're actually estranged lovers and

51:12.200 --> 51:15.800
frank dies and bill just cries about it in his house as you drive away

51:15.800 --> 51:19.320
once upon a time i had somebody that i cared about

51:23.160 --> 51:26.200
partner somebody i had to look after

51:26.200 --> 51:31.720
and in this world that sort of shit's good for one thing getting you killed so you know what it

51:31.720 --> 51:37.880
did why isn't the fuck up and i realized it's got to be just me bill today it ain't like that

51:37.880 --> 51:41.080
it's bullshit it is just like that jesus

51:43.960 --> 51:45.160
what do you know this guy or something

51:47.320 --> 51:53.080
frank who the hell's frank he was my partner

51:53.080 --> 51:57.960
he's the only idiot that would wear a shirt like that

52:08.200 --> 52:13.960
he's got bites here and

52:14.840 --> 52:15.720
here

52:21.880 --> 52:27.400
i reckon he didn't want to turn so yeah i guess not

52:32.440 --> 52:41.720
well fuck him that's my battery that fucking asshole jesus that's more of my stuff

52:43.960 --> 52:54.600
so what you just just gonna steal my shit and run off is that it frank bill i uh

52:55.320 --> 52:58.760
i found this in there and i uh i figured you should have it

53:01.480 --> 53:05.160
and that's how you feel well fuck you too frank

53:07.960 --> 53:10.680
fucking idiot you ready to go

53:11.560 --> 53:20.200
you think well it's a bit more awkward but yes that's true it was a bit more tasteful and they

53:20.200 --> 53:24.920
did it very tasteful too like when it came to the sex scenes they didn't they didn't make it weird

53:24.920 --> 53:30.600
like a lot of hbo shows do and they also didn't do that thing where they could show the window

53:30.600 --> 53:36.280
and show the corpses there be like look it's gritty like okay thank you kind of sour the

53:36.280 --> 53:41.000
moment they understood that uh it had a very pleasant feel the whole episode

53:41.000 --> 53:47.720
now what's the next part of the game kibbs you recall uh my memory's all screwed up i'm gonna

53:47.720 --> 53:52.040
play last of us one like once and the problem is every time i'm thinking about the last of us i

53:52.040 --> 53:58.040
keep i can't unsee the last of us part two sections i also keep mixing up with like the

53:58.040 --> 54:02.440
early storylines of the walking dead because it's very similar the next bit is where they get

54:02.440 --> 54:09.640
ambushed in pittsburgh remember that kibbs that there's that famous scene yeah he's like

54:09.640 --> 54:16.600
he's not even injured and just like runs him over that's gonna that's gonna be great okay so i know

54:16.600 --> 54:22.280
where we are in the plot now okay i'm still just not at all hooked into this show if anything if

54:22.280 --> 54:27.800
there is any weakness to this show it is that for somebody who like me who doesn't have nostalgia

54:27.800 --> 54:35.160
goggles for the show i'm not i'm just not interested well this was a this was a nice

54:35.160 --> 54:39.400
gay romance and it's one of the most uh tasteful ones i think i've ever seen

54:39.960 --> 54:45.960
but i was like i don't know these people it's it's more of a show written for what feels like

54:45.960 --> 54:53.000
the people who played the video game and honestly yeah i'll take that i'll take that over what we

54:53.000 --> 54:58.040
got with the halo show where it was meant for the general audience and not the halo fans

54:58.040 --> 55:01.880
because that was the biggest fucking thing with the halo tv show that made it so bad

55:01.880 --> 55:06.600
it had nothing to do with halo it had halo characters and their names thrown around

55:06.600 --> 55:12.680
but miranda keys captain keys all these people they none of them were at all their characters

55:12.680 --> 55:20.280
they were just skin suits here these characters feel much more alive and that i can appreciate

55:20.280 --> 55:25.080
though i do understand arches point for the for the newcomer the person who's never played last

55:25.080 --> 55:31.160
of us and whatnot like it's gonna come across as like hey like why did we have a huge background

55:31.160 --> 55:35.640
story for some family when you could have done this differently because for from arches point

55:35.640 --> 55:39.320
of view what would have been probably better for the newcomer would actually be taking use of

55:39.320 --> 55:44.440
visual storytelling entering the room seeing the dust gathered seeing the pictures on the wall you

55:44.440 --> 55:48.600
can disseminate you know the relationship of these two characters that are dead and they could it

55:48.680 --> 55:52.440
would have been a much shorter and smaller sequence but you could have done it in a

55:52.440 --> 55:56.600
different way i suppose to make it more approachable for newcomers but at the same

55:56.600 --> 56:01.160
time it's a huge section of the game and it's really hard to just walk around it it kind of

56:01.160 --> 56:07.720
had to be touched up on it does feel like this was made specifically for the fans at this point

56:07.720 --> 56:12.680
because they spent so much time on a character that doesn't matter in terms of the actual story

56:12.680 --> 56:20.200
but matters if you played the game it's better than the reverse fan service is better than

56:20.200 --> 56:27.240
ignoring the fans yes that is absolutely correct and again it's still so far has actually proven

56:27.240 --> 56:32.840
to be one of the the better video game adaptations it still lacks in some areas like that the mold

56:32.840 --> 56:40.200
retcon just feels very unnecessary in my opinion unnecessary pointless and just flat out worse

56:40.200 --> 56:44.920
than the original because i don't know i just don't know why they did it because the the tendril

56:44.920 --> 56:51.160
idea of stepping on the spores currently they did it because they wanted to stomp out the last

56:51.160 --> 56:56.680
piece of the check who made it yeah and the thing is i did see at the beginning of the episode well

56:56.680 --> 57:01.400
i did actually like this one quite a bit neil drachman is still executive producer i believe

57:01.400 --> 57:07.400
like the problem with him is he is actively he's he's being a douche like the original girl who

57:07.640 --> 57:13.240
the last of us like made her story about these characters and set it up and it kind of seems

57:13.240 --> 57:19.080
like every time she's done something kind of cool or really interesting he actively is trying to

57:19.080 --> 57:24.760
sabotage her work like in last of us part two with sabotaging ellie's character and basically

57:24.760 --> 57:31.960
fucking her up and making her out to be a terrible person like that's just kind of bad so it feels

57:31.960 --> 57:36.920
like the show is hindered by neil drachman uh in the background honestly if they just lost him

57:37.000 --> 57:41.640
i think the show would probably be doing a lot better how how is it actually doing in terms of

57:41.640 --> 57:47.320
people watching it and like like reviews and stuff what i can't it's actually doing very well it

57:47.320 --> 57:53.960
actually grew its audience after episode one which is very unusual yep because word of mouth that

57:53.960 --> 57:58.200
happened with revenge of the sith when people uh during its launch like people were like i don't

57:58.200 --> 58:02.520
know last two movies are a bit special and people hey it's actually pretty good and then people

58:02.520 --> 58:10.600
started to go see it i'm gonna look for it on uh good old rotten tomatoes tomatoes oh my god jeez

58:11.240 --> 58:17.240
97 tomato meter and 96 audience score i don't know if it's that good maybe people just need

58:17.240 --> 58:23.880
something that's like decent nowadays and they'll just throw they'll throw 90s at it in the modern

58:23.880 --> 58:30.120
world the house of dragons is a masterpiece because it's not complete shit and that's

58:30.120 --> 58:35.560
it's actually tragic because our our standards have lowered quite a bit because everything that's

58:35.560 --> 58:44.200
been coming out our standards have polarized because all we know is garbage or gems that's

58:44.200 --> 58:49.000
actually lowered actually technically i was right i think arch is a bit no you're dumb it's not no

58:49.000 --> 58:55.560
no you're dumb it's not what it means at all our standards have lowered no no no no you're lowered

58:55.560 --> 59:01.880
too you know well if they uh if they keep going with the plot i don't know how many episodes

59:01.880 --> 59:05.960
they're going to be in the season eight episodes ten episodes i'm not sure but if they keep going

59:05.960 --> 59:12.760
with the main plot i mean we're this is about a quarter of the way through the game so i guess

59:12.760 --> 59:18.600
we'll have to see i'll just see how long it takes the value of this episode is going to be apparent

59:19.160 --> 59:26.760
at the end of it because this was an entire episode dedicated to back characters if this

59:26.760 --> 59:31.320
ends up leaving the plot feeling rushed at the end then it will not have been worth it

59:31.960 --> 59:37.400
oh true like if we get to the end of this see this season and we find out that all like it

59:37.400 --> 59:42.280
feels rushed or any way like missing something then that means that this episode actually will

59:42.280 --> 59:47.480
have detracted from the primary plot which is very bad but that's going to have to be found

59:47.480 --> 59:51.560
out later on in the show i guess if they wanted to make a more contemporary show what they could

59:51.560 --> 59:55.080
have done is they could have had them stop at bill's and then bill's place gets overrun and

59:55.080 --> 59:59.720
then bill has to leave with them that's what a normal zombie story would do and then if you

59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.560
wanted flashback later to bill's life after he's become a character that you care about i mean

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.920
i think a normal zombie story would would make a story like that just because you have to have a

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:16.600
reason to care about bill but like like i said before i think the the show just assumes that

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.760
you played the game and so you already care about him yep so you want to know about bill and frank

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.920
for the newcomer if we didn't tell barge about bill and frank well you'd be like who what the

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:31.800
fuck like this whole sequence would make no sense yeah and we also primed him for that fact that

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.360
that's also something to take into consideration the whole episode was spent dealing with them so

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.440
for a newcomer who's never played this before or played the video game they'll be like what

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:47.160
what why are we on this weird side tangent with these two characters that's gonna come out left

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.520
field a little bit for them so that's the end of the of the video oh i guess we should probably

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.880
point out that uh in the middle of the of the recording love love showed up and was like what

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:06.520
the fuck time zones man that's how it is dev's planning don't lie dev it's not just dev's planning

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.160
listen listen no she had to work tonight if we had actually waited for a little if we wouldn't

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:19.960
be starting till about right now that would be way too late for you arch yes yeah so hopefully next

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.320
time she won't have to work nights and she'll be here next time hopefully hopefully i guess that's

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.760
it huh yes that's the end oh i thought you were gonna do like an outro thing well me saying

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:36.760
hopefully is the outro maybe i don't know oh i don't know if i don't know if you've noticed

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.880
but i usually just end my videos whenever i fucking end them i just drop them you lazy little

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.320
town see i feel like you should you know be like all right see you guys you know later or something

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.160
you're just like get out of here all right fine then kibbs here's the outro here it is i'll do

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:59.480
one just for you okay the one episode that you two aren't massively homophobic is the one episode

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.280
that Lilith can't make it i can't believe it ah we'll have to get back to our act then

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:11.960
i've never been afraid of gay people he's like i just hate them
