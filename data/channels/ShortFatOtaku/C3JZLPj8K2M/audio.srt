1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
So, it's just the three of us today, unfortunately. Lilith is AWOL. She's missing. I don't know

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,100
if Lilith got stuck back at work. She does work at like a smoothie store, so sometimes

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,480
you're just like, fuck, you gotta stay late. Shit happens. Who knows? Unfortunately-

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,440
What's a smoothie? The fucking smoothies must be made.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,880
I would like a smoothie actually right now, fuck.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,800
I've never liked smoothies. They're fucking chunky and yucky and whatnot.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Maybe you haven't had a good one. Maybe you haven't had a good one.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Really? You don't like smoothies?

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,280
Like chunky. Like what's chunky smoothie? Normally they're smooth.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,280
Yeah, you really gotta like, you really gotta blend that shit, Arch.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,500
In my country, smoothies are only made by like immigrants working at like minimum wage.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,560
They don't really care. Like there's not even milk in there. Like it stopped being milk

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,520
a week ago. Now it's just like solidified yogurt with some bits of strawberries in it.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,840
I mean, you're supposed to use a little bit of yogurt, like whatever the fuck it's called,

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,520
but like, I think you're smooth. If it's chunky, then they didn't make it right.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,640
Yeah. Also you can just make your own, man. Just get some frozen fruit, get some milk.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
A blender?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Yeah, exactly.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,560
If I'm going to do that, I'm just going to eat the fruit.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,080
But a smoothie, you can drink it. It quenches your thirst and fills the tumpee.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,960
Yeah. And it's cold. You can have it on like a warm day. Wait, you're in Norway. There

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
are no warm days.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
Put me down. Thanks. That's a brilliant idea.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Listen.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Minus 30 or something.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Well, wait.

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
I just minus 30 here too.

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Yeah, it's actually very cold today.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Yeah.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,440
My God, I wish I had something cold to drink.

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Well-

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,440
What are you talking about? Like I go to Dairy Queen in the winter. If I'm driving by, I'm

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,820
like, oh, I want a fucking, one of them little chocolate shaky thingies.

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,180
In any case, in any case, Lilith isn't here. We are unfortunately on a pretty strict timetable,

36
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,180
so we have to go without her. I'm sure she'll be back next week. Hopefully, maybe.

37
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,180
Maybe doesn't even know.

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,580
Before we get started, I do want to point something out. I mentioned last episode, the

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,140
whole race baiting thing didn't really happen so much the same way that it happened with

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,580
Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power or with Obi-Wan Kenobi hasn't really happened

41
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,740
here so much. I did finally find one instance of the race baiting, and it was, of course,

42
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,620
from marysue.com because why fucking wouldn't it be?

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,700
And they say, predictable as always, racists are mad about the new The Last of Us posters

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
and-

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Am I?

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,460
Yeah. Wait, are you the people they're talking about here, Arch? So basically, this article

47
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,580
is trying to make the claim that because Joel's daughter was race swap, which we did

48
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,500
talk about last episode, people are angry and the fans are, this is fan backlash, it's

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,980
fan entitlement and it's all this other nonsense that we've heard a thousand times before.

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,820
However, when you talk about Kenobi or when you talk about the Rings of Power, there's

51
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,180
reasons here that they could have that point of view. They're not very good reasons, but

52
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,260
there's at least reasons. For this though, I haven't seen this at all. It's like they're

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,940
trying to manufacture an outrage and like no one is biting. No one's saying anything

54
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,140
about this shit.

55
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,680
I will defend my dislike of Arrondir to the death.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,540
And even you said that Joel's half black daughter didn't actually matter in the end.

57
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,460
Well, no, not because of their skin color. Like I don't hate Arrondir because he's Puerto

58
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,500
Rican. I hate Arrondir because he can't act.

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,660
Yeah, his acting is stiff. The thing is, if you get an actor, an actress, and they're

60
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,780
not the correct race of a character that they're representing, you can get away with it sometimes

61
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,260
if their performance is so stellar that, hey, they were the best one for the pick. It just

62
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,300
so happened they had the wrong skin.

63
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,180
It's why I actually really enjoyed Disa. Like she's probably one of the best characters

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,700
in the Rings of Power.

65
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,440
That's true. She was. Despite the fact that she wasn't accurate to the lore, she actually

66
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,840
did a stellar performance. And that's honestly all that really matters.

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,920
If they glued a fucking beard onto her, I would have no complaints about her.

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,840
Now that you've mentioned the dwarves, Naomi and I recently watched The Witcher Blood Origins,

69
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,000
which is awful. I don't know if it's even worth doing a video on, but it's so bad.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,120
Maybe I'll do a video on it.

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,800
But like, I did one and it's just, it's my biggest takeaway. Like you could spend a lot

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,620
of time critiquing the storyline, the acting, the presentation, the costumes. There really

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:47,360
is no end. But my biggest complaint is that it manages to make mythical fantasy with a

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,840
high age elven faction, boring and mundane.

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,840
One thing I noticed is that that show didn't do bearded dwarf women either. And I'm like,

76
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,080
hold on a second. Wasn't there a bearded dwarf woman in the main Witcher show? I was

77
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,320
like, what? Why, why didn't you do it in this one? Netflix? What the fuck? But Naomi and

78
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,320
I saw this. We were like, oh, I'm surprised they actually did it because this is the,

79
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,360
this is the kind of thing Hollywood doesn't like to do, even though it would be body positive.

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,800
And then they just didn't do it in, in blood origin. So what the fuck? Why?

81
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Was there, Oh God, see for a moment, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, like Dev must be

82
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,760
why there were no dwarves in that show. And then I remembered that all female dwarf character.

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,460
She's crazy. She was a dwarf. I fucking hated her so much. She, she put like her dead lover's

84
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,280
ashes into her mace and went around killing people. It's so dumb. Cause the worst part

85
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,400
is like, Oh, you killed my, my, um, lesbian lover. We didn't see this. We haven't been

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,080
to like literally the only source we have for this is the clearly insane dwarven. And

87
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,160
this thing too, I didn't even register her as a dwarf because she doesn't look like one.

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,760
She looks like a little person. And since that is all she looks like, they have made

89
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:16,780
no effort to make her look stocky or dwarven in the slightest. And so all I saw was a modern

90
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,800
day little person. It was just Peter Dichlage to me.

91
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,600
What did they call dwarves too? Anyway? Uh, God, okay. Okay. Devil politically correct.

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,520
This word for midgets. Yeah. Arches. My mouth is open there. Cause I can't believe our just

93
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,000
being PC. I was like, whoa, that's what is the politically correct term for midgets. Let's

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,360
see a height challenged people. Oh Jesus. Yeah. When people, uh, if you must refer to

95
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,560
someone by their condition, uh, dwarf dwarfism and little person or LP are acceptable LP.

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:02,720
Yeah. Oh my God. We'll be a little, cause they're a little personal P and midget is

97
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,240
considered derogatory. So there you go. And we got way the fuck off topic. My point was

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,640
just to say, I think we've wandered slightly off topic here. Yeah. Yeah. My point was just

99
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,560
to point out that unlike every other thing that we've seen in, in let's say the past

100
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,800
year, um, this is the one time where the race swapping didn't seem political, didn't seem

101
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,840
to matter, didn't impact anything. And the show is pretty good and yet they're still

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,320
trying to make it into a political issue because that's what get clicks. Well, of course. Um,

103
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:41,560
I actually, I saw an interesting article on this. I don't know if I saved it cause it

104
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,280
was such a pathetic nothing burger. I think, I don't remember where it was, but it wasn't

105
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,440
one of the usual baiting sites, right? Yep. And it was trying so hard to find something

106
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,240
wrong with the last of us and you could tell they were fishing and I'm kind of sitting

107
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,000
here like, why? You're, you're literally just trying to be the contrarian in the room now

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,800
and Hey, I know I get accused of this. Like we get accused. It's like you only watch it

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,480
cause it's bad. I'd prefer it if Obiwan was good. I wanted Obiwan to be good, but it wasn't.

110
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,440
It's fair. A lot of the comments in the last video have been saying like, why are arch

111
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,120
and Kib so negative? I'm so happy that Lilith gives them the Smackdown every now and then

112
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,560
with some positivity. And I'm like, well guys, a little, it's not here today. It's not going

113
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:43,720
to happen. I think, I think like, I think all three of us, not so much Lilith, but all

114
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,440
three of us, we were like in nitpicky mode in the last, in the last video trying to find

115
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,760
the flaws. We were just used to it at this point now, but now I'm like, Oh, it might

116
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,520
actually be good. Well, yeah. I mean, how we did it last time is we were actually looking

117
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,680
at it. We were all going into it with a very negative mindset because to be honest, we've

118
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,600
had a string of terrible shows and it's, it's been exhaustive and it really sort of drains

119
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,440
you. It was actually refreshing that the previous episode, cause we even said in the previous

120
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,880
episode that it was actually not that bad. Listen to what we say, but that's my favorite

121
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:25,280
part. See, I think like of TV that I've seen in the past five years or so, aside from this,

122
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,920
the only thing that's been legitimately good is, uh, the boys is pretty good. Invincible

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,840
was pretty good. Star Wars, Andor was pretty good. And this, and like everything else has

124
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,920
just been raw fucking sewage. I was not fond of Andor. I haven't seen it. So I can't count

125
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,000
it. It's, it's not bad. It's actually not bad. I was pleasantly surprised at how, how,

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,360
you know, not amazing, but serviceable that it was the best parts of Andor would be so

127
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,180
much better if Andor just wasn't there. That's my primary complaint. Like I would love to

128
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:07,720
watch a TV show that goes more into depth about the, the, uh, the empire. Like the whole

129
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,480
prison thing was really interesting. How they run a prison, the whole security detail and

130
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,500
all of that shit. That was really interesting. Uh, even Mon Mothma, although she was the

131
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,560
most modern current year of all the characters was all right and had some cool stuff. And

132
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,840
I loved, uh, uh, uh, Peter, Peter Lindquist, the, the, the smuggler guy, you know, the

133
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,800
guy who was starting the resistance. That was cool shit. I just wish Andor wasn't there.

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,520
Well, don't worry. He dies later. It's okay. I know that. And that was the reason why I

135
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,040
didn't care. Cause I'm like, I know he can't die. He's the, he's the one person in this

136
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,800
show I know has the hand of God watching over him. He said he just died, didn't he? No,

137
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,360
he dies in the future. Cause this is a prequel. Oh, this is dumb. See, there's only six star

138
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:07,280
wars movies. You guys, you guys need to program here. Okay. Should we, now that we've spoken

139
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,080
about every other TV show under the sun, do you want to watch the last of us? If you want

140
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,360
to watch the last of us, I actually kind of do. I'm very curious as to how they're going

141
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,600
to handle the next sequence. Oh, what happens next? I don't remember in the game. That doesn't

142
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
matter. I guess. You know, yeah, that's not spoil it. Cause arch, you're still ignorant

143
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,560
of all this, right? This is all still new to you. He hasn't played the last of us since

144
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,560
we last talked. I don't think let's, uh, let's roll then. Here we go. I'm pressing play.

145
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,840
Oh, there was no intro sequence this time with like some flashback or something. I'm

146
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:46,120
sure we'll get to it now. Bangkok 2022. Don't get the parasites into the river parasites

147
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,920
into your hand, man. That's cheating. You're almost supposed to go one there. Now you're

148
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,780
definitely cheating. Well, you put a little pile of rocks there. You think that's still

149
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:06,600
there after the filming of this, you just go out there and see it, kick it over. Well,

150
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,320
there's I know for a fact, there's an abandoned subway station in Toronto. You can go down,

151
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,240
you can like sneak down there and just see all the shit that various movie crews left

152
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,000
behind because Hollywood goes up there to shoot like subway scenes all the time. Nice.

153
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:33,360
But that's kind of cool. Yeah, it is. What about the sandwich? Yeah. I was about to say,

154
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,360
what about the rest of the chicken sandwich? It didn't eat. It might've been a few days.

155
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:47,400
In the wilderness now. Yeah. So we don't know how long it's been. Don't blame me for something

156
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,080
that isn't my fault. Wow. You are the least lovable forehead I've ever met. You can still

157
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,560
land a plane there though. How did you guys like the thumbnail for the last video? I loved

158
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,600
it. It could have like, you could have enhanced the forehead a little further. I only barely

159
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:14,000
enhanced it. I could, it was how, how little I needed to do was okay. Like I want you to set

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,960
like a plane on it next time that's landed. Like as a man who has a sizable forehead himself,

161
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,680
that thing is enormous. He's like, yeah, I can feel this power from here. People are the real

162
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,280
monsters, sir. Wouldn't you not want to know if that was the case? Kibs, they changed something.

163
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:40,440
I knew about this. Oh, they're driving weren't they? No, Bill and Frank. One of them was supposed

164
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:47,520
to be dead, but that he's alive in this one. So we're going to see both of them. Oh, okay. No,

165
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:55,120
I missed two. It happens more often than you think. Did you suck at shooting or like in general? Damn.

166
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:04,600
Okay. That's kind of cute. I got to grab some stuff. I stashed. Why do you have stuff fast here?

167
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,320
You ask a lot of goddamn questions. So he doesn't have to carry it the next time. He hasn't been out

168
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:19,640
here in a year though. It might not be here. Entirely possible scavengers came by, but how

169
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,640
many scavengers are there and how many scavengers are going to check out a random store? I'm

170
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:37,640
presumably she hid it. Mortal Kombat 2. These lines would be better if it wasn't delivered by

171
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,840
her. Like I cannot help, but she's just not the right character for this. I actually don't mind

172
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,960
the snark between them. Oh no, I like the snark. I just don't like her delivery of it. Because the

173
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,920
snark is definitely the thing that really did make the interactions of the video game. Made them

174
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:09,240
endearing. Now I'd be scared personally. Don't fall in. Yeah, don't check with your flashlight

175
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:18,440
down there first or anything. Oh, thank you. I expect something. Yeah, I wouldn't do that. I'm

176
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:26,000
sorry. I'm a fucking pussy. I ain't going down for a minute. This is all new, isn't it? Where's

177
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,840
the jump scare? I'm expecting it. It's too tense. It's gonna be here. Ah, she will reach for it.

178
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:42,600
Don't do this to me, Cho. I don't like jump scares. It's gonna happen, Kibbs.

179
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:51,240
There it is. It wasn't gonna be a jump scare? They were actually gonna be building like...

180
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:59,800
Oh, he's sad. He's like, help, I'm stuck. Oh no. Now I'm surprised that he's not dead,

181
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,000
because these aren't like zombies, you know? They're not dead that have been reanimated.

182
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,680
They're still living things. Surely being crushed for this long would kill you. It might have

183
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,040
happened recently. I mean, it had to have, because he hasn't fully turned, his eyes aren't fully

184
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,160
covered. I just want to see you like start picking pieces of the mushroom off her. Jesus, what are you

185
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,200
doing? That's pretty gross. Now, don't be a fucking monster. Like, just put them down.

186
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,800
Yeah, actually, I don't mind that, because she's curious. Like, okay, what's actually inside of

187
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,320
you, etc. It's like, wow, I let my hyper important cargo that I killed my fucking girlfriend for just

188
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:49,320
kind of wander away. I mean, to his knowledge, she was only in that other room. No, you think

189
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,120
he would have reacted to the clank sound, or the dragging sound, or the thumping sound.

190
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,920
That gun's way too big for her. This is kind of stupid, though. Unless he's coming back for that

191
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,280
thing fairly soon, that's not going to be fireable by the time he gets back. Yep, his plan is to

192
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,480
return. That plane is remarkably intact, considering what happened to it. And how it landed, too.

193
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,800
Pilot didn't do too bad. There probably was survivors. So, the tainted food all hits the

194
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,640
store shelves around the same time Thursday. People bought it, ate some Thursday night or

195
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:42,120
Friday morning. The day goes on. They started to get sick. Afternoon, evening, they got worse.

196
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,440
I think this is all new. Then they started biting. Yeah, this is not a very good explanation,

197
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,800
because food goes through a whole fucking hell of a lot of sterilization procedures and shit.

198
00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:00,840
Like, you wouldn't just get fungus in there on a national scale. Not only national, because of

199
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,360
different plants around the world, but it would only be a local area that would be actually

200
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,480
affected. And it would be soon. Flower Made in America isn't really flown to, like, everywhere.

201
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,280
This would have to hit, like, every single source of a food supply and then be distributed across

202
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,760
the globe. At the same time. Yeah, I know. Like, some grain reaches certain bakeries before other

203
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,280
bakeries. They bake the food a day or a few days earlier. Hey, listen, this show turns out to be

204
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,400
pretty basic. It's anti-globalist, anti-supply chain. Anti-government, too. Again, the only

205
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,920
real complaint I have about this show so far is the whole change to the mushrooms is just a bad

206
00:18:42,920 --> 00:19:06,200
change. This is another thing, too. I don't know if this was in the game, but I don't think that

207
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,760
would happen because it's going to be very difficult to get soldiers to cold-heartedly

208
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,440
gun down civilians because there wasn't room at the fucking hospital. Yes, getting a soldier to

209
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,040
start gunning down civilians, especially these civilians are fellow countrymen, is not easy.

210
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:33,880
Some people easily will do it. It's like your families. Here's the flashback. Yeah.

211
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:41,960
The thing is, that's the thing. Soldiers aren't mindless fucking

212
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,560
trolls. This is Hollywood we're talking about here, aren't you?

213
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Hollywood is kind of anti-army, usually. Hollywood thinks that the military and the

214
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,200
police are just these crypto-fascists waiting for orders from whoever happens to hold the

215
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:11,880
reins of power. And they'll gun down whoever the fuck... Oh, yeah, so Bill and Frank,

216
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:24,280
they were like the libertarians, eh? Yeah. Yeah, Bill... I think it was Bill who was the

217
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,920
hardcore libertarian who was just like, I've been waiting for so fucking long for the world

218
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,440
to collapse so I can live out here in peace. But he didn't live in a forest, he lived in a suburb.

219
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,360
He's a base man. What a bossin.

220
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,960
He's a collector. That's a selection. Yep. I like he's got Waterloo, the great weasel of lies down

221
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,040
there. Oh my god, look, he put on a gas mask. How hard was it for him? Now that's an actor I

222
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:58,280
respect already. Look at that. I think I know who this guy is, so I get recognized his voice.

223
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,160
In fact, he's willing to wear a gas mask. This fucking guy.

224
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I don't think I would have chosen the shotgun to go out hunting the feds, but... Basically,

225
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,320
the feds came through, evacuated everyone, and if you couldn't go, they killed you. He smiled. Oh,

226
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,960
it is? It's the fucking guy from... Oh god, what's that show? Oh fuck, I can't remember.

227
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm actually glad they picked him, though. He's gonna go fishing.

228
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,760
Might as well. Might as well.

229
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,920
This must be heaven for him. I mean, the power's still on, so you might as well...

230
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,520
Yep, it's gonna be off soon. Yeah. That was fast. That was fast,

231
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,200
unironically. Only lasted a day. All my commenters were saying that the feds couldn't shut off their

232
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,920
gas stoves. Yes, they fucking could. He had to turn it back on. I like this scene a lot.

233
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,920
The doomsday prepper gets what he wants. Yep. There's gonna be some traps.

234
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,400
I actually really appreciate these flashback scenes when it's like this.

235
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,440
Showing us the characters before. I didn't appreciate the previous ones,

236
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,640
but this one's nice. The previous one was bad, but this one... He's growing veggies.

237
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:19,160
He's got chickens. Yeah, man. He's gonna be living a good life. Yeah. I want to point out that

238
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,280
everyone that's in the federal camps are starving to death right now, or having food shortages.

239
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,840
This guy's living the time of his life. It's gonna get a little lonely, though.

240
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,720
No, he turned back on the electricity, or is that the generator? What did he do at the gas plant?

241
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,600
He turned back on the natural gas to the city. You would have thought that this guy like this

242
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,080
would have an independent gas supply, like, you know, the gas canisters in the stove.

243
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,400
But here comes a zombie.

244
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,960
The show is growing on me more. Oh, he's like turned the suburb into a...

245
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,680
He's like built a gate and all this shit. Damn. Yep. Don't tread on me.

246
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,200
Oh, my God. I think he has a Windows XP computer.

247
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,120
Looks like it. Well, if you don't want your shit to crash.

248
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:31,320
I mean, I just like the attention to detail. That's great. Baltimore QZ. It's gone.

249
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,400
Damn. You're hurt. How did he fall into the hole?

250
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,360
He was down. He camouflaged it with a fucking chicken net. That thing would be hard to see.

251
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,800
He's how the hell did he get one of the federal scanners?

252
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,880
He probably just killed some of them while they were out.

253
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,000
They might have left him in some areas.

254
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,840
And every bum you talk to about it is going to show up here looking for a free lunch.

255
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,160
And this is not an Arby's.

256
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,840
Free lunch was a restaurant.

257
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,120
I mean, after four years, the isolation is bound to be getting at him.

258
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,920
Yeah. In fact, I'm kind of shocked that he hasn't gone literally insane yet.

259
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,280
I just noticed that this guy is Ron Swanson. Jesus.

260
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Yes. That's why I'm so glad they got him. He played Ron Swanson.

261
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,640
It's like the same character.

262
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,720
Yep. This is a stellar pick, by the way.

263
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,920
Well, I wish you were hot blonde, but I guess you'll have to do.

264
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,440
What? What just happened?

265
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,600
I'm just looking around and he's suspicious.

266
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
He's so happy.

267
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,320
It's like, yeah, that is the correct response, though,

268
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,440
considering what he's probably been so used to is.

269
00:24:59,400 --> 00:24:59,960
You're welcome.

270
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, this is a heartwarming scene, you know.

271
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,080
It is so I guess I'll be going on.

272
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,580
This is you.

273
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,960
He's reading them like a book.

274
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,600
Yeah. Oh, my God.

275
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,200
It's my favorite.

276
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,960
He's like, I'm a musician. I'm valuable.

277
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,720
I can raise morale.

278
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
It's been a little bit. Give me a break.

279
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Oh, sure. How long since that piano was?

280
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,080
Oh, no, they're going to get tangled.

281
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,560
So he's going to be alive now.

282
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,480
Yeah, because in the original game, he was dead.

283
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,200
And that's why it was super abrasive, if I'm right, or was it drunk?

284
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,600
I can't remember something like a weird or about him because he was gone.

285
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,480
So, wait, Arch, how how did your gaydar go off on this?

286
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,440
Quite a while ago, honestly.

287
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,040
No, it's it's obvious.

288
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,120
Even if you don't know, this was charged for quite a while now.

289
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,360
So it wasn't spoiled for you?

290
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,960
No, because for me, it's like I was sitting there thinking like,

291
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,400
this is probably going to be the gay scene.

292
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,680
See? Well, this isn't anything new because this is how it was in the original game.

293
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,080
So it's not always a thing.

294
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,040
But this is more like an origin story to how I will say it was a little bit forced.

295
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,800
Like this was I don't know, like I didn't mind this.

296
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,640
This is actually decent because they're in the apocalypse.

297
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,240
Like the guy's been lonely for four years.

298
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,560
They're they're both nervous.

299
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:09,320
But this guy, the guy on the bed, he comes across as a little bit too seductory.

300
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,840
You have the other guy.

301
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,000
The other guy's doing a better job.

302
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,680
It doesn't like actually, I think this guy is doing a better job because he's.

303
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,120
I like him a lot as an actor.

304
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,520
Because they're the guy on the bed.

305
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,960
He comes across as way too suave for this.

306
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,080
Like, wait, no, I don't want a sex scene, though.

307
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,600
Like the romance is fine.

308
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,040
No, Kim's got to watch it.

309
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,720
No, it feels a pinch forced.

310
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,240
I feel like instead of a scene, this should be their relationship after a week

311
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,520
or a month or two.

312
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,280
But I guess time constraints.

313
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,360
So, man, see, I like everything except for like, I don't like I don't need to watch.

314
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,920
I have sex for lunches.

315
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,360
That's fair, even great ones.

316
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,160
Come on, that was at least a dinner.

317
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,760
It's a bit cheap.

318
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,760
I didn't really pick up on anything gay until the piano.

319
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Even though I knew that they were gay because the game.

320
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,240
But like, still, I had pent up on the gay around the shower scene.

321
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,840
Oh, the shower scene, the shower scene, because he acted very giddy, like nervous around it.

322
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,800
Like he was in the shower.

323
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,880
He was like, Oh, my God, you're in the shower.

324
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,680
Yeah, oh, come on.

325
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,720
Hey, would you stop?

326
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,440
I like that.

327
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,600
It wasn't actually just a sex scene noise.

328
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,440
You live in a psycho bunker where 9-11 was an inside job and the government are all Nazis.

329
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
The government are all Nazis.

330
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,960
OK, hold on a second.

331
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,960
I'll pause there for a second.

332
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,840
I need to tweet.

333
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,840
That's brilliant.

334
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,400
I love it.

335
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,080
Oh, man, this might be my favorite episode yet.

336
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,800
Yeah, this is pretty good.

337
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,240
You know, it's actually kind of refreshing.

338
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,960
And you know what?

339
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,240
For an HBO show, I was worried they were going to go the gross path where it's like,

340
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,120
pep.

341
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,960
And I was like, oh, but they actually just like they cut to black.

342
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,640
They cut or they did not cut back.

343
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,960
They cut the screen before anything started.

344
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,800
And that's good, because the important part about the show is you to tell the story

345
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,920
and narrative elements and the relationships between the two characters.

346
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,400
You don't need to focus on the non-essentials.

347
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,320
The flat flaps the groups.

348
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,400
You have it, kids, you're out here getting your cheeks plapped all the time.

349
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,480
Listen, that's for money.

350
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,360
That's a different again.

351
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,040
this it was a little bit too obvious in my opinion because the other guy came across as overtly

352
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,360
sexual quite early on and he he comes across as way too much of a seductress i don't see it at all

353
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,880
i mean it's just me i like bill zach what the fuck's his name he's he's fucking stellar i i

354
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,120
think it's absolutely hilarious how bill does the whole 9 11 truth of the government are all nazis

355
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,320
and it turns out he was right but there's like a weird left right overlap here

356
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,680
where you have like the libertarians who sometimes say the exact same thing as the socialists

357
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,880
about government well in this universe the the government basically was too

358
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,560
too super controlling didn't relinquish power are you are you pissing there kibbs jesus

359
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,760
oh sorry i was pouring myself some tea oh okay listen your mic's all fixed now your mic's fixed

360
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,400
we can hear that at this point oh damn that picked that up yeah i was pouring myself some more tea

361
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,200
i wasn't peeing into the cup i swear

362
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,120
but uh yeah i actually think that's pretty cool also they chose the best actor to play bill

363
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,240
yeah they did they should have done like he meets him he picks him up and they kind of like okay

364
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,280
you can say you can stay the night and then like three days later then you do the piano scene or

365
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,040
something yeah i would have liked this to be a little bit less starstruck romance but i'm gayer

366
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:18,040
than you fixing up some of the shops yes bill is the more masculine ones are we hosting formal

367
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:28,920
garden parties now no there might be but we are gonna have friends excuse me he wants to build a

368
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,120
town yep he wants to build the community i've actually been talking to a nice woman on the radio

369
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,400
you what that's not gonna be fucking happy

370
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,280
right this is that that is actually extraordinarily stupid okay we have all of these resources here

371
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,720
uh would you like to uh come on over and sample some of them i'm the same way this is how they

372
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,960
met i'm not schizophrenic he's gonna pull out the gun he has under the table which i get by the way

373
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,680
how nice this is to have a civilized meal in such a beautiful place

374
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,680
he doesn't oh that's disappointing i mean that's way more fun we don't end up working together

375
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,520
they made both of them look a lot younger working together

376
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,920
the actors and actresses i mean like they are younger in the in the story but like

377
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,680
they really de-age them nicely with makeup or age them up with makeup in the present whatever

378
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:28,200
i want to show you something not inside frank frank

379
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
bill's mad yep

380
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:47,320
i understand i still want him to be holding a gun under the table he'll come at night quiet and armed

381
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,880
that is true i mean this place screams easy pickings

382
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,360
yeah you need more people here you need a little town not just the two of you

383
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:09,000
more manpower would be useful for defense yeah those traps in that fence is not going

384
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,440
to be an obstacle to people with tools well organized hungry looking for resources

385
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:25,160
um well they put a bunch of fucking cars he's fortified a bit like i can't

386
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,920
just one more loop around i got something to show you huh not that

387
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,520
oh

388
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,160
he got excited

389
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,520
it's radishes it looks like strawberries

390
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,160
a little one a little one

391
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,840
i expected it to be more pissed about that and yeah they were strawberries you thought

392
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,840
they were radishes it's close to these strawberry bushes yummy strawberry they're very tiny

393
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,360
strawberry not natural strawberries by the way those are modern day bio-engineered berries yeah

394
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:23,320
chunky at my uh girlfriend's childhood home they have strawberry bushes in the back and

395
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:30,280
they're much bigger bushes with much smaller berries yes those are modern day strawberries

396
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,040
this episode has actually been pretty good at building these two characters up yep

397
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:44,600
so

398
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,840
yeah no this is actually probably the single best gay romance i think i've ever seen

399
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,800
i'm quite enjoying this

400
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:58,200
a rain catcher uh-oh stormy night that means shit's about to go down boys prepare for some

401
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:08,920
tragedy they're ready okay that's more than a little stereotypical but

402
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:21,240
flame throwers yes i was about to say like holy fuck hey you gotta wake up dude it's time

403
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,280
oh shit

404
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,400
he's just taking him out yep bill's already out there

405
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:54,440
he's going to help yep the woman has armed herself with a ppk and it's going to come help

406
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,200
dude just stay in the house

407
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,760
he's just in the middle of the fucking street

408
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,680
get inside he's gonna yeah i was about to say he's gonna get him killed

409
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,520
we gotta get you inside no no to be fair it was bloody retarded for him to stand in the

410
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:36,120
middle of the street fucking illuminated by the fire okay i think it's time for the bandits to

411
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:44,680
call it quits that's a lot of casualties yep he'll take care of you

412
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:54,680
you lied to me dev i lied to you

413
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,520
he died

414
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,720
oh definitely looks like he died

415
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,120
yeah there's no way because bill's the one that survives out of the two in the game

416
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:20,040
oh thank god there's no wheelchair now oh damn they're a little old oh no the other one's in a

417
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,760
wheelchair okay oh no uh so you just kind of skipped over the whole recovery period he's just

418
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,400
he's he's fine now bill's the one recovered the other guys in the wheelchair dead not good

419
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:43,400
i mean 10 years you can recover in 10 years yeah but i i would have liked to seen it rather than

420
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,400
just like yeah he was fine damn they did a better job of aging these guys up than the obi-wan show

421
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:54,840
did aging anakin down yeah did you see that somebody used a snapchat filter and did a better

422
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,240
job yeah that was sad so he must be ill or something

423
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,160
yeah that looks like some sort of

424
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,840
what is it where joe biden can't draw a clock what's that called again

425
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:21,000
he's having a hard time eating yeah yeah i i don't necessarily think this is illness i think this is

426
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,520
old because that's a pretty good painting everything is it i know he's a prepper but

427
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,640
he should have spent the past 20 years building a little town rather than just living like this you

428
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,960
know if they had a community that would probably would have made them stronger in the end but yeah

429
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:44,280
yep now they're gonna die alone sad and childless i should have taken a little child orphan that

430
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,880
wandered by the fence that didn't blow up yeah that didn't get the shotgun or something like

431
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,600
oh look this one's alive i want to keep it i want to keep a little suicide on top at all just to

432
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,960
make it extra sad what if what if someone he shows up there wasn't anything to cure this before the

433
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,720
world fell apart oh this is cancer oh he's terminal you'll wear what i ask

434
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:17,240
who will get married it's time for drag queen story hour you cook a delicious dinner

435
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,880
and then i'm going to take all of these

436
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,880
he pranted flowers

437
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,560
where did they get the paint from they could probably make it also entirely popularly it

438
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,760
was dried paint and all they do is moisturize it home depot traded for it anything

439
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,400
in the eyes of god you're still degenerates

440
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,800
damn it's true though yeah it's true though i mean marriage is more of a christian thing anyways

441
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:17,160
i know filthy christian i'm a heathen i am when it suits me fair enough rabbits like their first

442
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:25,720
meeting i guess nice touch a lot of this is unique to the show they didn't go into nearly

443
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,840
as much detail yeah now the problem with crushing pills and your alcohol is that it's gonna taste

444
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:37,480
like ass afterwards yeah that's why you should just be a man and gulp them down immediately

445
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,440
well now they're gonna do it here comes the meal first

446
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,720
okay i gotta point out they've still got a wine left after like 20 30 years he must have had

447
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,920
quite the fucking stock well also the wine store remember yeah true but even a wine store there's

448
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,960
yeah true but even a wine store there's a limit to how much wine is in that store

449
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,880
i don't think they're drinking wine every day probably only special occasions you know

450
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,280
savoring it yeah that's gonna taste fucking awful you barely stirred it

451
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,200
like the spoon my wine is gonna taste awful

452
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:29,000
oh damn that would be so hard to do you guys better get in bed quick might be fast acting

453
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,120
sleeping meds it should take a while

454
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,280
but from an objective point of view

455
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:47,880
it's incredibly romantic damn yeah that's how you know she's not a woman

456
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,240
because otherwise she'd be mad right now she'd be menstruating violently

457
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:05,640
and now will joel and uh forehead come about and find them dead in their each other's arms in bed

458
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,560
so you're telling me dev lied extra hard they both died anyways well uh i did

459
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,160
now this is actually very very different i don't know if you recall kibbs but in the game

460
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:26,760
if you found all the logs um these two had a fight frank had run away from bill and died

461
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,920
somewhere out there and then you bring the news back to bill and bill is pissed about it

462
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:41,560
and he but also frank left a note basically saying you fucking destroyed my life i hate

463
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:49,960
you you ruined everything i'm glad to be free of you it's like it's jesus it's it's not a happy

464
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:57,640
ending i think i prefer this one this this one is more sad that one was more like damn

465
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,200
damn they still have gas for their generator after all these years

466
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,520
like i'm sorry my gas will have turned to fucking jello by this time oh power so long stay there

467
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,640
this is probably the next day or something still here the generator too

468
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,800
like at least turn it off at the end

469
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,200
i feel like they've got better things to worry about i'm sorry frank i'm just gonna have to

470
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,880
go outside and turn off the generator real quick before we die in our each other's arms

471
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,480
now that's what i call a fire hazard yeah you guys should put the candles too

472
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:42,280
the lights are still on yeah this is literally the next day yeah there's a heavy pattern of dust

473
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:49,640
on the thing maybe not yeah because that or is there or is it just the sun on the table it's

474
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:56,520
kind of yeah i see i see i'm not sure no maybe not no i think it might actually be just the

475
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,760
next day or no it's no no it's definitely all the next day no it's been a little bit yeah

476
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,320
yeah yeah you can see it clearly there the dust it's been a couple weeks maybe

477
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,560
something like that oh god your wide googly eyes not enormous forehead triggers me so

478
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:16,940
hello

479
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,600
it's quite the forehead though you can admire its power

480
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,360
hey joel here's the keys to the castle

481
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,720
oh she went outside what the fuck

482
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,120
yeah joel you really should keep a closer eye on that no well there she is i was just

483
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:51,000
windowing fuck bev to whomever but probably joe i figured i fell under whomever

484
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:59,960
him was this so he's dead now no that's kind of lame i was gonna be accidentally survived

485
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,760
they poisoned each other yeah somebody fucked up the dosage and lived so they're dead 2023

486
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,400
the last gay person on earth passed away if you find this please do not come into the bedroom

487
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,280
we left the window open so the house wouldn't smell it will probably be a sight i'm guessing

488
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,160
you found this joel because anyone else would have been electrocuted or blown up by one of my traps

489
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:33,240
at least he's a sick bastard the bunker code is the same as the gate code but in reverse

490
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,360
anyway i never liked you but still it's like we're friends almost

491
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,440
and they kept a bit of that spirit in there if i never liked you

492
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,640

506
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:17,080
town out here holy shit this is still a fully stocked place this guy was a genius

507

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,480
oh listen toilet paper toiletries are a pleasantry

00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,720
five they haven't like the amount of shit this dude must have looted to last all these years

512
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,280
he had a whole town to loot yeah but even that's not that much shit

513
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,680
i'm taking a shower and then you're showering seriously damn

514
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:12,120
oh women fuck oh yeah just close it don't worry about that i mean the people here are dead but at

515
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,160
the same time god yeah i guess i'm the only one thinking about the future because i'm i'm really

516
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,840
like okay you know what they should do turn off everything when they leave like lock this place

517
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,720
up maybe it's useful in the future ah the woman gun

518
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,040
the night don't fuck i thought she was gonna look down the

519
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,760
the gun goes off in her backpack from throwing it around

520
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,640
and then an iconic rear view shot as they drive out the gate forgetting to turn off the generator

521
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,880
and all of the other valuable stuff there yep as the volume increases

522
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,040
yep and it stops being a radio broadcast it becomes actually a soundtrack

523
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,440
come on do the iconic rear view shot as they leave the game don't disappoint me baby

524
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,200
tv show whatever the fuck you are

525
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,600
i'm still gonna say bill died though i want to see how bill would talk to people

526
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:21,400
oh i'll take it i'll take it from the open window

527
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,360
camera the last rancid shot of the fucking desiccated skeletons

528
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,240
that's a little unnecessary don't do that

529
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:44,360
i think i'm gonna love you tasteful just the way i like it wow that was a surprisingly tasteful

530
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:53,240
episode yeah i didn't go too far i will say it feels like a bit of a fucking waste but what do

531
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,200
you mean look at this little pessimistic poly there was there was no actual story progression here

532
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,440
pretty much it was more of a thing for the uh people who played the video games to appreciate

533
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,400
these characters it also sets up that in this world despite all the tragedies despite all the

534
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,000
hardships and all the horrors that there were people that still were able to have find happiness

535
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,880
in life well it's not just that it is that but it's also the fact that if they were gonna include

536
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,440
like just these levels from the game they had to they had to flesh them out right because i don't

537
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,800
know if you recall the area around bill's place kibbs but there was a bunch of just like fetch

538
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,040
quests and you're going through like through a suburb and you're just finding stuff for bill

539
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,480
and he's like listen i'll help you out but you gotta do something for me go find this and it's

540
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:45,320
like it's it's video gamey right so they had if they're gonna put him in and put his story in

541
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,960
they had to do something different with it yep instead of it being a fetch quest which honestly

542
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,240
is a better way to wrap up his section of the thing and for people who played the video game

543
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,280
it actually adds quite a bit because it adds a lot more insight based on the notes about you know his

544
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:07,000
life that changed the more dark ending where frank just sort of fucks off and dies yeah

545
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,200
they changed the part where uh yeah they're actually estranged lovers and

546
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,800
frank dies and bill just cries about it in his house as you drive away

547
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,320
once upon a time i had somebody that i cared about

548
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,200
partner somebody i had to look after

549
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:31,720
and in this world that sort of shit's good for one thing getting you killed so you know what it

550
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:37,880
did why isn't the fuck up and i realized it's got to be just me bill today it ain't like that

551
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,080
it's bullshit it is just like that jesus

552
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,160
what do you know this guy or something

553
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,080
frank who the hell's frank he was my partner

554
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,960
he's the only idiot that would wear a shirt like that

555
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,960
he's got bites here and

556
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,720
here

557
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:27,400
i reckon he didn't want to turn so yeah i guess not

558
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:41,720
well fuck him that's my battery that fucking asshole jesus that's more of my stuff

559
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:54,600
so what you just just gonna steal my shit and run off is that it frank bill i uh

560
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,760
i found this in there and i uh i figured you should have it

561
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,160
and that's how you feel well fuck you too frank

562
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,680
fucking idiot you ready to go

563
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:20,200
you think well it's a bit more awkward but yes that's true it was a bit more tasteful and they

564
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,920
did it very tasteful too like when it came to the sex scenes they didn't they didn't make it weird

565
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,600
like a lot of hbo shows do and they also didn't do that thing where they could show the window

566
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:36,280
and show the corpses there be like look it's gritty like okay thank you kind of sour the

567
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,000
moment they understood that uh it had a very pleasant feel the whole episode

568
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,720
now what's the next part of the game kibbs you recall uh my memory's all screwed up i'm gonna

569
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,040
play last of us one like once and the problem is every time i'm thinking about the last of us i

570
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,040
keep i can't unsee the last of us part two sections i also keep mixing up with like the

571
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,440
early storylines of the walking dead because it's very similar the next bit is where they get

572
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:09,640
ambushed in pittsburgh remember that kibbs that there's that famous scene yeah he's like

573
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:16,600
he's not even injured and just like runs him over that's gonna that's gonna be great okay so i know

574
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,280
where we are in the plot now okay i'm still just not at all hooked into this show if anything if

575
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:27,800
there is any weakness to this show it is that for somebody who like me who doesn't have nostalgia

576
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:35,160
goggles for the show i'm not i'm just not interested well this was a this was a nice

577
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,400
gay romance and it's one of the most uh tasteful ones i think i've ever seen

578
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,960
but i was like i don't know these people it's it's more of a show written for what feels like

579
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:53,000
the people who played the video game and honestly yeah i'll take that i'll take that over what we

580
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,040
got with the halo show where it was meant for the general audience and not the halo fans

581
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,880
because that was the biggest fucking thing with the halo tv show that made it so bad

582
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,600
it had nothing to do with halo it had halo characters and their names thrown around

583
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:12,680
but miranda keys captain keys all these people they none of them were at all their characters

584
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:20,280
they were just skin suits here these characters feel much more alive and that i can appreciate

585
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,080
though i do understand arches point for the for the newcomer the person who's never played last

586
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:31,160
of us and whatnot like it's gonna come across as like hey like why did we have a huge background

587
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,640
story for some family when you could have done this differently because for from arches point

588
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,320
of view what would have been probably better for the newcomer would actually be taking use of

589
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:44,440
visual storytelling entering the room seeing the dust gathered seeing the pictures on the wall you

590
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,600
can disseminate you know the relationship of these two characters that are dead and they could it

591
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,440
would have been a much shorter and smaller sequence but you could have done it in a

592
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,600
different way i suppose to make it more approachable for newcomers but at the same

593
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,160
time it's a huge section of the game and it's really hard to just walk around it it kind of

594
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:07,720
had to be touched up on it does feel like this was made specifically for the fans at this point

595
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,680
because they spent so much time on a character that doesn't matter in terms of the actual story

596
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:20,200
but matters if you played the game it's better than the reverse fan service is better than

597
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:27,240
ignoring the fans yes that is absolutely correct and again it's still so far has actually proven

598
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:32,840
to be one of the the better video game adaptations it still lacks in some areas like that the mold

599
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:40,200
retcon just feels very unnecessary in my opinion unnecessary pointless and just flat out worse

600
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,920
than the original because i don't know i just don't know why they did it because the the tendril

601
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:51,160
idea of stepping on the spores currently they did it because they wanted to stomp out the last

602
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,680
piece of the check who made it yeah and the thing is i did see at the beginning of the episode well

603
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,400
i did actually like this one quite a bit neil drachman is still executive producer i believe

604
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,400
like the problem with him is he is actively he's he's being a douche like the original girl who

605
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:13,240
the last of us like made her story about these characters and set it up and it kind of seems

606
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:19,080
like every time she's done something kind of cool or really interesting he actively is trying to

607
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:24,760
sabotage her work like in last of us part two with sabotaging ellie's character and basically

608
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:31,960
fucking her up and making her out to be a terrible person like that's just kind of bad so it feels

609
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,920
like the show is hindered by neil drachman uh in the background honestly if they just lost him

610
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,640
i think the show would probably be doing a lot better how how is it actually doing in terms of

611
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:47,320
people watching it and like like reviews and stuff what i can't it's actually doing very well it

612
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:53,960
actually grew its audience after episode one which is very unusual yep because word of mouth that

613
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,200
happened with revenge of the sith when people uh during its launch like people were like i don't

614
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,520
know last two movies are a bit special and people hey it's actually pretty good and then people

615
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:10,600
started to go see it i'm gonna look for it on uh good old rotten tomatoes tomatoes oh my god jeez

616
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:17,240
97 tomato meter and 96 audience score i don't know if it's that good maybe people just need

617
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:23,880
something that's like decent nowadays and they'll just throw they'll throw 90s at it in the modern

618
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,120
world the house of dragons is a masterpiece because it's not complete shit and that's

619
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,560
it's actually tragic because our our standards have lowered quite a bit because everything that's

620
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:44,200
been coming out our standards have polarized because all we know is garbage or gems that's

621
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,000
actually lowered actually technically i was right i think arch is a bit no you're dumb it's not no

622
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,560
no you're dumb it's not what it means at all our standards have lowered no no no no you're lowered

623
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:01,880
too you know well if they uh if they keep going with the plot i don't know how many episodes

624
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,960
they're going to be in the season eight episodes ten episodes i'm not sure but if they keep going

625
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:12,760
with the main plot i mean we're this is about a quarter of the way through the game so i guess

626
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,600
we'll have to see i'll just see how long it takes the value of this episode is going to be apparent

627
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:26,760
at the end of it because this was an entire episode dedicated to back characters if this

628
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,320
ends up leaving the plot feeling rushed at the end then it will not have been worth it

629
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,400
oh true like if we get to the end of this see this season and we find out that all like it

630
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,280
feels rushed or any way like missing something then that means that this episode actually will

631
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,480
have detracted from the primary plot which is very bad but that's going to have to be found

632
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,560
out later on in the show i guess if they wanted to make a more contemporary show what they could

633
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,080
have done is they could have had them stop at bill's and then bill's place gets overrun and

634
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,720
then bill has to leave with them that's what a normal zombie story would do and then if you

635
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:05,560
wanted flashback later to bill's life after he's become a character that you care about i mean

636
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,920
i think a normal zombie story would would make a story like that just because you have to have a

637
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,600
reason to care about bill but like like i said before i think the the show just assumes that

638
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,760
you played the game and so you already care about him yep so you want to know about bill and frank

639
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,920
for the newcomer if we didn't tell barge about bill and frank well you'd be like who what the

640
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:31,800
fuck like this whole sequence would make no sense yeah and we also primed him for that fact that

641
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,360
that's also something to take into consideration the whole episode was spent dealing with them so

642
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,440
for a newcomer who's never played this before or played the video game they'll be like what

643
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:47,160
what why are we on this weird side tangent with these two characters that's gonna come out left

644
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:52,520
field a little bit for them so that's the end of the of the video oh i guess we should probably

645
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,880
point out that uh in the middle of the of the recording love love showed up and was like what

646
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:06,520
the fuck time zones man that's how it is dev's planning don't lie dev it's not just dev's planning

647
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:11,160
listen listen no she had to work tonight if we had actually waited for a little if we wouldn't

648
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:19,960
be starting till about right now that would be way too late for you arch yes yeah so hopefully next

649
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,320
time she won't have to work nights and she'll be here next time hopefully hopefully i guess that's

650
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,760
it huh yes that's the end oh i thought you were gonna do like an outro thing well me saying

651
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,760
hopefully is the outro maybe i don't know oh i don't know if i don't know if you've noticed

652
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,880
but i usually just end my videos whenever i fucking end them i just drop them you lazy little

653
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:47,320
