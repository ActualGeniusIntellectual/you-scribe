{"text": " So, it's just the three of us today, unfortunately. Lilith is AWOL. She's missing. I don't know if Lilith got stuck back at work. She does work at like a smoothie store, so sometimes you're just like, fuck, you gotta stay late. Shit happens. Who knows? Unfortunately- What's a smoothie? The fucking smoothies must be made. Yeah. I would like a smoothie actually right now, fuck. I've never liked smoothies. They're fucking chunky and yucky and whatnot. Maybe you haven't had a good one. Maybe you haven't had a good one. Really? You don't like smoothies? Like chunky. Like what's chunky smoothie? Normally they're smooth. Yeah, you really gotta like, you really gotta blend that shit, Arch. In my country, smoothies are only made by like immigrants working at like minimum wage. They don't really care. Like there's not even milk in there. Like it stopped being milk a week ago. Now it's just like solidified yogurt with some bits of strawberries in it. I mean, you're supposed to use a little bit of yogurt, like whatever the fuck it's called, but like, I think you're smooth. If it's chunky, then they didn't make it right. Yeah. Also you can just make your own, man. Just get some frozen fruit, get some milk. A blender? Yeah, exactly. If I'm going to do that, I'm just going to eat the fruit. But a smoothie, you can drink it. It quenches your thirst and fills the tumpee. Yeah. And it's cold. You can have it on like a warm day. Wait, you're in Norway. There are no warm days. Put me down. Thanks. That's a brilliant idea. Listen. Minus 30 or something. Well, wait. I just minus 30 here too. Yeah, it's actually very cold today. Yeah. My God, I wish I had something cold to drink. Well- What are you talking about? Like I go to Dairy Queen in the winter. If I'm driving by, I'm like, oh, I want a fucking, one of them little chocolate shaky thingies. In any case, in any case, Lilith isn't here. We are unfortunately on a pretty strict timetable, so we have to go without her. I'm sure she'll be back next week. Hopefully, maybe. Maybe doesn't even know. Before we get started, I do want to point something out. I mentioned last episode, the whole race baiting thing didn't really happen so much the same way that it happened with Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power or with Obi-Wan Kenobi hasn't really happened here so much. I did finally find one instance of the race baiting, and it was, of course, from marysue.com because why fucking wouldn't it be? And they say, predictable as always, racists are mad about the new The Last of Us posters and- Am I? Yeah. Wait, are you the people they're talking about here, Arch? So basically, this article is trying to make the claim that because Joel's daughter was race swap, which we did talk about last episode, people are angry and the fans are, this is fan backlash, it's fan entitlement and it's all this other nonsense that we've heard a thousand times before. However, when you talk about Kenobi or when you talk about the Rings of Power, there's reasons here that they could have that point of view. They're not very good reasons, but there's at least reasons. For this though, I haven't seen this at all. It's like they're trying to manufacture an outrage and like no one is biting. No one's saying anything about this shit. I will defend my dislike of Arrondir to the death. And even you said that Joel's half black daughter didn't actually matter in the end. Well, no, not because of their skin color. Like I don't hate Arrondir because he's Puerto Rican. I hate Arrondir because he can't act. Yeah, his acting is stiff. The thing is, if you get an actor, an actress, and they're not the correct race of a character that they're representing, you can get away with it sometimes if their performance is so stellar that, hey, they were the best one for the pick. It just so happened they had the wrong skin. It's why I actually really enjoyed Disa. Like she's probably one of the best characters in the Rings of Power. That's true. She was. Despite the fact that she wasn't accurate to the lore, she actually did a stellar performance. And that's honestly all that really matters. If they glued a fucking beard onto her, I would have no complaints about her. Now that you've mentioned the dwarves, Naomi and I recently watched The Witcher Blood Origins, which is awful. I don't know if it's even worth doing a video on, but it's so bad. Maybe I'll do a video on it. But like, I did one and it's just, it's my biggest takeaway. Like you could spend a lot of time critiquing the storyline, the acting, the presentation, the costumes. There really is no end. But my biggest complaint is that it manages to make mythical fantasy with a high age elven faction, boring and mundane. One thing I noticed is that that show didn't do bearded dwarf women either. And I'm like, hold on a second. Wasn't there a bearded dwarf woman in the main Witcher show? I was like, what? Why, why didn't you do it in this one? Netflix? What the fuck? But Naomi and I saw this. We were like, oh, I'm surprised they actually did it because this is the, this is the kind of thing Hollywood doesn't like to do, even though it would be body positive. And then they just didn't do it in, in blood origin. So what the fuck? Why? Was there, Oh God, see for a moment, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, like Dev must be why there were no dwarves in that show. And then I remembered that all female dwarf character. She's crazy. She was a dwarf. I fucking hated her so much. She, she put like her dead lover's ashes into her mace and went around killing people. It's so dumb. Cause the worst part is like, Oh, you killed my, my, um, lesbian lover. We didn't see this. We haven't been to like literally the only source we have for this is the clearly insane dwarven. And this thing too, I didn't even register her as a dwarf because she doesn't look like one. She looks like a little person. And since that is all she looks like, they have made no effort to make her look stocky or dwarven in the slightest. And so all I saw was a modern day little person. It was just Peter Dichlage to me. What did they call dwarves too? Anyway? Uh, God, okay. Okay. Devil politically correct. This word for midgets. Yeah. Arches. My mouth is open there. Cause I can't believe our just being PC. I was like, whoa, that's what is the politically correct term for midgets. Let's see a height challenged people. Oh Jesus. Yeah. When people, uh, if you must refer to someone by their condition, uh, dwarf dwarfism and little person or LP are acceptable LP. Yeah. Oh my God. We'll be a little, cause they're a little personal P and midget is considered derogatory. So there you go. And we got way the fuck off topic. My point was just to say, I think we've wandered slightly off topic here. Yeah. Yeah. My point was just to point out that unlike every other thing that we've seen in, in let's say the past year, um, this is the one time where the race swapping didn't seem political, didn't seem to matter, didn't impact anything. And the show is pretty good and yet they're still trying to make it into a political issue because that's what get clicks. Well, of course. Um, I actually, I saw an interesting article on this. I don't know if I saved it cause it was such a pathetic nothing burger. I think, I don't remember where it was, but it wasn't one of the usual baiting sites, right? Yep. And it was trying so hard to find something wrong with the last of us and you could tell they were fishing and I'm kind of sitting here like, why? You're, you're literally just trying to be the contrarian in the room now and Hey, I know I get accused of this. Like we get accused. It's like you only watch it cause it's bad. I'd prefer it if Obiwan was good. I wanted Obiwan to be good, but it wasn't. It's fair. A lot of the comments in the last video have been saying like, why are arch and Kib so negative? I'm so happy that Lilith gives them the Smackdown every now and then with some positivity. And I'm like, well guys, a little, it's not here today. It's not going to happen. I think, I think like, I think all three of us, not so much Lilith, but all three of us, we were like in nitpicky mode in the last, in the last video trying to find the flaws. We were just used to it at this point now, but now I'm like, Oh, it might actually be good. Well, yeah. I mean, how we did it last time is we were actually looking at it. We were all going into it with a very negative mindset because to be honest, we've had a string of terrible shows and it's, it's been exhaustive and it really sort of drains you. It was actually refreshing that the previous episode, cause we even said in the previous episode that it was actually not that bad. Listen to what we say, but that's my favorite part. See, I think like of TV that I've seen in the past five years or so, aside from this, the only thing that's been legitimately good is, uh, the boys is pretty good. Invincible was pretty good. Star Wars, Andor was pretty good. And this, and like everything else has just been raw fucking sewage. I was not fond of Andor. I haven't seen it. So I can't count it. It's, it's not bad. It's actually not bad. I was pleasantly surprised at how, how, you know, not amazing, but serviceable that it was the best parts of Andor would be so much better if Andor just wasn't there. That's my primary complaint. Like I would love to watch a TV show that goes more into depth about the, the, uh, the empire. Like the whole prison thing was really interesting. How they run a prison, the whole security detail and all of that shit. That was really interesting. Uh, even Mon Mothma, although she was the most modern current year of all the characters was all right and had some cool stuff. And I loved, uh, uh, uh, Peter, Peter Lindquist, the, the, the smuggler guy, you know, the guy who was starting the resistance. That was cool shit. I just wish Andor wasn't there. Well, don't worry. He dies later. It's okay. I know that. And that was the reason why I didn't care. Cause I'm like, I know he can't die. He's the, he's the one person in this show I know has the hand of God watching over him. He said he just died, didn't he? No, he dies in the future. Cause this is a prequel. Oh, this is dumb. See, there's only six star wars movies. You guys, you guys need to program here. Okay. Should we, now that we've spoken about every other TV show under the sun, do you want to watch the last of us? If you want to watch the last of us, I actually kind of do. I'm very curious as to how they're going to handle the next sequence. Oh, what happens next? I don't remember in the game. That doesn't matter. I guess. You know, yeah, that's not spoil it. Cause arch, you're still ignorant of all this, right? This is all still new to you. He hasn't played the last of us since we last talked. I don't think let's, uh, let's roll then. Here we go. I'm pressing play. Oh, there was no intro sequence this time with like some flashback or something. I'm sure we'll get to it now. Bangkok 2022. Don't get the parasites into the river parasites into your hand, man. That's cheating. You're almost supposed to go one there. Now you're definitely cheating. Well, you put a little pile of rocks there. You think that's still there after the filming of this, you just go out there and see it, kick it over. Well, there's I know for a fact, there's an abandoned subway station in Toronto. You can go down, you can like sneak down there and just see all the shit that various movie crews left behind because Hollywood goes up there to shoot like subway scenes all the time. Nice. But that's kind of cool. Yeah, it is. What about the sandwich? Yeah. I was about to say, what about the rest of the chicken sandwich? It didn't eat. It might've been a few days. In the wilderness now. Yeah. So we don't know how long it's been. Don't blame me for something that isn't my fault. Wow. You are the least lovable forehead I've ever met. You can still land a plane there though. How did you guys like the thumbnail for the last video? I loved it. It could have like, you could have enhanced the forehead a little further. I only barely enhanced it. I could, it was how, how little I needed to do was okay. Like I want you to set like a plane on it next time that's landed. Like as a man who has a sizable forehead himself, that thing is enormous. He's like, yeah, I can feel this power from here. People are the real monsters, sir. Wouldn't you not want to know if that was the case? Kibs, they changed something. I knew about this. Oh, they're driving weren't they? No, Bill and Frank. One of them was supposed to be dead, but that he's alive in this one. So we're going to see both of them. Oh, okay. No, I missed two. It happens more often than you think. Did you suck at shooting or like in general? Damn. Okay. That's kind of cute. I got to grab some stuff. I stashed. Why do you have stuff fast here? You ask a lot of goddamn questions. So he doesn't have to carry it the next time. He hasn't been out here in a year though. It might not be here. Entirely possible scavengers came by, but how many scavengers are there and how many scavengers are going to check out a random store? I'm presumably she hid it. Mortal Kombat 2. These lines would be better if it wasn't delivered by her. Like I cannot help, but she's just not the right character for this. I actually don't mind the snark between them. Oh no, I like the snark. I just don't like her delivery of it. Because the snark is definitely the thing that really did make the interactions of the video game. Made them endearing. Now I'd be scared personally. Don't fall in. Yeah, don't check with your flashlight down there first or anything. Oh, thank you. I expect something. Yeah, I wouldn't do that. I'm sorry. I'm a fucking pussy. I ain't going down for a minute. This is all new, isn't it? Where's the jump scare? I'm expecting it. It's too tense. It's gonna be here. Ah, she will reach for it. Don't do this to me, Cho. I don't like jump scares. It's gonna happen, Kibbs. There it is. It wasn't gonna be a jump scare? They were actually gonna be building like... Oh, he's sad. He's like, help, I'm stuck. Oh no. Now I'm surprised that he's not dead, because these aren't like zombies, you know? They're not dead that have been reanimated. They're still living things. Surely being crushed for this long would kill you. It might have happened recently. I mean, it had to have, because he hasn't fully turned, his eyes aren't fully covered. I just want to see you like start picking pieces of the mushroom off her. Jesus, what are you doing? That's pretty gross. Now, don't be a fucking monster. Like, just put them down. Yeah, actually, I don't mind that, because she's curious. Like, okay, what's actually inside of you, etc. It's like, wow, I let my hyper important cargo that I killed my fucking girlfriend for just kind of wander away. I mean, to his knowledge, she was only in that other room. No, you think he would have reacted to the clank sound, or the dragging sound, or the thumping sound. That gun's way too big for her. This is kind of stupid, though. Unless he's coming back for that thing fairly soon, that's not going to be fireable by the time he gets back. Yep, his plan is to return. That plane is remarkably intact, considering what happened to it. And how it landed, too. Pilot didn't do too bad. There probably was survivors. So, the tainted food all hits the store shelves around the same time Thursday. People bought it, ate some Thursday night or Friday morning. The day goes on. They started to get sick. Afternoon, evening, they got worse. I think this is all new. Then they started biting. Yeah, this is not a very good explanation, because food goes through a whole fucking hell of a lot of sterilization procedures and shit. Like, you wouldn't just get fungus in there on a national scale. Not only national, because of different plants around the world, but it would only be a local area that would be actually affected. And it would be soon. Flower Made in America isn't really flown to, like, everywhere. This would have to hit, like, every single source of a food supply and then be distributed across the globe. At the same time. Yeah, I know. Like, some grain reaches certain bakeries before other bakeries. They bake the food a day or a few days earlier. Hey, listen, this show turns out to be pretty basic. It's anti-globalist, anti-supply chain. Anti-government, too. Again, the only real complaint I have about this show so far is the whole change to the mushrooms is just a bad change. This is another thing, too. I don't know if this was in the game, but I don't think that would happen because it's going to be very difficult to get soldiers to cold-heartedly gun down civilians because there wasn't room at the fucking hospital. Yes, getting a soldier to start gunning down civilians, especially these civilians are fellow countrymen, is not easy. Some people easily will do it. It's like your families. Here's the flashback. Yeah. The thing is, that's the thing. Soldiers aren't mindless fucking trolls. This is Hollywood we're talking about here, aren't you? Hollywood is kind of anti-army, usually. Hollywood thinks that the military and the police are just these crypto-fascists waiting for orders from whoever happens to hold the reins of power. And they'll gun down whoever the fuck... Oh, yeah, so Bill and Frank, they were like the libertarians, eh? Yeah. Yeah, Bill... I think it was Bill who was the hardcore libertarian who was just like, I've been waiting for so fucking long for the world to collapse so I can live out here in peace. But he didn't live in a forest, he lived in a suburb. He's a base man. What a bossin. He's a collector. That's a selection. Yep. I like he's got Waterloo, the great weasel of lies down there. Oh my god, look, he put on a gas mask. How hard was it for him? Now that's an actor I respect already. Look at that. I think I know who this guy is, so I get recognized his voice. In fact, he's willing to wear a gas mask. This fucking guy. I don't think I would have chosen the shotgun to go out hunting the feds, but... Basically, the feds came through, evacuated everyone, and if you couldn't go, they killed you. He smiled. Oh, it is? It's the fucking guy from... Oh god, what's that show? Oh fuck, I can't remember. I'm actually glad they picked him, though. He's gonna go fishing. Might as well. Might as well. This must be heaven for him. I mean, the power's still on, so you might as well... Yep, it's gonna be off soon. Yeah. That was fast. That was fast, unironically. Only lasted a day. All my commenters were saying that the feds couldn't shut off their gas stoves. Yes, they fucking could. He had to turn it back on. I like this scene a lot. The doomsday prepper gets what he wants. Yep. There's gonna be some traps. I actually really appreciate these flashback scenes when it's like this. Showing us the characters before. I didn't appreciate the previous ones, but this one's nice. The previous one was bad, but this one... He's growing veggies. He's got chickens. Yeah, man. He's gonna be living a good life. Yeah. I want to point out that everyone that's in the federal camps are starving to death right now, or having food shortages. This guy's living the time of his life. It's gonna get a little lonely, though. No, he turned back on the electricity, or is that the generator? What did he do at the gas plant? He turned back on the natural gas to the city. You would have thought that this guy like this would have an independent gas supply, like, you know, the gas canisters in the stove. But here comes a zombie. The show is growing on me more. Oh, he's like turned the suburb into a... He's like built a gate and all this shit. Damn. Yep. Don't tread on me. Oh, my God. I think he has a Windows XP computer. Looks like it. Well, if you don't want your shit to crash. I mean, I just like the attention to detail. That's great. Baltimore QZ. It's gone. Damn. You're hurt. How did he fall into the hole? He was down. He camouflaged it with a fucking chicken net. That thing would be hard to see. He's how the hell did he get one of the federal scanners? He probably just killed some of them while they were out. They might have left him in some areas. And every bum you talk to about it is going to show up here looking for a free lunch. And this is not an Arby's. Free lunch was a restaurant. I mean, after four years, the isolation is bound to be getting at him. Yeah. In fact, I'm kind of shocked that he hasn't gone literally insane yet. I just noticed that this guy is Ron Swanson. Jesus. Yes. That's why I'm so glad they got him. He played Ron Swanson. It's like the same character. Yep. This is a stellar pick, by the way. Well, I wish you were hot blonde, but I guess you'll have to do. What? What just happened? I'm just looking around and he's suspicious. He's so happy. It's like, yeah, that is the correct response, though, considering what he's probably been so used to is. You're welcome. Oh, this is a heartwarming scene, you know. It is so I guess I'll be going on. This is you. He's reading them like a book. Yeah. Oh, my God. It's my favorite. He's like, I'm a musician. I'm valuable. I can raise morale. It's been a little bit. Give me a break. Oh, sure. How long since that piano was? Oh, no, they're going to get tangled. So he's going to be alive now. Yeah, because in the original game, he was dead. And that's why it was super abrasive, if I'm right, or was it drunk? I can't remember something like a weird or about him because he was gone. So, wait, Arch, how how did your gaydar go off on this? Quite a while ago, honestly. No, it's it's obvious. Even if you don't know, this was charged for quite a while now. So it wasn't spoiled for you? No, because for me, it's like I was sitting there thinking like, this is probably going to be the gay scene. See? Well, this isn't anything new because this is how it was in the original game. So it's not always a thing. But this is more like an origin story to how I will say it was a little bit forced. Like this was I don't know, like I didn't mind this. This is actually decent because they're in the apocalypse. Like the guy's been lonely for four years. They're they're both nervous. But this guy, the guy on the bed, he comes across as a little bit too seductory. You have the other guy. The other guy's doing a better job. It doesn't like actually, I think this guy is doing a better job because he's. I like him a lot as an actor. Because they're the guy on the bed. He comes across as way too suave for this. Like, wait, no, I don't want a sex scene, though. Like the romance is fine. No, Kim's got to watch it. No, it feels a pinch forced. I feel like instead of a scene, this should be their relationship after a week or a month or two. But I guess time constraints. So, man, see, I like everything except for like, I don't like I don't need to watch. I have sex for lunches. That's fair, even great ones. Come on, that was at least a dinner. It's a bit cheap. I didn't really pick up on anything gay until the piano. Even though I knew that they were gay because the game. But like, still, I had pent up on the gay around the shower scene. Oh, the shower scene, the shower scene, because he acted very giddy, like nervous around it. Like he was in the shower. He was like, Oh, my God, you're in the shower. Yeah, oh, come on. Hey, would you stop? I like that. It wasn't actually just a sex scene noise. You live in a psycho bunker where 9-11 was an inside job and the government are all Nazis. The government are all Nazis. OK, hold on a second. I'll pause there for a second. I need to tweet. That's brilliant. I love it. Oh, man, this might be my favorite episode yet. Yeah, this is pretty good. You know, it's actually kind of refreshing. And you know what? For an HBO show, I was worried they were going to go the gross path where it's like, pep. And I was like, oh, but they actually just like they cut to black. They cut or they did not cut back. They cut the screen before anything started. And that's good, because the important part about the show is you to tell the story and narrative elements and the relationships between the two characters. You don't need to focus on the non-essentials. The flat flaps the groups. You have it, kids, you're out here getting your cheeks plapped all the time. Listen, that's for money. That's a different again. this it was a little bit too obvious in my opinion because the other guy came across as overtly sexual quite early on and he he comes across as way too much of a seductress i don't see it at all i mean it's just me i like bill zach what the fuck's his name he's he's fucking stellar i i think it's absolutely hilarious how bill does the whole 9 11 truth of the government are all nazis and it turns out he was right but there's like a weird left right overlap here where you have like the libertarians who sometimes say the exact same thing as the socialists about government well in this universe the the government basically was too too super controlling didn't relinquish power are you are you pissing there kibbs jesus oh sorry i was pouring myself some tea oh okay listen your mic's all fixed now your mic's fixed we can hear that at this point oh damn that picked that up yeah i was pouring myself some more tea i wasn't peeing into the cup i swear but uh yeah i actually think that's pretty cool also they chose the best actor to play bill yeah they did they should have done like he meets him he picks him up and they kind of like okay you can say you can stay the night and then like three days later then you do the piano scene or something yeah i would have liked this to be a little bit less starstruck romance but i'm gayer than you fixing up some of the shops yes bill is the more masculine ones are we hosting formal garden parties now no there might be but we are gonna have friends excuse me he wants to build a town yep he wants to build the community i've actually been talking to a nice woman on the radio you what that's not gonna be fucking happy right this is that that is actually extraordinarily stupid okay we have all of these resources here uh would you like to uh come on over and sample some of them i'm the same way this is how they met i'm not schizophrenic he's gonna pull out the gun he has under the table which i get by the way how nice this is to have a civilized meal in such a beautiful place he doesn't oh that's disappointing i mean that's way more fun we don't end up working together they made both of them look a lot younger working together the actors and actresses i mean like they are younger in the in the story but like they really de-age them nicely with makeup or age them up with makeup in the present whatever i want to show you something not inside frank frank bill's mad yep i understand i still want him to be holding a gun under the table he'll come at night quiet and armed that is true i mean this place screams easy pickings yeah you need more people here you need a little town not just the two of you more manpower would be useful for defense yeah those traps in that fence is not going to be an obstacle to people with tools well organized hungry looking for resources um well they put a bunch of fucking cars he's fortified a bit like i can't just one more loop around i got something to show you huh not that oh he got excited it's radishes it looks like strawberries a little one a little one i expected it to be more pissed about that and yeah they were strawberries you thought they were radishes it's close to these strawberry bushes yummy strawberry they're very tiny strawberry not natural strawberries by the way those are modern day bio-engineered berries yeah chunky at my uh girlfriend's childhood home they have strawberry bushes in the back and they're much bigger bushes with much smaller berries yes those are modern day strawberries this episode has actually been pretty good at building these two characters up yep so yeah no this is actually probably the single best gay romance i think i've ever seen i'm quite enjoying this a rain catcher uh-oh stormy night that means shit's about to go down boys prepare for some tragedy they're ready okay that's more than a little stereotypical but flame throwers yes i was about to say like holy fuck hey you gotta wake up dude it's time oh shit he's just taking him out yep bill's already out there he's going to help yep the woman has armed herself with a ppk and it's going to come help dude just stay in the house he's just in the middle of the fucking street get inside he's gonna yeah i was about to say he's gonna get him killed we gotta get you inside no no to be fair it was bloody retarded for him to stand in the middle of the street fucking illuminated by the fire okay i think it's time for the bandits to call it quits that's a lot of casualties yep he'll take care of you you lied to me dev i lied to you he died oh definitely looks like he died yeah there's no way because bill's the one that survives out of the two in the game oh thank god there's no wheelchair now oh damn they're a little old oh no the other one's in a wheelchair okay oh no uh so you just kind of skipped over the whole recovery period he's just he's he's fine now bill's the one recovered the other guys in the wheelchair dead not good i mean 10 years you can recover in 10 years yeah but i i would have liked to seen it rather than just like yeah he was fine damn they did a better job of aging these guys up than the obi-wan show did aging anakin down yeah did you see that somebody used a snapchat filter and did a better job yeah that was sad so he must be ill or something yeah that looks like some sort of what is it where joe biden can't draw a clock what's that called again he's having a hard time eating yeah yeah i i don't necessarily think this is illness i think this is old because that's a pretty good painting everything is it i know he's a prepper but he should have spent the past 20 years building a little town rather than just living like this you know if they had a community that would probably would have made them stronger in the end but yeah yep now they're gonna die alone sad and childless i should have taken a little child orphan that wandered by the fence that didn't blow up yeah that didn't get the shotgun or something like oh look this one's alive i want to keep it i want to keep a little suicide on top at all just to make it extra sad what if what if someone he shows up there wasn't anything to cure this before the world fell apart oh this is cancer oh he's terminal you'll wear what i ask who will get married it's time for drag queen story hour you cook a delicious dinner and then i'm going to take all of these he pranted flowers where did they get the paint from they could probably make it also entirely popularly it was dried paint and all they do is moisturize it home depot traded for it anything in the eyes of god you're still degenerates damn it's true though yeah it's true though i mean marriage is more of a christian thing anyways i know filthy christian i'm a heathen i am when it suits me fair enough rabbits like their first meeting i guess nice touch a lot of this is unique to the show they didn't go into nearly as much detail yeah now the problem with crushing pills and your alcohol is that it's gonna taste like ass afterwards yeah that's why you should just be a man and gulp them down immediately well now they're gonna do it here comes the meal first okay i gotta point out they've still got a wine left after like 20 30 years he must have had quite the fucking stock well also the wine store remember yeah true but even a wine store there's yeah true but even a wine store there's a limit to how much wine is in that store i don't think they're drinking wine every day probably only special occasions you know savoring it yeah that's gonna taste fucking awful you barely stirred it like the spoon my wine is gonna taste awful oh damn that would be so hard to do you guys better get in bed quick might be fast acting sleeping meds it should take a while but from an objective point of view it's incredibly romantic damn yeah that's how you know she's not a woman because otherwise she'd be mad right now she'd be menstruating violently and now will joel and uh forehead come about and find them dead in their each other's arms in bed so you're telling me dev lied extra hard they both died anyways well uh i did now this is actually very very different i don't know if you recall kibbs but in the game if you found all the logs um these two had a fight frank had run away from bill and died somewhere out there and then you bring the news back to bill and bill is pissed about it and he but also frank left a note basically saying you fucking destroyed my life i hate you you ruined everything i'm glad to be free of you it's like it's jesus it's it's not a happy ending i think i prefer this one this this one is more sad that one was more like damn damn they still have gas for their generator after all these years like i'm sorry my gas will have turned to fucking jello by this time oh power so long stay there this is probably the next day or something still here the generator too like at least turn it off at the end i feel like they've got better things to worry about i'm sorry frank i'm just gonna have to go outside and turn off the generator real quick before we die in our each other's arms now that's what i call a fire hazard yeah you guys should put the candles too the lights are still on yeah this is literally the next day yeah there's a heavy pattern of dust on the thing maybe not yeah because that or is there or is it just the sun on the table it's kind of yeah i see i see i'm not sure no maybe not no i think it might actually be just the next day or no it's no no it's definitely all the next day no it's been a little bit yeah yeah yeah you can see it clearly there the dust it's been a couple weeks maybe something like that oh god your wide googly eyes not enormous forehead triggers me so hello it's quite the forehead though you can admire its power hey joel here's the keys to the castle oh she went outside what the fuck yeah joel you really should keep a closer eye on that no well there she is i was just windowing fuck bev to whomever but probably joe i figured i fell under whomever him was this so he's dead now no that's kind of lame i was gonna be accidentally survived they poisoned each other yeah somebody fucked up the dosage and lived so they're dead 2023 the last gay person on earth passed away if you find this please do not come into the bedroom we left the window open so the house wouldn't smell it will probably be a sight i'm guessing you found this joel because anyone else would have been electrocuted or blown up by one of my traps at least he's a sick bastard the bunker code is the same as the gate code but in reverse anyway i never liked you but still it's like we're friends almost and they kept a bit of that spirit in there if i never liked you yeah a bit late sorry about that hold that tongue try to keep tris alive okay wish you told me that sooner yes not tris that was close keep her safe joel definitely don't let her blow up in a building full of zombies that'd be fucked up don't get weird ntr'd with a like tentacle kisser that's very descriptive i know but i have a feeling yeah definitely don't let her choke on any fungus once you're not around we're kind of weird sick how did he know that pablo is having an emotional moment that cut on his cheek just never seems to grow does it grow grow close you mean heal yeah it should be fading at some point shouldn't it i think it well it takes a couple days yeah but it's been a couple of days all right all right come here let me give you a cut and we'll see how it's like no it's the bill mobile truck to be fair joel would be smart to try and start his own little town out here holy shit this is still a fully stocked place this guy was a genius a garand too grab some cans from over there nothing dented or swollen dude no the winchester let it have the winchester those aren't cans you stupid fucking oh listen toilet paper toiletries are a pleasantry five they haven't like the amount of shit this dude must have looted to last all these years he had a whole town to loot yeah but even that's not that much shit i'm taking a shower and then you're showering seriously damn oh women fuck oh yeah just close it don't worry about that i mean the people here are dead but at the same time god yeah i guess i'm the only one thinking about the future because i'm i'm really like okay you know what they should do turn off everything when they leave like lock this place up maybe it's useful in the future ah the woman gun the night don't fuck i thought she was gonna look down the the gun goes off in her backpack from throwing it around and then an iconic rear view shot as they drive out the gate forgetting to turn off the generator and all of the other valuable stuff there yep as the volume increases yep and it stops being a radio broadcast it becomes actually a soundtrack come on do the iconic rear view shot as they leave the game don't disappoint me baby tv show whatever the fuck you are i'm still gonna say bill died though i want to see how bill would talk to people oh i'll take it i'll take it from the open window camera the last rancid shot of the fucking desiccated skeletons that's a little unnecessary don't do that i think i'm gonna love you tasteful just the way i like it wow that was a surprisingly tasteful episode yeah i didn't go too far i will say it feels like a bit of a fucking waste but what do you mean look at this little pessimistic poly there was there was no actual story progression here pretty much it was more of a thing for the uh people who played the video games to appreciate these characters it also sets up that in this world despite all the tragedies despite all the hardships and all the horrors that there were people that still were able to have find happiness in life well it's not just that it is that but it's also the fact that if they were gonna include like just these levels from the game they had to they had to flesh them out right because i don't know if you recall the area around bill's place kibbs but there was a bunch of just like fetch quests and you're going through like through a suburb and you're just finding stuff for bill and he's like listen i'll help you out but you gotta do something for me go find this and it's like it's it's video gamey right so they had if they're gonna put him in and put his story in they had to do something different with it yep instead of it being a fetch quest which honestly is a better way to wrap up his section of the thing and for people who played the video game it actually adds quite a bit because it adds a lot more insight based on the notes about you know his life that changed the more dark ending where frank just sort of fucks off and dies yeah they changed the part where uh yeah they're actually estranged lovers and frank dies and bill just cries about it in his house as you drive away once upon a time i had somebody that i cared about partner somebody i had to look after and in this world that sort of shit's good for one thing getting you killed so you know what it did why isn't the fuck up and i realized it's got to be just me bill today it ain't like that it's bullshit it is just like that jesus what do you know this guy or something frank who the hell's frank he was my partner he's the only idiot that would wear a shirt like that he's got bites here and here i reckon he didn't want to turn so yeah i guess not well fuck him that's my battery that fucking asshole jesus that's more of my stuff so what you just just gonna steal my shit and run off is that it frank bill i uh i found this in there and i uh i figured you should have it and that's how you feel well fuck you too frank fucking idiot you ready to go you think well it's a bit more awkward but yes that's true it was a bit more tasteful and they did it very tasteful too like when it came to the sex scenes they didn't they didn't make it weird like a lot of hbo shows do and they also didn't do that thing where they could show the window and show the corpses there be like look it's gritty like okay thank you kind of sour the moment they understood that uh it had a very pleasant feel the whole episode now what's the next part of the game kibbs you recall uh my memory's all screwed up i'm gonna play last of us one like once and the problem is every time i'm thinking about the last of us i keep i can't unsee the last of us part two sections i also keep mixing up with like the early storylines of the walking dead because it's very similar the next bit is where they get ambushed in pittsburgh remember that kibbs that there's that famous scene yeah he's like he's not even injured and just like runs him over that's gonna that's gonna be great okay so i know where we are in the plot now okay i'm still just not at all hooked into this show if anything if there is any weakness to this show it is that for somebody who like me who doesn't have nostalgia goggles for the show i'm not i'm just not interested well this was a this was a nice gay romance and it's one of the most uh tasteful ones i think i've ever seen but i was like i don't know these people it's it's more of a show written for what feels like the people who played the video game and honestly yeah i'll take that i'll take that over what we got with the halo show where it was meant for the general audience and not the halo fans because that was the biggest fucking thing with the halo tv show that made it so bad it had nothing to do with halo it had halo characters and their names thrown around but miranda keys captain keys all these people they none of them were at all their characters they were just skin suits here these characters feel much more alive and that i can appreciate though i do understand arches point for the for the newcomer the person who's never played last of us and whatnot like it's gonna come across as like hey like why did we have a huge background story for some family when you could have done this differently because for from arches point of view what would have been probably better for the newcomer would actually be taking use of visual storytelling entering the room seeing the dust gathered seeing the pictures on the wall you can disseminate you know the relationship of these two characters that are dead and they could it would have been a much shorter and smaller sequence but you could have done it in a different way i suppose to make it more approachable for newcomers but at the same time it's a huge section of the game and it's really hard to just walk around it it kind of had to be touched up on it does feel like this was made specifically for the fans at this point because they spent so much time on a character that doesn't matter in terms of the actual story but matters if you played the game it's better than the reverse fan service is better than ignoring the fans yes that is absolutely correct and again it's still so far has actually proven to be one of the the better video game adaptations it still lacks in some areas like that the mold retcon just feels very unnecessary in my opinion unnecessary pointless and just flat out worse than the original because i don't know i just don't know why they did it because the the tendril idea of stepping on the spores currently they did it because they wanted to stomp out the last piece of the check who made it yeah and the thing is i did see at the beginning of the episode well i did actually like this one quite a bit neil drachman is still executive producer i believe like the problem with him is he is actively he's he's being a douche like the original girl who the last of us like made her story about these characters and set it up and it kind of seems like every time she's done something kind of cool or really interesting he actively is trying to sabotage her work like in last of us part two with sabotaging ellie's character and basically fucking her up and making her out to be a terrible person like that's just kind of bad so it feels like the show is hindered by neil drachman uh in the background honestly if they just lost him i think the show would probably be doing a lot better how how is it actually doing in terms of people watching it and like like reviews and stuff what i can't it's actually doing very well it actually grew its audience after episode one which is very unusual yep because word of mouth that happened with revenge of the sith when people uh during its launch like people were like i don't know last two movies are a bit special and people hey it's actually pretty good and then people started to go see it i'm gonna look for it on uh good old rotten tomatoes tomatoes oh my god jeez 97 tomato meter and 96 audience score i don't know if it's that good maybe people just need something that's like decent nowadays and they'll just throw they'll throw 90s at it in the modern world the house of dragons is a masterpiece because it's not complete shit and that's it's actually tragic because our our standards have lowered quite a bit because everything that's been coming out our standards have polarized because all we know is garbage or gems that's actually lowered actually technically i was right i think arch is a bit no you're dumb it's not no no you're dumb it's not what it means at all our standards have lowered no no no no you're lowered too you know well if they uh if they keep going with the plot i don't know how many episodes they're going to be in the season eight episodes ten episodes i'm not sure but if they keep going with the main plot i mean we're this is about a quarter of the way through the game so i guess we'll have to see i'll just see how long it takes the value of this episode is going to be apparent at the end of it because this was an entire episode dedicated to back characters if this ends up leaving the plot feeling rushed at the end then it will not have been worth it oh true like if we get to the end of this see this season and we find out that all like it feels rushed or any way like missing something then that means that this episode actually will have detracted from the primary plot which is very bad but that's going to have to be found out later on in the show i guess if they wanted to make a more contemporary show what they could have done is they could have had them stop at bill's and then bill's place gets overrun and then bill has to leave with them that's what a normal zombie story would do and then if you wanted flashback later to bill's life after he's become a character that you care about i mean i think a normal zombie story would would make a story like that just because you have to have a reason to care about bill but like like i said before i think the the show just assumes that you played the game and so you already care about him yep so you want to know about bill and frank for the newcomer if we didn't tell barge about bill and frank well you'd be like who what the fuck like this whole sequence would make no sense yeah and we also primed him for that fact that that's also something to take into consideration the whole episode was spent dealing with them so for a newcomer who's never played this before or played the video game they'll be like what what why are we on this weird side tangent with these two characters that's gonna come out left field a little bit for them so that's the end of the of the video oh i guess we should probably point out that uh in the middle of the of the recording love love showed up and was like what the fuck time zones man that's how it is dev's planning don't lie dev it's not just dev's planning listen listen no she had to work tonight if we had actually waited for a little if we wouldn't be starting till about right now that would be way too late for you arch yes yeah so hopefully next time she won't have to work nights and she'll be here next time hopefully hopefully i guess that's it huh yes that's the end oh i thought you were gonna do like an outro thing well me saying hopefully is the outro maybe i don't know oh i don't know if i don't know if you've noticed but i usually just end my videos whenever i fucking end them i just drop them you lazy little town see i feel like you should you know be like all right see you guys you know later or something you're just like get out of here all right fine then kibbs here's the outro here it is i'll do one just for you okay the one episode that you two aren't massively homophobic is the one episode that Lilith can't make it i can't believe it ah we'll have to get back to our act then i've never been afraid of gay people he's like i just hate them", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek":
