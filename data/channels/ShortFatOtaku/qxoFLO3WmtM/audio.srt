1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
During the GameBoomer Shenmue stream, Dave and I talked about why Japan is so rich despite having

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,880
a relatively low population and almost no natural resources. Because that was a let's play and not

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,080
me actually sitting down and figuring things out, I stumbled all over the topic as I'm apt to do.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,760
So let's actually go over this a little bit. In Professor David Landy's book,

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,080
The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, he explores the question of why some nations are rich and

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,480
others are not. He basically comes to the conclusion that a variety of factors caused

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,800
Europe to be the world's powerhouse. Landy's believed that Protestantism in Northern Europe

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,200
drove the population to value hard work, punctuality, free thinking, and the free market

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,960
more than Catholic Southern Europe and significantly more than the rest of the world.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,720
Which, while valuing hard work pretty uniformly, almost always dissuaded free thinking. He also

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,440
believed in the hydraulic thesis that centrally managed states kept their grip on power through

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,400
the use of water control, and in the climate thesis that tropical regions are, all things

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,560
considered, harder to develop technologically. But most important to us, he believed that

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,640
cultures that were higher in trust were more likely to be wealthy regardless of other factors.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,120
They could be poor in human resources, in natural resources. They could be isolated. It didn't

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,120
matter. If the people were able to trust each other, wealth would generate for each person

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,520
in proportion to how much work they performed. That does seem to line up with reality. Like I

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,920
said, Japan's a nation with basically nothing but rocks in the water, and they're a world economic

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
powerhouse. Meanwhile, you have places like Venezuela, or Africa, or the Soviet Union.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,360
Natural resources everywhere, but constant corruption, waste, and poverty. It would seem

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,520
to me that simply having stuff doesn't automatically make you rich. Another book,

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,960
Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond, also has some ideas that mesh quite well here.

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,200
It's not hard to figure out that technological advancement is only possible when a society

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
transitions from hunter-gatherer status to agricultural status. Long-term complex

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,760
invention requires that you stay in one place for a long period of time. Staying in one place

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,640
requires a surplus of food. A surplus of food requires three things. Animals capable of thriving

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
in captivity rather than dying off or becoming violent, hearty, high-carbohydrate vegetation

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
able to be cultivated by farmers, and a dry, cool climate to allow for long-term storage.

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,120
So basically, Europe and Asia. However, Europe still had a few more advantages up its sleeve.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,600
China remained a water bureaucracy long after Europe had transitioned to basic feudalism,

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,960
because rice requires significantly more water to grow than grain. Most great human civilizations

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,440
began due to the ability to control the water for irrigation, like the Egyptians, Indus,

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,240
and Mayans. But the climate's always been fickle, and the states that survived stopped revolving so

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,880
heavily around water control. Nonetheless, the extra food allowed for both organized religion

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,240
and complicated bureaucracy, as society could now afford to feed priests and nobles. Europe and Asia

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,880
also had a trade advantage. They were able to transfer food, animals, and goods along the same

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,520
latitude, while African and American traders had to trade across climates, limiting their options.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,880
Europeans also cultivated an immunity to disease, from living closely with livestock, to widespread

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,760
trade and travel with other ethnic groups, to access to a wider variety of foods. These diseases

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,320
would prove devastating in European contact with North America, where it's estimated that most

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,880
native death occurred due to disease transmission. But ultimately, it would be Europe that came out

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,000
on top due to the geography of the area. There's been many, many attempts to unite Europe under the

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,040
same banner. The EU is only the latest one, and they almost always fail because the geography of

44
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,840
Europe lends itself to isolationism. Different languages, ethnicities, and traditions are more

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,360
likely to stay separate than join up. The European coastline is jagged and irregular. Islands are

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,000
everywhere. There's great mountain ranges and dense forests. Look at how many countries that are in

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,120
Europe. There's an equal number of ethnicities in China, but China's almost always had a stronger

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,480
cultural impetus towards being a unified nation because 1. the water situation required it to be,

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,720
and 2. the landscape's composition of flatlands and rivers made wars of conquest more possible.

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,600
In fact, there's even another theory that the three greatest human civilizations to ever exist

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,720
flourished around three semi-isolated large bodies of water, leading to both seafood consumption and

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,880
cultures that were at least somewhat more isolationist than the surrounding nomads were.

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,600
We keep coming back to isolationism, for all of its flaws, because it's an important step in

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,880
cultural development. The idea of individuality arises from isolationism. You know, each person

55
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,360
is a nation unto themself, and all that. The world's greatest religions almost always put

56
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,240
forward a single individual as both a hero and a manifestation of the divine. In Europe,

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,280
paradoxically being both packed with people, as well as having a geography that tends towards

58
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,320
isolationist cultures, had the best possible environment for the idea of human individual

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,640
rights to come about, after thousands of years anyway. Okay, we're way off topic, but this is

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,680
all important stuff. A wide array of conditions, from climate to geographic, generated a culture

61
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,760
in Europe that created individualism and thus kicked off the Enlightenment, which led to our

62
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,040
modern technologically advanced society. And Asia was basically able to tag along, because their own

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,000
climate and geography allowed them to get about 80% of the way there on their own anyway. Diseases

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
wiped out the population of the Americas and Australia, because they never had a reason to

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,920
gain an immunity to them. And the Middle East and Africa existed in a climate where a booming

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,480
advance was basically impossible long term. My first takeaway is, hey, alt-right. It's not race

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,720
that caused white people to be a dominant global force. So the ethno-state is an ideal that it

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,920
would be a state for all people of the white race. It would be our homeland, it would be our safe

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,880
space. My second takeaway is that when idiots like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talk about growing

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,520
yucca root in North America because the brown immigrants are somehow intrinsically tied to

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,360
the food from their native lands, she sounds like a moron who doesn't understand that race is

72
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,080
separate from agriculture. Our communities are naturally in tune to live in an environmentally

73
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:53,200
conscious way. When someone says that it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca instead

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:03,200
of, I don't know, cauliflower or something, what you're doing is that you're taking a colonial

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,480
approach to environmentalism. You've both got the same ass-backwards blood and soil argument,

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,440
and you're both idiots. So Professor Landes spent a great deal of time in his book correlating the

77
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,520
levels of interpersonal trust between your average people and the wealth of the nation,

78
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,840
finding a pretty close correlation. And we also know, thanks to Jared Diamond's work,

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
that primarily Europe, but to a much lesser extent Asia, eventually created societies with

80
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,200
some concept of individualism, due to many factors not limited to water supply, trade opportunities,

81
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,240
climate, vegetation, and geography. How do these two things piece together? Well, in a society that

82
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
values human rights, that enshrines the individual at the core of political thought, there's high

83
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,000
levels of interpersonal trust. Think of it this way, each and every single one of us has a

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,720
truckload of problems. Problems with school, problems with our home life, with our girlfriends,

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,000
our boyfriends, our family, our kids, our parents, problems with ourself, health problems,

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,440
addiction, poverty, you name it, we have it. And any one of those problems could turn us into an

87
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,160
absolute lying, thieving, cheating catastrophe. But they generally don't, all things considered.

88
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,440
Let's say you and I are building a house together. When we make the business deal,

89
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,080
we're accepting that yes, each of us has many reasons to simply ruin the deal,

90
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,200
but we're trusting each other that we won't. When you trust me, you're inviting the best of

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,880
me to step forth. And when I trust you, I'm doing the same. And when we both trust each other,

92
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,040
we have time to actually do the work that we've agreed to do. If I don't trust you,

93
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm not going to be working on the house, because I don't think you'll be working on the house.

94
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,120
So I'll be micromanaging you, hovering over your shoulder, double checking your work, etc.

95
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,480
But if we both just accept at face value that we're faulty people, and presume we're going to

96
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,760
deal with ourselves as best we can, we can simply get the job done and get paid. This is why the

97
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,520
micromanaging manager at a retail store is almost always the cause of both his worker's malcontent

98
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,160
and the store's long-term failure. This is why eBay wasn't the massive flop that it was

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,480
predicted to be. Back when it was new, the general perception was that I would send you garbage and

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,960
you would send me a check that I couldn't cash. But that's not what happened. People were actually

101
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,200
honest. And suddenly you have online shopping, something that could have never been invented

102
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,440
in a low-trust society. Just like there's a correlation between high-trust societies and

103
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
wealth, there's a correlation between high-trust societies and societies that manage to develop

104
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,720
at least some semblance of human rights, stemming from individuality born from isolationism. The

105
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,480
G7 consists of America, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. All European or Asian

106
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,800
based countries with high levels of trust and respect for human rights. Now this development

107
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,720
of a high-trust society can obviously be disrupted by an outside force. Communism absolutely ruined

108
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
China in this regard. It probably could have been there by now without it if Taiwan's any indication.

109
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Totalitarian systems of government, from communism to Nazism to Sharia Islam to all the rest,

110
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,560
all share a tendency to turn high-trust societies into low-trust ones. I can't build the house with

111
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,040
you honestly because I don't know if you're a member of the secret police or a party informant

112
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,920
or if you're here to judge my vices and my virtues. A state that leaves people alone gives

113
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,400
people time to trust their fellow man. It's why the free market works because we're all given a

114
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,600
faith shot at it. It's why democracy works because we're all able to have our say truthfully and

115
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,240
without punishment for going against the grain. And it's also why importing massive numbers of

116
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,640
people from low-trust societies without giving them time to assimilate will destroy us in the

117
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,120
long run. We might think we're being humanitarians but they just view us as suckers. We can judge a

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,920
culture by what it produces. And Western culture uniquely produced the best civilization in the

119
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,760
history of our species. It's not because of genetic superiority, though we shouldn't be

120
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,000
ashamed of our genes. It's not because we stole it off the backs of somebody else, though we're

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,960
not responsible for our history. It's because our environment cultivated the best way of thinking,

122
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,320
of speaking, of acting in the world. I like living in and being a member of my high-trust society,

123
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,880
thank you very much. I'm not sorry for it. I'm not ashamed of it. And I'm not willing to sacrifice

124
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
it on the altar of political correctness.
