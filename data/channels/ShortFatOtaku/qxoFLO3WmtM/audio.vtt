00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
During the GameBoomer Shenmue stream, Dave and I talked about why Japan is so rich despite having

00:05.760 --> 00:10.880
a relatively low population and almost no natural resources. Because that was a let's play and not

00:10.880 --> 00:16.080
me actually sitting down and figuring things out, I stumbled all over the topic as I'm apt to do.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.760
So let's actually go over this a little bit. In Professor David Landy's book,

00:19.760 --> 00:24.080
The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, he explores the question of why some nations are rich and

00:24.080 --> 00:28.480
others are not. He basically comes to the conclusion that a variety of factors caused

00:28.480 --> 00:32.800
Europe to be the world's powerhouse. Landy's believed that Protestantism in Northern Europe

00:32.800 --> 00:37.200
drove the population to value hard work, punctuality, free thinking, and the free market

00:37.200 --> 00:40.960
more than Catholic Southern Europe and significantly more than the rest of the world.

00:40.960 --> 00:46.720
Which, while valuing hard work pretty uniformly, almost always dissuaded free thinking. He also

00:46.720 --> 00:51.440
believed in the hydraulic thesis that centrally managed states kept their grip on power through

00:51.440 --> 00:56.400
the use of water control, and in the climate thesis that tropical regions are, all things

00:56.400 --> 01:00.560
considered, harder to develop technologically. But most important to us, he believed that

01:00.560 --> 01:04.640
cultures that were higher in trust were more likely to be wealthy regardless of other factors.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.120
They could be poor in human resources, in natural resources. They could be isolated. It didn't

01:09.120 --> 01:13.120
matter. If the people were able to trust each other, wealth would generate for each person

01:13.120 --> 01:17.520
in proportion to how much work they performed. That does seem to line up with reality. Like I

01:17.520 --> 01:21.920
said, Japan's a nation with basically nothing but rocks in the water, and they're a world economic

01:21.920 --> 01:26.560
powerhouse. Meanwhile, you have places like Venezuela, or Africa, or the Soviet Union.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.360
Natural resources everywhere, but constant corruption, waste, and poverty. It would seem

01:31.360 --> 01:35.520
to me that simply having stuff doesn't automatically make you rich. Another book,

01:35.520 --> 01:40.960
Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond, also has some ideas that mesh quite well here.

01:40.960 --> 01:45.200
It's not hard to figure out that technological advancement is only possible when a society

01:45.200 --> 01:49.680
transitions from hunter-gatherer status to agricultural status. Long-term complex

01:49.680 --> 01:53.760
invention requires that you stay in one place for a long period of time. Staying in one place

01:53.760 --> 01:58.640
requires a surplus of food. A surplus of food requires three things. Animals capable of thriving

01:58.640 --> 02:03.200
in captivity rather than dying off or becoming violent, hearty, high-carbohydrate vegetation

02:03.200 --> 02:08.080
able to be cultivated by farmers, and a dry, cool climate to allow for long-term storage.

02:08.080 --> 02:13.120
So basically, Europe and Asia. However, Europe still had a few more advantages up its sleeve.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.600
China remained a water bureaucracy long after Europe had transitioned to basic feudalism,

02:17.600 --> 02:22.960
because rice requires significantly more water to grow than grain. Most great human civilizations

02:22.960 --> 02:27.440
began due to the ability to control the water for irrigation, like the Egyptians, Indus,

02:27.440 --> 02:32.240
and Mayans. But the climate's always been fickle, and the states that survived stopped revolving so

02:32.240 --> 02:36.880
heavily around water control. Nonetheless, the extra food allowed for both organized religion

02:36.880 --> 02:42.240
and complicated bureaucracy, as society could now afford to feed priests and nobles. Europe and Asia

02:42.240 --> 02:46.880
also had a trade advantage. They were able to transfer food, animals, and goods along the same

02:46.880 --> 02:51.520
latitude, while African and American traders had to trade across climates, limiting their options.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.880
Europeans also cultivated an immunity to disease, from living closely with livestock, to widespread

02:56.880 --> 03:01.760
trade and travel with other ethnic groups, to access to a wider variety of foods. These diseases

03:01.760 --> 03:06.320
would prove devastating in European contact with North America, where it's estimated that most

03:06.320 --> 03:10.880
native death occurred due to disease transmission. But ultimately, it would be Europe that came out

03:10.880 --> 03:16.000
on top due to the geography of the area. There's been many, many attempts to unite Europe under the

03:16.000 --> 03:21.040
same banner. The EU is only the latest one, and they almost always fail because the geography of

03:21.040 --> 03:25.840
Europe lends itself to isolationism. Different languages, ethnicities, and traditions are more

03:25.840 --> 03:31.360
likely to stay separate than join up. The European coastline is jagged and irregular. Islands are

03:31.360 --> 03:36.000
everywhere. There's great mountain ranges and dense forests. Look at how many countries that are in

03:36.000 --> 03:41.120
Europe. There's an equal number of ethnicities in China, but China's almost always had a stronger

03:41.120 --> 03:46.480
cultural impetus towards being a unified nation because 1. the water situation required it to be,

03:46.480 --> 03:52.720
and 2. the landscape's composition of flatlands and rivers made wars of conquest more possible.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.600
In fact, there's even another theory that the three greatest human civilizations to ever exist

03:57.600 --> 04:02.720
flourished around three semi-isolated large bodies of water, leading to both seafood consumption and

04:02.720 --> 04:06.880
cultures that were at least somewhat more isolationist than the surrounding nomads were.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.600
We keep coming back to isolationism, for all of its flaws, because it's an important step in

04:11.600 --> 04:16.880
cultural development. The idea of individuality arises from isolationism. You know, each person

04:16.880 --> 04:21.360
is a nation unto themself, and all that. The world's greatest religions almost always put

04:21.360 --> 04:26.240
forward a single individual as both a hero and a manifestation of the divine. In Europe,

04:26.240 --> 04:31.280
paradoxically being both packed with people, as well as having a geography that tends towards

04:31.280 --> 04:36.320
isolationist cultures, had the best possible environment for the idea of human individual

04:36.320 --> 04:40.640
rights to come about, after thousands of years anyway. Okay, we're way off topic, but this is

04:40.640 --> 04:45.680
all important stuff. A wide array of conditions, from climate to geographic, generated a culture

04:45.680 --> 04:49.760
in Europe that created individualism and thus kicked off the Enlightenment, which led to our

04:49.760 --> 04:55.040
modern technologically advanced society. And Asia was basically able to tag along, because their own

04:55.040 --> 05:00.000
climate and geography allowed them to get about 80% of the way there on their own anyway. Diseases

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
wiped out the population of the Americas and Australia, because they never had a reason to

05:04.000 --> 05:07.920
gain an immunity to them. And the Middle East and Africa existed in a climate where a booming

05:07.920 --> 05:14.480
advance was basically impossible long term. My first takeaway is, hey, alt-right. It's not race

05:14.480 --> 05:18.720
that caused white people to be a dominant global force. So the ethno-state is an ideal that it

05:18.720 --> 05:23.920
would be a state for all people of the white race. It would be our homeland, it would be our safe

05:23.920 --> 05:28.880
space. My second takeaway is that when idiots like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talk about growing

05:28.880 --> 05:33.520
yucca root in North America because the brown immigrants are somehow intrinsically tied to

05:33.520 --> 05:37.360
the food from their native lands, she sounds like a moron who doesn't understand that race is

05:37.360 --> 05:44.080
separate from agriculture. Our communities are naturally in tune to live in an environmentally

05:44.080 --> 05:53.200
conscious way. When someone says that it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca instead

05:53.200 --> 06:03.200
of, I don't know, cauliflower or something, what you're doing is that you're taking a colonial

06:03.200 --> 06:08.480
approach to environmentalism. You've both got the same ass-backwards blood and soil argument,

06:08.480 --> 06:13.440
and you're both idiots. So Professor Landes spent a great deal of time in his book correlating the

06:13.440 --> 06:17.520
levels of interpersonal trust between your average people and the wealth of the nation,

06:17.520 --> 06:21.840
finding a pretty close correlation. And we also know, thanks to Jared Diamond's work,

06:21.840 --> 06:26.800
that primarily Europe, but to a much lesser extent Asia, eventually created societies with

06:26.800 --> 06:31.200
some concept of individualism, due to many factors not limited to water supply, trade opportunities,

06:31.200 --> 06:36.240
climate, vegetation, and geography. How do these two things piece together? Well, in a society that

06:36.240 --> 06:40.880
values human rights, that enshrines the individual at the core of political thought, there's high

06:40.880 --> 06:46.000
levels of interpersonal trust. Think of it this way, each and every single one of us has a

06:46.000 --> 06:50.720
truckload of problems. Problems with school, problems with our home life, with our girlfriends,

06:50.720 --> 06:56.000
our boyfriends, our family, our kids, our parents, problems with ourself, health problems,

06:56.000 --> 07:01.440
addiction, poverty, you name it, we have it. And any one of those problems could turn us into an

07:01.440 --> 07:08.160
absolute lying, thieving, cheating catastrophe. But they generally don't, all things considered.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.440
Let's say you and I are building a house together. When we make the business deal,

07:11.440 --> 07:16.080
we're accepting that yes, each of us has many reasons to simply ruin the deal,

07:16.080 --> 07:21.200
but we're trusting each other that we won't. When you trust me, you're inviting the best of

07:21.200 --> 07:26.880
me to step forth. And when I trust you, I'm doing the same. And when we both trust each other,

07:26.880 --> 07:31.040
we have time to actually do the work that we've agreed to do. If I don't trust you,

07:31.040 --> 07:35.120
I'm not going to be working on the house, because I don't think you'll be working on the house.

07:35.120 --> 07:39.120
So I'll be micromanaging you, hovering over your shoulder, double checking your work, etc.

07:39.120 --> 07:44.480
But if we both just accept at face value that we're faulty people, and presume we're going to

07:44.480 --> 07:49.760
deal with ourselves as best we can, we can simply get the job done and get paid. This is why the

07:49.760 --> 07:55.520
micromanaging manager at a retail store is almost always the cause of both his worker's malcontent

07:55.520 --> 08:00.160
and the store's long-term failure. This is why eBay wasn't the massive flop that it was

08:00.160 --> 08:04.480
predicted to be. Back when it was new, the general perception was that I would send you garbage and

08:04.480 --> 08:08.960
you would send me a check that I couldn't cash. But that's not what happened. People were actually

08:08.960 --> 08:13.200
honest. And suddenly you have online shopping, something that could have never been invented

08:13.200 --> 08:17.440
in a low-trust society. Just like there's a correlation between high-trust societies and

08:17.440 --> 08:21.520
wealth, there's a correlation between high-trust societies and societies that manage to develop

08:21.520 --> 08:26.720
at least some semblance of human rights, stemming from individuality born from isolationism. The

08:26.720 --> 08:32.480
G7 consists of America, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. All European or Asian

08:32.480 --> 08:36.800
based countries with high levels of trust and respect for human rights. Now this development

08:36.800 --> 08:42.720
of a high-trust society can obviously be disrupted by an outside force. Communism absolutely ruined

08:42.800 --> 08:47.680
China in this regard. It probably could have been there by now without it if Taiwan's any indication.

08:47.680 --> 08:53.280
Totalitarian systems of government, from communism to Nazism to Sharia Islam to all the rest,

08:53.280 --> 08:58.560
all share a tendency to turn high-trust societies into low-trust ones. I can't build the house with

08:58.560 --> 09:03.040
you honestly because I don't know if you're a member of the secret police or a party informant

09:03.040 --> 09:07.920
or if you're here to judge my vices and my virtues. A state that leaves people alone gives

09:07.920 --> 09:12.400
people time to trust their fellow man. It's why the free market works because we're all given a

09:12.640 --> 09:17.600
faith shot at it. It's why democracy works because we're all able to have our say truthfully and

09:17.600 --> 09:22.240
without punishment for going against the grain. And it's also why importing massive numbers of

09:22.240 --> 09:26.640
people from low-trust societies without giving them time to assimilate will destroy us in the

09:26.640 --> 09:31.120
long run. We might think we're being humanitarians but they just view us as suckers. We can judge a

09:31.120 --> 09:35.920
culture by what it produces. And Western culture uniquely produced the best civilization in the

09:35.920 --> 09:39.760
history of our species. It's not because of genetic superiority, though we shouldn't be

09:39.760 --> 09:44.000
ashamed of our genes. It's not because we stole it off the backs of somebody else, though we're

09:44.000 --> 09:48.960
not responsible for our history. It's because our environment cultivated the best way of thinking,

09:48.960 --> 09:54.320
of speaking, of acting in the world. I like living in and being a member of my high-trust society,

09:54.320 --> 09:58.880
thank you very much. I'm not sorry for it. I'm not ashamed of it. And I'm not willing to sacrifice

09:58.880 --> 10:00.800
it on the altar of political correctness.
