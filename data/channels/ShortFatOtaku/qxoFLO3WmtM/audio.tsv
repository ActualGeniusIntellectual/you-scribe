0	5760	During the GameBoomer Shenmue stream, Dave and I talked about why Japan is so rich despite having
5760	10880	a relatively low population and almost no natural resources. Because that was a let's play and not
10880	16080	me actually sitting down and figuring things out, I stumbled all over the topic as I'm apt to do.
16080	19760	So let's actually go over this a little bit. In Professor David Landy's book,
19760	24080	The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, he explores the question of why some nations are rich and
24080	28480	others are not. He basically comes to the conclusion that a variety of factors caused
28480	32800	Europe to be the world's powerhouse. Landy's believed that Protestantism in Northern Europe
32800	37200	drove the population to value hard work, punctuality, free thinking, and the free market
37200	40960	more than Catholic Southern Europe and significantly more than the rest of the world.
40960	46720	Which, while valuing hard work pretty uniformly, almost always dissuaded free thinking. He also
46720	51440	believed in the hydraulic thesis that centrally managed states kept their grip on power through
51440	56400	the use of water control, and in the climate thesis that tropical regions are, all things
56400	60560	considered, harder to develop technologically. But most important to us, he believed that
60560	64640	cultures that were higher in trust were more likely to be wealthy regardless of other factors.
64640	69120	They could be poor in human resources, in natural resources. They could be isolated. It didn't
69120	73120	matter. If the people were able to trust each other, wealth would generate for each person
73120	77520	in proportion to how much work they performed. That does seem to line up with reality. Like I
77520	81920	said, Japan's a nation with basically nothing but rocks in the water, and they're a world economic
81920	86560	powerhouse. Meanwhile, you have places like Venezuela, or Africa, or the Soviet Union.
86560	91360	Natural resources everywhere, but constant corruption, waste, and poverty. It would seem
91360	95520	to me that simply having stuff doesn't automatically make you rich. Another book,
95520	100960	Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond, also has some ideas that mesh quite well here.
100960	105200	It's not hard to figure out that technological advancement is only possible when a society
105200	109680	transitions from hunter-gatherer status to agricultural status. Long-term complex
109680	113760	invention requires that you stay in one place for a long period of time. Staying in one place
113760	118640	requires a surplus of food. A surplus of food requires three things. Animals capable of thriving
118640	123200	in captivity rather than dying off or becoming violent, hearty, high-carbohydrate vegetation
123200	128080	able to be cultivated by farmers, and a dry, cool climate to allow for long-term storage.
128080	133120	So basically, Europe and Asia. However, Europe still had a few more advantages up its sleeve.
133120	137600	China remained a water bureaucracy long after Europe had transitioned to basic feudalism,
137600	142960	because rice requires significantly more water to grow than grain. Most great human civilizations
142960	147440	began due to the ability to control the water for irrigation, like the Egyptians, Indus,
147440	152240	and Mayans. But the climate's always been fickle, and the states that survived stopped revolving so
152240	156880	heavily around water control. Nonetheless, the extra food allowed for both organized religion
156880	162240	and complicated bureaucracy, as society could now afford to feed priests and nobles. Europe and Asia
162240	166880	also had a trade advantage. They were able to transfer food, animals, and goods along the same
166880	171520	latitude, while African and American traders had to trade across climates, limiting their options.
171520	176880	Europeans also cultivated an immunity to disease, from living closely with livestock, to widespread
176880	181760	trade and travel with other ethnic groups, to access to a wider variety of foods. These diseases
181760	186320	would prove devastating in European contact with North America, where it's estimated that most
186320	190880	native death occurred due to disease transmission. But ultimately, it would be Europe that came out
190880	196000	on top due to the geography of the area. There's been many, many attempts to unite Europe under the
196000	201040	same banner. The EU is only the latest one, and they almost always fail because the geography of
201040	205840	Europe lends itself to isolationism. Different languages, ethnicities, and traditions are more
205840	211360	likely to stay separate than join up. The European coastline is jagged and irregular. Islands are
211360	216000	everywhere. There's great mountain ranges and dense forests. Look at how many countries that are in
216000	221120	Europe. There's an equal number of ethnicities in China, but China's almost always had a stronger
221120	226480	cultural impetus towards being a unified nation because 1. the water situation required it to be,
226480	232720	and 2. the landscape's composition of flatlands and rivers made wars of conquest more possible.
232720	237600	In fact, there's even another theory that the three greatest human civilizations to ever exist
237600	242720	flourished around three semi-isolated large bodies of water, leading to both seafood consumption and
242720	246880	cultures that were at least somewhat more isolationist than the surrounding nomads were.
246880	251600	We keep coming back to isolationism, for all of its flaws, because it's an important step in
251600	256880	cultural development. The idea of individuality arises from isolationism. You know, each person
256880	261360	is a nation unto themself, and all that. The world's greatest religions almost always put
261360	266240	forward a single individual as both a hero and a manifestation of the divine. In Europe,
266240	271280	paradoxically being both packed with people, as well as having a geography that tends towards
271280	276320	isolationist cultures, had the best possible environment for the idea of human individual
276320	280640	rights to come about, after thousands of years anyway. Okay, we're way off topic, but this is
280640	285680	all important stuff. A wide array of conditions, from climate to geographic, generated a culture
285680	289760	in Europe that created individualism and thus kicked off the Enlightenment, which led to our
289760	295040	modern technologically advanced society. And Asia was basically able to tag along, because their own
295040	300000	climate and geography allowed them to get about 80% of the way there on their own anyway. Diseases
300000	304000	wiped out the population of the Americas and Australia, because they never had a reason to
304000	307920	gain an immunity to them. And the Middle East and Africa existed in a climate where a booming
307920	314480	advance was basically impossible long term. My first takeaway is, hey, alt-right. It's not race
314480	318720	that caused white people to be a dominant global force. So the ethno-state is an ideal that it
318720	323920	would be a state for all people of the white race. It would be our homeland, it would be our safe
323920	328880	space. My second takeaway is that when idiots like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talk about growing
328880	333520	yucca root in North America because the brown immigrants are somehow intrinsically tied to
333520	337360	the food from their native lands, she sounds like a moron who doesn't understand that race is
337360	344080	separate from agriculture. Our communities are naturally in tune to live in an environmentally
344080	353200	conscious way. When someone says that it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca instead
353200	363200	of, I don't know, cauliflower or something, what you're doing is that you're taking a colonial
363200	368480	approach to environmentalism. You've both got the same ass-backwards blood and soil argument,
368480	373440	and you're both idiots. So Professor Landes spent a great deal of time in his book correlating the
373440	377520	levels of interpersonal trust between your average people and the wealth of the nation,
377520	381840	finding a pretty close correlation. And we also know, thanks to Jared Diamond's work,
381840	386800	that primarily Europe, but to a much lesser extent Asia, eventually created societies with
386800	391200	some concept of individualism, due to many factors not limited to water supply, trade opportunities,
391200	396240	climate, vegetation, and geography. How do these two things piece together? Well, in a society that
396240	400880	values human rights, that enshrines the individual at the core of political thought, there's high
400880	406000	levels of interpersonal trust. Think of it this way, each and every single one of us has a
406000	410720	truckload of problems. Problems with school, problems with our home life, with our girlfriends,
410720	416000	our boyfriends, our family, our kids, our parents, problems with ourself, health problems,
416000	421440	addiction, poverty, you name it, we have it. And any one of those problems could turn us into an
421440	428160	absolute lying, thieving, cheating catastrophe. But they generally don't, all things considered.
428160	431440	Let's say you and I are building a house together. When we make the business deal,
431440	436080	we're accepting that yes, each of us has many reasons to simply ruin the deal,
436080	441200	but we're trusting each other that we won't. When you trust me, you're inviting the best of
441200	446880	me to step forth. And when I trust you, I'm doing the same. And when we both trust each other,
446880	451040	we have time to actually do the work that we've agreed to do. If I don't trust you,
451040	455120	I'm not going to be working on the house, because I don't think you'll be working on the house.
455120	459120	So I'll be micromanaging you, hovering over your shoulder, double checking your work, etc.
459120	464480	But if we both just accept at face value that we're faulty people, and presume we're going to
464480	469760	deal with ourselves as best we can, we can simply get the job done and get paid. This is why the
469760	475520	micromanaging manager at a retail store is almost always the cause of both his worker's malcontent
475520	480160	and the store's long-term failure. This is why eBay wasn't the massive flop that it was
480160	484480	predicted to be. Back when it was new, the general perception was that I would send you garbage and
484480	488960	you would send me a check that I couldn't cash. But that's not what happened. People were actually
488960	493200	honest. And suddenly you have online shopping, something that could have never been invented
493200	497440	in a low-trust society. Just like there's a correlation between high-trust societies and
497440	501520	wealth, there's a correlation between high-trust societies and societies that manage to develop
501520	506720	at least some semblance of human rights, stemming from individuality born from isolationism. The
506720	512480	G7 consists of America, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. All European or Asian
512480	516800	based countries with high levels of trust and respect for human rights. Now this development
516800	522720	of a high-trust society can obviously be disrupted by an outside force. Communism absolutely ruined
522800	527680	China in this regard. It probably could have been there by now without it if Taiwan's any indication.
527680	533280	Totalitarian systems of government, from communism to Nazism to Sharia Islam to all the rest,
533280	538560	all share a tendency to turn high-trust societies into low-trust ones. I can't build the house with
538560	543040	you honestly because I don't know if you're a member of the secret police or a party informant
543040	547920	or if you're here to judge my vices and my virtues. A state that leaves people alone gives
547920	552400	people time to trust their fellow man. It's why the free market works because we're all given a
552640	557600	faith shot at it. It's why democracy works because we're all able to have our say truthfully and
557600	562240	without punishment for going against the grain. And it's also why importing massive numbers of
562240	566640	people from low-trust societies without giving them time to assimilate will destroy us in the
566640	571120	long run. We might think we're being humanitarians but they just view us as suckers. We can judge a
571120	575920	culture by what it produces. And Western culture uniquely produced the best civilization in the
575920	579760	history of our species. It's not because of genetic superiority, though we shouldn't be
579760	584000	ashamed of our genes. It's not because we stole it off the backs of somebody else, though we're
584000	588960	not responsible for our history. It's because our environment cultivated the best way of thinking,
588960	594320	of speaking, of acting in the world. I like living in and being a member of my high-trust society,
594320	598880	thank you very much. I'm not sorry for it. I'm not ashamed of it. And I'm not willing to sacrifice
598880	600800	it on the altar of political correctness.
