00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
So here's a non-story that I missed while I was out of the office.

00:03.440 --> 00:07.840
Apparently, due to the government shutdown, Trump paid out of pocket for a giant spread

00:07.840 --> 00:08.840
of fast food.

00:08.840 --> 00:09.840
What's your favorite food here?

00:09.840 --> 00:10.840
I like it all.

00:10.840 --> 00:11.840
I like it all.

00:11.840 --> 00:12.840
It's all good stuff.

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
Great American food.

00:13.840 --> 00:22.840
And it will be very interesting to see at the end of this evening how many are left.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.840
Do you prefer McDonald's or Wendy's?

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
I like them all.

00:25.840 --> 00:26.840
That's a tough question.

00:26.840 --> 00:27.840
If it's American, I like it.

00:27.840 --> 00:28.840
It's all American stuff.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.460
So, but it's good stuff.

00:32.460 --> 00:39.400
We have the national champion team, as you know, Clemson Tigers, and they had a fantastic

00:39.400 --> 00:41.760
game against Alabama.

00:41.760 --> 00:42.760
And they're all here.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.760
They're right outside the room.

00:44.760 --> 00:49.840
And I think we're going to let you see them, but I'll bet you as much food as we have.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.840
We have pizzas.

00:50.840 --> 00:56.520
We have 300 hamburgers, many, many French fries, all of our favorite foods.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.080
I want to see what's here when we leave, because I don't think it's going to be

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
much.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.640
The reason we did this is because of the shutdown.

01:03.640 --> 01:07.280
When this year's national college football champions showed up to the White House for

01:07.280 --> 01:10.840
the winner's dinner, they were met with Big Macs, fries, and pizzas.

01:10.840 --> 01:14.760
Now, maybe to those kids who worked their asses off to become the champs, they expected

01:14.760 --> 01:16.800
something that wasn't just fast food.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.880
Or maybe they've been on strict diets and training for so long that a plate of fast

01:20.880 --> 01:22.160
food will really hit the spot.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
I don't know.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.000
But I know who did get pissed off.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.080
The media.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.120
Just so we're clear, guys, this is why the people hate the media.

01:30.120 --> 01:34.120
Trump stoking the fires with constant calls of fake news doesn't help, of course.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.360
But your reaction to this photo shows you to be the upper class twats that you claim

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
to hate.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.260
The idea that cheap food could ever possibly mix with expensive dishware is a real affront

01:43.260 --> 01:44.400
to you, isn't it?

01:44.400 --> 01:48.480
None of these articles would ever dare say it, but you can feel the subtext.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.760
How dare Trump denigrate the presidency and the White House with something as low class

01:52.760 --> 01:54.240
as fast food?

01:54.240 --> 01:58.480
The problem is, and this is something that the fat cats in the media don't understand,

01:58.480 --> 02:02.320
is that poor people don't actually eat fast food all that regularly.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.800
It's just too expensive for them, believe it or not.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.760
It's like the weekly treat they'll pick up on Friday night after a shitty work week or

02:08.760 --> 02:09.760
something.

02:09.760 --> 02:13.560
Fast food is the poor man's version of dressing up and going out to a nice restaurant every

02:13.560 --> 02:14.760
once in a while.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.840
That's why, while you see this picture as a grave offense, the average working Joe sees

02:18.840 --> 02:20.560
it as a good fucking time.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.200
They see it as an indulgence, as a once in a lifetime opportunity.

02:24.200 --> 02:29.000
I know that you would see lobster or caviar or oysters or whatever the fuck rich people

02:29.000 --> 02:33.920
eat as indulgence, but that stuff is so far out of the realm of possibility for America's

02:33.920 --> 02:37.040
working poor that they just wouldn't viscerally get it.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.520
But a platter of Big Macs?

02:38.520 --> 02:39.520
They get that.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.460
And this isn't about the football champions and it's not even about the media.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.440
It's about Trump appealing to Trump's base.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.600
Tell a member of the working poor that Trump brought in, say, 300 lobsters.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.800
And they'll get it, but tell them that Trump brought in 300 Big Macs and they'll

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
really get it.

02:53.800 --> 02:58.900
I think on some level the media does understand this, which is why they fell back on nitpicking

02:58.900 --> 03:00.720
the whole enterprise to death.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.700
Supreme Leader Donald Trump lies about volume of fast food hamburgers.

03:04.700 --> 03:08.560
President Trump claims Clemerson ate over 1,000 burgers at the White House.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.840
President Trump's extravagant $3,000, 300 sandwich celebration.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.000
Man, does it even matter that much?

03:15.000 --> 03:19.580
The only reason this is even worth talking about is because how you guys constantly self-destruct

03:19.580 --> 03:21.720
over every single one of Trump's actions.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.680
Like, keep in mind, this video isn't about Trump buying fast food for the dinner.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.160
It's about how everybody inexplicably lost their mind over Trump buying fast food for

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
the dinner.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.240
But here's the most important part.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.440
Remember, this happened due to the government shutdown.

03:34.440 --> 03:39.400
As stated in the BBC article, an estimated 800,000 public sector workers, including White

03:39.400 --> 03:43.880
House residents' staff, have been on mandatory leave or working without pay for a record

03:43.880 --> 03:44.960
24 days.

03:44.960 --> 03:49.560
President Trump is refusing to approve a federal budget unless it includes funds for a wall

03:49.560 --> 03:54.280
among the Mexican border, but Democrats have rejected his request for $5.7 billion.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.320
This is something that, frankly, everybody should have seen coming.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.680
Around this time last year, Trump tweeted that it would be the last time he approved

04:00.680 --> 04:02.320
a budget without funds for the wall.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.520
Maybe establishment politicians are somehow still shocked that Trump actually sticks to

04:06.520 --> 04:07.520
his guns?

04:07.520 --> 04:10.560
He's been doing it since before he got elected, maybe they should have figured it out by now.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.560
I still maintain that the Democrats can use this opportunity to strike a deal.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.740
Leave Trump the wall in exchange for Obamacare or something.

04:17.740 --> 04:21.280
But instead, they'd rather throw temper tantrums and be obstructionists.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.680
And this is where that's led us.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.880
Best part is, though, Nancy Pelosi's trip got yanked out from under her due to the party's

04:26.880 --> 04:28.560
unwillingness to hammer out an agreement.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.040
Due to the shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt and

04:32.040 --> 04:33.820
Afghanistan has been postponed.

04:33.820 --> 04:37.280
We will reschedule this 7-day excursion when the shutdown is over.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.520
In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I'm sure you would agree

04:41.520 --> 04:44.460
that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.

04:44.460 --> 04:48.220
I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington

04:48.220 --> 04:52.780
negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown.

04:52.780 --> 04:55.900
Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly

04:55.900 --> 04:57.100
be your prerogative.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.080
I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous

05:01.080 --> 05:06.540
southern border finally receive the attention, funding and security it so desperately deserves.

05:06.540 --> 05:11.300
Translation, you don't get to jet-set on the taxpayer's dime until you actually start

05:11.300 --> 05:14.700
doing your job and work out an agreement with the rest of us.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.180
Get fucked.
