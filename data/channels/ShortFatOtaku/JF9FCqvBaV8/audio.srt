1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
So here's a non-story that I missed while I was out of the office.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,840
Apparently, due to the government shutdown, Trump paid out of pocket for a giant spread

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,840
of fast food.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
What's your favorite food here?

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
I like it all.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
I like it all.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,840
It's all good stuff.

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
Great American food.

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:22,840
And it will be very interesting to see at the end of this evening how many are left.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Do you prefer McDonald's or Wendy's?

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
I like them all.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
That's a tough question.

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,840
If it's American, I like it.

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
It's all American stuff.

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,460
So, but it's good stuff.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,400
We have the national champion team, as you know, Clemson Tigers, and they had a fantastic

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,760
game against Alabama.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
And they're all here.

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,760
They're right outside the room.

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,840
And I think we're going to let you see them, but I'll bet you as much food as we have.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
We have pizzas.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,520
We have 300 hamburgers, many, many French fries, all of our favorite foods.

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,080
I want to see what's here when we leave, because I don't think it's going to be

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
much.

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,640
The reason we did this is because of the shutdown.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,280
When this year's national college football champions showed up to the White House for

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,840
the winner's dinner, they were met with Big Macs, fries, and pizzas.

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,760
Now, maybe to those kids who worked their asses off to become the champs, they expected

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,800
something that wasn't just fast food.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,880
Or maybe they've been on strict diets and training for so long that a plate of fast

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,160
food will really hit the spot.

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
I don't know.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,000
But I know who did get pissed off.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,080
The media.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,120
Just so we're clear, guys, this is why the people hate the media.

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Trump stoking the fires with constant calls of fake news doesn't help, of course.

37
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,360
But your reaction to this photo shows you to be the upper class twats that you claim

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
to hate.

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,260
The idea that cheap food could ever possibly mix with expensive dishware is a real affront

40
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,400
to you, isn't it?

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,480
None of these articles would ever dare say it, but you can feel the subtext.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,760
How dare Trump denigrate the presidency and the White House with something as low class

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,240
as fast food?

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,480
The problem is, and this is something that the fat cats in the media don't understand,

45
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,320
is that poor people don't actually eat fast food all that regularly.

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,800
It's just too expensive for them, believe it or not.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,760
It's like the weekly treat they'll pick up on Friday night after a shitty work week or

48
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
something.

49
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,560
Fast food is the poor man's version of dressing up and going out to a nice restaurant every

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,760
once in a while.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,840
That's why, while you see this picture as a grave offense, the average working Joe sees

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
it as a good fucking time.

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,200
They see it as an indulgence, as a once in a lifetime opportunity.

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,000
I know that you would see lobster or caviar or oysters or whatever the fuck rich people

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,920
eat as indulgence, but that stuff is so far out of the realm of possibility for America's

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,040
working poor that they just wouldn't viscerally get it.

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,520
But a platter of Big Macs?

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
They get that.

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,460
And this isn't about the football champions and it's not even about the media.

60
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,440
It's about Trump appealing to Trump's base.

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,600
Tell a member of the working poor that Trump brought in, say, 300 lobsters.

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,800
And they'll get it, but tell them that Trump brought in 300 Big Macs and they'll

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
really get it.

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,900
I think on some level the media does understand this, which is why they fell back on nitpicking

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,720
the whole enterprise to death.

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,700
Supreme Leader Donald Trump lies about volume of fast food hamburgers.

67
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,560
President Trump claims Clemerson ate over 1,000 burgers at the White House.

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,840
President Trump's extravagant $3,000, 300 sandwich celebration.

69
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,000
Man, does it even matter that much?

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,580
The only reason this is even worth talking about is because how you guys constantly self-destruct

71
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,720
over every single one of Trump's actions.

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,680
Like, keep in mind, this video isn't about Trump buying fast food for the dinner.

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,160
It's about how everybody inexplicably lost their mind over Trump buying fast food for

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
the dinner.

75
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,240
But here's the most important part.

76
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,440
Remember, this happened due to the government shutdown.

77
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,400
As stated in the BBC article, an estimated 800,000 public sector workers, including White

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,880
House residents' staff, have been on mandatory leave or working without pay for a record

79
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,960
24 days.

80
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,560
President Trump is refusing to approve a federal budget unless it includes funds for a wall

81
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,280
among the Mexican border, but Democrats have rejected his request for $5.7 billion.

82
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,320
This is something that, frankly, everybody should have seen coming.

83
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,680
Around this time last year, Trump tweeted that it would be the last time he approved

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,320
a budget without funds for the wall.

85
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,520
Maybe establishment politicians are somehow still shocked that Trump actually sticks to

86
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
his guns?

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,560
He's been doing it since before he got elected, maybe they should have figured it out by now.

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I still maintain that the Democrats can use this opportunity to strike a deal.

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,740
Leave Trump the wall in exchange for Obamacare or something.

90
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,280
But instead, they'd rather throw temper tantrums and be obstructionists.

91
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,680
And this is where that's led us.

92
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,880
Best part is, though, Nancy Pelosi's trip got yanked out from under her due to the party's

93
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
unwillingness to hammer out an agreement.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,040
Due to the shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt and

95
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,820
Afghanistan has been postponed.

96
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,280
We will reschedule this 7-day excursion when the shutdown is over.

97
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,520
In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I'm sure you would agree

98
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,460
that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.

99
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,220
I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington

100
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,780
negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown.

101
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,900
Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly

102
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,100
be your prerogative.

103
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,080
I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous

104
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,540
southern border finally receive the attention, funding and security it so desperately deserves.

105
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,300
Translation, you don't get to jet-set on the taxpayer's dime until you actually start

106
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,700
doing your job and work out an agreement with the rest of us.

107
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,180
Get fucked.
