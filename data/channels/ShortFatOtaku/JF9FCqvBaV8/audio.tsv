0	3440	So here's a non-story that I missed while I was out of the office.
3440	7840	Apparently, due to the government shutdown, Trump paid out of pocket for a giant spread
7840	8840	of fast food.
8840	9840	What's your favorite food here?
9840	10840	I like it all.
10840	11840	I like it all.
11840	12840	It's all good stuff.
12840	13840	Great American food.
13840	22840	And it will be very interesting to see at the end of this evening how many are left.
22840	24840	Do you prefer McDonald's or Wendy's?
24840	25840	I like them all.
25840	26840	That's a tough question.
26840	27840	If it's American, I like it.
27840	28840	It's all American stuff.
29680	32460	So, but it's good stuff.
32460	39400	We have the national champion team, as you know, Clemson Tigers, and they had a fantastic
39400	41760	game against Alabama.
41760	42760	And they're all here.
42760	44760	They're right outside the room.
44760	49840	And I think we're going to let you see them, but I'll bet you as much food as we have.
49840	50840	We have pizzas.
50840	56520	We have 300 hamburgers, many, many French fries, all of our favorite foods.
56520	60080	I want to see what's here when we leave, because I don't think it's going to be
60080	61080	much.
61080	63640	The reason we did this is because of the shutdown.
63640	67280	When this year's national college football champions showed up to the White House for
67280	70840	the winner's dinner, they were met with Big Macs, fries, and pizzas.
70840	74760	Now, maybe to those kids who worked their asses off to become the champs, they expected
74760	76800	something that wasn't just fast food.
76800	80880	Or maybe they've been on strict diets and training for so long that a plate of fast
80880	82160	food will really hit the spot.
82160	83160	I don't know.
83160	85000	But I know who did get pissed off.
85000	86080	The media.
86080	90120	Just so we're clear, guys, this is why the people hate the media.
90120	94120	Trump stoking the fires with constant calls of fake news doesn't help, of course.
94120	98360	But your reaction to this photo shows you to be the upper class twats that you claim
98360	99360	to hate.
99360	103260	The idea that cheap food could ever possibly mix with expensive dishware is a real affront
103260	104400	to you, isn't it?
104400	108480	None of these articles would ever dare say it, but you can feel the subtext.
108480	112760	How dare Trump denigrate the presidency and the White House with something as low class
112760	114240	as fast food?
114240	118480	The problem is, and this is something that the fat cats in the media don't understand,
118480	122320	is that poor people don't actually eat fast food all that regularly.
122320	124800	It's just too expensive for them, believe it or not.
124800	128760	It's like the weekly treat they'll pick up on Friday night after a shitty work week or
128760	129760	something.
129760	133560	Fast food is the poor man's version of dressing up and going out to a nice restaurant every
133560	134760	once in a while.
134760	138840	That's why, while you see this picture as a grave offense, the average working Joe sees
138840	140560	it as a good fucking time.
140560	144200	They see it as an indulgence, as a once in a lifetime opportunity.
144200	149000	I know that you would see lobster or caviar or oysters or whatever the fuck rich people
149000	153920	eat as indulgence, but that stuff is so far out of the realm of possibility for America's
153920	157040	working poor that they just wouldn't viscerally get it.
157040	158520	But a platter of Big Macs?
158520	159520	They get that.
159520	162460	And this isn't about the football champions and it's not even about the media.
162460	164440	It's about Trump appealing to Trump's base.
164440	168600	Tell a member of the working poor that Trump brought in, say, 300 lobsters.
168600	172800	And they'll get it, but tell them that Trump brought in 300 Big Macs and they'll
172800	173800	really get it.
173800	178900	I think on some level the media does understand this, which is why they fell back on nitpicking
178900	180720	the whole enterprise to death.
180720	184700	Supreme Leader Donald Trump lies about volume of fast food hamburgers.
184700	188560	President Trump claims Clemerson ate over 1,000 burgers at the White House.
188560	192840	President Trump's extravagant $3,000, 300 sandwich celebration.
192840	195000	Man, does it even matter that much?
195000	199580	The only reason this is even worth talking about is because how you guys constantly self-destruct
199580	201720	over every single one of Trump's actions.
201720	205680	Like, keep in mind, this video isn't about Trump buying fast food for the dinner.
205680	210160	It's about how everybody inexplicably lost their mind over Trump buying fast food for
210160	211160	the dinner.
211160	212240	But here's the most important part.
212240	214440	Remember, this happened due to the government shutdown.
214440	219400	As stated in the BBC article, an estimated 800,000 public sector workers, including White
219400	223880	House residents' staff, have been on mandatory leave or working without pay for a record
223880	224960	24 days.
224960	229560	President Trump is refusing to approve a federal budget unless it includes funds for a wall
229560	234280	among the Mexican border, but Democrats have rejected his request for $5.7 billion.
234280	237320	This is something that, frankly, everybody should have seen coming.
237320	240680	Around this time last year, Trump tweeted that it would be the last time he approved
240680	242320	a budget without funds for the wall.
242320	246520	Maybe establishment politicians are somehow still shocked that Trump actually sticks to
246520	247520	his guns?
247520	250560	He's been doing it since before he got elected, maybe they should have figured it out by now.
250560	254560	I still maintain that the Democrats can use this opportunity to strike a deal.
254560	257740	Leave Trump the wall in exchange for Obamacare or something.
257740	261280	But instead, they'd rather throw temper tantrums and be obstructionists.
261280	262680	And this is where that's led us.
262680	266880	Best part is, though, Nancy Pelosi's trip got yanked out from under her due to the party's
266880	268560	unwillingness to hammer out an agreement.
268560	272040	Due to the shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt and
272040	273820	Afghanistan has been postponed.
273820	277280	We will reschedule this 7-day excursion when the shutdown is over.
277280	281520	In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I'm sure you would agree
281520	284460	that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.
284460	288220	I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington
288220	292780	negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown.
292780	295900	Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly
295900	297100	be your prerogative.
297100	301080	I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous
301080	306540	southern border finally receive the attention, funding and security it so desperately deserves.
306540	311300	Translation, you don't get to jet-set on the taxpayer's dime until you actually start
311300	314700	doing your job and work out an agreement with the rest of us.
314700	315180	Get fucked.
