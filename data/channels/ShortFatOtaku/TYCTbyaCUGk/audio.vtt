00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
So while my channel was offline, the 2018 Game Awards happened. I streamed it live with my

00:05.440 --> 00:10.160
roommate on my Twitch channel, which I did keep up and running during the two weeks that I was

00:10.160 --> 00:14.480
tack feared off YouTube. That stream is up on my archive channel, by the way, along with all the

00:14.480 --> 00:19.280
others. At this point, though, I'm sure we've all seen this segment of the awards.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.800
Sonic Fox won Best Esports Player of the Year, and good on him. But he spent his time on stage

00:42.800 --> 00:48.920
in his fur suit, mumbling into the microphone about how being a black gay furry made him the

00:48.920 --> 01:08.600
enemy of all things Republican. I love watching the Game Awards. Jeff, I know you try really,

01:08.600 --> 01:13.240
really hard to run a serious show, but something always seems to go off the rails every single

01:13.240 --> 01:17.880
time. But let's go beyond just laughing at this clown for the absurd display he put on.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.280
It really seems like progressive journalists wanted to make this guy a hill to die on.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.880
A black furry video gamer just won the world title, and instantly came out as gay. Came out

01:27.880 --> 01:32.360
as gay, like he hasn't been screeching about this as the only thing relevant to his personality,

01:32.360 --> 01:35.880
and that's where we get to the problem. Quick, without looking it up, can you remember what

01:35.880 --> 01:41.640
game Sonic Fox plays, or the specifics of how he plays it? I can't. I watched the awards live.

01:41.640 --> 01:46.360
Hell, I rewatched it in making this video, and I still can't put my finger on it. But do I know

01:46.360 --> 01:53.160
that Sonic Fox is black, is gay, is a furry? You bet. Believe it or not, I'm actually a minority

01:53.160 --> 01:57.560
myself in a few ways. I don't bring it up constantly because they're usually not relevant

01:57.560 --> 02:02.280
to the situation, but also because I'd like to believe I have a more interesting personality

02:02.280 --> 02:07.560
than the boxes I can check off on the progressive stack. Your identity, your demographic, is not a

02:07.560 --> 02:12.600
substitute for having a personality. What you are is never going to be as important as who you are.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.680
The traits you were born with are never going to be as important as the choices you make.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.600
Imagine having all of those developmental years to shape a personality, and when you come out of

02:20.600 --> 02:25.160
it as an adult, all you can muster is, I like sex with the partners of my choice. This is why

02:25.160 --> 02:29.640
anybody with a brain makes fun of all those ridiculous social media bios that are loaded

02:29.640 --> 02:34.680
with pronouns and proclivities. The bio isn't actually saying anything, it's simply showing

02:34.680 --> 02:39.080
the person to be so boring and underdeveloped that they believe membership within a race,

02:39.080 --> 02:43.320
or a gender, or a class of people counts as being a fully-fledged individual.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.240
I think this is why the progressives became enraged beyond comprehension

02:47.240 --> 02:52.280
back during the height of the NPC meme. It was a great shorthand way of describing the commonplace

02:52.280 --> 02:57.000
habit of substituting an actual personality for describing one's place on the identity politics

02:57.000 --> 03:01.560
hierarchy. But the choice not to cultivate a personality by these people isn't benign,

03:01.560 --> 03:06.440
it's effects don't end with them. This is just some armchair psychology, but I think a lot of

03:06.440 --> 03:11.240
them know and feel their deficiencies deep down, without really understanding what to do about it.

03:11.240 --> 03:16.040
That's why, whenever you dig into the past of any of these people, you almost invariably find

03:16.040 --> 03:22.200
violence and rage, or at least, the advocacy for it. Like Sonic Fox himself, his identity is black

03:22.200 --> 03:27.320
gay furry that Republicans hate, and his personality is support social justice men who

03:27.320 --> 03:32.120
attack pro-life women without provocation. Maybe if he focused less on identity and more on

03:32.120 --> 03:36.280
personality, he wouldn't feel the need to cheer on a public assault. But rather than do the hard

03:36.280 --> 03:40.120
work of journeying inside of themselves and making the attempt to find out just what the hell is

03:40.120 --> 03:44.760
wrong with them, the progressives would rather double down. This gay black furry is esports

03:44.760 --> 03:49.400
player of the year, and he's teaching the far-right a lesson. What's the lesson? That people who rely

03:49.400 --> 03:54.360
on the superficial qualities of themselves are themselves superficial people? Ian Miles-Chung

03:54.360 --> 03:59.400
and fellow right-wing YouTuber Jeremy the Quartering Hambley quickly tried to smear Sonic Fox

03:59.400 --> 04:04.600
by claiming he thinks it's cool to assault women after he enjoyed a video of a pro-life camerawoman

04:04.600 --> 04:08.520
accidentally getting punched by a pro-choice activist. And this is how I know the author of

04:08.520 --> 04:13.720
this article, Anna Valens, probably has the same identity personality problems. You have to be

04:13.720 --> 04:18.920
willfully blind to make that many mistakes. Ian and Jeremy aren't right-wing. They're not claiming

04:18.920 --> 04:23.800
anything about Sonic Fox. Sonic Fox said it himself in his tweet. The woman in the video was clearly

04:23.800 --> 04:40.440
not punched, and even more clearly, it was not an accident. In any case, despite Sonic Fox's

04:40.440 --> 04:45.240
appearance at the Game Awards, as well as the show being generally more inclusive than ever before,

04:45.240 --> 04:50.840
SJWs on Twitter still weren't happy. Jeff tweeted, gaming has been marginalized and dismissed for

04:50.840 --> 04:56.920
far too long. Dirtbag Boyfriend tweeted in reply, marginalized and dismissed. This is what happens

04:56.920 --> 05:01.880
when we educate our oppressors. They use our language as a shield. I don't know what Jeff

05:01.880 --> 05:07.560
is posturing about, but people like him terrify me. White cis men nerds adopting the language

05:07.560 --> 05:12.760
of the oppressed would be ridiculous if it weren't so pervasive. And let me take a guess at what this

05:12.760 --> 05:18.440
Dirtbag Boyfriend's profile looks like. Yeah, exactly the type of garbage account I thought.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.520
Also, I'm blocked by him, and I've never even spoken to him before. I'm not surprised.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.320
I can recall during a previous Christmas season meeting up with a cousin of mine who had just

05:27.320 --> 05:32.680
had kids. I asked her how she was, and I shit you not, she said, oh my kids are fine, and then

05:32.680 --> 05:37.160
launched into a lengthy description of what all of her kids were currently doing. She didn't say

05:37.160 --> 05:43.400
I'm fine, she didn't say I'm fine and my kids are fine, not a single peep about herself. I

05:43.400 --> 05:47.960
understand having kids is a big deal, but if you have no time for yourself, if you allow your

05:48.040 --> 05:52.760
personality to be completely subsumed by your identity, it's not healthy for you,

05:52.760 --> 05:56.120
and it's not healthy for the kids. It's the same with social justice.

05:56.120 --> 06:00.840
If you were to ask somebody you know, tell me three of your personality traits, and their first

06:00.840 --> 06:05.800
three go-tos were black, gay, and furry, you may want to sit down and have a serious discussion

06:05.800 --> 06:10.520
with them about where their life is heading. Not because being black, gay, or a furry is bad,

06:10.520 --> 06:15.160
it's not. But because being the type of person that believes identity markers substitute for

06:15.160 --> 06:18.840
a well-developed personality is not only bad, it's self-destructive.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.960
I would hope that that was true.
