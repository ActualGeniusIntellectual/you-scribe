00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
So while my channel was offline, the 2018 Game Awards happened. I streamed it live with my

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,160
roommate on my Twitch channel, which I did keep up and running during the two weeks that I was

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,480
tack feared off YouTube. That stream is up on my archive channel, by the way, along with all the

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,280
others. At this point, though, I'm sure we've all seen this segment of the awards.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Sonic Fox won Best Esports Player of the Year, and good on him. But he spent his time on stage

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,920
in his fur suit, mumbling into the microphone about how being a black gay furry made him the

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:01:08,600
enemy of all things Republican. I love watching the Game Awards. Jeff, I know you try really,

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,240
really hard to run a serious show, but something always seems to go off the rails every single

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,880
time. But let's go beyond just laughing at this clown for the absurd display he put on.

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,280
It really seems like progressive journalists wanted to make this guy a hill to die on.

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,880
A black furry video gamer just won the world title, and instantly came out as gay. Came out

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,360
as gay, like he hasn't been screeching about this as the only thing relevant to his personality,

13
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,880
and that's where we get to the problem. Quick, without looking it up, can you remember what

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,640
game Sonic Fox plays, or the specifics of how he plays it? I can't. I watched the awards live.

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,360
Hell, I rewatched it in making this video, and I still can't put my finger on it. But do I know

16
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,160
that Sonic Fox is black, is gay, is a furry? You bet. Believe it or not, I'm actually a minority

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,560
myself in a few ways. I don't bring it up constantly because they're usually not relevant

18
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,280
to the situation, but also because I'd like to believe I have a more interesting personality

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,560
than the boxes I can check off on the progressive stack. Your identity, your demographic, is not a

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,600
substitute for having a personality. What you are is never going to be as important as who you are.

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,680
The traits you were born with are never going to be as important as the choices you make.

22
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,600
Imagine having all of those developmental years to shape a personality, and when you come out of

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,160
it as an adult, all you can muster is, I like sex with the partners of my choice. This is why

24
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,640
anybody with a brain makes fun of all those ridiculous social media bios that are loaded

25
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,680
with pronouns and proclivities. The bio isn't actually saying anything, it's simply showing

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,080
the person to be so boring and underdeveloped that they believe membership within a race,

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,320
or a gender, or a class of people counts as being a fully-fledged individual.

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,240
I think this is why the progressives became enraged beyond comprehension

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,280
back during the height of the NPC meme. It was a great shorthand way of describing the commonplace

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,000
habit of substituting an actual personality for describing one's place on the identity politics

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,560
hierarchy. But the choice not to cultivate a personality by these people isn't benign,

32
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,440
it's effects don't end with them. This is just some armchair psychology, but I think a lot of

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,240
them know and feel their deficiencies deep down, without really understanding what to do about it.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,040
That's why, whenever you dig into the past of any of these people, you almost invariably find

35
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,200
violence and rage, or at least, the advocacy for it. Like Sonic Fox himself, his identity is black

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,320
gay furry that Republicans hate, and his personality is support social justice men who

37
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,120
attack pro-life women without provocation. Maybe if he focused less on identity and more on

38
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,280
personality, he wouldn't feel the need to cheer on a public assault. But rather than do the hard

39
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,120
work of journeying inside of themselves and making the attempt to find out just what the hell is

40
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,760
wrong with them, the progressives would rather double down. This gay black furry is esports

41
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,400
player of the year, and he's teaching the far-right a lesson. What's the lesson? That people who rely

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,360
on the superficial qualities of themselves are themselves superficial people? Ian Miles-Chung

43
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,400
and fellow right-wing YouTuber Jeremy the Quartering Hambley quickly tried to smear Sonic Fox

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,600
by claiming he thinks it's cool to assault women after he enjoyed a video of a pro-life camerawoman

45
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,520
accidentally getting punched by a pro-choice activist. And this is how I know the author of

46
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,720
this article, Anna Valens, probably has the same identity personality problems. You have to be

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,920
willfully blind to make that many mistakes. Ian and Jeremy aren't right-wing. They're not claiming

48
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,800
anything about Sonic Fox. Sonic Fox said it himself in his tweet. The woman in the video was clearly

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:40,440
not punched, and even more clearly, it was not an accident. In any case, despite Sonic Fox's

50
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,240
appearance at the Game Awards, as well as the show being generally more inclusive than ever before,

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,840
SJWs on Twitter still weren't happy. Jeff tweeted, gaming has been marginalized and dismissed for

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,920
far too long. Dirtbag Boyfriend tweeted in reply, marginalized and dismissed. This is what happens

53
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,880
when we educate our oppressors. They use our language as a shield. I don't know what Jeff

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,560
is posturing about, but people like him terrify me. White cis men nerds adopting the language

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,760
of the oppressed would be ridiculous if it weren't so pervasive. And let me take a guess at what this

56
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,440
Dirtbag Boyfriend's profile looks like. Yeah, exactly the type of garbage account I thought.

57
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,520
Also, I'm blocked by him, and I've never even spoken to him before. I'm not surprised.

58
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,320
I can recall during a previous Christmas season meeting up with a cousin of mine who had just

59
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,680
had kids. I asked her how she was, and I shit you not, she said, oh my kids are fine, and then

60
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,160
launched into a lengthy description of what all of her kids were currently doing. She didn't say

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm fine, she didn't say I'm fine and my kids are fine, not a single peep about herself. I

62
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,960
understand having kids is a big deal, but if you have no time for yourself, if you allow your

63
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,760
personality to be completely subsumed by your identity, it's not healthy for you,

64
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,120
and it's not healthy for the kids. It's the same with social justice.

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,840
If you were to ask somebody you know, tell me three of your personality traits, and their first

66
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,800
three go-tos were black, gay, and furry, you may want to sit down and have a serious discussion

67
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,520
with them about where their life is heading. Not because being black, gay, or a furry is bad,

68
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,160
it's not. But because being the type of person that believes identity markers substitute for

69
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,840
a well-developed personality is not only bad, it's self-destructive.

70
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,960
I would hope that that was true.
