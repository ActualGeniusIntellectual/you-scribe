0	5440	So while my channel was offline, the 2018 Game Awards happened. I streamed it live with my
5440	10160	roommate on my Twitch channel, which I did keep up and running during the two weeks that I was
10160	14480	tack feared off YouTube. That stream is up on my archive channel, by the way, along with all the
14480	19280	others. At this point, though, I'm sure we've all seen this segment of the awards.
30000	42800	Sonic Fox won Best Esports Player of the Year, and good on him. But he spent his time on stage
42800	48920	in his fur suit, mumbling into the microphone about how being a black gay furry made him the
48920	68600	enemy of all things Republican. I love watching the Game Awards. Jeff, I know you try really,
68600	73240	really hard to run a serious show, but something always seems to go off the rails every single
73240	77880	time. But let's go beyond just laughing at this clown for the absurd display he put on.
77880	82280	It really seems like progressive journalists wanted to make this guy a hill to die on.
82280	87880	A black furry video gamer just won the world title, and instantly came out as gay. Came out
87880	92360	as gay, like he hasn't been screeching about this as the only thing relevant to his personality,
92360	95880	and that's where we get to the problem. Quick, without looking it up, can you remember what
95880	101640	game Sonic Fox plays, or the specifics of how he plays it? I can't. I watched the awards live.
101640	106360	Hell, I rewatched it in making this video, and I still can't put my finger on it. But do I know
106360	113160	that Sonic Fox is black, is gay, is a furry? You bet. Believe it or not, I'm actually a minority
113160	117560	myself in a few ways. I don't bring it up constantly because they're usually not relevant
117560	122280	to the situation, but also because I'd like to believe I have a more interesting personality
122280	127560	than the boxes I can check off on the progressive stack. Your identity, your demographic, is not a
127560	132600	substitute for having a personality. What you are is never going to be as important as who you are.
132600	136680	The traits you were born with are never going to be as important as the choices you make.
136680	140600	Imagine having all of those developmental years to shape a personality, and when you come out of
140600	145160	it as an adult, all you can muster is, I like sex with the partners of my choice. This is why
145160	149640	anybody with a brain makes fun of all those ridiculous social media bios that are loaded
149640	154680	with pronouns and proclivities. The bio isn't actually saying anything, it's simply showing
154680	159080	the person to be so boring and underdeveloped that they believe membership within a race,
159080	163320	or a gender, or a class of people counts as being a fully-fledged individual.
163320	167240	I think this is why the progressives became enraged beyond comprehension
167240	172280	back during the height of the NPC meme. It was a great shorthand way of describing the commonplace
172280	177000	habit of substituting an actual personality for describing one's place on the identity politics
177000	181560	hierarchy. But the choice not to cultivate a personality by these people isn't benign,
181560	186440	it's effects don't end with them. This is just some armchair psychology, but I think a lot of
186440	191240	them know and feel their deficiencies deep down, without really understanding what to do about it.
191240	196040	That's why, whenever you dig into the past of any of these people, you almost invariably find
196040	202200	violence and rage, or at least, the advocacy for it. Like Sonic Fox himself, his identity is black
202200	207320	gay furry that Republicans hate, and his personality is support social justice men who
207320	212120	attack pro-life women without provocation. Maybe if he focused less on identity and more on
212120	216280	personality, he wouldn't feel the need to cheer on a public assault. But rather than do the hard
216280	220120	work of journeying inside of themselves and making the attempt to find out just what the hell is
220120	224760	wrong with them, the progressives would rather double down. This gay black furry is esports
224760	229400	player of the year, and he's teaching the far-right a lesson. What's the lesson? That people who rely
229400	234360	on the superficial qualities of themselves are themselves superficial people? Ian Miles-Chung
234360	239400	and fellow right-wing YouTuber Jeremy the Quartering Hambley quickly tried to smear Sonic Fox
239400	244600	by claiming he thinks it's cool to assault women after he enjoyed a video of a pro-life camerawoman
244600	248520	accidentally getting punched by a pro-choice activist. And this is how I know the author of
248520	253720	this article, Anna Valens, probably has the same identity personality problems. You have to be
253720	258920	willfully blind to make that many mistakes. Ian and Jeremy aren't right-wing. They're not claiming
258920	263800	anything about Sonic Fox. Sonic Fox said it himself in his tweet. The woman in the video was clearly
263800	280440	not punched, and even more clearly, it was not an accident. In any case, despite Sonic Fox's
280440	285240	appearance at the Game Awards, as well as the show being generally more inclusive than ever before,
285240	290840	SJWs on Twitter still weren't happy. Jeff tweeted, gaming has been marginalized and dismissed for
290840	296920	far too long. Dirtbag Boyfriend tweeted in reply, marginalized and dismissed. This is what happens
296920	301880	when we educate our oppressors. They use our language as a shield. I don't know what Jeff
301880	307560	is posturing about, but people like him terrify me. White cis men nerds adopting the language
307560	312760	of the oppressed would be ridiculous if it weren't so pervasive. And let me take a guess at what this
312760	318440	Dirtbag Boyfriend's profile looks like. Yeah, exactly the type of garbage account I thought.
318440	322520	Also, I'm blocked by him, and I've never even spoken to him before. I'm not surprised.
322520	327320	I can recall during a previous Christmas season meeting up with a cousin of mine who had just
327320	332680	had kids. I asked her how she was, and I shit you not, she said, oh my kids are fine, and then
332680	337160	launched into a lengthy description of what all of her kids were currently doing. She didn't say
337160	343400	I'm fine, she didn't say I'm fine and my kids are fine, not a single peep about herself. I
343400	347960	understand having kids is a big deal, but if you have no time for yourself, if you allow your
348040	352760	personality to be completely subsumed by your identity, it's not healthy for you,
352760	356120	and it's not healthy for the kids. It's the same with social justice.
356120	360840	If you were to ask somebody you know, tell me three of your personality traits, and their first
360840	365800	three go-tos were black, gay, and furry, you may want to sit down and have a serious discussion
365800	370520	with them about where their life is heading. Not because being black, gay, or a furry is bad,
370520	375160	it's not. But because being the type of person that believes identity markers substitute for
375160	378840	a well-developed personality is not only bad, it's self-destructive.
405160	407960	I would hope that that was true.
