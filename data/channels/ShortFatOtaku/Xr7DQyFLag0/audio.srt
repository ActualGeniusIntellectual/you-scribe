1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Well, well, well, the lazy eye of the God Emperor has finally turned towards Silicon

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,160
Valley's tech giants.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,560
I'm continuing to monitor the censorship of American citizens on social media platforms.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,900
This is the United States of America, and we have what is known as freedom of speech.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,240
We are monitoring and watching closely.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,480
Twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,260
It's called freedom of speech, remember.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,940
You are making a giant mistake.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,700
To be honest, the comments under any Trump tweet are gold.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,340
The man who calls the New York Times and CNN fake news thinks Twitter should be more lenient

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,700
towards conspiracy theories from Russian bots and Alex Jones.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,540
Oh my God, how Russia-phobic of you.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,380
Conservatives are caught out on this site, granted a special protection out of fear of

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,940
cries of bias.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,540
Everyone else can get banned from minor infractions or phony reports, but conservatives get to

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,160
ignore the rules until one goes so far there's a huge backlash.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,280
This is verifiably not true, as evidenced by Jack's appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,200
For example, when Tim Pool brought up that Twitter has codified in its terms of service

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,320
misgendering speech as a violation of the rules, he was making the point that Twitter

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,120
has taken an issue that is not agreed upon by everybody, but instead has a distinct political

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,640
bias and presented it as if it were something neutral like violent content or legitimate

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
threats.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,320
Freedom of speech does not equal freedom of reach.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,960
I know you're upset over the Kremlin nonsense machines being deplatformed, too bad.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,040
No basic rules of civility or be stuck with a toxic waste dump known as GAV, simple.

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,400
Even though most of this comment is trash, there's still a good point here.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,560
Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,080
Twitter also has free speech rights in the United States.

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,960
And a solid argument for Twitter's ability to censor its users is that if Twitter was

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,120
forced to allow speech from users it disagrees with, that would be compelled speech for them.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,760
So yes, freedom of speech does not mean freedom of reach.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,440
The counterargument, of course, is that would we really accept it if, say, a phone company

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,080
cut off service to somebody because of the political opinions they exposed to another

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,440
person using their service?

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,960
I mean, probably not, but more importantly, the ability to even do so would require a

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,520
massive overreach on the part of the phone company, because they would have to monitor

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,640
every single use of their service for content they'd want to ban.

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,880
This is why wiretapping a phone line is considered illegal in most circumstances.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,520
During my dumping with Scrump on the still unfolding Carlos Maza-Steven Crowder situation

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,120
— and I'm sorry I haven't done a full video on it yet, the E3 streams are eating

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,820
up all my time right now — I mentioned that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has what

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,280
is known as a Safe Harbor exception.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Let's go into that a little bit.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,480
In layman's terms, a publisher is a group that has the right to actively accept or reject

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,280
submissions from outside contributors, and has the legal responsibility for everything

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
they publish.

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Contrast this with a platform which has no legal responsibility for what is published

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,320
by its users, but in return it has to make a good faith attempt to censor, delete, and

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,020
report to the authorities content that breaks the law, like child pornography or human trafficking

50
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,180
or legitimate threats or incitement or copyright infringement.

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,900
And their ability to curate content extends only as far as that good faith attempt.

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,880
So a newspaper or a news outlet would be a publisher, able to pick and choose what it

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,320
wants published, but responsible for it all.

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,400
If the company publishes threats, they face the lawsuit.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,880
And a telephone company would be a platform, not responsible for any crimes committed using

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,820
their service, but required to cooperate with authorities if there's reasonable suspicion

57
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,820
against somebody.

58
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,620
It's not that simple, of course, but that's the basic breakdown.

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,660
All of the big tech giants like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are currently considered platforms,

60
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,620
and thus they have the Safe Harbor exception under the DMCA.

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,380
They're not legally liable for the things that their users put out, but they have extensive

62
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,460
systems in place to intercept or delete anything that breaks US law.

63
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,580
Except, as we've seen, they go much farther than that.

64
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,900
They go for hate speech, or dehumanizing speech, or misgendering speech like Twitter, or humiliation

65
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,180
like YouTube, basically much, much farther than a platform's theoretical ability to curate

66
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,180
should allow them.

67
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,740
And you'll notice that when they do it, they try to make it appear as legal as they can.

68
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,160
They'll say that hate speech leads to real-world violence, that misgendering kills trans people,

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,880
that humiliation leads to incitement, et cetera, et cetera.

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,620
The social justice underlings who chant, violence is speech, do so because they want to shut

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,380
up anybody who doesn't agree with them, sure.

72
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,540
But I don't think they're smart enough to understand that big tech only sides with them

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,080
because their line of thought places the social media giants in a privileged position.

74
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,180
That's why, as far as the verified journalists are concerned, Facebook isn't responsible

75
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,420
for the massive amounts of violence livestreamed on its platform, but when a shooter posts

76
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,020
on gab that they're about to blow away a synagogue, it's gab that's at fault, even though on paper

77
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,860
they both have the same legal rights as platforms.

78
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,460
So when Trump says, we're watching, I'm sure the radical lefties who spend all day glued

79
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,640
to their Twitter feeds simply chalk it up as another stupid remark from Cheeto Voldemort.

80
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,180
Then yeah, Trump probably doesn't know what he should do to prevent conservative censorship.

81
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm not even sure if I know what should be done, but I guarantee you, the minute Trump

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,320
sits down with his staff and says, okay, we need to do something about this, what ideas

83
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,760
do you have, somebody in the room will be knowledgeable enough to bring up the DMCA

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,240
and the Safe Harbor exception.

85
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
The social media oligarchs know this, and they are shitting bricks.

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,480
There's two choices for them, become publishers and suddenly face millions of lawsuits every

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,560
time some idiot makes a post that is somehow illegal, or stop censoring people and calling

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,440
it curation or improving conversational health or whatever.

89
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,880
Free speech is not just part of the First Amendment.

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,480
The First Amendment only ensures that the government will not impede free speech.

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,360
But free speech is much larger than that.

92
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,960
It's a natural right, inherent to all people, regardless of any law, any country, any border.

93
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,580
All of you hardcore radical socialists on the left who suddenly turn into ancaps when

94
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,340
commenters begin to question giving big tech unlimited control over the online public square?

95
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,660
Well, the First Amendment is only one pillar of many that the government uses to ensure

96
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
freedom of speech.

97
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,740
If you don't shape up, you're going to get hit with the rest of them.
