0	4680	Well, well, well, the lazy eye of the God Emperor has finally turned towards Silicon
4680	6160	Valley's tech giants.
6160	10560	I'm continuing to monitor the censorship of American citizens on social media platforms.
10560	14900	This is the United States of America, and we have what is known as freedom of speech.
14900	17240	We are monitoring and watching closely.
17240	24480	Twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction.
24480	26260	It's called freedom of speech, remember.
26260	27940	You are making a giant mistake.
27940	30700	To be honest, the comments under any Trump tweet are gold.
30700	35340	The man who calls the New York Times and CNN fake news thinks Twitter should be more lenient
35340	38700	towards conspiracy theories from Russian bots and Alex Jones.
38700	41540	Oh my God, how Russia-phobic of you.
41540	44380	Conservatives are caught out on this site, granted a special protection out of fear of
44380	45940	cries of bias.
45940	50540	Everyone else can get banned from minor infractions or phony reports, but conservatives get to
50540	54160	ignore the rules until one goes so far there's a huge backlash.
54160	58280	This is verifiably not true, as evidenced by Jack's appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.
58280	62200	For example, when Tim Pool brought up that Twitter has codified in its terms of service
62200	66320	misgendering speech as a violation of the rules, he was making the point that Twitter
66320	71120	has taken an issue that is not agreed upon by everybody, but instead has a distinct political
71120	75640	bias and presented it as if it were something neutral like violent content or legitimate
75640	76640	threats.
76640	78320	Freedom of speech does not equal freedom of reach.
78320	82960	I know you're upset over the Kremlin nonsense machines being deplatformed, too bad.
82960	88040	No basic rules of civility or be stuck with a toxic waste dump known as GAV, simple.
88040	91400	Even though most of this comment is trash, there's still a good point here.
91400	93560	Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach.
93560	96080	Twitter also has free speech rights in the United States.
96080	99960	And a solid argument for Twitter's ability to censor its users is that if Twitter was
99960	104120	forced to allow speech from users it disagrees with, that would be compelled speech for them.
104120	106760	So yes, freedom of speech does not mean freedom of reach.
106760	111440	The counterargument, of course, is that would we really accept it if, say, a phone company
111440	115080	cut off service to somebody because of the political opinions they exposed to another
115080	116440	person using their service?
116440	120960	I mean, probably not, but more importantly, the ability to even do so would require a
120960	124520	massive overreach on the part of the phone company, because they would have to monitor
124520	127640	every single use of their service for content they'd want to ban.
127640	131880	This is why wiretapping a phone line is considered illegal in most circumstances.
131880	136520	During my dumping with Scrump on the still unfolding Carlos Maza-Steven Crowder situation
136520	140120	— and I'm sorry I haven't done a full video on it yet, the E3 streams are eating
140120	143820	up all my time right now — I mentioned that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has what
143820	146280	is known as a Safe Harbor exception.
146280	147280	Let's go into that a little bit.
147280	151480	In layman's terms, a publisher is a group that has the right to actively accept or reject
151480	155280	submissions from outside contributors, and has the legal responsibility for everything
155280	156280	they publish.
156280	160280	Contrast this with a platform which has no legal responsibility for what is published
160280	165320	by its users, but in return it has to make a good faith attempt to censor, delete, and
165320	170020	report to the authorities content that breaks the law, like child pornography or human trafficking
170020	173180	or legitimate threats or incitement or copyright infringement.
173180	177900	And their ability to curate content extends only as far as that good faith attempt.
177900	181880	So a newspaper or a news outlet would be a publisher, able to pick and choose what it
181880	184320	wants published, but responsible for it all.
184320	187400	If the company publishes threats, they face the lawsuit.
187400	190880	And a telephone company would be a platform, not responsible for any crimes committed using
190880	194820	their service, but required to cooperate with authorities if there's reasonable suspicion
194820	195820	against somebody.
195820	198620	It's not that simple, of course, but that's the basic breakdown.
198620	203660	All of the big tech giants like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are currently considered platforms,
203660	206620	and thus they have the Safe Harbor exception under the DMCA.
206620	210380	They're not legally liable for the things that their users put out, but they have extensive
210380	214460	systems in place to intercept or delete anything that breaks US law.
214460	217580	Except, as we've seen, they go much farther than that.
217580	223900	They go for hate speech, or dehumanizing speech, or misgendering speech like Twitter, or humiliation
223900	229180	like YouTube, basically much, much farther than a platform's theoretical ability to curate
229180	230180	should allow them.
230180	233740	And you'll notice that when they do it, they try to make it appear as legal as they can.
233740	238160	They'll say that hate speech leads to real-world violence, that misgendering kills trans people,
238160	240880	that humiliation leads to incitement, et cetera, et cetera.
240880	245620	The social justice underlings who chant, violence is speech, do so because they want to shut
245620	247380	up anybody who doesn't agree with them, sure.
247380	251540	But I don't think they're smart enough to understand that big tech only sides with them
251540	256080	because their line of thought places the social media giants in a privileged position.
256080	260180	That's why, as far as the verified journalists are concerned, Facebook isn't responsible
260180	264420	for the massive amounts of violence livestreamed on its platform, but when a shooter posts
264420	269020	on gab that they're about to blow away a synagogue, it's gab that's at fault, even though on paper
269020	271860	they both have the same legal rights as platforms.
271860	276460	So when Trump says, we're watching, I'm sure the radical lefties who spend all day glued
276460	280640	to their Twitter feeds simply chalk it up as another stupid remark from Cheeto Voldemort.
280640	284180	Then yeah, Trump probably doesn't know what he should do to prevent conservative censorship.
284180	287520	I'm not even sure if I know what should be done, but I guarantee you, the minute Trump
287520	292320	sits down with his staff and says, okay, we need to do something about this, what ideas
292320	296760	do you have, somebody in the room will be knowledgeable enough to bring up the DMCA
296760	298240	and the Safe Harbor exception.
298240	302560	The social media oligarchs know this, and they are shitting bricks.
302560	307480	There's two choices for them, become publishers and suddenly face millions of lawsuits every
307480	312560	time some idiot makes a post that is somehow illegal, or stop censoring people and calling
312560	316440	it curation or improving conversational health or whatever.
316440	318880	Free speech is not just part of the First Amendment.
318880	322480	The First Amendment only ensures that the government will not impede free speech.
322480	324360	But free speech is much larger than that.
324360	328960	It's a natural right, inherent to all people, regardless of any law, any country, any border.
328960	333580	All of you hardcore radical socialists on the left who suddenly turn into ancaps when
333580	338340	commenters begin to question giving big tech unlimited control over the online public square?
338340	342660	Well, the First Amendment is only one pillar of many that the government uses to ensure
342660	343660	freedom of speech.
343660	345740	If you don't shape up, you're going to get hit with the rest of them.
