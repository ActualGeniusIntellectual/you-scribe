00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Well, well, well, the lazy eye of the God Emperor has finally turned towards Silicon

00:04.680 --> 00:06.160
Valley's tech giants.

00:06.160 --> 00:10.560
I'm continuing to monitor the censorship of American citizens on social media platforms.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.900
This is the United States of America, and we have what is known as freedom of speech.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.240
We are monitoring and watching closely.

00:17.240 --> 00:24.480
Twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.260
It's called freedom of speech, remember.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.940
You are making a giant mistake.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.700
To be honest, the comments under any Trump tweet are gold.

00:30.700 --> 00:35.340
The man who calls the New York Times and CNN fake news thinks Twitter should be more lenient

00:35.340 --> 00:38.700
towards conspiracy theories from Russian bots and Alex Jones.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.540
Oh my God, how Russia-phobic of you.

00:41.540 --> 00:44.380
Conservatives are caught out on this site, granted a special protection out of fear of

00:44.380 --> 00:45.940
cries of bias.

00:45.940 --> 00:50.540
Everyone else can get banned from minor infractions or phony reports, but conservatives get to

00:50.540 --> 00:54.160
ignore the rules until one goes so far there's a huge backlash.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.280
This is verifiably not true, as evidenced by Jack's appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.200
For example, when Tim Pool brought up that Twitter has codified in its terms of service

01:02.200 --> 01:06.320
misgendering speech as a violation of the rules, he was making the point that Twitter

01:06.320 --> 01:11.120
has taken an issue that is not agreed upon by everybody, but instead has a distinct political

01:11.120 --> 01:15.640
bias and presented it as if it were something neutral like violent content or legitimate

01:15.640 --> 01:16.640
threats.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.320
Freedom of speech does not equal freedom of reach.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.960
I know you're upset over the Kremlin nonsense machines being deplatformed, too bad.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.040
No basic rules of civility or be stuck with a toxic waste dump known as GAV, simple.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.400
Even though most of this comment is trash, there's still a good point here.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.560
Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.080
Twitter also has free speech rights in the United States.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.960
And a solid argument for Twitter's ability to censor its users is that if Twitter was

01:39.960 --> 01:44.120
forced to allow speech from users it disagrees with, that would be compelled speech for them.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.760
So yes, freedom of speech does not mean freedom of reach.

01:46.760 --> 01:51.440
The counterargument, of course, is that would we really accept it if, say, a phone company

01:51.440 --> 01:55.080
cut off service to somebody because of the political opinions they exposed to another

01:55.080 --> 01:56.440
person using their service?

01:56.440 --> 02:00.960
I mean, probably not, but more importantly, the ability to even do so would require a

02:00.960 --> 02:04.520
massive overreach on the part of the phone company, because they would have to monitor

02:04.520 --> 02:07.640
every single use of their service for content they'd want to ban.

02:07.640 --> 02:11.880
This is why wiretapping a phone line is considered illegal in most circumstances.

02:11.880 --> 02:16.520
During my dumping with Scrump on the still unfolding Carlos Maza-Steven Crowder situation

02:16.520 --> 02:20.120
— and I'm sorry I haven't done a full video on it yet, the E3 streams are eating

02:20.120 --> 02:23.820
up all my time right now — I mentioned that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has what

02:23.820 --> 02:26.280
is known as a Safe Harbor exception.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.280
Let's go into that a little bit.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.480
In layman's terms, a publisher is a group that has the right to actively accept or reject

02:31.480 --> 02:35.280
submissions from outside contributors, and has the legal responsibility for everything

02:35.280 --> 02:36.280
they publish.

02:36.280 --> 02:40.280
Contrast this with a platform which has no legal responsibility for what is published

02:40.280 --> 02:45.320
by its users, but in return it has to make a good faith attempt to censor, delete, and

02:45.320 --> 02:50.020
report to the authorities content that breaks the law, like child pornography or human trafficking

02:50.020 --> 02:53.180
or legitimate threats or incitement or copyright infringement.

02:53.180 --> 02:57.900
And their ability to curate content extends only as far as that good faith attempt.

02:57.900 --> 03:01.880
So a newspaper or a news outlet would be a publisher, able to pick and choose what it

03:01.880 --> 03:04.320
wants published, but responsible for it all.

03:04.320 --> 03:07.400
If the company publishes threats, they face the lawsuit.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.880
And a telephone company would be a platform, not responsible for any crimes committed using

03:10.880 --> 03:14.820
their service, but required to cooperate with authorities if there's reasonable suspicion

03:14.820 --> 03:15.820
against somebody.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.620
It's not that simple, of course, but that's the basic breakdown.

03:18.620 --> 03:23.660
All of the big tech giants like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are currently considered platforms,

03:23.660 --> 03:26.620
and thus they have the Safe Harbor exception under the DMCA.

03:26.620 --> 03:30.380
They're not legally liable for the things that their users put out, but they have extensive

03:30.380 --> 03:34.460
systems in place to intercept or delete anything that breaks US law.

03:34.460 --> 03:37.580
Except, as we've seen, they go much farther than that.

03:37.580 --> 03:43.900
They go for hate speech, or dehumanizing speech, or misgendering speech like Twitter, or humiliation

03:43.900 --> 03:49.180
like YouTube, basically much, much farther than a platform's theoretical ability to curate

03:49.180 --> 03:50.180
should allow them.

03:50.180 --> 03:53.740
And you'll notice that when they do it, they try to make it appear as legal as they can.

03:53.740 --> 03:58.160
They'll say that hate speech leads to real-world violence, that misgendering kills trans people,

03:58.160 --> 04:00.880
that humiliation leads to incitement, et cetera, et cetera.

04:00.880 --> 04:05.620
The social justice underlings who chant, violence is speech, do so because they want to shut

04:05.620 --> 04:07.380
up anybody who doesn't agree with them, sure.

04:07.380 --> 04:11.540
But I don't think they're smart enough to understand that big tech only sides with them

04:11.540 --> 04:16.080
because their line of thought places the social media giants in a privileged position.

04:16.080 --> 04:20.180
That's why, as far as the verified journalists are concerned, Facebook isn't responsible

04:20.180 --> 04:24.420
for the massive amounts of violence livestreamed on its platform, but when a shooter posts

04:24.420 --> 04:29.020
on gab that they're about to blow away a synagogue, it's gab that's at fault, even though on paper

04:29.020 --> 04:31.860
they both have the same legal rights as platforms.

04:31.860 --> 04:36.460
So when Trump says, we're watching, I'm sure the radical lefties who spend all day glued

04:36.460 --> 04:40.640
to their Twitter feeds simply chalk it up as another stupid remark from Cheeto Voldemort.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.180
Then yeah, Trump probably doesn't know what he should do to prevent conservative censorship.

04:44.180 --> 04:47.520
I'm not even sure if I know what should be done, but I guarantee you, the minute Trump

04:47.520 --> 04:52.320
sits down with his staff and says, okay, we need to do something about this, what ideas

04:52.320 --> 04:56.760
do you have, somebody in the room will be knowledgeable enough to bring up the DMCA

04:56.760 --> 04:58.240
and the Safe Harbor exception.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.560
The social media oligarchs know this, and they are shitting bricks.

05:02.560 --> 05:07.480
There's two choices for them, become publishers and suddenly face millions of lawsuits every

05:07.480 --> 05:12.560
time some idiot makes a post that is somehow illegal, or stop censoring people and calling

05:12.560 --> 05:16.440
it curation or improving conversational health or whatever.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.880
Free speech is not just part of the First Amendment.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.480
The First Amendment only ensures that the government will not impede free speech.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.360
But free speech is much larger than that.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.960
It's a natural right, inherent to all people, regardless of any law, any country, any border.

05:28.960 --> 05:33.580
All of you hardcore radical socialists on the left who suddenly turn into ancaps when

05:33.580 --> 05:38.340
commenters begin to question giving big tech unlimited control over the online public square?

05:38.340 --> 05:42.660
Well, the First Amendment is only one pillar of many that the government uses to ensure

05:42.660 --> 05:43.660
freedom of speech.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.740
If you don't shape up, you're going to get hit with the rest of them.
