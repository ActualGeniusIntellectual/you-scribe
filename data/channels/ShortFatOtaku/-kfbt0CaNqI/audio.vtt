00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Before I get started guys, I want to point out that yes I have been demonetized, no I

00:05.720 --> 00:10.160
have not been told why, I don't know what video did it, I don't know what part of what

00:10.160 --> 00:15.540
video did it, they simply said hate speech and I don't know anything, I've been told

00:15.540 --> 00:21.440
nothing by YouTube and frankly I might be financially fucked if this sticks.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.640
So please consider checking the description of this video because I've put links to support

00:25.640 --> 00:29.680
the channel down there, they're also on screen too so if you want to financially support

00:29.680 --> 00:32.740
what I'm doing, thank you very much.

00:32.740 --> 00:36.880
Again even in a time like this please don't feel obligated, I know people are out of jobs,

00:36.880 --> 00:42.040
I know people are getting sick, I know things are generally on a downturn for everyone,

00:42.040 --> 00:45.520
before you give me anything make sure you take care of yourself okay?

00:45.520 --> 00:50.220
By the way yesterday's video got a lot of people angry and I mean fair enough, but like

00:50.220 --> 00:55.200
I've said I've always been neutral on Trump, I will give him the benefit of the doubt but

00:55.200 --> 00:58.900
I will give anybody the benefit of the doubt, nobody's perfect.

00:58.900 --> 01:04.460
If you're subbed to this channel for unapologetic god emperor simping, you're in the wrong place

01:04.460 --> 01:05.660
unfortunately.

01:05.660 --> 01:11.000
That being said the main reason that I released it the time that I did is because basically

01:11.000 --> 01:18.140
I had recorded it before my demonetization and frankly guys that kind of hit me pretty

01:18.140 --> 01:21.380
hard I mean like motivationally you know?

01:21.380 --> 01:27.160
I definitely just took some time off and you know it is actually a little bit harder to

01:27.160 --> 01:31.220
get the gumption to do this sort of thing when you know that YouTube's still running

01:31.220 --> 01:36.320
ads on your videos and just taking 100% of the revenue, but I took a couple days off

01:36.320 --> 01:40.520
and I said you know I've got to do something I guess, I mean I have some kind of appeals

01:40.520 --> 01:44.160
process working so hopefully it'll work out but in the meantime I've got to do something

01:44.160 --> 01:45.160
right?

01:45.160 --> 01:48.680
So I took this video that I had recorded you know a day or two earlier and I finally finished

01:48.680 --> 01:50.140
the editing and put it out.

01:50.140 --> 01:55.760
Of course bad timing because at the same time Donald Trump tested positive as well as his

01:55.760 --> 01:57.640
wife for coronavirus.

01:57.640 --> 02:01.560
We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately we will get through this

02:01.560 --> 02:04.280
together holy shit dude.

02:04.280 --> 02:09.040
Stock futures sharply fall after President Donald Trump tweets that he has tested positive

02:09.040 --> 02:10.040
for coronavirus.

02:10.040 --> 02:14.440
Now this happened shortly after the debates and everyone was thinking oh no does Joe Biden

02:14.440 --> 02:15.440
have coronavirus?

02:15.440 --> 02:19.760
But it turns out that Joe Biden says or rather the person who runs his Twitter account because

02:19.760 --> 02:24.280
we all know he doesn't actually use his own Twitter they say I'm happy to report that

02:24.280 --> 02:27.080
Jill and I have tested negative for COVID.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.920
Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern I hope this serves as a reminder wear

02:30.920 --> 02:36.120
a mask keep social distance and wash your hands unless you're going to a protest.

02:36.120 --> 02:41.480
Of course not everyone is civil here's Ilhan Omar as someone who lost my own father to

02:41.480 --> 02:44.960
this virus and seeing the pain it causes I don't wish on anyone.

02:44.960 --> 02:49.480
Over 200,000 people have now died while this administration actively ignores public health

02:49.480 --> 02:52.280
guidance and suppresses science.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.320
For months we have been hoping for a simple acknowledgement from the president to hear

02:55.320 --> 02:59.520
the words we will get through this together and now we only hear those words when it is

02:59.520 --> 03:03.500
about him not the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their lives and the millions

03:03.500 --> 03:07.320
whose families have been touched by it because of his malfeasance.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.960
You know considering that you are a representative in the House you should understand that the

03:11.960 --> 03:16.800
presidency the office of the presidency does not have the power to do the things you're

03:16.800 --> 03:18.320
asking of it.

03:18.320 --> 03:22.880
It's in the 10th amendment the states have to handle this the state governors the state

03:22.880 --> 03:27.020
governments the president of the United States and Republicans in Minnesota are actively

03:27.020 --> 03:31.240
spreading a deadly virus they are a risk to the public health of my constituents and our

03:31.240 --> 03:36.300
country Republicans are the ones that are spreading the virus around not the protesters

03:36.300 --> 03:39.400
and yes we're going to be going back to that protester well quite a bit because there's

03:39.400 --> 03:44.240
going to be some serious problems here Republicans asking for decorum and empathy like they didn't

03:44.240 --> 03:49.600
wish violence on protesters lmao also he's a white supremacist running a fascist government

03:49.600 --> 03:54.960
and 209,000 people have died due to his mismanagement and peddling that it's a hoax I have zero

03:54.960 --> 03:59.760
sympathy for these assholes it's pretty amazing you can you can tell who the people are that

03:59.760 --> 04:05.120
don't actually get their news from multiple sources they get it from one ideological source

04:05.120 --> 04:09.040
or they just filter what they get through that ideological framework because you get

04:09.040 --> 04:14.400
nonsense like this I know I'm not a Republican but I don't wish violence on protesters I

04:14.400 --> 04:19.040
don't even wish violence on rioters I would rather the riot not happen I would rather

04:19.040 --> 04:25.160
the riot stop before violence self-defensive violence becomes necessary but having the

04:25.160 --> 04:30.420
fortitude to use violence to defend yourself does not mean that you wish for violence and

04:30.420 --> 04:35.040
frankly these idiots don't know what fascism is like I recall the right calling Obama a

04:35.040 --> 04:39.480
fascist back when the Democrats kept winning this happens all the fucking time it happens

04:39.480 --> 04:43.200
every single every single election cycle every single time there's been like a presidential

04:43.200 --> 04:47.120
shift the op the opposition is like all those guys are fashy taking away our rights and

04:47.120 --> 04:52.520
it's like no no I mean Obama did some some terrible stuff obviously but no no one's a

04:52.520 --> 04:59.800
fascist dude so just a quick question on a scale of one to ten is this your favorite

04:59.800 --> 05:08.240
or most favorite October surprise in the history of electoral politics for me personally

05:08.240 --> 05:13.960
I think it ranks pretty high up there but you know love to hear your thoughts but of

05:13.960 --> 05:18.480
course we know it's not about civility to these people they think civility is white

05:18.480 --> 05:23.320
supremacy or something it's entirely about power that is the point of the Marxist lens

05:23.320 --> 05:27.760
is to frame everything in terms of power politics well more specifically class conflict but

05:27.760 --> 05:32.440
that just boils down to power politics in reality for example a certain mold of liberal

05:32.440 --> 05:37.440
sees the right as a jousting partner to have eternal sparring matches with in the effervescent

05:37.440 --> 05:42.740
marketplace of ideas rather than a class enemy to be defeated by any means necessary and

05:42.740 --> 05:47.220
most efficiently this explains a lot of their behavior this is because liberals understand

05:47.220 --> 05:51.160
that their political opponents are generally not evil like sometimes you get the occasional

05:51.160 --> 05:56.480
evil person but most of the time the real functional answer to any given problem is

05:56.480 --> 06:01.640
somewhere between the liberal and conservative positions additionally most socialists and

06:01.640 --> 06:07.500
most fascists probably aren't bad people either they're just horribly misguided but when everything

06:07.500 --> 06:14.660
is class conflict when it all boils down to power politics when all war is a war over

06:14.660 --> 06:19.420
material conditions this is the kind of brain-dead attitude that you get the reason that you

06:19.420 --> 06:25.580
have eternal sparring matches within the marketplace of ideas is because none of us none of us

06:25.580 --> 06:31.500
including the socialists know what the right answer is have no idea what the right answer

06:31.500 --> 06:37.080
is some people think that they do some people think that they can take any topic but pick

06:37.080 --> 06:42.160
up a pick a topic doesn't matter filter it through the Marxist lens and out comes a pre-packaged

06:42.160 --> 06:46.840
proper answer for it but of course in reality that almost never actually works you find

06:46.840 --> 06:52.420
the truth not by following a dogma but by taking every single fact you can and clashing

06:52.420 --> 06:56.940
them against each other until what remains is a pure product the truth that is what the

06:56.940 --> 07:01.940
marketplace of ideas is and that is why you need those eternal sparring matches to simply

07:01.940 --> 07:07.580
view those who oppose you as your eternal enemy even in those cases where they're factually

07:07.580 --> 07:12.140
correct means that you're not interested in truth you're interested in power and of course

07:12.140 --> 07:15.960
this squirrel person here is kind of a known socialist on Twitter and they post their own

07:15.960 --> 07:20.960
take along with some other takes from neo libs who are wishing Trump a speedy recovery

07:20.960 --> 07:27.600
and the message is clear civility compromise coming to at the very least a reasonable understanding

07:27.600 --> 07:32.960
if you don't always agree making up becoming friends again these things are the antithesis

07:32.960 --> 07:37.840
of the idea that everything is power politics Trump went to Bedminster and exposed staff

07:37.840 --> 07:41.280
and fundraiser attendees when he already knew he had COVID when he was already symptomatic

07:41.280 --> 07:46.640
and receiving treatment dude this this isn't true man like we're gonna go over some articles

07:46.640 --> 07:51.500
and some sources a little bit later but yeah this isn't true you don't need to all caps

07:51.500 --> 07:56.700
a bunch of false shit and then make that go viral because people are just literally looking

07:56.700 --> 08:01.480
for anything that they can grab onto at this point and seriously this is on both sides

08:01.480 --> 08:06.600
like here's what Greg Gutfield said on Fox News to the point about the script being flipped

08:06.600 --> 08:09.760
the reason why it flipped and maybe it's a flaw of Trump is that he didn't hide from

08:09.760 --> 08:13.780
the virus the reason he didn't hide from the virus is that he didn't want America to hide

08:13.780 --> 08:18.700
from the virus if he was going to ask America to get back to work and experience a risk he was

08:18.700 --> 08:22.180
going to do the same thing so I think he put himself on the line and that the flaw being that

08:22.180 --> 08:25.860
as an optimist as somebody who was trying to convey a message that we are going to get through

08:25.860 --> 08:30.160
this and things are gonna be better he had to walk that walk and he had to do that you could

08:30.160 --> 08:33.660
have scared the crap out of everybody but he refused and it goes back to his original point

08:33.660 --> 08:36.860
about trying to make sure that the positive attitude is maintained along with a sense of

08:36.860 --> 08:41.900
concern so he took the risk he got the virus but he was doing it for us this is some mega

08:41.980 --> 08:47.500
cope dude come on like I definitely don't believe with the leftist point of view of shut down

08:47.500 --> 08:51.860
everything forever this is the new normal if you don't wear the mask at all times even when you're

08:51.860 --> 08:56.340
sleeping or having sex then you want grandma to die but at the same time I think this Trump got

08:56.340 --> 09:02.100
sick for us kind of idea is is a bit stupid sometimes you get sick it's just how it is

09:02.100 --> 09:05.300
sometimes you take precautions and get sick anyway and sometimes you don't take precautions

09:05.300 --> 09:10.740
and you're fine the virus is not a entirely controllable variable here and it is a product

09:10.740 --> 09:15.780
of our own arrogance to think that we can manage this any more than we have frankly and of course

09:15.780 --> 09:21.220
we do have the mirror universe gaslighting from you know the usual sources this one's from the

09:21.220 --> 09:25.820
Washington Post but they're all very similar after Trump's positive test conservative media

09:25.820 --> 09:31.340
goes after liberal critics real and imagined you know if that happened I haven't really seen it

09:31.340 --> 09:36.700
what I have seen is a lot of people who are saying lol I can't wait for Trump to die they're writing

09:36.700 --> 09:41.620
their weird Trump fan fictions about how hopefully he's rotting away at the hospital and he's like on

09:41.620 --> 09:45.540
life support for like the next 50 years or something and how RBG comes back from the dead

09:45.540 --> 09:49.820
to go to the Supreme Court and then give the election to Biden or some nonsense like this it

09:49.820 --> 09:55.060
is kind of crazy the the level of conspiracy theory I've seen online I wonder if we'll approach

09:55.060 --> 10:00.300
QAnon levels maybe if Trump's in the hospital for a while like check this fucking clown I don't want

10:00.300 --> 10:06.300
to be alarmist but a GOP source just told me this Trump's condition is serious he can go either way

10:06.460 --> 10:10.820
despite all the meds and the presidential care they could lose him within three to four days

10:10.820 --> 10:16.300
they're trying to make his condition look good to reassure his base I have no way to confirm this

10:16.300 --> 10:21.020
report but I felt like I should pass it along of course you did you dude you're literally on team

10:21.020 --> 10:26.500
Joe like look at this yeah hashtag team Joe formerly chair of the Democrat coalition national

10:26.500 --> 10:33.140
finance chair for draft Biden 2016 Long Island campaign chair for Barack Obama do you think you

10:33.180 --> 10:40.100
are a reasonable unbiased source of information this is literal do to trust me bro levels of

10:40.100 --> 10:45.340
sourcing pretty sure Trump boarded marine one with a portable oxygen concentrator in his pocket

10:45.340 --> 10:50.860
with the nasal cannula was it can I don't know that is cannula going up his back hidden in his

10:50.860 --> 10:57.260
hair and tucked under his mask he is not as well as they say liar-in-chief look at this dude look

10:57.260 --> 11:03.220
at this fucking tweet like that this is just Trump being fat all right this is just Trump

11:03.220 --> 11:10.020
being fat this is literally just a piece of hair you guys need to calm the fuck down man this is

11:10.020 --> 11:14.300
not like a nothing tweet like this took off but yeah apparently he was feeling bad enough that

11:14.300 --> 11:19.500
he had to go to the hospital so he hopped on marine one and went out there and the media

11:19.500 --> 11:23.900
wasn't happy about it here's CNN's chief White House correspondent Trump did not stop for questions

11:24.420 --> 11:30.860
dude he's got fucking coronavirus he's going to the hospital fuck you this is from the physician

11:30.860 --> 11:35.540
to the president this afternoon in consultation with specialists from Walter Reed and John

11:35.540 --> 11:39.980
Hopkins University I recommended movement of the president up to Walter Reed National Military

11:39.980 --> 11:44.140
Medical Center for further monitoring this evening I'm happy to report the president is doing very

11:44.140 --> 11:48.380
well he is not requiring any supplemental oxygen but in consultation with specialists we have

11:48.380 --> 11:53.460
elected to initiate remdesivir therapy which I assume is some kind of therapy they've developed

11:53.460 --> 11:58.780
for coronavirus he has completed his first dose and is resting at comfortably yeah back in June

11:58.780 --> 12:04.140
remdesivir was being reported on as potentially a treatment for coronavirus it's normally an

12:04.140 --> 12:09.620
Ebola medication so all right okay of course at the same time we were also getting this video so

12:09.620 --> 12:15.020
geez who knows dude uh Jim you were there when the president walked out of the White House and

12:15.020 --> 12:20.740
Border Marine one yeah I know you have some new reporting on his condition yeah Anderson I talked

12:20.740 --> 12:26.580
to a Trump campaign advisor just a short while ago who said that this is serious that the

12:26.580 --> 12:33.980
president has been having some trouble breathing that he's been very fatigued today very tired and

12:33.980 --> 12:39.380
you know emphasized that you know this is not just a run-of-the-mill trip up to Walter Reed

12:39.380 --> 12:44.140
that this is a serious situation talked to another source familiar with this situation this evening

12:44.140 --> 12:49.420
who said that there are serious concerns among White House staffers about the president's

12:49.420 --> 12:56.580
condition as a recording this is the most recent update on Trump's status which I mean there's so

12:56.580 --> 13:01.020
much floating around right now from both sides people wanting him dead people like thinking

13:01.020 --> 13:04.980
there's a conspiracy people saying that he's doomed people saying that he deserves it people

13:04.980 --> 13:08.700
saying that he's he's on his deathbed and the government's hiding it people saying that he's

13:08.700 --> 13:13.740
actually just fine like everything is being said right now but this clip is the most recent

13:13.740 --> 13:19.940
concrete word that we have I recommended we bring the president up to Walter Reed as a

13:19.940 --> 13:28.780
precautionary measure to provide state-of-the-art monitoring and any care that he may need just 72

13:28.780 --> 13:33.580
hours into the diagnosis now the first week of kovat in a particular day 7 to 10 of the most

13:33.580 --> 13:40.260
critical and determining the likely course of this illness at this time the team and I are extremely

13:40.300 --> 13:45.180
happy with the progress the president has made Thursday he had a mild cough and some nasal

13:45.180 --> 13:51.060
congestion and fatigue all of which are now resolving and improving nevermind while I was

13:51.060 --> 13:58.300
editing this video this came out this is in fact the newest bit of information that we have from

13:58.300 --> 14:04.340
Trump himself take a look I want to begin by thanking all of the incredible medical professionals

14:04.500 --> 14:10.540
the doctors the nurses everybody at Walter Reed Medical Center I think it's the finest in the

14:10.540 --> 14:18.540
world for the incredible job they've been doing I came here wasn't feeling so well I feel much

14:18.540 --> 14:24.620
better now we're working hard to get me all the way back I have to be back because we still have

14:24.620 --> 14:31.340
to make America great again we've done an awfully good job of that but we still have steps to go and

14:31.340 --> 14:38.220
we have to finish that job and I'll be back I think I'll be back soon and I look forward to

14:38.220 --> 14:43.420
finishing up the campaign the way it was started and the way we've been doing the kind of numbers

14:43.420 --> 14:48.060
that we've been doing we've been so proud of it but this was something that happened and it's

14:48.060 --> 14:53.780
happened to millions of people all over the world and I'm fighting for them not just in the US I'm

14:53.780 --> 14:58.460
fighting for them all over the world we're gonna beat this coronavirus or whatever you want to call

14:58.460 --> 15:04.900
it and we're gonna beat it soundly so many things have happened if you look at the therapeutics

15:04.900 --> 15:12.380
which I'm taking right now some of them and others are coming out soon that are looking like frankly

15:12.380 --> 15:16.620
they're miracles if you want to know the truth they're miracles people criticize me when I say

15:16.620 --> 15:22.220
that but we have things happening that look like they're miracles coming down from God man he's

15:22.220 --> 15:26.260
quite fatigued isn't he like I know that he's trying to hide it but his voice is a little bit

15:26.300 --> 15:33.380
gravelier than usual he's slouched over in front of a table he's not standing up he's got like he's

15:33.380 --> 15:37.780
not wearing a tie probably because of the fever I think he's trying to put on a brave face but I

15:37.780 --> 15:43.540
actually do think he's quite sick damn so there we go I mean it's not unlike the situation when

15:43.540 --> 15:49.660
Boris Johnson got coronavirus in the UK people treated him like shit too there was there was

15:49.660 --> 15:54.820
tons of stuff going around on Twitter about it from the so-called more compassionate side of

15:54.820 --> 15:59.060
politics that apparently cares a lot about everyone's health and well-being when it comes

15:59.060 --> 16:04.860
to their political opponents they just don't give a shit I recall seeing nobody except the most vile

16:04.860 --> 16:13.660
people on the right dancing on RBG's grave and yet it seems to be every single leftist like every

16:13.660 --> 16:19.300
single leftist with a few only a few exceptions that are like I hope Trump dies dude hashtag

16:19.300 --> 16:23.460
kovat caught Trump it's honestly disgusting it reminds me of the way that the old right

16:23.460 --> 16:28.220
behaved during the Obama era when they wanted Obama dead however what people are focusing on

16:28.220 --> 16:34.140
are Trump's behaviors leading up to his getting tested Trump kept his regular schedule after

16:34.140 --> 16:39.420
learning his close aid Hope Hicks had kovat US President Donald Trump learned on Thursday

16:39.420 --> 16:44.180
morning that his aid Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus yet continued on with a full

16:44.180 --> 16:49.420
schedule of events including a fundraiser at his New Jersey resort that raised five million dollars

16:49.460 --> 16:53.860
Trump's movements are being closely scrutinized since he later tested positive for coronavirus

16:53.860 --> 16:59.700
announcing the news shortly before 1 a.m. Friday Washington time the White House has not said when

16:59.700 --> 17:04.540
Trump first tested positive for the virus but Trump said on late Thursday he was awaiting the

17:04.540 --> 17:09.460
results in between learning the news of Hicks's infection Thursday morning and announcing his

17:09.460 --> 17:14.420
own early Friday Trump stuck to his prepared schedule it is not known whether Trump was

17:14.420 --> 17:20.220
tested Thursday morning after receiving the news of Hicks's positive test as soon as he found out

17:20.220 --> 17:25.820
he was tested and as soon as he tested positive he went into quarantine said Larry Kudlow his

17:25.820 --> 17:30.340
director of the National Economic Council I can't give you the chronology because I wasn't there on

17:30.340 --> 17:35.140
Thursday Trump had no publicly scheduled events that morning after a late-night return from a

17:35.140 --> 17:39.300
rally in Minnesota a trip that Hicks also attended she was separated from the rest of the White House

17:39.300 --> 17:44.340
staff on Air Force One on the trip home Wednesday night after falling ill the press secretary

17:44.340 --> 17:48.580
Kayleigh McKinney held a briefing shortly before noon on Thursday taking the podium without a mask

17:48.580 --> 17:53.740
at that time she did not know Hicks had tested positive Trump left the White House at 1 p.m.

17:53.740 --> 17:58.980
Thursday not stopping to speak to reporters before boarding his helicopter he flew on Air Force One

17:58.980 --> 18:03.740
to New Jersey and then by helicopter into his Bedminster golf club before a fundraiser and this

18:03.780 --> 18:10.380
seems to be the point of contention did Trump know that his aide Hope Hicks had been diagnosed by 1

18:10.380 --> 18:15.020
p.m. on Thursday that's still something we don't really know the answer to just yet but what we do

18:15.020 --> 18:20.180
know is that people online are losing their minds they're saying that Hope Hicks was a plant to try

18:20.180 --> 18:24.580
to get the the president killed they're saying that Trump knew like two or three days ago he

18:24.580 --> 18:28.500
just didn't care and he was going around speaking to everybody some people are saying Trump knew

18:28.500 --> 18:34.580
before the debate like before you and Hope Hicks got it like crazy stuff right and none of this

18:34.580 --> 18:40.100
has any proof from from either side it's all just literally people losing their minds and now they're

18:40.100 --> 18:45.020
calling all of Trump's events like super spreader events and and stuff like this and it's like come

18:45.020 --> 18:50.020
on you guys have been promoting these fucking riots where there's thousands of people out in

18:50.020 --> 18:54.700
the streets throwing molotovs burning buildings down attacking people shooting people but anyway

18:54.700 --> 18:59.820
like I always say we have to behave better than our opponents there is no reason to celebrate when

18:59.820 --> 19:05.540
anyone gets coronavirus I would not be happy if Joe Biden caught it I would not be happy if Bernie

19:05.540 --> 19:10.300
Sanders caught it and I'm not happy that Trump caught it I don't want my political opponents to

19:10.300 --> 19:14.620
simply die but right now that is the attitude of a lot of people on the left and like I said

19:14.620 --> 19:19.140
there's no surprise that attitude has manifested in street violence that has taken lives because

19:19.140 --> 19:23.860
the honest truth is if you are at the point where you simply want your political opponents to die

19:23.860 --> 19:30.540
there is no compromise with them there is no back and forth as lay socialist squirrels said there's

19:30.540 --> 19:36.460
no marketplace of ideas it's all it all just boils down to class conflict eternal power struggle no

19:36.460 --> 19:42.820
reasoning no coming together just fight until one side is completely extinguished if that is where

19:42.820 --> 19:47.820
the left is right now then the only reason they haven't started a civil war yet is because they

19:47.820 --> 19:52.100
are complete cowards and they know they would lose it is one thing to have a political opponent you

19:52.100 --> 19:56.540
can debate with that you can compromise with that has a legitimate point of view that you can at

19:56.540 --> 20:02.260
least understand if not agree with it's another thing entirely to have a political opponent that

20:02.260 --> 20:07.940
simply wants you dead whether that's for racial reasons or class reasons or political reasons

20:07.940 --> 20:13.620
doesn't matter if their baseline of politics truly is convert or die and they're too inept to

20:13.620 --> 20:18.260
actually convert people and too cowardly to actually enforce the die part then they're

20:18.260 --> 20:23.700
honestly just a bunch of fucking losers aren't they anyway let's hope Trump gets well let's

20:23.700 --> 20:28.900
hope any leftist who catches the virus also gets well and let's please bring politics back to a

20:28.900 --> 20:34.180
sensible location where we're not cheering for random chance to potentially kill those

20:34.180 --> 20:37.460
that we disagree with please can we get back to that
