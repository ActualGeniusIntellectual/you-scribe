0	5720	Before I get started guys, I want to point out that yes I have been demonetized, no I
5720	10160	have not been told why, I don't know what video did it, I don't know what part of what
10160	15540	video did it, they simply said hate speech and I don't know anything, I've been told
15540	21440	nothing by YouTube and frankly I might be financially fucked if this sticks.
21440	25640	So please consider checking the description of this video because I've put links to support
25640	29680	the channel down there, they're also on screen too so if you want to financially support
29680	32740	what I'm doing, thank you very much.
32740	36880	Again even in a time like this please don't feel obligated, I know people are out of jobs,
36880	42040	I know people are getting sick, I know things are generally on a downturn for everyone,
42040	45520	before you give me anything make sure you take care of yourself okay?
45520	50220	By the way yesterday's video got a lot of people angry and I mean fair enough, but like
50220	55200	I've said I've always been neutral on Trump, I will give him the benefit of the doubt but
55200	58900	I will give anybody the benefit of the doubt, nobody's perfect.
58900	64460	If you're subbed to this channel for unapologetic god emperor simping, you're in the wrong place
64460	65660	unfortunately.
65660	71000	That being said the main reason that I released it the time that I did is because basically
71000	78140	I had recorded it before my demonetization and frankly guys that kind of hit me pretty
78140	81380	hard I mean like motivationally you know?
81380	87160	I definitely just took some time off and you know it is actually a little bit harder to
87160	91220	get the gumption to do this sort of thing when you know that YouTube's still running
91220	96320	ads on your videos and just taking 100% of the revenue, but I took a couple days off
96320	100520	and I said you know I've got to do something I guess, I mean I have some kind of appeals
100520	104160	process working so hopefully it'll work out but in the meantime I've got to do something
104160	105160	right?
105160	108680	So I took this video that I had recorded you know a day or two earlier and I finally finished
108680	110140	the editing and put it out.
110140	115760	Of course bad timing because at the same time Donald Trump tested positive as well as his
115760	117640	wife for coronavirus.
117640	121560	We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately we will get through this
121560	124280	together holy shit dude.
124280	129040	Stock futures sharply fall after President Donald Trump tweets that he has tested positive
129040	130040	for coronavirus.
130040	134440	Now this happened shortly after the debates and everyone was thinking oh no does Joe Biden
134440	135440	have coronavirus?
135440	139760	But it turns out that Joe Biden says or rather the person who runs his Twitter account because
139760	144280	we all know he doesn't actually use his own Twitter they say I'm happy to report that
144280	147080	Jill and I have tested negative for COVID.
147080	150920	Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern I hope this serves as a reminder wear
150920	156120	a mask keep social distance and wash your hands unless you're going to a protest.
156120	161480	Of course not everyone is civil here's Ilhan Omar as someone who lost my own father to
161480	164960	this virus and seeing the pain it causes I don't wish on anyone.
164960	169480	Over 200,000 people have now died while this administration actively ignores public health
169480	172280	guidance and suppresses science.
172280	175320	For months we have been hoping for a simple acknowledgement from the president to hear
175320	179520	the words we will get through this together and now we only hear those words when it is
179520	183500	about him not the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their lives and the millions
183500	187320	whose families have been touched by it because of his malfeasance.
187320	191960	You know considering that you are a representative in the House you should understand that the
191960	196800	presidency the office of the presidency does not have the power to do the things you're
196800	198320	asking of it.
198320	202880	It's in the 10th amendment the states have to handle this the state governors the state
202880	207020	governments the president of the United States and Republicans in Minnesota are actively
207020	211240	spreading a deadly virus they are a risk to the public health of my constituents and our
211240	216300	country Republicans are the ones that are spreading the virus around not the protesters
216300	219400	and yes we're going to be going back to that protester well quite a bit because there's
219400	224240	going to be some serious problems here Republicans asking for decorum and empathy like they didn't
224240	229600	wish violence on protesters lmao also he's a white supremacist running a fascist government
229600	234960	and 209,000 people have died due to his mismanagement and peddling that it's a hoax I have zero
234960	239760	sympathy for these assholes it's pretty amazing you can you can tell who the people are that
239760	245120	don't actually get their news from multiple sources they get it from one ideological source
245120	249040	or they just filter what they get through that ideological framework because you get
249040	254400	nonsense like this I know I'm not a Republican but I don't wish violence on protesters I
254400	259040	don't even wish violence on rioters I would rather the riot not happen I would rather
259040	265160	the riot stop before violence self-defensive violence becomes necessary but having the
265160	270420	fortitude to use violence to defend yourself does not mean that you wish for violence and
270420	275040	frankly these idiots don't know what fascism is like I recall the right calling Obama a
275040	279480	fascist back when the Democrats kept winning this happens all the fucking time it happens
279480	283200	every single every single election cycle every single time there's been like a presidential
283200	287120	shift the op the opposition is like all those guys are fashy taking away our rights and
287120	292520	it's like no no I mean Obama did some some terrible stuff obviously but no no one's a
292520	299800	fascist dude so just a quick question on a scale of one to ten is this your favorite
299800	308240	or most favorite October surprise in the history of electoral politics for me personally
308240	313960	I think it ranks pretty high up there but you know love to hear your thoughts but of
313960	318480	course we know it's not about civility to these people they think civility is white
318480	323320	supremacy or something it's entirely about power that is the point of the Marxist lens
323320	327760	is to frame everything in terms of power politics well more specifically class conflict but
327760	332440	that just boils down to power politics in reality for example a certain mold of liberal
332440	337440	sees the right as a jousting partner to have eternal sparring matches with in the effervescent
337440	342740	marketplace of ideas rather than a class enemy to be defeated by any means necessary and
342740	347220	most efficiently this explains a lot of their behavior this is because liberals understand
347220	351160	that their political opponents are generally not evil like sometimes you get the occasional
351160	356480	evil person but most of the time the real functional answer to any given problem is
356480	361640	somewhere between the liberal and conservative positions additionally most socialists and
361640	367500	most fascists probably aren't bad people either they're just horribly misguided but when everything
367500	374660	is class conflict when it all boils down to power politics when all war is a war over
374660	379420	material conditions this is the kind of brain-dead attitude that you get the reason that you
379420	385580	have eternal sparring matches within the marketplace of ideas is because none of us none of us
385580	391500	including the socialists know what the right answer is have no idea what the right answer
391500	397080	is some people think that they do some people think that they can take any topic but pick
397080	402160	up a pick a topic doesn't matter filter it through the Marxist lens and out comes a pre-packaged
402160	406840	proper answer for it but of course in reality that almost never actually works you find
406840	412420	the truth not by following a dogma but by taking every single fact you can and clashing
412420	416940	them against each other until what remains is a pure product the truth that is what the
416940	421940	marketplace of ideas is and that is why you need those eternal sparring matches to simply
421940	427580	view those who oppose you as your eternal enemy even in those cases where they're factually
427580	432140	correct means that you're not interested in truth you're interested in power and of course
432140	435960	this squirrel person here is kind of a known socialist on Twitter and they post their own
435960	440960	take along with some other takes from neo libs who are wishing Trump a speedy recovery
440960	447600	and the message is clear civility compromise coming to at the very least a reasonable understanding
447600	452960	if you don't always agree making up becoming friends again these things are the antithesis
452960	457840	of the idea that everything is power politics Trump went to Bedminster and exposed staff
457840	461280	and fundraiser attendees when he already knew he had COVID when he was already symptomatic
461280	466640	and receiving treatment dude this this isn't true man like we're gonna go over some articles
466640	471500	and some sources a little bit later but yeah this isn't true you don't need to all caps
471500	476700	a bunch of false shit and then make that go viral because people are just literally looking
476700	481480	for anything that they can grab onto at this point and seriously this is on both sides
481480	486600	like here's what Greg Gutfield said on Fox News to the point about the script being flipped
486600	489760	the reason why it flipped and maybe it's a flaw of Trump is that he didn't hide from
489760	493780	the virus the reason he didn't hide from the virus is that he didn't want America to hide
493780	498700	from the virus if he was going to ask America to get back to work and experience a risk he was
498700	502180	going to do the same thing so I think he put himself on the line and that the flaw being that
502180	505860	as an optimist as somebody who was trying to convey a message that we are going to get through
505860	510160	this and things are gonna be better he had to walk that walk and he had to do that you could
510160	513660	have scared the crap out of everybody but he refused and it goes back to his original point
513660	516860	about trying to make sure that the positive attitude is maintained along with a sense of
516860	521900	concern so he took the risk he got the virus but he was doing it for us this is some mega
521980	527500	cope dude come on like I definitely don't believe with the leftist point of view of shut down
527500	531860	everything forever this is the new normal if you don't wear the mask at all times even when you're
531860	536340	sleeping or having sex then you want grandma to die but at the same time I think this Trump got
536340	542100	sick for us kind of idea is is a bit stupid sometimes you get sick it's just how it is
542100	545300	sometimes you take precautions and get sick anyway and sometimes you don't take precautions
545300	550740	and you're fine the virus is not a entirely controllable variable here and it is a product
550740	555780	of our own arrogance to think that we can manage this any more than we have frankly and of course
555780	561220	we do have the mirror universe gaslighting from you know the usual sources this one's from the
561220	565820	Washington Post but they're all very similar after Trump's positive test conservative media
565820	571340	goes after liberal critics real and imagined you know if that happened I haven't really seen it
571340	576700	what I have seen is a lot of people who are saying lol I can't wait for Trump to die they're writing
576700	581620	their weird Trump fan fictions about how hopefully he's rotting away at the hospital and he's like on
581620	585540	life support for like the next 50 years or something and how RBG comes back from the dead
585540	589820	to go to the Supreme Court and then give the election to Biden or some nonsense like this it
589820	595060	is kind of crazy the the level of conspiracy theory I've seen online I wonder if we'll approach
595060	600300	QAnon levels maybe if Trump's in the hospital for a while like check this fucking clown I don't want
600300	606300	to be alarmist but a GOP source just told me this Trump's condition is serious he can go either way
606460	610820	despite all the meds and the presidential care they could lose him within three to four days
610820	616300	they're trying to make his condition look good to reassure his base I have no way to confirm this
616300	621020	report but I felt like I should pass it along of course you did you dude you're literally on team
621020	626500	Joe like look at this yeah hashtag team Joe formerly chair of the Democrat coalition national
626500	633140	finance chair for draft Biden 2016 Long Island campaign chair for Barack Obama do you think you
633180	640100	are a reasonable unbiased source of information this is literal do to trust me bro levels of
640100	645340	sourcing pretty sure Trump boarded marine one with a portable oxygen concentrator in his pocket
645340	650860	with the nasal cannula was it can I don't know that is cannula going up his back hidden in his
650860	657260	hair and tucked under his mask he is not as well as they say liar-in-chief look at this dude look
657260	663220	at this fucking tweet like that this is just Trump being fat all right this is just Trump
663220	670020	being fat this is literally just a piece of hair you guys need to calm the fuck down man this is
670020	674300	not like a nothing tweet like this took off but yeah apparently he was feeling bad enough that
674300	679500	he had to go to the hospital so he hopped on marine one and went out there and the media
679500	683900	wasn't happy about it here's CNN's chief White House correspondent Trump did not stop for questions
684420	690860	dude he's got fucking coronavirus he's going to the hospital fuck you this is from the physician
690860	695540	to the president this afternoon in consultation with specialists from Walter Reed and John
695540	699980	Hopkins University I recommended movement of the president up to Walter Reed National Military
699980	704140	Medical Center for further monitoring this evening I'm happy to report the president is doing very
704140	708380	well he is not requiring any supplemental oxygen but in consultation with specialists we have
708380	713460	elected to initiate remdesivir therapy which I assume is some kind of therapy they've developed
713460	718780	for coronavirus he has completed his first dose and is resting at comfortably yeah back in June
718780	724140	remdesivir was being reported on as potentially a treatment for coronavirus it's normally an
724140	729620	Ebola medication so all right okay of course at the same time we were also getting this video so
729620	735020	geez who knows dude uh Jim you were there when the president walked out of the White House and
735020	740740	Border Marine one yeah I know you have some new reporting on his condition yeah Anderson I talked
740740	746580	to a Trump campaign advisor just a short while ago who said that this is serious that the
746580	753980	president has been having some trouble breathing that he's been very fatigued today very tired and
753980	759380	you know emphasized that you know this is not just a run-of-the-mill trip up to Walter Reed
759380	764140	that this is a serious situation talked to another source familiar with this situation this evening
764140	769420	who said that there are serious concerns among White House staffers about the president's
769420	776580	condition as a recording this is the most recent update on Trump's status which I mean there's so
776580	781020	much floating around right now from both sides people wanting him dead people like thinking
781020	784980	there's a conspiracy people saying that he's doomed people saying that he deserves it people
784980	788700	saying that he's he's on his deathbed and the government's hiding it people saying that he's
788700	793740	actually just fine like everything is being said right now but this clip is the most recent
793740	799940	concrete word that we have I recommended we bring the president up to Walter Reed as a
799940	808780	precautionary measure to provide state-of-the-art monitoring and any care that he may need just 72
808780	813580	hours into the diagnosis now the first week of kovat in a particular day 7 to 10 of the most
813580	820260	critical and determining the likely course of this illness at this time the team and I are extremely
820300	825180	happy with the progress the president has made Thursday he had a mild cough and some nasal
825180	831060	congestion and fatigue all of which are now resolving and improving nevermind while I was
831060	838300	editing this video this came out this is in fact the newest bit of information that we have from
838300	844340	Trump himself take a look I want to begin by thanking all of the incredible medical professionals
844500	850540	the doctors the nurses everybody at Walter Reed Medical Center I think it's the finest in the
850540	858540	world for the incredible job they've been doing I came here wasn't feeling so well I feel much
858540	864620	better now we're working hard to get me all the way back I have to be back because we still have
864620	871340	to make America great again we've done an awfully good job of that but we still have steps to go and
871340	878220	we have to finish that job and I'll be back I think I'll be back soon and I look forward to
878220	883420	finishing up the campaign the way it was started and the way we've been doing the kind of numbers
883420	888060	that we've been doing we've been so proud of it but this was something that happened and it's
888060	893780	happened to millions of people all over the world and I'm fighting for them not just in the US I'm
893780	898460	fighting for them all over the world we're gonna beat this coronavirus or whatever you want to call
898460	904900	it and we're gonna beat it soundly so many things have happened if you look at the therapeutics
904900	912380	which I'm taking right now some of them and others are coming out soon that are looking like frankly
912380	916620	they're miracles if you want to know the truth they're miracles people criticize me when I say
916620	922220	that but we have things happening that look like they're miracles coming down from God man he's
922220	926260	quite fatigued isn't he like I know that he's trying to hide it but his voice is a little bit
926300	933380	gravelier than usual he's slouched over in front of a table he's not standing up he's got like he's
933380	937780	not wearing a tie probably because of the fever I think he's trying to put on a brave face but I
937780	943540	actually do think he's quite sick damn so there we go I mean it's not unlike the situation when
943540	949660	Boris Johnson got coronavirus in the UK people treated him like shit too there was there was
949660	954820	tons of stuff going around on Twitter about it from the so-called more compassionate side of
954820	959060	politics that apparently cares a lot about everyone's health and well-being when it comes
959060	964860	to their political opponents they just don't give a shit I recall seeing nobody except the most vile
964860	973660	people on the right dancing on RBG's grave and yet it seems to be every single leftist like every
973660	979300	single leftist with a few only a few exceptions that are like I hope Trump dies dude hashtag
979300	983460	kovat caught Trump it's honestly disgusting it reminds me of the way that the old right
983460	988220	behaved during the Obama era when they wanted Obama dead however what people are focusing on
988220	994140	are Trump's behaviors leading up to his getting tested Trump kept his regular schedule after
994140	999420	learning his close aid Hope Hicks had kovat US President Donald Trump learned on Thursday
999420	1004180	morning that his aid Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus yet continued on with a full
1004180	1009420	schedule of events including a fundraiser at his New Jersey resort that raised five million dollars
1009460	1013860	Trump's movements are being closely scrutinized since he later tested positive for coronavirus
1013860	1019700	announcing the news shortly before 1 a.m. Friday Washington time the White House has not said when
1019700	1024540	Trump first tested positive for the virus but Trump said on late Thursday he was awaiting the
1024540	1029460	results in between learning the news of Hicks's infection Thursday morning and announcing his
1029460	1034420	own early Friday Trump stuck to his prepared schedule it is not known whether Trump was
1034420	1040220	tested Thursday morning after receiving the news of Hicks's positive test as soon as he found out
1040220	1045820	he was tested and as soon as he tested positive he went into quarantine said Larry Kudlow his
1045820	1050340	director of the National Economic Council I can't give you the chronology because I wasn't there on
1050340	1055140	Thursday Trump had no publicly scheduled events that morning after a late-night return from a
1055140	1059300	rally in Minnesota a trip that Hicks also attended she was separated from the rest of the White House
1059300	1064340	staff on Air Force One on the trip home Wednesday night after falling ill the press secretary
1064340	1068580	Kayleigh McKinney held a briefing shortly before noon on Thursday taking the podium without a mask
1068580	1073740	at that time she did not know Hicks had tested positive Trump left the White House at 1 p.m.
1073740	1078980	Thursday not stopping to speak to reporters before boarding his helicopter he flew on Air Force One
1078980	1083740	to New Jersey and then by helicopter into his Bedminster golf club before a fundraiser and this
1083780	1090380	seems to be the point of contention did Trump know that his aide Hope Hicks had been diagnosed by 1
1090380	1095020	p.m. on Thursday that's still something we don't really know the answer to just yet but what we do
1095020	1100180	know is that people online are losing their minds they're saying that Hope Hicks was a plant to try
1100180	1104580	to get the the president killed they're saying that Trump knew like two or three days ago he
1104580	1108500	just didn't care and he was going around speaking to everybody some people are saying Trump knew
1108500	1114580	before the debate like before you and Hope Hicks got it like crazy stuff right and none of this
1114580	1120100	has any proof from from either side it's all just literally people losing their minds and now they're
1120100	1125020	calling all of Trump's events like super spreader events and and stuff like this and it's like come
1125020	1130020	on you guys have been promoting these fucking riots where there's thousands of people out in
1130020	1134700	the streets throwing molotovs burning buildings down attacking people shooting people but anyway
1134700	1139820	like I always say we have to behave better than our opponents there is no reason to celebrate when
1139820	1145540	anyone gets coronavirus I would not be happy if Joe Biden caught it I would not be happy if Bernie
1145540	1150300	Sanders caught it and I'm not happy that Trump caught it I don't want my political opponents to
1150300	1154620	simply die but right now that is the attitude of a lot of people on the left and like I said
1154620	1159140	there's no surprise that attitude has manifested in street violence that has taken lives because
1159140	1163860	the honest truth is if you are at the point where you simply want your political opponents to die
1163860	1170540	there is no compromise with them there is no back and forth as lay socialist squirrels said there's
1170540	1176460	no marketplace of ideas it's all it all just boils down to class conflict eternal power struggle no
1176460	1182820	reasoning no coming together just fight until one side is completely extinguished if that is where
1182820	1187820	the left is right now then the only reason they haven't started a civil war yet is because they
1187820	1192100	are complete cowards and they know they would lose it is one thing to have a political opponent you
1192100	1196540	can debate with that you can compromise with that has a legitimate point of view that you can at
1196540	1202260	least understand if not agree with it's another thing entirely to have a political opponent that
1202260	1207940	simply wants you dead whether that's for racial reasons or class reasons or political reasons
1207940	1213620	doesn't matter if their baseline of politics truly is convert or die and they're too inept to
1213620	1218260	actually convert people and too cowardly to actually enforce the die part then they're
1218260	1223700	honestly just a bunch of fucking losers aren't they anyway let's hope Trump gets well let's
1223700	1228900	hope any leftist who catches the virus also gets well and let's please bring politics back to a
1228900	1234180	sensible location where we're not cheering for random chance to potentially kill those
1234180	1237460	that we disagree with please can we get back to that
