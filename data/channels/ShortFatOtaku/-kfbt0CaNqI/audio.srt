1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Before I get started guys, I want to point out that yes I have been demonetized, no I

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,160
have not been told why, I don't know what video did it, I don't know what part of what

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,540
video did it, they simply said hate speech and I don't know anything, I've been told

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,440
nothing by YouTube and frankly I might be financially fucked if this sticks.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,640
So please consider checking the description of this video because I've put links to support

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,680
the channel down there, they're also on screen too so if you want to financially support

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,740
what I'm doing, thank you very much.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,880
Again even in a time like this please don't feel obligated, I know people are out of jobs,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,040
I know people are getting sick, I know things are generally on a downturn for everyone,

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,520
before you give me anything make sure you take care of yourself okay?

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,220
By the way yesterday's video got a lot of people angry and I mean fair enough, but like

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,200
I've said I've always been neutral on Trump, I will give him the benefit of the doubt but

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,900
I will give anybody the benefit of the doubt, nobody's perfect.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,460
If you're subbed to this channel for unapologetic god emperor simping, you're in the wrong place

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,660
unfortunately.

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,000
That being said the main reason that I released it the time that I did is because basically

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,140
I had recorded it before my demonetization and frankly guys that kind of hit me pretty

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,380
hard I mean like motivationally you know?

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,160
I definitely just took some time off and you know it is actually a little bit harder to

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,220
get the gumption to do this sort of thing when you know that YouTube's still running

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,320
ads on your videos and just taking 100% of the revenue, but I took a couple days off

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,520
and I said you know I've got to do something I guess, I mean I have some kind of appeals

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,160
process working so hopefully it'll work out but in the meantime I've got to do something

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
right?

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,680
So I took this video that I had recorded you know a day or two earlier and I finally finished

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,140
the editing and put it out.

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,760
Of course bad timing because at the same time Donald Trump tested positive as well as his

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,640
wife for coronavirus.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,560
We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately we will get through this

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,280
together holy shit dude.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,040
Stock futures sharply fall after President Donald Trump tweets that he has tested positive

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
for coronavirus.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,440
Now this happened shortly after the debates and everyone was thinking oh no does Joe Biden

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
have coronavirus?

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
But it turns out that Joe Biden says or rather the person who runs his Twitter account because

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,280
we all know he doesn't actually use his own Twitter they say I'm happy to report that

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Jill and I have tested negative for COVID.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern I hope this serves as a reminder wear

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,120
a mask keep social distance and wash your hands unless you're going to a protest.

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,480
Of course not everyone is civil here's Ilhan Omar as someone who lost my own father to

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,960
this virus and seeing the pain it causes I don't wish on anyone.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,480
Over 200,000 people have now died while this administration actively ignores public health

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,280
guidance and suppresses science.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,320
For months we have been hoping for a simple acknowledgement from the president to hear

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,520
the words we will get through this together and now we only hear those words when it is

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,500
about him not the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their lives and the millions

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,320
whose families have been touched by it because of his malfeasance.

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,960
You know considering that you are a representative in the House you should understand that the

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,800
presidency the office of the presidency does not have the power to do the things you're

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,320
asking of it.

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,880
It's in the 10th amendment the states have to handle this the state governors the state

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,020
governments the president of the United States and Republicans in Minnesota are actively

53
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,240
spreading a deadly virus they are a risk to the public health of my constituents and our

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,300
country Republicans are the ones that are spreading the virus around not the protesters

55
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,400
and yes we're going to be going back to that protester well quite a bit because there's

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,240
going to be some serious problems here Republicans asking for decorum and empathy like they didn't

57
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,600
wish violence on protesters lmao also he's a white supremacist running a fascist government

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,960
and 209,000 people have died due to his mismanagement and peddling that it's a hoax I have zero

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,760
sympathy for these assholes it's pretty amazing you can you can tell who the people are that

60
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,120
don't actually get their news from multiple sources they get it from one ideological source

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040
or they just filter what they get through that ideological framework because you get

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,400
nonsense like this I know I'm not a Republican but I don't wish violence on protesters I

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
don't even wish violence on rioters I would rather the riot not happen I would rather

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,160
the riot stop before violence self-defensive violence becomes necessary but having the

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,420
fortitude to use violence to defend yourself does not mean that you wish for violence and

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,040
frankly these idiots don't know what fascism is like I recall the right calling Obama a

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,480
fascist back when the Democrats kept winning this happens all the fucking time it happens

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,200
every single every single election cycle every single time there's been like a presidential

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,120
shift the op the opposition is like all those guys are fashy taking away our rights and

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,520
it's like no no I mean Obama did some some terrible stuff obviously but no no one's a

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,800
fascist dude so just a quick question on a scale of one to ten is this your favorite

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:08,240
or most favorite October surprise in the history of electoral politics for me personally

73
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,960
I think it ranks pretty high up there but you know love to hear your thoughts but of

74
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,480
course we know it's not about civility to these people they think civility is white

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,320
supremacy or something it's entirely about power that is the point of the Marxist lens

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,760
is to frame everything in terms of power politics well more specifically class conflict but

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,440
that just boils down to power politics in reality for example a certain mold of liberal

78
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
sees the right as a jousting partner to have eternal sparring matches with in the effervescent

79
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,740
marketplace of ideas rather than a class enemy to be defeated by any means necessary and

80
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,220
most efficiently this explains a lot of their behavior this is because liberals understand

81
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,160
that their political opponents are generally not evil like sometimes you get the occasional

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,480
evil person but most of the time the real functional answer to any given problem is

83
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,640
somewhere between the liberal and conservative positions additionally most socialists and

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,500
most fascists probably aren't bad people either they're just horribly misguided but when everything

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,660
is class conflict when it all boils down to power politics when all war is a war over

86
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,420
material conditions this is the kind of brain-dead attitude that you get the reason that you

87
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,580
have eternal sparring matches within the marketplace of ideas is because none of us none of us

88
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,500
including the socialists know what the right answer is have no idea what the right answer

89
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,080
is some people think that they do some people think that they can take any topic but pick

90
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,160
up a pick a topic doesn't matter filter it through the Marxist lens and out comes a pre-packaged

91
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,840
proper answer for it but of course in reality that almost never actually works you find

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,420
the truth not by following a dogma but by taking every single fact you can and clashing

93
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,940
them against each other until what remains is a pure product the truth that is what the

94
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,940
marketplace of ideas is and that is why you need those eternal sparring matches to simply

95
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,580
view those who oppose you as your eternal enemy even in those cases where they're factually

96
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,140
correct means that you're not interested in truth you're interested in power and of course

97
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,960
this squirrel person here is kind of a known socialist on Twitter and they post their own

98
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,960
take along with some other takes from neo libs who are wishing Trump a speedy recovery

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,600
and the message is clear civility compromise coming to at the very least a reasonable understanding

100
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,960
if you don't always agree making up becoming friends again these things are the antithesis

101
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,840
of the idea that everything is power politics Trump went to Bedminster and exposed staff

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,280
and fundraiser attendees when he already knew he had COVID when he was already symptomatic

103
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,640
and receiving treatment dude this this isn't true man like we're gonna go over some articles

104
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,500
and some sources a little bit later but yeah this isn't true you don't need to all caps

105
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,700
a bunch of false shit and then make that go viral because people are just literally looking

106
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,480
for anything that they can grab onto at this point and seriously this is on both sides

107
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,600
like here's what Greg Gutfield said on Fox News to the point about the script being flipped

108
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,760
the reason why it flipped and maybe it's a flaw of Trump is that he didn't hide from

109
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,780
the virus the reason he didn't hide from the virus is that he didn't want America to hide

110
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,700
from the virus if he was going to ask America to get back to work and experience a risk he was

111
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,180
going to do the same thing so I think he put himself on the line and that the flaw being that

112
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,860
as an optimist as somebody who was trying to convey a message that we are going to get through

113
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,160
this and things are gonna be better he had to walk that walk and he had to do that you could

114
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,660
have scared the crap out of everybody but he refused and it goes back to his original point

115
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,860
about trying to make sure that the positive attitude is maintained along with a sense of

116
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,900
concern so he took the risk he got the virus but he was doing it for us this is some mega

117
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,500
cope dude come on like I definitely don't believe with the leftist point of view of shut down

118
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,860
everything forever this is the new normal if you don't wear the mask at all times even when you're

119
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,340
sleeping or having sex then you want grandma to die but at the same time I think this Trump got

120
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:02,100
sick for us kind of idea is is a bit stupid sometimes you get sick it's just how it is

121
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,300
sometimes you take precautions and get sick anyway and sometimes you don't take precautions

122
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,740
and you're fine the virus is not a entirely controllable variable here and it is a product

123
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,780
of our own arrogance to think that we can manage this any more than we have frankly and of course

124
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,220
we do have the mirror universe gaslighting from you know the usual sources this one's from the

125
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,820
Washington Post but they're all very similar after Trump's positive test conservative media

126
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,340
goes after liberal critics real and imagined you know if that happened I haven't really seen it

127
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,700
what I have seen is a lot of people who are saying lol I can't wait for Trump to die they're writing

128
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,620
their weird Trump fan fictions about how hopefully he's rotting away at the hospital and he's like on

129
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,540
life support for like the next 50 years or something and how RBG comes back from the dead

130
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,820
to go to the Supreme Court and then give the election to Biden or some nonsense like this it

131
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,060
is kind of crazy the the level of conspiracy theory I've seen online I wonder if we'll approach

132
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,300
QAnon levels maybe if Trump's in the hospital for a while like check this fucking clown I don't want

133
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,300
to be alarmist but a GOP source just told me this Trump's condition is serious he can go either way

134
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,820
despite all the meds and the presidential care they could lose him within three to four days

135
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,300
they're trying to make his condition look good to reassure his base I have no way to confirm this

136
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,020
report but I felt like I should pass it along of course you did you dude you're literally on team

137
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,500
Joe like look at this yeah hashtag team Joe formerly chair of the Democrat coalition national

138
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,140
finance chair for draft Biden 2016 Long Island campaign chair for Barack Obama do you think you

139
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:40,100
are a reasonable unbiased source of information this is literal do to trust me bro levels of

140
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,340
sourcing pretty sure Trump boarded marine one with a portable oxygen concentrator in his pocket

141
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,860
with the nasal cannula was it can I don't know that is cannula going up his back hidden in his

142
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,260
hair and tucked under his mask he is not as well as they say liar-in-chief look at this dude look

143
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,220
at this fucking tweet like that this is just Trump being fat all right this is just Trump

144
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,020
being fat this is literally just a piece of hair you guys need to calm the fuck down man this is

145
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,300
not like a nothing tweet like this took off but yeah apparently he was feeling bad enough that

146
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,500
he had to go to the hospital so he hopped on marine one and went out there and the media

147
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,900
wasn't happy about it here's CNN's chief White House correspondent Trump did not stop for questions

148
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,860
dude he's got fucking coronavirus he's going to the hospital fuck you this is from the physician

149
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,540
to the president this afternoon in consultation with specialists from Walter Reed and John

150
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,980
Hopkins University I recommended movement of the president up to Walter Reed National Military

151
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,140
Medical Center for further monitoring this evening I'm happy to report the president is doing very

152
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,380
well he is not requiring any supplemental oxygen but in consultation with specialists we have

153
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,460
elected to initiate remdesivir therapy which I assume is some kind of therapy they've developed

154
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,780
for coronavirus he has completed his first dose and is resting at comfortably yeah back in June

155
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,140
remdesivir was being reported on as potentially a treatment for coronavirus it's normally an

156
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,620
Ebola medication so all right okay of course at the same time we were also getting this video so

157
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,020
geez who knows dude uh Jim you were there when the president walked out of the White House and

158
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,740
Border Marine one yeah I know you have some new reporting on his condition yeah Anderson I talked

159
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,580
to a Trump campaign advisor just a short while ago who said that this is serious that the

160
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:33,980
president has been having some trouble breathing that he's been very fatigued today very tired and

161
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,380
you know emphasized that you know this is not just a run-of-the-mill trip up to Walter Reed

162
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,140
that this is a serious situation talked to another source familiar with this situation this evening

163
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,420
who said that there are serious concerns among White House staffers about the president's

164
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:56,580
condition as a recording this is the most recent update on Trump's status which I mean there's so

165
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,020
much floating around right now from both sides people wanting him dead people like thinking

166
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,980
there's a conspiracy people saying that he's doomed people saying that he deserves it people

167
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,700
saying that he's he's on his deathbed and the government's hiding it people saying that he's

168
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,740
actually just fine like everything is being said right now but this clip is the most recent

169
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,940
concrete word that we have I recommended we bring the president up to Walter Reed as a

170
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:28,780
precautionary measure to provide state-of-the-art monitoring and any care that he may need just 72

171
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,580
hours into the diagnosis now the first week of kovat in a particular day 7 to 10 of the most

172
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:40,260
critical and determining the likely course of this illness at this time the team and I are extremely

173
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,180
happy with the progress the president has made Thursday he had a mild cough and some nasal

174
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,060
congestion and fatigue all of which are now resolving and improving nevermind while I was

175
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:58,300
editing this video this came out this is in fact the newest bit of information that we have from

176
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,340
Trump himself take a look I want to begin by thanking all of the incredible medical professionals

177
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,540
the doctors the nurses everybody at Walter Reed Medical Center I think it's the finest in the

178
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:18,540
world for the incredible job they've been doing I came here wasn't feeling so well I feel much

179
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,620
better now we're working hard to get me all the way back I have to be back because we still have

180
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,340
to make America great again we've done an awfully good job of that but we still have steps to go and

181
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:38,220
we have to finish that job and I'll be back I think I'll be back soon and I look forward to

182
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,420
finishing up the campaign the way it was started and the way we've been doing the kind of numbers

183
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,060
that we've been doing we've been so proud of it but this was something that happened and it's

184
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,780
happened to millions of people all over the world and I'm fighting for them not just in the US I'm

185
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,460
fighting for them all over the world we're gonna beat this coronavirus or whatever you want to call

186
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,900
it and we're gonna beat it soundly so many things have happened if you look at the therapeutics

187
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,380
which I'm taking right now some of them and others are coming out soon that are looking like frankly

188
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,620
they're miracles if you want to know the truth they're miracles people criticize me when I say

189
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,220
that but we have things happening that look like they're miracles coming down from God man he's

190
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,260
quite fatigued isn't he like I know that he's trying to hide it but his voice is a little bit

191
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,380
gravelier than usual he's slouched over in front of a table he's not standing up he's got like he's

192
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,780
not wearing a tie probably because of the fever I think he's trying to put on a brave face but I

193
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,540
actually do think he's quite sick damn so there we go I mean it's not unlike the situation when

194
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,660
Boris Johnson got coronavirus in the UK people treated him like shit too there was there was

195
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,820
tons of stuff going around on Twitter about it from the so-called more compassionate side of

196
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,060
politics that apparently cares a lot about everyone's health and well-being when it comes

197
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,860
to their political opponents they just don't give a shit I recall seeing nobody except the most vile

198
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:13,660
people on the right dancing on RBG's grave and yet it seems to be every single leftist like every

199
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,300
single leftist with a few only a few exceptions that are like I hope Trump dies dude hashtag

200
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,460
kovat caught Trump it's honestly disgusting it reminds me of the way that the old right

201
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,220
behaved during the Obama era when they wanted Obama dead however what people are focusing on

202
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,140
are Trump's behaviors leading up to his getting tested Trump kept his regular schedule after

203
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,420
learning his close aid Hope Hicks had kovat US President Donald Trump learned on Thursday

204
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,180
morning that his aid Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus yet continued on with a full

205
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,420
schedule of events including a fundraiser at his New Jersey resort that raised five million dollars

206
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,860
Trump's movements are being closely scrutinized since he later tested positive for coronavirus

207
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:59,700
announcing the news shortly before 1 a.m. Friday Washington time the White House has not said when

208
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,540
Trump first tested positive for the virus but Trump said on late Thursday he was awaiting the

209
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,460
results in between learning the news of Hicks's infection Thursday morning and announcing his

210
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,420
own early Friday Trump stuck to his prepared schedule it is not known whether Trump was

211
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,220
tested Thursday morning after receiving the news of Hicks's positive test as soon as he found out

212
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,820
he was tested and as soon as he tested positive he went into quarantine said Larry Kudlow his

213
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,340
director of the National Economic Council I can't give you the chronology because I wasn't there on

214
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,140
Thursday Trump had no publicly scheduled events that morning after a late-night return from a

215
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,300
rally in Minnesota a trip that Hicks also attended she was separated from the rest of the White House

216
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,340
staff on Air Force One on the trip home Wednesday night after falling ill the press secretary

217
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,580
Kayleigh McKinney held a briefing shortly before noon on Thursday taking the podium without a mask

218
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,740
at that time she did not know Hicks had tested positive Trump left the White House at 1 p.m.

219
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,980
Thursday not stopping to speak to reporters before boarding his helicopter he flew on Air Force One

220
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,740
to New Jersey and then by helicopter into his Bedminster golf club before a fundraiser and this

221
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:10,380
seems to be the point of contention did Trump know that his aide Hope Hicks had been diagnosed by 1

222
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,020
p.m. on Thursday that's still something we don't really know the answer to just yet but what we do

223
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,180
know is that people online are losing their minds they're saying that Hope Hicks was a plant to try

224
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,580
to get the the president killed they're saying that Trump knew like two or three days ago he

225
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,500
just didn't care and he was going around speaking to everybody some people are saying Trump knew

226
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,580
before the debate like before you and Hope Hicks got it like crazy stuff right and none of this

227
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,100
has any proof from from either side it's all just literally people losing their minds and now they're

228
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,020
calling all of Trump's events like super spreader events and and stuff like this and it's like come

229
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,020
on you guys have been promoting these fucking riots where there's thousands of people out in

230
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,700
the streets throwing molotovs burning buildings down attacking people shooting people but anyway

231
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,820
like I always say we have to behave better than our opponents there is no reason to celebrate when

232
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,540
anyone gets coronavirus I would not be happy if Joe Biden caught it I would not be happy if Bernie

233
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,300
Sanders caught it and I'm not happy that Trump caught it I don't want my political opponents to

234
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,620
simply die but right now that is the attitude of a lot of people on the left and like I said

235
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,140
there's no surprise that attitude has manifested in street violence that has taken lives because

236
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,860
the honest truth is if you are at the point where you simply want your political opponents to die

237
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,540
there is no compromise with them there is no back and forth as lay socialist squirrels said there's

238
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,460
no marketplace of ideas it's all it all just boils down to class conflict eternal power struggle no

239
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,820
reasoning no coming together just fight until one side is completely extinguished if that is where

240
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,820
the left is right now then the only reason they haven't started a civil war yet is because they

241
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,100
are complete cowards and they know they would lose it is one thing to have a political opponent you

242
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,540
can debate with that you can compromise with that has a legitimate point of view that you can at

243
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,260
least understand if not agree with it's another thing entirely to have a political opponent that

244
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,940
simply wants you dead whether that's for racial reasons or class reasons or political reasons

245
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,620
doesn't matter if their baseline of politics truly is convert or die and they're too inept to

246
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,260
actually convert people and too cowardly to actually enforce the die part then they're

247
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,700
honestly just a bunch of fucking losers aren't they anyway let's hope Trump gets well let's

248
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,900
hope any leftist who catches the virus also gets well and let's please bring politics back to a

249
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,180
sensible location where we're not cheering for random chance to potentially kill those

250
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,460
that we disagree with please can we get back to that
