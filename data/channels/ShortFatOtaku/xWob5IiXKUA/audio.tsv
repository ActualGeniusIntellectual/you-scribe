0	9500	Have we reached the bottom of the barrel yet? Can the internet discourse machine churn out
9500	12940	something dumber than what we're going to talk about today? We almost made it to this
12940	17720	point with last year's Nyquil chicken challenge, but that was at least obviously stupid on
17720	22660	the face of it. But I did not know how deep the chicanery went. It all started with this
22660	23660	innocent TikTok.
23660	28980	This is a PSA to the seasoning police on this app. If in your brain you only view seasoning
28980	35800	as things like garlic powder, onion powder, or maybe something like rosemary. If this
35800	40380	is what you view as seasoning and seasoning only, let me pose you a question. What does
40380	45280	this come from? Granulated garlic. What is that? Garlic, onion powder. What does that
45280	52300	come from? Dehydrated onion. Let's take a look at the spice rub. Dehydrated garlic,
52300	58420	onion and bell pepper. I sauteed those bell peppers along with my onion and garlic. Hmm.
58420	62980	What is so funny to me is if I had just doused my chicken in this rub, in this rub alone,
62980	66780	the seasoning police would be out of my comments. They wouldn't even be in there. But the second
66780	71940	it's fresh garlic or fresh onion or fresh bell pepper, it's automatically not seasoning.
71940	75020	And let me just say one last thing. If you're one of those people that loves to watch cooking
75020	79500	competitions and a judge says something is under seasoned, they're talking about salt.
79500	83680	Under seasoning your food means there's not enough salt in it. Salt is going to bring
83680	88820	out the flavor of onion, the flavor of garlic, the flavor of whatever random spice rub that
88820	92280	you have. And let me just say that if your food tastes a little off, it's not because
92280	96740	you need to add more powder. It's most of the time because you need to add more salt
96740	101560	or some sort of acid like lemon juice or vinegar. Okay. Seems normal enough, right? It's just
101560	106240	a viral video of a cooking TikToker, Zoe Berry talking about seasoning chicken. She had been
106240	109600	getting a lot of flack about how she seasoned her chicken in her videos. So this was her
109600	115320	reply. And oh boy, the people who clapped did not like receiving clap back to the seasoning
115320	118680	police on this app.
118680	123640	So this came on my for you page. And I just don't know who the seasoning police is. And
123640	129120	I'm curious who is because the only people that I know season their food don't look like
129120	135280	her. That's the ongoing joke. And then what makes it worse is that when you read the comments,
135280	143920	the people defending her don't look like me or people that season their food. So no,
143920	148760	just seasoning police sounds a little racist.
148760	153400	Nobody's mentioned race, dude. It didn't matter that she was white and the people commenting
153400	158300	on her content were black until you and people like you made it matter. And there are a lot
158300	162280	of people out there who are really trying to make this into a race issue on both sides.
163280	169080	This is more genuinely white supremacist content than 99% of what Aryan Agartha Greiper accounts
169080	174320	put out. The way she said seasoning police was more powerfully racist than any slur I've
174320	178160	ever heard. And here's the same sentiment from the other side. This woman in one Tik
178160	183380	Tok has done more for the dissident right than any rad femme or trad poster on here.
183380	187040	These fuckers will do anything to make a conversation about race.
187040	190800	Most of my audience is American, so you guys probably know this. But just in case, it's
191320	194960	stereotype that black people in America have about white people that they don't season
194960	198760	their food whatsoever, that they just eat bland stuff like toast with butter or plain
198760	202680	tomato sauce with beans or something like that. This conversation has several dimensions
202680	207800	to it. Firstly, is the whole seasoning means a spicy thing. Best example of that is this
207800	213020	recently viral tweet where a black guy thought that baldak double spicy ramen meant spicy
213020	217620	for white people. Now, to be fair, there absolutely is that segment of people in our culture who
217620	222220	are generally white and generally can't deal with spicy food. My mom is a great example.
222220	226320	But when I was dating a girl from China, I basically had to learn to enjoy spicy food.
226320	230260	And though it's good, it really is an acquired taste. I enjoy it now, but I absolutely had
230260	233860	to work to pick it up. I can understand why people wouldn't want to. It can definitely
233860	238280	be a painful experience. But man, this idea that only black Americans know about spicy
238280	242760	food is just wild to me. And I'm not only talking about Asian spicy noodles or Indian
242760	247260	curry or something. You can find some of the spiciest cuisine in the world by eating at
247300	251140	an authentically hot wing joint. And that stuff comes straight out of the southern BBQ
251140	255300	repertoire, a culture that is quite well known for being very white. Secondly, anybody who's
255300	260140	eaten authentic French food or Italian food will know that what we're calling white people
260140	263700	absolutely know about seasoning. Yeah, on the surface level, the British don't seem
263700	266980	to. But remember, they colonize the world to get at the spice trade. They also know
266980	271260	what's going on. This idea that white people food is unspiced came about due to, believe
271260	276060	it or not, the Cold War. Seriously. Do you know what a stereotypical frozen dinner consists
276060	280900	of? Mashed potatoes flavored with butter, a slab of meat, generally steak, lightly seasoned,
280900	285180	and boiled vegetables. Not exactly the most appetizing meal, but it will do in a pinch.
285180	289700	There's a reason for that. Cold War era America had restructured a lot of its society in order
289700	293900	to try and survive a nuclear holocaust. For example, the original creation of the suburb
293900	297900	as a mode of living was in part due to the American government not wanting all of its
297900	302820	population to exist in tightly packed cities that could be nuked off the face of the map.
302820	306980	American sprawl was a cynical way to ensure that at least some Americans survived in the
306980	310980	face of Armageddon, by virtue of being so spread out. The Cold War affected a lot of
310980	316020	American trends in this way. American culture took on this individualistic, quasi-utilitarian
316020	320200	preparedness and the foods were no different. Easy to store, easy to cook, able to keep
320200	324200	you alive. Taste was not the primary concern. And you can see this reflected in the culture
324200	329020	of the time. The reason that finding 200-year-old boxes of powdered mashed potatoes in fallout
329020	334700	is so funny is because just-add-water foods were a Cold War prepper staple. Same with
334700	339340	spam, hot dogs, beans, vegetables, all stuff you could can and store in your underground
339340	344260	bunker and eat at a later date while the wasteland sheds its radiation above you. Meat and potatoes
344260	348420	stuck around as an American staple, even after the immediate threat of the Cold War receded
348420	351700	and became the basis of the white people food stereotype.
351700	355960	And this leads to my third point. Bland food is actually sometimes pretty good. Yes, I
355960	360000	absolutely loved my Chinese girlfriend's authentic spicy chicken. I learned to cook
360000	364280	it myself, and I still cook it occasionally now, even though she's long gone. But I
364280	368200	also like bland foods too. Sometimes I feel like a really spicy stir-fry. Sometimes I
368200	371840	just want a slice of toast or a hot dog with ketchup or something. Sometimes a slab of
371840	376680	properly grilled meat is way better than over-spicing it with way too much nonsense because you
376680	380560	don't want to look like a male monkey. By the way, male monkey is a racial slur referring
380560	385080	to white people who only eat bland food. But funnily enough, in the wild, I've only ever
385080	389720	heard progressive, self-hating white women use it to refer to other whites. I'm sure
389720	392760	there are some racist black people out there who have said it, but I've never bumped
392760	396960	into them personally. Funny how that works. But for some reason, these dumb fucks can't
396960	401580	help but start the next great spice war. From the Twitter account rightwingcope, because
401580	406760	of course it is, what in the caucasian is this? Absolutely no seasoning in sight. Oh
406760	412080	no, my friend, you poor delicate little retard. You have no idea what is about to happen to
412080	413920	you. Let's roll the clips.
413920	417600	First up, you want to watch Step 1 on how to make authentic black American fried chicken?
417600	421020	You wash it. And no, I don't mean a quick rinse of any possible chicken goop in your
421020	425080	dirty sink. In the dirty sink, specifically, guys. You should have a clean sink in a dirty
425080	428800	sink while cooking. What I'm talking about is, you scrub those motherfuckers with dish
428800	451600	soap. Seriously, dish soap? What do you think you're accomplishing here? At least this
451600	456000	guy is using vinegar, and vinegar is at least edible. Wait, no, he's also using dish soap
456000	459680	with the vinegar. Alright, check this one out. She's really pouring it on, like the
459680	464200	dish soap is bbq sauce or some shit. And then she's scrubbing it with the sponge, like what
464200	468960	the fuck, why? This has to be a joke, right? This can't be real. This has to be a troll.
468960	472800	She's scrubbing it. She's scrubbing it like I scrub a fucking dirty grease covered pan.
472800	476400	What the fuck? Listen, I am never going to take any shit from people like this who are
476400	479560	saying white people don't know they season and ever again, what the fuck?
479560	493680	That's bleach, bitch. You're pouring fucking bleach in the chicken. Okay, I have to believe
493680	497200	this is a troll. It's pretty funny if it's a troll. She's saying stuff like it won't
497200	501720	taste right if it's not brand name bleach. Okay, you got me. Fuck, if it's not a troll
501720	505960	though, what are you going to do next? Wash it in CLR? Jesus Christ. All I can say at
505960	510440	this point is I'm glad we are moving towards tagging restaurants as black owned.
510440	514200	A side conversation on all of this revolved around whether or not you should rinse your
514200	517940	chicken, not wash with fucking soap or bleach or the blood of virgins or whatever. Just
517940	521540	rinse off the chicken goop with water after you pull it out of the package. Some people
521540	524560	think that the germs of the chicken are in the chicken slime and that rinsing the slime
524560	529120	off the chicken cleans it, which is wrong. The CDC has a handy guide about why you need
529120	533320	to cook the chicken to an internal temperature of 165 freedom degrees and how rinsing the
533320	537100	chicken in the sink often leads to the chicken germs sticking around the sink basin where
537100	540280	they will then go on to contaminate other dishes or food that you put into it. I'm
540280	544720	of two minds about this because one, yes, that is absolutely true, but also I've experimented.
544720	548960	I've both rinsed chicken and not rinsed chicken before and I've noticed differences.
548960	552360	Keeping the packaged chicken slime on the chicken does affect the taste in a way that
552360	556640	I personally don't like. In my experience, it also prevents spices or sauces from sticking
556640	559840	to the meat, but you know what solves that? Adding a little bit of oil or butter. There
559840	564080	are times when I have rinsed with water and not washed with soap, you fucking degenerates,
564080	569040	a piece of meat before cooking it. But even when I do that, I follow the cardinal rule of cooking,
569040	574800	maintain two sinks. Like I said before, you need a clean sink and a dirty sink to properly cook at
574800	579900	least some dishes and you must ensure there is no crossover. But for nine times out of ten,
579900	585160	rinsing the meat is just not necessary, guys, despite any personal taste preferences. The
585160	589480	ultimate black pill on this topic is when you discover that a lot of cultures that developed
589520	594640	ritualistic washing of food, as well as overspicing and overcooking, did so because due to a
594640	599520	combination of climate and food scarcity, they tended to eat stuff that was potentially rotting
599520	603840	due to lack of other options. And all of this stems from the fact that washing and coating
603840	607920	your meat to the point that it's unrecognizable was a way of getting people to actually eat it.
607920	612600	This helped lead to a belief that the only way to season meat is to cover it in dried spices,
612600	616840	stuff that is visibly granular. And while this is obviously one way of doing it, it's amazing
616840	621760	just how ignorant these people are. This woman is putting her chicken onto a bed of vegetables
621760	625880	and herbs for roasting, coating it in a fresh garlic rub. And check out the replies she got.
625880	630080	Where's the seasoning? Salt is a good start, lol. But I mean, do you use pepper, paprika,
630080	634960	garlic or onion, salt or powder, herb seasoning, polo seasoning, anything? Do you think it's only
634960	639440	real seasoning if you get it out of a jar? They added salt, lol, that's it. This goes all the
639440	643760	way back to the original video where Zoe Berry explained that garlic powder comes from fucking
643760	647960	garlic. Or we could all just be wrong about this. And instead, we're all just racists.
647960	652920	Here's the alternative hypothesis. White people not seasoning their food actually really is based
652920	657760	in racism and classism, lol. The reason white people don't season food is because historically,
657760	662280	rich white people began to think seasoning was for brown people who had to season their food
662280	666520	because they couldn't afford better tasting meat. They associated unseasoned food with cleanliness
666520	671440	and moral purity, calling it clean or simple eating. In medieval Europe, the rich felt that
671440	675640	once spices became affordable for everyone instead of just the wealthy, they no longer wanted them.
675640	679720	So basically, white people don't season their food because their ancestors thought seasoning
679720	684000	was for poor people and brown people, lol. That's right, guys. Are you a white supremacist because
684000	688280	you don't want to eat rotten food and be shitting your guts out all night? If avoiding salmonella
688280	692440	means that I'm part of the Third Reich, well, at least I get a cool uniform out of it. In any case,
692440	696080	I have no idea how to end this video. Just remember that seasoning police is now a new
696080	699080	racial slur and donate money to the subscribe star or something. Okay, bye.
