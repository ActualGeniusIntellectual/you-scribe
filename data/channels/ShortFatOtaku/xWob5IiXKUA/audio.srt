1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Have we reached the bottom of the barrel yet? Can the internet discourse machine churn out

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,940
something dumber than what we're going to talk about today? We almost made it to this

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,720
point with last year's Nyquil chicken challenge, but that was at least obviously stupid on

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,660
the face of it. But I did not know how deep the chicanery went. It all started with this

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,660
innocent TikTok.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,980
This is a PSA to the seasoning police on this app. If in your brain you only view seasoning

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,800
as things like garlic powder, onion powder, or maybe something like rosemary. If this

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,380
is what you view as seasoning and seasoning only, let me pose you a question. What does

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,280
this come from? Granulated garlic. What is that? Garlic, onion powder. What does that

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,300
come from? Dehydrated onion. Let's take a look at the spice rub. Dehydrated garlic,

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,420
onion and bell pepper. I sauteed those bell peppers along with my onion and garlic. Hmm.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,980
What is so funny to me is if I had just doused my chicken in this rub, in this rub alone,

13
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,780
the seasoning police would be out of my comments. They wouldn't even be in there. But the second

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,940
it's fresh garlic or fresh onion or fresh bell pepper, it's automatically not seasoning.

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,020
And let me just say one last thing. If you're one of those people that loves to watch cooking

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,500
competitions and a judge says something is under seasoned, they're talking about salt.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,680
Under seasoning your food means there's not enough salt in it. Salt is going to bring

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,820
out the flavor of onion, the flavor of garlic, the flavor of whatever random spice rub that

19
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,280
you have. And let me just say that if your food tastes a little off, it's not because

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,740
you need to add more powder. It's most of the time because you need to add more salt

21
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,560
or some sort of acid like lemon juice or vinegar. Okay. Seems normal enough, right? It's just

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,240
a viral video of a cooking TikToker, Zoe Berry talking about seasoning chicken. She had been

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,600
getting a lot of flack about how she seasoned her chicken in her videos. So this was her

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,320
reply. And oh boy, the people who clapped did not like receiving clap back to the seasoning

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,680
police on this app.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,640
So this came on my for you page. And I just don't know who the seasoning police is. And

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,120
I'm curious who is because the only people that I know season their food don't look like

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,280
her. That's the ongoing joke. And then what makes it worse is that when you read the comments,

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,920
the people defending her don't look like me or people that season their food. So no,

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,760
just seasoning police sounds a little racist.

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,400
Nobody's mentioned race, dude. It didn't matter that she was white and the people commenting

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,300
on her content were black until you and people like you made it matter. And there are a lot

33
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,280
of people out there who are really trying to make this into a race issue on both sides.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,080
This is more genuinely white supremacist content than 99% of what Aryan Agartha Greiper accounts

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,320
put out. The way she said seasoning police was more powerfully racist than any slur I've

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,160
ever heard. And here's the same sentiment from the other side. This woman in one Tik

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,380
Tok has done more for the dissident right than any rad femme or trad poster on here.

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,040
These fuckers will do anything to make a conversation about race.

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
Most of my audience is American, so you guys probably know this. But just in case, it's

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,960
stereotype that black people in America have about white people that they don't season

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,760
their food whatsoever, that they just eat bland stuff like toast with butter or plain

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,680
tomato sauce with beans or something like that. This conversation has several dimensions

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,800
to it. Firstly, is the whole seasoning means a spicy thing. Best example of that is this

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,020
recently viral tweet where a black guy thought that baldak double spicy ramen meant spicy

45
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,620
for white people. Now, to be fair, there absolutely is that segment of people in our culture who

46
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,220
are generally white and generally can't deal with spicy food. My mom is a great example.

47
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,320
But when I was dating a girl from China, I basically had to learn to enjoy spicy food.

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,260
And though it's good, it really is an acquired taste. I enjoy it now, but I absolutely had

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,860
to work to pick it up. I can understand why people wouldn't want to. It can definitely

50
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,280
be a painful experience. But man, this idea that only black Americans know about spicy

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,760
food is just wild to me. And I'm not only talking about Asian spicy noodles or Indian

52
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,260
curry or something. You can find some of the spiciest cuisine in the world by eating at

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,140
an authentically hot wing joint. And that stuff comes straight out of the southern BBQ

54
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,300
repertoire, a culture that is quite well known for being very white. Secondly, anybody who's

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,140
eaten authentic French food or Italian food will know that what we're calling white people

56
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,700
absolutely know about seasoning. Yeah, on the surface level, the British don't seem

57
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,980
to. But remember, they colonize the world to get at the spice trade. They also know

58
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,260
what's going on. This idea that white people food is unspiced came about due to, believe

59
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,060
it or not, the Cold War. Seriously. Do you know what a stereotypical frozen dinner consists

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,900
of? Mashed potatoes flavored with butter, a slab of meat, generally steak, lightly seasoned,

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,180
and boiled vegetables. Not exactly the most appetizing meal, but it will do in a pinch.

62
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,700
There's a reason for that. Cold War era America had restructured a lot of its society in order

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,900
to try and survive a nuclear holocaust. For example, the original creation of the suburb

64
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,900
as a mode of living was in part due to the American government not wanting all of its

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,820
population to exist in tightly packed cities that could be nuked off the face of the map.

66
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,980
American sprawl was a cynical way to ensure that at least some Americans survived in the

67
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,980
face of Armageddon, by virtue of being so spread out. The Cold War affected a lot of

68
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,020
American trends in this way. American culture took on this individualistic, quasi-utilitarian

69
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,200
preparedness and the foods were no different. Easy to store, easy to cook, able to keep

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,200
you alive. Taste was not the primary concern. And you can see this reflected in the culture

71
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,020
of the time. The reason that finding 200-year-old boxes of powdered mashed potatoes in fallout

72
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,700
is so funny is because just-add-water foods were a Cold War prepper staple. Same with

73
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,340
spam, hot dogs, beans, vegetables, all stuff you could can and store in your underground

74
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,260
bunker and eat at a later date while the wasteland sheds its radiation above you. Meat and potatoes

75
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,420
stuck around as an American staple, even after the immediate threat of the Cold War receded

76
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,700
and became the basis of the white people food stereotype.

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,960
And this leads to my third point. Bland food is actually sometimes pretty good. Yes, I

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,000
absolutely loved my Chinese girlfriend's authentic spicy chicken. I learned to cook

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,280
it myself, and I still cook it occasionally now, even though she's long gone. But I

80
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,200
also like bland foods too. Sometimes I feel like a really spicy stir-fry. Sometimes I

81
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,840
just want a slice of toast or a hot dog with ketchup or something. Sometimes a slab of

82
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,680
properly grilled meat is way better than over-spicing it with way too much nonsense because you

83
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,560
don't want to look like a male monkey. By the way, male monkey is a racial slur referring

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,080
to white people who only eat bland food. But funnily enough, in the wild, I've only ever

85
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,720
heard progressive, self-hating white women use it to refer to other whites. I'm sure

86
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,760
there are some racist black people out there who have said it, but I've never bumped

87
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,960
into them personally. Funny how that works. But for some reason, these dumb fucks can't

88
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,580
help but start the next great spice war. From the Twitter account rightwingcope, because

89
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,760
of course it is, what in the caucasian is this? Absolutely no seasoning in sight. Oh

90
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,080
no, my friend, you poor delicate little retard. You have no idea what is about to happen to

91
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,920
you. Let's roll the clips.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,600
First up, you want to watch Step 1 on how to make authentic black American fried chicken?

93
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,020
You wash it. And no, I don't mean a quick rinse of any possible chicken goop in your

94
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,080
dirty sink. In the dirty sink, specifically, guys. You should have a clean sink in a dirty

95
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,800
sink while cooking. What I'm talking about is, you scrub those motherfuckers with dish

96
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:31,600
soap. Seriously, dish soap? What do you think you're accomplishing here? At least this

97
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,000
guy is using vinegar, and vinegar is at least edible. Wait, no, he's also using dish soap

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
with the vinegar. Alright, check this one out. She's really pouring it on, like the

99
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,200
dish soap is bbq sauce or some shit. And then she's scrubbing it with the sponge, like what

100
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,960
the fuck, why? This has to be a joke, right? This can't be real. This has to be a troll.

101
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
She's scrubbing it. She's scrubbing it like I scrub a fucking dirty grease covered pan.

102
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
What the fuck? Listen, I am never going to take any shit from people like this who are

103
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,560
saying white people don't know they season and ever again, what the fuck?

104
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:13,680
That's bleach, bitch. You're pouring fucking bleach in the chicken. Okay, I have to believe

105
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,200
this is a troll. It's pretty funny if it's a troll. She's saying stuff like it won't

106
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,720
taste right if it's not brand name bleach. Okay, you got me. Fuck, if it's not a troll

107
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,960
though, what are you going to do next? Wash it in CLR? Jesus Christ. All I can say at

108
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,440
this point is I'm glad we are moving towards tagging restaurants as black owned.

109
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,200
A side conversation on all of this revolved around whether or not you should rinse your

110
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,940
chicken, not wash with fucking soap or bleach or the blood of virgins or whatever. Just

111
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,540
rinse off the chicken goop with water after you pull it out of the package. Some people

112
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,560
think that the germs of the chicken are in the chicken slime and that rinsing the slime

113
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,120
off the chicken cleans it, which is wrong. The CDC has a handy guide about why you need

114
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,320
to cook the chicken to an internal temperature of 165 freedom degrees and how rinsing the

115
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,100
chicken in the sink often leads to the chicken germs sticking around the sink basin where

116
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,280
they will then go on to contaminate other dishes or food that you put into it. I'm

117
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,720
of two minds about this because one, yes, that is absolutely true, but also I've experimented.

118
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,960
I've both rinsed chicken and not rinsed chicken before and I've noticed differences.

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,360
Keeping the packaged chicken slime on the chicken does affect the taste in a way that

120
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,640
I personally don't like. In my experience, it also prevents spices or sauces from sticking

121
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,840
to the meat, but you know what solves that? Adding a little bit of oil or butter. There

122
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,080
are times when I have rinsed with water and not washed with soap, you fucking degenerates,

123
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,040
a piece of meat before cooking it. But even when I do that, I follow the cardinal rule of cooking,

124
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,800
maintain two sinks. Like I said before, you need a clean sink and a dirty sink to properly cook at

125
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,900
least some dishes and you must ensure there is no crossover. But for nine times out of ten,

126
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,160
rinsing the meat is just not necessary, guys, despite any personal taste preferences. The

127
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,480
ultimate black pill on this topic is when you discover that a lot of cultures that developed

128
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,640
ritualistic washing of food, as well as overspicing and overcooking, did so because due to a

129
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,520
combination of climate and food scarcity, they tended to eat stuff that was potentially rotting

130
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,840
due to lack of other options. And all of this stems from the fact that washing and coating

131
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,920
your meat to the point that it's unrecognizable was a way of getting people to actually eat it.

132
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,600
This helped lead to a belief that the only way to season meat is to cover it in dried spices,

133
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,840
stuff that is visibly granular. And while this is obviously one way of doing it, it's amazing

134
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,760
just how ignorant these people are. This woman is putting her chicken onto a bed of vegetables

135
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,880
and herbs for roasting, coating it in a fresh garlic rub. And check out the replies she got.

136
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,080
Where's the seasoning? Salt is a good start, lol. But I mean, do you use pepper, paprika,

137
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,960
garlic or onion, salt or powder, herb seasoning, polo seasoning, anything? Do you think it's only

138
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,440
real seasoning if you get it out of a jar? They added salt, lol, that's it. This goes all the

139
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
way back to the original video where Zoe Berry explained that garlic powder comes from fucking

140
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,960
garlic. Or we could all just be wrong about this. And instead, we're all just racists.

141
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,920
Here's the alternative hypothesis. White people not seasoning their food actually really is based

142
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,760
in racism and classism, lol. The reason white people don't season food is because historically,

143
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,280
rich white people began to think seasoning was for brown people who had to season their food

144
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,520
because they couldn't afford better tasting meat. They associated unseasoned food with cleanliness

145
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,440
and moral purity, calling it clean or simple eating. In medieval Europe, the rich felt that

146
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,640
once spices became affordable for everyone instead of just the wealthy, they no longer wanted them.

147
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,720
So basically, white people don't season their food because their ancestors thought seasoning

148
