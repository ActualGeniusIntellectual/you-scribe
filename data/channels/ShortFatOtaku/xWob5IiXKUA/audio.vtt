00:00.000 --> 00:09.500
Have we reached the bottom of the barrel yet? Can the internet discourse machine churn out

00:09.500 --> 00:12.940
something dumber than what we're going to talk about today? We almost made it to this

00:12.940 --> 00:17.720
point with last year's Nyquil chicken challenge, but that was at least obviously stupid on

00:17.720 --> 00:22.660
the face of it. But I did not know how deep the chicanery went. It all started with this

00:22.660 --> 00:23.660
innocent TikTok.

00:23.660 --> 00:28.980
This is a PSA to the seasoning police on this app. If in your brain you only view seasoning

00:28.980 --> 00:35.800
as things like garlic powder, onion powder, or maybe something like rosemary. If this

00:35.800 --> 00:40.380
is what you view as seasoning and seasoning only, let me pose you a question. What does

00:40.380 --> 00:45.280
this come from? Granulated garlic. What is that? Garlic, onion powder. What does that

00:45.280 --> 00:52.300
come from? Dehydrated onion. Let's take a look at the spice rub. Dehydrated garlic,

00:52.300 --> 00:58.420
onion and bell pepper. I sauteed those bell peppers along with my onion and garlic. Hmm.

00:58.420 --> 01:02.980
What is so funny to me is if I had just doused my chicken in this rub, in this rub alone,

01:02.980 --> 01:06.780
the seasoning police would be out of my comments. They wouldn't even be in there. But the second

01:06.780 --> 01:11.940
it's fresh garlic or fresh onion or fresh bell pepper, it's automatically not seasoning.

01:11.940 --> 01:15.020
And let me just say one last thing. If you're one of those people that loves to watch cooking

01:15.020 --> 01:19.500
competitions and a judge says something is under seasoned, they're talking about salt.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.680
Under seasoning your food means there's not enough salt in it. Salt is going to bring

01:23.680 --> 01:28.820
out the flavor of onion, the flavor of garlic, the flavor of whatever random spice rub that

01:28.820 --> 01:32.280
you have. And let me just say that if your food tastes a little off, it's not because

01:32.280 --> 01:36.740
you need to add more powder. It's most of the time because you need to add more salt

01:36.740 --> 01:41.560
or some sort of acid like lemon juice or vinegar. Okay. Seems normal enough, right? It's just

01:41.560 --> 01:46.240
a viral video of a cooking TikToker, Zoe Berry talking about seasoning chicken. She had been

01:46.240 --> 01:49.600
getting a lot of flack about how she seasoned her chicken in her videos. So this was her

01:49.600 --> 01:55.320
reply. And oh boy, the people who clapped did not like receiving clap back to the seasoning

01:55.320 --> 01:58.680
police on this app.

01:58.680 --> 02:03.640
So this came on my for you page. And I just don't know who the seasoning police is. And

02:03.640 --> 02:09.120
I'm curious who is because the only people that I know season their food don't look like

02:09.120 --> 02:15.280
her. That's the ongoing joke. And then what makes it worse is that when you read the comments,

02:15.280 --> 02:23.920
the people defending her don't look like me or people that season their food. So no,

02:23.920 --> 02:28.760
just seasoning police sounds a little racist.

02:28.760 --> 02:33.400
Nobody's mentioned race, dude. It didn't matter that she was white and the people commenting

02:33.400 --> 02:38.300
on her content were black until you and people like you made it matter. And there are a lot

02:38.300 --> 02:42.280
of people out there who are really trying to make this into a race issue on both sides.

02:43.280 --> 02:49.080
This is more genuinely white supremacist content than 99% of what Aryan Agartha Greiper accounts

02:49.080 --> 02:54.320
put out. The way she said seasoning police was more powerfully racist than any slur I've

02:54.320 --> 02:58.160
ever heard. And here's the same sentiment from the other side. This woman in one Tik

02:58.160 --> 03:03.380
Tok has done more for the dissident right than any rad femme or trad poster on here.

03:03.380 --> 03:07.040
These fuckers will do anything to make a conversation about race.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.800
Most of my audience is American, so you guys probably know this. But just in case, it's

03:11.320 --> 03:14.960
stereotype that black people in America have about white people that they don't season

03:14.960 --> 03:18.760
their food whatsoever, that they just eat bland stuff like toast with butter or plain

03:18.760 --> 03:22.680
tomato sauce with beans or something like that. This conversation has several dimensions

03:22.680 --> 03:27.800
to it. Firstly, is the whole seasoning means a spicy thing. Best example of that is this

03:27.800 --> 03:33.020
recently viral tweet where a black guy thought that baldak double spicy ramen meant spicy

03:33.020 --> 03:37.620
for white people. Now, to be fair, there absolutely is that segment of people in our culture who

03:37.620 --> 03:42.220
are generally white and generally can't deal with spicy food. My mom is a great example.

03:42.220 --> 03:46.320
But when I was dating a girl from China, I basically had to learn to enjoy spicy food.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.260
And though it's good, it really is an acquired taste. I enjoy it now, but I absolutely had

03:50.260 --> 03:53.860
to work to pick it up. I can understand why people wouldn't want to. It can definitely

03:53.860 --> 03:58.280
be a painful experience. But man, this idea that only black Americans know about spicy

03:58.280 --> 04:02.760
food is just wild to me. And I'm not only talking about Asian spicy noodles or Indian

04:02.760 --> 04:07.260
curry or something. You can find some of the spiciest cuisine in the world by eating at

04:07.300 --> 04:11.140
an authentically hot wing joint. And that stuff comes straight out of the southern BBQ

04:11.140 --> 04:15.300
repertoire, a culture that is quite well known for being very white. Secondly, anybody who's

04:15.300 --> 04:20.140
eaten authentic French food or Italian food will know that what we're calling white people

04:20.140 --> 04:23.700
absolutely know about seasoning. Yeah, on the surface level, the British don't seem

04:23.700 --> 04:26.980
to. But remember, they colonize the world to get at the spice trade. They also know

04:26.980 --> 04:31.260
what's going on. This idea that white people food is unspiced came about due to, believe

04:31.260 --> 04:36.060
it or not, the Cold War. Seriously. Do you know what a stereotypical frozen dinner consists

04:36.060 --> 04:40.900
of? Mashed potatoes flavored with butter, a slab of meat, generally steak, lightly seasoned,

04:40.900 --> 04:45.180
and boiled vegetables. Not exactly the most appetizing meal, but it will do in a pinch.

04:45.180 --> 04:49.700
There's a reason for that. Cold War era America had restructured a lot of its society in order

04:49.700 --> 04:53.900
to try and survive a nuclear holocaust. For example, the original creation of the suburb

04:53.900 --> 04:57.900
as a mode of living was in part due to the American government not wanting all of its

04:57.900 --> 05:02.820
population to exist in tightly packed cities that could be nuked off the face of the map.

05:02.820 --> 05:06.980
American sprawl was a cynical way to ensure that at least some Americans survived in the

05:06.980 --> 05:10.980
face of Armageddon, by virtue of being so spread out. The Cold War affected a lot of

05:10.980 --> 05:16.020
American trends in this way. American culture took on this individualistic, quasi-utilitarian

05:16.020 --> 05:20.200
preparedness and the foods were no different. Easy to store, easy to cook, able to keep

05:20.200 --> 05:24.200
you alive. Taste was not the primary concern. And you can see this reflected in the culture

05:24.200 --> 05:29.020
of the time. The reason that finding 200-year-old boxes of powdered mashed potatoes in fallout

05:29.020 --> 05:34.700
is so funny is because just-add-water foods were a Cold War prepper staple. Same with

05:34.700 --> 05:39.340
spam, hot dogs, beans, vegetables, all stuff you could can and store in your underground

05:39.340 --> 05:44.260
bunker and eat at a later date while the wasteland sheds its radiation above you. Meat and potatoes

05:44.260 --> 05:48.420
stuck around as an American staple, even after the immediate threat of the Cold War receded

05:48.420 --> 05:51.700
and became the basis of the white people food stereotype.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.960
And this leads to my third point. Bland food is actually sometimes pretty good. Yes, I

05:55.960 --> 06:00.000
absolutely loved my Chinese girlfriend's authentic spicy chicken. I learned to cook

06:00.000 --> 06:04.280
it myself, and I still cook it occasionally now, even though she's long gone. But I

06:04.280 --> 06:08.200
also like bland foods too. Sometimes I feel like a really spicy stir-fry. Sometimes I

06:08.200 --> 06:11.840
just want a slice of toast or a hot dog with ketchup or something. Sometimes a slab of

06:11.840 --> 06:16.680
properly grilled meat is way better than over-spicing it with way too much nonsense because you

06:16.680 --> 06:20.560
don't want to look like a male monkey. By the way, male monkey is a racial slur referring

06:20.560 --> 06:25.080
to white people who only eat bland food. But funnily enough, in the wild, I've only ever

06:25.080 --> 06:29.720
heard progressive, self-hating white women use it to refer to other whites. I'm sure

06:29.720 --> 06:32.760
there are some racist black people out there who have said it, but I've never bumped

06:32.760 --> 06:36.960
into them personally. Funny how that works. But for some reason, these dumb fucks can't

06:36.960 --> 06:41.580
help but start the next great spice war. From the Twitter account rightwingcope, because

06:41.580 --> 06:46.760
of course it is, what in the caucasian is this? Absolutely no seasoning in sight. Oh

06:46.760 --> 06:52.080
no, my friend, you poor delicate little retard. You have no idea what is about to happen to

06:52.080 --> 06:53.920
you. Let's roll the clips.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.600
First up, you want to watch Step 1 on how to make authentic black American fried chicken?

06:57.600 --> 07:01.020
You wash it. And no, I don't mean a quick rinse of any possible chicken goop in your

07:01.020 --> 07:05.080
dirty sink. In the dirty sink, specifically, guys. You should have a clean sink in a dirty

07:05.080 --> 07:08.800
sink while cooking. What I'm talking about is, you scrub those motherfuckers with dish

07:08.800 --> 07:31.600
soap. Seriously, dish soap? What do you think you're accomplishing here? At least this

07:31.600 --> 07:36.000
guy is using vinegar, and vinegar is at least edible. Wait, no, he's also using dish soap

07:36.000 --> 07:39.680
with the vinegar. Alright, check this one out. She's really pouring it on, like the

07:39.680 --> 07:44.200
dish soap is bbq sauce or some shit. And then she's scrubbing it with the sponge, like what

07:44.200 --> 07:48.960
the fuck, why? This has to be a joke, right? This can't be real. This has to be a troll.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.800
She's scrubbing it. She's scrubbing it like I scrub a fucking dirty grease covered pan.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.400
What the fuck? Listen, I am never going to take any shit from people like this who are

07:56.400 --> 07:59.560
saying white people don't know they season and ever again, what the fuck?

07:59.560 --> 08:13.680
That's bleach, bitch. You're pouring fucking bleach in the chicken. Okay, I have to believe

08:13.680 --> 08:17.200
this is a troll. It's pretty funny if it's a troll. She's saying stuff like it won't

08:17.200 --> 08:21.720
taste right if it's not brand name bleach. Okay, you got me. Fuck, if it's not a troll

08:21.720 --> 08:25.960
though, what are you going to do next? Wash it in CLR? Jesus Christ. All I can say at

08:25.960 --> 08:30.440
this point is I'm glad we are moving towards tagging restaurants as black owned.

08:30.440 --> 08:34.200
A side conversation on all of this revolved around whether or not you should rinse your

08:34.200 --> 08:37.940
chicken, not wash with fucking soap or bleach or the blood of virgins or whatever. Just

08:37.940 --> 08:41.540
rinse off the chicken goop with water after you pull it out of the package. Some people

08:41.540 --> 08:44.560
think that the germs of the chicken are in the chicken slime and that rinsing the slime

08:44.560 --> 08:49.120
off the chicken cleans it, which is wrong. The CDC has a handy guide about why you need

08:49.120 --> 08:53.320
to cook the chicken to an internal temperature of 165 freedom degrees and how rinsing the

08:53.320 --> 08:57.100
chicken in the sink often leads to the chicken germs sticking around the sink basin where

08:57.100 --> 09:00.280
they will then go on to contaminate other dishes or food that you put into it. I'm

09:00.280 --> 09:04.720
of two minds about this because one, yes, that is absolutely true, but also I've experimented.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.960
I've both rinsed chicken and not rinsed chicken before and I've noticed differences.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.360
Keeping the packaged chicken slime on the chicken does affect the taste in a way that

09:12.360 --> 09:16.640
I personally don't like. In my experience, it also prevents spices or sauces from sticking

09:16.640 --> 09:19.840
to the meat, but you know what solves that? Adding a little bit of oil or butter. There

09:19.840 --> 09:24.080
are times when I have rinsed with water and not washed with soap, you fucking degenerates,

09:24.080 --> 09:29.040
a piece of meat before cooking it. But even when I do that, I follow the cardinal rule of cooking,

09:29.040 --> 09:34.800
maintain two sinks. Like I said before, you need a clean sink and a dirty sink to properly cook at

09:34.800 --> 09:39.900
least some dishes and you must ensure there is no crossover. But for nine times out of ten,

09:39.900 --> 09:45.160
rinsing the meat is just not necessary, guys, despite any personal taste preferences. The

09:45.160 --> 09:49.480
ultimate black pill on this topic is when you discover that a lot of cultures that developed

09:49.520 --> 09:54.640
ritualistic washing of food, as well as overspicing and overcooking, did so because due to a

09:54.640 --> 09:59.520
combination of climate and food scarcity, they tended to eat stuff that was potentially rotting

09:59.520 --> 10:03.840
due to lack of other options. And all of this stems from the fact that washing and coating

10:03.840 --> 10:07.920
your meat to the point that it's unrecognizable was a way of getting people to actually eat it.

10:07.920 --> 10:12.600
This helped lead to a belief that the only way to season meat is to cover it in dried spices,

10:12.600 --> 10:16.840
stuff that is visibly granular. And while this is obviously one way of doing it, it's amazing

10:16.840 --> 10:21.760
just how ignorant these people are. This woman is putting her chicken onto a bed of vegetables

10:21.760 --> 10:25.880
and herbs for roasting, coating it in a fresh garlic rub. And check out the replies she got.

10:25.880 --> 10:30.080
Where's the seasoning? Salt is a good start, lol. But I mean, do you use pepper, paprika,

10:30.080 --> 10:34.960
garlic or onion, salt or powder, herb seasoning, polo seasoning, anything? Do you think it's only

10:34.960 --> 10:39.440
real seasoning if you get it out of a jar? They added salt, lol, that's it. This goes all the

10:39.440 --> 10:43.760
way back to the original video where Zoe Berry explained that garlic powder comes from fucking

10:43.760 --> 10:47.960
garlic. Or we could all just be wrong about this. And instead, we're all just racists.

10:47.960 --> 10:52.920
Here's the alternative hypothesis. White people not seasoning their food actually really is based

10:52.920 --> 10:57.760
in racism and classism, lol. The reason white people don't season food is because historically,

10:57.760 --> 11:02.280
rich white people began to think seasoning was for brown people who had to season their food

11:02.280 --> 11:06.520
because they couldn't afford better tasting meat. They associated unseasoned food with cleanliness

11:06.520 --> 11:11.440
and moral purity, calling it clean or simple eating. In medieval Europe, the rich felt that

11:11.440 --> 11:15.640
once spices became affordable for everyone instead of just the wealthy, they no longer wanted them.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.720
So basically, white people don't season their food because their ancestors thought seasoning

11:19.720 --> 11:24.000
was for poor people and brown people, lol. That's right, guys. Are you a white supremacist because

11:24.000 --> 11:28.280
you don't want to eat rotten food and be shitting your guts out all night? If avoiding salmonella

11:28.280 --> 11:32.440
means that I'm part of the Third Reich, well, at least I get a cool uniform out of it. In any case,

11:32.440 --> 11:36.080
I have no idea how to end this video. Just remember that seasoning police is now a new

11:36.080 --> 11:39.080
racial slur and donate money to the subscribe star or something. Okay, bye.
