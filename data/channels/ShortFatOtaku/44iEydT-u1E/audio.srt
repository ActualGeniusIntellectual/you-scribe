00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hey everyone! Between this video today and the garden video yesterday I bet some people are asking

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,480
where's the politics content? Don't worry the politics content hasn't gone anywhere the weekly

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,040
sip is still happening tomorrow and there will be new 10 minute take politics videos and other

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
types of politics videos coming next week. The reason that I'm doing this sort of stuff is well

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,080
one I wanted to get out the garden video yesterday because frankly my grandmother is

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,280
she's she's in her 90s now and we we don't know when she's going to pass on so I would like her

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,000
to see at least some of the garden stuff she absolutely loves those garden videos I don't

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,840
want to wait until the end of summer this time to actually put one out I'd rather just do you know

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,560
a spring one and a summer one and an autumn one just in case she doesn't she doesn't last

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,280
throughout 2022. I know that sounds harsh but you mean you you know what I mean but as for this

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,040
video if you go into the backlog of this channel I'm talking way back way before SFO was ever about

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,720
politics this is pre-gamergate stuff you'll find at least a few videos I think are still online

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:08,480
of me and Dave doing a series called trailer talk and I think we talked about uh man of steel back

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,240
when that was a new movie we talked about star trek into darkness I think we did one about the

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,000
hobbit you know this is all you know stuff that was nine or ten years ago and all of those trailer

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
talks were basically recorded as soon as possible right when we left the theater so we could

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
actually give like an honest opinion of it we always kind of envisioned a trailer talk to be

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,600
the kind of thing where we go to explicitly a very late night screening maybe even like a midnight

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,440
show of a movie and then in the darkness of the parking lot or in one case in the darkness of our

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,480
backyard we talked about the movie in the middle of the night and it was supposed to be kind of

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,000
this quiet private intimate little discussion about movies and the main reason we kind of let

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,480
that series die around 2014 is because none of us had a car anymore to go to the movie theater

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,720
but now that we have a car and now that covid is no more I do want to revive the trailer talk series

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm not going to revive it on SFO this is still a politics channel I'm uploading the first new one

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,080
right here just to let you know and any future trailer talks are going to appear over on the

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,120
dev kit channel the dev kit channel is basically my personal channel where I do tech stuff I do

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,280
unboxings I do reviews I do trailer talks now basically anything that's not politics and that

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,560
isn't part of the game boomers you know let's play thing I'm gonna put up on dev kit it is a channel

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,360
that is mainly my personal channel and not necessarily you know SFO the brand but nonetheless

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,520
I would still appreciate it if you decided to follow it and keep up with what I'm doing there

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,920
because I know that Naomi likes going to movies so whenever we go to a movie maybe we'll shoot

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,760
a trailer talk who knows but anyway I'm putting the first one up here just to let you know hope

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,400
you enjoy it and if you want to see any more please head over to dev kit thank you very much

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
guys new politics content coming after this I really appreciate you sticking around I'll see

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,120
you next time I love you so we're back at this it's been about 10 years since we've actually done

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:07,760
this this show on the channel 10 years years so for those of you who have been watching long

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,400
before the politics stuff long before gamergate Dave and I did a show on this channel we have

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,760
a half a dozen episodes or so called trailer talk but what we would do is you would go see

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,120
a really late screening of a movie yeah really late and then it's like past past midnight right

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,920
now yes yeah and then talk about it like basically the night of I forgot I already had some water

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,280
here I'm so I had so much popcorn dude I'm gonna float away why why would you float away because I

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:46,160
feel bloated but wouldn't you just sink instead of floating maybe but anyway we want today

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,040
tonight we went out to the old cinema and now it's like 1am or whatever and we had we watched

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,480
sonic the hedgehog 2 2 second one okay what the fuck's happening with this thing oh for the love

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:07,840
of god I will open it will you yeah let's see will you yep yeah yep keep talking hold on I

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
want to see this first free time before we talk about any fucking movie I want to see this shit

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,960
will you open it maybe not this is more than the fucking movie was

48
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,120
oh the movie wasn't that bad no it wasn't actually but this is for some reason I'm not opening

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:33,440
well anyway so we saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2 now we also watched Sonic the Hedgehog 1 that came out

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,080
like during the pandemic didn't it I don't remember that was eons ago was it it was the

51
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,160
reason we're doing it the night of is because I'll forget yeah I'll forget all my opinions

52
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,080
my tomorrow even though technically it is tomorrow we watched Sonic 1 and how did we both feel about

53
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,400
Sonic 1 we both liked Sonic 1 but it was very obviously a kids movie well yeah and so was this

54
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,080
one well yeah but like like I mean like you can't go into it expecting it to be like like a good

55
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,280
kids movie you know what I mean why not well no no okay no no I mean like a good drink good well

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,760
you explained this a good kids movie for adults you know like yes there's references to the actual

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,840
Sonic games and the movie but you have to expect going in that yes it's very simplified like there's

58
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,160
lots of funny goofy moments there's no swearing as it's for children specifically it's not for

59
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,760
like teenagers kind of edging on the adults so adults can kind of enjoy it too no it's for kids

60
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,880
yes definitely for children but this look good but you have to make sure that you know that

61
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,760
they're for kids going into it yeah so the first Sonic was

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,200
possible

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,840
this is all staying in the family no have the water have the water I'm gonna okay so the first

64
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Sonic um Sonic likes to do this thing whenever they do like a like a I wouldn't say movie but

65
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:09,680
a show or anything else what Sonic likes to do is they like to um basically throw in human characters

66
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,320
and they always do like a Sonic comes to the human world situation happens it was Sonic X

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,800
they did it with I think one of the comics they did it with a lot of Sonic properties

68
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,960
because like the actual story of Sonic is Sonic lives in a world where at least the original

69
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,760
Sonics like we're talking like Sonic one two and three and Sonic and Knuckles and um there's there

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:41,760
was a bunch of situations where basically Sonic was fighting Robotnik and there's not much story

71
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,600
to it and there's animal friends and there's there's magic and like Robotnik being the only

72
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,200
human doesn't make any sense but you know what fuck it's it's a video game you know it was made

73
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,520
it was made back in the 90s okay listen no no didn't you say that a premise to the Sonic game

74
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
specifically was that they were all mutated animals that was later they added that to try

75
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,120
and explain the original oh wait okay so since since they were trying to explain the original

76
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
obviously Robotnik was the only human survivor because he was the only one smart enough to

77
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
survive he wasn't it was actually a lot of humans just we don't see them until Sonic Adventure but

78
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,960
yeah never mind basically like the idea from what I understand the whole Mobius which was the planet

79
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,840
that they were all on was actually a far future earth where you have nuclear war and mutated

80
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
animals and they're still humans that's why in Sonic Adventure there's like a city with humans

81
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
and like a station square there's still a bunch of humans hanging around but there's also animals

82
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,160
too and people are just okay with it because they've gotten used to it and the level of

83
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
technology is like equivalent to like 90s earth because they've gotten back to that point but

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,600
there's just a bunch of furries running around and so that was like the small furries that was

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,440
the deep lore but of course they do for example in Sonic X it was that there was like an alternate

86
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,640
universe there's always alternate universes there's a sonic universe and then there's the

87
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,320
and there's like the human universe and there's always like Sonic gets iskaid over into the human

88
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,960
universe and that's like it's iskaid I thought it was isekaid what a wrong fucking guy

89
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,160
and that is what Sonic 1 ended up being it ended up being exactly what if you were going to do what

90
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,720
every other time you've done Sonic yes they they they did a thing where you know he goes to the

91
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,920
United States he goes to Green Hill the town called Green Hills and like is it Montana I don't

92
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,240
know in the middle middle of trees in the middle of trees that's where it was yep for the rich

93
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,960
people hosts yeah was there any reason for that opening bit in Sonic 2 to be set in Seattle I

94
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,480
don't think so never came back to being in Seattle well no it was to set up the fact that Sonic still

95
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,920
wanted to be a hero but why Seattle like the first movie why Seattle probably because it was semi

96
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,760
close by okay maybe well or he heard that the crime was happening right that second in this

97
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,880
iteration of the story Sonic is from another planet there's rings that the actual rings in

98
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,080
the games they're they're basically teleportation devices you can open portals to go wherever you

99
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
want to go they don't really explain it too hard because they're just having a good time

100
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,160
and what ends up happening is Sonic he escaped he's on a planet with an owl mother which is like

101
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,000
a new creation of this game and the Enkidna tribe is coming to kick the shit out of her to try and

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
get the master mode you'll find out about the first movie but in the first movie he goes to

103
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,800
he escapes he goes to earth he's raised by himself himself for a bit and then eventually

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,080
this dude who finds him what was his name again he's so forgettable tom tom he's so forgettable

105
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,360
he doesn't tom tom chowski whichowski or something he he had more of a thing he had more of a part in

106
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:43,680
the first movie oh yeah no like okay tom guy tom guy he was in the second movie I don't remember

107
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,600
that he was in the second movie and we're just watching okay real quickly first movie he ends

108
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,440
up with tom robotnik is a defense contractor with the us government initially he's making drones and

109
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,800
stuff he's doing his thing um and he ends up he the government wants him to fight sonic because

110
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,760
he's an alien yes something like that but then he also ends he ends up taking the loss personally

111
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,480
and so they had like this giant fight throughout the first movie they fight in san francisco well

112
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,680
i'm just quickly getting through okay okay fine go and then by the end by the end of it um sonic

113
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,720
tricks robotnik into going through a ring yeah and he ends up on a mushroom planet there's literally

114
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,960
nothing about mushrooms it's only mushrooms mushrooms and rock yeah and there's there's a lot

115
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,000
of uh really fun references in both movies actually the second movie had uh uh the um

116
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,640
it's a coffee place called the mean bean which is obviously a reference to dr robotnik's mean

117
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,720
bean machine i don't know what that is but i don't know but nail me are you fucking kidding

118
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:51,520
the references okay but anyway yeah we're references yes but anyway anyway the point being

119
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,280
is that uh that's the first movie the first movie was actually it was a pretty solid kids movie

120
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,760
it was a bit cringy at times but it was still as all kids as all kids movies yes like you could do

121
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,160
a lot worse with a kid's movie yeah it wasn't stupid no it wasn't um it was a bit too self-referential

122
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,600
it's always this one they both like had too many like breaking jokes

123
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,560
just that like the time when they're going down the um the uh the mountain and sonic

124
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,160
calls knuckles the winter soldier i was like like i i i i get the fourth wall breaking stuff but

125
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,800
you can't do too much of it and sonic always did too much of it always um too much for me but

126
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:39,200
anyway second movie okay it opened with we opened with um robotnik making mushroom coffee after

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,800
having been on the planet for a year trying to rebuild he has like a broken spaceship right

128
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,480
yeah he got sent through with the broken machine it's a mech i think it's a mech something i don't

129
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,880
even remember i think no the fight from during the fight in the first movie oh my god it doesn't

130
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,520
matter he had a mech and the mech went through with him yes whatever the fuck he had in the final

131
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,600
act of the first movie with with him anyway he's using the the parts from that to build a giant

132
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,680
antenna to signal space to see who the fuck comes to the mushroom planet yet he had nothing else

133
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,680
he's like i'm just gonna signal and he had like one of sonic's quills which had the like the sonic

134
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,640
power which was he helped him use the energy from the quill to power the the yeah but basically it's

135
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,720
um eggman robot they use both the robot again yeah they use both yeah but he basically he fires

136
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,840
off this this laser and he's hoping someone shows up yeah and knuckle shows up well you have three

137
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,920
randoms who are never explained show up yeah i don't know who the fuck those guys are they're

138
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,000
they look like humans yeah they look like humans with like bird masks yeah but then then robotnik

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,760
more or less kills them yeah yeah not graphically he more or less murders them with just traps

140
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,960
goofy traps yeah and then knuckles comes through and he's like oh and then knuckles is just like

141
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,160
he sees the quill and it's just like oh where did you get that and a black man deep black man voice

142
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,640
i can't do i think it is interest elva who's doing this i don't know i can't do that voice i am not a

163
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,000
he like he fucks everything up and he like a bunch of people get hurt but no no no no one got hurt

164
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,520
but he almost killed many people no one can get hurt as a pg movie yeah many people almost got

170
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,600
trying to pretend that he's um he was like asleep all night yep he's doing the bruce wayne thing

171
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,160

172
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,840
don't be reckless don't be reckless because you're still a kid and yeah sonic's at 16.

173
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:51,120
sonic was always a kid yeah as long as a kid so he's ariel's age so sonic's a kid who little

174
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,760
mermaid fuck you who wanted to go off into her own thing which was 14 i'm pretty sure

175
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:02,560
i'm pretty sure in the disney movie she's 16 okay well anyway anyway anyway um

176
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,600
so that whole thing happens and then they they're going off to uh tom and his wife they're going

177
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,560
off to hawaii for a destination wedding and sonic is like i'll just send you there with one of my

178
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,120
teleportation rings and they go and then like sonic's at home and he has he does he destroys

179
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,080
the house yeah he doesn't he destroys the house he does the thing that like every teenager generally

180
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,680
does when they're left alone for the first time is they just fucking party and sonic just fucking

181
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,400
party by himself he partied by himself yeah well i mean fuck he doesn't like he's an alien like

182
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,960
no no i know but like it was actually with a dog he partnered with the dog but you know what's

183
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,640
weird though is that i feel like that was supposed to be like that pitbull yeah the guy who has no

184
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,560
like friends moments but it wasn't sonic was just having a really good fucking time fucking like he

185
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,840
trashes the house with a bunch of food and then he drives the riding lawnmower through the through

186
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,600
the house to like mulch the food up and spread it across the that was hilarious that was so gross

187
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,240
like imagine just like 18 bags of chips ripped open on the ground and then just like

188
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,040
just drive right through everywhere but anyway to skip over the rest of that and he makes like a

189
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,280
foam room with a pool but anyway and then and then he cleans it up all cleans it all up in like 30

190
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,120
seconds when tom calls from hawaii because he can do that because he facetimes because facetime is

191
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,080
a thing so now you actually have to clean up the room before you answer the phone yeah yes um but

192
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,040
anyway what ends up happening is robotnik comes back yeah robotnik shows up with knuckles and

193
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,280
beats the fuck out of sonic yeah knuckles kicks the shit out of sonic and he's fucking done and

194
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,440
then there's tails tails tails never really explained tails does not explain he they give

195
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
him like a couple lines where they explain a little bit but he basically shows up the couple

196
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,400
of lines were hey uh you gave up a shit ton of energy and it got to my home planet and i've been

197
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,800
stalking you you're really cool and i love you and i've been stalking you yeah that's the most

198
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,240
strange this is strange um and sonic isn't even a face he's like you even watched me in the shower

199
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,280
and tails is like that's a trick question sonic prefers bubble baths and sonic isn't phased at all

200
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,840
it's weird okay with it that was weird yeah it was weird it was a weird moment and it's never

201
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,520
dressed ever again but like like tails mentions his village once but like we don't get to know

202
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,160
anything about tails you don't know why you don't really why you showed up it's just like i like you

203
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,960
sonic is like okay i guess no he came to warn sonic about knuckles yes he did but like but

204
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,040
you can't say there's no reason for him okay but it's a shitty reason because yes but it's still a

205
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,600
reason like it's shitty it's not there tails is in the movie because they put tails because they put

206
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,320
tails in the script and no no it's because they put tails in the after credit sequence in the

207
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,560
first movie oh that's why tails is in the movie well yes they had to put them in somehow yeah

208
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,320
and they weren't and here's the thing like sonic one is i think just sonic sonic two like the games

209
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,760
sonic two is sonic and tails versus robotnik and then sonic three they're like how about we try a

210
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,240
story and so they add the floating island and the master emerald and they add um and they add

211
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,920
knuckles who's the guardian and then um robotnik like tricks knuckles and it's the same story in

212
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,880
the movie and then eventually um you get to the point where robotnik flies in and that goes to

213
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
steal the master emerald and then knuckles is like oh my god sonic you actually weren't evil

214
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,600
and then knuckles like uh sorry uh robotnik tasers him he tasers uh knuckles oh and then there's like

215
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,080
a big fight with all of them at the end against against um robotnik so so they are basically

216
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,400
they're doing the sonic three story they haven't introduced tails because tails is part of sonic

217
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,360
two so tails just shows up and he's like i've been stalking you let me be your pal and sonic's like

218
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:43,040
okay and then so they're on they bond in russia yeah it's like it's a kid's movie so they're just

219
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,240
gonna be like okay fine but like yeah it wasn't really set up it was not but anyway so now uh

220
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,480
tails shows up tails rescues him they go on like a little chase they get away not much of a chase

221
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,920
how much of a chase but they get away it's pretty it's pretty much tail shows up hit snuggles with

222
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:05,680
a car and they escape yep then they go to uh tom's friend's place wade yeah wade it's like his

223
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,920
garage i hate him and like yeah he was just there for like a minute because he was from the first

224
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,240
movie but he was just there for a minute and then he was like he's the deputy he's the deputy sheriff

225
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,160
yeah the town he's an idiot but they go to his place because he was in the first movie he knows

226
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,240
he knows what sonic so he goes there and then sonic's like yeah so in the first movie i got

227
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,640
this map and the map is it turns out the map's the map to the master emerald oh and the master

228
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,320
was hidden on earth yeah and it turns out that for just you know sonic touches the map i guess

229
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,920
for the first time for the first time ever even because as soon as he touches it a big hologram

230
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,520
comes out i was gonna point this out of the owl girl you know listen i was gonna point this out

231
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,520
in the theater but i'm pretty sure we literally saw him touch the map earlier in the movie you

232
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,800
think so i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure he actually opened it up and looked at it in the

233
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,360
earlier part of the movie maybe it's because he touched the part that said master emerald on it

234
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,560
maybe but anyway a coincidence a hologram shows up a hologram shows up of the of the owl of the

235
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,360
owl mom sonic's owl mom and it's like listen listen sonic so if you're reading this if you

236
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,200
if you're hearing this i'm dead master emerald's hidden on earth you gotta go find it find it

237
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,560
there's here's your quest yeah onward and so it's like oh my god this i can finally be a hero

238
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,320
and then so they and wade's like i guess i'm here like wade fucking does nothing

239
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,440
wait wait was annoying that scene would have been better without him yeah but anyway then they go

240
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,600
to russia yeah so they use it turns out that like the coordinates on the map lead to russia russia

241
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,840
and so they go to russia and there's like there's an there's an interlude where they have a dance

242
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,600
off with a bunch of russians they have a dance up like a like a like a dive russian a bar that's

243
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,160
in a really nice building but it's like a dive bar in russia it's in the middle of a snowstorm

244
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,520
in the middle of a snowstorm in the middle of the mountains yeah it's just a dive bar

245
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,840
and there's a dance off because they somehow get a hold of the map they're just through

246
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,640
through shenanigans yeah and they dance us for it and it's like okay so they have a dance off

247
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,600
to summarize it's tales and sonic's bonding moment yeah for the movie it's the bonding moment it's

248
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,600
the bonding moment yeah so they dance they dance off and they get they get the map back but like

249
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,200
there's there's not much to it like it's kind of goofy like they dance yeah because it's a

250
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,920
kids movie you can kind of forgive the fact they go on wild tangents sometimes because uh this

251
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,840
would be not be acceptable in adults but what the fuck is this like yeah it's funny at least it's

252
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,320
funny it's still it's still a fine kids movie um get the map they find a temple in an ice

253
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,520
in the mountains we're assuming in the side of a mountain somewhere they didn't actually show us

254
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,360
how they got into it suddenly they were in the mountain range with the paramount symbol

255
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,720
actually the mount was like the paramount was actually pretty funny and then they're suddenly

256
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,120
in the temple so we're assuming it's in the side of the mountain somewhere so so tails flies holding

257
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,200
sonic you know and in the usual sonic 2 way where he has like his arms they fly into a hole in the

258
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,800
side of a mountain yeah i think i missed that but they fly into a hole in the side of like a big ice

259
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,440
like glacier in a mountain they go in and then okay well i'm still right and they land and then

260
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,040
there's a giant owl door and they're like oh i guess humans never discovered this place before

261
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,400
even though it's like in the russian mountains it's fine well maybe because it's in the Russian

262
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,000
everyone just dies up there okay yeah yeah it's Russia yeah so they go in there um they poke

263
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,560
around the temple they do like the new traps and and puzzles and then Sonic when she finds a compass

264
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,880
and the compass the compass points to the location of the emerald and it's like okay well now we're

265
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,400
one step closer then um yeah then Knuckles and Robotnik catch up and they show they have another

266
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,680
fight everyone gets beaten up everyone gets beaten up but then Sonic decides to escape by using a um

267
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,360
a piece of a mech as a snowboard because he's done that several times in the games so they're

268
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,760
snowboarding down and then Knuckles also does the same thing there's a wave flying in the sky

269
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,160
yeah and snow and Sonic is snowboarding down the mountain while all Robotnik's robots are like

270
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,400
exploding the mountain like beside and behind him there's lots of explosions yeah and then

271
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Knuckles comes and beats him up and then Tails also gets beaten up and Tails becomes unconscious

272
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,120
because he gets hit with rockets yes and then it turns out that um and then both Robotnik and

273
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,400
Knuckles escape with the compass yeah they get away okay hold on I want to tell this part okay

274
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,520
so there's a bit at this point where Sonic's this is like this is the second act of the story

275
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,080
yeah where like Sonic is down and out I want to point out this does not feel like the second act

276
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,480
of the story but it is but it is yeah Sonic's down and out Robotnik and Knuckles are now ahead

277
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,720
in the race to find the master emerald they have the compass and a giant and a giant uh a snow

278
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,200
avalanche a giant giant snowstorm on the mountain a giant avalanche is coming towards

279
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,880
Sonic and the unconscious Tails yeah so Sonic's carrying Tails like this and snowboarding again

280
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,680
yeah and so we're both pretty sure he lost the snowboard he found another one it's fine and

281
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,400
he's like I gotta get the fuck out of here somehow yeah because he lost all of his teleport rings yes

282
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,720
so he calls up Tom Tom who's at who's at Hawaii who's in Hawaii and here's the thing

283
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,400
Tom has one teleport ring to get back from from the trip yeah but he accidentally due to his

284
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:14,000
shenanigans he mixes it up with the wedding ring yep yeah so Tom is like Sonic calls him

285
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
and he's like Sonic's like listen you gotta get I'm gonna fucking die in the middle of the wedding

286
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,640
ceremony yeah and Tom's okay I'll do it and then Tom pulls out the wedding ring and tries to use

287
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,960
it to teleport and doesn't work because it's a wedding ring he's like oh fuck dude so he goes

288
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,240
he runs up to the podium because he got mixed yeah he punches the groom in the face no that's

289
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,240
not right away this is after a bit of back and forth tries to yes this is can I tell this

290
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,400
he punches the groom in the face and then he like he gets the ring and then he throws it

291
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,160
immediately like in front like in front of the wedding of the wedding yeah so the portal opens

292
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,680
up and the entire avalanche comes into the wedding and destroys the wedding not like these

293
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,120
not the entire avalanche enough of the avalanche to destroy the wedding like that was absolutely

294
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,360
fucking hilarious yeah there's some very clever very funny things that happened yeah yeah it was

295
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,320
pretty good yeah it was good but we were both screaming at Tom because we were alone in the

296
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,840
theater because it's such a late movie this kid's movie right there's no one there was dude it was

297
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,200
just us there was no one there it was just you and I and I was like is this even profitable for

298
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,440
these guys that's what they make the money off the popcorn oh yeah we had popcorn fuck

299
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,000
dude popcorn's expensive popcorn's expensive popcorn was always expensive holy shit dude

300
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,200
there's a cab showing up I guess someone else's we just got out yep all right so yeah um once

301
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,040
they get there uh the u.s government it turns out the wedding was actually a sham it was a catfish

302
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,920
operation it was called operation catfish and the the bride's um husband was actually secret agent

303
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,680
and the priest was secret agent and everyone's secret agent everyone was a secret agent and

304
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:59,840
they're all at the woman it's a woman yeah it's a misogynistic movie guys and they're all working

305
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,040
for gun now name we didn't care no i don't know gun is the guardian unit of nations from sonic

306
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,240
adventure 2 they're the ones that that that did like the whole uh space the space colony

307
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,360
arc and project shadow from sonic adventure 2 like they they have a big place in sonic lore

308
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
and so but they made fun of the name immediately like did you call yourself gun really i get

309
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,400
freaking he's like yeah why not but basically uh gun shows up kidnaps sonic entails and also

310
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,320
tom because tom tries to fight them like an idiot tom punches more people in the face because that's

311
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,920
the only thing he's really doing in this movie fucking up and punching people in the face

312
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,600
there's a bit of like a there's like a half action sequence trying to rescue them there's not much

313
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,400
of a one no no no the the action sequence is the two women who were part of the wedding party who

314
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,880
should have been incarcerated with everyone like with the men yeah they just get left to their own

315
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
devices so they have tails's technology and they use it to rescue them like by beating up all the

316
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,960
guards yeah they have tails in the backpack here's the thing it's because he i keep saying this they

317
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,240
didn't punch the gun members the way that tom did so they didn't get arrested the guy literally

318
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,160
said this is the last time you're gonna be uh hiding in a bedding an alien you know and then

319
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,000
only takes tom away i don't remember the wife's name you say bedding an alien i don't it's a

320
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,280
bedding not bedding i said a bedding no i i said a bedding i said it with a d oh bedding yeah

321
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,840
okay so anyway there's like a half action sequence that doesn't really go anywhere that where they

322
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,720
rescue they rescue everyone stupid they subdue them misogynistic it was a misogynist it was it

323
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:47,120
was why wasn't she incarcerated too because i'm just a girl anyway moving on stop thumping the

324
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:54,720
car you're making the camera move okay actually stop okay you know so what ends up happening

325
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,880
is sonic they're on they're on the shore of hawaii and they see a giant green beam off in the

326
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,520
distance and that's because on a neighboring island the the compass has taken eggman and

327
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,600
knuckles to the location of the master emerald yep and so they put the thing on and there's

328
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,000
a little like a little daze on the beach and they put it in and then like does this giant

329
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,120
uh moses thing where like the sea parts and there's a giant underwater temple yep because

330
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,680
it's under the sea yeah yeah under the sea it's like sure that would have been discovered before

331
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,160
but fine whatever so it's fine they you know what's funny though is that it wasn't even that

332
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:35,440
far under no it was like 10 feet under yeah it doesn't open that much yeah so the you know um

333
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,560
sonic is like i gotta fucking go over there she goes over there um almost dies almost has no way

334
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,080
but you guys over there and there's like a big sequence under in the temple where there's like

335
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,400
traps and goofiness yes but i i'm still indiana jones for kids i'm complaining because the temple

336
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,400
was dusty and there was roots yep from from plants from plants but it was underwater it was

337
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,480
underwater you know what's actually funny is that there was also plants i think you missed some of

338
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,960
there was also plants in the tunnel in the temple yeah in the tunnel yeah it's like okay but yeah

339
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,280
you know they're they're doing their thing they know their tropes okay fine um and then they get

340
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,440
to the the chamber of the master emerald yep and then sonic comes crashing through the roof

341
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,480
yeah accidentally he's like yeah the chamber somehow there's another sonic and knuckles fight

342
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,840
yep uh which gets interrupted by eggman seeing the emerald because he always was going to

343
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,800
sonic almost dies again yep but sonic rescues knuckles this time knuckles is sad because it

344
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,040
turns out eggman wasn't really his friend yeah they decided to all go and take on um

345
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:39,120
eggman together yep eggman um he returns to green hills yeah well after letting the emerald like

346
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,160
consume him oh yeah he comes not a different person but he becomes green instead of red

347
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,840
yeah he has like green like lightning bolt powers he's flying around like a god yeah he's doing like

348
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:55,520
a very god-like things yeah um so god eggman i guess we'll call him i don't know god eggman

349
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,240
works god eggman this is usually where you step in and call him a demigod he always correct me

350
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,600
on those it's god eggman yeah whenever i say he's a god right like oh he's a demigod he said about

351
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,760
sephiroth he said about the dragon spirits and skyward sword what else he said about like he's

352
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,840
a demigod not a god no because okay you know what never mind we'll have this discussion later

353
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,000
my fucking brain is dead from how loud the theater was

354
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
our theater's always been this loud i don't know but like when i'm fucking loud when i

355
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:30,160
myself like a little bit like a week two weeks ago yeah like it was loud like it was just like

356
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:37,680
in my movie it was quieter it was still really loud yeah so oh by the way just don't go see the

357
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,560
northman it's not that great you want to do a trailer talk in the northman no it's it's not

358
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:50,960
that great don't go see it okay so what ends up happening guys is they decide to go fight him

359
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,120
together and so tails like this all happens off screen but i think this is what happened

360
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,600
he steals the biplane that was used to fly through the wedding to like to like

361
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:08,400
rachel slash fiance's name for the number four forever yeah so tails takes the biplane upgrades

362
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,480
it with guns because it's tails and yet he has to he somehow had time to do that he has to have

363
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:20,080
a biplane yes it's tails it's tails always has a biplane yeah so and then they fly from hawaii

364
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,960
back to what the green hills with a biplane with with the ring that they somehow acquired

365
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,120
did they use the ring they used the ring they used the ring that they somehow acquired even though

366
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,640
son had lost all of this i think knuckles picked them up knuckles picked up all the rings i think

367
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,040
so i don't know because they fell off the cliff no no remember knuckles used a ring to get him

368
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,520
an eggman to the island maybe knuckles picked up his rings like who knows but anyway they have

369
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,200
some rings again whatever they they get back to green hills um and at that point eggman had

370
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,680
returned to green hills because his his uh backup base was that was the mean bean yeah coffee place

371
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,760
yeah and his his henchman is there just like playing playing a bunch of like just doing stuff

372
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,080
and eggman shows up he has like he has no technology anymore because all of his all of

373
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,440
his drones are fucked yeah but then he starts using the powers of the master emerald just to

374
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,360
suck in all the metal in the area so like trains and cars and tanks and stuff this is also yes the

375
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,960
the his base being surrounded by the government yep so he sucks everything all the metal in the

376
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,560
town in into one location yeah and he build and he uses the powers to build a giant mech yeah

377
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,680
and he starts fucking up the town with a giant mech and it's great and then uh sonic tails and

378
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:39,520
knuckles fly in it on the on the biplane they have their big giant fight it's a this big extended

379
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:47,440
action sequence um and then it turns out that the master emerald shatters after i think like

380
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,640
knuckles okay okay yeah knuckles punch okay after you know the the huge fight they all they all they

381
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,000
all get defeated by the mech and then you know they all group together and be like we have to

382
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,640
fight him together as a team and then they do and then knuckles punters after sonic distracts

383
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,800
eggman knuckles punches the emerald out of eggman's chest not in a bloody way just

384
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,120
to the chest and emerald comes out the back and then so the mech falls the emerald falls sonic

385
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,720
ends up dragging his half dead body over to it making this a lot more graphic than it actually

386
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,680
so but here's the thing the emerald shatters the emerald the master emerald breaks yes and inside

387
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,440
the master emerald are the seven chaos emeralds yes and i'm just like you have a huge grape

388
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,280
wood i do because the seven chaos emeralds are a different thing than the goddamn master emerald

389
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,720
they are different things but in this movie they're the same thing so the master emerald

390
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,760
breaks it turns out the seven chaos emeralds on the side of it it turns out sonic we already knew

391
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,880
the seven chaos technically inside yeah they mentioned it very early on yeah they got they

392
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,880
got a throwaway line about it yeah um and i was like what the fuck um but then sonic uses the

393
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,000
the the stop shaking the goddamn car jesus sonic uses the um master emerald sorry the chaos emerald

394
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,760
to become supersonic he destroys eggman's mech um eggman somehow gets away of course he does he

395
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,000
didn't they couldn't find his body in the big collapse no no you forgot the most important

396
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
part sonic becomes ultimate sonic i said that supersonic oh yeah i didn't hear it you said

397
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,520
ultimate in the theater so i assumed that's what the name was he he uses these i didn't say

398
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,320
he uses the seven chaos emeralds to become supersonic which is the just a super saiyan

399
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,720
super saiyan it's like dragon ball super saiyan but yeah you know what the fuck it is okay so

400
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,400
um everyone but me and then when the power runs out the emeralds scatter because they're

401
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,360
basically dragon balls they scatter um and then they're like well i guess we'll just all live in

402
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,360
green hills now and they do and then actually this is after knuckles somehow fixes the master

403
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,760
emerald with his hands oh he could do that in the games too that's actually fine he just goes

404
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,440
and then it's fine yeah yep and the math but here's the thing he fixes the master emerald

405
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,400
without having seven chaos emeralds in it so it still has some power but it's not the same thing

406
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,760
like i don't know yeah so in in the original continuity um the master emerald kept the

407
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,160
floating island floating yeah and it could also be used to regulate the powers of the seven chaos

408
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,240
emeralds but it was never required to have the master emerald to to become supersonic or to

409
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,440
become no i'm hyper knuckles or any other super forms um jesus christ i fucking remember all this

410
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,880
shit i remember all this shit when i was a kid okay anyway the end of the movie they all live

411
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,480
happily ever after in green hills till the next movie yeah and um including like like tails

412
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,160
knuckles just move in with them i guess they're just all hanging out now they're all kids now oh

413
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,960
and the pivotal emotional moment is when sonic calls tom dad yeah you're my dad and he's like

414
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,160
my son's a freak my son's a fucking alien no it is this is clark kent superman shit this is an

415
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,880
him and his wife are totally fine with it i don't even remember the wife's name

416
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,440
i don't actually think they imagine i'm just surprised that she's black why um because you

417
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,160
don't usually see a white guy with a black girl in like in hollywood yeah but they're trying to

418
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,000
change that now because wokeness yeah which is i i you know what i mean i guess yes okay

419
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,960
non-white guys with white girls that's wokeness white guys with non-white girls that's just based

420
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,440
i'm trolling i'm trolling i swear to god yeah so anyway anyway um the the post credit sequence

421
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,440
is is are the gun guys cleaning up the eggman mess yep and they discover there's a a secret

422
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:39,600
black site research facility where for 50 years they've been building shadow shadow with a quick

423
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,200
cameo from dr eggman's assistant so we know that dr eggman's definitely alive yeah definitely yeah

424
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,200
um and and here's the thing i said this to you in the in the theater um the story of sonic

425
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,920
adventure 2 which is the shadow story is predicated on sonic adventure 1 yeah because

426
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,560
sonic adventure 1 was was the story of the ancient echidnas and how they had this they fought this um

427
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,320
this primordial this primordial god inside the master emerald called i think it's called chaos

428
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,080
he's like he's like a blue goo man and when he absorbs when he absorbs um emeralds he becomes

429
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,040
stronger and then by the end of the game um there's a giant chaos monster destroying the city

430
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,800
and like millions are dead because it's like flooded and there's like it's fucking awful

431
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,560
and you play super sonic and you and you defeat them i think they just switched it for the owls

432
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,120
yeah but this like if they had actually made sonic adventure the movie that would have been

433
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,640
fucking amazing probably because that game was actually really good it was like it's probably

434
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,280
the best sonic game i think um and then sonic adventure 2 is a direct sequel where the idea

435
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:51,440
is that robotnik's grandfather was in charge of a satellite um a a space colony called called

436
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,680
space colony arc and they were they were using the knowledge of chaos that the echidnas had

437
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,840
to like they were making like false chaoses to use them as like like weapons um and they but

438
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:09,760
also at the same time uh they were i think were they trying to clone sonic but basically they

439
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,920
they ended up making shadow as as an experiment with with the emeralds and shadow is just as fast

440
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,080
as sonic he is he's basically what knuckles should have been like you know the coil he's he's just

441
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,640
emo sonic and everyone loves him yes and then he also like falls in love with a human woman

442
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:37,120
no what happens is um princess nope okay nope so what happens is um this is a robotnik's grandfather

443
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,160
was running the whole project yeah and she he had a daughter and this daughter was growing up

444
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,920
on the space station and she and shadow were friends yep but when they shut the project down

445
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,560
because the chaos creatures went out of control um gun basically went up there and purged everyone

446
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,920
and killed everyone yeah and shadow she like shadow uh was locked away by her i think and so

447
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,280
he was put into a tube for 50 years and she got like all she riddled up with bullets she was

448
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,160
fucking destroyed she was just shot shot the fuck up it was kind of a tragic scene actually um and

449
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
then shadow's like you know what i'm just gonna kill all of humanity fuck all of you look what you

450
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,920
fuck you you killed my only friend fuck you that's getting a good villain origin story i'm okay with

451
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:22,160
that yeah and and what ends up happening is like um in sonic adventure 2 robotnik like turns good

452
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,800
because he's like maybe we should maybe you know okay i mean my grandfather was kind of terrible

453
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,920
because my grandfather after like the grandfather after seeing his daughter died he like he's he

454
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,440
set up a whole bunch of shit that went down 50 years later to try and destroy the world

455
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,840
and robotics like maybe i should stop this so he like helps out robotnik turns good finally

456
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,440
which is not that common in the series actually but he turned good this time oh that's gonna be

457
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,560
weird for them to do that because robotic is like really evil he's really evil he's like he's

458
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,760
significantly more evil than the games like he he's not just like yeah i like was kind of like

459
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,880
uh this not a shitty scientist but i was a misunderstood scientist and now i'm just also

460
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,200
a mad scientist no like he's he's a mad scientist he's he's he's he's chaotic evil

461
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,560
he's actually he's still very funny though he's really goofy like jim carrey does a really good

462
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,640
job yeah i like it a lot he did a great job in the first we did a great job in this movie it's

463
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,240
funny it's really funny when i heard that jim carrey was going to be dr robonic i don't know

464
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,960
that that like to be fair i don't know that much about sonic but from like the little bit i do know

465
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,320
i was like that's gonna be fucking awful like it was actually really good he did such a good job

466
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,000
also because like robotics fat and he's not fat but it's like whatever yeah it doesn't matter

467
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,520
too much yeah it kind of matters but not really like it here's the thing here's the thing they're

468
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,640
still using all like the imagery and everything yeah and and and the thing is if he had done a

469
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,120
bad job i probably matter about the not fat thing but he did such a good job it is such a good job

470
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,440
so there's there's like um there's there's probably the funniest line i think is when

471
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,240
like he's flying around like a god inside of the mech and his assistant who's in like a pilot seat

472
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,360
or like the co-pilot seat is like sir you're magnificent and he's like thank you sycophant

473
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:11,600
yeah your admiration was inevitable and i was like yes like he just renames his lackey there

474
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:17,040
yeah to like like he has like all these different names for him you just they're all insulting yeah

475
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,280
and we're pretty sure that the lackey's in love with him but we're not entirely sure

476
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,320
yeah like there's there's a there's a lot of one-way homoeroticism coming from the lackey

477
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,000
towards robotnik yeah and robotic doesn't even care he like he doesn't like abuse him or anything

478
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,480
necessarily but he's like he doesn't even notice that it's happening yeah he doesn't even know

479
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,080
he's a giant fucking narcissist like yeah of course people love him i love me everyone loves me

480
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,160
yeah if you don't i'll just kill you

481
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,960
yeah so it it turns out that they're going to be doing for for the third movie they're going to do

482
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,960
shadow story shadow story from sonic adventure 2 which i think is not gonna work out unless they

483
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,200
somehow do sonic adventure 1 at the same time because this movie kind of did do sonic 2 and 3

484
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,920
and knuckles all at the same time yeah so maybe they could do like they could do like the first

485
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,880
act of the movie is them going to be explaining maybe sonic adventures and then they're going to

486
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,480
move on maybe i don't know because that's how we know that's how it's going to work because they

487
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,920
have like they didn't even explain tails that's how it's going to work yeah i guess they didn't

488
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,400
explain fucking anything if if there is a detriment to this movie it's how little things

489
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,160
are explained but that's because it's a kid's movie yeah and also because it's a movie and

490
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,360
they were going to run out of time yeah yeah they could have done like a tails movie then a knuckles

491
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,080
movie they didn't have them do knuckles in the third and then the second one they can do in the

492
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,480
third one you know they could have figured it out they could have spread out the material to be

493
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,640
honest maybe they were afraid that they like it wouldn't like get trashing because like prequels

494
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,760
generally don't do as well as i wonder how this one's doing sorry sequels don't generally do as

495
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,640
well as the first first movie so i wonder how well this one's gonna do well i guess we'll find out

496
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,200
yeah when all the internet because like it's kind of funny because because this is going out of

497
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,440
theaters this week is this final week yeah yeah that's why i suggested we go yeah yeah so there

498
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,920
is a wider conversation here where like do you recall the backlash against like star wars and

499
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:26,640
people because they're all terrible yeah including episode seven was okay episodes eight and nine

500
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,320
were both fucking awful yeah and people are like here's a misogynist here's because there's a girl

501
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,120
and it's like no no no no you can have a girl in star wars i don't fucking care

502
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,640
there's leia like who fucking cares no it's because they're bad yeah that's the problem

503
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:46,160
is that they're they were just bad movies yeah and that was it yep um these aren't bad

504
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,400
oh hold on though okay okay i'm waiting i'm like that what i'm getting to what i'm getting to

505
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,080
is that there has there has this there's this growing feeling of

506
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,520
partial disdain for your own audience in hollywood so so the situation is something like

507
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,080
oh i have this vision for for for star wars and so i'm gonna make the movies that i want to make

508
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,200
and then the audience feedback comes in and they fucking hate it and they're like well fuck you

509
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,680
you're just a misogynist and it's like well maybe or maybe your movie is bad and maybe you should

510
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,160
kind of figure it out yeah now there are a few movies that buck the trend because joker was

511
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,880
beloved and people fucking there was there was like weird progressives or beloved oh isn't it

512
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,800
the same thing i don't think it is okay well in any case you know what i mean there were like

513
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,240
weird progressives when joker came out saying like this is just a this is just a a movie that

514
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,040
lionizes white male rage and it's like shut the fuck up you're so jesus christ you're so stupid

515
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:48,320
you don't understand anything about anything just fucking eat a bullet okay um in minecraft okay um

516
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:56,320
in minecraft okay um and then there was sonic because i don't know if you did you see like the

517
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,080
the first leaks of the sonic movie and how fucking awful it looked yeah i did yeah yeah

518
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,280
yeah no i remember that everyone knows about that if you don't know about that you literally don't

519
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,840
have the internet like it was everywhere and people are like what the fuck like this looks

520
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,960
fucking terrible and then the company was like you know what okay we'll fix it yep well fair enough

521
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,560
and then they did right before the movie came out there were people who were saying

522
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:27,360
do not do not give in to the fans what do they they are entitled spoiled fucking misogynist

523
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,480
you know fucking reactionary brats do not give make the movie that you want to make don't give

524
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,600
them don't do what the fans want you to do and the song the the the uh the whoever made this

525
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,080
movie i don't know who they were they um they said how about we actually do what the fans want

526
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,840
and then the movie came out and it was a hit because it didn't look awful and i remember

527
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:55,120
that i sonic looked like a terrible stuffed like like what an off-brand stuffed animal

528
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:01,520
would look like if they had made that as a sonic doll and and and what's what's funny is like

529
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,040
this i think it's partially because the fans finally felt listened to the for the first time

530
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,360
in a while yeah this is like single-handedly revived sonic oh yeah 100 yeah like sonic was

531
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,560
a dead franchise there's no making games they all sucked like sonic forces sucked

532
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,840
um all sonic games are bad you've heard it here first that's not true that's not true

533
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,360
like recent sonic games have not been so good and sonic forces was absolutely fucking terrible

534
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:29,680
people had basically like sonic ever since like sonic heroes sonic has been known as this fucking

535
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,120
failed franchise and it's been like 20 games since sonic heroes there's been like two good ones

536
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,040
two or three um and then sonic forces come out and it was fucking trash and then people are just

537
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,600
like sonic is just fucking disgusting and then but this this this this movie was i don't know

538
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,840
how much money the first one made but it was so culturally successful that it basically revived

539
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,720
the sonic brand yeah and now we have a second movie and the second movie is it's still good

540
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,800
would you say is as good as the first i actually i would say this time it's about on par with the

541
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:07,520
first i'm i think i'm gonna say about on par um it like it sequels always tend to be it was a little

542
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,680
less you know some of the emotional moments didn't hit as hard you think so yeah because

543
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,160
because it was about um him tom it was about him and tom bonding and like sonic like

544
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,960
reaching adulthood you know but like coming like coming into his own after being on his own for so

545
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,800
long then in this movie he's still not on his own because he's uh he's like family but like tom just

546
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,280
wanted him to have like more people to hang out with other than just his parents yeah because he

547
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,920
can't go outside like he's a fucking alien yeah exactly yeah so then that that's more or less what

548
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,080
this movie was about but it didn't i feel like it didn't quite touch on that enough slash hard

549
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,960
enough slash hard enough slash hard enough slash hard yeah i couldn't make that into a proper

550
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:01,680
sentence there you go um so yeah yeah i think it's worth seeing if you like the first one oh

551
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,440
yeah definitely if you like the first one was good if you like the first one uh definitely watch this

552
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,440
one just remember that if you haven't seen the first one well obviously if you want like the

553
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,000
sonic lore to be exact you know it's not gonna be but it's fine it's still a good movie it's still

554
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,200
a good yeah just don't forget that it is specifically for like it's definitely catered to

555
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,000
children yeah yes like if you're a parent and you have like a nine-year-old that likes sonic they're

556
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,120
gonna love the shit out of it oh yeah they're gonna love it and watch it forever and that's

557
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,800
what you're gonna be watching for the next uh month two months about two months maybe three

558
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,280
maybe six maybe six happier maybe maybe until the next sonic movie comes out yeah you know

559
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,800
maybe yeah yeah so since jim carrey's retiring oh no i mean how what are you gonna do for sonic 3

560
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,080
they might get him back for sonic 3 yeah because here's the thing i heard that like

561
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,600
i kept i kept hearing that like jim carrey just wanted out of hollywood because it fucking sucked

562
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,000
yeah but he actually like he liked the robotnik role yeah and he was having fun with it he was

563
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,280
definitely having fun with it like i i didn't feel like he was a little slightly less funny

564
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,760
this time i said that in the theater i felt like it felt slightly less like the because in the

565
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,720
first movie jim carrey was definitely like jim carrying it up you know like he was being jim

566
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,920
care it was just funny this one it was just funny i but it definitely felt like he was kind of like

567
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,400
i want to say holding himself back a little bit for the character to come through a little more

568
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,680
you think so he's definitely still had his like jim carrie isms jim carrie isms jim carrie isms in

569
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,160
it you know it's still really good i'm not saying he wasn't funny it just like it felt like it felt

570
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,720
it felt slightly different from the first movie yeah and then to be honest i don't know if i agree

571
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,320
with you but i still like it i honestly probably have to watch them back to back because it's

572
