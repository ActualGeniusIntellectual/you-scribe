{"text": " Hey everyone! Between this video today and the garden video yesterday I bet some people are asking where's the politics content? Don't worry the politics content hasn't gone anywhere the weekly sip is still happening tomorrow and there will be new 10 minute take politics videos and other types of politics videos coming next week. The reason that I'm doing this sort of stuff is well one I wanted to get out the garden video yesterday because frankly my grandmother is she's she's in her 90s now and we we don't know when she's going to pass on so I would like her to see at least some of the garden stuff she absolutely loves those garden videos I don't want to wait until the end of summer this time to actually put one out I'd rather just do you know a spring one and a summer one and an autumn one just in case she doesn't she doesn't last throughout 2022. I know that sounds harsh but you mean you you know what I mean but as for this video if you go into the backlog of this channel I'm talking way back way before SFO was ever about politics this is pre-gamergate stuff you'll find at least a few videos I think are still online of me and Dave doing a series called trailer talk and I think we talked about uh man of steel back when that was a new movie we talked about star trek into darkness I think we did one about the hobbit you know this is all you know stuff that was nine or ten years ago and all of those trailer talks were basically recorded as soon as possible right when we left the theater so we could actually give like an honest opinion of it we always kind of envisioned a trailer talk to be the kind of thing where we go to explicitly a very late night screening maybe even like a midnight show of a movie and then in the darkness of the parking lot or in one case in the darkness of our backyard we talked about the movie in the middle of the night and it was supposed to be kind of this quiet private intimate little discussion about movies and the main reason we kind of let that series die around 2014 is because none of us had a car anymore to go to the movie theater but now that we have a car and now that covid is no more I do want to revive the trailer talk series I'm not going to revive it on SFO this is still a politics channel I'm uploading the first new one right here just to let you know and any future trailer talks are going to appear over on the dev kit channel the dev kit channel is basically my personal channel where I do tech stuff I do unboxings I do reviews I do trailer talks now basically anything that's not politics and that isn't part of the game boomers you know let's play thing I'm gonna put up on dev kit it is a channel that is mainly my personal channel and not necessarily you know SFO the brand but nonetheless I would still appreciate it if you decided to follow it and keep up with what I'm doing there because I know that Naomi likes going to movies so whenever we go to a movie maybe we'll shoot a trailer talk who knows but anyway I'm putting the first one up here just to let you know hope you enjoy it and if you want to see any more please head over to dev kit thank you very much guys new politics content coming after this I really appreciate you sticking around I'll see you next time I love you so we're back at this it's been about 10 years since we've actually done this this show on the channel 10 years years so for those of you who have been watching long before the politics stuff long before gamergate Dave and I did a show on this channel we have a half a dozen episodes or so called trailer talk but what we would do is you would go see a really late screening of a movie yeah really late and then it's like past past midnight right now yes yeah and then talk about it like basically the night of I forgot I already had some water here I'm so I had so much popcorn dude I'm gonna float away why why would you float away because I feel bloated but wouldn't you just sink instead of floating maybe but anyway we want today tonight we went out to the old cinema and now it's like 1am or whatever and we had we watched sonic the hedgehog 2 2 second one okay what the fuck's happening with this thing oh for the love of god I will open it will you yeah let's see will you yep yeah yep keep talking hold on I want to see this first free time before we talk about any fucking movie I want to see this shit will you open it maybe not this is more than the fucking movie was oh the movie wasn't that bad no it wasn't actually but this is for some reason I'm not opening well anyway so we saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2 now we also watched Sonic the Hedgehog 1 that came out like during the pandemic didn't it I don't remember that was eons ago was it it was the reason we're doing it the night of is because I'll forget yeah I'll forget all my opinions my tomorrow even though technically it is tomorrow we watched Sonic 1 and how did we both feel about Sonic 1 we both liked Sonic 1 but it was very obviously a kids movie well yeah and so was this one well yeah but like like I mean like you can't go into it expecting it to be like like a good kids movie you know what I mean why not well no no okay no no I mean like a good drink good well you explained this a good kids movie for adults you know like yes there's references to the actual Sonic games and the movie but you have to expect going in that yes it's very simplified like there's lots of funny goofy moments there's no swearing as it's for children specifically it's not for like teenagers kind of edging on the adults so adults can kind of enjoy it too no it's for kids yes definitely for children but this look good but you have to make sure that you know that they're for kids going into it yeah so the first Sonic was possible this is all staying in the family no have the water have the water I'm gonna okay so the first Sonic um Sonic likes to do this thing whenever they do like a like a I wouldn't say movie but a show or anything else what Sonic likes to do is they like to um basically throw in human characters and they always do like a Sonic comes to the human world situation happens it was Sonic X they did it with I think one of the comics they did it with a lot of Sonic properties because like the actual story of Sonic is Sonic lives in a world where at least the original Sonics like we're talking like Sonic one two and three and Sonic and Knuckles and um there's there was a bunch of situations where basically Sonic was fighting Robotnik and there's not much story to it and there's animal friends and there's there's magic and like Robotnik being the only human doesn't make any sense but you know what fuck it's it's a video game you know it was made it was made back in the 90s okay listen no no didn't you say that a premise to the Sonic game specifically was that they were all mutated animals that was later they added that to try and explain the original oh wait okay so since since they were trying to explain the original obviously Robotnik was the only human survivor because he was the only one smart enough to survive he wasn't it was actually a lot of humans just we don't see them until Sonic Adventure but yeah never mind basically like the idea from what I understand the whole Mobius which was the planet that they were all on was actually a far future earth where you have nuclear war and mutated animals and they're still humans that's why in Sonic Adventure there's like a city with humans and like a station square there's still a bunch of humans hanging around but there's also animals too and people are just okay with it because they've gotten used to it and the level of technology is like equivalent to like 90s earth because they've gotten back to that point but there's just a bunch of furries running around and so that was like the small furries that was the deep lore but of course they do for example in Sonic X it was that there was like an alternate universe there's always alternate universes there's a sonic universe and then there's the and there's like the human universe and there's always like Sonic gets iskaid over into the human universe and that's like it's iskaid I thought it was isekaid what a wrong fucking guy and that is what Sonic 1 ended up being it ended up being exactly what if you were going to do what every other time you've done Sonic yes they they they did a thing where you know he goes to the United States he goes to Green Hill the town called Green Hills and like is it Montana I don't know in the middle middle of trees in the middle of trees that's where it was yep for the rich people hosts yeah was there any reason for that opening bit in Sonic 2 to be set in Seattle I don't think so never came back to being in Seattle well no it was to set up the fact that Sonic still wanted to be a hero but why Seattle like the first movie why Seattle probably because it was semi close by okay maybe well or he heard that the crime was happening right that second in this iteration of the story Sonic is from another planet there's rings that the actual rings in the games they're they're basically teleportation devices you can open portals to go wherever you want to go they don't really explain it too hard because they're just having a good time and what ends up happening is Sonic he escaped he's on a planet with an owl mother which is like a new creation of this game and the Enkidna tribe is coming to kick the shit out of her to try and get the master mode you'll find out about the first movie but in the first movie he goes to he escapes he goes to earth he's raised by himself himself for a bit and then eventually this dude who finds him what was his name again he's so forgettable tom tom he's so forgettable he doesn't tom tom chowski whichowski or something he he had more of a thing he had more of a part in the first movie oh yeah no like okay tom guy tom guy he was in the second movie I don't remember that he was in the second movie and we're just watching okay real quickly first movie he ends up with tom robotnik is a defense contractor with the us government initially he's making drones and stuff he's doing his thing um and he ends up he the government wants him to fight sonic because he's an alien yes something like that but then he also ends he ends up taking the loss personally and so they had like this giant fight throughout the first movie they fight in san francisco well i'm just quickly getting through okay okay fine go and then by the end by the end of it um sonic tricks robotnik into going through a ring yeah and he ends up on a mushroom planet there's literally nothing about mushrooms it's only mushrooms mushrooms and rock yeah and there's there's a lot of uh really fun references in both movies actually the second movie had uh uh the um it's a coffee place called the mean bean which is obviously a reference to dr robotnik's mean bean machine i don't know what that is but i don't know but nail me are you fucking kidding the references okay but anyway yeah we're references yes but anyway anyway the point being is that uh that's the first movie the first movie was actually it was a pretty solid kids movie it was a bit cringy at times but it was still as all kids as all kids movies yes like you could do a lot worse with a kid's movie yeah it wasn't stupid no it wasn't um it was a bit too self-referential it's always this one they both like had too many like breaking jokes just that like the time when they're going down the um the uh the mountain and sonic calls knuckles the winter soldier i was like like i i i i get the fourth wall breaking stuff but you can't do too much of it and sonic always did too much of it always um too much for me but anyway second movie okay it opened with we opened with um robotnik making mushroom coffee after having been on the planet for a year trying to rebuild he has like a broken spaceship right yeah he got sent through with the broken machine it's a mech i think it's a mech something i don't even remember i think no the fight from during the fight in the first movie oh my god it doesn't matter he had a mech and the mech went through with him yes whatever the fuck he had in the final act of the first movie with with him anyway he's using the the parts from that to build a giant antenna to signal space to see who the fuck comes to the mushroom planet yet he had nothing else he's like i'm just gonna signal and he had like one of sonic's quills which had the like the sonic power which was he helped him use the energy from the quill to power the the yeah but basically it's um eggman robot they use both the robot again yeah they use both yeah but he basically he fires off this this laser and he's hoping someone shows up yeah and knuckle shows up well you have three randoms who are never explained show up yeah i don't know who the fuck those guys are they're they look like humans yeah they look like humans with like bird masks yeah but then then robotnik more or less kills them yeah yeah not graphically he more or less murders them with just traps goofy traps yeah and then knuckles comes through and he's like oh and then knuckles is just like he sees the quill and it's just like oh where did you get that and a black man deep black man voice i can't do i think it is interest elva who's doing this i don't know i can't do that voice i am not a man you get the quill sort of yeah anyway where do you get the quill and robot takes the like it's just like i'll just show you the way to earth let's go you know and and so they go and i can knuckles go off yeah and cut to san francisco yes seattle whatever it starts with an s and it's in america god damn it okay so what ends up happening is um those those three are never seen again that's kind of yeah no that's not explained why no but it's not explained why they're there yeah and then suddenly knuckles comes through the same portal yeah like it's not it's not explained at all because spoiler alert really early into this the entire echidna tribe is dead well they always were though yeah i know yeah he's always the last kid knows the joke oh fuck okay yeah yeah in sonic 3 here's the thing in sonic 3 he's the last echidna yeah but then when it comes to um they don't explain that they explain it in sonic adventures which is like the next game with a story because there's a game in between like just yes yes there's no story but like in sonic adventure there's like you go to the the um the temple of the echidnas and it's like overgrown like a big jungle yeah and you see flashbacks like a bunch of echidnas running around um but anyway the point being what anyway the point being yeah the point being is that in this movie um sonic's running around seattle and he's like massively fucking up stopping a robbery of a armored car he destroys an entire city block trying to stop an armored car and almost kills many civilians many times and there's like and he's trying to do like the batman thing and they're like cleaning it up and he's like he's also like justice yeah he's wise cracking a whole bunch yeah like spider-man except worse yeah yeah but he's trying to be batman but he's more spider-man yeah and then he like he fucks everything up and he like a bunch of people get hurt but no no no no one got hurt but he almost killed many people no one can get hurt as a pg movie yeah many people almost got killed no one actually got killed and a lot of things destroyed an entire city block a lot of entire city block and then he goes i saved you and they're all like fuck you sonic you know the tight-up guard was like you're a terrible hero yeah and like sonic not even faze runs home to green hills or yeah of course it's green hills it was first i don't know are you fucking kidding me i don't fucking know so okay so he runs home to green hills uh by the next day and he's like trying to pretend that he's um he was like asleep all night yep he's doing the bruce wayne thing got caught by and then like his dad i guess um tom is like listen you can't you can't you're don't be reckless don't be reckless because you're still a kid and yeah sonic's at 16. sonic was always a kid yeah as long as a kid so he's ariel's age so sonic's a kid who little mermaid fuck you who wanted to go off into her own thing which was 14 i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure in the disney movie she's 16 okay well anyway anyway anyway um so that whole thing happens and then they they're going off to uh tom and his wife they're going off to hawaii for a destination wedding and sonic is like i'll just send you there with one of my teleportation rings and they go and then like sonic's at home and he has he does he destroys the house yeah he doesn't he destroys the house he does the thing that like every teenager generally does when they're left alone for the first time is they just fucking party and sonic just fucking party by himself he partied by himself yeah well i mean fuck he doesn't like he's an alien like no no i know but like it was actually with a dog he partnered with the dog but you know what's weird though is that i feel like that was supposed to be like that pitbull yeah the guy who has no like friends moments but it wasn't sonic was just having a really good fucking time fucking like he trashes the house with a bunch of food and then he drives the riding lawnmower through the through the house to like mulch the food up and spread it across the that was hilarious that was so gross like imagine just like 18 bags of chips ripped open on the ground and then just like just drive right through everywhere but anyway to skip over the rest of that and he makes like a foam room with a pool but anyway and then and then he cleans it up all cleans it all up in like 30 seconds when tom calls from hawaii because he can do that because he facetimes because facetime is a thing so now you actually have to clean up the room before you answer the phone yeah yes um but anyway what ends up happening is robotnik comes back yeah robotnik shows up with knuckles and beats the fuck out of sonic yeah knuckles kicks the shit out of sonic and he's fucking done and then there's tails tails tails never really explained tails does not explain he they give him like a couple lines where they explain a little bit but he basically shows up the couple of lines were hey uh you gave up a shit ton of energy and it got to my home planet and i've been stalking you you're really cool and i love you and i've been stalking you yeah that's the most strange this is strange um and sonic isn't even a face he's like you even watched me in the shower and tails is like that's a trick question sonic prefers bubble baths and sonic isn't phased at all it's weird okay with it that was weird yeah it was weird it was a weird moment and it's never dressed ever again but like like tails mentions his village once but like we don't get to know anything about tails you don't know why you don't really why you showed up it's just like i like you sonic is like okay i guess no he came to warn sonic about knuckles yes he did but like but you can't say there's no reason for him okay but it's a shitty reason because yes but it's still a reason like it's shitty it's not there tails is in the movie because they put tails because they put tails in the script and no no it's because they put tails in the after credit sequence in the first movie oh that's why tails is in the movie well yes they had to put them in somehow yeah and they weren't and here's the thing like sonic one is i think just sonic sonic two like the games sonic two is sonic and tails versus robotnik and then sonic three they're like how about we try a story and so they add the floating island and the master emerald and they add um and they add knuckles who's the guardian and then um robotnik like tricks knuckles and it's the same story in the movie and then eventually um you get to the point where robotnik flies in and that goes to steal the master emerald and then knuckles is like oh my god sonic you actually weren't evil and then knuckles like uh sorry uh robotnik tasers him he tasers uh knuckles oh and then there's like a big fight with all of them at the end against against um robotnik so so they are basically they're doing the sonic three story they haven't introduced tails because tails is part of sonic two so tails just shows up and he's like i've been stalking you let me be your pal and sonic's like okay and then so they're on they bond in russia yeah it's like it's a kid's movie so they're just gonna be like okay fine but like yeah it wasn't really set up it was not but anyway so now uh tails shows up tails rescues him they go on like a little chase they get away not much of a chase how much of a chase but they get away it's pretty it's pretty much tail shows up hit snuggles with a car and they escape yep then they go to uh tom's friend's place wade yeah wade it's like his garage i hate him and like yeah he was just there for like a minute because he was from the first movie but he was just there for a minute and then he was like he's the deputy he's the deputy sheriff yeah the town he's an idiot but they go to his place because he was in the first movie he knows he knows what sonic so he goes there and then sonic's like yeah so in the first movie i got this map and the map is it turns out the map's the map to the master emerald oh and the master was hidden on earth yeah and it turns out that for just you know sonic touches the map i guess for the first time for the first time ever even because as soon as he touches it a big hologram comes out i was gonna point this out of the owl girl you know listen i was gonna point this out in the theater but i'm pretty sure we literally saw him touch the map earlier in the movie you think so i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure he actually opened it up and looked at it in the earlier part of the movie maybe it's because he touched the part that said master emerald on it maybe but anyway a coincidence a hologram shows up a hologram shows up of the of the owl of the owl mom sonic's owl mom and it's like listen listen sonic so if you're reading this if you if you're hearing this i'm dead master emerald's hidden on earth you gotta go find it find it there's here's your quest yeah onward and so it's like oh my god this i can finally be a hero and then so they and wade's like i guess i'm here like wade fucking does nothing wait wait was annoying that scene would have been better without him yeah but anyway then they go to russia yeah so they use it turns out that like the coordinates on the map lead to russia russia and so they go to russia and there's like there's an there's an interlude where they have a dance off with a bunch of russians they have a dance up like a like a like a dive russian a bar that's in a really nice building but it's like a dive bar in russia it's in the middle of a snowstorm in the middle of a snowstorm in the middle of the mountains yeah it's just a dive bar and there's a dance off because they somehow get a hold of the map they're just through through shenanigans yeah and they dance us for it and it's like okay so they have a dance off to summarize it's tales and sonic's bonding moment yeah for the movie it's the bonding moment it's the bonding moment yeah so they dance they dance off and they get they get the map back but like there's there's not much to it like it's kind of goofy like they dance yeah because it's a kids movie you can kind of forgive the fact they go on wild tangents sometimes because uh this would be not be acceptable in adults but what the fuck is this like yeah it's funny at least it's funny it's still it's still a fine kids movie um get the map they find a temple in an ice in the mountains we're assuming in the side of a mountain somewhere they didn't actually show us how they got into it suddenly they were in the mountain range with the paramount symbol actually the mount was like the paramount was actually pretty funny and then they're suddenly in the temple so we're assuming it's in the side of the mountain somewhere so so tails flies holding sonic you know and in the usual sonic 2 way where he has like his arms they fly into a hole in the side of a mountain yeah i think i missed that but they fly into a hole in the side of like a big ice like glacier in a mountain they go in and then okay well i'm still right and they land and then there's a giant owl door and they're like oh i guess humans never discovered this place before even though it's like in the russian mountains it's fine well maybe because it's in the Russian everyone just dies up there okay yeah yeah it's Russia yeah so they go in there um they poke around the temple they do like the new traps and and puzzles and then Sonic when she finds a compass and the compass the compass points to the location of the emerald and it's like okay well now we're one step closer then um yeah then Knuckles and Robotnik catch up and they show they have another fight everyone gets beaten up everyone gets beaten up but then Sonic decides to escape by using a um a piece of a mech as a snowboard because he's done that several times in the games so they're snowboarding down and then Knuckles also does the same thing there's a wave flying in the sky yeah and snow and Sonic is snowboarding down the mountain while all Robotnik's robots are like exploding the mountain like beside and behind him there's lots of explosions yeah and then Knuckles comes and beats him up and then Tails also gets beaten up and Tails becomes unconscious because he gets hit with rockets yes and then it turns out that um and then both Robotnik and Knuckles escape with the compass yeah they get away okay hold on I want to tell this part okay so there's a bit at this point where Sonic's this is like this is the second act of the story yeah where like Sonic is down and out I want to point out this does not feel like the second act of the story but it is but it is yeah Sonic's down and out Robotnik and Knuckles are now ahead in the race to find the master emerald they have the compass and a giant and a giant uh a snow avalanche a giant giant snowstorm on the mountain a giant avalanche is coming towards Sonic and the unconscious Tails yeah so Sonic's carrying Tails like this and snowboarding again yeah and so we're both pretty sure he lost the snowboard he found another one it's fine and he's like I gotta get the fuck out of here somehow yeah because he lost all of his teleport rings yes so he calls up Tom Tom who's at who's at Hawaii who's in Hawaii and here's the thing Tom has one teleport ring to get back from from the trip yeah but he accidentally due to his shenanigans he mixes it up with the wedding ring yep yeah so Tom is like Sonic calls him and he's like Sonic's like listen you gotta get I'm gonna fucking die in the middle of the wedding ceremony yeah and Tom's okay I'll do it and then Tom pulls out the wedding ring and tries to use it to teleport and doesn't work because it's a wedding ring he's like oh fuck dude so he goes he runs up to the podium because he got mixed yeah he punches the groom in the face no that's not right away this is after a bit of back and forth tries to yes this is can I tell this he punches the groom in the face and then he like he gets the ring and then he throws it immediately like in front like in front of the wedding of the wedding yeah so the portal opens up and the entire avalanche comes into the wedding and destroys the wedding not like these not the entire avalanche enough of the avalanche to destroy the wedding like that was absolutely fucking hilarious yeah there's some very clever very funny things that happened yeah yeah it was pretty good yeah it was good but we were both screaming at Tom because we were alone in the theater because it's such a late movie this kid's movie right there's no one there was dude it was just us there was no one there it was just you and I and I was like is this even profitable for these guys that's what they make the money off the popcorn oh yeah we had popcorn fuck dude popcorn's expensive popcorn's expensive popcorn was always expensive holy shit dude there's a cab showing up I guess someone else's we just got out yep all right so yeah um once they get there uh the u.s government it turns out the wedding was actually a sham it was a catfish operation it was called operation catfish and the the bride's um husband was actually secret agent and the priest was secret agent and everyone's secret agent everyone was a secret agent and they're all at the woman it's a woman yeah it's a misogynistic movie guys and they're all working for gun now name we didn't care no i don't know gun is the guardian unit of nations from sonic adventure 2 they're the ones that that that did like the whole uh space the space colony arc and project shadow from sonic adventure 2 like they they have a big place in sonic lore and so but they made fun of the name immediately like did you call yourself gun really i get freaking he's like yeah why not but basically uh gun shows up kidnaps sonic entails and also tom because tom tries to fight them like an idiot tom punches more people in the face because that's the only thing he's really doing in this movie fucking up and punching people in the face there's a bit of like a there's like a half action sequence trying to rescue them there's not much of a one no no no the the action sequence is the two women who were part of the wedding party who should have been incarcerated with everyone like with the men yeah they just get left to their own devices so they have tails's technology and they use it to rescue them like by beating up all the guards yeah they have tails in the backpack here's the thing it's because he i keep saying this they didn't punch the gun members the way that tom did so they didn't get arrested the guy literally said this is the last time you're gonna be uh hiding in a bedding an alien you know and then only takes tom away i don't remember the wife's name you say bedding an alien i don't it's a bedding not bedding i said a bedding no i i said a bedding i said it with a d oh bedding yeah okay so anyway there's like a half action sequence that doesn't really go anywhere that where they rescue they rescue everyone stupid they subdue them misogynistic it was a misogynist it was it was why wasn't she incarcerated too because i'm just a girl anyway moving on stop thumping the car you're making the camera move okay actually stop okay you know so what ends up happening is sonic they're on they're on the shore of hawaii and they see a giant green beam off in the distance and that's because on a neighboring island the the compass has taken eggman and knuckles to the location of the master emerald yep and so they put the thing on and there's a little like a little daze on the beach and they put it in and then like does this giant uh moses thing where like the sea parts and there's a giant underwater temple yep because it's under the sea yeah yeah under the sea it's like sure that would have been discovered before but fine whatever so it's fine they you know what's funny though is that it wasn't even that far under no it was like 10 feet under yeah it doesn't open that much yeah so the you know um sonic is like i gotta fucking go over there she goes over there um almost dies almost has no way but you guys over there and there's like a big sequence under in the temple where there's like traps and goofiness yes but i i'm still indiana jones for kids i'm complaining because the temple was dusty and there was roots yep from from plants from plants but it was underwater it was underwater you know what's actually funny is that there was also plants i think you missed some of there was also plants in the tunnel in the temple yeah in the tunnel yeah it's like okay but yeah you know they're they're doing their thing they know their tropes okay fine um and then they get to the the chamber of the master emerald yep and then sonic comes crashing through the roof yeah accidentally he's like yeah the chamber somehow there's another sonic and knuckles fight yep uh which gets interrupted by eggman seeing the emerald because he always was going to sonic almost dies again yep but sonic rescues knuckles this time knuckles is sad because it turns out eggman wasn't really his friend yeah they decided to all go and take on um eggman together yep eggman um he returns to green hills yeah well after letting the emerald like consume him oh yeah he comes not a different person but he becomes green instead of red yeah he has like green like lightning bolt powers he's flying around like a god yeah he's doing like a very god-like things yeah um so god eggman i guess we'll call him i don't know god eggman works god eggman this is usually where you step in and call him a demigod he always correct me on those it's god eggman yeah whenever i say he's a god right like oh he's a demigod he said about sephiroth he said about the dragon spirits and skyward sword what else he said about like he's a demigod not a god no because okay you know what never mind we'll have this discussion later my fucking brain is dead from how loud the theater was our theater's always been this loud i don't know but like when i'm fucking loud when i myself like a little bit like a week two weeks ago yeah like it was loud like it was just like in my movie it was quieter it was still really loud yeah so oh by the way just don't go see the northman it's not that great you want to do a trailer talk in the northman no it's it's not that great don't go see it okay so what ends up happening guys is they decide to go fight him together and so tails like this all happens off screen but i think this is what happened he steals the biplane that was used to fly through the wedding to like to like rachel slash fiance's name for the number four forever yeah so tails takes the biplane upgrades it with guns because it's tails and yet he has to he somehow had time to do that he has to have a biplane yes it's tails it's tails always has a biplane yeah so and then they fly from hawaii back to what the green hills with a biplane with with the ring that they somehow acquired did they use the ring they used the ring they used the ring that they somehow acquired even though son had lost all of this i think knuckles picked them up knuckles picked up all the rings i think so i don't know because they fell off the cliff no no remember knuckles used a ring to get him an eggman to the island maybe knuckles picked up his rings like who knows but anyway they have some rings again whatever they they get back to green hills um and at that point eggman had returned to green hills because his his uh backup base was that was the mean bean yeah coffee place yeah and his his henchman is there just like playing playing a bunch of like just doing stuff and eggman shows up he has like he has no technology anymore because all of his all of his drones are fucked yeah but then he starts using the powers of the master emerald just to suck in all the metal in the area so like trains and cars and tanks and stuff this is also yes the the his base being surrounded by the government yep so he sucks everything all the metal in the town in into one location yeah and he build and he uses the powers to build a giant mech yeah and he starts fucking up the town with a giant mech and it's great and then uh sonic tails and knuckles fly in it on the on the biplane they have their big giant fight it's a this big extended action sequence um and then it turns out that the master emerald shatters after i think like knuckles okay okay yeah knuckles punch okay after you know the the huge fight they all they all they all get defeated by the mech and then you know they all group together and be like we have to fight him together as a team and then they do and then knuckles punters after sonic distracts eggman knuckles punches the emerald out of eggman's chest not in a bloody way just to the chest and emerald comes out the back and then so the mech falls the emerald falls sonic ends up dragging his half dead body over to it making this a lot more graphic than it actually so but here's the thing the emerald shatters the emerald the master emerald breaks yes and inside the master emerald are the seven chaos emeralds yes and i'm just like you have a huge grape wood i do because the seven chaos emeralds are a different thing than the goddamn master emerald they are different things but in this movie they're the same thing so the master emerald breaks it turns out the seven chaos emeralds on the side of it it turns out sonic we already knew the seven chaos technically inside yeah they mentioned it very early on yeah they got they got a throwaway line about it yeah um and i was like what the fuck um but then sonic uses the the the stop shaking the goddamn car jesus sonic uses the um master emerald sorry the chaos emerald to become supersonic he destroys eggman's mech um eggman somehow gets away of course he does he didn't they couldn't find his body in the big collapse no no you forgot the most important part sonic becomes ultimate sonic i said that supersonic oh yeah i didn't hear it you said ultimate in the theater so i assumed that's what the name was he he uses these i didn't say he uses the seven chaos emeralds to become supersonic which is the just a super saiyan super saiyan it's like dragon ball super saiyan but yeah you know what the fuck it is okay so um everyone but me and then when the power runs out the emeralds scatter because they're basically dragon balls they scatter um and then they're like well i guess we'll just all live in green hills now and they do and then actually this is after knuckles somehow fixes the master emerald with his hands oh he could do that in the games too that's actually fine he just goes and then it's fine yeah yep and the math but here's the thing he fixes the master emerald without having seven chaos emeralds in it so it still has some power but it's not the same thing like i don't know yeah so in in the original continuity um the master emerald kept the floating island floating yeah and it could also be used to regulate the powers of the seven chaos emeralds but it was never required to have the master emerald to to become supersonic or to become no i'm hyper knuckles or any other super forms um jesus christ i fucking remember all this shit i remember all this shit when i was a kid okay anyway the end of the movie they all live happily ever after in green hills till the next movie yeah and um including like like tails knuckles just move in with them i guess they're just all hanging out now they're all kids now oh and the pivotal emotional moment is when sonic calls tom dad yeah you're my dad and he's like my son's a freak my son's a fucking alien no it is this is clark kent superman shit this is an him and his wife are totally fine with it i don't even remember the wife's name i don't actually think they imagine i'm just surprised that she's black why um because you don't usually see a white guy with a black girl in like in hollywood yeah but they're trying to change that now because wokeness yeah which is i i you know what i mean i guess yes okay non-white guys with white girls that's wokeness white guys with non-white girls that's just based i'm trolling i'm trolling i swear to god yeah so anyway anyway um the the post credit sequence is is are the gun guys cleaning up the eggman mess yep and they discover there's a a secret black site research facility where for 50 years they've been building shadow shadow with a quick cameo from dr eggman's assistant so we know that dr eggman's definitely alive yeah definitely yeah um and and here's the thing i said this to you in the in the theater um the story of sonic adventure 2 which is the shadow story is predicated on sonic adventure 1 yeah because sonic adventure 1 was was the story of the ancient echidnas and how they had this they fought this um this primordial this primordial god inside the master emerald called i think it's called chaos he's like he's like a blue goo man and when he absorbs when he absorbs um emeralds he becomes stronger and then by the end of the game um there's a giant chaos monster destroying the city and like millions are dead because it's like flooded and there's like it's fucking awful and you play super sonic and you and you defeat them i think they just switched it for the owls yeah but this like if they had actually made sonic adventure the movie that would have been fucking amazing probably because that game was actually really good it was like it's probably the best sonic game i think um and then sonic adventure 2 is a direct sequel where the idea is that robotnik's grandfather was in charge of a satellite um a a space colony called called space colony arc and they were they were using the knowledge of chaos that the echidnas had to like they were making like false chaoses to use them as like like weapons um and they but also at the same time uh they were i think were they trying to clone sonic but basically they they ended up making shadow as as an experiment with with the emeralds and shadow is just as fast as sonic he is he's basically what knuckles should have been like you know the coil he's he's just emo sonic and everyone loves him yes and then he also like falls in love with a human woman no what happens is um princess nope okay nope so what happens is um this is a robotnik's grandfather was running the whole project yeah and she he had a daughter and this daughter was growing up on the space station and she and shadow were friends yep but when they shut the project down because the chaos creatures went out of control um gun basically went up there and purged everyone and killed everyone yeah and shadow she like shadow uh was locked away by her i think and so he was put into a tube for 50 years and she got like all she riddled up with bullets she was fucking destroyed she was just shot shot the fuck up it was kind of a tragic scene actually um and then shadow's like you know what i'm just gonna kill all of humanity fuck all of you look what you fuck you you killed my only friend fuck you that's getting a good villain origin story i'm okay with that yeah and and what ends up happening is like um in sonic adventure 2 robotnik like turns good because he's like maybe we should maybe you know okay i mean my grandfather was kind of terrible because my grandfather after like the grandfather after seeing his daughter died he like he's he set up a whole bunch of shit that went down 50 years later to try and destroy the world and robotics like maybe i should stop this so he like helps out robotnik turns good finally which is not that common in the series actually but he turned good this time oh that's gonna be weird for them to do that because robotic is like really evil he's really evil he's like he's significantly more evil than the games like he he's not just like yeah i like was kind of like uh this not a shitty scientist but i was a misunderstood scientist and now i'm just also a mad scientist no like he's he's a mad scientist he's he's he's he's chaotic evil he's actually he's still very funny though he's really goofy like jim carrey does a really good job yeah i like it a lot he did a great job in the first we did a great job in this movie it's funny it's really funny when i heard that jim carrey was going to be dr robonic i don't know that that like to be fair i don't know that much about sonic but from like the little bit i do know i was like that's gonna be fucking awful like it was actually really good he did such a good job also because like robotics fat and he's not fat but it's like whatever yeah it doesn't matter too much yeah it kind of matters but not really like it here's the thing here's the thing they're still using all like the imagery and everything yeah and and and the thing is if he had done a bad job i probably matter about the not fat thing but he did such a good job it is such a good job so there's there's like um there's there's probably the funniest line i think is when like he's flying around like a god inside of the mech and his assistant who's in like a pilot seat or like the co-pilot seat is like sir you're magnificent and he's like thank you sycophant yeah your admiration was inevitable and i was like yes like he just renames his lackey there yeah to like like he has like all these different names for him you just they're all insulting yeah and we're pretty sure that the lackey's in love with him but we're not entirely sure yeah like there's there's a there's a lot of one-way homoeroticism coming from the lackey towards robotnik yeah and robotic doesn't even care he like he doesn't like abuse him or anything necessarily but he's like he doesn't even notice that it's happening yeah he doesn't even know he's a giant fucking narcissist like yeah of course people love him i love me everyone loves me yeah if you don't i'll just kill you yeah so it it turns out that they're going to be doing for for the third movie they're going to do shadow story shadow story from sonic adventure 2 which i think is not gonna work out unless they somehow do sonic adventure 1 at the same time because this movie kind of did do sonic 2 and 3 and knuckles all at the same time yeah so maybe they could do like they could do like the first act of the movie is them going to be explaining maybe sonic adventures and then they're going to move on maybe i don't know because that's how we know that's how it's going to work because they have like they didn't even explain tails that's how it's going to work yeah i guess they didn't explain fucking anything if if there is a detriment to this movie it's how little things are explained but that's because it's a kid's movie yeah and also because it's a movie and they were going to run out of time yeah yeah they could have done like a tails movie then a knuckles movie they didn't have them do knuckles in the third and then the second one they can do in the third one you know they could have figured it out they could have spread out the material to be honest maybe they were afraid that they like it wouldn't like get trashing because like prequels generally don't do as well as i wonder how this one's doing sorry sequels don't generally do as well as the first first movie so i wonder how well this one's gonna do well i guess we'll find out yeah when all the internet because like it's kind of funny because because this is going out of theaters this week is this final week yeah yeah that's why i suggested we go yeah yeah so there is a wider conversation here where like do you recall the backlash against like star wars and people because they're all terrible yeah including episode seven was okay episodes eight and nine were both fucking awful yeah and people are like here's a misogynist here's because there's a girl and it's like no no no no you can have a girl in star wars i don't fucking care there's leia like who fucking cares no it's because they're bad yeah that's the problem is that they're they were just bad movies yeah and that was it yep um these aren't bad oh hold on though okay okay i'm waiting i'm like that what i'm getting to what i'm getting to is that there has there has this there's this growing feeling of partial disdain for your own audience in hollywood so so the situation is something like oh i have this vision for for for star wars and so i'm gonna make the movies that i want to make and then the audience feedback comes in and they fucking hate it and they're like well fuck you you're just a misogynist and it's like well maybe or maybe your movie is bad and maybe you should kind of figure it out yeah now there are a few movies that buck the trend because joker was beloved and people fucking there was there was like weird progressives or beloved oh isn't it the same thing i don't think it is okay well in any case you know what i mean there were like weird progressives when joker came out saying like this is just a this is just a a movie that lionizes white male rage and it's like shut the fuck up you're so jesus christ you're so stupid you don't understand anything about anything just fucking eat a bullet okay um in minecraft okay um in minecraft okay um and then there was sonic because i don't know if you did you see like the the first leaks of the sonic movie and how fucking awful it looked yeah i did yeah yeah yeah no i remember that everyone knows about that if you don't know about that you literally don't have the internet like it was everywhere and people are like what the fuck like this looks fucking terrible and then the company was like you know what okay we'll fix it yep well fair enough and then they did right before the movie came out there were people who were saying do not do not give in to the fans what do they they are entitled spoiled fucking misogynist you know fucking reactionary brats do not give make the movie that you want to make don't give them don't do what the fans want you to do and the song the the the uh the whoever made this movie i don't know who they were they um they said how about we actually do what the fans want and then the movie came out and it was a hit because it didn't look awful and i remember that i sonic looked like a terrible stuffed like like what an off-brand stuffed animal would look like if they had made that as a sonic doll and and and what's what's funny is like this i think it's partially because the fans finally felt listened to the for the first time in a while yeah this is like single-handedly revived sonic oh yeah 100 yeah like sonic was a dead franchise there's no making games they all sucked like sonic forces sucked um all sonic games are bad you've heard it here first that's not true that's not true like recent sonic games have not been so good and sonic forces was absolutely fucking terrible people had basically like sonic ever since like sonic heroes sonic has been known as this fucking failed franchise and it's been like 20 games since sonic heroes there's been like two good ones two or three um and then sonic forces come out and it was fucking trash and then people are just like sonic is just fucking disgusting and then but this this this this movie was i don't know how much money the first one made but it was so culturally successful that it basically revived the sonic brand yeah and now we have a second movie and the second movie is it's still good would you say is as good as the first i actually i would say this time it's about on par with the first i'm i think i'm gonna say about on par um it like it sequels always tend to be it was a little less you know some of the emotional moments didn't hit as hard you think so yeah because because it was about um him tom it was about him and tom bonding and like sonic like reaching adulthood you know but like coming like coming into his own after being on his own for so long then in this movie he's still not on his own because he's uh he's like family but like tom just wanted him to have like more people to hang out with other than just his parents yeah because he can't go outside like he's a fucking alien yeah exactly yeah so then that that's more or less what this movie was about but it didn't i feel like it didn't quite touch on that enough slash hard enough slash hard enough slash hard enough slash hard yeah i couldn't make that into a proper sentence there you go um so yeah yeah i think it's worth seeing if you like the first one oh yeah definitely if you like the first one was good if you like the first one uh definitely watch this one just remember that if you haven't seen the first one well obviously if you want like the sonic lore to be exact you know it's not gonna be but it's fine it's still a good movie it's still a good yeah just don't forget that it is specifically for like it's definitely catered to children yeah yes like if you're a parent and you have like a nine-year-old that likes sonic they're gonna love the shit out of it oh yeah they're gonna love it and watch it forever and that's what you're gonna be watching for the next uh month two months about two months maybe three maybe six maybe six happier maybe maybe until the next sonic movie comes out yeah you know maybe yeah yeah so since jim carrey's retiring oh no i mean how what are you gonna do for sonic 3 they might get him back for sonic 3 yeah because here's the thing i heard that like i kept i kept hearing that like jim carrey just wanted out of hollywood because it fucking sucked yeah but he actually like he liked the robotnik role yeah and he was having fun with it he was definitely having fun with it like i i didn't feel like he was a little slightly less funny this time i said that in the theater i felt like it felt slightly less like the because in the first movie jim carrey was definitely like jim carrying it up you know like he was being jim care it was just funny this one it was just funny i but it definitely felt like he was kind of like i want to say holding himself back a little bit for the character to come through a little more you think so he's definitely still had his like jim carrie isms jim carrie isms jim carrie isms in it you know it's still really good i'm not saying he wasn't funny it just like it felt like it felt it felt slightly different from the first movie yeah and then to be honest i don't know if i agree with you but i still like it i honestly probably have to watch them back to back because it's actually let's go watch it again no it's been a while since i've seen the first one so i might be totally wrong to be fair but you know yep so yeah yeah um is there anything else you want to say about sonic 2 that's good are we gonna see the third one yeah when it comes out i want to see emo sonic oh i'm ready i'm ready all right give me my lovable villain yeah so um i think the first one of these trailer talks will come out on the main channel just to kind of kick start the series again but the rest of them from now on if we keep doing more they're gonna go on finally the dev kit channel is finally opening up i have that intro made by butters everything is good to go so we're gonna probably do more of these over on that channel so make sure you sub to it okay oh you you're just gonna like make that your your reviewing channel ish yeah the dev kit okay the dev kit channel is going to be my non-political channel where i put whatever the fuck i want boomers that was the gaming channel okay the dev kit is going to be like give me some tech stuff there so guys you've heard it here games and politics are intrinsically linked stay tuned interestingly linked i can't say that word intrinsically intrinsically listen listen i can't say it dev kit is going to be just for is going to be for um non-political reviews is going to be for stuff like this is going to be for unboxings new equipment is going to be for tech teardowns is going to be for just that's gonna be like my personal channel basically i thought game boomers was your personal channel that's the gaming channel fuck okay listen we're gonna get out of here thanks go watch sonic it's pretty good um go actually watch it and not just pirate it yeah i guess it's worth it it's worth it yeah it's it's it's a little bit worth your money um i might just i might just wait till it till it comes out like not in theaters because man theater's still fucking so even we had it to ourselves ourselves it was so loud though i don't know how many of you have been to a theater it was so loud i haven't no i i i i don't miss the theater going experience now that we've done this i slightly enjoyed just because we were by ourselves i liked you know i like getting i like getting theater popcorn i just like it there's literally nothing else like it you want to go into like a packed theater and be like no be like elbow to elbow with some fucking fat greasy loser who's like eating a whole fucking pizza just i was fuck you i didn't get pizza yeah like dude theaters are fucking disgusting at this point fuck well that's why we have the theater to ourselves yeah it's quite nice yeah right late night shows guys if you slightly i still don't know why despite you having the whole you had the whole theater you still had to get like we had to still like rub elbows in there oh my god my boyfriend is complaining that we had to sit beside each other one seat in between to like put our stuff in you know yeah stuff just goes beside you fine no hand holding for you fuck you i'm putting my seat belt on and drive it away listen if there were like two arm rests nope then it'd be makes sense but no this is car talks we're done car talks is that the name of the show now car talks all right guys we'll see you next time thanks for
