Hey everyone! Between this video today and the garden video yesterday I bet some people are asking

00:04.400 --> 00:08.480
where's the politics content? Don't worry the politics content hasn't gone anywhere the weekly

00:08.480 --> 00:13.040
sip is still happening tomorrow and there will be new 10 minute take politics videos and other

00:13.040 --> 00:17.920
types of politics videos coming next week. The reason that I'm doing this sort of stuff is well

00:17.920 --> 00:22.080
one I wanted to get out the garden video yesterday because frankly my grandmother is

00:22.720 --> 00:29.280
she's she's in her 90s now and we we don't know when she's going to pass on so I would like her

00:29.280 --> 00:34.000
to see at least some of the garden stuff she absolutely loves those garden videos I don't

00:34.000 --> 00:39.840
want to wait until the end of summer this time to actually put one out I'd rather just do you know

00:39.840 --> 00:44.560
a spring one and a summer one and an autumn one just in case she doesn't she doesn't last

00:44.560 --> 00:49.280
throughout 2022. I know that sounds harsh but you mean you you know what I mean but as for this

00:49.280 --> 00:55.040
video if you go into the backlog of this channel I'm talking way back way before SFO was ever about

00:55.040 --> 01:00.720
politics this is pre-gamergate stuff you'll find at least a few videos I think are still online

01:00.720 --> 01:08.480
of me and Dave doing a series called trailer talk and I think we talked about uh man of steel back

01:08.480 --> 01:12.240
when that was a new movie we talked about star trek into darkness I think we did one about the

01:12.240 --> 01:18.000
hobbit you know this is all you know stuff that was nine or ten years ago and all of those trailer

01:18.000 --> 01:22.080
talks were basically recorded as soon as possible right when we left the theater so we could

01:22.080 --> 01:26.080
actually give like an honest opinion of it we always kind of envisioned a trailer talk to be

01:26.080 --> 01:31.600
the kind of thing where we go to explicitly a very late night screening maybe even like a midnight

01:31.600 --> 01:37.440
show of a movie and then in the darkness of the parking lot or in one case in the darkness of our

01:37.440 --> 01:42.480
backyard we talked about the movie in the middle of the night and it was supposed to be kind of

01:42.480 --> 01:48.000
this quiet private intimate little discussion about movies and the main reason we kind of let

01:48.000 --> 01:54.480
that series die around 2014 is because none of us had a car anymore to go to the movie theater

01:54.480 --> 02:00.720
but now that we have a car and now that covid is no more I do want to revive the trailer talk series

02:00.720 --> 02:05.440
I'm not going to revive it on SFO this is still a politics channel I'm uploading the first new one

02:05.440 --> 02:10.080
right here just to let you know and any future trailer talks are going to appear over on the

02:10.080 --> 02:15.120
dev kit channel the dev kit channel is basically my personal channel where I do tech stuff I do

02:15.120 --> 02:21.280
unboxings I do reviews I do trailer talks now basically anything that's not politics and that

02:21.280 --> 02:26.560
isn't part of the game boomers you know let's play thing I'm gonna put up on dev kit it is a channel

02:26.560 --> 02:31.360
that is mainly my personal channel and not necessarily you know SFO the brand but nonetheless

02:31.360 --> 02:35.520
I would still appreciate it if you decided to follow it and keep up with what I'm doing there

02:35.520 --> 02:39.920
because I know that Naomi likes going to movies so whenever we go to a movie maybe we'll shoot

02:39.920 --> 02:43.760
a trailer talk who knows but anyway I'm putting the first one up here just to let you know hope

02:43.760 --> 02:48.400
you enjoy it and if you want to see any more please head over to dev kit thank you very much

02:48.400 --> 02:52.720
guys new politics content coming after this I really appreciate you sticking around I'll see

02:52.720 --> 02:59.120
you next time I love you so we're back at this it's been about 10 years since we've actually done

02:59.120 --> 03:07.760
this this show on the channel 10 years years so for those of you who have been watching long

03:07.760 --> 03:12.400
before the politics stuff long before gamergate Dave and I did a show on this channel we have

03:12.480 --> 03:17.760
a half a dozen episodes or so called trailer talk but what we would do is you would go see

03:17.760 --> 03:25.120
a really late screening of a movie yeah really late and then it's like past past midnight right

03:25.120 --> 03:31.920
now yes yeah and then talk about it like basically the night of I forgot I already had some water

03:31.920 --> 03:37.280
here I'm so I had so much popcorn dude I'm gonna float away why why would you float away because I

03:37.280 --> 03:46.160
feel bloated but wouldn't you just sink instead of floating maybe but anyway we want today

03:46.160 --> 03:51.040
tonight we went out to the old cinema and now it's like 1am or whatever and we had we watched

03:51.040 --> 03:56.480
sonic the hedgehog 2 2 second one okay what the fuck's happening with this thing oh for the love

03:56.480 --> 04:07.840
of god I will open it will you yeah let's see will you yep yeah yep keep talking hold on I

04:07.840 --> 04:11.760
want to see this first free time before we talk about any fucking movie I want to see this shit

04:12.960 --> 04:16.960
will you open it maybe not this is more than the fucking movie was

04:18.720 --> 04:23.120
oh the movie wasn't that bad no it wasn't actually but this is for some reason I'm not opening

04:24.080 --> 04:33.440
well anyway so we saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2 now we also watched Sonic the Hedgehog 1 that came out

04:33.440 --> 04:38.080
like during the pandemic didn't it I don't remember that was eons ago was it it was the

04:38.080 --> 04:44.160
reason we're doing it the night of is because I'll forget yeah I'll forget all my opinions

04:44.160 --> 04:50.080
my tomorrow even though technically it is tomorrow we watched Sonic 1 and how did we both feel about

04:50.080 --> 04:56.400
Sonic 1 we both liked Sonic 1 but it was very obviously a kids movie well yeah and so was this

04:56.400 --> 05:02.080
one well yeah but like like I mean like you can't go into it expecting it to be like like a good

05:02.080 --> 05:07.280
kids movie you know what I mean why not well no no okay no no I mean like a good drink good well

05:07.280 --> 05:13.760
you explained this a good kids movie for adults you know like yes there's references to the actual

05:13.760 --> 05:19.840
Sonic games and the movie but you have to expect going in that yes it's very simplified like there's

05:19.840 --> 05:26.160
lots of funny goofy moments there's no swearing as it's for children specifically it's not for

05:26.160 --> 05:31.760
like teenagers kind of edging on the adults so adults can kind of enjoy it too no it's for kids

05:31.760 --> 05:36.880
yes definitely for children but this look good but you have to make sure that you know that

05:36.880 --> 05:41.760
they're for kids going into it yeah so the first Sonic was

05:42.720 --> 05:43.200
possible

05:46.640 --> 05:53.840
this is all staying in the family no have the water have the water I'm gonna okay so the first

05:53.840 --> 05:59.840
Sonic um Sonic likes to do this thing whenever they do like a like a I wouldn't say movie but

05:59.840 --> 06:09.680
a show or anything else what Sonic likes to do is they like to um basically throw in human characters

06:10.080 --> 06:16.320
and they always do like a Sonic comes to the human world situation happens it was Sonic X

06:16.960 --> 06:20.800
they did it with I think one of the comics they did it with a lot of Sonic properties

06:21.680 --> 06:26.960
because like the actual story of Sonic is Sonic lives in a world where at least the original

06:26.960 --> 06:31.760
Sonics like we're talking like Sonic one two and three and Sonic and Knuckles and um there's there

06:31.760 --> 06:41.760
was a bunch of situations where basically Sonic was fighting Robotnik and there's not much story

06:41.760 --> 06:47.600
to it and there's animal friends and there's there's magic and like Robotnik being the only

06:47.600 --> 06:51.200
human doesn't make any sense but you know what fuck it's it's a video game you know it was made

06:51.200 --> 06:55.520
it was made back in the 90s okay listen no no didn't you say that a premise to the Sonic game

06:55.520 --> 06:59.280
specifically was that they were all mutated animals that was later they added that to try

06:59.280 --> 07:03.120
and explain the original oh wait okay so since since they were trying to explain the original

07:03.120 --> 07:06.800
obviously Robotnik was the only human survivor because he was the only one smart enough to

07:06.800 --> 07:11.440
survive he wasn't it was actually a lot of humans just we don't see them until Sonic Adventure but

07:11.440 --> 07:16.960
yeah never mind basically like the idea from what I understand the whole Mobius which was the planet

07:16.960 --> 07:21.840
that they were all on was actually a far future earth where you have nuclear war and mutated

07:21.840 --> 07:25.440
animals and they're still humans that's why in Sonic Adventure there's like a city with humans

07:25.440 --> 07:29.440
and like a station square there's still a bunch of humans hanging around but there's also animals

07:29.440 --> 07:34.160
too and people are just okay with it because they've gotten used to it and the level of

07:34.160 --> 07:38.800
technology is like equivalent to like 90s earth because they've gotten back to that point but

07:38.800 --> 07:43.600
there's just a bunch of furries running around and so that was like the small furries that was

07:43.600 --> 07:49.440
the deep lore but of course they do for example in Sonic X it was that there was like an alternate

07:49.440 --> 07:52.640
universe there's always alternate universes there's a sonic universe and then there's the

07:53.600 --> 07:58.320
and there's like the human universe and there's always like Sonic gets iskaid over into the human

07:58.320 --> 08:02.960
universe and that's like it's iskaid I thought it was isekaid what a wrong fucking guy

08:07.120 --> 08:12.160
and that is what Sonic 1 ended up being it ended up being exactly what if you were going to do what

08:12.160 --> 08:16.720
every other time you've done Sonic yes they they they did a thing where you know he goes to the

08:16.720 --> 08:21.920
United States he goes to Green Hill the town called Green Hills and like is it Montana I don't

08:21.920 --> 08:28.240
know in the middle middle of trees in the middle of trees that's where it was yep for the rich

08:28.240 --> 08:32.960
people hosts yeah was there any reason for that opening bit in Sonic 2 to be set in Seattle I

08:32.960 --> 08:38.480
don't think so never came back to being in Seattle well no it was to set up the fact that Sonic still

08:38.480 --> 08:43.920
wanted to be a hero but why Seattle like the first movie why Seattle probably because it was semi

08:43.920 --> 08:49.760
close by okay maybe well or he heard that the crime was happening right that second in this

08:49.760 --> 08:54.880
iteration of the story Sonic is from another planet there's rings that the actual rings in

08:54.880 --> 08:58.080
the games they're they're basically teleportation devices you can open portals to go wherever you

08:58.080 --> 09:01.760
want to go they don't really explain it too hard because they're just having a good time

09:02.320 --> 09:08.160
and what ends up happening is Sonic he escaped he's on a planet with an owl mother which is like

09:08.160 --> 09:14.000
a new creation of this game and the Enkidna tribe is coming to kick the shit out of her to try and

09:14.000 --> 09:17.680
get the master mode you'll find out about the first movie but in the first movie he goes to

09:17.680 --> 09:22.800
he escapes he goes to earth he's raised by himself himself for a bit and then eventually

09:22.800 --> 09:28.080
this dude who finds him what was his name again he's so forgettable tom tom he's so forgettable

09:28.080 --> 09:35.360
he doesn't tom tom chowski whichowski or something he he had more of a thing he had more of a part in

09:35.360 --> 09:43.680
the first movie oh yeah no like okay tom guy tom guy he was in the second movie I don't remember

09:43.680 --> 09:49.600
that he was in the second movie and we're just watching okay real quickly first movie he ends

09:49.600 --> 09:55.440
up with tom robotnik is a defense contractor with the us government initially he's making drones and

09:55.440 --> 10:02.800
stuff he's doing his thing um and he ends up he the government wants him to fight sonic because

10:02.800 --> 10:07.760
he's an alien yes something like that but then he also ends he ends up taking the loss personally

10:07.760 --> 10:12.480
and so they had like this giant fight throughout the first movie they fight in san francisco well

10:12.800 --> 10:17.680
i'm just quickly getting through okay okay fine go and then by the end by the end of it um sonic

10:17.680 --> 10:22.720
tricks robotnik into going through a ring yeah and he ends up on a mushroom planet there's literally

10:22.720 --> 10:26.960
nothing about mushrooms it's only mushrooms mushrooms and rock yeah and there's there's a lot

10:26.960 --> 10:32.000
of uh really fun references in both movies actually the second movie had uh uh the um

10:32.800 --> 10:36.640
it's a coffee place called the mean bean which is obviously a reference to dr robotnik's mean

10:36.640 --> 10:42.720
bean machine i don't know what that is but i don't know but nail me are you fucking kidding

10:42.720 --> 10:51.520
the references okay but anyway yeah we're references yes but anyway anyway the point being

10:51.520 --> 10:55.280
is that uh that's the first movie the first movie was actually it was a pretty solid kids movie

10:55.280 --> 10:59.760
it was a bit cringy at times but it was still as all kids as all kids movies yes like you could do

10:59.760 --> 11:06.160
a lot worse with a kid's movie yeah it wasn't stupid no it wasn't um it was a bit too self-referential

11:06.240 --> 11:09.600
it's always this one they both like had too many like breaking jokes

11:11.280 --> 11:18.560
just that like the time when they're going down the um the uh the mountain and sonic

11:18.560 --> 11:26.160
calls knuckles the winter soldier i was like like i i i i get the fourth wall breaking stuff but

11:26.160 --> 11:30.800
you can't do too much of it and sonic always did too much of it always um too much for me but

11:30.800 --> 11:39.200
anyway second movie okay it opened with we opened with um robotnik making mushroom coffee after

11:39.200 --> 11:44.800
having been on the planet for a year trying to rebuild he has like a broken spaceship right

11:44.800 --> 11:50.480
yeah he got sent through with the broken machine it's a mech i think it's a mech something i don't

11:50.480 --> 11:54.880
even remember i think no the fight from during the fight in the first movie oh my god it doesn't

11:54.880 --> 11:59.520
matter he had a mech and the mech went through with him yes whatever the fuck he had in the final

11:59.520 --> 12:05.600
act of the first movie with with him anyway he's using the the parts from that to build a giant

12:05.600 --> 12:11.680
antenna to signal space to see who the fuck comes to the mushroom planet yet he had nothing else

12:11.680 --> 12:15.680
he's like i'm just gonna signal and he had like one of sonic's quills which had the like the sonic

12:15.680 --> 12:22.640
power which was he helped him use the energy from the quill to power the the yeah but basically it's

12:23.120 --> 12:28.720
um eggman robot they use both the robot again yeah they use both yeah but he basically he fires

12:28.720 --> 12:35.840
off this this laser and he's hoping someone shows up yeah and knuckle shows up well you have three

12:35.840 --> 12:39.920
randoms who are never explained show up yeah i don't know who the fuck those guys are they're

12:39.920 --> 12:46.000
they look like humans yeah they look like humans with like bird masks yeah but then then robotnik

12:46.000 --> 12:51.760
more or less kills them yeah yeah not graphically he more or less murders them with just traps

12:51.760 --> 12:56.960
goofy traps yeah and then knuckles comes through and he's like oh and then knuckles is just like

12:56.960 --> 13:02.160
he sees the quill and it's just like oh where did you get that and a black man deep black man voice

13:02.160 --> 13:06.640
i can't do i think it is interest elva who's doing this i don't know i can't do that voice i am not a

13:06.640 --> 13:12.480
man you get the quill sort of yeah anyway where do you get the quill and robot takes the like

13:12.480 --> 13:16.800
it's just like i'll just show you the way to earth let's go you know and and so they go

13:16.800 --> 13:23.840
and i can knuckles go off yeah and cut to san francisco yes seattle whatever it starts

13:23.840 --> 13:28.960
with an s and it's in america god damn it okay so what ends up happening is um

13:30.880 --> 13:34.960
those those three are never seen again that's kind of yeah no that's not explained why

13:34.960 --> 13:39.600
no but it's not explained why they're there yeah and then suddenly knuckles comes through the same

13:39.600 --> 13:46.400
portal yeah like it's not it's not explained at all because spoiler alert really early into this

13:46.880 --> 13:51.440
the entire echidna tribe is dead well they always were though yeah i know yeah

13:51.440 --> 13:57.120
he's always the last kid knows the joke oh fuck okay yeah yeah in sonic 3 here's the thing

13:58.800 --> 14:03.760
in sonic 3 he's the last echidna yeah but then when it comes to um they don't explain that they

14:03.760 --> 14:07.440
explain it in sonic adventures which is like the next game with a story because there's a game in

14:07.440 --> 14:12.240

um the temple of the echidnas and it's like overgrown like a big jungle yeah and you see

14:17.280 --> 14:23.200
flashbacks like a bunch of echidnas running around um but anyway the point being what

14:24.000 --> 14:29.840

so that whole thing happens and then they they're going off to uh tom and his wife they're going

16:09.600 --> 16:14.560
off to hawaii for a destination wedding and sonic is like i'll just send you there with one of my

16:14.560 --> 16:19.120
teleportation rings and they go and then like sonic's at home and he has he does he destroys

16:19.120 --> 16:24.080
the house yeah he doesn't he destroys the house he does the thing that like every teenager generally

16:24.080 --> 16:27.680
does when they're left alone for the first time is they just fucking party and sonic just fucking

16:27.680 --> 16:32.400
party by himself he partied by himself yeah well i mean fuck he doesn't like he's an alien like

16:32.400 --> 16:36.960
no no i know but like it was actually with a dog he partnered with the dog but you know what's

16:36.960 --> 16:42.640
weird though is that i feel like that was supposed to be like that pitbull yeah the guy who has no

16:42.640 --> 16:48.560
like friends moments but it wasn't sonic was just having a really good fucking time fucking like he

16:48.560 --> 16:53.840
trashes the house with a bunch of food and then he drives the riding lawnmower through the through

16:53.840 --> 16:59.600
the house to like mulch the food up and spread it across the that was hilarious that was so gross

17:00.560 --> 17:04.240
like imagine just like 18 bags of chips ripped open on the ground and then just like

17:05.120 --> 17:11.040
just drive right through everywhere but anyway to skip over the rest of that and he makes like a

17:11.040 --> 17:17.280
foam room with a pool but anyway and then and then he cleans it up all cleans it all up in like 30

17:17.280 --> 17:21.120
seconds when tom calls from hawaii because he can do that because he facetimes because facetime is

17:21.120 --> 17:26.080
a thing so now you actually have to clean up the room before you answer the phone yeah yes um but

17:26.080 --> 17:31.040
anyway what ends up happening is robotnik comes back yeah robotnik shows up with knuckles and

17:31.040 --> 17:35.280
beats the fuck out of sonic yeah knuckles kicks the shit out of sonic and he's fucking done and

17:35.280 --> 17:39.440
then there's tails tails tails never really explained tails does not explain he they give

17:39.440 --> 17:43.120
him like a couple lines where they explain a little bit but he basically shows up the couple

17:43.120 --> 17:50.400
of lines were hey uh you gave up a shit ton of energy and it got to my home planet and i've been

17:50.400 --> 17:56.800
stalking you you're really cool and i love you and i've been stalking you yeah that's the most

17:56.800 --> 18:02.240
strange this is strange um and sonic isn't even a face he's like you even watched me in the shower

18:02.240 --> 18:09.280
and tails is like that's a trick question sonic prefers bubble baths and sonic isn't phased at all

18:09.280 --> 18:13.840
it's weird okay with it that was weird yeah it was weird it was a weird moment and it's never

18:13.840 --> 18:19.520
dressed ever again but like like tails mentions his village once but like we don't get to know

18:19.520 --> 18:22.160
anything about tails you don't know why you don't really why you showed up it's just like i like you

18:22.160 --> 18:26.960
sonic is like okay i guess no he came to warn sonic about knuckles yes he did but like but

18:26.960 --> 18:31.040
you can't say there's no reason for him okay but it's a shitty reason because yes but it's still a

18:31.040 --> 18:37.600
reason like it's shitty it's not there tails is in the movie because they put tails because they put

18:37.600 --> 18:42.320
tails in the script and no no it's because they put tails in the after credit sequence in the

18:42.320 --> 18:46.560
first movie oh that's why tails is in the movie well yes they had to put them in somehow yeah

18:46.560 --> 18:52.320
and they weren't and here's the thing like sonic one is i think just sonic sonic two like the games

18:52.320 --> 18:57.760
sonic two is sonic and tails versus robotnik and then sonic three they're like how about we try a

18:57.760 --> 19:02.240
story and so they add the floating island and the master emerald and they add um and they add

19:02.240 --> 19:07.920
knuckles who's the guardian and then um robotnik like tricks knuckles and it's the same story in

19:07.920 --> 19:12.880
the movie and then eventually um you get to the point where robotnik flies in and that goes to

19:12.880 --> 19:16.480
steal the master emerald and then knuckles is like oh my god sonic you actually weren't evil

19:16.480 --> 19:21.600
and then knuckles like uh sorry uh robotnik tasers him he tasers uh knuckles oh and then there's like

19:21.600 --> 19:26.080
a big fight with all of them at the end against against um robotnik so so they are basically

19:26.080 --> 19:30.400
they're doing the sonic three story they haven't introduced tails because tails is part of sonic

19:30.400 --> 19:35.360
two so tails just shows up and he's like i've been stalking you let me be your pal and sonic's like

19:35.360 --> 19:43.040
okay and then so they're on they bond in russia yeah it's like it's a kid's movie so they're just

19:43.040 --> 19:48.240
gonna be like okay fine but like yeah it wasn't really set up it was not but anyway so now uh

19:48.240 --> 19:54.480
tails shows up tails rescues him they go on like a little chase they get away not much of a chase

19:54.480 --> 19:57.920
how much of a chase but they get away it's pretty it's pretty much tail shows up hit snuggles with

19:57.920 --> 20:05.680
a car and they escape yep then they go to uh tom's friend's place wade yeah wade it's like his

20:05.680 --> 20:09.920
garage i hate him and like yeah he was just there for like a minute because he was from the first

20:09.920 --> 20:14.240
movie but he was just there for a minute and then he was like he's the deputy he's the deputy sheriff

20:14.240 --> 20:18.160
yeah the town he's an idiot but they go to his place because he was in the first movie he knows

20:18.160 --> 20:22.240
he knows what sonic so he goes there and then sonic's like yeah so in the first movie i got

20:22.240 --> 20:26.640
this map and the map is it turns out the map's the map to the master emerald oh and the master

20:26.640 --> 20:30.320
was hidden on earth yeah and it turns out that for just you know sonic touches the map i guess

20:30.320 --> 20:33.920
for the first time for the first time ever even because as soon as he touches it a big hologram

20:33.920 --> 20:37.520
comes out i was gonna point this out of the owl girl you know listen i was gonna point this out

20:37.520 --> 20:43.520
in the theater but i'm pretty sure we literally saw him touch the map earlier in the movie you

20:43.520 --> 20:48.800
think so i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure he actually opened it up and looked at it in the

20:48.800 --> 20:53.360
earlier part of the movie maybe it's because he touched the part that said master emerald on it

20:53.360 --> 21:00.560
maybe but anyway a coincidence a hologram shows up a hologram shows up of the of the owl of the

21:00.560 --> 21:05.360
owl mom sonic's owl mom and it's like listen listen sonic so if you're reading this if you

21:05.360 --> 21:09.200
if you're hearing this i'm dead master emerald's hidden on earth you gotta go find it find it

21:09.200 --> 21:14.560
there's here's your quest yeah onward and so it's like oh my god this i can finally be a hero

21:14.560 --> 21:18.320
and then so they and wade's like i guess i'm here like wade fucking does nothing

21:18.480 --> 21:25.440
wait wait was annoying that scene would have been better without him yeah but anyway then they go

21:25.440 --> 21:31.600
to russia yeah so they use it turns out that like the coordinates on the map lead to russia russia

21:31.600 --> 21:35.840
and so they go to russia and there's like there's an there's an interlude where they have a dance

21:35.840 --> 21:41.600
off with a bunch of russians they have a dance up like a like a like a dive russian a bar that's

21:41.600 --> 21:46.160
in a really nice building but it's like a dive bar in russia it's in the middle of a snowstorm

21:46.160 --> 21:49.520
in the middle of a snowstorm in the middle of the mountains yeah it's just a dive bar

21:50.080 --> 21:53.840
and there's a dance off because they somehow get a hold of the map they're just through

21:53.840 --> 21:58.640
through shenanigans yeah and they dance us for it and it's like okay so they have a dance off

21:58.640 --> 22:03.600
to summarize it's tales and sonic's bonding moment yeah for the movie it's the bonding moment it's

22:03.600 --> 22:07.600
the bonding moment yeah so they dance they dance off and they get they get the map back but like

22:07.600 --> 22:13.200
there's there's not much to it like it's kind of goofy like they dance yeah because it's a

22:13.200 --> 22:17.920
kids movie you can kind of forgive the fact they go on wild tangents sometimes because uh this

22:17.920 --> 22:21.840
would be not be acceptable in adults but what the fuck is this like yeah it's funny at least it's

22:21.840 --> 22:28.320
funny it's still it's still a fine kids movie um get the map they find a temple in an ice

22:29.760 --> 22:33.520
in the mountains we're assuming in the side of a mountain somewhere they didn't actually show us

22:33.520 --> 22:39.360
how they got into it suddenly they were in the mountain range with the paramount symbol

22:40.320 --> 22:44.720
actually the mount was like the paramount was actually pretty funny and then they're suddenly

22:44.720 --> 22:49.120
in the temple so we're assuming it's in the side of the mountain somewhere so so tails flies holding

22:49.120 --> 22:53.200
sonic you know and in the usual sonic 2 way where he has like his arms they fly into a hole in the

22:53.200 --> 22:56.800
side of a mountain yeah i think i missed that but they fly into a hole in the side of like a big ice

22:56.800 --> 23:01.440
like glacier in a mountain they go in and then okay well i'm still right and they land and then

23:01.440 --> 23:05.040
there's a giant owl door and they're like oh i guess humans never discovered this place before

23:05.040 --> 23:08.400
even though it's like in the russian mountains it's fine well maybe because it's in the Russian

23:08.400 --> 23:14.000
everyone just dies up there okay yeah yeah it's Russia yeah so they go in there um they poke

23:14.000 --> 23:18.560
around the temple they do like the new traps and and puzzles and then Sonic when she finds a compass

23:19.360 --> 23:24.880
and the compass the compass points to the location of the emerald and it's like okay well now we're

23:24.880 --> 23:30.400
one step closer then um yeah then Knuckles and Robotnik catch up and they show they have another

23:30.400 --> 23:37.680
fight everyone gets beaten up everyone gets beaten up but then Sonic decides to escape by using a um

23:38.160 --> 23:41.360
a piece of a mech as a snowboard because he's done that several times in the games so they're

23:41.360 --> 23:45.760
snowboarding down and then Knuckles also does the same thing there's a wave flying in the sky

23:45.760 --> 23:52.160
yeah and snow and Sonic is snowboarding down the mountain while all Robotnik's robots are like

23:52.160 --> 23:56.400
exploding the mountain like beside and behind him there's lots of explosions yeah and then

23:56.400 --> 24:02.000
Knuckles comes and beats him up and then Tails also gets beaten up and Tails becomes unconscious

24:02.000 --> 24:07.120
because he gets hit with rockets yes and then it turns out that um and then both Robotnik and

24:08.240 --> 24:12.400
Knuckles escape with the compass yeah they get away okay hold on I want to tell this part okay

24:12.400 --> 24:19.520
so there's a bit at this point where Sonic's this is like this is the second act of the story

24:19.520 --> 24:24.080
yeah where like Sonic is down and out I want to point out this does not feel like the second act

24:24.080 --> 24:28.480
of the story but it is but it is yeah Sonic's down and out Robotnik and Knuckles are now ahead

24:28.480 --> 24:34.720
in the race to find the master emerald they have the compass and a giant and a giant uh a snow

24:35.600 --> 24:41.200
avalanche a giant giant snowstorm on the mountain a giant avalanche is coming towards

24:41.760 --> 24:46.880
Sonic and the unconscious Tails yeah so Sonic's carrying Tails like this and snowboarding again

24:46.880 --> 24:51.680
yeah and so we're both pretty sure he lost the snowboard he found another one it's fine and

24:52.320 --> 24:56.400
he's like I gotta get the fuck out of here somehow yeah because he lost all of his teleport rings yes

24:56.400 --> 25:00.720
so he calls up Tom Tom who's at who's at Hawaii who's in Hawaii and here's the thing

25:01.280 --> 25:06.400
Tom has one teleport ring to get back from from the trip yeah but he accidentally due to his

25:06.400 --> 25:14.000
shenanigans he mixes it up with the wedding ring yep yeah so Tom is like Sonic calls him

25:14.000 --> 25:17.440
and he's like Sonic's like listen you gotta get I'm gonna fucking die in the middle of the wedding

25:17.440 --> 25:22.640
ceremony yeah and Tom's okay I'll do it and then Tom pulls out the wedding ring and tries to use

25:22.640 --> 25:26.960
it to teleport and doesn't work because it's a wedding ring he's like oh fuck dude so he goes

25:26.960 --> 25:32.240
he runs up to the podium because he got mixed yeah he punches the groom in the face no that's

25:32.240 --> 25:36.240
not right away this is after a bit of back and forth tries to yes this is can I tell this

25:40.000 --> 25:46.400
he punches the groom in the face and then he like he gets the ring and then he throws it

25:46.400 --> 25:52.160
immediately like in front like in front of the wedding of the wedding yeah so the portal opens

25:52.160 --> 25:57.680
up and the entire avalanche comes into the wedding and destroys the wedding not like these

25:57.680 --> 26:03.120
not the entire avalanche enough of the avalanche to destroy the wedding like that was absolutely

26:03.120 --> 26:07.360
fucking hilarious yeah there's some very clever very funny things that happened yeah yeah it was

26:07.360 --> 26:12.320
pretty good yeah it was good but we were both screaming at Tom because we were alone in the

26:12.320 --> 26:15.840
theater because it's such a late movie this kid's movie right there's no one there was dude it was

26:15.840 --> 26:21.200
just us there was no one there it was just you and I and I was like is this even profitable for

26:21.200 --> 26:25.440
these guys that's what they make the money off the popcorn oh yeah we had popcorn fuck

26:25.440 --> 26:30.000
dude popcorn's expensive popcorn's expensive popcorn was always expensive holy shit dude

26:31.120 --> 26:37.200
there's a cab showing up I guess someone else's we just got out yep all right so yeah um once

26:37.200 --> 26:43.040
they get there uh the u.s government it turns out the wedding was actually a sham it was a catfish

26:43.040 --> 26:49.920
operation it was called operation catfish and the the bride's um husband was actually secret agent

26:49.920 --> 26:53.680
and the priest was secret agent and everyone's secret agent everyone was a secret agent and

26:53.680 --> 26:59.840
they're all at the woman it's a woman yeah it's a misogynistic movie guys and they're all working

26:59.840 --> 27:05.040
for gun now name we didn't care no i don't know gun is the guardian unit of nations from sonic

27:05.040 --> 27:10.240
adventure 2 they're the ones that that that did like the whole uh space the space colony

27:10.240 --> 27:15.360
arc and project shadow from sonic adventure 2 like they they have a big place in sonic lore

27:15.360 --> 27:18.720
and so but they made fun of the name immediately like did you call yourself gun really i get

27:18.720 --> 27:24.400
freaking he's like yeah why not but basically uh gun shows up kidnaps sonic entails and also

27:24.400 --> 27:28.320
tom because tom tries to fight them like an idiot tom punches more people in the face because that's

27:28.320 --> 27:31.920
the only thing he's really doing in this movie fucking up and punching people in the face

27:33.440 --> 27:37.600
there's a bit of like a there's like a half action sequence trying to rescue them there's not much

27:37.600 --> 27:44.400
of a one no no no the the action sequence is the two women who were part of the wedding party who

27:44.400 --> 27:50.880
should have been incarcerated with everyone like with the men yeah they just get left to their own

27:50.880 --> 27:56.320
devices so they have tails's technology and they use it to rescue them like by beating up all the

27:56.320 --> 28:00.960
guards yeah they have tails in the backpack here's the thing it's because he i keep saying this they

28:00.960 --> 28:06.240
didn't punch the gun members the way that tom did so they didn't get arrested the guy literally

28:06.240 --> 28:12.160
said this is the last time you're gonna be uh hiding in a bedding an alien you know and then

28:12.240 --> 28:18.000
only takes tom away i don't remember the wife's name you say bedding an alien i don't it's a

28:18.000 --> 28:25.280
bedding not bedding i said a bedding no i i said a bedding i said it with a d oh bedding yeah

28:25.280 --> 28:29.840
okay so anyway there's like a half action sequence that doesn't really go anywhere that where they

28:29.840 --> 28:36.720
rescue they rescue everyone stupid they subdue them misogynistic it was a misogynist it was it

28:36.720 --> 28:47.120
was why wasn't she incarcerated too because i'm just a girl anyway moving on stop thumping the

28:47.120 --> 28:54.720
car you're making the camera move okay actually stop okay you know so what ends up happening

28:55.840 --> 29:00.880
is sonic they're on they're on the shore of hawaii and they see a giant green beam off in the

29:00.880 --> 29:05.520
distance and that's because on a neighboring island the the compass has taken eggman and

29:05.520 --> 29:09.600
knuckles to the location of the master emerald yep and so they put the thing on and there's

29:09.600 --> 29:14.000
a little like a little daze on the beach and they put it in and then like does this giant

29:14.000 --> 29:19.120
uh moses thing where like the sea parts and there's a giant underwater temple yep because

29:19.120 --> 29:23.680
it's under the sea yeah yeah under the sea it's like sure that would have been discovered before

29:23.680 --> 29:28.160
but fine whatever so it's fine they you know what's funny though is that it wasn't even that

29:28.160 --> 29:35.440
far under no it was like 10 feet under yeah it doesn't open that much yeah so the you know um

29:36.400 --> 29:40.560
sonic is like i gotta fucking go over there she goes over there um almost dies almost has no way

29:40.560 --> 29:46.080
but you guys over there and there's like a big sequence under in the temple where there's like

29:46.080 --> 29:52.400
traps and goofiness yes but i i'm still indiana jones for kids i'm complaining because the temple

29:52.400 --> 29:58.400
was dusty and there was roots yep from from plants from plants but it was underwater it was

29:58.400 --> 30:02.480
underwater you know what's actually funny is that there was also plants i think you missed some of

30:02.560 --> 30:06.960
there was also plants in the tunnel in the temple yeah in the tunnel yeah it's like okay but yeah

30:06.960 --> 30:11.280
you know they're they're doing their thing they know their tropes okay fine um and then they get

30:11.280 --> 30:15.440
to the the chamber of the master emerald yep and then sonic comes crashing through the roof

30:15.440 --> 30:20.480
yeah accidentally he's like yeah the chamber somehow there's another sonic and knuckles fight

30:20.480 --> 30:23.840
yep uh which gets interrupted by eggman seeing the emerald because he always was going to

30:23.840 --> 30:28.800
sonic almost dies again yep but sonic rescues knuckles this time knuckles is sad because it

30:28.880 --> 30:33.040
turns out eggman wasn't really his friend yeah they decided to all go and take on um

30:33.040 --> 30:39.120
eggman together yep eggman um he returns to green hills yeah well after letting the emerald like

30:39.120 --> 30:44.160
consume him oh yeah he comes not a different person but he becomes green instead of red

30:44.160 --> 30:47.840
yeah he has like green like lightning bolt powers he's flying around like a god yeah he's doing like

30:47.840 --> 30:55.520
a very god-like things yeah um so god eggman i guess we'll call him i don't know god eggman

30:55.520 --> 31:00.240
works god eggman this is usually where you step in and call him a demigod he always correct me

31:00.240 --> 31:05.600
on those it's god eggman yeah whenever i say he's a god right like oh he's a demigod he said about

31:05.600 --> 31:09.760
sephiroth he said about the dragon spirits and skyward sword what else he said about like he's

31:09.760 --> 31:13.840
a demigod not a god no because okay you know what never mind we'll have this discussion later

31:15.040 --> 31:18.000
my fucking brain is dead from how loud the theater was

31:19.280 --> 31:23.280
our theater's always been this loud i don't know but like when i'm fucking loud when i

31:23.680 --> 31:30.160
myself like a little bit like a week two weeks ago yeah like it was loud like it was just like

31:30.160 --> 31:37.680
in my movie it was quieter it was still really loud yeah so oh by the way just don't go see the

31:37.680 --> 31:42.560
northman it's not that great you want to do a trailer talk in the northman no it's it's not

31:42.560 --> 31:50.960
that great don't go see it okay so what ends up happening guys is they decide to go fight him

31:50.960 --> 31:55.120
together and so tails like this all happens off screen but i think this is what happened

31:55.120 --> 31:59.600
he steals the biplane that was used to fly through the wedding to like to like

32:00.480 --> 32:08.400
rachel slash fiance's name for the number four forever yeah so tails takes the biplane upgrades

32:08.400 --> 32:12.480
it with guns because it's tails and yet he has to he somehow had time to do that he has to have

32:12.480 --> 32:20.080
a biplane yes it's tails it's tails always has a biplane yeah so and then they fly from hawaii

32:20.080 --> 32:24.960
back to what the green hills with a biplane with with the ring that they somehow acquired

32:24.960 --> 32:31.120
did they use the ring they used the ring they used the ring that they somehow acquired even though

32:31.120 --> 32:34.640
son had lost all of this i think knuckles picked them up knuckles picked up all the rings i think

32:34.640 --> 32:39.040
so i don't know because they fell off the cliff no no remember knuckles used a ring to get him

32:39.040 --> 32:45.520
an eggman to the island maybe knuckles picked up his rings like who knows but anyway they have

32:45.520 --> 32:51.200
some rings again whatever they they get back to green hills um and at that point eggman had

32:51.200 --> 32:57.680
returned to green hills because his his uh backup base was that was the mean bean yeah coffee place

32:57.680 --> 33:03.760
yeah and his his henchman is there just like playing playing a bunch of like just doing stuff

33:03.760 --> 33:08.080
and eggman shows up he has like he has no technology anymore because all of his all of

33:08.080 --> 33:11.440
his drones are fucked yeah but then he starts using the powers of the master emerald just to

33:11.440 --> 33:17.360
suck in all the metal in the area so like trains and cars and tanks and stuff this is also yes the

33:17.360 --> 33:22.960
the his base being surrounded by the government yep so he sucks everything all the metal in the

33:22.960 --> 33:28.560
town in into one location yeah and he build and he uses the powers to build a giant mech yeah

33:28.560 --> 33:33.680
and he starts fucking up the town with a giant mech and it's great and then uh sonic tails and

33:33.680 --> 33:39.520
knuckles fly in it on the on the biplane they have their big giant fight it's a this big extended

33:39.520 --> 33:47.440
action sequence um and then it turns out that the master emerald shatters after i think like

33:47.440 --> 33:52.640
knuckles okay okay yeah knuckles punch okay after you know the the huge fight they all they all they

33:52.640 --> 33:56.000
all get defeated by the mech and then you know they all group together and be like we have to

33:56.000 --> 34:02.640
fight him together as a team and then they do and then knuckles punters after sonic distracts

34:02.640 --> 34:08.800
eggman knuckles punches the emerald out of eggman's chest not in a bloody way just

34:09.200 --> 34:15.120
to the chest and emerald comes out the back and then so the mech falls the emerald falls sonic

34:15.120 --> 34:20.720
ends up dragging his half dead body over to it making this a lot more graphic than it actually

34:22.720 --> 34:27.680
so but here's the thing the emerald shatters the emerald the master emerald breaks yes and inside

34:27.680 --> 34:31.440
the master emerald are the seven chaos emeralds yes and i'm just like you have a huge grape

34:31.440 --> 34:35.280
wood i do because the seven chaos emeralds are a different thing than the goddamn master emerald

34:35.360 --> 34:40.720
they are different things but in this movie they're the same thing so the master emerald

34:40.720 --> 34:43.760
breaks it turns out the seven chaos emeralds on the side of it it turns out sonic we already knew

34:43.760 --> 34:48.880
the seven chaos technically inside yeah they mentioned it very early on yeah they got they

34:48.880 --> 34:52.880
got a throwaway line about it yeah um and i was like what the fuck um but then sonic uses the

34:53.520 --> 35:00.000
the the stop shaking the goddamn car jesus sonic uses the um master emerald sorry the chaos emerald

35:00.000 --> 35:05.760
to become supersonic he destroys eggman's mech um eggman somehow gets away of course he does he

35:05.760 --> 35:10.000
didn't they couldn't find his body in the big collapse no no you forgot the most important

35:10.000 --> 35:14.800
part sonic becomes ultimate sonic i said that supersonic oh yeah i didn't hear it you said

35:14.800 --> 35:19.520
ultimate in the theater so i assumed that's what the name was he he uses these i didn't say

35:21.680 --> 35:26.320
he uses the seven chaos emeralds to become supersonic which is the just a super saiyan

35:26.480 --> 35:30.720
super saiyan it's like dragon ball super saiyan but yeah you know what the fuck it is okay so

35:31.520 --> 35:36.400
um everyone but me and then when the power runs out the emeralds scatter because they're

35:36.400 --> 35:41.360
basically dragon balls they scatter um and then they're like well i guess we'll just all live in

35:41.360 --> 35:47.360
green hills now and they do and then actually this is after knuckles somehow fixes the master

35:47.360 --> 35:51.760
emerald with his hands oh he could do that in the games too that's actually fine he just goes

35:51.760 --> 35:55.440
and then it's fine yeah yep and the math but here's the thing he fixes the master emerald

35:55.440 --> 35:58.400
without having seven chaos emeralds in it so it still has some power but it's not the same thing

35:58.400 --> 36:05.760
like i don't know yeah so in in the original continuity um the master emerald kept the

36:05.760 --> 36:10.160
floating island floating yeah and it could also be used to regulate the powers of the seven chaos

36:10.160 --> 36:16.240
emeralds but it was never required to have the master emerald to to become supersonic or to

36:16.240 --> 36:21.440
become no i'm hyper knuckles or any other super forms um jesus christ i fucking remember all this

36:21.440 --> 36:26.880
shit i remember all this shit when i was a kid okay anyway the end of the movie they all live

36:26.880 --> 36:30.480
happily ever after in green hills till the next movie yeah and um including like like tails

36:30.480 --> 36:34.160
knuckles just move in with them i guess they're just all hanging out now they're all kids now oh

36:34.160 --> 36:40.960
and the pivotal emotional moment is when sonic calls tom dad yeah you're my dad and he's like

36:40.960 --> 36:48.160
my son's a freak my son's a fucking alien no it is this is clark kent superman shit this is an

36:48.560 --> 36:52.880
him and his wife are totally fine with it i don't even remember the wife's name

36:52.880 --> 36:57.440
i don't actually think they imagine i'm just surprised that she's black why um because you

36:57.440 --> 37:02.160
don't usually see a white guy with a black girl in like in hollywood yeah but they're trying to

37:02.160 --> 37:08.000
change that now because wokeness yeah which is i i you know what i mean i guess yes okay

37:10.000 --> 37:14.960
non-white guys with white girls that's wokeness white guys with non-white girls that's just based

37:19.120 --> 37:25.440
i'm trolling i'm trolling i swear to god yeah so anyway anyway um the the post credit sequence

37:25.440 --> 37:31.440
is is are the gun guys cleaning up the eggman mess yep and they discover there's a a secret

37:32.160 --> 37:39.600
black site research facility where for 50 years they've been building shadow shadow with a quick

37:39.600 --> 37:45.200
cameo from dr eggman's assistant so we know that dr eggman's definitely alive yeah definitely yeah

37:45.200 --> 37:51.200
um and and here's the thing i said this to you in the in the theater um the story of sonic

37:51.200 --> 37:55.920
adventure 2 which is the shadow story is predicated on sonic adventure 1 yeah because

37:56.560 --> 38:02.560
sonic adventure 1 was was the story of the ancient echidnas and how they had this they fought this um

38:03.120 --> 38:08.320
this primordial this primordial god inside the master emerald called i think it's called chaos

38:08.320 --> 38:14.080
he's like he's like a blue goo man and when he absorbs when he absorbs um emeralds he becomes

38:14.080 --> 38:19.040
stronger and then by the end of the game um there's a giant chaos monster destroying the city

38:19.040 --> 38:22.800
and like millions are dead because it's like flooded and there's like it's fucking awful

38:22.800 --> 38:28.560
and you play super sonic and you and you defeat them i think they just switched it for the owls

38:29.680 --> 38:33.120
yeah but this like if they had actually made sonic adventure the movie that would have been

38:33.120 --> 38:36.640
fucking amazing probably because that game was actually really good it was like it's probably

38:36.640 --> 38:43.280
the best sonic game i think um and then sonic adventure 2 is a direct sequel where the idea

38:43.280 --> 38:51.440
is that robotnik's grandfather was in charge of a satellite um a a space colony called called

38:51.440 --> 38:57.680
space colony arc and they were they were using the knowledge of chaos that the echidnas had

38:57.680 --> 39:03.840
to like they were making like false chaoses to use them as like like weapons um and they but

39:03.840 --> 39:09.760
also at the same time uh they were i think were they trying to clone sonic but basically they

39:09.760 --> 39:15.920
they ended up making shadow as as an experiment with with the emeralds and shadow is just as fast

39:15.920 --> 39:22.080
as sonic he is he's basically what knuckles should have been like you know the coil he's he's just

39:22.080 --> 39:28.640
emo sonic and everyone loves him yes and then he also like falls in love with a human woman

39:28.640 --> 39:37.120
no what happens is um princess nope okay nope so what happens is um this is a robotnik's grandfather

39:37.120 --> 39:42.160
was running the whole project yeah and she he had a daughter and this daughter was growing up

39:42.160 --> 39:47.920
on the space station and she and shadow were friends yep but when they shut the project down

39:47.920 --> 39:52.560
because the chaos creatures went out of control um gun basically went up there and purged everyone

39:52.560 --> 39:57.920
and killed everyone yeah and shadow she like shadow uh was locked away by her i think and so

39:57.920 --> 40:01.280
he was put into a tube for 50 years and she got like all she riddled up with bullets she was

40:01.280 --> 40:06.160
fucking destroyed she was just shot shot the fuck up it was kind of a tragic scene actually um and

40:06.160 --> 40:09.520
then shadow's like you know what i'm just gonna kill all of humanity fuck all of you look what you

40:09.520 --> 40:13.920
fuck you you killed my only friend fuck you that's getting a good villain origin story i'm okay with

40:13.920 --> 40:22.160
that yeah and and what ends up happening is like um in sonic adventure 2 robotnik like turns good

40:22.800 --> 40:26.800
because he's like maybe we should maybe you know okay i mean my grandfather was kind of terrible

40:26.800 --> 40:31.920
because my grandfather after like the grandfather after seeing his daughter died he like he's he

40:31.920 --> 40:35.440
set up a whole bunch of shit that went down 50 years later to try and destroy the world

40:35.440 --> 40:39.840
and robotics like maybe i should stop this so he like helps out robotnik turns good finally

40:39.840 --> 40:43.440
which is not that common in the series actually but he turned good this time oh that's gonna be

40:43.440 --> 40:48.560
weird for them to do that because robotic is like really evil he's really evil he's like he's

40:48.560 --> 40:53.760
significantly more evil than the games like he he's not just like yeah i like was kind of like

40:54.320 --> 40:58.880
uh this not a shitty scientist but i was a misunderstood scientist and now i'm just also

40:58.880 --> 41:05.200
a mad scientist no like he's he's a mad scientist he's he's he's he's chaotic evil

41:06.640 --> 41:10.560
he's actually he's still very funny though he's really goofy like jim carrey does a really good

41:10.560 --> 41:14.640
job yeah i like it a lot he did a great job in the first we did a great job in this movie it's

41:14.640 --> 41:18.240
funny it's really funny when i heard that jim carrey was going to be dr robonic i don't know

41:18.240 --> 41:22.960
that that like to be fair i don't know that much about sonic but from like the little bit i do know

41:22.960 --> 41:28.320
i was like that's gonna be fucking awful like it was actually really good he did such a good job

41:28.320 --> 41:32.000
also because like robotics fat and he's not fat but it's like whatever yeah it doesn't matter

41:32.000 --> 41:35.520
too much yeah it kind of matters but not really like it here's the thing here's the thing they're

41:35.520 --> 41:40.640
still using all like the imagery and everything yeah and and and the thing is if he had done a

41:40.640 --> 41:45.120
bad job i probably matter about the not fat thing but he did such a good job it is such a good job

41:45.120 --> 41:51.440
so there's there's like um there's there's probably the funniest line i think is when

41:51.440 --> 41:56.240
like he's flying around like a god inside of the mech and his assistant who's in like a pilot seat

41:56.240 --> 42:01.360
or like the co-pilot seat is like sir you're magnificent and he's like thank you sycophant

42:03.840 --> 42:11.600
yeah your admiration was inevitable and i was like yes like he just renames his lackey there

42:11.600 --> 42:17.040
yeah to like like he has like all these different names for him you just they're all insulting yeah

42:17.040 --> 42:21.280
and we're pretty sure that the lackey's in love with him but we're not entirely sure

42:21.280 --> 42:26.320
yeah like there's there's a there's a lot of one-way homoeroticism coming from the lackey

42:26.320 --> 42:32.000
towards robotnik yeah and robotic doesn't even care he like he doesn't like abuse him or anything

42:32.000 --> 42:36.480
necessarily but he's like he doesn't even notice that it's happening yeah he doesn't even know

42:36.480 --> 42:42.080
he's a giant fucking narcissist like yeah of course people love him i love me everyone loves me

42:42.080 --> 42:44.160
yeah if you don't i'll just kill you

42:48.880 --> 42:54.960
yeah so it it turns out that they're going to be doing for for the third movie they're going to do

42:54.960 --> 43:00.960
shadow story shadow story from sonic adventure 2 which i think is not gonna work out unless they

43:00.960 --> 43:05.200
somehow do sonic adventure 1 at the same time because this movie kind of did do sonic 2 and 3

43:05.200 --> 43:09.920
and knuckles all at the same time yeah so maybe they could do like they could do like the first

43:09.920 --> 43:14.880
act of the movie is them going to be explaining maybe sonic adventures and then they're going to

43:14.880 --> 43:18.480
move on maybe i don't know because that's how we know that's how it's going to work because they

43:18.480 --> 43:21.920
have like they didn't even explain tails that's how it's going to work yeah i guess they didn't

43:21.920 --> 43:26.400
explain fucking anything if if there is a detriment to this movie it's how little things

43:26.400 --> 43:32.160
are explained but that's because it's a kid's movie yeah and also because it's a movie and

43:32.160 --> 43:37.360
they were going to run out of time yeah yeah they could have done like a tails movie then a knuckles

43:37.360 --> 43:40.080
movie they didn't have them do knuckles in the third and then the second one they can do in the

43:40.080 --> 43:44.480
third one you know they could have figured it out they could have spread out the material to be

43:44.480 --> 43:48.640
honest maybe they were afraid that they like it wouldn't like get trashing because like prequels

43:48.640 --> 43:55.760
generally don't do as well as i wonder how this one's doing sorry sequels don't generally do as

43:55.760 --> 44:00.640
well as the first first movie so i wonder how well this one's gonna do well i guess we'll find out

44:00.640 --> 44:05.200
yeah when all the internet because like it's kind of funny because because this is going out of

44:05.200 --> 44:11.440
theaters this week is this final week yeah yeah that's why i suggested we go yeah yeah so there

44:11.440 --> 44:17.920
is a wider conversation here where like do you recall the backlash against like star wars and

44:17.920 --> 44:26.640
people because they're all terrible yeah including episode seven was okay episodes eight and nine

44:26.640 --> 44:30.320
were both fucking awful yeah and people are like here's a misogynist here's because there's a girl

44:30.960 --> 44:35.120
and it's like no no no no you can have a girl in star wars i don't fucking care

44:35.120 --> 44:38.640
there's leia like who fucking cares no it's because they're bad yeah that's the problem

44:38.640 --> 44:46.160
is that they're they were just bad movies yeah and that was it yep um these aren't bad

44:46.160 --> 44:50.400
oh hold on though okay okay i'm waiting i'm like that what i'm getting to what i'm getting to

44:50.400 --> 44:56.080
is that there has there has this there's this growing feeling of

44:56.320 --> 45:01.520
partial disdain for your own audience in hollywood so so the situation is something like

45:02.160 --> 45:08.080
oh i have this vision for for for star wars and so i'm gonna make the movies that i want to make

45:08.080 --> 45:11.200
and then the audience feedback comes in and they fucking hate it and they're like well fuck you

45:11.200 --> 45:15.680
you're just a misogynist and it's like well maybe or maybe your movie is bad and maybe you should

45:15.680 --> 45:22.160
kind of figure it out yeah now there are a few movies that buck the trend because joker was

45:22.160 --> 45:26.880
beloved and people fucking there was there was like weird progressives or beloved oh isn't it

45:26.880 --> 45:30.800
the same thing i don't think it is okay well in any case you know what i mean there were like

45:30.800 --> 45:36.240
weird progressives when joker came out saying like this is just a this is just a a movie that

45:36.240 --> 45:41.040
lionizes white male rage and it's like shut the fuck up you're so jesus christ you're so stupid

45:41.040 --> 45:48.320
you don't understand anything about anything just fucking eat a bullet okay um in minecraft okay um

45:49.280 --> 45:56.320
in minecraft okay um and then there was sonic because i don't know if you did you see like the

45:56.320 --> 46:00.080
the first leaks of the sonic movie and how fucking awful it looked yeah i did yeah yeah

46:00.080 --> 46:05.280
yeah no i remember that everyone knows about that if you don't know about that you literally don't

46:05.280 --> 46:09.840
have the internet like it was everywhere and people are like what the fuck like this looks

46:09.840 --> 46:14.960
fucking terrible and then the company was like you know what okay we'll fix it yep well fair enough

46:14.960 --> 46:18.560
and then they did right before the movie came out there were people who were saying

46:18.560 --> 46:27.360
do not do not give in to the fans what do they they are entitled spoiled fucking misogynist

46:27.360 --> 46:32.480
you know fucking reactionary brats do not give make the movie that you want to make don't give

46:32.480 --> 46:37.600
them don't do what the fans want you to do and the song the the the uh the whoever made this

46:37.600 --> 46:42.080
movie i don't know who they were they um they said how about we actually do what the fans want

46:42.560 --> 46:47.840
and then the movie came out and it was a hit because it didn't look awful and i remember

46:47.840 --> 46:55.120
that i sonic looked like a terrible stuffed like like what an off-brand stuffed animal

46:55.120 --> 47:01.520
would look like if they had made that as a sonic doll and and and what's what's funny is like

47:02.480 --> 47:07.040
this i think it's partially because the fans finally felt listened to the for the first time

47:07.040 --> 47:11.360
in a while yeah this is like single-handedly revived sonic oh yeah 100 yeah like sonic was

47:11.360 --> 47:14.560
a dead franchise there's no making games they all sucked like sonic forces sucked

47:15.120 --> 47:19.840
um all sonic games are bad you've heard it here first that's not true that's not true

47:19.840 --> 47:23.360
like recent sonic games have not been so good and sonic forces was absolutely fucking terrible

47:23.360 --> 47:29.680
people had basically like sonic ever since like sonic heroes sonic has been known as this fucking

47:29.680 --> 47:35.120
failed franchise and it's been like 20 games since sonic heroes there's been like two good ones

47:35.760 --> 47:41.040
two or three um and then sonic forces come out and it was fucking trash and then people are just

47:41.040 --> 47:45.600
like sonic is just fucking disgusting and then but this this this this movie was i don't know

47:45.600 --> 47:49.840
how much money the first one made but it was so culturally successful that it basically revived

47:49.840 --> 47:54.720
the sonic brand yeah and now we have a second movie and the second movie is it's still good

47:54.720 --> 47:58.800
would you say is as good as the first i actually i would say this time it's about on par with the

47:58.800 --> 48:07.520
first i'm i think i'm gonna say about on par um it like it sequels always tend to be it was a little

48:07.520 --> 48:13.680
less you know some of the emotional moments didn't hit as hard you think so yeah because

48:15.680 --> 48:20.160
because it was about um him tom it was about him and tom bonding and like sonic like

48:20.800 --> 48:26.960
reaching adulthood you know but like coming like coming into his own after being on his own for so

48:26.960 --> 48:32.800
long then in this movie he's still not on his own because he's uh he's like family but like tom just

48:32.800 --> 48:37.280
wanted him to have like more people to hang out with other than just his parents yeah because he

48:37.280 --> 48:41.920
can't go outside like he's a fucking alien yeah exactly yeah so then that that's more or less what

48:41.920 --> 48:48.080
this movie was about but it didn't i feel like it didn't quite touch on that enough slash hard

48:48.080 --> 48:52.960
enough slash hard enough slash hard enough slash hard yeah i couldn't make that into a proper

48:52.960 --> 49:01.680
sentence there you go um so yeah yeah i think it's worth seeing if you like the first one oh

49:01.680 --> 49:05.440
yeah definitely if you like the first one was good if you like the first one uh definitely watch this

49:05.440 --> 49:09.440
one just remember that if you haven't seen the first one well obviously if you want like the

49:09.440 --> 49:14.000
sonic lore to be exact you know it's not gonna be but it's fine it's still a good movie it's still

49:14.000 --> 49:19.200
a good yeah just don't forget that it is specifically for like it's definitely catered to

49:19.200 --> 49:24.000
children yeah yes like if you're a parent and you have like a nine-year-old that likes sonic they're

49:24.000 --> 49:27.120
gonna love the shit out of it oh yeah they're gonna love it and watch it forever and that's

49:27.120 --> 49:30.800
what you're gonna be watching for the next uh month two months about two months maybe three

49:30.880 --> 49:35.280
maybe six maybe six happier maybe maybe until the next sonic movie comes out yeah you know

49:35.280 --> 49:40.800
maybe yeah yeah so since jim carrey's retiring oh no i mean how what are you gonna do for sonic 3

49:42.560 --> 49:46.080
they might get him back for sonic 3 yeah because here's the thing i heard that like

49:46.080 --> 49:49.600
i kept i kept hearing that like jim carrey just wanted out of hollywood because it fucking sucked

49:49.600 --> 49:54.000
yeah but he actually like he liked the robotnik role yeah and he was having fun with it he was

49:54.000 --> 49:59.280
definitely having fun with it like i i didn't feel like he was a little slightly less funny

49:59.280 --> 50:03.760
this time i said that in the theater i felt like it felt slightly less like the because in the

50:03.760 --> 50:08.720
first movie jim carrey was definitely like jim carrying it up you know like he was being jim

50:08.720 --> 50:13.920
care it was just funny this one it was just funny i but it definitely felt like he was kind of like

50:14.960 --> 50:20.400
i want to say holding himself back a little bit for the character to come through a little more

50:20.400 --> 50:25.680
you think so he's definitely still had his like jim carrie isms jim carrie isms jim carrie isms in

50:25.680 --> 50:30.160
it you know it's still really good i'm not saying he wasn't funny it just like it felt like it felt

50:30.160 --> 50:34.720
it felt slightly different from the first movie yeah and then to be honest i don't know if i agree

50:34.720 --> 50:38.320
with you but i still like it i honestly probably have to watch them back to back because it's

50:38.320 --> 50:42.480
actually let's go watch it again no it's been a while since i've seen the first one so i might

50:42.480 --> 50:47.840
be totally wrong to be fair but you know yep so yeah yeah um is there anything else you want to

50:47.840 --> 50:52.560
