0	4400	Hey everyone! Between this video today and the garden video yesterday I bet some people are asking
4400	8480	where's the politics content? Don't worry the politics content hasn't gone anywhere the weekly
8480	13040	sip is still happening tomorrow and there will be new 10 minute take politics videos and other
13040	17920	types of politics videos coming next week. The reason that I'm doing this sort of stuff is well
17920	22080	one I wanted to get out the garden video yesterday because frankly my grandmother is
22720	29280	she's she's in her 90s now and we we don't know when she's going to pass on so I would like her
29280	34000	to see at least some of the garden stuff she absolutely loves those garden videos I don't
34000	39840	want to wait until the end of summer this time to actually put one out I'd rather just do you know
39840	44560	a spring one and a summer one and an autumn one just in case she doesn't she doesn't last
44560	49280	throughout 2022. I know that sounds harsh but you mean you you know what I mean but as for this
49280	55040	video if you go into the backlog of this channel I'm talking way back way before SFO was ever about
55040	60720	politics this is pre-gamergate stuff you'll find at least a few videos I think are still online
60720	68480	of me and Dave doing a series called trailer talk and I think we talked about uh man of steel back
68480	72240	when that was a new movie we talked about star trek into darkness I think we did one about the
72240	78000	hobbit you know this is all you know stuff that was nine or ten years ago and all of those trailer
78000	82080	talks were basically recorded as soon as possible right when we left the theater so we could
82080	86080	actually give like an honest opinion of it we always kind of envisioned a trailer talk to be
86080	91600	the kind of thing where we go to explicitly a very late night screening maybe even like a midnight
91600	97440	show of a movie and then in the darkness of the parking lot or in one case in the darkness of our
97440	102480	backyard we talked about the movie in the middle of the night and it was supposed to be kind of
102480	108000	this quiet private intimate little discussion about movies and the main reason we kind of let
108000	114480	that series die around 2014 is because none of us had a car anymore to go to the movie theater
114480	120720	but now that we have a car and now that covid is no more I do want to revive the trailer talk series
120720	125440	I'm not going to revive it on SFO this is still a politics channel I'm uploading the first new one
125440	130080	right here just to let you know and any future trailer talks are going to appear over on the
130080	135120	dev kit channel the dev kit channel is basically my personal channel where I do tech stuff I do
135120	141280	unboxings I do reviews I do trailer talks now basically anything that's not politics and that
141280	146560	isn't part of the game boomers you know let's play thing I'm gonna put up on dev kit it is a channel
146560	151360	that is mainly my personal channel and not necessarily you know SFO the brand but nonetheless
151360	155520	I would still appreciate it if you decided to follow it and keep up with what I'm doing there
155520	159920	because I know that Naomi likes going to movies so whenever we go to a movie maybe we'll shoot
159920	163760	a trailer talk who knows but anyway I'm putting the first one up here just to let you know hope
163760	168400	you enjoy it and if you want to see any more please head over to dev kit thank you very much
168400	172720	guys new politics content coming after this I really appreciate you sticking around I'll see
172720	179120	you next time I love you so we're back at this it's been about 10 years since we've actually done
179120	187760	this this show on the channel 10 years years so for those of you who have been watching long
187760	192400	before the politics stuff long before gamergate Dave and I did a show on this channel we have
192480	197760	a half a dozen episodes or so called trailer talk but what we would do is you would go see
197760	205120	a really late screening of a movie yeah really late and then it's like past past midnight right
205120	211920	now yes yeah and then talk about it like basically the night of I forgot I already had some water
211920	217280	here I'm so I had so much popcorn dude I'm gonna float away why why would you float away because I
217280	226160	feel bloated but wouldn't you just sink instead of floating maybe but anyway we want today
226160	231040	tonight we went out to the old cinema and now it's like 1am or whatever and we had we watched
231040	236480	sonic the hedgehog 2 2 second one okay what the fuck's happening with this thing oh for the love
236480	247840	of god I will open it will you yeah let's see will you yep yeah yep keep talking hold on I
247840	251760	want to see this first free time before we talk about any fucking movie I want to see this shit
252960	256960	will you open it maybe not this is more than the fucking movie was
258720	263120	oh the movie wasn't that bad no it wasn't actually but this is for some reason I'm not opening
264080	273440	well anyway so we saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2 now we also watched Sonic the Hedgehog 1 that came out
273440	278080	like during the pandemic didn't it I don't remember that was eons ago was it it was the
278080	284160	reason we're doing it the night of is because I'll forget yeah I'll forget all my opinions
284160	290080	my tomorrow even though technically it is tomorrow we watched Sonic 1 and how did we both feel about
290080	296400	Sonic 1 we both liked Sonic 1 but it was very obviously a kids movie well yeah and so was this
296400	302080	one well yeah but like like I mean like you can't go into it expecting it to be like like a good
302080	307280	kids movie you know what I mean why not well no no okay no no I mean like a good drink good well
307280	313760	you explained this a good kids movie for adults you know like yes there's references to the actual
313760	319840	Sonic games and the movie but you have to expect going in that yes it's very simplified like there's
319840	326160	lots of funny goofy moments there's no swearing as it's for children specifically it's not for
326160	331760	like teenagers kind of edging on the adults so adults can kind of enjoy it too no it's for kids
331760	336880	yes definitely for children but this look good but you have to make sure that you know that
336880	341760	they're for kids going into it yeah so the first Sonic was
342720	343200	possible
346640	353840	this is all staying in the family no have the water have the water I'm gonna okay so the first
353840	359840	Sonic um Sonic likes to do this thing whenever they do like a like a I wouldn't say movie but
359840	369680	a show or anything else what Sonic likes to do is they like to um basically throw in human characters
370080	376320	and they always do like a Sonic comes to the human world situation happens it was Sonic X
376960	380800	they did it with I think one of the comics they did it with a lot of Sonic properties
381680	386960	because like the actual story of Sonic is Sonic lives in a world where at least the original
386960	391760	Sonics like we're talking like Sonic one two and three and Sonic and Knuckles and um there's there
391760	401760	was a bunch of situations where basically Sonic was fighting Robotnik and there's not much story
401760	407600	to it and there's animal friends and there's there's magic and like Robotnik being the only
407600	411200	human doesn't make any sense but you know what fuck it's it's a video game you know it was made
411200	415520	it was made back in the 90s okay listen no no didn't you say that a premise to the Sonic game
415520	419280	specifically was that they were all mutated animals that was later they added that to try
419280	423120	and explain the original oh wait okay so since since they were trying to explain the original
423120	426800	obviously Robotnik was the only human survivor because he was the only one smart enough to
426800	431440	survive he wasn't it was actually a lot of humans just we don't see them until Sonic Adventure but
431440	436960	yeah never mind basically like the idea from what I understand the whole Mobius which was the planet
436960	441840	that they were all on was actually a far future earth where you have nuclear war and mutated
441840	445440	animals and they're still humans that's why in Sonic Adventure there's like a city with humans
445440	449440	and like a station square there's still a bunch of humans hanging around but there's also animals
449440	454160	too and people are just okay with it because they've gotten used to it and the level of
454160	458800	technology is like equivalent to like 90s earth because they've gotten back to that point but
458800	463600	there's just a bunch of furries running around and so that was like the small furries that was
463600	469440	the deep lore but of course they do for example in Sonic X it was that there was like an alternate
469440	472640	universe there's always alternate universes there's a sonic universe and then there's the
473600	478320	and there's like the human universe and there's always like Sonic gets iskaid over into the human
478320	482960	universe and that's like it's iskaid I thought it was isekaid what a wrong fucking guy
487120	492160	and that is what Sonic 1 ended up being it ended up being exactly what if you were going to do what
492160	496720	every other time you've done Sonic yes they they they did a thing where you know he goes to the
496720	501920	United States he goes to Green Hill the town called Green Hills and like is it Montana I don't
501920	508240	know in the middle middle of trees in the middle of trees that's where it was yep for the rich
508240	512960	people hosts yeah was there any reason for that opening bit in Sonic 2 to be set in Seattle I
512960	518480	don't think so never came back to being in Seattle well no it was to set up the fact that Sonic still
518480	523920	wanted to be a hero but why Seattle like the first movie why Seattle probably because it was semi
523920	529760	close by okay maybe well or he heard that the crime was happening right that second in this
529760	534880	iteration of the story Sonic is from another planet there's rings that the actual rings in
534880	538080	the games they're they're basically teleportation devices you can open portals to go wherever you
538080	541760	want to go they don't really explain it too hard because they're just having a good time
542320	548160	and what ends up happening is Sonic he escaped he's on a planet with an owl mother which is like
548160	554000	a new creation of this game and the Enkidna tribe is coming to kick the shit out of her to try and
554000	557680	get the master mode you'll find out about the first movie but in the first movie he goes to
557680	562800	he escapes he goes to earth he's raised by himself himself for a bit and then eventually
562800	568080	this dude who finds him what was his name again he's so forgettable tom tom he's so forgettable
568080	575360	he doesn't tom tom chowski whichowski or something he he had more of a thing he had more of a part in
575360	583680	the first movie oh yeah no like okay tom guy tom guy he was in the second movie I don't remember
583680	589600	that he was in the second movie and we're just watching okay real quickly first movie he ends
589600	595440	up with tom robotnik is a defense contractor with the us government initially he's making drones and
595440	602800	stuff he's doing his thing um and he ends up he the government wants him to fight sonic because
602800	607760	he's an alien yes something like that but then he also ends he ends up taking the loss personally
607760	612480	and so they had like this giant fight throughout the first movie they fight in san francisco well
612800	617680	i'm just quickly getting through okay okay fine go and then by the end by the end of it um sonic
617680	622720	tricks robotnik into going through a ring yeah and he ends up on a mushroom planet there's literally
622720	626960	nothing about mushrooms it's only mushrooms mushrooms and rock yeah and there's there's a lot
626960	632000	of uh really fun references in both movies actually the second movie had uh uh the um
632800	636640	it's a coffee place called the mean bean which is obviously a reference to dr robotnik's mean
636640	642720	bean machine i don't know what that is but i don't know but nail me are you fucking kidding
642720	651520	the references okay but anyway yeah we're references yes but anyway anyway the point being
651520	655280	is that uh that's the first movie the first movie was actually it was a pretty solid kids movie
655280	659760	it was a bit cringy at times but it was still as all kids as all kids movies yes like you could do
659760	666160	a lot worse with a kid's movie yeah it wasn't stupid no it wasn't um it was a bit too self-referential
666240	669600	it's always this one they both like had too many like breaking jokes
671280	678560	just that like the time when they're going down the um the uh the mountain and sonic
678560	686160	calls knuckles the winter soldier i was like like i i i i get the fourth wall breaking stuff but
686160	690800	you can't do too much of it and sonic always did too much of it always um too much for me but
690800	699200	anyway second movie okay it opened with we opened with um robotnik making mushroom coffee after
699200	704800	having been on the planet for a year trying to rebuild he has like a broken spaceship right
704800	710480	yeah he got sent through with the broken machine it's a mech i think it's a mech something i don't
710480	714880	even remember i think no the fight from during the fight in the first movie oh my god it doesn't
714880	719520	matter he had a mech and the mech went through with him yes whatever the fuck he had in the final
719520	725600	act of the first movie with with him anyway he's using the the parts from that to build a giant
725600	731680	antenna to signal space to see who the fuck comes to the mushroom planet yet he had nothing else
731680	735680	he's like i'm just gonna signal and he had like one of sonic's quills which had the like the sonic
735680	742640	power which was he helped him use the energy from the quill to power the the yeah but basically it's
743120	748720	um eggman robot they use both the robot again yeah they use both yeah but he basically he fires
748720	755840	off this this laser and he's hoping someone shows up yeah and knuckle shows up well you have three
755840	759920	randoms who are never explained show up yeah i don't know who the fuck those guys are they're
759920	766000	they look like humans yeah they look like humans with like bird masks yeah but then then robotnik
766000	771760	more or less kills them yeah yeah not graphically he more or less murders them with just traps
771760	776960	goofy traps yeah and then knuckles comes through and he's like oh and then knuckles is just like
776960	782160	he sees the quill and it's just like oh where did you get that and a black man deep black man voice
782160	786640	i can't do i think it is interest elva who's doing this i don't know i can't do that voice i am not a
786640	792480	man you get the quill sort of yeah anyway where do you get the quill and robot takes the like
792480	796800	it's just like i'll just show you the way to earth let's go you know and and so they go
796800	803840	and i can knuckles go off yeah and cut to san francisco yes seattle whatever it starts
803840	808960	with an s and it's in america god damn it okay so what ends up happening is um
810880	814960	those those three are never seen again that's kind of yeah no that's not explained why
814960	819600	no but it's not explained why they're there yeah and then suddenly knuckles comes through the same
819600	826400	portal yeah like it's not it's not explained at all because spoiler alert really early into this
826880	831440	the entire echidna tribe is dead well they always were though yeah i know yeah
831440	837120	he's always the last kid knows the joke oh fuck okay yeah yeah in sonic 3 here's the thing
838800	843760	in sonic 3 he's the last echidna yeah but then when it comes to um they don't explain that they
843760	847440	explain it in sonic adventures which is like the next game with a story because there's a game in
847440	852240	between like just yes yes there's no story but like in sonic adventure there's like you go to the the
852240	857280	um the temple of the echidnas and it's like overgrown like a big jungle yeah and you see
857280	863200	flashbacks like a bunch of echidnas running around um but anyway the point being what
864000	869840	anyway the point being yeah the point being is that in this movie um sonic's running around
869840	876080	seattle and he's like massively fucking up stopping a robbery of a armored car he destroys
876080	880800	an entire city block trying to stop an armored car and almost kills many civilians many times
880880	883840	and there's like and he's trying to do like the batman thing and they're like cleaning it up
883840	889520	and he's like he's also like justice yeah he's wise cracking a whole bunch yeah like spider-man
889520	893200	except worse yeah yeah but he's trying to be batman but he's more spider-man yeah and then
893200	898000	he like he fucks everything up and he like a bunch of people get hurt but no no no no one got hurt
898000	903520	but he almost killed many people no one can get hurt as a pg movie yeah many people almost got
903520	907440	killed no one actually got killed and a lot of things destroyed an entire city block a lot of
907840	912880	entire city block and then he goes i saved you and they're all like fuck you sonic you know the
912880	918480	tight-up guard was like you're a terrible hero yeah and like sonic not even faze runs home to
918480	923520	green hills or yeah of course it's green hills it was first i don't know are you fucking kidding
923520	928880	me i don't fucking know so okay so he runs home to green hills uh by the next day and he's like
928880	933600	trying to pretend that he's um he was like asleep all night yep he's doing the bruce wayne thing
933600	940160	got caught by and then like his dad i guess um tom is like listen you can't you can't you're
940160	943840	don't be reckless don't be reckless because you're still a kid and yeah sonic's at 16.
943840	951120	sonic was always a kid yeah as long as a kid so he's ariel's age so sonic's a kid who little
951120	955760	mermaid fuck you who wanted to go off into her own thing which was 14 i'm pretty sure
955760	962560	i'm pretty sure in the disney movie she's 16 okay well anyway anyway anyway um
963760	969600	so that whole thing happens and then they they're going off to uh tom and his wife they're going
969600	974560	off to hawaii for a destination wedding and sonic is like i'll just send you there with one of my
974560	979120	teleportation rings and they go and then like sonic's at home and he has he does he destroys
979120	984080	the house yeah he doesn't he destroys the house he does the thing that like every teenager generally
984080	987680	does when they're left alone for the first time is they just fucking party and sonic just fucking
987680	992400	party by himself he partied by himself yeah well i mean fuck he doesn't like he's an alien like
992400	996960	no no i know but like it was actually with a dog he partnered with the dog but you know what's
996960	1002640	weird though is that i feel like that was supposed to be like that pitbull yeah the guy who has no
1002640	1008560	like friends moments but it wasn't sonic was just having a really good fucking time fucking like he
1008560	1013840	trashes the house with a bunch of food and then he drives the riding lawnmower through the through
1013840	1019600	the house to like mulch the food up and spread it across the that was hilarious that was so gross
1020560	1024240	like imagine just like 18 bags of chips ripped open on the ground and then just like
1025120	1031040	just drive right through everywhere but anyway to skip over the rest of that and he makes like a
1031040	1037280	foam room with a pool but anyway and then and then he cleans it up all cleans it all up in like 30
1037280	1041120	seconds when tom calls from hawaii because he can do that because he facetimes because facetime is
1041120	1046080	a thing so now you actually have to clean up the room before you answer the phone yeah yes um but
1046080	1051040	anyway what ends up happening is robotnik comes back yeah robotnik shows up with knuckles and
1051040	1055280	beats the fuck out of sonic yeah knuckles kicks the shit out of sonic and he's fucking done and
1055280	1059440	then there's tails tails tails never really explained tails does not explain he they give
1059440	1063120	him like a couple lines where they explain a little bit but he basically shows up the couple
1063120	1070400	of lines were hey uh you gave up a shit ton of energy and it got to my home planet and i've been
1070400	1076800	stalking you you're really cool and i love you and i've been stalking you yeah that's the most
1076800	1082240	strange this is strange um and sonic isn't even a face he's like you even watched me in the shower
1082240	1089280	and tails is like that's a trick question sonic prefers bubble baths and sonic isn't phased at all
1089280	1093840	it's weird okay with it that was weird yeah it was weird it was a weird moment and it's never
1093840	1099520	dressed ever again but like like tails mentions his village once but like we don't get to know
1099520	1102160	anything about tails you don't know why you don't really why you showed up it's just like i like you
1102160	1106960	sonic is like okay i guess no he came to warn sonic about knuckles yes he did but like but
1106960	1111040	you can't say there's no reason for him okay but it's a shitty reason because yes but it's still a
1111040	1117600	reason like it's shitty it's not there tails is in the movie because they put tails because they put
1117600	1122320	tails in the script and no no it's because they put tails in the after credit sequence in the
1122320	1126560	first movie oh that's why tails is in the movie well yes they had to put them in somehow yeah
1126560	1132320	and they weren't and here's the thing like sonic one is i think just sonic sonic two like the games
1132320	1137760	sonic two is sonic and tails versus robotnik and then sonic three they're like how about we try a
1137760	1142240	story and so they add the floating island and the master emerald and they add um and they add
1142240	1147920	knuckles who's the guardian and then um robotnik like tricks knuckles and it's the same story in
1147920	1152880	the movie and then eventually um you get to the point where robotnik flies in and that goes to
1152880	1156480	steal the master emerald and then knuckles is like oh my god sonic you actually weren't evil
1156480	1161600	and then knuckles like uh sorry uh robotnik tasers him he tasers uh knuckles oh and then there's like
1161600	1166080	a big fight with all of them at the end against against um robotnik so so they are basically
1166080	1170400	they're doing the sonic three story they haven't introduced tails because tails is part of sonic
1170400	1175360	two so tails just shows up and he's like i've been stalking you let me be your pal and sonic's like
1175360	1183040	okay and then so they're on they bond in russia yeah it's like it's a kid's movie so they're just
1183040	1188240	gonna be like okay fine but like yeah it wasn't really set up it was not but anyway so now uh
1188240	1194480	tails shows up tails rescues him they go on like a little chase they get away not much of a chase
1194480	1197920	how much of a chase but they get away it's pretty it's pretty much tail shows up hit snuggles with
1197920	1205680	a car and they escape yep then they go to uh tom's friend's place wade yeah wade it's like his
1205680	1209920	garage i hate him and like yeah he was just there for like a minute because he was from the first
1209920	1214240	movie but he was just there for a minute and then he was like he's the deputy he's the deputy sheriff
1214240	1218160	yeah the town he's an idiot but they go to his place because he was in the first movie he knows
1218160	1222240	he knows what sonic so he goes there and then sonic's like yeah so in the first movie i got
1222240	1226640	this map and the map is it turns out the map's the map to the master emerald oh and the master
1226640	1230320	was hidden on earth yeah and it turns out that for just you know sonic touches the map i guess
1230320	1233920	for the first time for the first time ever even because as soon as he touches it a big hologram
1233920	1237520	comes out i was gonna point this out of the owl girl you know listen i was gonna point this out
1237520	1243520	in the theater but i'm pretty sure we literally saw him touch the map earlier in the movie you
1243520	1248800	think so i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure he actually opened it up and looked at it in the
1248800	1253360	earlier part of the movie maybe it's because he touched the part that said master emerald on it
1253360	1260560	maybe but anyway a coincidence a hologram shows up a hologram shows up of the of the owl of the
1260560	1265360	owl mom sonic's owl mom and it's like listen listen sonic so if you're reading this if you
1265360	1269200	if you're hearing this i'm dead master emerald's hidden on earth you gotta go find it find it
1269200	1274560	there's here's your quest yeah onward and so it's like oh my god this i can finally be a hero
1274560	1278320	and then so they and wade's like i guess i'm here like wade fucking does nothing
1278480	1285440	wait wait was annoying that scene would have been better without him yeah but anyway then they go
1285440	1291600	to russia yeah so they use it turns out that like the coordinates on the map lead to russia russia
1291600	1295840	and so they go to russia and there's like there's an there's an interlude where they have a dance
1295840	1301600	off with a bunch of russians they have a dance up like a like a like a dive russian a bar that's
1301600	1306160	in a really nice building but it's like a dive bar in russia it's in the middle of a snowstorm
1306160	1309520	in the middle of a snowstorm in the middle of the mountains yeah it's just a dive bar
1310080	1313840	and there's a dance off because they somehow get a hold of the map they're just through
1313840	1318640	through shenanigans yeah and they dance us for it and it's like okay so they have a dance off
1318640	1323600	to summarize it's tales and sonic's bonding moment yeah for the movie it's the bonding moment it's
1323600	1327600	the bonding moment yeah so they dance they dance off and they get they get the map back but like
1327600	1333200	there's there's not much to it like it's kind of goofy like they dance yeah because it's a
1333200	1337920	kids movie you can kind of forgive the fact they go on wild tangents sometimes because uh this
1337920	1341840	would be not be acceptable in adults but what the fuck is this like yeah it's funny at least it's
1341840	1348320	funny it's still it's still a fine kids movie um get the map they find a temple in an ice
1349760	1353520	in the mountains we're assuming in the side of a mountain somewhere they didn't actually show us
1353520	1359360	how they got into it suddenly they were in the mountain range with the paramount symbol
1360320	1364720	actually the mount was like the paramount was actually pretty funny and then they're suddenly
1364720	1369120	in the temple so we're assuming it's in the side of the mountain somewhere so so tails flies holding
1369120	1373200	sonic you know and in the usual sonic 2 way where he has like his arms they fly into a hole in the
1373200	1376800	side of a mountain yeah i think i missed that but they fly into a hole in the side of like a big ice
1376800	1381440	like glacier in a mountain they go in and then okay well i'm still right and they land and then
1381440	1385040	there's a giant owl door and they're like oh i guess humans never discovered this place before
1385040	1388400	even though it's like in the russian mountains it's fine well maybe because it's in the Russian
1388400	1394000	everyone just dies up there okay yeah yeah it's Russia yeah so they go in there um they poke
1394000	1398560	around the temple they do like the new traps and and puzzles and then Sonic when she finds a compass
1399360	1404880	and the compass the compass points to the location of the emerald and it's like okay well now we're
1404880	1410400	one step closer then um yeah then Knuckles and Robotnik catch up and they show they have another
1410400	1417680	fight everyone gets beaten up everyone gets beaten up but then Sonic decides to escape by using a um
1418160	1421360	a piece of a mech as a snowboard because he's done that several times in the games so they're
1421360	1425760	snowboarding down and then Knuckles also does the same thing there's a wave flying in the sky
1425760	1432160	yeah and snow and Sonic is snowboarding down the mountain while all Robotnik's robots are like
1432160	1436400	exploding the mountain like beside and behind him there's lots of explosions yeah and then
1436400	1442000	Knuckles comes and beats him up and then Tails also gets beaten up and Tails becomes unconscious
1442000	1447120	because he gets hit with rockets yes and then it turns out that um and then both Robotnik and
1448240	1452400	Knuckles escape with the compass yeah they get away okay hold on I want to tell this part okay
1452400	1459520	so there's a bit at this point where Sonic's this is like this is the second act of the story
1459520	1464080	yeah where like Sonic is down and out I want to point out this does not feel like the second act
1464080	1468480	of the story but it is but it is yeah Sonic's down and out Robotnik and Knuckles are now ahead
1468480	1474720	in the race to find the master emerald they have the compass and a giant and a giant uh a snow
1475600	1481200	avalanche a giant giant snowstorm on the mountain a giant avalanche is coming towards
1481760	1486880	Sonic and the unconscious Tails yeah so Sonic's carrying Tails like this and snowboarding again
1486880	1491680	yeah and so we're both pretty sure he lost the snowboard he found another one it's fine and
1492320	1496400	he's like I gotta get the fuck out of here somehow yeah because he lost all of his teleport rings yes
1496400	1500720	so he calls up Tom Tom who's at who's at Hawaii who's in Hawaii and here's the thing
1501280	1506400	Tom has one teleport ring to get back from from the trip yeah but he accidentally due to his
1506400	1514000	shenanigans he mixes it up with the wedding ring yep yeah so Tom is like Sonic calls him
1514000	1517440	and he's like Sonic's like listen you gotta get I'm gonna fucking die in the middle of the wedding
1517440	1522640	ceremony yeah and Tom's okay I'll do it and then Tom pulls out the wedding ring and tries to use
1522640	1526960	it to teleport and doesn't work because it's a wedding ring he's like oh fuck dude so he goes
1526960	1532240	he runs up to the podium because he got mixed yeah he punches the groom in the face no that's
1532240	1536240	not right away this is after a bit of back and forth tries to yes this is can I tell this
1540000	1546400	he punches the groom in the face and then he like he gets the ring and then he throws it
1546400	1552160	immediately like in front like in front of the wedding of the wedding yeah so the portal opens
1552160	1557680	up and the entire avalanche comes into the wedding and destroys the wedding not like these
1557680	1563120	not the entire avalanche enough of the avalanche to destroy the wedding like that was absolutely
1563120	1567360	fucking hilarious yeah there's some very clever very funny things that happened yeah yeah it was
1567360	1572320	pretty good yeah it was good but we were both screaming at Tom because we were alone in the
1572320	1575840	theater because it's such a late movie this kid's movie right there's no one there was dude it was
1575840	1581200	just us there was no one there it was just you and I and I was like is this even profitable for
1581200	1585440	these guys that's what they make the money off the popcorn oh yeah we had popcorn fuck
1585440	1590000	dude popcorn's expensive popcorn's expensive popcorn was always expensive holy shit dude
1591120	1597200	there's a cab showing up I guess someone else's we just got out yep all right so yeah um once
1597200	1603040	they get there uh the u.s government it turns out the wedding was actually a sham it was a catfish
1603040	1609920	operation it was called operation catfish and the the bride's um husband was actually secret agent
1609920	1613680	and the priest was secret agent and everyone's secret agent everyone was a secret agent and
1613680	1619840	they're all at the woman it's a woman yeah it's a misogynistic movie guys and they're all working
1619840	1625040	for gun now name we didn't care no i don't know gun is the guardian unit of nations from sonic
1625040	1630240	adventure 2 they're the ones that that that did like the whole uh space the space colony
1630240	1635360	arc and project shadow from sonic adventure 2 like they they have a big place in sonic lore
1635360	1638720	and so but they made fun of the name immediately like did you call yourself gun really i get
1638720	1644400	freaking he's like yeah why not but basically uh gun shows up kidnaps sonic entails and also
1644400	1648320	tom because tom tries to fight them like an idiot tom punches more people in the face because that's
1648320	1651920	the only thing he's really doing in this movie fucking up and punching people in the face
1653440	1657600	there's a bit of like a there's like a half action sequence trying to rescue them there's not much
1657600	1664400	of a one no no no the the action sequence is the two women who were part of the wedding party who
1664400	1670880	should have been incarcerated with everyone like with the men yeah they just get left to their own
1670880	1676320	devices so they have tails's technology and they use it to rescue them like by beating up all the
1676320	1680960	guards yeah they have tails in the backpack here's the thing it's because he i keep saying this they
1680960	1686240	didn't punch the gun members the way that tom did so they didn't get arrested the guy literally
1686240	1692160	said this is the last time you're gonna be uh hiding in a bedding an alien you know and then
1692240	1698000	only takes tom away i don't remember the wife's name you say bedding an alien i don't it's a
1698000	1705280	bedding not bedding i said a bedding no i i said a bedding i said it with a d oh bedding yeah
1705280	1709840	okay so anyway there's like a half action sequence that doesn't really go anywhere that where they
1709840	1716720	rescue they rescue everyone stupid they subdue them misogynistic it was a misogynist it was it
1716720	1727120	was why wasn't she incarcerated too because i'm just a girl anyway moving on stop thumping the
1727120	1734720	car you're making the camera move okay actually stop okay you know so what ends up happening
1735840	1740880	is sonic they're on they're on the shore of hawaii and they see a giant green beam off in the
1740880	1745520	distance and that's because on a neighboring island the the compass has taken eggman and
1745520	1749600	knuckles to the location of the master emerald yep and so they put the thing on and there's
1749600	1754000	a little like a little daze on the beach and they put it in and then like does this giant
1754000	1759120	uh moses thing where like the sea parts and there's a giant underwater temple yep because
1759120	1763680	it's under the sea yeah yeah under the sea it's like sure that would have been discovered before
1763680	1768160	but fine whatever so it's fine they you know what's funny though is that it wasn't even that
1768160	1775440	far under no it was like 10 feet under yeah it doesn't open that much yeah so the you know um
1776400	1780560	sonic is like i gotta fucking go over there she goes over there um almost dies almost has no way
1780560	1786080	but you guys over there and there's like a big sequence under in the temple where there's like
1786080	1792400	traps and goofiness yes but i i'm still indiana jones for kids i'm complaining because the temple
1792400	1798400	was dusty and there was roots yep from from plants from plants but it was underwater it was
1798400	1802480	underwater you know what's actually funny is that there was also plants i think you missed some of
1802560	1806960	there was also plants in the tunnel in the temple yeah in the tunnel yeah it's like okay but yeah
1806960	1811280	you know they're they're doing their thing they know their tropes okay fine um and then they get
1811280	1815440	to the the chamber of the master emerald yep and then sonic comes crashing through the roof
1815440	1820480	yeah accidentally he's like yeah the chamber somehow there's another sonic and knuckles fight
1820480	1823840	yep uh which gets interrupted by eggman seeing the emerald because he always was going to
1823840	1828800	sonic almost dies again yep but sonic rescues knuckles this time knuckles is sad because it
1828880	1833040	turns out eggman wasn't really his friend yeah they decided to all go and take on um
1833040	1839120	eggman together yep eggman um he returns to green hills yeah well after letting the emerald like
1839120	1844160	consume him oh yeah he comes not a different person but he becomes green instead of red
1844160	1847840	yeah he has like green like lightning bolt powers he's flying around like a god yeah he's doing like
1847840	1855520	a very god-like things yeah um so god eggman i guess we'll call him i don't know god eggman
1855520	1860240	works god eggman this is usually where you step in and call him a demigod he always correct me
1860240	1865600	on those it's god eggman yeah whenever i say he's a god right like oh he's a demigod he said about
1865600	1869760	sephiroth he said about the dragon spirits and skyward sword what else he said about like he's
1869760	1873840	a demigod not a god no because okay you know what never mind we'll have this discussion later
1875040	1878000	my fucking brain is dead from how loud the theater was
1879280	1883280	our theater's always been this loud i don't know but like when i'm fucking loud when i
1883680	1890160	myself like a little bit like a week two weeks ago yeah like it was loud like it was just like
1890160	1897680	in my movie it was quieter it was still really loud yeah so oh by the way just don't go see the
1897680	1902560	northman it's not that great you want to do a trailer talk in the northman no it's it's not
1902560	1910960	that great don't go see it okay so what ends up happening guys is they decide to go fight him
1910960	1915120	together and so tails like this all happens off screen but i think this is what happened
1915120	1919600	he steals the biplane that was used to fly through the wedding to like to like
1920480	1928400	rachel slash fiance's name for the number four forever yeah so tails takes the biplane upgrades
1928400	1932480	it with guns because it's tails and yet he has to he somehow had time to do that he has to have
1932480	1940080	a biplane yes it's tails it's tails always has a biplane yeah so and then they fly from hawaii
1940080	1944960	back to what the green hills with a biplane with with the ring that they somehow acquired
1944960	1951120	did they use the ring they used the ring they used the ring that they somehow acquired even though
1951120	1954640	son had lost all of this i think knuckles picked them up knuckles picked up all the rings i think
1954640	1959040	so i don't know because they fell off the cliff no no remember knuckles used a ring to get him
1959040	1965520	an eggman to the island maybe knuckles picked up his rings like who knows but anyway they have
1965520	1971200	some rings again whatever they they get back to green hills um and at that point eggman had
1971200	1977680	returned to green hills because his his uh backup base was that was the mean bean yeah coffee place
1977680	1983760	yeah and his his henchman is there just like playing playing a bunch of like just doing stuff
1983760	1988080	and eggman shows up he has like he has no technology anymore because all of his all of
1988080	1991440	his drones are fucked yeah but then he starts using the powers of the master emerald just to
1991440	1997360	suck in all the metal in the area so like trains and cars and tanks and stuff this is also yes the
1997360	2002960	the his base being surrounded by the government yep so he sucks everything all the metal in the
2002960	2008560	town in into one location yeah and he build and he uses the powers to build a giant mech yeah
2008560	2013680	and he starts fucking up the town with a giant mech and it's great and then uh sonic tails and
2013680	2019520	knuckles fly in it on the on the biplane they have their big giant fight it's a this big extended
2019520	2027440	action sequence um and then it turns out that the master emerald shatters after i think like
2027440	2032640	knuckles okay okay yeah knuckles punch okay after you know the the huge fight they all they all they
2032640	2036000	all get defeated by the mech and then you know they all group together and be like we have to
2036000	2042640	fight him together as a team and then they do and then knuckles punters after sonic distracts
2042640	2048800	eggman knuckles punches the emerald out of eggman's chest not in a bloody way just
2049200	2055120	to the chest and emerald comes out the back and then so the mech falls the emerald falls sonic
2055120	2060720	ends up dragging his half dead body over to it making this a lot more graphic than it actually
2062720	2067680	so but here's the thing the emerald shatters the emerald the master emerald breaks yes and inside
2067680	2071440	the master emerald are the seven chaos emeralds yes and i'm just like you have a huge grape
2071440	2075280	wood i do because the seven chaos emeralds are a different thing than the goddamn master emerald
2075360	2080720	they are different things but in this movie they're the same thing so the master emerald
2080720	2083760	breaks it turns out the seven chaos emeralds on the side of it it turns out sonic we already knew
2083760	2088880	the seven chaos technically inside yeah they mentioned it very early on yeah they got they
2088880	2092880	got a throwaway line about it yeah um and i was like what the fuck um but then sonic uses the
2093520	2100000	the the stop shaking the goddamn car jesus sonic uses the um master emerald sorry the chaos emerald
2100000	2105760	to become supersonic he destroys eggman's mech um eggman somehow gets away of course he does he
2105760	2110000	didn't they couldn't find his body in the big collapse no no you forgot the most important
2110000	2114800	part sonic becomes ultimate sonic i said that supersonic oh yeah i didn't hear it you said
2114800	2119520	ultimate in the theater so i assumed that's what the name was he he uses these i didn't say
2121680	2126320	he uses the seven chaos emeralds to become supersonic which is the just a super saiyan
2126480	2130720	super saiyan it's like dragon ball super saiyan but yeah you know what the fuck it is okay so
2131520	2136400	um everyone but me and then when the power runs out the emeralds scatter because they're
2136400	2141360	basically dragon balls they scatter um and then they're like well i guess we'll just all live in
2141360	2147360	green hills now and they do and then actually this is after knuckles somehow fixes the master
2147360	2151760	emerald with his hands oh he could do that in the games too that's actually fine he just goes
2151760	2155440	and then it's fine yeah yep and the math but here's the thing he fixes the master emerald
2155440	2158400	without having seven chaos emeralds in it so it still has some power but it's not the same thing
2158400	2165760	like i don't know yeah so in in the original continuity um the master emerald kept the
2165760	2170160	floating island floating yeah and it could also be used to regulate the powers of the seven chaos
2170160	2176240	emeralds but it was never required to have the master emerald to to become supersonic or to
2176240	2181440	become no i'm hyper knuckles or any other super forms um jesus christ i fucking remember all this
2181440	2186880	shit i remember all this shit when i was a kid okay anyway the end of the movie they all live
2186880	2190480	happily ever after in green hills till the next movie yeah and um including like like tails
2190480	2194160	knuckles just move in with them i guess they're just all hanging out now they're all kids now oh
2194160	2200960	and the pivotal emotional moment is when sonic calls tom dad yeah you're my dad and he's like
2200960	2208160	my son's a freak my son's a fucking alien no it is this is clark kent superman shit this is an
2208560	2212880	him and his wife are totally fine with it i don't even remember the wife's name
2212880	2217440	i don't actually think they imagine i'm just surprised that she's black why um because you
2217440	2222160	don't usually see a white guy with a black girl in like in hollywood yeah but they're trying to
2222160	2228000	change that now because wokeness yeah which is i i you know what i mean i guess yes okay
2230000	2234960	non-white guys with white girls that's wokeness white guys with non-white girls that's just based
2239120	2245440	i'm trolling i'm trolling i swear to god yeah so anyway anyway um the the post credit sequence
2245440	2251440	is is are the gun guys cleaning up the eggman mess yep and they discover there's a a secret
2252160	2259600	black site research facility where for 50 years they've been building shadow shadow with a quick
2259600	2265200	cameo from dr eggman's assistant so we know that dr eggman's definitely alive yeah definitely yeah
2265200	2271200	um and and here's the thing i said this to you in the in the theater um the story of sonic
2271200	2275920	adventure 2 which is the shadow story is predicated on sonic adventure 1 yeah because
2276560	2282560	sonic adventure 1 was was the story of the ancient echidnas and how they had this they fought this um
2283120	2288320	this primordial this primordial god inside the master emerald called i think it's called chaos
2288320	2294080	he's like he's like a blue goo man and when he absorbs when he absorbs um emeralds he becomes
2294080	2299040	stronger and then by the end of the game um there's a giant chaos monster destroying the city
2299040	2302800	and like millions are dead because it's like flooded and there's like it's fucking awful
2302800	2308560	and you play super sonic and you and you defeat them i think they just switched it for the owls
2309680	2313120	yeah but this like if they had actually made sonic adventure the movie that would have been
2313120	2316640	fucking amazing probably because that game was actually really good it was like it's probably
2316640	2323280	the best sonic game i think um and then sonic adventure 2 is a direct sequel where the idea
2323280	2331440	is that robotnik's grandfather was in charge of a satellite um a a space colony called called
2331440	2337680	space colony arc and they were they were using the knowledge of chaos that the echidnas had
2337680	2343840	to like they were making like false chaoses to use them as like like weapons um and they but
2343840	2349760	also at the same time uh they were i think were they trying to clone sonic but basically they
2349760	2355920	they ended up making shadow as as an experiment with with the emeralds and shadow is just as fast
2355920	2362080	as sonic he is he's basically what knuckles should have been like you know the coil he's he's just
2362080	2368640	emo sonic and everyone loves him yes and then he also like falls in love with a human woman
2368640	2377120	no what happens is um princess nope okay nope so what happens is um this is a robotnik's grandfather
2377120	2382160	was running the whole project yeah and she he had a daughter and this daughter was growing up
2382160	2387920	on the space station and she and shadow were friends yep but when they shut the project down
2387920	2392560	because the chaos creatures went out of control um gun basically went up there and purged everyone
2392560	2397920	and killed everyone yeah and shadow she like shadow uh was locked away by her i think and so
2397920	2401280	he was put into a tube for 50 years and she got like all she riddled up with bullets she was
2401280	2406160	fucking destroyed she was just shot shot the fuck up it was kind of a tragic scene actually um and
2406160	2409520	then shadow's like you know what i'm just gonna kill all of humanity fuck all of you look what you
2409520	2413920	fuck you you killed my only friend fuck you that's getting a good villain origin story i'm okay with
2413920	2422160	that yeah and and what ends up happening is like um in sonic adventure 2 robotnik like turns good
2422800	2426800	because he's like maybe we should maybe you know okay i mean my grandfather was kind of terrible
2426800	2431920	because my grandfather after like the grandfather after seeing his daughter died he like he's he
2431920	2435440	set up a whole bunch of shit that went down 50 years later to try and destroy the world
2435440	2439840	and robotics like maybe i should stop this so he like helps out robotnik turns good finally
2439840	2443440	which is not that common in the series actually but he turned good this time oh that's gonna be
2443440	2448560	weird for them to do that because robotic is like really evil he's really evil he's like he's
2448560	2453760	significantly more evil than the games like he he's not just like yeah i like was kind of like
2454320	2458880	uh this not a shitty scientist but i was a misunderstood scientist and now i'm just also
2458880	2465200	a mad scientist no like he's he's a mad scientist he's he's he's he's chaotic evil
2466640	2470560	he's actually he's still very funny though he's really goofy like jim carrey does a really good
2470560	2474640	job yeah i like it a lot he did a great job in the first we did a great job in this movie it's
2474640	2478240	funny it's really funny when i heard that jim carrey was going to be dr robonic i don't know
2478240	2482960	that that like to be fair i don't know that much about sonic but from like the little bit i do know
2482960	2488320	i was like that's gonna be fucking awful like it was actually really good he did such a good job
2488320	2492000	also because like robotics fat and he's not fat but it's like whatever yeah it doesn't matter
2492000	2495520	too much yeah it kind of matters but not really like it here's the thing here's the thing they're
2495520	2500640	still using all like the imagery and everything yeah and and and the thing is if he had done a
2500640	2505120	bad job i probably matter about the not fat thing but he did such a good job it is such a good job
2505120	2511440	so there's there's like um there's there's probably the funniest line i think is when
2511440	2516240	like he's flying around like a god inside of the mech and his assistant who's in like a pilot seat
2516240	2521360	or like the co-pilot seat is like sir you're magnificent and he's like thank you sycophant
2523840	2531600	yeah your admiration was inevitable and i was like yes like he just renames his lackey there
2531600	2537040	yeah to like like he has like all these different names for him you just they're all insulting yeah
2537040	2541280	and we're pretty sure that the lackey's in love with him but we're not entirely sure
2541280	2546320	yeah like there's there's a there's a lot of one-way homoeroticism coming from the lackey
2546320	2552000	towards robotnik yeah and robotic doesn't even care he like he doesn't like abuse him or anything
2552000	2556480	necessarily but he's like he doesn't even notice that it's happening yeah he doesn't even know
2556480	2562080	he's a giant fucking narcissist like yeah of course people love him i love me everyone loves me
2562080	2564160	yeah if you don't i'll just kill you
2568880	2574960	yeah so it it turns out that they're going to be doing for for the third movie they're going to do
2574960	2580960	shadow story shadow story from sonic adventure 2 which i think is not gonna work out unless they
2580960	2585200	somehow do sonic adventure 1 at the same time because this movie kind of did do sonic 2 and 3
2585200	2589920	and knuckles all at the same time yeah so maybe they could do like they could do like the first
2589920	2594880	act of the movie is them going to be explaining maybe sonic adventures and then they're going to
2594880	2598480	move on maybe i don't know because that's how we know that's how it's going to work because they
2598480	2601920	have like they didn't even explain tails that's how it's going to work yeah i guess they didn't
2601920	2606400	explain fucking anything if if there is a detriment to this movie it's how little things
2606400	2612160	are explained but that's because it's a kid's movie yeah and also because it's a movie and
2612160	2617360	they were going to run out of time yeah yeah they could have done like a tails movie then a knuckles
2617360	2620080	movie they didn't have them do knuckles in the third and then the second one they can do in the
2620080	2624480	third one you know they could have figured it out they could have spread out the material to be
2624480	2628640	honest maybe they were afraid that they like it wouldn't like get trashing because like prequels
2628640	2635760	generally don't do as well as i wonder how this one's doing sorry sequels don't generally do as
2635760	2640640	well as the first first movie so i wonder how well this one's gonna do well i guess we'll find out
2640640	2645200	yeah when all the internet because like it's kind of funny because because this is going out of
2645200	2651440	theaters this week is this final week yeah yeah that's why i suggested we go yeah yeah so there
2651440	2657920	is a wider conversation here where like do you recall the backlash against like star wars and
2657920	2666640	people because they're all terrible yeah including episode seven was okay episodes eight and nine
2666640	2670320	were both fucking awful yeah and people are like here's a misogynist here's because there's a girl
2670960	2675120	and it's like no no no no you can have a girl in star wars i don't fucking care
2675120	2678640	there's leia like who fucking cares no it's because they're bad yeah that's the problem
2678640	2686160	is that they're they were just bad movies yeah and that was it yep um these aren't bad
2686160	2690400	oh hold on though okay okay i'm waiting i'm like that what i'm getting to what i'm getting to
2690400	2696080	is that there has there has this there's this growing feeling of
2696320	2701520	partial disdain for your own audience in hollywood so so the situation is something like
2702160	2708080	oh i have this vision for for for star wars and so i'm gonna make the movies that i want to make
2708080	2711200	and then the audience feedback comes in and they fucking hate it and they're like well fuck you
2711200	2715680	you're just a misogynist and it's like well maybe or maybe your movie is bad and maybe you should
2715680	2722160	kind of figure it out yeah now there are a few movies that buck the trend because joker was
2722160	2726880	beloved and people fucking there was there was like weird progressives or beloved oh isn't it
2726880	2730800	the same thing i don't think it is okay well in any case you know what i mean there were like
2730800	2736240	weird progressives when joker came out saying like this is just a this is just a a movie that
2736240	2741040	lionizes white male rage and it's like shut the fuck up you're so jesus christ you're so stupid
2741040	2748320	you don't understand anything about anything just fucking eat a bullet okay um in minecraft okay um
2749280	2756320	in minecraft okay um and then there was sonic because i don't know if you did you see like the
2756320	2760080	the first leaks of the sonic movie and how fucking awful it looked yeah i did yeah yeah
2760080	2765280	yeah no i remember that everyone knows about that if you don't know about that you literally don't
2765280	2769840	have the internet like it was everywhere and people are like what the fuck like this looks
2769840	2774960	fucking terrible and then the company was like you know what okay we'll fix it yep well fair enough
2774960	2778560	and then they did right before the movie came out there were people who were saying
2778560	2787360	do not do not give in to the fans what do they they are entitled spoiled fucking misogynist
2787360	2792480	you know fucking reactionary brats do not give make the movie that you want to make don't give
2792480	2797600	them don't do what the fans want you to do and the song the the the uh the whoever made this
2797600	2802080	movie i don't know who they were they um they said how about we actually do what the fans want
2802560	2807840	and then the movie came out and it was a hit because it didn't look awful and i remember
2807840	2815120	that i sonic looked like a terrible stuffed like like what an off-brand stuffed animal
2815120	2821520	would look like if they had made that as a sonic doll and and and what's what's funny is like
2822480	2827040	this i think it's partially because the fans finally felt listened to the for the first time
2827040	2831360	in a while yeah this is like single-handedly revived sonic oh yeah 100 yeah like sonic was
2831360	2834560	a dead franchise there's no making games they all sucked like sonic forces sucked
2835120	2839840	um all sonic games are bad you've heard it here first that's not true that's not true
2839840	2843360	like recent sonic games have not been so good and sonic forces was absolutely fucking terrible
2843360	2849680	people had basically like sonic ever since like sonic heroes sonic has been known as this fucking
2849680	2855120	failed franchise and it's been like 20 games since sonic heroes there's been like two good ones
2855760	2861040	two or three um and then sonic forces come out and it was fucking trash and then people are just
2861040	2865600	like sonic is just fucking disgusting and then but this this this this movie was i don't know
2865600	2869840	how much money the first one made but it was so culturally successful that it basically revived
2869840	2874720	the sonic brand yeah and now we have a second movie and the second movie is it's still good
2874720	2878800	would you say is as good as the first i actually i would say this time it's about on par with the
2878800	2887520	first i'm i think i'm gonna say about on par um it like it sequels always tend to be it was a little
2887520	2893680	less you know some of the emotional moments didn't hit as hard you think so yeah because
2895680	2900160	because it was about um him tom it was about him and tom bonding and like sonic like
2900800	2906960	reaching adulthood you know but like coming like coming into his own after being on his own for so
2906960	2912800	long then in this movie he's still not on his own because he's uh he's like family but like tom just
2912800	2917280	wanted him to have like more people to hang out with other than just his parents yeah because he
2917280	2921920	can't go outside like he's a fucking alien yeah exactly yeah so then that that's more or less what
2921920	2928080	this movie was about but it didn't i feel like it didn't quite touch on that enough slash hard
2928080	2932960	enough slash hard enough slash hard enough slash hard yeah i couldn't make that into a proper
2932960	2941680	sentence there you go um so yeah yeah i think it's worth seeing if you like the first one oh
2941680	2945440	yeah definitely if you like the first one was good if you like the first one uh definitely watch this
2945440	2949440	one just remember that if you haven't seen the first one well obviously if you want like the
2949440	2954000	sonic lore to be exact you know it's not gonna be but it's fine it's still a good movie it's still
2954000	2959200	a good yeah just don't forget that it is specifically for like it's definitely catered to
2959200	2964000	children yeah yes like if you're a parent and you have like a nine-year-old that likes sonic they're
2964000	2967120	gonna love the shit out of it oh yeah they're gonna love it and watch it forever and that's
2967120	2970800	what you're gonna be watching for the next uh month two months about two months maybe three
2970880	2975280	maybe six maybe six happier maybe maybe until the next sonic movie comes out yeah you know
2975280	2980800	maybe yeah yeah so since jim carrey's retiring oh no i mean how what are you gonna do for sonic 3
2982560	2986080	they might get him back for sonic 3 yeah because here's the thing i heard that like
2986080	2989600	i kept i kept hearing that like jim carrey just wanted out of hollywood because it fucking sucked
2989600	2994000	yeah but he actually like he liked the robotnik role yeah and he was having fun with it he was
2994000	2999280	definitely having fun with it like i i didn't feel like he was a little slightly less funny
2999280	3003760	this time i said that in the theater i felt like it felt slightly less like the because in the
3003760	3008720	first movie jim carrey was definitely like jim carrying it up you know like he was being jim
3008720	3013920	care it was just funny this one it was just funny i but it definitely felt like he was kind of like
3014960	3020400	i want to say holding himself back a little bit for the character to come through a little more
3020400	3025680	you think so he's definitely still had his like jim carrie isms jim carrie isms jim carrie isms in
3025680	3030160	it you know it's still really good i'm not saying he wasn't funny it just like it felt like it felt
3030160	3034720	it felt slightly different from the first movie yeah and then to be honest i don't know if i agree
3034720	3038320	with you but i still like it i honestly probably have to watch them back to back because it's
3038320	3042480	actually let's go watch it again no it's been a while since i've seen the first one so i might
3042480	3047840	be totally wrong to be fair but you know yep so yeah yeah um is there anything else you want to
3047840	3052560	say about sonic 2 that's good are we gonna see the third one yeah when it comes out i want to
3052560	3062960	see emo sonic oh i'm ready i'm ready all right give me my lovable villain yeah so um i think the
3062960	3066880	first one of these trailer talks will come out on the main channel just to kind of kick start the
3066880	3071200	series again but the rest of them from now on if we keep doing more they're gonna go on finally
