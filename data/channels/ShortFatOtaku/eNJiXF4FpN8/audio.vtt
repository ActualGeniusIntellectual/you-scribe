00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
The reason people originally liked Star Wars is because despite the many flaws of these movies,

00:05.360 --> 00:09.440
it had something to say about the human condition. It's not really about stormtroopers and death

00:09.440 --> 00:13.520
stars and x-wings and lightsabers. Those are the trappings. That's the window dressing. That's what

00:13.520 --> 00:18.000
you drape over top of what should be a good solid story. George Lucas has correctly identified that

00:18.000 --> 00:22.560
A New Hope is more of a fantasy film than a sci-fi one. My original inspiration on this film was

00:22.560 --> 00:31.120
really to use mythological motifs to create a whole new kind of myth that was very updated

00:31.120 --> 00:37.280
and contemporary. So I used the Saturday matinee serial as my vessel to put this barrel of

00:37.280 --> 00:43.440
mythological motifs together. Since it's based on a very kind of old story and not a high-tech

00:43.440 --> 00:48.000
story, it's more of a fantasy film than a science fiction film, I was able to use archetypes which

00:48.000 --> 00:53.280
helped develop the characters and put them in a context where they could be easily grasped

00:53.280 --> 00:58.160
because they are traditional characters. And this is the same story that has been

00:58.160 --> 01:04.080
told a thousand times around the world for several thousand years. This is a mythic story.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.880
It models for us what it means to be a hero in a very generic sense. Luke Skywalker is a child

01:08.880 --> 01:13.440
of destiny given a magic sword by an old wizard and told to storm a fortress guarded by the Black

01:13.440 --> 01:18.080
Knight in order to rescue a princess. The scope and scale of the story, along with four 1977

01:18.080 --> 01:22.400
state-of-the-art effects, help cover up the fact that Star Wars is a very basic hero's journey.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.560
Meanwhile, The Empire Strikes Back turns us on its head. It's a story about how the hero deals

01:26.560 --> 01:30.560
with his own failure, how it's his own heroism that is the source of the failure, and how to

01:30.560 --> 01:34.720
come to grips with the terrible truth. Luke's heroic traits are well defined in A New Hope.

01:34.720 --> 01:39.680
He's courageous, loyal, and impulsive, all qualities well suited for a young man leaping

01:39.680 --> 01:44.400
to the defense of the helpless. But in Empire, these qualities lead him to a confrontation with

01:44.400 --> 01:50.320
Vader that he isn't ready for and he loses badly. Yoda tells him point blank before it even happens.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.800
But Luke has to experience it to truly understand the path that he's on.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.960
Return of the Jedi is the culmination of this story. Luke's first appearance in the movie,

02:06.960 --> 02:10.160
he's acting a little bit more Sith-like than the audience should be comfortable with,

02:10.160 --> 02:15.200
but at the same time, he's also more patient. He allows Jabba to make aggressive moves and mistakes

02:15.200 --> 02:19.680
while his own plan unfolds. This is what integrating your dark side looks like.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.920
By the end of the movie, Luke refuses to kill Vader. In fact, at the end of all three movies,

02:23.920 --> 02:28.480
Luke gives up control and takes a leap of faith. It's not a foregone conclusion that

02:28.480 --> 02:32.320
Vader will rescue him from the Emperor's forced lightning. Luke is doing this knowing full well

02:32.320 --> 02:36.480
he might die, but the statement is clear. Luke is not going to become his father,

02:36.480 --> 02:41.040
even if it kills him. Yeah, sometimes George Lucas is caught huffing his farts a bit too much.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.760
But even then, the point I'm making is, when you strip away all the Star Wars stuff here,

03:01.760 --> 03:06.000
there's a soul. A moral and ethical throughline that cuts right down the center of Luke and his

03:06.000 --> 03:09.600
journey. The movies are trying to tell us something about what it means to be a hero,

03:09.600 --> 03:13.920
what quality of character a hero has, where that might lead them astray sometimes,

03:13.920 --> 03:18.000
and ultimately what somebody might have to sacrifice in order to live a good life.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.280
And George Lucas is okay with outright saying, yeah, that's what the movies are all about.

03:31.760 --> 03:40.560
They set about to recreate myths and the classic mythological motifs, because I think the core

03:40.560 --> 03:45.200
issues that I'm dealing with are, if they were valid 2,000 years ago, they've got to still be

03:45.200 --> 03:49.360
valid today, even though they're not in fashion. Why are they out of fashion?

03:49.360 --> 03:54.880
The world we live in is more complex. A lot of those moralities have gotten to be grayed

03:54.880 --> 03:59.040
to the point where they don't exist anymore, but those issues are still there in most people's

03:59.040 --> 04:03.920
minds. The importance of, say, friendship and loyalty. Most people look at that and say,

04:03.920 --> 04:08.880
how corny. But the issues of friendship and loyalty are very, very important,

04:08.880 --> 04:12.320
but it's not common knowledge among young people. They're still learning. They're still

04:12.320 --> 04:16.880
picking up ideas. They're still using these ideas to shape the way they're going to conduct their

04:16.880 --> 04:22.080
life. And you need to tell the same story over and over again every generation, so that generation

04:22.080 --> 04:26.160
gets it. And I think we've gone for a few generations where a lot of the sort of more

04:26.160 --> 04:32.000
basic stories have fallen by the wayside. I hear so many young people today talk about

04:32.000 --> 04:39.040
a world that's emptied of heroism, where there are no more noble things to do. What do you say

04:39.040 --> 04:44.400
to them? Everybody has the choice of being a hero or not being a hero every day of their lives.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.560
And you can either help somebody be compassionate toward people, you can treat some people with

04:50.560 --> 04:56.320
dignity, or not. And one way you become a hero, and the other way, you know, you're part of the

04:56.320 --> 05:04.400
problem. And it's not a grand thing. You know, you don't have to get into a giant laser sword fight

05:04.400 --> 05:09.760
and blow up three spaceships to become a hero. I mean, it's a very small thing that happens every

05:09.760 --> 05:14.080
day of your life. Though people don't like the prequel trilogy nearly as much, they're still

05:14.080 --> 05:18.640
remembered fondly for being the mess that they are. And Lucas is also quite insistent that these

05:18.640 --> 05:23.920
films also have something to say beyond just Star Wars. In fact, Padme even spotlights the message

05:23.920 --> 05:33.120
in case you don't get it. One of the reasons the prequel trilogy talks so much about politics and

05:33.120 --> 05:38.320
economics is because it's showing what a fearless, well-meaning, impatient young hero, somebody very

05:38.320 --> 05:43.200
much like Luke, in fact, can become if he doesn't take the sacrificial path that Luke did. Take that

05:43.200 --> 05:47.120
scene from episode two where Padme and Anakin talk politics. Yeah, that one that became a reaction

05:47.120 --> 05:54.320
meme for a while. I don't think the system works. How would you have it work? We need a system where

05:54.320 --> 05:59.520
the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interest of all the

05:59.520 --> 06:05.840
people, and then do it. That's exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree.

06:06.640 --> 06:12.640
Well, then they should be made to. By whom? Who's gonna make them? I don't know. Someone. You? Of

06:12.640 --> 06:20.160
course not me. But someone. Someone wise. Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. Well,

06:21.200 --> 06:26.320
if it works. This is actually the monarchist argument against democracy. If democracy really

06:26.320 --> 06:31.040
is just a bunch of squabbling, uneducated fools, all having their worthless say while a crisis

06:31.040 --> 06:35.600
grows more desperate, why shouldn't a strong individual with the expertise to solve the problem

06:35.600 --> 06:40.400
be in charge instead? It's the benevolent dictator, philosopher king argument. Palpatine's populist

06:40.400 --> 06:44.720
rhetoric during his rise to power, if you transplant it to real life, is probably pretty

06:44.720 --> 06:48.000
popular with libertarians and how he wants to dismantle components of the state and end

06:48.000 --> 06:54.480
corruption and shrink bureaucracy. There is no civility, only politics. The senate is full of

06:55.120 --> 07:02.960
greedy squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. If I may say so your majesty,

07:02.960 --> 07:09.440
the chancellor has little real power. He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption

07:09.440 --> 07:15.760
the bureaucrats are in charge now. Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger

07:15.760 --> 07:22.480
supreme chancellor, one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice. Any other choice

07:22.480 --> 07:28.640
would be to submit a plea to the courts. The courts take even longer to decide things than

07:28.640 --> 07:34.240
the senate. Your majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption. I will be

07:34.240 --> 07:39.280
chancellor. I fear about the time you have control of the bureaucrats, senator. There'll be nothing

07:39.280 --> 07:44.880
left of our people, our way of life. It is clear to me now that the republic no longer functions.

07:45.680 --> 07:50.480
I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate. But what his supporters don't

07:50.480 --> 07:55.440
understand and what he keenly recognizes is that all of those multiple levels of bureaucracy are

07:55.440 --> 08:00.640
what keeps political power decentralized. That decentralization has led to their current problem

08:00.640 --> 08:04.400
where there's too many interests, nobody can agree on anything and nothing gets done even in the face

08:04.400 --> 08:08.880
of a civil war. But stripping away those bureaucratic layers, however popular a move it might initially

08:08.880 --> 08:13.440
be, doesn't destroy the political power vested within them. It simply centralizes that power

08:13.440 --> 08:18.160
within the remaining bureaucracy. The rebellion will continue to gain a support in the imperial

08:18.160 --> 08:24.160
senate. The imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that

08:24.160 --> 08:29.920
the emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the old republic have been

08:29.920 --> 08:36.400
swept away. It's impossible. How will the emperor maintain control that the bureaucracy? The regional

08:36.400 --> 08:41.920
governors now have direct control over their territories. It may very well be the case that

08:41.920 --> 08:45.120
if the people within a state's apparatus are corrupt, you might need to clean house. I'm not

08:45.120 --> 08:49.360
against that. But contrary to what libertarians think, shrinking the state doesn't always shrink

08:49.360 --> 08:54.080
its power. Sometimes it centralizes that power into a system with a single point of failure.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.880
That's why the rebellion's decisive strikes at just the right target are so devastating throughout

08:58.880 --> 09:03.040
the series. Because when you weaken a state's bureaucracy, you monopolize the state's power

09:03.040 --> 09:07.600
into one autocratic leader. And at that point, all you have to do is kill him. That is the lesson

09:07.600 --> 09:12.240
of the prequels. The dangers of seduction, both sexual and political. It's tempting to think that

09:12.240 --> 09:17.200
you know all the answers. That you can handle the forbidden fruit. But you don't. And you can't.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.360
Of course, the prequels have many problems. Like a lot of what the Jedi are don't really make sense.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.800
For example, why do the Jedi wear these robes? Well, because that's what Obi-Wan wore in the

09:24.800 --> 09:29.200
original trilogy. But if Obi-Wan's in hiding, why would he specifically run around in the uniform

09:29.200 --> 09:32.800
of a persecuted class of people? Why do all the Jedi act like creepy cult members? Well,

09:33.120 --> 09:37.680
Luke's journey from regular kid to Jedi Knight saw him become serious and somber. But that's only

09:37.680 --> 09:41.280
because of what he was going through with his father. That is the limitation of George Lucas's

09:41.280 --> 09:45.360
iconic hero's journey style of storytelling. When it butts up against a cultural phenomenon,

09:45.360 --> 09:50.080
whatever becomes emblematic of an idea is what sticks, even if it doesn't really make any sense.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.480
But it's this rough around the edges nature of Lucas's Star Wars that lead internet soy boys

09:54.480 --> 09:59.920
nowadays to justify the moral bankruptcy of Disney's Star Wars. So if the original story

09:59.920 --> 10:04.320
is telling us how to be a sacrificial hero, and the prequel story is telling us what happens if

10:04.320 --> 10:09.520
you reject the call, what does the sequel trilogy tell us? As far as I can tell, The Force Awakens

10:09.520 --> 10:13.520
exists to tell us that Star Wars is really cool. Everything is a reference or a callback. But they

10:13.520 --> 10:18.400
exist not as trappings of a larger story, but as the larger story itself. Where before the movies

10:18.400 --> 10:22.480
would explain a political crisis and the various parties they're in, or a personal conflict between

10:22.480 --> 10:26.000
characters with a lot of history, now the movie goes out of its way to not explain anything at

10:26.000 --> 10:30.400
all. JJ Abrams said he wanted the Star Wars comedy back. But where before comedy accentuated

10:30.400 --> 10:34.400
characterization, here it undercuts it. The characters in the setting are reset back to

10:34.400 --> 10:38.000
the way things were in A New Hope, only this time with less explanation. There's an empire and a

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
rebellion with different names. Luke is isolated from everyone, Leia is a political leader fighting

10:42.000 --> 10:46.160
the power. Han Solo is a smooth talker, desperately trying to hide the fact that he's a broke bum.

10:46.160 --> 10:50.720
All of the growth and change is reversed so we can do Star Wars again. What does The Last Jedi

10:50.720 --> 10:55.760
have to tell us? Well, pretty much the opposite of The Force Awakens. Star Wars is bad. Where an

10:55.760 --> 11:00.480
empire Luke would never abandon his friends, and in Return of the Jedi Luke chose not to kill the

11:00.480 --> 11:04.720
defenseless. Here we discover that Luke did both of those things in his old age. Everyone talks

11:04.720 --> 11:09.120
about the phrase subverting expectations with this movie, and yeah, fair enough. It's like 90%

11:09.120 --> 11:13.680
complete dog shit, with so many scenes that add nothing and make no sense, and in fact make other

11:13.680 --> 11:18.560
things make less sense. I really don't want to go into just how bad this movie is right now,

11:18.560 --> 11:23.280
this video is long enough, but I don't think the phrase subvert expectations is the ethic of this

11:23.280 --> 11:28.000
movie. Instead it can be summed up in these scenes. It's time to let old things die.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.200
Snoke. Skywalker.

11:35.920 --> 11:42.480
The Sith. The Jedi. The Rebels. Let it all die. Let the past die.

11:43.200 --> 11:53.600
Kill it if you have to. We are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.

11:53.600 --> 11:57.920
The idea here is that Star Wars is changing. It doesn't have to be about Skywalkers and

11:57.920 --> 12:01.520
Kenobi's anymore. It can be about anybody. That's the point of the final shot of the movie. This kid

12:01.520 --> 12:06.400
isn't anybody important, and yet he can use the Force. It's a grand moral equalization. The old

12:06.400 --> 12:10.400
institutions don't matter. We can make things how we want them to be, and they don't need to be Star

12:11.360 --> 12:16.560
Wars. So what is the Rise of Skywalker telling us then? Well, the lesson of The Force Awakens

12:16.560 --> 12:20.880
is that we can no longer make anything new. We must remain tethered to what Star Wars was.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.880
At the same time, the lesson of The Last Jedi is that we can no longer hold on to anything old.

12:24.880 --> 12:29.520
The slate must be wiped clean. Despite how it sounds, these two ideas actually fit together.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.440
In a Hegelian sense, if The Force Awakens is the thesis and The Last Jedi is the antithesis,

12:33.440 --> 12:37.840
The Rise of Skywalker is the synthesis. It's a movie that is simultaneously tethered to the past

12:37.840 --> 12:42.720
while rejecting it. It wipes the slate clean and then uses that space to build a simulacrum of what

12:42.720 --> 12:47.280
came before. The ethics of Star Wars at this point are gone, and what remains is only the window

12:47.280 --> 12:51.360
dressing. There are X-wings and lightsabers and stormtroopers and star destroyers, but the core

12:51.360 --> 12:57.120
has been hollowed out. That's why it rings so hollow when Carrie Fisher says it's about family

12:57.120 --> 13:01.520
and that's what's so powerful about it. We know they're not. They're about being about family,

13:01.520 --> 13:04.960
which is a very different idea. At least Mark Hamill was a lot more honest about them.

13:05.920 --> 13:11.840
I said to Ryan, I said, I think I fundamentally disagree with pretty much everything you've

13:11.840 --> 13:18.480
decided for me. Now, having said that, I have to accept it, get my mind around it, and do my best

13:18.480 --> 13:25.280
to realize your vision. I said to Ryan, I said, Jedi's don't give up. I mean, even if he had a

13:25.280 --> 13:31.440
problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup, but if he made a mistake, he would try

13:31.440 --> 13:36.640
and right that wrong. So right there, we had a fundamental difference, but it's not my story

13:36.640 --> 13:42.800
anymore. It's somebody else's story, and Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending

13:42.800 --> 13:51.440
effective. That's the crux of my problem. Luke would never say that. I'm sorry. Well, in this

13:51.440 --> 13:56.880
version, see, I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars. This is the next generation of Star

13:56.880 --> 14:03.200
Wars. So I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he's Jake Skywalker. He's not my

14:03.200 --> 14:10.480
Luke Skywalker, but I had to do what Ryan wanted me to do because it serves the story well. But

14:10.480 --> 14:15.440
listen, I still haven't accepted it completely, but it's only a movie. I hope people like it.

14:15.440 --> 14:20.800
I hope they don't get upset. In other words, the Star Wars sequel trilogy teaches us how you build

14:20.800 --> 14:25.920
a progressive skin suit. First, stagnation is celebrated by way of worshiping the aesthetics

14:25.920 --> 14:30.320
of the thing. Secondly, revolution is celebrated by way of discrediting all the old ethical

14:30.320 --> 14:35.120
achievements of the thing. Finally, these two ideas are married into a creation that is simply

14:35.120 --> 14:40.000
mechanical in how it operates. Scenes happen only because they must happen to reach the next scene.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.560
Conflicts or revelations or sacrifices occur, not because they further anything, but because this is

14:44.560 --> 14:48.880
around the point in time the audience expects to see one. Nothing makes sense, but nothing needs

14:48.880 --> 14:53.600
to because we've deconstructed the idea of cause and effect. Things might be set up and then paid

14:53.600 --> 14:58.880
off like in an actual movie, but there's no underlying action and reaction. The progressive

14:58.880 --> 15:04.160
skin suit is complete. It looks like Star Wars, but deep inside it is in fact anti-Star Wars.
