0	5360	The reason people originally liked Star Wars is because despite the many flaws of these movies,
5360	9440	it had something to say about the human condition. It's not really about stormtroopers and death
9440	13520	stars and x-wings and lightsabers. Those are the trappings. That's the window dressing. That's what
13520	18000	you drape over top of what should be a good solid story. George Lucas has correctly identified that
18000	22560	A New Hope is more of a fantasy film than a sci-fi one. My original inspiration on this film was
22560	31120	really to use mythological motifs to create a whole new kind of myth that was very updated
31120	37280	and contemporary. So I used the Saturday matinee serial as my vessel to put this barrel of
37280	43440	mythological motifs together. Since it's based on a very kind of old story and not a high-tech
43440	48000	story, it's more of a fantasy film than a science fiction film, I was able to use archetypes which
48000	53280	helped develop the characters and put them in a context where they could be easily grasped
53280	58160	because they are traditional characters. And this is the same story that has been
58160	64080	told a thousand times around the world for several thousand years. This is a mythic story.
64080	68880	It models for us what it means to be a hero in a very generic sense. Luke Skywalker is a child
68880	73440	of destiny given a magic sword by an old wizard and told to storm a fortress guarded by the Black
73440	78080	Knight in order to rescue a princess. The scope and scale of the story, along with four 1977
78080	82400	state-of-the-art effects, help cover up the fact that Star Wars is a very basic hero's journey.
82400	86560	Meanwhile, The Empire Strikes Back turns us on its head. It's a story about how the hero deals
86560	90560	with his own failure, how it's his own heroism that is the source of the failure, and how to
90560	94720	come to grips with the terrible truth. Luke's heroic traits are well defined in A New Hope.
94720	99680	He's courageous, loyal, and impulsive, all qualities well suited for a young man leaping
99680	104400	to the defense of the helpless. But in Empire, these qualities lead him to a confrontation with
104400	110320	Vader that he isn't ready for and he loses badly. Yoda tells him point blank before it even happens.
119040	122800	But Luke has to experience it to truly understand the path that he's on.
122800	126960	Return of the Jedi is the culmination of this story. Luke's first appearance in the movie,
126960	130160	he's acting a little bit more Sith-like than the audience should be comfortable with,
130160	135200	but at the same time, he's also more patient. He allows Jabba to make aggressive moves and mistakes
135200	139680	while his own plan unfolds. This is what integrating your dark side looks like.
139680	143920	By the end of the movie, Luke refuses to kill Vader. In fact, at the end of all three movies,
143920	148480	Luke gives up control and takes a leap of faith. It's not a foregone conclusion that
148480	152320	Vader will rescue him from the Emperor's forced lightning. Luke is doing this knowing full well
152320	156480	he might die, but the statement is clear. Luke is not going to become his father,
156480	161040	even if it kills him. Yeah, sometimes George Lucas is caught huffing his farts a bit too much.
177520	181760	But even then, the point I'm making is, when you strip away all the Star Wars stuff here,
181760	186000	there's a soul. A moral and ethical throughline that cuts right down the center of Luke and his
186000	189600	journey. The movies are trying to tell us something about what it means to be a hero,
189600	193920	what quality of character a hero has, where that might lead them astray sometimes,
193920	198000	and ultimately what somebody might have to sacrifice in order to live a good life.
198000	201280	And George Lucas is okay with outright saying, yeah, that's what the movies are all about.
211760	220560	They set about to recreate myths and the classic mythological motifs, because I think the core
220560	225200	issues that I'm dealing with are, if they were valid 2,000 years ago, they've got to still be
225200	229360	valid today, even though they're not in fashion. Why are they out of fashion?
229360	234880	The world we live in is more complex. A lot of those moralities have gotten to be grayed
234880	239040	to the point where they don't exist anymore, but those issues are still there in most people's
239040	243920	minds. The importance of, say, friendship and loyalty. Most people look at that and say,
243920	248880	how corny. But the issues of friendship and loyalty are very, very important,
248880	252320	but it's not common knowledge among young people. They're still learning. They're still
252320	256880	picking up ideas. They're still using these ideas to shape the way they're going to conduct their
256880	262080	life. And you need to tell the same story over and over again every generation, so that generation
262080	266160	gets it. And I think we've gone for a few generations where a lot of the sort of more
266160	272000	basic stories have fallen by the wayside. I hear so many young people today talk about
272000	279040	a world that's emptied of heroism, where there are no more noble things to do. What do you say
279040	284400	to them? Everybody has the choice of being a hero or not being a hero every day of their lives.
285360	290560	And you can either help somebody be compassionate toward people, you can treat some people with
290560	296320	dignity, or not. And one way you become a hero, and the other way, you know, you're part of the
296320	304400	problem. And it's not a grand thing. You know, you don't have to get into a giant laser sword fight
304400	309760	and blow up three spaceships to become a hero. I mean, it's a very small thing that happens every
309760	314080	day of your life. Though people don't like the prequel trilogy nearly as much, they're still
314080	318640	remembered fondly for being the mess that they are. And Lucas is also quite insistent that these
318640	323920	films also have something to say beyond just Star Wars. In fact, Padme even spotlights the message
323920	333120	in case you don't get it. One of the reasons the prequel trilogy talks so much about politics and
333120	338320	economics is because it's showing what a fearless, well-meaning, impatient young hero, somebody very
338320	343200	much like Luke, in fact, can become if he doesn't take the sacrificial path that Luke did. Take that
343200	347120	scene from episode two where Padme and Anakin talk politics. Yeah, that one that became a reaction
347120	354320	meme for a while. I don't think the system works. How would you have it work? We need a system where
354320	359520	the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interest of all the
359520	365840	people, and then do it. That's exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree.
366640	372640	Well, then they should be made to. By whom? Who's gonna make them? I don't know. Someone. You? Of
372640	380160	course not me. But someone. Someone wise. Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. Well,
381200	386320	if it works. This is actually the monarchist argument against democracy. If democracy really
386320	391040	is just a bunch of squabbling, uneducated fools, all having their worthless say while a crisis
391040	395600	grows more desperate, why shouldn't a strong individual with the expertise to solve the problem
395600	400400	be in charge instead? It's the benevolent dictator, philosopher king argument. Palpatine's populist
400400	404720	rhetoric during his rise to power, if you transplant it to real life, is probably pretty
404720	408000	popular with libertarians and how he wants to dismantle components of the state and end
408000	414480	corruption and shrink bureaucracy. There is no civility, only politics. The senate is full of
415120	422960	greedy squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. If I may say so your majesty,
422960	429440	the chancellor has little real power. He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption
429440	435760	the bureaucrats are in charge now. Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
435760	442480	supreme chancellor, one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice. Any other choice
442480	448640	would be to submit a plea to the courts. The courts take even longer to decide things than
448640	454240	the senate. Your majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption. I will be
454240	459280	chancellor. I fear about the time you have control of the bureaucrats, senator. There'll be nothing
459280	464880	left of our people, our way of life. It is clear to me now that the republic no longer functions.
465680	470480	I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate. But what his supporters don't
470480	475440	understand and what he keenly recognizes is that all of those multiple levels of bureaucracy are
475440	480640	what keeps political power decentralized. That decentralization has led to their current problem
480640	484400	where there's too many interests, nobody can agree on anything and nothing gets done even in the face
484400	488880	of a civil war. But stripping away those bureaucratic layers, however popular a move it might initially
488880	493440	be, doesn't destroy the political power vested within them. It simply centralizes that power
493440	498160	within the remaining bureaucracy. The rebellion will continue to gain a support in the imperial
498160	504160	senate. The imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that
504160	509920	the emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the old republic have been
509920	516400	swept away. It's impossible. How will the emperor maintain control that the bureaucracy? The regional
516400	521920	governors now have direct control over their territories. It may very well be the case that
521920	525120	if the people within a state's apparatus are corrupt, you might need to clean house. I'm not
525120	529360	against that. But contrary to what libertarians think, shrinking the state doesn't always shrink
529360	534080	its power. Sometimes it centralizes that power into a system with a single point of failure.
534080	538880	That's why the rebellion's decisive strikes at just the right target are so devastating throughout
538880	543040	the series. Because when you weaken a state's bureaucracy, you monopolize the state's power
543040	547600	into one autocratic leader. And at that point, all you have to do is kill him. That is the lesson
547600	552240	of the prequels. The dangers of seduction, both sexual and political. It's tempting to think that
552240	557200	you know all the answers. That you can handle the forbidden fruit. But you don't. And you can't.
557200	561360	Of course, the prequels have many problems. Like a lot of what the Jedi are don't really make sense.
561360	564800	For example, why do the Jedi wear these robes? Well, because that's what Obi-Wan wore in the
564800	569200	original trilogy. But if Obi-Wan's in hiding, why would he specifically run around in the uniform
569200	572800	of a persecuted class of people? Why do all the Jedi act like creepy cult members? Well,
573120	577680	Luke's journey from regular kid to Jedi Knight saw him become serious and somber. But that's only
577680	581280	because of what he was going through with his father. That is the limitation of George Lucas's
581280	585360	iconic hero's journey style of storytelling. When it butts up against a cultural phenomenon,
585360	590080	whatever becomes emblematic of an idea is what sticks, even if it doesn't really make any sense.
590080	594480	But it's this rough around the edges nature of Lucas's Star Wars that lead internet soy boys
594480	599920	nowadays to justify the moral bankruptcy of Disney's Star Wars. So if the original story
599920	604320	is telling us how to be a sacrificial hero, and the prequel story is telling us what happens if
604320	609520	you reject the call, what does the sequel trilogy tell us? As far as I can tell, The Force Awakens
609520	613520	exists to tell us that Star Wars is really cool. Everything is a reference or a callback. But they
613520	618400	exist not as trappings of a larger story, but as the larger story itself. Where before the movies
618400	622480	would explain a political crisis and the various parties they're in, or a personal conflict between
622480	626000	characters with a lot of history, now the movie goes out of its way to not explain anything at
626000	630400	all. JJ Abrams said he wanted the Star Wars comedy back. But where before comedy accentuated
630400	634400	characterization, here it undercuts it. The characters in the setting are reset back to
634400	638000	the way things were in A New Hope, only this time with less explanation. There's an empire and a
638000	642000	rebellion with different names. Luke is isolated from everyone, Leia is a political leader fighting
642000	646160	the power. Han Solo is a smooth talker, desperately trying to hide the fact that he's a broke bum.
646160	650720	All of the growth and change is reversed so we can do Star Wars again. What does The Last Jedi
650720	655760	have to tell us? Well, pretty much the opposite of The Force Awakens. Star Wars is bad. Where an
655760	660480	empire Luke would never abandon his friends, and in Return of the Jedi Luke chose not to kill the
660480	664720	defenseless. Here we discover that Luke did both of those things in his old age. Everyone talks
664720	669120	about the phrase subverting expectations with this movie, and yeah, fair enough. It's like 90%
669120	673680	complete dog shit, with so many scenes that add nothing and make no sense, and in fact make other
673680	678560	things make less sense. I really don't want to go into just how bad this movie is right now,
678560	683280	this video is long enough, but I don't think the phrase subvert expectations is the ethic of this
683280	688000	movie. Instead it can be summed up in these scenes. It's time to let old things die.
691280	693200	Snoke. Skywalker.
695920	702480	The Sith. The Jedi. The Rebels. Let it all die. Let the past die.
703200	713600	Kill it if you have to. We are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.
713600	717920	The idea here is that Star Wars is changing. It doesn't have to be about Skywalkers and
717920	721520	Kenobi's anymore. It can be about anybody. That's the point of the final shot of the movie. This kid
721520	726400	isn't anybody important, and yet he can use the Force. It's a grand moral equalization. The old
726400	730400	institutions don't matter. We can make things how we want them to be, and they don't need to be Star
731360	736560	Wars. So what is the Rise of Skywalker telling us then? Well, the lesson of The Force Awakens
736560	740880	is that we can no longer make anything new. We must remain tethered to what Star Wars was.
740880	744880	At the same time, the lesson of The Last Jedi is that we can no longer hold on to anything old.
744880	749520	The slate must be wiped clean. Despite how it sounds, these two ideas actually fit together.
749520	753440	In a Hegelian sense, if The Force Awakens is the thesis and The Last Jedi is the antithesis,
753440	757840	The Rise of Skywalker is the synthesis. It's a movie that is simultaneously tethered to the past
757840	762720	while rejecting it. It wipes the slate clean and then uses that space to build a simulacrum of what
762720	767280	came before. The ethics of Star Wars at this point are gone, and what remains is only the window
767280	771360	dressing. There are X-wings and lightsabers and stormtroopers and star destroyers, but the core
771360	777120	has been hollowed out. That's why it rings so hollow when Carrie Fisher says it's about family
777120	781520	and that's what's so powerful about it. We know they're not. They're about being about family,
781520	784960	which is a very different idea. At least Mark Hamill was a lot more honest about them.
785920	791840	I said to Ryan, I said, I think I fundamentally disagree with pretty much everything you've
791840	798480	decided for me. Now, having said that, I have to accept it, get my mind around it, and do my best
798480	805280	to realize your vision. I said to Ryan, I said, Jedi's don't give up. I mean, even if he had a
805280	811440	problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup, but if he made a mistake, he would try
811440	816640	and right that wrong. So right there, we had a fundamental difference, but it's not my story
816640	822800	anymore. It's somebody else's story, and Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending
822800	831440	effective. That's the crux of my problem. Luke would never say that. I'm sorry. Well, in this
831440	836880	version, see, I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars. This is the next generation of Star
836880	843200	Wars. So I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he's Jake Skywalker. He's not my
843200	850480	Luke Skywalker, but I had to do what Ryan wanted me to do because it serves the story well. But
850480	855440	listen, I still haven't accepted it completely, but it's only a movie. I hope people like it.
855440	860800	I hope they don't get upset. In other words, the Star Wars sequel trilogy teaches us how you build
860800	865920	a progressive skin suit. First, stagnation is celebrated by way of worshiping the aesthetics
865920	870320	of the thing. Secondly, revolution is celebrated by way of discrediting all the old ethical
870320	875120	achievements of the thing. Finally, these two ideas are married into a creation that is simply
875120	880000	mechanical in how it operates. Scenes happen only because they must happen to reach the next scene.
880000	884560	Conflicts or revelations or sacrifices occur, not because they further anything, but because this is
884560	888880	around the point in time the audience expects to see one. Nothing makes sense, but nothing needs
888880	893600	to because we've deconstructed the idea of cause and effect. Things might be set up and then paid
893600	898880	off like in an actual movie, but there's no underlying action and reaction. The progressive
898880	904160	skin suit is complete. It looks like Star Wars, but deep inside it is in fact anti-Star Wars.
