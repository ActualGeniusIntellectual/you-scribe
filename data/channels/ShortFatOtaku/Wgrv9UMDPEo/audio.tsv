0	2820	Hey guys, Dev here, doing another update vlog for you.
2820	6680	It's March 1st, and I'm gonna go over some changes happening to the channel right now.
6680	11800	I'm sure some of you have noticed that there is now a Patreon link on the end slates of
11800	12800	our Let's Plays.
12800	15600	Yes, we've given in to the dark side and started up a Patreon.
15600	19300	For those of you who don't know, Patreon is a service where you can incrementally pay
19300	21820	your favourite internet content producers.
21820	23720	It's sort of become a big thing recently.
23720	28920	A lot of mid-sized video producers like TheSpoonieOne and such are using it.
28920	34600	It also became a big thing negatively because in Gamergate people discovered that developers
34600	37680	and journalists were donating to each other's Patreons.
37680	40640	And I'm sure we'll have a whole Indiefensible video coming up on that soon.
40640	44040	Patreon is different from something like Indiegogo or Kickstarter.
44040	50420	Indiegogo, Kickstarter, GoFundMe, those type of things, they're to fund a single project.
50420	58640	You know, um, just a famous and controversial example was Anita Sarkeesian getting a boatload
58640	60160	of money to do videos.
60160	65680	Now I'm not here to discuss Anita Sarkeesian at all, that's a topic for another video.
65680	73520	But basically, her campaign was set up like you give her a total sum of money, she creates
73520	75400	a video series.
75400	79880	And that model works for a Kickstarter or for an Indiegogo.
79880	80880	But Patreon's different.
80880	88560	Patreon is an ongoing payment where as people produce the content, you pay them in pieces.
88560	94000	So you know, for example, I think Spoonie's Patreon is set up so that every time he releases
94000	97040	a new review, you're supposed to pay him money.
97040	99560	And that exchange happens automatically.
99560	104800	He puts up a video, he tells Patreon, they withdraw from the account.
104800	107560	Other people's Patreons are set up monthly.
107560	109000	And there has been abuse with this.
109000	113980	Again, in Gamergate, people have discovered that, you know, there are people like Indie
113980	118980	game developers who are just breaking in money through Patreon monthly on a monthly
118980	120500	basis for doing nothing.
120500	125140	And we're not going to be like that because I think anyone who's watched our channel for
125140	129100	any amount of time knows we put out two videos a day.
129100	136220	So our Patreon is going to be a monthly contribution so that you, if you're so inclined, and we
136220	140940	would be very grateful if you were, decide to give us money through Patreon every month
140940	146740	you'd pay so much, we would put that towards the show.
146740	150660	And it makes sense for us because we put out so many videos.
150660	154220	The idea of having you pay for every video is kind of absurd.
154220	159180	And Patreon even suggests that people who put out consistent content like us go buy
159180	160180	a monthly plan.
160180	161180	So that's what we're going to do.
161180	165520	Lord Cat has done some talking about Patreon recently, where he mentioned that a lot of
165520	173040	people who do Patreons set their goals for individual contributors.
173040	175080	They set them kind of stupidly.
175080	176080	And here's what I'll mean.
176080	180760	Like, say you're, I'm just going to use the gamer game example again, because it's what's
180760	182200	on my brain right now.
182200	185200	Say you're an Indie developer, and you have a Patreon.
185200	190480	And one of the goals is, okay, if you donate $50 every month, I'll make you an Indie game.
190480	192200	Okay, great.
192200	195000	So let's say I'm going to invest in that person.
195000	200120	I invest 50 bucks for one month, I get my Indie game.
200120	204480	And what is my incentive to keep giving $50 every month?
204480	208680	That was a one time reward for a monthly contribution.
208680	213520	One time rewards work for things like Kickstarter, wherein you're backing an entire project,
213520	218200	and you get a reward from the project, along with the project itself, but it doesn't work
218200	223520	for an ongoing payment like Patreon, which is why we've actually kind of, over here we've
223520	227280	kind of gone back and forth with the idea of should we do a Kickstarter or something
227280	231740	like that versus should we do a Patreon, we ultimately decided to go with Patreon because
231740	237120	we're not funding a new project per se, you know, our channels already going, the channel
237120	239480	would continue to go.
239480	244220	Even without the money, though, it would probably go worse, but it would continue to go.
244220	248760	It's not it's not like with a Kickstarter where if a Kickstarter fails a project stops,
248760	253320	our channel, even if even if this Patreon idea completely falls apart on us, we're still
253320	255300	going to keep making stuff on our channel.
255300	259640	So here's how our Patreon is going to work.
259640	264200	We're coming up with a mechanism that will allow people to view the daily videos, which
264200	266700	is the Let's Play stuff earlier.
266700	270640	So if you were to contribute not a large amount, probably some small amount, like 10 bucks
270640	277600	or something a month, you could see the videos during that month, probably about a week ahead
277600	279600	of schedule, a week earlier than everyone else.
279600	283680	And that probably sounds pretty weak, admittedly.
283680	291960	But here's the thing, every other good alternative we thought of would have been one time, one
291960	294780	time rewards, which don't fit with a Patreon.
294780	299760	Like if you wanted, okay, if you wanted to donate, say 50 bucks a month, and we do an
299760	304560	anime review for you, okay, after we after you do your review, you know, why would you
304560	308960	keep donating $50 you know, it's kind of ridiculous.
308960	315880	We do have a separate system set up, where if you want to donate a DVD copy of an anime,
315880	318080	then we will do a review of that for you.
318080	319800	And that that's outside of Patreon.
319800	322600	But that is really the only goal we've thought of.
322600	327600	And because we don't expect to get much, admittedly much money from this.
327600	330380	So it's a small goal for a small Patreon.
330380	332940	I think it fits.
332940	336380	It is something that is ongoing and somewhat substantive.
336380	340500	So you would get your $10 worth at least if you like our stuff and want to see it sooner.
340500	345020	And I will promise you that whenever we get money from Patreon and decide to spend that
345020	348180	money on something, it will be towards the show.
348180	355380	We do plan to buy new equipment, to buy some hardware, maybe to buy games or anime to use
355380	361140	on the show, props, lighting, you know, costumes.
361140	366600	And any time we buy something with your money, we will publicly post the receipt so you can
366600	368340	see exactly where it's going.
368340	370440	There will be more details in the Patreon to come.
370440	375740	We're hoping to have it set up by April so that April is when the monthly rewards will
375740	376980	start rolling out.
376980	378040	So in one month.
378040	381880	And with any luck we'll get enough money out of it that we could expand the program, maybe
381880	383680	offer some different rewards.
383680	388800	We do also want to have total sum rewards where if we manage to get, say, X amount of
388800	392800	dollars in total, we could do a certain project.
392800	397920	I know our ultimate goal for this channel is the following.
397920	401960	Two Let's Play videos daily.
401960	406900	One indefensible gamergate video weekly.
406900	410720	Two anime reviews monthly.
410720	414280	And then on top of all that, really anything else that we could throw in.
414280	417800	Like if you wanted to do, if you wanted to like go see a movie and do a vlog about it,
417800	418800	we could do that.
418800	424840	If I wanted to finally pick up the slack on doing the Pokemon retrospective, I definitely
424840	426040	want to do that.
426040	430440	And I mean, we're going to try to do that whether we get paid from you guys or not.
430440	431440	This is no pressure.
431440	432440	We're going to try.
432440	435340	We've been trying for a while.
435340	436480	But the money would help.
436480	438760	We could buy things that were missing and so on and so forth.
438760	442040	But I mean, don't, of course, don't feel obligated.
442040	443040	Don't feel obligated.
443040	445120	We're a fucking tiny internet show.
445120	447240	But it would help us with those goals.
447240	449200	It would be appreciated.
449200	453260	You would get at least the meager rewards that we could offer and it would all go towards
453260	455020	the show and you'd see proof of that.
455020	459560	Now on the topic of the end slate, when we put the Patreon link into the end slate, we
459560	460880	took out the BlipTV link.
460880	463760	And I'm going to go over just what's going on there.
463760	470640	I'm sure a lot of you already know this, but basically BlipTV is closing its doors.
470640	479760	And there was a time in which, this was back in 2009, 2008, when actually YouTube didn't
479760	481680	make YouTubers any money.
481680	484240	The money was on BlipTV.
484240	490360	And if you could get on BlipTV and then even better get on a conglomerate site, the big
490360	496680	one back then was that guy with the glasses, you could actually make serious internet money.
496680	502440	Because YouTube back then, in 2009, was considered just a place to kind of build an audience
502440	504200	but not really make money off the audience.
504200	509760	You had to build a YouTube audience, then get accepted on BlipTV.
509760	513520	Even better, get accepted on one of these sites, because Blip paid out significantly
513520	515280	more than YouTube.
515280	516400	And we got lucky.
516400	521400	You know, right during Blip's heyday, August 2009, we got on BlipTV and we started posting
521400	526360	our anime reviews on BlipTV and they started actually getting decent hits and getting money.
526360	531720	And for a good while there, we actually had a bigger following on Blip than we did on
531720	532720	YouTube.
532720	537720	But then I think in like 2012 or something, Maker, the YouTube studio, the network, bought
537720	540080	Blip and it's kind of gone downhill since then.
540080	547960	They started purging people from Blip so that content producers were kicked off, usually
547960	551720	because they didn't meet Blip's standards of quality.
551720	553880	Luckily, we stayed on.
553880	554880	I don't know how.
554880	558880	I mean, there are people there who I think were better than us that got the boot and
558880	559880	we didn't.
559880	565280	And everybody has seen this coming for about a year now because there's been every, between
565280	569520	six and nine months, there's been new cuts of people saying, okay, we're going to tighten
569520	573320	the rules some more, kick more people out, tighten the rules again, kick more people
573320	574320	out.
574320	579280	We've survived each purge from Blip, but it's not the site that it used to be.
579280	584320	It's pretty obvious that when Maker bought Blip, they just kind of wanted the exclusive
584320	586140	talent that was signed to Blip.
586140	589160	There were some contributors on Blip TV that were only on Blip TV.
589160	594480	They had like contracts with Blip that made them exclusive and Maker wanted them.
594480	596680	Maker wanted them on their network, so they bought Blip to get them.
596680	602080	And then after that, Maker really didn't care what happened to Blip.
602080	606440	So the Blip surge has gone down.
606440	612240	The money is back on YouTube again and Blip is ultimately closing its doors and becoming
612240	613240	Maker TV.
613240	615720	And it will be a Maker only service.
615720	621000	And even then, not for everybody on Maker, only for like the privileged few that the
621000	624980	top of Maker will be, will have their videos hosted on Maker TV.
624980	626760	So I mean, we are leaving Blip.
626760	628000	It's not really a priority for us anymore.
628000	632900	It's not a priority for anybody anymore, but it's not really a big deal because Blip's prominence
632900	633900	has faded.
633900	637720	I mean, we'll still upload to Blip like when it's convenient.
637720	642160	I mean, if, for example, no one in the house is using the internet and we got a couple
642160	645400	episodes that we haven't uploaded to Blip yet, we can put out and just slap them up
645400	648280	there, get maybe two bucks off them before the service closes.
648280	650460	It's not a big deal, but it's no longer a priority.
650460	656240	But the reason I bring up Blip is to bring up Maker because I do want to talk about YouTube
656240	661020	MCNs, multi-channel networks, because we have joined one, in fact.
661020	665840	We haven't made any cash on our YouTube channel in about six months.
665840	668440	And for the longest time, the money that we got was from Blip.
668440	672320	In fact, during the heyday of Blip, we were getting about a hundred bucks a month.
672320	677640	Nothing you can live off of, but it paid for props, it paid for anime, it paid for lighting
677640	679360	equipment.
679360	681260	It paid for pretty much everything that the show has right now.
681260	682520	Was that a hundred bucks a month?
682520	689200	So recently we kind of had the one-two punch of coming to grips with the fact that we weren't
689200	693960	having any copyright problems with YouTube, but we were placed in a non-trusted state
693960	699440	where we had to prove that we could monetize every video, even if it would, like, normally
699440	704560	YouTube will allow you to monetize and then let people claim against it.
704560	709180	We got put into a state where we could not monetize without proving it first.
709180	712880	So because of that, we haven't made any money on YouTube recently.
712880	718320	So there was the one-two punch of recognizing that situation as being something we could
718320	726600	no longer handle by ourselves, coupled with the fact that our revenue on Blip between
726600	733120	December and January dropped from about seventy-five bucks to two bucks.
733120	738680	The fact that Blip is now finally just giving out its last breath, and we realized we had
738680	741160	to, you know, rectify the situation somehow.
741160	745800	Camera's first thought, because she handled most of the multi-channel network stuff that
745800	747060	we ended up doing.
747060	748940	Her first thought was to look into joining Maker.
748940	750540	I mean, it made sense.
750540	754260	We were on Blip TV, we had been kept on through multiple purges.
754260	757100	Maker was turning Blip TV into a Maker-only service.
757100	762500	You know, why not try to get on Maker and be like, hey, can we still use Blip after
762500	763500	the doors close?
763500	766640	And that was a good idea.
766640	769220	And then, like, somebody from Maker said, yeah, you could do that.
769220	773740	Somebody else from Maker said, well, we have to talk about this first, like, I don't know.
773740	776140	And they kind of gave us the runaround.
776180	779420	We did get a yes, we did get a no, we did get a lot of maybes.
779420	783020	But it was always a, hold on, we'll get back to you, you know, we'll look over the contract
783020	786020	and we'll see if we can fit it in, and we'll do this and that.
786020	791380	And, you know, as we were waiting for them to make up their minds and to finally come
791380	797140	to a decision, because we did hear pretty much every answer under the sun from them,
797140	800540	we sort of realized that, yeah, Blip doesn't matter anymore.
801300	805460	You know, like, assume that we went with Maker and they said, yes, you can stay on Blip.
805460	808020	What will we actually get out of that?
808020	810780	I mean, like I said, Blip is not the place that it used to be.
810780	813420	There was actually a point in time, like I said before, that we actually had a bigger
813420	815380	following on Blip than YouTube.
815380	820500	There was actually a point in time when people visited the Blip main page, the Blip portal,
820500	822260	and discovered new shows.
822260	824860	And people actually got discovered through Blip.
824860	828460	At this point, the main page hasn't been updated in like eight months.
828460	836540	Our knee-jerk desire to go with Maker, to stay on Blip, was kind of rooted in more of
836540	842060	like a nostalgia and kind of like a past way of thinking where Blip was actually prominent
842060	843700	and now it's not.
843700	847740	And as they were kind of hemming and hawing over there, we realized that, yeah, it's not
847740	848740	prominent anymore.
848740	855500	And as soon as Blip was taken out of the equation, we didn't have any specific reason to go with
855500	856500	Maker.
856540	861620	No offense to them, they'll do fine without us.
861620	868900	But with Blip out of the picture, the only thing that we needed from an MCN was to solve
868900	873380	our non-trusted state problem, and any MCN can do that.
873380	877460	So at that point, we began looking into other networks.
877460	881620	Heard of Fullscreen, I've heard many terrible things about Fullscreen.
881620	884500	We all unanimously said no to that.
884500	888500	The same with Curse the Lesso, definitely the same with Machinima.
888500	892460	I've heard stories of people signing up with Machinima and then losing their channels,
892460	894500	like Machinima now owns your brand.
894500	899260	And then we started looking at Screenwave Media, and actually when the three of us sat
899260	902760	down to kind of cast our votes, camera wanted to join Screenwave Media.
902760	906520	It does have some decently big names on it, it also has a few of our internet friends
906520	912180	on it as well, and something that Camera Lady liked was that it had its own proprietary
912180	913180	media player.
913180	919300	Macau Maker has Blip, Screenwave the network has Screenwave the player.
919300	923780	Now I want to point this out because this is how we're different from a lot of other
923780	924780	YouTubers.
924780	928780	We don't like having all of our eggs in one basket, we liked uploading to YouTube and
928780	933940	to Blip, so that if one channel got fried, the other one would still exist.
933940	936220	It's always good to have a backup.
936220	940660	You don't want to completely depend on YouTube, even during this era of YouTube dominance,
940660	942500	you don't want to completely depend on it, in my opinion.
942500	947660	And I mean, when we started our channel, YouTube was kind of the place to be to see our content,
947660	949600	and Blip was the backup.
949600	954740	And then as time went on, Blip became the main place to see our content, and YouTube
954740	958720	was our backup, because that's just where the numbers and the money were at the time.
958720	962980	Camera really wanted Screenwave, because Screenwave has that player.
962980	967860	But then Dave and I both told her, you know, if you want to diversify, not have all your
967860	970700	eggs in one basket, this isn't the way to do it.
970700	976460	You know, Screenwave, for as cool as I'm sure they are, if we did that, we would have
976460	981700	our stuff on Screenwave, the media player, and then our stuff on YouTube through Screenwave.
981700	983660	Like, you're not diversifying there.
983660	987900	And ultimately we decided to go with the Freedom Network.
987900	997900	Freedom is not as big as the big three of Machinima, Fullscreen, and Maker.
997900	999620	It's kind of structured a little bit differently.
999820	1004580	Freedom is like an overarching network that supports a bunch of smaller networks, all
1004580	1009580	with their own contracts, and their own rules, and their own leaders, but still ultimately
1009580	1013360	financially backed by Freedom, at least this is how I think it works.
1013360	1019380	And the group we ended up joining was called Creator, and Creator is run by Queenie from
1019380	1020380	Gamergate.
1020380	1029180	And I mean, as soon as we joined Creator and Freedom, I don't exactly know how to parse
1029180	1030180	the two terms.
1030180	1033220	We're with both of them, but one's a subset of the other.
1033220	1037540	But as soon as we joined them, our copyright issues were resolved on YouTube, which is
1037540	1038540	great.
1038540	1041300	That's pretty much the one thing we wanted out of a network, and we got it.
1041300	1044740	And we do, of course, trust her because she's from Gamergate.
1044740	1050640	And I think what was most important to me personally is that it was not a lock-in contract.
1050640	1056680	We can leave their network anytime we want, given them 30 days notice.
1056680	1060240	It's not like with Maker, where Maker wanted you to stay for two years and then have an
1060240	1063020	auto-renew contract that you had to fight your way out of.
1063020	1067560	Because really, we're new to the multi-channel network thing.
1067560	1071080	We're just sort of experimenting with it right now.
1071080	1076560	This is no offense to Queenie or Creators if she's watching this, but we don't quite
1076560	1079480	know how this will play out.
1079480	1084260	We're just sort of taking it one step at a time and kind of exploring the possibilities.
1084260	1090560	So it being a first network, it being a trial run for us, and kind of just getting used
1090560	1093960	to the idea, it is nice that we can leave.
1093960	1098460	We just sort of want to try this out and see how it goes, and not be with a gigantic penalty
1098460	1101960	if we decide that MCNs just aren't our thing, or whatever.
1101960	1102960	You know?
1102960	1105980	Basically, it's our first try and we're going it slow.
1105980	1108860	And I don't think that should reflect poorly on them at all.
1108860	1112660	If anything, it should reflect poorly on us, because we have no fucking clue what we're
1112660	1113660	doing.
1114060	1116420	What can freedom or creator have to do with the show?
1116420	1117420	Nothing.
1117420	1119900	You're still going to get the content at the same times.
1119900	1122820	They're just going to give us a hand with some copyright issues, give us a hand with
1122820	1130140	some search engine optimization stuff, and then we'll kind of see how we like the partnership
1130140	1131140	and then go from there.
1131140	1134140	So that's really where we stand right now.
1134140	1138620	Starting a Patreon, it's got shit rewards, because we're a small channel.
1138620	1141900	If you want to help out, that's great.
1141900	1146780	We'll expand things as we go, we'll figure out how it works as we go, and we will prove
1146780	1148780	to you that your money is not being wasted.
1148780	1150380	BlipTV is closing.
1150380	1154460	It makes absolutely no difference to anybody at this point, because BlipTV is archaic and
1154460	1155740	it's going to be gone.
1155740	1159780	It's a ghost town, and when it becomes Maker TV, it will be even more of a ghost town.
1159780	1160940	And the market will adjust.
1160940	1164380	Someone else will show up with a new video carrier and everyone's going to flock to it
1164380	1165420	and it's going to be great.
1165420	1168180	Maybe Daily Motion's going to rise to prominence again.
1168180	1173100	Maybe Lord Cat's new video startup I hear he's doing will actually become a big thing.
1173100	1174100	Who knows?
1174100	1177060	Maybe Vimeo will start allowing ads, though I doubt that'll happen.
1177060	1181620	However, BlipTV closing means that we join the Freedom multichannel network under Queenie's
1181620	1185980	creators subnetwork within Freedom.
1185980	1189340	They've helped us a lot, even though it's only been like a week and they're great, and
1189340	1193500	it's not going to impede the actual progress of our show, which is what you guys care about
1193500	1194500	the most.
1194500	1198460	I do want to talk a bit about the schedule of those video game episodes.
1198460	1201980	I'm sure you all have noticed, it's taken us a while to get through games, and part
1201980	1206300	of that is just due to Dave not playing them very well.
1206300	1210780	However, a lot of that is because we just have too much on our plate, and we had this
1210780	1216220	problem a year ago, where a year ago we were posting, we had like six games on the go,
1216220	1221360	and we posted one part of a game on Monday, one part of the second game on Tuesday, one
1221360	1226240	part of the third game on Wednesday, and Thursday, Friday, Saturday, then back to Monday
1226240	1229920	we post the second part of the first game, and then on Tuesday we post the second part
1229920	1230920	of the second game.
1230920	1233240	And we realized really quickly that was kind of ridiculous.
1233240	1238880	You know, it shouldn't take three months to get through a game, but it did for us because
1238880	1241000	we were posting one part a week.
1241000	1247760	So when the summer came along, the summer of 2014, we started posting two videos a day
1247760	1250360	and we started posting them in large blocks, and we started getting through games that
1250360	1251360	way.
1251360	1256220	But then we basically, we just took on too many games, we started too many games.
1256220	1259720	Games that we intended to finish, because like, there are certain games that we're obviously
1259720	1260720	not going to finish.
1260720	1265080	Like, we're not going to play like a Mario Party to completion to get 100% in that game,
1265080	1266080	that's ridiculous.
1266080	1269360	But there are games that we do at least want to beat, if not 100%.
1269360	1270880	Our internal schedule works like this.
1270880	1276440	We have a rotation of six games, well five games now, because we just finished Sonic
1276440	1277440	and Knuckles.
1277620	1284360	Rogue Legacy, then Super Mario Sunshine, then our Pokemon Soul Silver Ballock run, then
1284360	1289600	Muramasa the Demon Blade, then Snatcher, and then Sonic and Knuckles.
1289600	1293280	Now that we just finished Sonic and Knuckles, there's only five games in the rotation.
1293280	1299040	And basically what we would do is, either camera lady or myself, since I do some editing
1299040	1303220	now, we would edit up a session of, say, Rogue Legacy.
1303220	1305220	That would go out.
1305220	1309900	The accompanying Rogue Legacy would be a session of Super Mario Sunshine.
1309900	1312140	So that would go out.
1312140	1316540	Whichever one of those sessions ended first on the release schedule, on the YouTube upload
1316540	1324000	schedule, in that slot would be the session of Pokemon Soul Silver.
1324000	1330160	And then whatever session ended next, whether that be Sunshine or Soul Silver, then taking
1330160	1333660	that spot would be Muramasa.
1333660	1338560	Then whatever session ended next, it would be Snatcher, and then Sonic, and then back
1338560	1340360	to Rogue Legacy.
1340360	1342840	Additionally, we have special games.
1342840	1348040	Skyward Sword is one of those special games, Mario Kart, Smash, anything that requires
1348040	1354440	people more than Dave or I would consider a special game, because Dave and I can film
1354440	1355440	this anytime we want.
1355440	1356440	We live together.
1356440	1358440	We can do it every day of the week if we want.
1358440	1363040	Getting other people's kind of a task sometimes, and that's not a slight to them, it's just
1363040	1365340	people have lives.
1365340	1371580	So whenever we get something from them, we put it up either as soon as possible, or if
1371580	1374180	it's a holiday show, whenever appropriate.
1374180	1380220	So these two factors combined, the abundance of special games we have on the go, and the
1380220	1386780	random availability of the people involved in them, along with six full-time games, we
1386780	1391740	were posting twice a day, and we were rotating session to session, not game to game, one
1391740	1397360	at a time, it was still taking a full month to get back to the next session.
1397360	1403400	We started posting the first session of Rogue Legacy at the beginning of January, the second
1403400	1406160	session came out near the end of January.
1406160	1410280	That's still a bit too inconsistent for my taste, and I'm sure for some of the viewer
1410280	1411280	tastes as well.
1411280	1412280	I'm just assuming.
1412280	1417720	I mean, I wouldn't want to shoot myself in the foot here, but I wouldn't want to watch
1417720	1421720	a channel that kept rotating large numbers of games and only getting back to the games
1421720	1424160	that I liked every once in a while.
1424160	1425640	So here's what we've decided to do.
1425640	1429580	The special games will stay the same as they always were.
1429580	1432720	Whenever they're available, they're available, and that's just how it has to be, because
1432720	1435180	it involves people other than myself or Dave.
1435180	1441620	The main games, those five in the rotation now that Sonic's done, we're not starting
1441620	1446560	any new games until that's cut down to at least two, preferably one.
1446560	1452960	You know, at the time of filming this, we've completed about two-thirds of Mario Sunshine,
1452960	1456800	though it hasn't come out yet, but we've completed about two-thirds.
1456800	1461800	Muramasa is nearly complete, Snatcher is done, it just has to come out, we have to wait for
1461800	1466440	the schedule to get to it, but we've finished Snatcher.
1466440	1472120	The two big ones left are Pokemon Soul Silver, which we're just barely halfway through at
1472120	1477500	this point, and Rogue Legacy, which we're also just barely halfway through at this point.
1477500	1482840	So before we start any new projects, we're going to start completing some of these games.
1482840	1487440	And when we get to a point where we only have, say, Rogue Legacy and Pokemon Soul Silver,
1487440	1493120	because those are two just giant beasts of a game, at that point, maybe we'll start bringing
1493120	1494120	in new games.
1494120	1498120	Because, I mean, I want to start the next Banjo, I also want to start the next Sonic
1498120	1500060	and kind of get that series back underway.
1500060	1504860	I know Dave really wants to play Charles Barkley again, and so do I, and we have begun
1504860	1509360	filming a completely new game unrelated to any old series, but again, we're not going
1509360	1514500	to release it until we free up some time with the schedule, because it's kind of getting
1514500	1516060	ridiculous at this point.
1516060	1521260	So throughout the month of March, we're going to really try and get this stuff done, so
1521260	1524900	hopefully there'll be space for new games very soon.
1524900	1528340	And I mean, if he wants to play something, all you have to do is ask, you can't promise
1528340	1531620	when we'll get around to it, but if we have a copy of it, sure, we'll play it.
1531620	1537740	The gift rule still applies, where if somebody decides to send us a game, or maybe send us
1537740	1545020	money with the express note attached saying, buy this game with this money, I guess, then
1545020	1548660	we will put that request at the head of the line.
1548660	1553940	We will say, you know what, you just gave us something, we're going to do this for you.
1553940	1557700	You know, because you're being generous, we're going to give you what you want.
1557700	1561060	You give us an anime, we'll give you a review, it'll be the next thing we do.
1561060	1565420	You give us a video game, we'll give you a let's play, it'll be the next thing we play.
1565420	1570060	We've always wanted to reward fans that have decided to give us something, admittedly there
1570060	1575500	haven't been many over the years, but there have been some, for example, Bible Black happened
1575500	1578780	because we actually got the DVDs for Bible Black from somebody.
1578780	1585140	So yeah, we did several riffs of that monstrosity because of fans.
1585140	1589180	And that's our upcoming schedule, you know, whether you donate or not, whether the money
1589180	1595140	works out or not, whether the freedom network works out or not, we are going to try our
1595140	1602980	very hardest for two video game shows a day, one gamergate video a week, two anime reviews
1602980	1603980	a month.
1603980	1608620	I can't guarantee anything, but we are going to try.
1608620	1613980	And again, no obligation, but the higher that Patreon number goes, the more likely we'll
1613980	1615300	get it done.
1615300	1621620	And that's not blackmailer me trying to be a money-grubbing jerk, that's just an economic
1621620	1622620	fact.
1622620	1625100	That's just how it is, you know.
1625100	1630660	The show has grown, and it's grown to the point that either it needs to start funding
1630660	1636620	itself again after BlipTV goes under, or we need to basically cut it out.
1636620	1641340	And to all of us here, cutting it out is not an option, we love doing this.
1641340	1647500	So if you're still with me, thanks for listening, and let's hope the coming months work out,
1647500	1649420	in all these endeavours.
1649420	1651740	Endeavours.
