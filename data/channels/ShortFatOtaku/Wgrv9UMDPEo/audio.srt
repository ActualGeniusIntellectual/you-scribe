1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Hey guys, Dev here, doing another update vlog for you.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,680
It's March 1st, and I'm gonna go over some changes happening to the channel right now.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm sure some of you have noticed that there is now a Patreon link on the end slates of

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
our Let's Plays.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,600
Yes, we've given in to the dark side and started up a Patreon.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,300
For those of you who don't know, Patreon is a service where you can incrementally pay

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,820
your favourite internet content producers.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,720
It's sort of become a big thing recently.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,920
A lot of mid-sized video producers like TheSpoonieOne and such are using it.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,600
It also became a big thing negatively because in Gamergate people discovered that developers

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,680
and journalists were donating to each other's Patreons.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,640
And I'm sure we'll have a whole Indiefensible video coming up on that soon.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,040
Patreon is different from something like Indiegogo or Kickstarter.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,420
Indiegogo, Kickstarter, GoFundMe, those type of things, they're to fund a single project.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:58,640
You know, um, just a famous and controversial example was Anita Sarkeesian getting a boatload

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,160
of money to do videos.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,680
Now I'm not here to discuss Anita Sarkeesian at all, that's a topic for another video.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,520
But basically, her campaign was set up like you give her a total sum of money, she creates

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,400
a video series.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,880
And that model works for a Kickstarter or for an Indiegogo.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
But Patreon's different.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,560
Patreon is an ongoing payment where as people produce the content, you pay them in pieces.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,000
So you know, for example, I think Spoonie's Patreon is set up so that every time he releases

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
a new review, you're supposed to pay him money.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,560
And that exchange happens automatically.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,800
He puts up a video, he tells Patreon, they withdraw from the account.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,560
Other people's Patreons are set up monthly.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,000
And there has been abuse with this.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,980
Again, in Gamergate, people have discovered that, you know, there are people like Indie

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,980
game developers who are just breaking in money through Patreon monthly on a monthly

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,500
basis for doing nothing.

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,140
And we're not going to be like that because I think anyone who's watched our channel for

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,100
any amount of time knows we put out two videos a day.

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:16,220
So our Patreon is going to be a monthly contribution so that you, if you're so inclined, and we

35
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,940
would be very grateful if you were, decide to give us money through Patreon every month

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,740
you'd pay so much, we would put that towards the show.

37
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,660
And it makes sense for us because we put out so many videos.

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,220
The idea of having you pay for every video is kind of absurd.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,180
And Patreon even suggests that people who put out consistent content like us go buy

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
a monthly plan.

41
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,180
So that's what we're going to do.

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,520
Lord Cat has done some talking about Patreon recently, where he mentioned that a lot of

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:53,040
people who do Patreons set their goals for individual contributors.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,080
They set them kind of stupidly.

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
And here's what I'll mean.

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,760
Like, say you're, I'm just going to use the gamer game example again, because it's what's

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
on my brain right now.

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Say you're an Indie developer, and you have a Patreon.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,480
And one of the goals is, okay, if you donate $50 every month, I'll make you an Indie game.

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,200
Okay, great.

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,000
So let's say I'm going to invest in that person.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,120
I invest 50 bucks for one month, I get my Indie game.

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,480
And what is my incentive to keep giving $50 every month?

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,680
That was a one time reward for a monthly contribution.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,520
One time rewards work for things like Kickstarter, wherein you're backing an entire project,

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,200
and you get a reward from the project, along with the project itself, but it doesn't work

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,520
for an ongoing payment like Patreon, which is why we've actually kind of, over here we've

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,280
kind of gone back and forth with the idea of should we do a Kickstarter or something

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,740
like that versus should we do a Patreon, we ultimately decided to go with Patreon because

60
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,120
we're not funding a new project per se, you know, our channels already going, the channel

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,480
would continue to go.

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,220
Even without the money, though, it would probably go worse, but it would continue to go.

63
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,760
It's not it's not like with a Kickstarter where if a Kickstarter fails a project stops,

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,320
our channel, even if even if this Patreon idea completely falls apart on us, we're still

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,300
going to keep making stuff on our channel.

66
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,640
So here's how our Patreon is going to work.

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,200
We're coming up with a mechanism that will allow people to view the daily videos, which

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,700
is the Let's Play stuff earlier.

69
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,640
So if you were to contribute not a large amount, probably some small amount, like 10 bucks

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,600
or something a month, you could see the videos during that month, probably about a week ahead

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
of schedule, a week earlier than everyone else.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,680
And that probably sounds pretty weak, admittedly.

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,960
But here's the thing, every other good alternative we thought of would have been one time, one

74
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,780
time rewards, which don't fit with a Patreon.

75
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,760
Like if you wanted, okay, if you wanted to donate, say 50 bucks a month, and we do an

76
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,560
anime review for you, okay, after we after you do your review, you know, why would you

77
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,960
keep donating $50 you know, it's kind of ridiculous.

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,880
We do have a separate system set up, where if you want to donate a DVD copy of an anime,

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,080
then we will do a review of that for you.

80
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,800
And that that's outside of Patreon.

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,600
But that is really the only goal we've thought of.

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,600
And because we don't expect to get much, admittedly much money from this.

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,380
So it's a small goal for a small Patreon.

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,940
I think it fits.

85
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,380
It is something that is ongoing and somewhat substantive.

86
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,500
So you would get your $10 worth at least if you like our stuff and want to see it sooner.

87
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,020
And I will promise you that whenever we get money from Patreon and decide to spend that

88
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,180
money on something, it will be towards the show.

89
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,380
We do plan to buy new equipment, to buy some hardware, maybe to buy games or anime to use

90
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,140
on the show, props, lighting, you know, costumes.

91
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,600
And any time we buy something with your money, we will publicly post the receipt so you can

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,340
see exactly where it's going.

93
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,440
There will be more details in the Patreon to come.

94
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,740
We're hoping to have it set up by April so that April is when the monthly rewards will

95
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,980
start rolling out.

96
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,040
So in one month.

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,880
And with any luck we'll get enough money out of it that we could expand the program, maybe

98
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,680
offer some different rewards.

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,800
We do also want to have total sum rewards where if we manage to get, say, X amount of

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
dollars in total, we could do a certain project.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,920
I know our ultimate goal for this channel is the following.

102
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,960
Two Let's Play videos daily.

103
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,900
One indefensible gamergate video weekly.

104
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,720
Two anime reviews monthly.

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,280
And then on top of all that, really anything else that we could throw in.

106
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,800
Like if you wanted to do, if you wanted to like go see a movie and do a vlog about it,

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
we could do that.

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,840
If I wanted to finally pick up the slack on doing the Pokemon retrospective, I definitely

109
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,040
want to do that.

110
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,440
And I mean, we're going to try to do that whether we get paid from you guys or not.

111
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
This is no pressure.

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
We're going to try.

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,340
We've been trying for a while.

114
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,480
But the money would help.

115
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,760
We could buy things that were missing and so on and so forth.

116
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,040
But I mean, don't, of course, don't feel obligated.

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Don't feel obligated.

118
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,120
We're a fucking tiny internet show.

119
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,240
But it would help us with those goals.

120
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,200
It would be appreciated.

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,260
You would get at least the meager rewards that we could offer and it would all go towards

122
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,020
the show and you'd see proof of that.

123
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,560
Now on the topic of the end slate, when we put the Patreon link into the end slate, we

124
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,880
took out the BlipTV link.

125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,760
And I'm going to go over just what's going on there.

126
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm sure a lot of you already know this, but basically BlipTV is closing its doors.

127
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:59,760
And there was a time in which, this was back in 2009, 2008, when actually YouTube didn't

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,680
make YouTubers any money.

129
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
The money was on BlipTV.

130
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,360
And if you could get on BlipTV and then even better get on a conglomerate site, the big

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,680
one back then was that guy with the glasses, you could actually make serious internet money.

132
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,440
Because YouTube back then, in 2009, was considered just a place to kind of build an audience

133
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,200
but not really make money off the audience.

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,760
You had to build a YouTube audience, then get accepted on BlipTV.

135
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,520
Even better, get accepted on one of these sites, because Blip paid out significantly

136
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,280
more than YouTube.

137
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,400
And we got lucky.

138
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,400
You know, right during Blip's heyday, August 2009, we got on BlipTV and we started posting

139
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,360
our anime reviews on BlipTV and they started actually getting decent hits and getting money.

140
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,720
And for a good while there, we actually had a bigger following on Blip than we did on

141
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
YouTube.

142
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,720
But then I think in like 2012 or something, Maker, the YouTube studio, the network, bought

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,080
Blip and it's kind of gone downhill since then.

144
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,960
They started purging people from Blip so that content producers were kicked off, usually

145
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,720
because they didn't meet Blip's standards of quality.

146
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,880
Luckily, we stayed on.

147
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I don't know how.

148
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
I mean, there are people there who I think were better than us that got the boot and

149
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
we didn't.

150
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,280
And everybody has seen this coming for about a year now because there's been every, between

151
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,520
six and nine months, there's been new cuts of people saying, okay, we're going to tighten

152
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,320
the rules some more, kick more people out, tighten the rules again, kick more people

153
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
out.

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,280
We've survived each purge from Blip, but it's not the site that it used to be.

155
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,320
It's pretty obvious that when Maker bought Blip, they just kind of wanted the exclusive

156
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,140
talent that was signed to Blip.

157
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,160
There were some contributors on Blip TV that were only on Blip TV.

158
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,480
They had like contracts with Blip that made them exclusive and Maker wanted them.

159
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,680
Maker wanted them on their network, so they bought Blip to get them.

160
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,080
And then after that, Maker really didn't care what happened to Blip.

161
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,440
So the Blip surge has gone down.

162
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,240
The money is back on YouTube again and Blip is ultimately closing its doors and becoming

163
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Maker TV.

164
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,720
And it will be a Maker only service.

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,000
And even then, not for everybody on Maker, only for like the privileged few that the

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,980
top of Maker will be, will have their videos hosted on Maker TV.

167
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,760
So I mean, we are leaving Blip.

168
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,000
It's not really a priority for us anymore.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,900
It's not a priority for anybody anymore, but it's not really a big deal because Blip's prominence

170
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
has faded.

171
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,720
I mean, we'll still upload to Blip like when it's convenient.

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,160
I mean, if, for example, no one in the house is using the internet and we got a couple

173
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,400
episodes that we haven't uploaded to Blip yet, we can put out and just slap them up

174
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,280
there, get maybe two bucks off them before the service closes.

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,460
It's not a big deal, but it's no longer a priority.

176
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:56,240
But the reason I bring up Blip is to bring up Maker because I do want to talk about YouTube

177
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,020
MCNs, multi-channel networks, because we have joined one, in fact.

178
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,840
We haven't made any cash on our YouTube channel in about six months.

179
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,440
And for the longest time, the money that we got was from Blip.

180
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,320
In fact, during the heyday of Blip, we were getting about a hundred bucks a month.

181
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,640
Nothing you can live off of, but it paid for props, it paid for anime, it paid for lighting

182
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,360
equipment.

183
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,260
It paid for pretty much everything that the show has right now.

184
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,520
Was that a hundred bucks a month?

185
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:29,200
So recently we kind of had the one-two punch of coming to grips with the fact that we weren't

186
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,960
having any copyright problems with YouTube, but we were placed in a non-trusted state

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,440
where we had to prove that we could monetize every video, even if it would, like, normally

188
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,560
YouTube will allow you to monetize and then let people claim against it.

189
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,180
We got put into a state where we could not monetize without proving it first.

190
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,880
So because of that, we haven't made any money on YouTube recently.

191
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,320
So there was the one-two punch of recognizing that situation as being something we could

192
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,600
no longer handle by ourselves, coupled with the fact that our revenue on Blip between

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,120
December and January dropped from about seventy-five bucks to two bucks.

194
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,680
The fact that Blip is now finally just giving out its last breath, and we realized we had

195
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,160
to, you know, rectify the situation somehow.

196
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Camera's first thought, because she handled most of the multi-channel network stuff that

197
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,060
we ended up doing.

198
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,940
Her first thought was to look into joining Maker.

199
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,540
I mean, it made sense.

200
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,260
We were on Blip TV, we had been kept on through multiple purges.

201
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,100
Maker was turning Blip TV into a Maker-only service.

202
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,500
You know, why not try to get on Maker and be like, hey, can we still use Blip after

203
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
the doors close?

204
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,640
And that was a good idea.

205
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,220
And then, like, somebody from Maker said, yeah, you could do that.

206
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,740
Somebody else from Maker said, well, we have to talk about this first, like, I don't know.

207
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,140
And they kind of gave us the runaround.

208
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,420
We did get a yes, we did get a no, we did get a lot of maybes.

209
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,020
But it was always a, hold on, we'll get back to you, you know, we'll look over the contract

210
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,020
and we'll see if we can fit it in, and we'll do this and that.

211
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,380
And, you know, as we were waiting for them to make up their minds and to finally come

212
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,140
to a decision, because we did hear pretty much every answer under the sun from them,

213
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,540
we sort of realized that, yeah, Blip doesn't matter anymore.

214
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,460
You know, like, assume that we went with Maker and they said, yes, you can stay on Blip.

215
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,020
What will we actually get out of that?

216
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,780
I mean, like I said, Blip is not the place that it used to be.

217
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,420
There was actually a point in time, like I said before, that we actually had a bigger

218
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,380
following on Blip than YouTube.

219
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,500
There was actually a point in time when people visited the Blip main page, the Blip portal,

220
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,260
and discovered new shows.

221
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,860
And people actually got discovered through Blip.

222
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,460
At this point, the main page hasn't been updated in like eight months.

223
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:56,540
Our knee-jerk desire to go with Maker, to stay on Blip, was kind of rooted in more of

224
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,060
like a nostalgia and kind of like a past way of thinking where Blip was actually prominent

225
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,700
and now it's not.

226
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,740
And as they were kind of hemming and hawing over there, we realized that, yeah, it's not

227
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
prominent anymore.

228
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,500
And as soon as Blip was taken out of the equation, we didn't have any specific reason to go with

229
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Maker.

230
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,620
No offense to them, they'll do fine without us.

231
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:28,900
But with Blip out of the picture, the only thing that we needed from an MCN was to solve

232
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,380
our non-trusted state problem, and any MCN can do that.

233
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,460
So at that point, we began looking into other networks.

234
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,620
Heard of Fullscreen, I've heard many terrible things about Fullscreen.

235
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,500
We all unanimously said no to that.

236
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
The same with Curse the Lesso, definitely the same with Machinima.

237
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,460
I've heard stories of people signing up with Machinima and then losing their channels,

238
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,500
like Machinima now owns your brand.

239
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,260
And then we started looking at Screenwave Media, and actually when the three of us sat

240
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,760
down to kind of cast our votes, camera wanted to join Screenwave Media.

241
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,520
It does have some decently big names on it, it also has a few of our internet friends

242
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,180
on it as well, and something that Camera Lady liked was that it had its own proprietary

243
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
media player.

244
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,300
Macau Maker has Blip, Screenwave the network has Screenwave the player.

245
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,780
Now I want to point this out because this is how we're different from a lot of other

246
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
YouTubers.

247
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,780
We don't like having all of our eggs in one basket, we liked uploading to YouTube and

248
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,940
to Blip, so that if one channel got fried, the other one would still exist.

249
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,220
It's always good to have a backup.

250
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,660
You don't want to completely depend on YouTube, even during this era of YouTube dominance,

251
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,500
you don't want to completely depend on it, in my opinion.

252
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,660
And I mean, when we started our channel, YouTube was kind of the place to be to see our content,

253
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,600
and Blip was the backup.

254
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,740
And then as time went on, Blip became the main place to see our content, and YouTube

255
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,720
was our backup, because that's just where the numbers and the money were at the time.

256
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,980
Camera really wanted Screenwave, because Screenwave has that player.

257
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,860
But then Dave and I both told her, you know, if you want to diversify, not have all your

258
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,700
eggs in one basket, this isn't the way to do it.

259
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,460
You know, Screenwave, for as cool as I'm sure they are, if we did that, we would have

260
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,700
our stuff on Screenwave, the media player, and then our stuff on YouTube through Screenwave.

261
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,660
Like, you're not diversifying there.

262
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,900
And ultimately we decided to go with the Freedom Network.

263
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Freedom is not as big as the big three of Machinima, Fullscreen, and Maker.

264
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,620
It's kind of structured a little bit differently.

265
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,580
Freedom is like an overarching network that supports a bunch of smaller networks, all

266
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,580
with their own contracts, and their own rules, and their own leaders, but still ultimately

267
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,360
financially backed by Freedom, at least this is how I think it works.

268
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,380
And the group we ended up joining was called Creator, and Creator is run by Queenie from

269
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,380
Gamergate.

270
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:09,180
And I mean, as soon as we joined Creator and Freedom, I don't exactly know how to parse

271
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,180
the two terms.

272
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,220
We're with both of them, but one's a subset of the other.

273
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,540
But as soon as we joined them, our copyright issues were resolved on YouTube, which is

274
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
great.

275
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,300
That's pretty much the one thing we wanted out of a network, and we got it.

276
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,740
And we do, of course, trust her because she's from Gamergate.

277
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,640
And I think what was most important to me personally is that it was not a lock-in contract.

278
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,680
We can leave their network anytime we want, given them 30 days notice.

279
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,240
It's not like with Maker, where Maker wanted you to stay for two years and then have an

280
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,020
auto-renew contract that you had to fight your way out of.

281
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,560
Because really, we're new to the multi-channel network thing.

282
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,080
We're just sort of experimenting with it right now.

283
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,560
This is no offense to Queenie or Creators if she's watching this, but we don't quite

284
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,480
know how this will play out.

285
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,260
We're just sort of taking it one step at a time and kind of exploring the possibilities.

286
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,560
So it being a first network, it being a trial run for us, and kind of just getting used

287
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,960
to the idea, it is nice that we can leave.

288
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,460
We just sort of want to try this out and see how it goes, and not be with a gigantic penalty

289
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,960
if we decide that MCNs just aren't our thing, or whatever.

290
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
You know?

291
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,980
Basically, it's our first try and we're going it slow.

292
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,860
And I don't think that should reflect poorly on them at all.

293
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,660
If anything, it should reflect poorly on us, because we have no fucking clue what we're

294
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
doing.

295
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,420
What can freedom or creator have to do with the show?

296
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
Nothing.

297
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,900
You're still going to get the content at the same times.

298
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,820
They're just going to give us a hand with some copyright issues, give us a hand with

299
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:50,140
some search engine optimization stuff, and then we'll kind of see how we like the partnership

300
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
and then go from there.

301
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,140
So that's really where we stand right now.

302
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,620
Starting a Patreon, it's got shit rewards, because we're a small channel.

303
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,900
If you want to help out, that's great.

304
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,780
We'll expand things as we go, we'll figure out how it works as we go, and we will prove

305
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,780
to you that your money is not being wasted.

306
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,380
BlipTV is closing.

307
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,460
It makes absolutely no difference to anybody at this point, because BlipTV is archaic and

308
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,740
it's going to be gone.

309
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,780
It's a ghost town, and when it becomes Maker TV, it will be even more of a ghost town.

310
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,940
And the market will adjust.

311
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,380
Someone else will show up with a new video carrier and everyone's going to flock to it

312
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,420
and it's going to be great.

313
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,180
Maybe Daily Motion's going to rise to prominence again.

314
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,100
Maybe Lord Cat's new video startup I hear he's doing will actually become a big thing.

315
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Who knows?

316
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,060
Maybe Vimeo will start allowing ads, though I doubt that'll happen.

317
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,620
However, BlipTV closing means that we join the Freedom multichannel network under Queenie's

318
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,980
creators subnetwork within Freedom.

319
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,340
They've helped us a lot, even though it's only been like a week and they're great, and

320
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,500
it's not going to impede the actual progress of our show, which is what you guys care about

321
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
the most.

322
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,460
I do want to talk a bit about the schedule of those video game episodes.

323
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,980
I'm sure you all have noticed, it's taken us a while to get through games, and part

324
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,300
of that is just due to Dave not playing them very well.

325
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,780
However, a lot of that is because we just have too much on our plate, and we had this

326
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,220
problem a year ago, where a year ago we were posting, we had like six games on the go,

327
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,360
and we posted one part of a game on Monday, one part of the second game on Tuesday, one

328
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,240
part of the third game on Wednesday, and Thursday, Friday, Saturday, then back to Monday

329
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,920
we post the second part of the first game, and then on Tuesday we post the second part

330
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
of the second game.

331
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,240
And we realized really quickly that was kind of ridiculous.

332
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,880
You know, it shouldn't take three months to get through a game, but it did for us because

333
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,000
we were posting one part a week.

334
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,760
So when the summer came along, the summer of 2014, we started posting two videos a day

335
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,360
and we started posting them in large blocks, and we started getting through games that

336
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
way.

337
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,220
But then we basically, we just took on too many games, we started too many games.

338
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,720
Games that we intended to finish, because like, there are certain games that we're obviously

339
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
not going to finish.

340
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,080
Like, we're not going to play like a Mario Party to completion to get 100% in that game,

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
that's ridiculous.

342
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,360
But there are games that we do at least want to beat, if not 100%.

343
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,880
Our internal schedule works like this.

344
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,440
We have a rotation of six games, well five games now, because we just finished Sonic

345
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
and Knuckles.

346
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:24,360
Rogue Legacy, then Super Mario Sunshine, then our Pokemon Soul Silver Ballock run, then

347
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,600
Muramasa the Demon Blade, then Snatcher, and then Sonic and Knuckles.

348
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,280
Now that we just finished Sonic and Knuckles, there's only five games in the rotation.

349
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,040
And basically what we would do is, either camera lady or myself, since I do some editing

350
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,220
now, we would edit up a session of, say, Rogue Legacy.

351
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,220
That would go out.

352
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,900
The accompanying Rogue Legacy would be a session of Super Mario Sunshine.

353
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,140
So that would go out.

354
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,540
Whichever one of those sessions ended first on the release schedule, on the YouTube upload

355
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:04,000
schedule, in that slot would be the session of Pokemon Soul Silver.

356
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,160
And then whatever session ended next, whether that be Sunshine or Soul Silver, then taking

357
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,660
that spot would be Muramasa.

358
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,560
Then whatever session ended next, it would be Snatcher, and then Sonic, and then back

359
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,360
to Rogue Legacy.

360
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,840
Additionally, we have special games.

361
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,040
Skyward Sword is one of those special games, Mario Kart, Smash, anything that requires

362
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:34,440
people more than Dave or I would consider a special game, because Dave and I can film

363
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
this anytime we want.

364
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
We live together.

365
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
We can do it every day of the week if we want.

366
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,040
Getting other people's kind of a task sometimes, and that's not a slight to them, it's just

367
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,340
people have lives.

368
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,580
So whenever we get something from them, we put it up either as soon as possible, or if

369
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,180
it's a holiday show, whenever appropriate.

370
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:00,220
So these two factors combined, the abundance of special games we have on the go, and the

371
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:06,780
random availability of the people involved in them, along with six full-time games, we

372
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,740
were posting twice a day, and we were rotating session to session, not game to game, one

373
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,360
at a time, it was still taking a full month to get back to the next session.

374
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,400
We started posting the first session of Rogue Legacy at the beginning of January, the second

375
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,160
session came out near the end of January.

376
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,280
That's still a bit too inconsistent for my taste, and I'm sure for some of the viewer

377
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
tastes as well.

378
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I'm just assuming.

379
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,720
I mean, I wouldn't want to shoot myself in the foot here, but I wouldn't want to watch

380
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,720
a channel that kept rotating large numbers of games and only getting back to the games

381
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,160
that I liked every once in a while.

382
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,640
So here's what we've decided to do.

383
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,580
The special games will stay the same as they always were.

384
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,720
Whenever they're available, they're available, and that's just how it has to be, because

385
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,180
it involves people other than myself or Dave.

386
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,620
The main games, those five in the rotation now that Sonic's done, we're not starting

387
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,560
any new games until that's cut down to at least two, preferably one.

388
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,960
You know, at the time of filming this, we've completed about two-thirds of Mario Sunshine,

389
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,800
though it hasn't come out yet, but we've completed about two-thirds.

390
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Muramasa is nearly complete, Snatcher is done, it just has to come out, we have to wait for

391
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,440
the schedule to get to it, but we've finished Snatcher.

392
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,120
The two big ones left are Pokemon Soul Silver, which we're just barely halfway through at

393
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,500
this point, and Rogue Legacy, which we're also just barely halfway through at this point.

394
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,840
So before we start any new projects, we're going to start completing some of these games.

395
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,440
And when we get to a point where we only have, say, Rogue Legacy and Pokemon Soul Silver,

396
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,120
because those are two just giant beasts of a game, at that point, maybe we'll start bringing

397
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
in new games.

398
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Because, I mean, I want to start the next Banjo, I also want to start the next Sonic

399
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,060
and kind of get that series back underway.

400
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,860
I know Dave really wants to play Charles Barkley again, and so do I, and we have begun

401
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,360
filming a completely new game unrelated to any old series, but again, we're not going

402
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,500
to release it until we free up some time with the schedule, because it's kind of getting

403
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,060
ridiculous at this point.

404
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,260
So throughout the month of March, we're going to really try and get this stuff done, so

405
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,900
hopefully there'll be space for new games very soon.

406
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,340
And I mean, if he wants to play something, all you have to do is ask, you can't promise

407
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,620
when we'll get around to it, but if we have a copy of it, sure, we'll play it.

408
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,740
The gift rule still applies, where if somebody decides to send us a game, or maybe send us

409
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:45,020
money with the express note attached saying, buy this game with this money, I guess, then

410
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,660
we will put that request at the head of the line.

411
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,940
We will say, you know what, you just gave us something, we're going to do this for you.

412
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,700
You know, because you're being generous, we're going to give you what you want.

413
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,060
You give us an anime, we'll give you a review, it'll be the next thing we do.

414
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,420
You give us a video game, we'll give you a let's play, it'll be the next thing we play.

415
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,060
We've always wanted to reward fans that have decided to give us something, admittedly there

416
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,500
haven't been many over the years, but there have been some, for example, Bible Black happened

417
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,780
because we actually got the DVDs for Bible Black from somebody.

418
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:25,140
So yeah, we did several riffs of that monstrosity because of fans.

419
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,180
And that's our upcoming schedule, you know, whether you donate or not, whether the money

420
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:35,140
works out or not, whether the freedom network works out or not, we are going to try our

421
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:42,980
very hardest for two video game shows a day, one gamergate video a week, two anime reviews

422
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
a month.

423
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,620
I can't guarantee anything, but we are going to try.

424
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,980
And again, no obligation, but the higher that Patreon number goes, the more likely we'll

425
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,300
get it done.

426
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:01,620
And that's not blackmailer me trying to be a money-grubbing jerk, that's just an economic

427
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
fact.

428
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,100
That's just how it is, you know.

429
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,660
The show has grown, and it's grown to the point that either it needs to start funding

430
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:16,620
itself again after BlipTV goes under, or we need to basically cut it out.

431
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,340
And to all of us here, cutting it out is not an option, we love doing this.

432
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:27,500
So if you're still with me, thanks for listening, and let's hope the coming months work out,

433
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,420
in all these endeavours.

434
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,740
Endeavours.
