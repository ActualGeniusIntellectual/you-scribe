00:00.000 --> 00:02.820
Hey guys, Dev here, doing another update vlog for you.

00:02.820 --> 00:06.680
It's March 1st, and I'm gonna go over some changes happening to the channel right now.

00:06.680 --> 00:11.800
I'm sure some of you have noticed that there is now a Patreon link on the end slates of

00:11.800 --> 00:12.800
our Let's Plays.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.600
Yes, we've given in to the dark side and started up a Patreon.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.300
For those of you who don't know, Patreon is a service where you can incrementally pay

00:19.300 --> 00:21.820
your favourite internet content producers.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.720
It's sort of become a big thing recently.

00:23.720 --> 00:28.920
A lot of mid-sized video producers like TheSpoonieOne and such are using it.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.600
It also became a big thing negatively because in Gamergate people discovered that developers

00:34.600 --> 00:37.680
and journalists were donating to each other's Patreons.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.640
And I'm sure we'll have a whole Indiefensible video coming up on that soon.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.040
Patreon is different from something like Indiegogo or Kickstarter.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.420
Indiegogo, Kickstarter, GoFundMe, those type of things, they're to fund a single project.

00:50.420 --> 00:58.640
You know, um, just a famous and controversial example was Anita Sarkeesian getting a boatload

00:58.640 --> 01:00.160
of money to do videos.

01:00.160 --> 01:05.680
Now I'm not here to discuss Anita Sarkeesian at all, that's a topic for another video.

01:05.680 --> 01:13.520
But basically, her campaign was set up like you give her a total sum of money, she creates

01:13.520 --> 01:15.400
a video series.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.880
And that model works for a Kickstarter or for an Indiegogo.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.880
But Patreon's different.

01:20.880 --> 01:28.560
Patreon is an ongoing payment where as people produce the content, you pay them in pieces.

01:28.560 --> 01:34.000
So you know, for example, I think Spoonie's Patreon is set up so that every time he releases

01:34.000 --> 01:37.040
a new review, you're supposed to pay him money.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.560
And that exchange happens automatically.

01:39.560 --> 01:44.800
He puts up a video, he tells Patreon, they withdraw from the account.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.560
Other people's Patreons are set up monthly.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.000
And there has been abuse with this.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.980
Again, in Gamergate, people have discovered that, you know, there are people like Indie

01:53.980 --> 01:58.980
game developers who are just breaking in money through Patreon monthly on a monthly

01:58.980 --> 02:00.500
basis for doing nothing.

02:00.500 --> 02:05.140
And we're not going to be like that because I think anyone who's watched our channel for

02:05.140 --> 02:09.100
any amount of time knows we put out two videos a day.

02:09.100 --> 02:16.220
So our Patreon is going to be a monthly contribution so that you, if you're so inclined, and we

02:16.220 --> 02:20.940
would be very grateful if you were, decide to give us money through Patreon every month

02:20.940 --> 02:26.740
you'd pay so much, we would put that towards the show.

02:26.740 --> 02:30.660
And it makes sense for us because we put out so many videos.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.220
The idea of having you pay for every video is kind of absurd.

02:34.220 --> 02:39.180
And Patreon even suggests that people who put out consistent content like us go buy

02:39.180 --> 02:40.180
a monthly plan.

02:40.180 --> 02:41.180
So that's what we're going to do.

02:41.180 --> 02:45.520
Lord Cat has done some talking about Patreon recently, where he mentioned that a lot of

02:45.520 --> 02:53.040
people who do Patreons set their goals for individual contributors.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.080
They set them kind of stupidly.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.080
And here's what I'll mean.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.760
Like, say you're, I'm just going to use the gamer game example again, because it's what's

03:00.760 --> 03:02.200
on my brain right now.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.200
Say you're an Indie developer, and you have a Patreon.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.480
And one of the goals is, okay, if you donate $50 every month, I'll make you an Indie game.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.200
Okay, great.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.000
So let's say I'm going to invest in that person.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.120
I invest 50 bucks for one month, I get my Indie game.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.480
And what is my incentive to keep giving $50 every month?

03:24.480 --> 03:28.680
That was a one time reward for a monthly contribution.

03:28.680 --> 03:33.520
One time rewards work for things like Kickstarter, wherein you're backing an entire project,

03:33.520 --> 03:38.200
and you get a reward from the project, along with the project itself, but it doesn't work

03:38.200 --> 03:43.520
for an ongoing payment like Patreon, which is why we've actually kind of, over here we've

03:43.520 --> 03:47.280
kind of gone back and forth with the idea of should we do a Kickstarter or something

03:47.280 --> 03:51.740
like that versus should we do a Patreon, we ultimately decided to go with Patreon because

03:51.740 --> 03:57.120
we're not funding a new project per se, you know, our channels already going, the channel

03:57.120 --> 03:59.480
would continue to go.

03:59.480 --> 04:04.220
Even without the money, though, it would probably go worse, but it would continue to go.

04:04.220 --> 04:08.760
It's not it's not like with a Kickstarter where if a Kickstarter fails a project stops,

04:08.760 --> 04:13.320
our channel, even if even if this Patreon idea completely falls apart on us, we're still

04:13.320 --> 04:15.300
going to keep making stuff on our channel.

04:15.300 --> 04:19.640
So here's how our Patreon is going to work.

04:19.640 --> 04:24.200
We're coming up with a mechanism that will allow people to view the daily videos, which

04:24.200 --> 04:26.700
is the Let's Play stuff earlier.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.640
So if you were to contribute not a large amount, probably some small amount, like 10 bucks

04:30.640 --> 04:37.600
or something a month, you could see the videos during that month, probably about a week ahead

04:37.600 --> 04:39.600
of schedule, a week earlier than everyone else.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.680
And that probably sounds pretty weak, admittedly.

04:43.680 --> 04:51.960
But here's the thing, every other good alternative we thought of would have been one time, one

04:51.960 --> 04:54.780
time rewards, which don't fit with a Patreon.

04:54.780 --> 04:59.760
Like if you wanted, okay, if you wanted to donate, say 50 bucks a month, and we do an

04:59.760 --> 05:04.560
anime review for you, okay, after we after you do your review, you know, why would you

05:04.560 --> 05:08.960
keep donating $50 you know, it's kind of ridiculous.

05:08.960 --> 05:15.880
We do have a separate system set up, where if you want to donate a DVD copy of an anime,

05:15.880 --> 05:18.080
then we will do a review of that for you.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.800
And that that's outside of Patreon.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.600
But that is really the only goal we've thought of.

05:22.600 --> 05:27.600
And because we don't expect to get much, admittedly much money from this.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.380
So it's a small goal for a small Patreon.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.940
I think it fits.

05:32.940 --> 05:36.380
It is something that is ongoing and somewhat substantive.

05:36.380 --> 05:40.500
So you would get your $10 worth at least if you like our stuff and want to see it sooner.

05:40.500 --> 05:45.020
And I will promise you that whenever we get money from Patreon and decide to spend that

05:45.020 --> 05:48.180
money on something, it will be towards the show.

05:48.180 --> 05:55.380
We do plan to buy new equipment, to buy some hardware, maybe to buy games or anime to use

05:55.380 --> 06:01.140
on the show, props, lighting, you know, costumes.

06:01.140 --> 06:06.600
And any time we buy something with your money, we will publicly post the receipt so you can

06:06.600 --> 06:08.340
see exactly where it's going.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.440
There will be more details in the Patreon to come.

06:10.440 --> 06:15.740
We're hoping to have it set up by April so that April is when the monthly rewards will

06:15.740 --> 06:16.980
start rolling out.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.040
So in one month.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.880
And with any luck we'll get enough money out of it that we could expand the program, maybe

06:21.880 --> 06:23.680
offer some different rewards.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.800
We do also want to have total sum rewards where if we manage to get, say, X amount of

06:28.800 --> 06:32.800
dollars in total, we could do a certain project.

06:32.800 --> 06:37.920
I know our ultimate goal for this channel is the following.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.960
Two Let's Play videos daily.

06:41.960 --> 06:46.900
One indefensible gamergate video weekly.

06:46.900 --> 06:50.720
Two anime reviews monthly.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.280
And then on top of all that, really anything else that we could throw in.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.800
Like if you wanted to do, if you wanted to like go see a movie and do a vlog about it,

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
we could do that.

06:58.800 --> 07:04.840
If I wanted to finally pick up the slack on doing the Pokemon retrospective, I definitely

07:04.840 --> 07:06.040
want to do that.

07:06.040 --> 07:10.440
And I mean, we're going to try to do that whether we get paid from you guys or not.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.440
This is no pressure.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.440
We're going to try.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.340
We've been trying for a while.

07:15.340 --> 07:16.480
But the money would help.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.760
We could buy things that were missing and so on and so forth.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.040
But I mean, don't, of course, don't feel obligated.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.040
Don't feel obligated.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.120
We're a fucking tiny internet show.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.240
But it would help us with those goals.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.200
It would be appreciated.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.260
You would get at least the meager rewards that we could offer and it would all go towards

07:33.260 --> 07:35.020
the show and you'd see proof of that.

07:35.020 --> 07:39.560
Now on the topic of the end slate, when we put the Patreon link into the end slate, we

07:39.560 --> 07:40.880
took out the BlipTV link.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.760
And I'm going to go over just what's going on there.

07:43.760 --> 07:50.640
I'm sure a lot of you already know this, but basically BlipTV is closing its doors.

07:50.640 --> 07:59.760
And there was a time in which, this was back in 2009, 2008, when actually YouTube didn't

07:59.760 --> 08:01.680
make YouTubers any money.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.240
The money was on BlipTV.

08:04.240 --> 08:10.360
And if you could get on BlipTV and then even better get on a conglomerate site, the big

08:10.360 --> 08:16.680
one back then was that guy with the glasses, you could actually make serious internet money.

08:16.680 --> 08:22.440
Because YouTube back then, in 2009, was considered just a place to kind of build an audience

08:22.440 --> 08:24.200
but not really make money off the audience.

08:24.200 --> 08:29.760
You had to build a YouTube audience, then get accepted on BlipTV.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.520
Even better, get accepted on one of these sites, because Blip paid out significantly

08:33.520 --> 08:35.280
more than YouTube.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.400
And we got lucky.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.400
You know, right during Blip's heyday, August 2009, we got on BlipTV and we started posting

08:41.400 --> 08:46.360
our anime reviews on BlipTV and they started actually getting decent hits and getting money.

08:46.360 --> 08:51.720
And for a good while there, we actually had a bigger following on Blip than we did on

08:51.720 --> 08:52.720
YouTube.

08:52.720 --> 08:57.720
But then I think in like 2012 or something, Maker, the YouTube studio, the network, bought

08:57.720 --> 09:00.080
Blip and it's kind of gone downhill since then.

09:00.080 --> 09:07.960
They started purging people from Blip so that content producers were kicked off, usually

09:07.960 --> 09:11.720
because they didn't meet Blip's standards of quality.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.880
Luckily, we stayed on.

09:13.880 --> 09:14.880
I don't know how.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.880
I mean, there are people there who I think were better than us that got the boot and

09:18.880 --> 09:19.880
we didn't.

09:19.880 --> 09:25.280
And everybody has seen this coming for about a year now because there's been every, between

09:25.280 --> 09:29.520
six and nine months, there's been new cuts of people saying, okay, we're going to tighten

09:29.520 --> 09:33.320
the rules some more, kick more people out, tighten the rules again, kick more people

09:33.320 --> 09:34.320
out.

09:34.320 --> 09:39.280
We've survived each purge from Blip, but it's not the site that it used to be.

09:39.280 --> 09:44.320
It's pretty obvious that when Maker bought Blip, they just kind of wanted the exclusive

09:44.320 --> 09:46.140
talent that was signed to Blip.

09:46.140 --> 09:49.160
There were some contributors on Blip TV that were only on Blip TV.

09:49.160 --> 09:54.480
They had like contracts with Blip that made them exclusive and Maker wanted them.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.680
Maker wanted them on their network, so they bought Blip to get them.

09:56.680 --> 10:02.080
And then after that, Maker really didn't care what happened to Blip.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.440
So the Blip surge has gone down.

10:06.440 --> 10:12.240
The money is back on YouTube again and Blip is ultimately closing its doors and becoming

10:12.240 --> 10:13.240
Maker TV.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.720
And it will be a Maker only service.

10:15.720 --> 10:21.000
And even then, not for everybody on Maker, only for like the privileged few that the

10:21.000 --> 10:24.980
top of Maker will be, will have their videos hosted on Maker TV.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.760
So I mean, we are leaving Blip.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.000
It's not really a priority for us anymore.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.900
It's not a priority for anybody anymore, but it's not really a big deal because Blip's prominence

10:32.900 --> 10:33.900
has faded.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.720
I mean, we'll still upload to Blip like when it's convenient.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.160
I mean, if, for example, no one in the house is using the internet and we got a couple

10:42.160 --> 10:45.400
episodes that we haven't uploaded to Blip yet, we can put out and just slap them up

10:45.400 --> 10:48.280
there, get maybe two bucks off them before the service closes.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.460
It's not a big deal, but it's no longer a priority.

10:50.460 --> 10:56.240
But the reason I bring up Blip is to bring up Maker because I do want to talk about YouTube

10:56.240 --> 11:01.020
MCNs, multi-channel networks, because we have joined one, in fact.

11:01.020 --> 11:05.840
We haven't made any cash on our YouTube channel in about six months.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.440
And for the longest time, the money that we got was from Blip.

11:08.440 --> 11:12.320
In fact, during the heyday of Blip, we were getting about a hundred bucks a month.

11:12.320 --> 11:17.640
Nothing you can live off of, but it paid for props, it paid for anime, it paid for lighting

11:17.640 --> 11:19.360
equipment.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.260
It paid for pretty much everything that the show has right now.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.520
Was that a hundred bucks a month?

11:22.520 --> 11:29.200
So recently we kind of had the one-two punch of coming to grips with the fact that we weren't

11:29.200 --> 11:33.960
having any copyright problems with YouTube, but we were placed in a non-trusted state

11:33.960 --> 11:39.440
where we had to prove that we could monetize every video, even if it would, like, normally

11:39.440 --> 11:44.560
YouTube will allow you to monetize and then let people claim against it.

11:44.560 --> 11:49.180
We got put into a state where we could not monetize without proving it first.

11:49.180 --> 11:52.880
So because of that, we haven't made any money on YouTube recently.

11:52.880 --> 11:58.320
So there was the one-two punch of recognizing that situation as being something we could

11:58.320 --> 12:06.600
no longer handle by ourselves, coupled with the fact that our revenue on Blip between

12:06.600 --> 12:13.120
December and January dropped from about seventy-five bucks to two bucks.

12:13.120 --> 12:18.680
The fact that Blip is now finally just giving out its last breath, and we realized we had

12:18.680 --> 12:21.160
to, you know, rectify the situation somehow.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.800
Camera's first thought, because she handled most of the multi-channel network stuff that

12:25.800 --> 12:27.060
we ended up doing.

12:27.060 --> 12:28.940
Her first thought was to look into joining Maker.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.540
I mean, it made sense.

12:30.540 --> 12:34.260
We were on Blip TV, we had been kept on through multiple purges.

12:34.260 --> 12:37.100
Maker was turning Blip TV into a Maker-only service.

12:37.100 --> 12:42.500
You know, why not try to get on Maker and be like, hey, can we still use Blip after

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
the doors close?

12:43.500 --> 12:46.640
And that was a good idea.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.220
And then, like, somebody from Maker said, yeah, you could do that.

12:49.220 --> 12:53.740
Somebody else from Maker said, well, we have to talk about this first, like, I don't know.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.140
And they kind of gave us the runaround.

12:56.180 --> 12:59.420
We did get a yes, we did get a no, we did get a lot of maybes.

12:59.420 --> 13:03.020
But it was always a, hold on, we'll get back to you, you know, we'll look over the contract

13:03.020 --> 13:06.020
and we'll see if we can fit it in, and we'll do this and that.

13:06.020 --> 13:11.380
And, you know, as we were waiting for them to make up their minds and to finally come

13:11.380 --> 13:17.140
to a decision, because we did hear pretty much every answer under the sun from them,

13:17.140 --> 13:20.540
we sort of realized that, yeah, Blip doesn't matter anymore.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.460
You know, like, assume that we went with Maker and they said, yes, you can stay on Blip.

13:25.460 --> 13:28.020
What will we actually get out of that?

13:28.020 --> 13:30.780
I mean, like I said, Blip is not the place that it used to be.

13:30.780 --> 13:33.420
There was actually a point in time, like I said before, that we actually had a bigger

13:33.420 --> 13:35.380
following on Blip than YouTube.

13:35.380 --> 13:40.500
There was actually a point in time when people visited the Blip main page, the Blip portal,

13:40.500 --> 13:42.260
and discovered new shows.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.860
And people actually got discovered through Blip.

13:44.860 --> 13:48.460
At this point, the main page hasn't been updated in like eight months.

13:48.460 --> 13:56.540
Our knee-jerk desire to go with Maker, to stay on Blip, was kind of rooted in more of

13:56.540 --> 14:02.060
like a nostalgia and kind of like a past way of thinking where Blip was actually prominent

14:02.060 --> 14:03.700
and now it's not.

14:03.700 --> 14:07.740
And as they were kind of hemming and hawing over there, we realized that, yeah, it's not

14:07.740 --> 14:08.740
prominent anymore.

14:08.740 --> 14:15.500
And as soon as Blip was taken out of the equation, we didn't have any specific reason to go with

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
Maker.

14:16.540 --> 14:21.620
No offense to them, they'll do fine without us.

14:21.620 --> 14:28.900
But with Blip out of the picture, the only thing that we needed from an MCN was to solve

14:28.900 --> 14:33.380
our non-trusted state problem, and any MCN can do that.

14:33.380 --> 14:37.460
So at that point, we began looking into other networks.

14:37.460 --> 14:41.620
Heard of Fullscreen, I've heard many terrible things about Fullscreen.

14:41.620 --> 14:44.500
We all unanimously said no to that.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.500
The same with Curse the Lesso, definitely the same with Machinima.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.460
I've heard stories of people signing up with Machinima and then losing their channels,

14:52.460 --> 14:54.500
like Machinima now owns your brand.

14:54.500 --> 14:59.260
And then we started looking at Screenwave Media, and actually when the three of us sat

14:59.260 --> 15:02.760
down to kind of cast our votes, camera wanted to join Screenwave Media.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.520
It does have some decently big names on it, it also has a few of our internet friends

15:06.520 --> 15:12.180
on it as well, and something that Camera Lady liked was that it had its own proprietary

15:12.180 --> 15:13.180
media player.

15:13.180 --> 15:19.300
Macau Maker has Blip, Screenwave the network has Screenwave the player.

15:19.300 --> 15:23.780
Now I want to point this out because this is how we're different from a lot of other

15:23.780 --> 15:24.780
YouTubers.

15:24.780 --> 15:28.780
We don't like having all of our eggs in one basket, we liked uploading to YouTube and

15:28.780 --> 15:33.940
to Blip, so that if one channel got fried, the other one would still exist.

15:33.940 --> 15:36.220
It's always good to have a backup.

15:36.220 --> 15:40.660
You don't want to completely depend on YouTube, even during this era of YouTube dominance,

15:40.660 --> 15:42.500
you don't want to completely depend on it, in my opinion.

15:42.500 --> 15:47.660
And I mean, when we started our channel, YouTube was kind of the place to be to see our content,

15:47.660 --> 15:49.600
and Blip was the backup.

15:49.600 --> 15:54.740
And then as time went on, Blip became the main place to see our content, and YouTube

15:54.740 --> 15:58.720
was our backup, because that's just where the numbers and the money were at the time.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.980
Camera really wanted Screenwave, because Screenwave has that player.

16:02.980 --> 16:07.860
But then Dave and I both told her, you know, if you want to diversify, not have all your

16:07.860 --> 16:10.700
eggs in one basket, this isn't the way to do it.

16:10.700 --> 16:16.460
You know, Screenwave, for as cool as I'm sure they are, if we did that, we would have

16:16.460 --> 16:21.700
our stuff on Screenwave, the media player, and then our stuff on YouTube through Screenwave.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.660
Like, you're not diversifying there.

16:23.660 --> 16:27.900
And ultimately we decided to go with the Freedom Network.

16:27.900 --> 16:37.900
Freedom is not as big as the big three of Machinima, Fullscreen, and Maker.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.620
It's kind of structured a little bit differently.

16:39.820 --> 16:44.580
Freedom is like an overarching network that supports a bunch of smaller networks, all

16:44.580 --> 16:49.580
with their own contracts, and their own rules, and their own leaders, but still ultimately

16:49.580 --> 16:53.360
financially backed by Freedom, at least this is how I think it works.

16:53.360 --> 16:59.380
And the group we ended up joining was called Creator, and Creator is run by Queenie from

16:59.380 --> 17:00.380
Gamergate.

17:00.380 --> 17:09.180
And I mean, as soon as we joined Creator and Freedom, I don't exactly know how to parse

17:09.180 --> 17:10.180
the two terms.

17:10.180 --> 17:13.220
We're with both of them, but one's a subset of the other.

17:13.220 --> 17:17.540
But as soon as we joined them, our copyright issues were resolved on YouTube, which is

17:17.540 --> 17:18.540
great.

17:18.540 --> 17:21.300
That's pretty much the one thing we wanted out of a network, and we got it.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.740
And we do, of course, trust her because she's from Gamergate.

17:24.740 --> 17:30.640
And I think what was most important to me personally is that it was not a lock-in contract.

17:30.640 --> 17:36.680
We can leave their network anytime we want, given them 30 days notice.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.240
It's not like with Maker, where Maker wanted you to stay for two years and then have an

17:40.240 --> 17:43.020
auto-renew contract that you had to fight your way out of.

17:43.020 --> 17:47.560
Because really, we're new to the multi-channel network thing.

17:47.560 --> 17:51.080
We're just sort of experimenting with it right now.

17:51.080 --> 17:56.560
This is no offense to Queenie or Creators if she's watching this, but we don't quite

17:56.560 --> 17:59.480
know how this will play out.

17:59.480 --> 18:04.260
We're just sort of taking it one step at a time and kind of exploring the possibilities.

18:04.260 --> 18:10.560
So it being a first network, it being a trial run for us, and kind of just getting used

18:10.560 --> 18:13.960
to the idea, it is nice that we can leave.

18:13.960 --> 18:18.460
We just sort of want to try this out and see how it goes, and not be with a gigantic penalty

18:18.460 --> 18:21.960
if we decide that MCNs just aren't our thing, or whatever.

18:21.960 --> 18:22.960
You know?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.980
Basically, it's our first try and we're going it slow.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.860
And I don't think that should reflect poorly on them at all.

18:28.860 --> 18:32.660
If anything, it should reflect poorly on us, because we have no fucking clue what we're

18:32.660 --> 18:33.660
doing.

18:34.060 --> 18:36.420
What can freedom or creator have to do with the show?

18:36.420 --> 18:37.420
Nothing.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.900
You're still going to get the content at the same times.

18:39.900 --> 18:42.820
They're just going to give us a hand with some copyright issues, give us a hand with

18:42.820 --> 18:50.140
some search engine optimization stuff, and then we'll kind of see how we like the partnership

18:50.140 --> 18:51.140
and then go from there.

18:51.140 --> 18:54.140
So that's really where we stand right now.

18:54.140 --> 18:58.620
Starting a Patreon, it's got shit rewards, because we're a small channel.

18:58.620 --> 19:01.900
If you want to help out, that's great.

19:01.900 --> 19:06.780
We'll expand things as we go, we'll figure out how it works as we go, and we will prove

19:06.780 --> 19:08.780
to you that your money is not being wasted.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.380
BlipTV is closing.

19:10.380 --> 19:14.460
It makes absolutely no difference to anybody at this point, because BlipTV is archaic and

19:14.460 --> 19:15.740
it's going to be gone.

19:15.740 --> 19:19.780
It's a ghost town, and when it becomes Maker TV, it will be even more of a ghost town.

19:19.780 --> 19:20.940
And the market will adjust.

19:20.940 --> 19:24.380
Someone else will show up with a new video carrier and everyone's going to flock to it

19:24.380 --> 19:25.420
and it's going to be great.

19:25.420 --> 19:28.180
Maybe Daily Motion's going to rise to prominence again.

19:28.180 --> 19:33.100
Maybe Lord Cat's new video startup I hear he's doing will actually become a big thing.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.100
Who knows?

19:34.100 --> 19:37.060
Maybe Vimeo will start allowing ads, though I doubt that'll happen.

19:37.060 --> 19:41.620
However, BlipTV closing means that we join the Freedom multichannel network under Queenie's

19:41.620 --> 19:45.980
creators subnetwork within Freedom.

19:45.980 --> 19:49.340
They've helped us a lot, even though it's only been like a week and they're great, and

19:49.340 --> 19:53.500
it's not going to impede the actual progress of our show, which is what you guys care about

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
the most.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.460
I do want to talk a bit about the schedule of those video game episodes.

19:58.460 --> 20:01.980
I'm sure you all have noticed, it's taken us a while to get through games, and part

20:01.980 --> 20:06.300
of that is just due to Dave not playing them very well.

20:06.300 --> 20:10.780
However, a lot of that is because we just have too much on our plate, and we had this

20:10.780 --> 20:16.220
problem a year ago, where a year ago we were posting, we had like six games on the go,

20:16.220 --> 20:21.360
and we posted one part of a game on Monday, one part of the second game on Tuesday, one

20:21.360 --> 20:26.240
part of the third game on Wednesday, and Thursday, Friday, Saturday, then back to Monday

20:26.240 --> 20:29.920
we post the second part of the first game, and then on Tuesday we post the second part

20:29.920 --> 20:30.920
of the second game.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.240
And we realized really quickly that was kind of ridiculous.

20:33.240 --> 20:38.880
You know, it shouldn't take three months to get through a game, but it did for us because

20:38.880 --> 20:41.000
we were posting one part a week.

20:41.000 --> 20:47.760
So when the summer came along, the summer of 2014, we started posting two videos a day

20:47.760 --> 20:50.360
and we started posting them in large blocks, and we started getting through games that

20:50.360 --> 20:51.360
way.

20:51.360 --> 20:56.220
But then we basically, we just took on too many games, we started too many games.

20:56.220 --> 20:59.720
Games that we intended to finish, because like, there are certain games that we're obviously

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
not going to finish.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.080
Like, we're not going to play like a Mario Party to completion to get 100% in that game,

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
that's ridiculous.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.360
But there are games that we do at least want to beat, if not 100%.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.880
Our internal schedule works like this.

21:10.880 --> 21:16.440
We have a rotation of six games, well five games now, because we just finished Sonic

21:16.440 --> 21:17.440
and Knuckles.

21:17.620 --> 21:24.360
Rogue Legacy, then Super Mario Sunshine, then our Pokemon Soul Silver Ballock run, then

21:24.360 --> 21:29.600
Muramasa the Demon Blade, then Snatcher, and then Sonic and Knuckles.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.280
Now that we just finished Sonic and Knuckles, there's only five games in the rotation.

21:33.280 --> 21:39.040
And basically what we would do is, either camera lady or myself, since I do some editing

21:39.040 --> 21:43.220
now, we would edit up a session of, say, Rogue Legacy.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.220
That would go out.

21:45.220 --> 21:49.900
The accompanying Rogue Legacy would be a session of Super Mario Sunshine.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.140
So that would go out.

21:52.140 --> 21:56.540
Whichever one of those sessions ended first on the release schedule, on the YouTube upload

21:56.540 --> 22:04.000
schedule, in that slot would be the session of Pokemon Soul Silver.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.160
And then whatever session ended next, whether that be Sunshine or Soul Silver, then taking

22:10.160 --> 22:13.660
that spot would be Muramasa.

22:13.660 --> 22:18.560
Then whatever session ended next, it would be Snatcher, and then Sonic, and then back

22:18.560 --> 22:20.360
to Rogue Legacy.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.840
Additionally, we have special games.

22:22.840 --> 22:28.040
Skyward Sword is one of those special games, Mario Kart, Smash, anything that requires

22:28.040 --> 22:34.440
people more than Dave or I would consider a special game, because Dave and I can film

22:34.440 --> 22:35.440
this anytime we want.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.440
We live together.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.440
We can do it every day of the week if we want.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.040
Getting other people's kind of a task sometimes, and that's not a slight to them, it's just

22:43.040 --> 22:45.340
people have lives.

22:45.340 --> 22:51.580
So whenever we get something from them, we put it up either as soon as possible, or if

22:51.580 --> 22:54.180
it's a holiday show, whenever appropriate.

22:54.180 --> 23:00.220
So these two factors combined, the abundance of special games we have on the go, and the

23:00.220 --> 23:06.780
random availability of the people involved in them, along with six full-time games, we

23:06.780 --> 23:11.740
were posting twice a day, and we were rotating session to session, not game to game, one

23:11.740 --> 23:17.360
at a time, it was still taking a full month to get back to the next session.

23:17.360 --> 23:23.400
We started posting the first session of Rogue Legacy at the beginning of January, the second

23:23.400 --> 23:26.160
session came out near the end of January.

23:26.160 --> 23:30.280
That's still a bit too inconsistent for my taste, and I'm sure for some of the viewer

23:30.280 --> 23:31.280
tastes as well.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.280
I'm just assuming.

23:32.280 --> 23:37.720
I mean, I wouldn't want to shoot myself in the foot here, but I wouldn't want to watch

23:37.720 --> 23:41.720
a channel that kept rotating large numbers of games and only getting back to the games

23:41.720 --> 23:44.160
that I liked every once in a while.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.640
So here's what we've decided to do.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.580
The special games will stay the same as they always were.

23:49.580 --> 23:52.720
Whenever they're available, they're available, and that's just how it has to be, because

23:52.720 --> 23:55.180
it involves people other than myself or Dave.

23:55.180 --> 24:01.620
The main games, those five in the rotation now that Sonic's done, we're not starting

24:01.620 --> 24:06.560
any new games until that's cut down to at least two, preferably one.

24:06.560 --> 24:12.960
You know, at the time of filming this, we've completed about two-thirds of Mario Sunshine,

24:12.960 --> 24:16.800
though it hasn't come out yet, but we've completed about two-thirds.

24:16.800 --> 24:21.800
Muramasa is nearly complete, Snatcher is done, it just has to come out, we have to wait for

24:21.800 --> 24:26.440
the schedule to get to it, but we've finished Snatcher.

24:26.440 --> 24:32.120
The two big ones left are Pokemon Soul Silver, which we're just barely halfway through at

24:32.120 --> 24:37.500
this point, and Rogue Legacy, which we're also just barely halfway through at this point.

24:37.500 --> 24:42.840
So before we start any new projects, we're going to start completing some of these games.

24:42.840 --> 24:47.440
And when we get to a point where we only have, say, Rogue Legacy and Pokemon Soul Silver,

24:47.440 --> 24:53.120
because those are two just giant beasts of a game, at that point, maybe we'll start bringing

24:53.120 --> 24:54.120
in new games.

24:54.120 --> 24:58.120
Because, I mean, I want to start the next Banjo, I also want to start the next Sonic

24:58.120 --> 25:00.060
and kind of get that series back underway.

25:00.060 --> 25:04.860
I know Dave really wants to play Charles Barkley again, and so do I, and we have begun

25:04.860 --> 25:09.360
filming a completely new game unrelated to any old series, but again, we're not going

25:09.360 --> 25:14.500
to release it until we free up some time with the schedule, because it's kind of getting

25:14.500 --> 25:16.060
ridiculous at this point.

25:16.060 --> 25:21.260
So throughout the month of March, we're going to really try and get this stuff done, so

25:21.260 --> 25:24.900
hopefully there'll be space for new games very soon.

25:24.900 --> 25:28.340
And I mean, if he wants to play something, all you have to do is ask, you can't promise

25:28.340 --> 25:31.620
when we'll get around to it, but if we have a copy of it, sure, we'll play it.

25:31.620 --> 25:37.740
The gift rule still applies, where if somebody decides to send us a game, or maybe send us

25:37.740 --> 25:45.020
money with the express note attached saying, buy this game with this money, I guess, then

25:45.020 --> 25:48.660
we will put that request at the head of the line.

25:48.660 --> 25:53.940
We will say, you know what, you just gave us something, we're going to do this for you.

25:53.940 --> 25:57.700
You know, because you're being generous, we're going to give you what you want.

25:57.700 --> 26:01.060
You give us an anime, we'll give you a review, it'll be the next thing we do.

26:01.060 --> 26:05.420
You give us a video game, we'll give you a let's play, it'll be the next thing we play.

26:05.420 --> 26:10.060
We've always wanted to reward fans that have decided to give us something, admittedly there

26:10.060 --> 26:15.500
haven't been many over the years, but there have been some, for example, Bible Black happened

26:15.500 --> 26:18.780
because we actually got the DVDs for Bible Black from somebody.

26:18.780 --> 26:25.140
So yeah, we did several riffs of that monstrosity because of fans.

26:25.140 --> 26:29.180
And that's our upcoming schedule, you know, whether you donate or not, whether the money

26:29.180 --> 26:35.140
works out or not, whether the freedom network works out or not, we are going to try our

26:35.140 --> 26:42.980
very hardest for two video game shows a day, one gamergate video a week, two anime reviews

26:42.980 --> 26:43.980
a month.

26:43.980 --> 26:48.620
I can't guarantee anything, but we are going to try.

26:48.620 --> 26:53.980
And again, no obligation, but the higher that Patreon number goes, the more likely we'll

26:53.980 --> 26:55.300
get it done.

26:55.300 --> 27:01.620
And that's not blackmailer me trying to be a money-grubbing jerk, that's just an economic

27:01.620 --> 27:02.620
fact.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.100
That's just how it is, you know.

27:05.100 --> 27:10.660
The show has grown, and it's grown to the point that either it needs to start funding

27:10.660 --> 27:16.620
itself again after BlipTV goes under, or we need to basically cut it out.

27:16.620 --> 27:21.340
And to all of us here, cutting it out is not an option, we love doing this.

27:21.340 --> 27:27.500
So if you're still with me, thanks for listening, and let's hope the coming months work out,

27:27.500 --> 27:29.420
in all these endeavours.

27:29.420 --> 27:31.740
Endeavours.
