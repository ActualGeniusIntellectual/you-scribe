0	8300	It's monkey pox madness time guys, let's go.
8300	11780	Now that nobody cares about COVID anymore, despite some sections of some governments
11780	15360	really trying to remake it a thing, there's got to be something new to scare monger the
15360	16360	people with.
16360	19860	For example, a few weeks back here in Ontario, the provincial government put out the word
19860	24120	that we're in the seventh wave of COVID and that tackling it will require fourth doses
24120	27180	of the vaccine and reinstituting mandatory masking in the fall.
27180	29460	But nobody's listening anymore, everyone's tired of doing it.
29460	33100	They're all panicked out, no one's following along the way they were two years ago.
33100	35860	So instead, in the media, it's all about monkey pox now.
35860	37460	Of course, I'm being a little bit hyperbolic.
37460	41860	Obviously, there are some people out there who view eternal emergencies as a way in which
41860	43440	they can control populations.
43440	46240	That happens and you have to be blind not to see that possibility.
46240	48180	But that's not everybody everywhere.
48180	51380	Sometimes there really is a real problem that needs to be addressed and it's not just a
51380	52380	power grab.
52380	55980	And it does seem to be the case that the monkey pox virus outbreak isn't a hoax or anything
55980	56980	like that.
56980	61860	On May 17, 2022, the CDC expressed concern that monkey pox was spreading undetected in
61860	62860	the UK.
62860	65720	The very next day, the first case had appeared in the United States.
65720	68280	Two days later, it was officially considered an outbreak.
68280	70280	Monkey pox itself is an old virus.
70280	74360	It comes from the smallpox family of viruses, though it's a lot less lethal than its infamous
74360	75360	cousin.
75360	76800	We've known about monkey pox for a while.
76800	79600	There is a vaccine for it, and it's not actually that deadly.
79600	84020	Monkey pox symptoms are a fever, headaches, muscle aches, a lack of energy, and a rash
84020	88720	resembling pus-filled blisters that can develop all over the body, including on the face,
88720	90960	feet, hands, genitals, and inside the mouth.
90960	95000	The rash will typically last two to four weeks, and the timing between the rash and the other
95000	96360	symptoms is varied.
96360	99840	From a layman's perspective, this virus sounds like a more serious version of the chicken
99840	100840	pox.
100840	102040	However, there are key differences.
102040	106280	One is that the chicken pox is relatively mild in children and more serious in adults,
106280	108620	while with monkey pox, it seems to be the other way around.
108620	112240	Another difference is that chicken pox is highly contagious and airborne, while monkey
112240	115140	pox is only spread through close-quarters contact.
115140	118920	Monkey pox is present in bodily fluids, meaning that if you kiss or have sex with somebody
118920	121140	who's infected, chances are you are, too.
121140	126180	It's also possible to inhale respiratory particles from somebody nearby who's sneezed or something.
126180	129860	Additionally, the pus inside the blisters can also transmit the virus.
129860	134260	The mainstream media is heavily de-emphasizing the sexual aspect of the transmission of monkey
134260	135260	pox.
135260	136420	On CNN, for example, it says,
136420	140780	In some cases, during the early stages of illness, the rash has been mostly in the genital
140780	142800	area and perianal area.
142800	147220	In some cases, it has produced anal or genital lesions that look like other diseases like
147220	149220	herpes or chicken pox or syphilis.
149220	154000	A notable fraction of cases in the current outbreak have been seen among gay and bisexual
154000	158220	men, but by no means is the current risk of exposure to monkey pox exclusively to the
158220	160920	gay and bisexual community in the U.S.
160920	163120	Anyone can develop and spread monkey pox.
163120	167160	Overall, monkey pox risk is moderate for people with multiple sexual partners and low for
167160	168360	the broader population.
168360	172020	According to a rapid risk assessment report published Monday by the European Center for
172020	173700	Disease Prevention and Control.
173700	176900	However, monkey pox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease.
176900	179060	I mean, fair enough, right?
179060	181220	There are those other methods of transmission.
181220	185620	HIV is technically not a sexually transmitted disease since you can get it without having
185620	188680	sex even though sex is one of the most common ways that it's spread.
188680	191980	So now we have to ask the question, what's the transmission rate looking like right now?
191980	196860	Well, a study from the New England Journal of Medicine followed 528 monkey pox cases
196860	201760	from 16 different countries and concluded that sex between men is driving the outbreak.
201760	208560	98% of people infected were gay or bi men, 75% of them were white, 41% of them had HIV,
208560	211920	95% of cases are thought to be transmitted during sex.
211920	214280	There's also no women infected yet either.
214280	219040	So uh, those are some pretty damning statistics regarding monkey pox actually being an STD.
219040	223520	I mean, yeah, it could be transmitted nonsexually, sure, but it's not.
223520	224520	At least not right now.
224520	227800	And if anecdotes are more your thing than raw data, that's fine too because a number
227800	231840	of gay men have decided to make the brave decision to step up and tell their story.
231840	234380	Like this guy, a babe the pig boy.
234380	236660	Hi, so I have monkey pox.
236660	240000	I'm not fishing for any sort of sympathy, but since I'm already known for being pretty
240000	243340	unabashed on the internet, I figured I'd give an honest account of how I got it and
243340	246460	how my symptoms manifested to hopefully educate anyone curious.
246460	247460	So strap in.
247460	250540	Jesus Christ, dude, based on your avatar, you're already strapped in.
250680	255380	So I finally got back into the swing of things and attended a friend's birthday orgy.
255380	258800	A friend's birthday orgy on Saturday the 9th.
258800	260080	Is that normal?
260080	261080	Birthday orgies?
261080	264200	I had been watching the news on monkey pox, but the general feelings on it really were
264200	265860	and still are developing by the day.
265860	268320	So I, nor anyone else, were especially worried.
268320	272920	So I attended the orgy, had a great time, guzzled a metric fuckton of human piss.
272920	277480	I think I had sexual contact with around 15 men, similar to the other orgy on Saturday.
280560	284980	Had a great time, met some great people, then stumbled my piss-drunk ass home.
284980	285980	My two cents.
285980	288460	It's reductive to tell gay people not to have sex.
288460	291660	It didn't work in the early days of AIDS and clearly it's not working now.
291660	294040	But do your best to make educated choices.
294040	297900	Check your county's case numbers frequently, and if you can, avoid groups and anonymous
297900	298900	encounters.
298900	304520	I, um, I don't know about you, but drinking piss and fucking 15 men while saying that
304520	307600	nobody else can criticize your lifestyle.
307600	310020	I don't know if this tracks, man.
310020	312580	Or there's this guy whose tale was told in the Guardian.
312580	316660	I literally screamed out loud in pain, my two weeks of monkey pox hell.
316660	320620	When New York pride festivities kicked off on the 24th of June, I was aware that monkey
320620	324060	pox was an emerging issue, especially for gay men, but I was also under the impression
324060	325980	that the number of cases in the city was relatively small.
325980	329060	I had sex with several guys over the weekend.
329060	332720	Then a week later, on the first of July, I started feeling very fatigued.
332720	336820	I had a high fever with chills and muscle aches, and my lymph nodes were so swollen
336820	339340	they were protruding two inches out of my throat.
339340	341220	Next I took a COVID test, negative.
341220	343060	Then I started suspecting monkey pox.
343060	347460	Two days after my symptoms began, the rash started as anal rectal lesions, painful sores
347460	349020	on my anus and rectum.
349020	350620	Initially it was a stinging, itchy feeling.
350620	351920	I wasn't scared at this point.
351920	355340	I was told that it would be mild, and I was a completely healthy individual with no underlying
355340	356340	conditions.
356340	358300	But I had no idea how bad it was going to get.
358300	361300	After I went home, the rash started spreading, and I began to feel anxious.
361300	363340	I developed lesions literally everywhere.
363340	366180	They started looking like mosquito bites before developing into pimply blisters that would
366180	368620	eventually pop, then finally scab and leave a scar.
368900	373340	I had them on my skull, on my face, my arms, my legs, my feet, my hands, my torso, my back,
373340	374680	and five on my right elbow.
374680	379780	At the peak, I had 50 lesions, a fever of 103, and intense pain, prompting a panic attack.
379780	382400	Ironically, the only place I didn't have lesions was my penis.
382400	388660	The next day I got my results, positive for gonorrhea, but no word yet on monkey pox.
388660	392460	That's when I developed hives everywhere on my body from my neck down, as well as a headache,
392460	396500	arthritis pain in my fingers and shoulders, and a strange pain in my shin bone that got
396500	398180	so painful I couldn't stand up.
398180	402460	At night, I would wake up going crazy with both pain and itching from the lesions and
402460	404940	hives, just sitting up in bed and scratching myself.
404940	409000	I was isolated, lonely, and frustrated with how unfair the situation was.
409000	413000	My anal lesions, which were already very painful, turned into open wounds.
413000	417020	It felt like I had three fissures right next to each other, and it was absolutely excruciating.
417020	419620	I would literally scream out loud when I went to the bathroom.
419620	424020	Even keeping the area clean, like washing myself, was extremely painful.
424020	429960	So what kind of activities were you getting up to during New York Pride that you came
429960	435240	out of it with both monkey pox and gonorrhea?
435240	440300	Or there's this fellow, Matt Ford, who's a creative, who acts, writes, and sings, as well
440300	442980	as working for himself as a freelance producer and editor.
442980	447300	He's a proud, openly gay man who splits his time between LA and New York.
447300	451400	Here's what my experience has been like so far, and why you should take it seriously.
451400	455740	Monkey pox seemed like a far-off problem in a vague world of potential inconveniences
455740	457760	eclipsed by bigger social concerns.
457760	460220	On Friday, June 17th, that quickly changed.
460220	463700	I received a call from a friend in LA who informed me that he had tested positive for
463700	468360	monkey pox and that I might have been exposed the weekend prior via skin-to-skin contact.
468360	471520	Sure enough, I checked myself for spots and noticed a couple of lesions in the underwear
471520	472520	zone.
472520	473880	You were having skin-to-skin contact with this guy?
473880	475840	You could just say that you fucked him, it's okay.
475840	479480	On Monday, June 20th, I went to the doctor, and they took a culture swab that was sent
479480	481400	to the LA County Department of Public Health.
481400	483600	They told me the following Thursday what I already knew.
483600	484600	It was positive.
484600	486240	Meanwhile, my symptoms intensified.
486240	489560	The lesions were becoming more intense and quite painful, to the point that I couldn't
489560	490560	sleep some nights.
490560	492120	They were filled with pus and became itchy.
492120	496120	To date, I have counted more than 25 and they're all over, on my arms, legs, hands, feet.
496120	498160	The flu-like symptoms abated slowly.
498160	502160	By Friday, a week after I'd first detected lesions, I felt mostly normal, at least besides
502160	503520	the lesions, which continued to appear.
503520	505080	Thankfully, I'm feeling much better.
505080	508840	While men who have sex with men currently make up the majority of cases, anyone can
508840	513440	get monkey pox, it is not a gay disease, and that is a fact that bears repeating to
513440	515480	tamp down the potential for stigma.
515480	521520	This is technically correct, yes, but a lot of these horrifying stories do, in fact, seem
521520	524760	to boil down to the choices of the men who get infected.
524760	528240	You know, guys, you don't actually have to go out to the pride parade and drink the piss
528240	529680	of 15 dudes, right?
529680	532060	Nobody's holding a gun to your head and asking you to do this.
532060	535920	You could just be normal, and by be normal, I don't mean be straight, because it's not
535920	538900	actually the LGBT community that's being affected by this.
538900	541360	No L's have this problem, no women at all, in fact.
541360	544040	No monogamous gay or bi people are having any issues either.
544040	545760	Trans people seem to be largely unaffected as well.
545760	549240	As far as I can tell, only one trans man has had monkey pox.
549240	551360	This isn't even a broader gay thing.
551360	555580	This is a specific type of highly promiscuous gay man who is disproportionately affected
555580	556840	by the monkey pox outbreak.
556840	558340	But nobody wants to hear that.
558340	561800	Nobody wants to hear that consequences are the result of your own bad choices, or that
561800	564900	this isn't somehow an attack on gays as a class.
564900	568620	That sentiment, by the way, is where we get headlines like, the Tory government is failing
568620	571020	queer men as monkey pox cases surge.
571020	574780	What exactly does Pink News want conservatives to do to fix this failing?
574780	576220	Force the gays back in the closet?
576220	580960	I mean, you don't accept, hey, maybe don't have giant barrels of gay semen poured into
580960	585340	your funneled out asshole as a solution here, so what else are conservatives meant to do?
585340	587380	Also it's not just conservatives.
587380	592820	California's LGBTQ community is feeling ignored, angry, confused as monkey pox cases rise.
592820	596140	The most left leaning government in the United States is apparently at fault too.
596140	597940	So the issue is just government, I guess.
597940	601460	It's the government's fault that you took a load of monkey pox pus into your asshole.
601460	602620	No, no, no, no.
602620	606140	The issue here is that these people are so dependent on the structures of the state to
606140	610520	do everything for them that when big daddy government can't save them with some new program
610520	613220	or initiative or whatever, they feel left out to dry.
613220	616540	They have no conception of being responsible for the quality of their own lives.
616540	618700	It's like that LinkedIn chick I talked about earlier.
618700	623080	These people are like pets of the state that are groomed and cared for and aren't used
623080	627100	to the idea that they may need to be proactive at some point or act in some sort of preventative
627100	628100	manner.
628100	630920	They reject the idea that adopting good habits can solve this problem.
630920	634980	They only accept treatment of the symptoms of their vices after the fact.
634980	638300	Y'all, please look at the requirements of the monkey pox vaccine.
638300	641780	People who meet all of the following criteria are eligible to be vaccinated.
641780	646580	You're a gay, a bisexual or other man who has sex with men and or are transgender, gender
646580	648460	nonconforming or gender nonbinary.
648460	653560	You're age 18 or older and you've had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the last 14 days.
653560	656680	If you do not meet these criteria, please do not make an appointment as you are not
656680	658560	eligible to be vaccinated at this time.
658560	661700	This person, by the way, is a progressive who is complaining that the vaccine specifically
661700	665080	singles out gay men and that it's homophobic of the government to do so.
665080	668940	This is like the inverse of religious fundamentalists back in the 1980s pretending that AIDS isn't
668940	670680	a problem because they're homophobic.
670680	673100	These guys want to pretend that monkey pox isn't a problem because they're woke.
673100	677300	Prioritizing the most at risk group of people for vaccines is how this kind of thing should
677300	678300	be done.
678340	682420	Most complaints that it spreads negative stereotypes about the gay community are fucking retarded.
682420	687260	This is when you're so woke that you would rather gay degenerates die of their degeneracy
687260	688340	before treating them.
688340	689340	Jesus Christ.
689340	693900	And of course, to top it off, there's that one article from the most recent weekly sip.
693900	699700	US records first two child monkey pox cases, California toddler and an infant in D.C. were
699700	705380	both likely infected by household contacts and both had contact with gay or bisexual
705380	706380	men.
706380	708060	Now, listen, I know what you're all thinking.
708060	710100	I remember the statistics from earlier, too.
710100	715120	98% of people infected were gay or bi men, 95% of people caught it through sex.
715120	719520	It's entirely possible these kids caught it through one of those non-sexual methods.
719520	725180	But maybe we should just look into this a little bit, you know, just in case, like,
725180	729540	you know, hypothetically speaking here, if you find semen inside of a child's asshole,
729540	733860	perhaps the first order of business is to forget about how homophobic it sounds to ask
733860	735860	how it fucking got there.
735860	739420	Maybe we should be worried a bit less about the stigma, CDC.
739420	741300	Maybe that shouldn't be the priority here.
741300	743780	Like I said before, this isn't a gay problem.
743780	745000	This is a degenerate problem.
745000	749460	A gay couple living in a closed, monogamous gay marriage, living a normal life.
749460	752620	They have nothing to fear from the monkey pox outbreak and neither do the overwhelming
752620	754180	majority of the rest of us.
754180	757480	If anything, this situation has made me more pro gay marriage than before.
757480	759380	Maybe gay marriage should be mandatory.
759380	762220	No gay sex unless you're married, if this is what you're going to do with it.
762220	764460	But yeah, this is not a pandemic situation.
764460	767780	COVID was like a medium on the bad scale, and this is nowhere near that.
767780	770220	If anyone tries to tell you that you can't go to work, you need to stay indoors because
770220	773420	of monkey pox, just reassure them that, hey, I'm not a degenerate.
773420	774780	It'll be okay.
774780	777740	How to not get monkey pox.
777740	789140	Step one, don't be a hoe.
789140	790260	Thank you for watching.
