00:00.000 --> 00:08.300
It's monkey pox madness time guys, let's go.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.780
Now that nobody cares about COVID anymore, despite some sections of some governments

00:11.780 --> 00:15.360
really trying to remake it a thing, there's got to be something new to scare monger the

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
people with.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.860
For example, a few weeks back here in Ontario, the provincial government put out the word

00:19.860 --> 00:24.120
that we're in the seventh wave of COVID and that tackling it will require fourth doses

00:24.120 --> 00:27.180
of the vaccine and reinstituting mandatory masking in the fall.

00:27.180 --> 00:29.460
But nobody's listening anymore, everyone's tired of doing it.

00:29.460 --> 00:33.100
They're all panicked out, no one's following along the way they were two years ago.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.860
So instead, in the media, it's all about monkey pox now.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.460
Of course, I'm being a little bit hyperbolic.

00:37.460 --> 00:41.860
Obviously, there are some people out there who view eternal emergencies as a way in which

00:41.860 --> 00:43.440
they can control populations.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.240
That happens and you have to be blind not to see that possibility.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.180
But that's not everybody everywhere.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.380
Sometimes there really is a real problem that needs to be addressed and it's not just a

00:51.380 --> 00:52.380
power grab.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.980
And it does seem to be the case that the monkey pox virus outbreak isn't a hoax or anything

00:55.980 --> 00:56.980
like that.

00:56.980 --> 01:01.860
On May 17, 2022, the CDC expressed concern that monkey pox was spreading undetected in

01:01.860 --> 01:02.860
the UK.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.720
The very next day, the first case had appeared in the United States.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.280
Two days later, it was officially considered an outbreak.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.280
Monkey pox itself is an old virus.

01:10.280 --> 01:14.360
It comes from the smallpox family of viruses, though it's a lot less lethal than its infamous

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
cousin.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.800
We've known about monkey pox for a while.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.600
There is a vaccine for it, and it's not actually that deadly.

01:19.600 --> 01:24.020
Monkey pox symptoms are a fever, headaches, muscle aches, a lack of energy, and a rash

01:24.020 --> 01:28.720
resembling pus-filled blisters that can develop all over the body, including on the face,

01:28.720 --> 01:30.960
feet, hands, genitals, and inside the mouth.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.000
The rash will typically last two to four weeks, and the timing between the rash and the other

01:35.000 --> 01:36.360
symptoms is varied.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.840
From a layman's perspective, this virus sounds like a more serious version of the chicken

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
pox.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.040
However, there are key differences.

01:42.040 --> 01:46.280
One is that the chicken pox is relatively mild in children and more serious in adults,

01:46.280 --> 01:48.620
while with monkey pox, it seems to be the other way around.

01:48.620 --> 01:52.240
Another difference is that chicken pox is highly contagious and airborne, while monkey

01:52.240 --> 01:55.140
pox is only spread through close-quarters contact.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.920
Monkey pox is present in bodily fluids, meaning that if you kiss or have sex with somebody

01:58.920 --> 02:01.140
who's infected, chances are you are, too.

02:01.140 --> 02:06.180
It's also possible to inhale respiratory particles from somebody nearby who's sneezed or something.

02:06.180 --> 02:09.860
Additionally, the pus inside the blisters can also transmit the virus.

02:09.860 --> 02:14.260
The mainstream media is heavily de-emphasizing the sexual aspect of the transmission of monkey

02:14.260 --> 02:15.260
pox.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.420
On CNN, for example, it says,

02:16.420 --> 02:20.780
In some cases, during the early stages of illness, the rash has been mostly in the genital

02:20.780 --> 02:22.800
area and perianal area.

02:22.800 --> 02:27.220
In some cases, it has produced anal or genital lesions that look like other diseases like

02:27.220 --> 02:29.220
herpes or chicken pox or syphilis.

02:29.220 --> 02:34.000
A notable fraction of cases in the current outbreak have been seen among gay and bisexual

02:34.000 --> 02:38.220
men, but by no means is the current risk of exposure to monkey pox exclusively to the

02:38.220 --> 02:40.920
gay and bisexual community in the U.S.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.120
Anyone can develop and spread monkey pox.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.160
Overall, monkey pox risk is moderate for people with multiple sexual partners and low for

02:47.160 --> 02:48.360
the broader population.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.020
According to a rapid risk assessment report published Monday by the European Center for

02:52.020 --> 02:53.700
Disease Prevention and Control.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.900
However, monkey pox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.060
I mean, fair enough, right?

02:59.060 --> 03:01.220
There are those other methods of transmission.

03:01.220 --> 03:05.620
HIV is technically not a sexually transmitted disease since you can get it without having

03:05.620 --> 03:08.680
sex even though sex is one of the most common ways that it's spread.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.980
So now we have to ask the question, what's the transmission rate looking like right now?

03:11.980 --> 03:16.860
Well, a study from the New England Journal of Medicine followed 528 monkey pox cases

03:16.860 --> 03:21.760
from 16 different countries and concluded that sex between men is driving the outbreak.

03:21.760 --> 03:28.560
98% of people infected were gay or bi men, 75% of them were white, 41% of them had HIV,

03:28.560 --> 03:31.920
95% of cases are thought to be transmitted during sex.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.280
There's also no women infected yet either.

03:34.280 --> 03:39.040
So uh, those are some pretty damning statistics regarding monkey pox actually being an STD.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.520
I mean, yeah, it could be transmitted nonsexually, sure, but it's not.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
At least not right now.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.800
And if anecdotes are more your thing than raw data, that's fine too because a number

03:47.800 --> 03:51.840
of gay men have decided to make the brave decision to step up and tell their story.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.380
Like this guy, a babe the pig boy.

03:54.380 --> 03:56.660
Hi, so I have monkey pox.

03:56.660 --> 04:00.000
I'm not fishing for any sort of sympathy, but since I'm already known for being pretty

04:00.000 --> 04:03.340
unabashed on the internet, I figured I'd give an honest account of how I got it and

04:03.340 --> 04:06.460
how my symptoms manifested to hopefully educate anyone curious.

04:06.460 --> 04:07.460
So strap in.

04:07.460 --> 04:10.540
Jesus Christ, dude, based on your avatar, you're already strapped in.

04:10.680 --> 04:15.380
So I finally got back into the swing of things and attended a friend's birthday orgy.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.800
A friend's birthday orgy on Saturday the 9th.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.080
Is that normal?

04:20.080 --> 04:21.080
Birthday orgies?

04:21.080 --> 04:24.200
I had been watching the news on monkey pox, but the general feelings on it really were

04:24.200 --> 04:25.860
and still are developing by the day.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.320
So I, nor anyone else, were especially worried.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.920
So I attended the orgy, had a great time, guzzled a metric fuckton of human piss.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.480
I think I had sexual contact with around 15 men, similar to the other orgy on Saturday.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.980
Had a great time, met some great people, then stumbled my piss-drunk ass home.

04:44.980 --> 04:45.980
My two cents.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.460
It's reductive to tell gay people not to have sex.

04:48.460 --> 04:51.660
It didn't work in the early days of AIDS and clearly it's not working now.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.040
But do your best to make educated choices.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.900
Check your county's case numbers frequently, and if you can, avoid groups and anonymous

04:57.900 --> 04:58.900
encounters.

04:58.900 --> 05:04.520
I, um, I don't know about you, but drinking piss and fucking 15 men while saying that

05:04.520 --> 05:07.600
nobody else can criticize your lifestyle.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.020
I don't know if this tracks, man.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.580
Or there's this guy whose tale was told in the Guardian.

05:12.580 --> 05:16.660
I literally screamed out loud in pain, my two weeks of monkey pox hell.

05:16.660 --> 05:20.620
When New York pride festivities kicked off on the 24th of June, I was aware that monkey

05:20.620 --> 05:24.060
pox was an emerging issue, especially for gay men, but I was also under the impression

05:24.060 --> 05:25.980
that the number of cases in the city was relatively small.

05:25.980 --> 05:29.060
I had sex with several guys over the weekend.

05:29.060 --> 05:32.720
Then a week later, on the first of July, I started feeling very fatigued.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.820
I had a high fever with chills and muscle aches, and my lymph nodes were so swollen

05:36.820 --> 05:39.340
they were protruding two inches out of my throat.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.220
Next I took a COVID test, negative.

05:41.220 --> 05:43.060
Then I started suspecting monkey pox.

05:43.060 --> 05:47.460
Two days after my symptoms began, the rash started as anal rectal lesions, painful sores

05:47.460 --> 05:49.020
on my anus and rectum.

05:49.020 --> 05:50.620
Initially it was a stinging, itchy feeling.

05:50.620 --> 05:51.920
I wasn't scared at this point.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.340
I was told that it would be mild, and I was a completely healthy individual with no underlying

05:55.340 --> 05:56.340
conditions.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.300
But I had no idea how bad it was going to get.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.300
After I went home, the rash started spreading, and I began to feel anxious.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.340
I developed lesions literally everywhere.

06:03.340 --> 06:06.180
They started looking like mosquito bites before developing into pimply blisters that would

06:06.180 --> 06:08.620
eventually pop, then finally scab and leave a scar.

06:08.900 --> 06:13.340
I had them on my skull, on my face, my arms, my legs, my feet, my hands, my torso, my back,

06:13.340 --> 06:14.680
and five on my right elbow.

06:14.680 --> 06:19.780
At the peak, I had 50 lesions, a fever of 103, and intense pain, prompting a panic attack.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.400
Ironically, the only place I didn't have lesions was my penis.

06:22.400 --> 06:28.660
The next day I got my results, positive for gonorrhea, but no word yet on monkey pox.

06:28.660 --> 06:32.460
That's when I developed hives everywhere on my body from my neck down, as well as a headache,

06:32.460 --> 06:36.500
arthritis pain in my fingers and shoulders, and a strange pain in my shin bone that got

06:36.500 --> 06:38.180
so painful I couldn't stand up.

06:38.180 --> 06:42.460
At night, I would wake up going crazy with both pain and itching from the lesions and

06:42.460 --> 06:44.940
hives, just sitting up in bed and scratching myself.

06:44.940 --> 06:49.000
I was isolated, lonely, and frustrated with how unfair the situation was.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
My anal lesions, which were already very painful, turned into open wounds.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.020
It felt like I had three fissures right next to each other, and it was absolutely excruciating.

06:57.020 --> 06:59.620
I would literally scream out loud when I went to the bathroom.

06:59.620 --> 07:04.020
Even keeping the area clean, like washing myself, was extremely painful.

07:04.020 --> 07:09.960
So what kind of activities were you getting up to during New York Pride that you came

07:09.960 --> 07:15.240
out of it with both monkey pox and gonorrhea?

07:15.240 --> 07:20.300
Or there's this fellow, Matt Ford, who's a creative, who acts, writes, and sings, as well

07:20.300 --> 07:22.980
as working for himself as a freelance producer and editor.

07:22.980 --> 07:27.300
He's a proud, openly gay man who splits his time between LA and New York.

07:27.300 --> 07:31.400
Here's what my experience has been like so far, and why you should take it seriously.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.740
Monkey pox seemed like a far-off problem in a vague world of potential inconveniences

07:35.740 --> 07:37.760
eclipsed by bigger social concerns.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.220
On Friday, June 17th, that quickly changed.

07:40.220 --> 07:43.700
I received a call from a friend in LA who informed me that he had tested positive for

07:43.700 --> 07:48.360
monkey pox and that I might have been exposed the weekend prior via skin-to-skin contact.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.520
Sure enough, I checked myself for spots and noticed a couple of lesions in the underwear

07:51.520 --> 07:52.520
zone.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.880
You were having skin-to-skin contact with this guy?

07:53.880 --> 07:55.840
You could just say that you fucked him, it's okay.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.480
On Monday, June 20th, I went to the doctor, and they took a culture swab that was sent

07:59.480 --> 08:01.400
to the LA County Department of Public Health.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.600
They told me the following Thursday what I already knew.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.600
It was positive.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.240
Meanwhile, my symptoms intensified.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.560
The lesions were becoming more intense and quite painful, to the point that I couldn't

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
sleep some nights.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.120
They were filled with pus and became itchy.

08:12.120 --> 08:16.120
To date, I have counted more than 25 and they're all over, on my arms, legs, hands, feet.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.160
The flu-like symptoms abated slowly.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.160
By Friday, a week after I'd first detected lesions, I felt mostly normal, at least besides

08:22.160 --> 08:23.520
the lesions, which continued to appear.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.080
Thankfully, I'm feeling much better.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.840
While men who have sex with men currently make up the majority of cases, anyone can

08:28.840 --> 08:33.440
get monkey pox, it is not a gay disease, and that is a fact that bears repeating to

08:33.440 --> 08:35.480
tamp down the potential for stigma.

08:35.480 --> 08:41.520
This is technically correct, yes, but a lot of these horrifying stories do, in fact, seem

08:41.520 --> 08:44.760
to boil down to the choices of the men who get infected.

08:44.760 --> 08:48.240
You know, guys, you don't actually have to go out to the pride parade and drink the piss

08:48.240 --> 08:49.680
of 15 dudes, right?

08:49.680 --> 08:52.060
Nobody's holding a gun to your head and asking you to do this.

08:52.060 --> 08:55.920
You could just be normal, and by be normal, I don't mean be straight, because it's not

08:55.920 --> 08:58.900
actually the LGBT community that's being affected by this.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.360
No L's have this problem, no women at all, in fact.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.040
No monogamous gay or bi people are having any issues either.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.760
Trans people seem to be largely unaffected as well.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.240
As far as I can tell, only one trans man has had monkey pox.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.360
This isn't even a broader gay thing.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.580
This is a specific type of highly promiscuous gay man who is disproportionately affected

09:15.580 --> 09:16.840
by the monkey pox outbreak.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.340
But nobody wants to hear that.

09:18.340 --> 09:21.800
Nobody wants to hear that consequences are the result of your own bad choices, or that

09:21.800 --> 09:24.900
this isn't somehow an attack on gays as a class.

09:24.900 --> 09:28.620
That sentiment, by the way, is where we get headlines like, the Tory government is failing

09:28.620 --> 09:31.020
queer men as monkey pox cases surge.

09:31.020 --> 09:34.780
What exactly does Pink News want conservatives to do to fix this failing?

09:34.780 --> 09:36.220
Force the gays back in the closet?

09:36.220 --> 09:40.960
I mean, you don't accept, hey, maybe don't have giant barrels of gay semen poured into

09:40.960 --> 09:45.340
your funneled out asshole as a solution here, so what else are conservatives meant to do?

09:45.340 --> 09:47.380
Also it's not just conservatives.

09:47.380 --> 09:52.820
California's LGBTQ community is feeling ignored, angry, confused as monkey pox cases rise.

09:52.820 --> 09:56.140
The most left leaning government in the United States is apparently at fault too.

09:56.140 --> 09:57.940
So the issue is just government, I guess.

09:57.940 --> 10:01.460
It's the government's fault that you took a load of monkey pox pus into your asshole.

10:01.460 --> 10:02.620
No, no, no, no.

10:02.620 --> 10:06.140
The issue here is that these people are so dependent on the structures of the state to

10:06.140 --> 10:10.520
do everything for them that when big daddy government can't save them with some new program

10:10.520 --> 10:13.220
or initiative or whatever, they feel left out to dry.

10:13.220 --> 10:16.540
They have no conception of being responsible for the quality of their own lives.

10:16.540 --> 10:18.700
It's like that LinkedIn chick I talked about earlier.

10:18.700 --> 10:23.080
These people are like pets of the state that are groomed and cared for and aren't used

10:23.080 --> 10:27.100
to the idea that they may need to be proactive at some point or act in some sort of preventative

10:27.100 --> 10:28.100
manner.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.920
They reject the idea that adopting good habits can solve this problem.

10:30.920 --> 10:34.980
They only accept treatment of the symptoms of their vices after the fact.

10:34.980 --> 10:38.300
Y'all, please look at the requirements of the monkey pox vaccine.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.780
People who meet all of the following criteria are eligible to be vaccinated.

10:41.780 --> 10:46.580
You're a gay, a bisexual or other man who has sex with men and or are transgender, gender

10:46.580 --> 10:48.460
nonconforming or gender nonbinary.

10:48.460 --> 10:53.560
You're age 18 or older and you've had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the last 14 days.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.680
If you do not meet these criteria, please do not make an appointment as you are not

10:56.680 --> 10:58.560
eligible to be vaccinated at this time.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.700
This person, by the way, is a progressive who is complaining that the vaccine specifically

11:01.700 --> 11:05.080
singles out gay men and that it's homophobic of the government to do so.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.940
This is like the inverse of religious fundamentalists back in the 1980s pretending that AIDS isn't

11:08.940 --> 11:10.680
a problem because they're homophobic.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.100
These guys want to pretend that monkey pox isn't a problem because they're woke.

11:13.100 --> 11:17.300
Prioritizing the most at risk group of people for vaccines is how this kind of thing should

11:17.300 --> 11:18.300
be done.

11:18.340 --> 11:22.420
Most complaints that it spreads negative stereotypes about the gay community are fucking retarded.

11:22.420 --> 11:27.260
This is when you're so woke that you would rather gay degenerates die of their degeneracy

11:27.260 --> 11:28.340
before treating them.

11:28.340 --> 11:29.340
Jesus Christ.

11:29.340 --> 11:33.900
And of course, to top it off, there's that one article from the most recent weekly sip.

11:33.900 --> 11:39.700
US records first two child monkey pox cases, California toddler and an infant in D.C. were

11:39.700 --> 11:45.380
both likely infected by household contacts and both had contact with gay or bisexual

11:45.380 --> 11:46.380
men.

11:46.380 --> 11:48.060
Now, listen, I know what you're all thinking.

11:48.060 --> 11:50.100
I remember the statistics from earlier, too.

11:50.100 --> 11:55.120
98% of people infected were gay or bi men, 95% of people caught it through sex.

11:55.120 --> 11:59.520
It's entirely possible these kids caught it through one of those non-sexual methods.

11:59.520 --> 12:05.180
But maybe we should just look into this a little bit, you know, just in case, like,

12:05.180 --> 12:09.540
you know, hypothetically speaking here, if you find semen inside of a child's asshole,

12:09.540 --> 12:13.860
perhaps the first order of business is to forget about how homophobic it sounds to ask

12:13.860 --> 12:15.860
how it fucking got there.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.420
Maybe we should be worried a bit less about the stigma, CDC.

12:19.420 --> 12:21.300
Maybe that shouldn't be the priority here.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.780
Like I said before, this isn't a gay problem.

12:23.780 --> 12:25.000
This is a degenerate problem.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.460
A gay couple living in a closed, monogamous gay marriage, living a normal life.

12:29.460 --> 12:32.620
They have nothing to fear from the monkey pox outbreak and neither do the overwhelming

12:32.620 --> 12:34.180
majority of the rest of us.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.480
If anything, this situation has made me more pro gay marriage than before.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.380
Maybe gay marriage should be mandatory.

12:39.380 --> 12:42.220
No gay sex unless you're married, if this is what you're going to do with it.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.460
But yeah, this is not a pandemic situation.

12:44.460 --> 12:47.780
COVID was like a medium on the bad scale, and this is nowhere near that.

12:47.780 --> 12:50.220
If anyone tries to tell you that you can't go to work, you need to stay indoors because

12:50.220 --> 12:53.420
of monkey pox, just reassure them that, hey, I'm not a degenerate.

12:53.420 --> 12:54.780
It'll be okay.

12:54.780 --> 12:57.740
How to not get monkey pox.

12:57.740 --> 13:09.140
Step one, don't be a hoe.

13:09.140 --> 13:10.260
Thank you for watching.
