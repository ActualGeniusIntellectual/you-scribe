1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
It's monkey pox madness time guys, let's go.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,780
Now that nobody cares about COVID anymore, despite some sections of some governments

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,360
really trying to remake it a thing, there's got to be something new to scare monger the

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
people with.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,860
For example, a few weeks back here in Ontario, the provincial government put out the word

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,120
that we're in the seventh wave of COVID and that tackling it will require fourth doses

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,180
of the vaccine and reinstituting mandatory masking in the fall.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,460
But nobody's listening anymore, everyone's tired of doing it.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,100
They're all panicked out, no one's following along the way they were two years ago.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,860
So instead, in the media, it's all about monkey pox now.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,460
Of course, I'm being a little bit hyperbolic.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,860
Obviously, there are some people out there who view eternal emergencies as a way in which

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,440
they can control populations.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,240
That happens and you have to be blind not to see that possibility.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,180
But that's not everybody everywhere.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,380
Sometimes there really is a real problem that needs to be addressed and it's not just a

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,380
power grab.

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,980
And it does seem to be the case that the monkey pox virus outbreak isn't a hoax or anything

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,980
like that.

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,860
On May 17, 2022, the CDC expressed concern that monkey pox was spreading undetected in

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,860
the UK.

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,720
The very next day, the first case had appeared in the United States.

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,280
Two days later, it was officially considered an outbreak.

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,280
Monkey pox itself is an old virus.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,360
It comes from the smallpox family of viruses, though it's a lot less lethal than its infamous

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
cousin.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,800
We've known about monkey pox for a while.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,600
There is a vaccine for it, and it's not actually that deadly.

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,020
Monkey pox symptoms are a fever, headaches, muscle aches, a lack of energy, and a rash

30
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,720
resembling pus-filled blisters that can develop all over the body, including on the face,

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
feet, hands, genitals, and inside the mouth.

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,000
The rash will typically last two to four weeks, and the timing between the rash and the other

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,360
symptoms is varied.

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,840
From a layman's perspective, this virus sounds like a more serious version of the chicken

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
pox.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,040
However, there are key differences.

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,280
One is that the chicken pox is relatively mild in children and more serious in adults,

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,620
while with monkey pox, it seems to be the other way around.

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,240
Another difference is that chicken pox is highly contagious and airborne, while monkey

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,140
pox is only spread through close-quarters contact.

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,920
Monkey pox is present in bodily fluids, meaning that if you kiss or have sex with somebody

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,140
who's infected, chances are you are, too.

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,180
It's also possible to inhale respiratory particles from somebody nearby who's sneezed or something.

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,860
Additionally, the pus inside the blisters can also transmit the virus.

45
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,260
The mainstream media is heavily de-emphasizing the sexual aspect of the transmission of monkey

46
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,260
pox.

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,420
On CNN, for example, it says,

48
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,780
In some cases, during the early stages of illness, the rash has been mostly in the genital

49
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,800
area and perianal area.

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,220
In some cases, it has produced anal or genital lesions that look like other diseases like

51
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,220
herpes or chicken pox or syphilis.

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,000
A notable fraction of cases in the current outbreak have been seen among gay and bisexual

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,220
men, but by no means is the current risk of exposure to monkey pox exclusively to the

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,920
gay and bisexual community in the U.S.

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,120
Anyone can develop and spread monkey pox.

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,160
Overall, monkey pox risk is moderate for people with multiple sexual partners and low for

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
the broader population.

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,020
According to a rapid risk assessment report published Monday by the European Center for

59
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,700
Disease Prevention and Control.

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,900
However, monkey pox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease.

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,060
I mean, fair enough, right?

62
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,220
There are those other methods of transmission.

63
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,620
HIV is technically not a sexually transmitted disease since you can get it without having

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,680
sex even though sex is one of the most common ways that it's spread.

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,980
So now we have to ask the question, what's the transmission rate looking like right now?

66
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,860
Well, a study from the New England Journal of Medicine followed 528 monkey pox cases

67
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,760
from 16 different countries and concluded that sex between men is driving the outbreak.

68
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,560
98% of people infected were gay or bi men, 75% of them were white, 41% of them had HIV,

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
95% of cases are thought to be transmitted during sex.

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,280
There's also no women infected yet either.

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,040
So uh, those are some pretty damning statistics regarding monkey pox actually being an STD.

72
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,520
I mean, yeah, it could be transmitted nonsexually, sure, but it's not.

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
At least not right now.

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,800
And if anecdotes are more your thing than raw data, that's fine too because a number

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,840
of gay men have decided to make the brave decision to step up and tell their story.

76
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,380
Like this guy, a babe the pig boy.

77
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,660
Hi, so I have monkey pox.

78
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not fishing for any sort of sympathy, but since I'm already known for being pretty

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,340
unabashed on the internet, I figured I'd give an honest account of how I got it and

80
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,460
how my symptoms manifested to hopefully educate anyone curious.

81
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
So strap in.

82
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,540
Jesus Christ, dude, based on your avatar, you're already strapped in.

83
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,380
So I finally got back into the swing of things and attended a friend's birthday orgy.

84
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,800
A friend's birthday orgy on Saturday the 9th.

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,080
Is that normal?

86
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Birthday orgies?

87
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,200
I had been watching the news on monkey pox, but the general feelings on it really were

88
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,860
and still are developing by the day.

89
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,320
So I, nor anyone else, were especially worried.

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,920
So I attended the orgy, had a great time, guzzled a metric fuckton of human piss.

91
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,480
I think I had sexual contact with around 15 men, similar to the other orgy on Saturday.

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,980
Had a great time, met some great people, then stumbled my piss-drunk ass home.

93
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,980
My two cents.

94
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,460
It's reductive to tell gay people not to have sex.

95
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,660
It didn't work in the early days of AIDS and clearly it's not working now.

96
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,040
But do your best to make educated choices.

97
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,900
Check your county's case numbers frequently, and if you can, avoid groups and anonymous

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
encounters.

99
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,520
I, um, I don't know about you, but drinking piss and fucking 15 men while saying that

100
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,600
nobody else can criticize your lifestyle.

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,020
I don't know if this tracks, man.

102
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,580
Or there's this guy whose tale was told in the Guardian.

103
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,660
I literally screamed out loud in pain, my two weeks of monkey pox hell.

104
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,620
When New York pride festivities kicked off on the 24th of June, I was aware that monkey

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,060
pox was an emerging issue, especially for gay men, but I was also under the impression

106
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,980
that the number of cases in the city was relatively small.

107
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,060
I had sex with several guys over the weekend.

108
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,720
Then a week later, on the first of July, I started feeling very fatigued.

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,820
I had a high fever with chills and muscle aches, and my lymph nodes were so swollen

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,340
they were protruding two inches out of my throat.

111
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,220
Next I took a COVID test, negative.

112
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,060
Then I started suspecting monkey pox.

113
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,460
Two days after my symptoms began, the rash started as anal rectal lesions, painful sores

114
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,020
on my anus and rectum.

115
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,620
Initially it was a stinging, itchy feeling.

116
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,920
I wasn't scared at this point.

117
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,340
I was told that it would be mild, and I was a completely healthy individual with no underlying

118
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
conditions.

119
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,300
But I had no idea how bad it was going to get.

120
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,300
After I went home, the rash started spreading, and I began to feel anxious.

121
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,340
I developed lesions literally everywhere.

122
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,180
They started looking like mosquito bites before developing into pimply blisters that would

123
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,620
eventually pop, then finally scab and leave a scar.

124
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,340
I had them on my skull, on my face, my arms, my legs, my feet, my hands, my torso, my back,

125
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,680
and five on my right elbow.

126
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,780
At the peak, I had 50 lesions, a fever of 103, and intense pain, prompting a panic attack.

127
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,400
Ironically, the only place I didn't have lesions was my penis.

128
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,660
The next day I got my results, positive for gonorrhea, but no word yet on monkey pox.

129
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,460
That's when I developed hives everywhere on my body from my neck down, as well as a headache,

130
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,500
arthritis pain in my fingers and shoulders, and a strange pain in my shin bone that got

131
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,180
so painful I couldn't stand up.

132
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,460
At night, I would wake up going crazy with both pain and itching from the lesions and

133
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,940
hives, just sitting up in bed and scratching myself.

134
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,000
I was isolated, lonely, and frustrated with how unfair the situation was.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
My anal lesions, which were already very painful, turned into open wounds.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,020
It felt like I had three fissures right next to each other, and it was absolutely excruciating.

137
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,620
I would literally scream out loud when I went to the bathroom.

138
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,020
Even keeping the area clean, like washing myself, was extremely painful.

139
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,960
So what kind of activities were you getting up to during New York Pride that you came

140
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,240
out of it with both monkey pox and gonorrhea?

141
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,300
Or there's this fellow, Matt Ford, who's a creative, who acts, writes, and sings, as well

142
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,980
as working for himself as a freelance producer and editor.

143
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,300
He's a proud, openly gay man who splits his time between LA and New York.

144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,400
Here's what my experience has been like so far, and why you should take it seriously.

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,740
Monkey pox seemed like a far-off problem in a vague world of potential inconveniences

146
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,760
eclipsed by bigger social concerns.

147
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,220
On Friday, June 17th, that quickly changed.

148
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,700
I received a call from a friend in LA who informed me that he had tested positive for

149
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,360
monkey pox and that I might have been exposed the weekend prior via skin-to-skin contact.

150
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,520
Sure enough, I checked myself for spots and noticed a couple of lesions in the underwear

151
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
zone.

152
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,880
You were having skin-to-skin contact with this guy?

153
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,840
You could just say that you fucked him, it's okay.

154
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,480
On Monday, June 20th, I went to the doctor, and they took a culture swab that was sent

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,400
to the LA County Department of Public Health.

156
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,600
They told me the following Thursday what I already knew.

157
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
It was positive.

158
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,240
Meanwhile, my symptoms intensified.

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,560
The lesions were becoming more intense and quite painful, to the point that I couldn't

160
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
sleep some nights.

161
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,120
They were filled with pus and became itchy.

162
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,120
To date, I have counted more than 25 and they're all over, on my arms, legs, hands, feet.

163
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,160
The flu-like symptoms abated slowly.

164
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
By Friday, a week after I'd first detected lesions, I felt mostly normal, at least besides

165
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
the lesions, which continued to appear.

166
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
Thankfully, I'm feeling much better.

167
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,840
While men who have sex with men currently make up the majority of cases, anyone can

168
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,440
get monkey pox, it is not a gay disease, and that is a fact that bears repeating to

169
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,480
tamp down the potential for stigma.

170
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,520
This is technically correct, yes, but a lot of these horrifying stories do, in fact, seem

171
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,760
to boil down to the choices of the men who get infected.

172
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,240
You know, guys, you don't actually have to go out to the pride parade and drink the piss

173
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
of 15 dudes, right?

174
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,060
Nobody's holding a gun to your head and asking you to do this.

175
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,920
You could just be normal, and by be normal, I don't mean be straight, because it's not

176
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,900
actually the LGBT community that's being affected by this.

177
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,360
No L's have this problem, no women at all, in fact.

178
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,040
No monogamous gay or bi people are having any issues either.

179
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,760
Trans people seem to be largely unaffected as well.

180
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,240
As far as I can tell, only one trans man has had monkey pox.

181
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
This isn't even a broader gay thing.

182
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,580
This is a specific type of highly promiscuous gay man who is disproportionately affected

183
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,840
by the monkey pox outbreak.

184
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,340
But nobody wants to hear that.

185
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,800
Nobody wants to hear that consequences are the result of your own bad choices, or that

186
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,900
this isn't somehow an attack on gays as a class.

187
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,620
That sentiment, by the way, is where we get headlines like, the Tory government is failing

188
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,020
queer men as monkey pox cases surge.

189
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,780
What exactly does Pink News want conservatives to do to fix this failing?

190
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,220
Force the gays back in the closet?

191
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,960
I mean, you don't accept, hey, maybe don't have giant barrels of gay semen poured into

192
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,340
your funneled out asshole as a solution here, so what else are conservatives meant to do?

193
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,380
Also it's not just conservatives.

194
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,820
California's LGBTQ community is feeling ignored, angry, confused as monkey pox cases rise.

195
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,140
The most left leaning government in the United States is apparently at fault too.

196
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,940
So the issue is just government, I guess.

197
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,460
It's the government's fault that you took a load of monkey pox pus into your asshole.

198
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,620
No, no, no, no.

199
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,140
The issue here is that these people are so dependent on the structures of the state to

200
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,520
do everything for them that when big daddy government can't save them with some new program

201
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,220
or initiative or whatever, they feel left out to dry.

202
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,540
They have no conception of being responsible for the quality of their own lives.

203
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,700
It's like that LinkedIn chick I talked about earlier.

204
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,080
These people are like pets of the state that are groomed and cared for and aren't used

205
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,100
to the idea that they may need to be proactive at some point or act in some sort of preventative

206
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
manner.

207
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,920
They reject the idea that adopting good habits can solve this problem.

208
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,980
They only accept treatment of the symptoms of their vices after the fact.

209
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,300
Y'all, please look at the requirements of the monkey pox vaccine.

210
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,780
People who meet all of the following criteria are eligible to be vaccinated.

211
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,580
You're a gay, a bisexual or other man who has sex with men and or are transgender, gender

212
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,460
nonconforming or gender nonbinary.

213
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,560
You're age 18 or older and you've had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the last 14 days.

214
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,680
If you do not meet these criteria, please do not make an appointment as you are not

215
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,560
eligible to be vaccinated at this time.

216
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,700
This person, by the way, is a progressive who is complaining that the vaccine specifically

217
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,080
singles out gay men and that it's homophobic of the government to do so.

218
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,940
This is like the inverse of religious fundamentalists back in the 1980s pretending that AIDS isn't

219
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,680
a problem because they're homophobic.

220
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,100
These guys want to pretend that monkey pox isn't a problem because they're woke.

221
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,300
Prioritizing the most at risk group of people for vaccines is how this kind of thing should

222
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
be done.

223
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,420
Most complaints that it spreads negative stereotypes about the gay community are fucking retarded.

224
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,260
This is when you're so woke that you would rather gay degenerates die of their degeneracy

225
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,340
before treating them.

226
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Jesus Christ.

227
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,900
And of course, to top it off, there's that one article from the most recent weekly sip.

228
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,700
US records first two child monkey pox cases, California toddler and an infant in D.C. were

229
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,380
both likely infected by household contacts and both had contact with gay or bisexual

230
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,380
men.

231
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,060
Now, listen, I know what you're all thinking.

232
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,100
I remember the statistics from earlier, too.

233
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,120
98% of people infected were gay or bi men, 95% of people caught it through sex.

234
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,520
It's entirely possible these kids caught it through one of those non-sexual methods.

235
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,180
But maybe we should just look into this a little bit, you know, just in case, like,

236
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,540
you know, hypothetically speaking here, if you find semen inside of a child's asshole,

237
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,860
perhaps the first order of business is to forget about how homophobic it sounds to ask

238
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
how it fucking got there.

239
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,420
Maybe we should be worried a bit less about the stigma, CDC.

240
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,300
Maybe that shouldn't be the priority here.

241
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,780
Like I said before, this isn't a gay problem.

242
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,000
This is a degenerate problem.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,460
A gay couple living in a closed, monogamous gay marriage, living a normal life.

244
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,620
They have nothing to fear from the monkey pox outbreak and neither do the overwhelming

245
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,180
majority of the rest of us.

246
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,480
If anything, this situation has made me more pro gay marriage than before.

247
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,380
Maybe gay marriage should be mandatory.

248
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,220
No gay sex unless you're married, if this is what you're going to do with it.

249
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,460
But yeah, this is not a pandemic situation.

250
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,780
COVID was like a medium on the bad scale, and this is nowhere near that.

251
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,220
If anyone tries to tell you that you can't go to work, you need to stay indoors because

252
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,420
of monkey pox, just reassure them that, hey, I'm not a degenerate.

253
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,780
It'll be okay.

254
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,740
How to not get monkey pox.

255
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:09,140
Step one, don't be a hoe.

256
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,260
Thank you for watching.
