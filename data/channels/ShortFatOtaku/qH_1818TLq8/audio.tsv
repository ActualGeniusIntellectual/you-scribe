0	11440	So, during my absence, Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama voted against forming the company's
11440	14840	first union, and progressives aren't too happy about it really.
14840	19600	And fair enough, Amazon's got a pretty well-established history of treating its workers poorly, from
19600	25740	shockingly high number of on-the-job injuries, to a patent for a cage worker pod that started
25740	31100	the Wage Cage meme, to employees dying on the job and nobody noticing for 20 minutes,
31100	35900	to an Amazon hiring AI having to be shut down because it was discriminating against women,
35900	40860	to an Amazon firing AI tracking warehouse workers and letting people go without a human
40860	45660	supervisor's involvement, to Amazon delivery men pissing in bottles in order to meet drop-off
45660	46660	quotas.
46660	49220	In case you think I'm here to be an Amazon simp, I'm not.
49220	53380	That being said, Amazon's certainly done some good things too, like implement a $15
53380	58380	minimum wage, provide medical, dental, and vision plans, a 401k, and stock options.
58380	62340	This is stuff that unions are often fighting for, and yet here they are without a union.
62340	66140	But in terms of the union vote itself, the way that the socialists reacted to the union's
66140	72060	loss was very similar to the way that progressives react when minorities don't vote left in
72060	73060	elections.
73060	76860	Yeah, this entire thread has a dem-blacks-don't-know-how-to-vote-right feel, doesn't it?
76860	80260	The actual truth is, though, most people are smart enough to know that unions aren't
80260	81260	a silver bullet.
81260	84620	I did a dumping with Scrump on that very topic, if you want to check it out.
84620	89740	But as an overview, unions provide both real benefits and real drawbacks, and these considerations
89740	92500	hold different weights depending on the industry we're talking about.
92500	94960	The positives for workers are pretty straightforward.
94960	96460	Unions protect workers' right to work.
96460	100620	In locations where you have at-will employment, meaning the employer can fire you for any
100620	104480	reason they want, even if you've done nothing wrong, unions can guard against undeserved
104480	105660	firings.
105660	108020	Unions increase workers' negotiation power.
108020	112220	When workers negotiate with the employer as a block, rather than individuals, there's
112220	113500	more weight behind it.
113500	117540	Having one employee walk off the job is not as damaging as having them all go.
117540	118940	Unions fight for benefits.
118940	123380	Even though Amazon provides a lot of benefits, many workplaces don't, and oftentimes benefits
123380	127220	have been pre-secured in a union workplace before you even take the job there.
127220	128700	Union workers may be paid better.
128700	133140	There is some evidence that unionized jobs pay better than their non-unionized counterparts,
133140	134340	all other things considered.
134340	138220	But there's also some evidence that the inverse is true too, so maybe this point's
138220	139220	undecided.
139220	141500	And that leads in very well to the negatives for workers.
141500	142500	Unions aren't free.
142500	145900	Union dues can eat up a significant chunk of change, and this is ultimately wasted money
145900	149460	if you never actually use any of your union benefits while you're at the job.
149460	153140	Additionally, unions, like any other bureaucracy, swell and become inefficient.
153140	157660	And you can expect these fees to rise in a disproportionate manner to their benefits.
157660	160700	Unions reinforce an adversarial relationship with management.
160700	163660	In workplaces where management is already adversarial with the workforce, this isn't
163660	164780	a big deal.
164780	168820	But, and I know socialists refuse to believe this, but it's true, I've experienced it,
168820	173580	there do exist positive workplaces where management cares about the quality of life of the workers,
173580	176920	and unions are a great way to destroy a positive workplace atmosphere.
176920	181040	In a functioning, healthy workplace, labour and management are on the same team, and unions
181040	183100	ensure this will never be the case.
183100	187660	It's settling for mediocre when the possibility is greatness out of fear of disaster.
187660	189180	Unions are anti-individualist.
189180	191940	This is a larger point I'll come back to a little bit later in the video.
191940	195780	Unions can cause increased prices, or decreased quality of product.
195780	199420	All of the extra things unions can win for workers still cost the business money, and
199420	203220	this cost is almost always carried on to the consumer, in much the same way that minimum
203220	204520	wage increases are.
204520	208820	And if the business is already failing, attempts to unionize are often toothless, as we've
208820	210960	seen with Gawker and Buzzfeed.
210960	214500	Unionization has never saved jobs in a failing business or a shrinking market.
214500	217060	Unions can be uniquely, incredibly corrupt.
217060	220700	Unions are hierarchies of individuals, and like every area of interpersonal activity,
220700	222120	there is the opportunity for corruption.
222120	223980	But unions are in a unique place legally.
223980	226300	They aren't the business, but they also aren't labour itself.
226300	228780	They're the apparatus that speaks for labour's interest.
228780	233080	They're often immune to antitrust laws for this reason, despite operating a labour monopoly
233080	234700	in the sub-markets they exist in.
234700	237200	This allows for quite a few opportunities for corruption.
237200	241140	For example, more than a dozen union officials, including two presidents, have been convicted
241140	243580	of embezzling funds from the United Auto Workers Union.
243580	248060	A president of the Communication Workers of America was caught stealing $600,000 in union
248060	249060	funds.
249060	252020	A president of the United Industrial Service Workers of America was sentenced for stealing
252020	254380	$800,000 from a union healthcare plan.
254380	258500	The Service Employees International Union has faced multiple lawsuits alleging sexual
258500	259500	harassment.
259500	263420	Unions have a long history making backroom deals with both organized crime and foreign
263420	264460	spy networks.
264460	268300	Of course, this doesn't mean that every single union is full of rapists or fedora-wearing
268300	270500	mobsters or KGB agents.
270500	274340	Unions can often provide protection for low-skilled workers and low-paying jobs.
274340	276980	And those people are often the ones who need the most protection.
276980	280140	Unions raise the floor, but they also lower the ceiling, too.
280140	281140	Consider this.
281140	285500	Most union contracts in low-skilled workplaces have things like raises or promotions on a
285500	286500	set calendar.
286500	289420	For example, if you're going to get a raise, you'll get it once you reach a milestone
289420	291580	of however many months or years served.
291580	295840	This generally, but not always, closes the door to the possibility of raises based on
295840	298020	merit or independent negotiation.
298020	299700	The same thing happens with promotions.
299700	303180	When an opportunity appears to move up the food chain, it'll be handed out based on
303180	304820	seniority, not merit.
304820	308540	And unlike with raises where there's sometimes a bit of wiggle room, most union contracts
308540	310300	on promotions are ironclad.
310300	314820	In this situation, if you were a poor, inefficient, or lazy worker, you would find that the union
314820	318620	in this low-skilled work environment would certainly protect you from getting fired.
318620	322400	And you would be handed your contract-allotted wage advancements like clockwork whether you
322400	323400	deserve them or not.
323400	328100	But if you were a talented, quick, or enthusiastic worker, somebody who had the raw potential
328100	332260	to rise the ranks on your own merit, the union structure itself would hold you back.
332260	335780	It doesn't matter if you can push 10 times more product than meth-head Michael, he's
335780	339160	been there 10 years and you've been here too, so he gets the promotion.
339160	343580	In this environment, unions serve primarily to protect mediocrity, and such a workplace
343580	347860	will see a regular turnover of their most promising workers as they move on to greener
347860	348860	pastures.
348860	351920	And this is where we get to that anti-individualist point I mentioned earlier.
351920	355800	If you are somebody who's talented, skilled, or driven enough to be able to negotiate with
355800	359920	your employer on your own merits, a union will only serve to hurt you, not help you.
359920	362820	You won't have the option to stand apart or represent yourself.
362820	366180	Your employer's hands will be bound by the contract, stating that they can only treat
366180	367880	with you through the union apparatus.
367880	371280	And the union's hands will be bound by the contract, putting more senior members of the
371280	372320	union ahead of you.
372320	377840	It is inherently anti-meritocratic, and in most cases, you have no choice but to be part
377840	380200	of the union if you want the job, even if you don't want to be.
380200	385160	Of course, socialists often make the false claim that employers will never, ever directly
385160	389920	negotiate with individual employees, because employers always hold the cards in hiring.
389920	391640	They believe this for two different reasons.
391640	395640	One, because they're generally working in low-skilled jobs themselves, and have never
395640	398300	seen a high-skilled worker negotiate for themselves.
398300	402000	And two, because decades of mass immigration have flooded the labor market, depressing
402000	405680	the price of labor for so long, people have largely forgotten what it's like when there's
405680	409600	more jobs than workers, and employers have to fight over employees.
409600	414040	After all, there's a reason that employers tend to poach employees from each other, and
414040	418080	have non-disclosure and non-compete agreements in their employment contracts the higher up
418080	419080	you go.
419080	422680	It's because if you make yourself a valuable worker, whether that's through education,
422680	427280	rare qualifications, industry connections, a good reputation, work ethic or intelligence,
427280	430720	then eventually you will reach a tipping point where there is greater demand for your specialized
430720	432800	skills and employers will compete to hire you.
432800	434600	A great example of this is in the UK.
434600	438480	If a building has historic importance, you need specialized qualifications to work on
438480	441320	it, due to the nature of the materials and the architecture involved.
441320	445440	Only seven people in the entire country have the license, and you can bet those seven control
445440	447980	the market for their labor, not their employers.
447980	451920	The point I'm making is, while a properly functioning union can help the lowest rung
451920	455280	of workers, it will eventually hurt you the higher you climb.
455280	457220	It raises the floor, but lowers the ceiling.
457220	460240	This is why you're less and less likely to find a union presence the higher you climb
460240	464520	in any organization, and why, eventually, the next promotion that you can take will
464520	467200	require you leaving the union and going staff.
467200	471280	But even for people at the bottom of the hierarchy, research shows unionized workers are less
471280	472280	happy.
472280	474800	Yeah, you know, I was surprised to read this too, but it actually kind of makes sense if
474800	475800	you think about it.
475800	479900	Many of the early studies suggest that union members are less satisfied than non-union
479900	483120	workers, but are also less inclined to quit their jobs.
483120	487340	This surprising finding has been considered an anomaly by many researchers, as unions
487340	491420	should achieve better working conditions, which, common sense suggests, should lead
491420	493040	to higher job satisfaction.
493040	495320	The author's research helps answer the puzzle.
495320	499240	In a recent meta-study, he found that unions don't seem to make workers less satisfied.
499240	503560	Rather, workers who are likely to be dissatisfied, even after controlling for various aspects
503560	505680	of their work, are more likely to join unions.
505680	507120	And this makes sense, right?
507120	510400	If you're satisfied with your job already, if you feel your wage is fair and you're
510400	513500	being heard and taken care of, you're not going to need a union.
513500	516800	Unions are things people advocate for if they feel like they're downtrodden, or they
516800	518840	agitate for if they've been radicalized.
518840	522840	However, the same research in this article shows that union workers who are more likely
522840	526180	to be dissatisfied are also less likely to quit their jobs.
526180	529000	This is surprising on its face, but it makes sense.
529000	531640	Let's say you're in a non-union workplace, and your job is shitty.
531640	535200	You approach your boss about suggestions to make it better, and your boss, being an asshole,
535200	537880	tells you to shut up and get back to work because your voice doesn't matter.
537880	541960	Now, controlling for variables like pay and benefits and the job market around you, there's
541960	545400	a reasonable chance that you'd walk off the job right then and there, especially if
545400	546400	you have a spine.
546400	549220	But now let's say you're in a union workplace, and your job is shit.
549220	552520	You approach your boss about suggestions to make it better, and your boss is still an
552520	556400	asshole, but this time he says, well, the union provides for a worker suggestion box,
556400	557680	so put your suggestion in there.
557680	561200	You talk to your union rep, you file away your suggestion, which will never be read,
561200	565000	and will be discarded immediately if it is, and then you go on working for another day.
565000	568680	It's true that in a bad workplace, a union can serve to protect you from unjust firings,
568680	571720	but it also serves to convince you not to quit when you've been slighted, because
571720	575440	it grants you the illusion that you're being heard, that you're understood, that
575440	578600	you're participating in something, when the truth is, the union rep and management
578600	580720	are probably hanging out after hours laughing at you.
580720	583120	I want it to be clear, I'm not strictly anti-union.
583120	585120	They have their place, and they can do good.
585120	589080	In fact, if you're a free marketeer, you should be pro-union, because collective bargaining
589080	591720	is a market force, just like individual bargaining is.
591720	596460	Free market only means that the state should not threaten individual free agents from acting
596460	598420	freely at the barrel of a gun.
598420	601620	It doesn't say that people can't come together to foreign unions, or companies.
601620	605240	But this position that socialists have taken up, that unions are always good no matter
605240	609200	what, and management will always be pure evil, is laughably stupid, and I love it when it
609200	610540	blows up in their face.
610540	614720	Like when Medium says that their workers attempt to unionize was just an amplification of cis
614720	619540	white male voices, or when Kickstarter said their workers attempt to unionize was a misappropriation
619540	621800	of unions for use by privileged workers.
621800	625980	Yeah, you made this corporations go woke bed, and you can fucking lie in it.
625980	629560	And of course it goes without saying that these people suddenly become violently anti-union
629560	632400	when it's a police union, but that's a topic for another day.
632400	636400	For better or worse, unions are falling out of style, and when it comes to that anti-individualist
636400	638600	stance I mentioned earlier, I can see why.
638600	639960	Consider this story.
639960	642480	Instacart is firing every employee who voted to unionize.
642480	644200	Sounds pretty bad, right?
644200	647400	Instacart operates under a gig model like Uber and Lyft, who have both dealt with their
647400	648920	own unionization woes.
648920	652580	But consider that gig business model as compared to a traditional job.
652580	656800	At a regular unionized workplace, like say at a grocery store, or a food packing plant,
656800	660480	or some other blue collar job, you've got a union that protects you, but you still show
660480	663240	up for the hours they schedule you, whether you like it or not.
663240	666520	The whole purpose of an independent contractor job is that you can make your own hours.
666520	668360	You don't want to work for Uber today?
668360	669360	Well then don't.
669360	670820	Set yourself unavailable on the app.
670820	672280	Have plans at 7pm?
672280	674840	Okay, work whenever you want and then call it a day when you're done.
674840	678680	I know at-will employment is considered a dirty word in the States, but that doesn't
678680	682140	just mean at-will for the employer, it also means at-will for the worker.
682140	686200	These types of jobs have their drawbacks, but what they provide that a 9-5 unionized
686200	688860	workplace does not is infinite flexibility.
688860	693040	Some people consider content creators not to be self-employed, but to be employees of
693040	694040	YouTube or Twitch.
694040	696280	I don't agree with that, but let's run with it.
696280	700360	If we are employees, that means we're operating on a gig model, and I couldn't be happier
700360	701360	with it.
701440	704400	If I post a video tomorrow, I don't post a video, and the responsibility of what happens
704400	705400	is on me.
705400	706400	I don't get paid.
706400	710040	I might lose out in the algorithm, whatever it is, but it's my choice, and I can come
710040	713960	back the next day and post a video again without the possibility of getting fired by YouTube
713960	717560	for a no-call no-show and having my channel given away to somebody else.
717560	721960	The gig model is not for everybody, but for people with specific personalities or lifestyles
721960	726000	it's perfect, and this drive to unionize everything is ruining the benefits for those
726000	728400	attracted to this idea of working at their leisure.
728440	732600	I think this stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of unions,
732600	734440	where they are appropriate and where they are not.
734440	735440	Case in point.
735440	739660	No dude, simply not showing up to work is not striking, and it was good to fire you
739660	741280	when you stopped doing your job.
741280	742280	You're an idiot.
742280	747360	Worst part is, all this union idiocy is probably going to end up hurting the good unions too.
747360	750680	Walmart already aggressively union busts, and they're one of the shittiest employers
750680	751680	around.
751680	753940	I actually think Walmart's one of the places where you really should have a union and yet
753940	754940	here we are.
755020	758780	At the same time, Amazon has been employing some truly dystopian things, like tracking
758780	763320	employees with heat sensors to try and determine pro-union sentiment, or taking advantage of
763320	766900	workplace ethnic strife to prevent unionization attempts.
766900	770820	Unions may be good in these situations, because Walmart and Amazon are both kind of shitty,
770820	774260	but socialists have royally shit the bed on the union question to the point that your
774260	776260	average person is never going to touch it.
776260	779020	So yeah, that union vote failed.
779020	780020	And you know what?
780020	781020	It failed fair and square.
781020	784080	No no no no no, don't call to stop counting the ballots.
784080	787520	Don't complain that illegal ballot drop boxes invalidated the vote.
787520	792160	Don't complain that large batches of ballots arrived at odd times, and it seemed suspicious
792160	793360	that they would do so.
793360	798120	Don't complain that Jeff Bezos himself was against the idea of mail-in voting as it would
798120	799640	be considered unfair.
799640	800760	Stop crying about it.
800760	802840	This is normal election behavior.
802840	806760	Amazon is just fortifying the vote, and leftists are just conspiracy theorists who are butt
806760	809480	mad that they lost.
