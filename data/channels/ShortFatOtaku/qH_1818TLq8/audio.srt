1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
So, during my absence, Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama voted against forming the company's

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,840
first union, and progressives aren't too happy about it really.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,600
And fair enough, Amazon's got a pretty well-established history of treating its workers poorly, from

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,740
shockingly high number of on-the-job injuries, to a patent for a cage worker pod that started

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,100
the Wage Cage meme, to employees dying on the job and nobody noticing for 20 minutes,

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,900
to an Amazon hiring AI having to be shut down because it was discriminating against women,

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,860
to an Amazon firing AI tracking warehouse workers and letting people go without a human

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,660
supervisor's involvement, to Amazon delivery men pissing in bottles in order to meet drop-off

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,660
quotas.

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,220
In case you think I'm here to be an Amazon simp, I'm not.

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,380
That being said, Amazon's certainly done some good things too, like implement a $15

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,380
minimum wage, provide medical, dental, and vision plans, a 401k, and stock options.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,340
This is stuff that unions are often fighting for, and yet here they are without a union.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,140
But in terms of the union vote itself, the way that the socialists reacted to the union's

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,060
loss was very similar to the way that progressives react when minorities don't vote left in

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,060
elections.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,860
Yeah, this entire thread has a dem-blacks-don't-know-how-to-vote-right feel, doesn't it?

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,260
The actual truth is, though, most people are smart enough to know that unions aren't

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,260
a silver bullet.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,620
I did a dumping with Scrump on that very topic, if you want to check it out.

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,740
But as an overview, unions provide both real benefits and real drawbacks, and these considerations

22
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,500
hold different weights depending on the industry we're talking about.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,960
The positives for workers are pretty straightforward.

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,460
Unions protect workers' right to work.

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,620
In locations where you have at-will employment, meaning the employer can fire you for any

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,480
reason they want, even if you've done nothing wrong, unions can guard against undeserved

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,660
firings.

28
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,020
Unions increase workers' negotiation power.

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,220
When workers negotiate with the employer as a block, rather than individuals, there's

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,500
more weight behind it.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,540
Having one employee walk off the job is not as damaging as having them all go.

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,940
Unions fight for benefits.

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,380
Even though Amazon provides a lot of benefits, many workplaces don't, and oftentimes benefits

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,220
have been pre-secured in a union workplace before you even take the job there.

35
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,700
Union workers may be paid better.

36
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,140
There is some evidence that unionized jobs pay better than their non-unionized counterparts,

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,340
all other things considered.

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,220
But there's also some evidence that the inverse is true too, so maybe this point's

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
undecided.

40
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,500
And that leads in very well to the negatives for workers.

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Unions aren't free.

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,900
Union dues can eat up a significant chunk of change, and this is ultimately wasted money

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,460
if you never actually use any of your union benefits while you're at the job.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,140
Additionally, unions, like any other bureaucracy, swell and become inefficient.

45
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,660
And you can expect these fees to rise in a disproportionate manner to their benefits.

46
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,700
Unions reinforce an adversarial relationship with management.

47
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,660
In workplaces where management is already adversarial with the workforce, this isn't

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,780
a big deal.

49
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,820
But, and I know socialists refuse to believe this, but it's true, I've experienced it,

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,580
there do exist positive workplaces where management cares about the quality of life of the workers,

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,920
and unions are a great way to destroy a positive workplace atmosphere.

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,040
In a functioning, healthy workplace, labour and management are on the same team, and unions

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,100
ensure this will never be the case.

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,660
It's settling for mediocre when the possibility is greatness out of fear of disaster.

55
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,180
Unions are anti-individualist.

56
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,940
This is a larger point I'll come back to a little bit later in the video.

57
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,780
Unions can cause increased prices, or decreased quality of product.

58
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,420
All of the extra things unions can win for workers still cost the business money, and

59
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,220
this cost is almost always carried on to the consumer, in much the same way that minimum

60
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,520
wage increases are.

61
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,820
And if the business is already failing, attempts to unionize are often toothless, as we've

62
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,960
seen with Gawker and Buzzfeed.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,500
Unionization has never saved jobs in a failing business or a shrinking market.

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,060
Unions can be uniquely, incredibly corrupt.

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,700
Unions are hierarchies of individuals, and like every area of interpersonal activity,

66
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,120
there is the opportunity for corruption.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,980
But unions are in a unique place legally.

68
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,300
They aren't the business, but they also aren't labour itself.

69
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,780
They're the apparatus that speaks for labour's interest.

70
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,080
They're often immune to antitrust laws for this reason, despite operating a labour monopoly

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,700
in the sub-markets they exist in.

72
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,200
This allows for quite a few opportunities for corruption.

73
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,140
For example, more than a dozen union officials, including two presidents, have been convicted

74
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,580
of embezzling funds from the United Auto Workers Union.

75
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,060
A president of the Communication Workers of America was caught stealing $600,000 in union

76
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,060
funds.

77
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,020
A president of the United Industrial Service Workers of America was sentenced for stealing

78
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,380
$800,000 from a union healthcare plan.

79
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,500
The Service Employees International Union has faced multiple lawsuits alleging sexual

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
harassment.

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,420
Unions have a long history making backroom deals with both organized crime and foreign

82
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,460
spy networks.

83
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,300
Of course, this doesn't mean that every single union is full of rapists or fedora-wearing

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,500
mobsters or KGB agents.

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,340
Unions can often provide protection for low-skilled workers and low-paying jobs.

86
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,980
And those people are often the ones who need the most protection.

87
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,140
Unions raise the floor, but they also lower the ceiling, too.

88
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
Consider this.

89
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,500
Most union contracts in low-skilled workplaces have things like raises or promotions on a

90
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
set calendar.

91
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,420
For example, if you're going to get a raise, you'll get it once you reach a milestone

92
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,580
of however many months or years served.

93
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,840
This generally, but not always, closes the door to the possibility of raises based on

94
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,020
merit or independent negotiation.

95
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,700
The same thing happens with promotions.

96
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,180
When an opportunity appears to move up the food chain, it'll be handed out based on

97
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,820
seniority, not merit.

98
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,540
And unlike with raises where there's sometimes a bit of wiggle room, most union contracts

99
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,300
on promotions are ironclad.

100
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,820
In this situation, if you were a poor, inefficient, or lazy worker, you would find that the union

101
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,620
in this low-skilled work environment would certainly protect you from getting fired.

102
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,400
And you would be handed your contract-allotted wage advancements like clockwork whether you

103
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
deserve them or not.

104
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,100
But if you were a talented, quick, or enthusiastic worker, somebody who had the raw potential

105
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,260
to rise the ranks on your own merit, the union structure itself would hold you back.

106
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,780
It doesn't matter if you can push 10 times more product than meth-head Michael, he's

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,160
been there 10 years and you've been here too, so he gets the promotion.

108
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,580
In this environment, unions serve primarily to protect mediocrity, and such a workplace

109
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,860
will see a regular turnover of their most promising workers as they move on to greener

110
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
pastures.

111
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,920
And this is where we get to that anti-individualist point I mentioned earlier.

112
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,800
If you are somebody who's talented, skilled, or driven enough to be able to negotiate with

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,920
your employer on your own merits, a union will only serve to hurt you, not help you.

114
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,820
You won't have the option to stand apart or represent yourself.

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,180
Your employer's hands will be bound by the contract, stating that they can only treat

116
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,880
with you through the union apparatus.

117
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,280
And the union's hands will be bound by the contract, putting more senior members of the

118
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,320
union ahead of you.

119
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,840
It is inherently anti-meritocratic, and in most cases, you have no choice but to be part

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,200
of the union if you want the job, even if you don't want to be.

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,160
Of course, socialists often make the false claim that employers will never, ever directly

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,920
negotiate with individual employees, because employers always hold the cards in hiring.

123
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,640
They believe this for two different reasons.

124
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,640
One, because they're generally working in low-skilled jobs themselves, and have never

125
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,300
seen a high-skilled worker negotiate for themselves.

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,000
And two, because decades of mass immigration have flooded the labor market, depressing

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
the price of labor for so long, people have largely forgotten what it's like when there's

128
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,600
more jobs than workers, and employers have to fight over employees.

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,040
After all, there's a reason that employers tend to poach employees from each other, and

130
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,080
have non-disclosure and non-compete agreements in their employment contracts the higher up

131
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
you go.

132
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,680
It's because if you make yourself a valuable worker, whether that's through education,

133
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,280
rare qualifications, industry connections, a good reputation, work ethic or intelligence,

134
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
then eventually you will reach a tipping point where there is greater demand for your specialized

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
skills and employers will compete to hire you.

136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
A great example of this is in the UK.

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,480
If a building has historic importance, you need specialized qualifications to work on

138
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,320
it, due to the nature of the materials and the architecture involved.

139
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,440
Only seven people in the entire country have the license, and you can bet those seven control

140
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,980
the market for their labor, not their employers.

141
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,920
The point I'm making is, while a properly functioning union can help the lowest rung

142
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,280
of workers, it will eventually hurt you the higher you climb.

143
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,220
It raises the floor, but lowers the ceiling.

144
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,240
This is why you're less and less likely to find a union presence the higher you climb

145
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,520
in any organization, and why, eventually, the next promotion that you can take will

146
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,200
require you leaving the union and going staff.

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,280
But even for people at the bottom of the hierarchy, research shows unionized workers are less

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
happy.

149
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah, you know, I was surprised to read this too, but it actually kind of makes sense if

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
you think about it.

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,900
Many of the early studies suggest that union members are less satisfied than non-union

152
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,120
workers, but are also less inclined to quit their jobs.

153
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,340
This surprising finding has been considered an anomaly by many researchers, as unions

154
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,420
should achieve better working conditions, which, common sense suggests, should lead

155
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,040
to higher job satisfaction.

156
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,320
The author's research helps answer the puzzle.

157
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,240
In a recent meta-study, he found that unions don't seem to make workers less satisfied.

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,560
Rather, workers who are likely to be dissatisfied, even after controlling for various aspects

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,680
of their work, are more likely to join unions.

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
And this makes sense, right?

161
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
If you're satisfied with your job already, if you feel your wage is fair and you're

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,500
being heard and taken care of, you're not going to need a union.

163
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,800
Unions are things people advocate for if they feel like they're downtrodden, or they

164
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,840
agitate for if they've been radicalized.

165
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,840
However, the same research in this article shows that union workers who are more likely

166
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,180
to be dissatisfied are also less likely to quit their jobs.

167
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,000
This is surprising on its face, but it makes sense.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,640
Let's say you're in a non-union workplace, and your job is shitty.

169
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,200
You approach your boss about suggestions to make it better, and your boss, being an asshole,

170
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,880
tells you to shut up and get back to work because your voice doesn't matter.

171
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,960
Now, controlling for variables like pay and benefits and the job market around you, there's

172
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,400
a reasonable chance that you'd walk off the job right then and there, especially if

173
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
you have a spine.

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,220
But now let's say you're in a union workplace, and your job is shit.

175
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,520
You approach your boss about suggestions to make it better, and your boss is still an

176
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,400
asshole, but this time he says, well, the union provides for a worker suggestion box,

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,680
so put your suggestion in there.

178
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,200
You talk to your union rep, you file away your suggestion, which will never be read,

179
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,000
and will be discarded immediately if it is, and then you go on working for another day.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,680
It's true that in a bad workplace, a union can serve to protect you from unjust firings,

181
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,720
but it also serves to convince you not to quit when you've been slighted, because

182
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,440
it grants you the illusion that you're being heard, that you're understood, that

183
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,600
you're participating in something, when the truth is, the union rep and management

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,720
are probably hanging out after hours laughing at you.

185
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
I want it to be clear, I'm not strictly anti-union.

186
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
They have their place, and they can do good.

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,080
In fact, if you're a free marketeer, you should be pro-union, because collective bargaining

188
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,720
is a market force, just like individual bargaining is.

189
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,460
Free market only means that the state should not threaten individual free agents from acting

190
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,420
freely at the barrel of a gun.

191
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,620
It doesn't say that people can't come together to foreign unions, or companies.

192
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,240
But this position that socialists have taken up, that unions are always good no matter

193
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,200
what, and management will always be pure evil, is laughably stupid, and I love it when it

194
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,540
blows up in their face.

195
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,720
Like when Medium says that their workers attempt to unionize was just an amplification of cis

196
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,540
white male voices, or when Kickstarter said their workers attempt to unionize was a misappropriation

197
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,800
of unions for use by privileged workers.

198
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,980
Yeah, you made this corporations go woke bed, and you can fucking lie in it.

199
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,560
And of course it goes without saying that these people suddenly become violently anti-union

200
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,400
when it's a police union, but that's a topic for another day.

201
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,400
For better or worse, unions are falling out of style, and when it comes to that anti-individualist

202
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,600
stance I mentioned earlier, I can see why.

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
Consider this story.

204
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,480
Instacart is firing every employee who voted to unionize.

205
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,200
Sounds pretty bad, right?

206
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Instacart operates under a gig model like Uber and Lyft, who have both dealt with their

207
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,920
own unionization woes.

208
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,580
But consider that gig business model as compared to a traditional job.

209
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,800
At a regular unionized workplace, like say at a grocery store, or a food packing plant,

210
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
or some other blue collar job, you've got a union that protects you, but you still show

211
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,240
up for the hours they schedule you, whether you like it or not.

212
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,520
The whole purpose of an independent contractor job is that you can make your own hours.

213
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,360
You don't want to work for Uber today?

214
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Well then don't.

215
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,820
Set yourself unavailable on the app.

216
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,280
Have plans at 7pm?

217
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,840
Okay, work whenever you want and then call it a day when you're done.

218
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,680
I know at-will employment is considered a dirty word in the States, but that doesn't

219
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,140
just mean at-will for the employer, it also means at-will for the worker.

220
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,200
These types of jobs have their drawbacks, but what they provide that a 9-5 unionized

221
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,860
workplace does not is infinite flexibility.

222
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,040
Some people consider content creators not to be self-employed, but to be employees of

223
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
YouTube or Twitch.

224
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,280
I don't agree with that, but let's run with it.

225
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,360
If we are employees, that means we're operating on a gig model, and I couldn't be happier

226
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
with it.

227
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,400
If I post a video tomorrow, I don't post a video, and the responsibility of what happens

228
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
is on me.

229
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
I don't get paid.

230
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,040
I might lose out in the algorithm, whatever it is, but it's my choice, and I can come

231
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,960
back the next day and post a video again without the possibility of getting fired by YouTube

232
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,560
for a no-call no-show and having my channel given away to somebody else.

233
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,960
The gig model is not for everybody, but for people with specific personalities or lifestyles

234
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,000
it's perfect, and this drive to unionize everything is ruining the benefits for those

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
attracted to this idea of working at their leisure.

236
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,600
I think this stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of unions,

237
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,440
where they are appropriate and where they are not.

238
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Case in point.

239
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,660
No dude, simply not showing up to work is not striking, and it was good to fire you

240
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,280
when you stopped doing your job.

241
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
You're an idiot.

242
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,360
Worst part is, all this union idiocy is probably going to end up hurting the good unions too.

243
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,680
Walmart already aggressively union busts, and they're one of the shittiest employers

244
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
around.

245
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,940
I actually think Walmart's one of the places where you really should have a union and yet

246
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
here we are.

247
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,780
At the same time, Amazon has been employing some truly dystopian things, like tracking

248
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,320
employees with heat sensors to try and determine pro-union sentiment, or taking advantage of

249
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,900
workplace ethnic strife to prevent unionization attempts.

250
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,820
Unions may be good in these situations, because Walmart and Amazon are both kind of shitty,

251
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,260
but socialists have royally shit the bed on the union question to the point that your

252
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,260
average person is never going to touch it.

253
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,020
So yeah, that union vote failed.

254
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
And you know what?

255
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,020
It failed fair and square.

256
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,080
No no no no no, don't call to stop counting the ballots.

257
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,520
Don't complain that illegal ballot drop boxes invalidated the vote.

258
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,160
Don't complain that large batches of ballots arrived at odd times, and it seemed suspicious

259
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
that they would do so.

260
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,120
Don't complain that Jeff Bezos himself was against the idea of mail-in voting as it would

261
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,640
be considered unfair.

262
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,760
Stop crying about it.

263
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,840
This is normal election behavior.

264
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,760
Amazon is just fortifying the vote, and leftists are just conspiracy theorists who are butt

265
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,480
mad that they lost.

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Sound familiar?

267
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,060
