00:00.000 --> 00:11.440
So, during my absence, Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama voted against forming the company's

00:11.440 --> 00:14.840
first union, and progressives aren't too happy about it really.

00:14.840 --> 00:19.600
And fair enough, Amazon's got a pretty well-established history of treating its workers poorly, from

00:19.600 --> 00:25.740
shockingly high number of on-the-job injuries, to a patent for a cage worker pod that started

00:25.740 --> 00:31.100
the Wage Cage meme, to employees dying on the job and nobody noticing for 20 minutes,

00:31.100 --> 00:35.900
to an Amazon hiring AI having to be shut down because it was discriminating against women,

00:35.900 --> 00:40.860
to an Amazon firing AI tracking warehouse workers and letting people go without a human

00:40.860 --> 00:45.660
supervisor's involvement, to Amazon delivery men pissing in bottles in order to meet drop-off

00:45.660 --> 00:46.660
quotas.

00:46.660 --> 00:49.220
In case you think I'm here to be an Amazon simp, I'm not.

00:49.220 --> 00:53.380
That being said, Amazon's certainly done some good things too, like implement a $15

00:53.380 --> 00:58.380
minimum wage, provide medical, dental, and vision plans, a 401k, and stock options.

00:58.380 --> 01:02.340
This is stuff that unions are often fighting for, and yet here they are without a union.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.140
But in terms of the union vote itself, the way that the socialists reacted to the union's

01:06.140 --> 01:12.060
loss was very similar to the way that progressives react when minorities don't vote left in

01:12.060 --> 01:13.060
elections.

01:13.060 --> 01:16.860
Yeah, this entire thread has a dem-blacks-don't-know-how-to-vote-right feel, doesn't it?

01:16.860 --> 01:20.260
The actual truth is, though, most people are smart enough to know that unions aren't

01:20.260 --> 01:21.260
a silver bullet.

01:21.260 --> 01:24.620
I did a dumping with Scrump on that very topic, if you want to check it out.

01:24.620 --> 01:29.740
But as an overview, unions provide both real benefits and real drawbacks, and these considerations

01:29.740 --> 01:32.500
hold different weights depending on the industry we're talking about.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.960
The positives for workers are pretty straightforward.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.460
Unions protect workers' right to work.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.620
In locations where you have at-will employment, meaning the employer can fire you for any

01:40.620 --> 01:44.480
reason they want, even if you've done nothing wrong, unions can guard against undeserved

01:44.480 --> 01:45.660
firings.

01:45.660 --> 01:48.020
Unions increase workers' negotiation power.

01:48.020 --> 01:52.220
When workers negotiate with the employer as a block, rather than individuals, there's

01:52.220 --> 01:53.500
more weight behind it.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.540
Having one employee walk off the job is not as damaging as having them all go.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.940
Unions fight for benefits.

01:58.940 --> 02:03.380
Even though Amazon provides a lot of benefits, many workplaces don't, and oftentimes benefits

02:03.380 --> 02:07.220
have been pre-secured in a union workplace before you even take the job there.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.700
Union workers may be paid better.

02:08.700 --> 02:13.140
There is some evidence that unionized jobs pay better than their non-unionized counterparts,

02:13.140 --> 02:14.340
all other things considered.

02:14.340 --> 02:18.220
But there's also some evidence that the inverse is true too, so maybe this point's

02:18.220 --> 02:19.220
undecided.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.500
And that leads in very well to the negatives for workers.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.500
Unions aren't free.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.900
Union dues can eat up a significant chunk of change, and this is ultimately wasted money

02:25.900 --> 02:29.460
if you never actually use any of your union benefits while you're at the job.

02:29.460 --> 02:33.140
Additionally, unions, like any other bureaucracy, swell and become inefficient.

02:33.140 --> 02:37.660
And you can expect these fees to rise in a disproportionate manner to their benefits.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.700
Unions reinforce an adversarial relationship with management.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.660
In workplaces where management is already adversarial with the workforce, this isn't

02:43.660 --> 02:44.780
a big deal.

02:44.780 --> 02:48.820
But, and I know socialists refuse to believe this, but it's true, I've experienced it,

02:48.820 --> 02:53.580
there do exist positive workplaces where management cares about the quality of life of the workers,

02:53.580 --> 02:56.920
and unions are a great way to destroy a positive workplace atmosphere.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.040
In a functioning, healthy workplace, labour and management are on the same team, and unions

03:01.040 --> 03:03.100
ensure this will never be the case.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.660
It's settling for mediocre when the possibility is greatness out of fear of disaster.

03:07.660 --> 03:09.180
Unions are anti-individualist.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.940
This is a larger point I'll come back to a little bit later in the video.

03:11.940 --> 03:15.780
Unions can cause increased prices, or decreased quality of product.

03:15.780 --> 03:19.420
All of the extra things unions can win for workers still cost the business money, and

03:19.420 --> 03:23.220
this cost is almost always carried on to the consumer, in much the same way that minimum

03:23.220 --> 03:24.520
wage increases are.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.820
And if the business is already failing, attempts to unionize are often toothless, as we've

03:28.820 --> 03:30.960
seen with Gawker and Buzzfeed.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.500
Unionization has never saved jobs in a failing business or a shrinking market.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.060
Unions can be uniquely, incredibly corrupt.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.700
Unions are hierarchies of individuals, and like every area of interpersonal activity,

03:40.700 --> 03:42.120
there is the opportunity for corruption.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.980
But unions are in a unique place legally.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.300
They aren't the business, but they also aren't labour itself.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.780
They're the apparatus that speaks for labour's interest.

03:48.780 --> 03:53.080
They're often immune to antitrust laws for this reason, despite operating a labour monopoly

03:53.080 --> 03:54.700
in the sub-markets they exist in.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.200
This allows for quite a few opportunities for corruption.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.140
For example, more than a dozen union officials, including two presidents, have been convicted

04:01.140 --> 04:03.580
of embezzling funds from the United Auto Workers Union.

04:03.580 --> 04:08.060
A president of the Communication Workers of America was caught stealing $600,000 in union

04:08.060 --> 04:09.060
funds.

04:09.060 --> 04:12.020
A president of the United Industrial Service Workers of America was sentenced for stealing

04:12.020 --> 04:14.380
$800,000 from a union healthcare plan.

04:14.380 --> 04:18.500
The Service Employees International Union has faced multiple lawsuits alleging sexual

04:18.500 --> 04:19.500
harassment.

04:19.500 --> 04:23.420
Unions have a long history making backroom deals with both organized crime and foreign

04:23.420 --> 04:24.460
spy networks.

04:24.460 --> 04:28.300
Of course, this doesn't mean that every single union is full of rapists or fedora-wearing

04:28.300 --> 04:30.500
mobsters or KGB agents.

04:30.500 --> 04:34.340
Unions can often provide protection for low-skilled workers and low-paying jobs.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.980
And those people are often the ones who need the most protection.

04:36.980 --> 04:40.140
Unions raise the floor, but they also lower the ceiling, too.

04:40.140 --> 04:41.140
Consider this.

04:41.140 --> 04:45.500
Most union contracts in low-skilled workplaces have things like raises or promotions on a

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
set calendar.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.420
For example, if you're going to get a raise, you'll get it once you reach a milestone

04:49.420 --> 04:51.580
of however many months or years served.

04:51.580 --> 04:55.840
This generally, but not always, closes the door to the possibility of raises based on

04:55.840 --> 04:58.020
merit or independent negotiation.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.700
The same thing happens with promotions.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.180
When an opportunity appears to move up the food chain, it'll be handed out based on

05:03.180 --> 05:04.820
seniority, not merit.

05:04.820 --> 05:08.540
And unlike with raises where there's sometimes a bit of wiggle room, most union contracts

05:08.540 --> 05:10.300
on promotions are ironclad.

05:10.300 --> 05:14.820
In this situation, if you were a poor, inefficient, or lazy worker, you would find that the union

05:14.820 --> 05:18.620
in this low-skilled work environment would certainly protect you from getting fired.

05:18.620 --> 05:22.400
And you would be handed your contract-allotted wage advancements like clockwork whether you

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
deserve them or not.

05:23.400 --> 05:28.100
But if you were a talented, quick, or enthusiastic worker, somebody who had the raw potential

05:28.100 --> 05:32.260
to rise the ranks on your own merit, the union structure itself would hold you back.

05:32.260 --> 05:35.780
It doesn't matter if you can push 10 times more product than meth-head Michael, he's

05:35.780 --> 05:39.160
been there 10 years and you've been here too, so he gets the promotion.

05:39.160 --> 05:43.580
In this environment, unions serve primarily to protect mediocrity, and such a workplace

05:43.580 --> 05:47.860
will see a regular turnover of their most promising workers as they move on to greener

05:47.860 --> 05:48.860
pastures.

05:48.860 --> 05:51.920
And this is where we get to that anti-individualist point I mentioned earlier.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.800
If you are somebody who's talented, skilled, or driven enough to be able to negotiate with

05:55.800 --> 05:59.920
your employer on your own merits, a union will only serve to hurt you, not help you.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.820
You won't have the option to stand apart or represent yourself.

06:02.820 --> 06:06.180
Your employer's hands will be bound by the contract, stating that they can only treat

06:06.180 --> 06:07.880
with you through the union apparatus.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.280
And the union's hands will be bound by the contract, putting more senior members of the

06:11.280 --> 06:12.320
union ahead of you.

06:12.320 --> 06:17.840
It is inherently anti-meritocratic, and in most cases, you have no choice but to be part

06:17.840 --> 06:20.200
of the union if you want the job, even if you don't want to be.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.160
Of course, socialists often make the false claim that employers will never, ever directly

06:25.160 --> 06:29.920
negotiate with individual employees, because employers always hold the cards in hiring.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.640
They believe this for two different reasons.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.640
One, because they're generally working in low-skilled jobs themselves, and have never

06:35.640 --> 06:38.300
seen a high-skilled worker negotiate for themselves.

06:38.300 --> 06:42.000
And two, because decades of mass immigration have flooded the labor market, depressing

06:42.000 --> 06:45.680
the price of labor for so long, people have largely forgotten what it's like when there's

06:45.680 --> 06:49.600
more jobs than workers, and employers have to fight over employees.

06:49.600 --> 06:54.040
After all, there's a reason that employers tend to poach employees from each other, and

06:54.040 --> 06:58.080
have non-disclosure and non-compete agreements in their employment contracts the higher up

06:58.080 --> 06:59.080
you go.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.680
It's because if you make yourself a valuable worker, whether that's through education,

07:02.680 --> 07:07.280
rare qualifications, industry connections, a good reputation, work ethic or intelligence,

07:07.280 --> 07:10.720
then eventually you will reach a tipping point where there is greater demand for your specialized

07:10.720 --> 07:12.800
skills and employers will compete to hire you.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.600
A great example of this is in the UK.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.480
If a building has historic importance, you need specialized qualifications to work on

07:18.480 --> 07:21.320
it, due to the nature of the materials and the architecture involved.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.440
Only seven people in the entire country have the license, and you can bet those seven control

07:25.440 --> 07:27.980
the market for their labor, not their employers.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.920
The point I'm making is, while a properly functioning union can help the lowest rung

07:31.920 --> 07:35.280
of workers, it will eventually hurt you the higher you climb.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.220
It raises the floor, but lowers the ceiling.

07:37.220 --> 07:40.240
This is why you're less and less likely to find a union presence the higher you climb

07:40.240 --> 07:44.520
in any organization, and why, eventually, the next promotion that you can take will

07:44.520 --> 07:47.200
require you leaving the union and going staff.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.280
But even for people at the bottom of the hierarchy, research shows unionized workers are less

07:51.280 --> 07:52.280
happy.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.800
Yeah, you know, I was surprised to read this too, but it actually kind of makes sense if

07:54.800 --> 07:55.800
you think about it.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.900
Many of the early studies suggest that union members are less satisfied than non-union

07:59.900 --> 08:03.120
workers, but are also less inclined to quit their jobs.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.340
This surprising finding has been considered an anomaly by many researchers, as unions

08:07.340 --> 08:11.420
should achieve better working conditions, which, common sense suggests, should lead

08:11.420 --> 08:13.040
to higher job satisfaction.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.320
The author's research helps answer the puzzle.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.240
In a recent meta-study, he found that unions don't seem to make workers less satisfied.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.560
Rather, workers who are likely to be dissatisfied, even after controlling for various aspects

08:23.560 --> 08:25.680
of their work, are more likely to join unions.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.120
And this makes sense, right?

08:27.120 --> 08:30.400
If you're satisfied with your job already, if you feel your wage is fair and you're

08:30.400 --> 08:33.500
being heard and taken care of, you're not going to need a union.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.800
Unions are things people advocate for if they feel like they're downtrodden, or they

08:36.800 --> 08:38.840
agitate for if they've been radicalized.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.840
However, the same research in this article shows that union workers who are more likely

08:42.840 --> 08:46.180
to be dissatisfied are also less likely to quit their jobs.

08:46.180 --> 08:49.000
This is surprising on its face, but it makes sense.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.640
Let's say you're in a non-union workplace, and your job is shitty.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.200
You approach your boss about suggestions to make it better, and your boss, being an asshole,

08:55.200 --> 08:57.880
tells you to shut up and get back to work because your voice doesn't matter.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.960
Now, controlling for variables like pay and benefits and the job market around you, there's

09:01.960 --> 09:05.400
a reasonable chance that you'd walk off the job right then and there, especially if

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400
you have a spine.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.220
But now let's say you're in a union workplace, and your job is shit.

09:09.220 --> 09:12.520
You approach your boss about suggestions to make it better, and your boss is still an

09:12.520 --> 09:16.400
asshole, but this time he says, well, the union provides for a worker suggestion box,

09:16.400 --> 09:17.680
so put your suggestion in there.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.200
You talk to your union rep, you file away your suggestion, which will never be read,

09:21.200 --> 09:25.000
and will be discarded immediately if it is, and then you go on working for another day.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.680
It's true that in a bad workplace, a union can serve to protect you from unjust firings,

09:28.680 --> 09:31.720
but it also serves to convince you not to quit when you've been slighted, because

09:31.720 --> 09:35.440
it grants you the illusion that you're being heard, that you're understood, that

09:35.440 --> 09:38.600
you're participating in something, when the truth is, the union rep and management

09:38.600 --> 09:40.720
are probably hanging out after hours laughing at you.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.120
I want it to be clear, I'm not strictly anti-union.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.120
They have their place, and they can do good.

09:45.120 --> 09:49.080
In fact, if you're a free marketeer, you should be pro-union, because collective bargaining

09:49.080 --> 09:51.720
is a market force, just like individual bargaining is.

09:51.720 --> 09:56.460
Free market only means that the state should not threaten individual free agents from acting

09:56.460 --> 09:58.420
freely at the barrel of a gun.

09:58.420 --> 10:01.620
It doesn't say that people can't come together to foreign unions, or companies.

10:01.620 --> 10:05.240
But this position that socialists have taken up, that unions are always good no matter

10:05.240 --> 10:09.200
what, and management will always be pure evil, is laughably stupid, and I love it when it

10:09.200 --> 10:10.540
blows up in their face.

10:10.540 --> 10:14.720
Like when Medium says that their workers attempt to unionize was just an amplification of cis

10:14.720 --> 10:19.540
white male voices, or when Kickstarter said their workers attempt to unionize was a misappropriation

10:19.540 --> 10:21.800
of unions for use by privileged workers.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.980
Yeah, you made this corporations go woke bed, and you can fucking lie in it.

10:25.980 --> 10:29.560
And of course it goes without saying that these people suddenly become violently anti-union

10:29.560 --> 10:32.400
when it's a police union, but that's a topic for another day.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.400
For better or worse, unions are falling out of style, and when it comes to that anti-individualist

10:36.400 --> 10:38.600
stance I mentioned earlier, I can see why.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.960
Consider this story.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.480
Instacart is firing every employee who voted to unionize.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.200
Sounds pretty bad, right?

10:44.200 --> 10:47.400
Instacart operates under a gig model like Uber and Lyft, who have both dealt with their

10:47.400 --> 10:48.920
own unionization woes.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.580
But consider that gig business model as compared to a traditional job.

10:52.580 --> 10:56.800
At a regular unionized workplace, like say at a grocery store, or a food packing plant,

10:56.800 --> 11:00.480
or some other blue collar job, you've got a union that protects you, but you still show

11:00.480 --> 11:03.240
up for the hours they schedule you, whether you like it or not.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.520
The whole purpose of an independent contractor job is that you can make your own hours.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.360
You don't want to work for Uber today?

11:08.360 --> 11:09.360
Well then don't.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.820
Set yourself unavailable on the app.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.280
Have plans at 7pm?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.840
Okay, work whenever you want and then call it a day when you're done.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.680
I know at-will employment is considered a dirty word in the States, but that doesn't

11:18.680 --> 11:22.140
just mean at-will for the employer, it also means at-will for the worker.

11:22.140 --> 11:26.200
These types of jobs have their drawbacks, but what they provide that a 9-5 unionized

11:26.200 --> 11:28.860
workplace does not is infinite flexibility.

11:28.860 --> 11:33.040
Some people consider content creators not to be self-employed, but to be employees of

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
YouTube or Twitch.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.280
I don't agree with that, but let's run with it.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.360
If we are employees, that means we're operating on a gig model, and I couldn't be happier

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
with it.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.400
If I post a video tomorrow, I don't post a video, and the responsibility of what happens

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
is on me.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
I don't get paid.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.040
I might lose out in the algorithm, whatever it is, but it's my choice, and I can come

11:50.040 --> 11:53.960
back the next day and post a video again without the possibility of getting fired by YouTube

11:53.960 --> 11:57.560
for a no-call no-show and having my channel given away to somebody else.

11:57.560 --> 12:01.960
The gig model is not for everybody, but for people with specific personalities or lifestyles

12:01.960 --> 12:06.000
it's perfect, and this drive to unionize everything is ruining the benefits for those

12:06.000 --> 12:08.400
attracted to this idea of working at their leisure.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.600
I think this stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of unions,

12:12.600 --> 12:14.440
where they are appropriate and where they are not.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.440
Case in point.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.660
No dude, simply not showing up to work is not striking, and it was good to fire you

12:19.660 --> 12:21.280
when you stopped doing your job.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.280
You're an idiot.

12:22.280 --> 12:27.360
Worst part is, all this union idiocy is probably going to end up hurting the good unions too.

12:27.360 --> 12:30.680
Walmart already aggressively union busts, and they're one of the shittiest employers

12:30.680 --> 12:31.680
around.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.940
I actually think Walmart's one of the places where you really should have a union and yet

12:33.940 --> 12:34.940
here we are.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.780
At the same time, Amazon has been employing some truly dystopian things, like tracking

12:38.780 --> 12:43.320
employees with heat sensors to try and determine pro-union sentiment, or taking advantage of

12:43.320 --> 12:46.900
workplace ethnic strife to prevent unionization attempts.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.820
Unions may be good in these situations, because Walmart and Amazon are both kind of shitty,

12:50.820 --> 12:54.260
but socialists have royally shit the bed on the union question to the point that your

12:54.260 --> 12:56.260
average person is never going to touch it.

12:56.260 --> 12:59.020
So yeah, that union vote failed.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.020
And you know what?

13:00.020 --> 13:01.020
It failed fair and square.

13:01.020 --> 13:04.080
No no no no no, don't call to stop counting the ballots.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.520
Don't complain that illegal ballot drop boxes invalidated the vote.

13:07.520 --> 13:12.160
Don't complain that large batches of ballots arrived at odd times, and it seemed suspicious

13:12.160 --> 13:13.360
that they would do so.

13:13.360 --> 13:18.120
Don't complain that Jeff Bezos himself was against the idea of mail-in voting as it would

13:18.120 --> 13:19.640
be considered unfair.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.760
Stop crying about it.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.840
This is normal election behavior.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.760
Amazon is just fortifying the vote, and leftists are just conspiracy theorists who are butt

13:26.760 --> 13:29.480
mad that they lost.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.480
Sound familiar?

13:31.480 --> 13:33.060
