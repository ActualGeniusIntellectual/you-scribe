1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Here's a common way that remainers frame Brexit.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,800
Like a parent of a wayward young adult, who's determined to hurt themselves by their behaviour.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,360
I watch Broken Hearted.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,300
The really sad thing about Brexit is that over the next 10-15 years, we will slowly

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,440
realize what we have lost, and why we joined in the first place.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,560
Like your parents telling you your school day is the best years of your life, and you

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,040
don't believe them until it's too late.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,200
Brexit really does spell the end of the UK.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
So sad.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,240
Like hearing divorcing parents tell kids we'll be friends.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Umm...

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,220
Everyone marching at London Pride?

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,960
Are you... are you fucking a chicken down there?

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,400
To the remainers, the UK is an uppity child, a hormonal teenager, while the EU is the wise,

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
benevolent father.

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,560
The UK's desire for freedom from the EU is rash, misinformed, immature, and can only

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,600
lead to disaster.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,900
A specific type of disaster that only the experience of the EU, and the remainers advocating

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,520
for it, can foresee.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,880
And maybe that's the case.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,600
When or if Brexit happens, everyone agrees that the UK will take an economic hit.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
And the pragmatic argument of staying in the EU to avoid a short to middle term depression

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,160
is a reasonable one.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,120
Just like not all Brexiteers are racists, not all remainers are card-carrying progressives.

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,800
A lot of them just want to avoid a very obvious economic pitfall.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,880
But the primary argument for Brexit, at least as far as I can tell, is the desire of the

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,200
citizens of the UK to reclaim the sovereignty of their own country.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
It's so that the UK is ruled by their own parliament, in London.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,480
And so that parliament is the highest legal authority in the land, and not subordinate

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,040
to an even greater power structure within the EU.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,220
The EU is notoriously undemocratic.

32
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,700
The only body of the EU directly elected by the citizens is the European Parliament.

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,320
And unlike an actual parliamentary democracy, the European Parliament does not have the

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,560
right of initiative, the right to put forward legislation for a vote.

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,200
The European Parliament can only approve or reject if legislation handed to them from

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
the European Commission.

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
Compare this to the Canadian system, where the House of Commons has the right of initiative,

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
but the Senate does not.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,480
Or the American one, where both Congress and the Senate have the right, but both houses

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,000
must approve any bill regardless of where it starts.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,680
In both examples, at least one body has both the right of initiative, and is directly democratically

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,180
elected by the population.

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,880
This is not the case with the EU.

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,920
Most Brexiteers recognize this situation as unacceptable for a free country, and want

45
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,240
to return the sovereign power to their own parliament.

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,040
Their position is primarily focused on the right of self-determination, not secondary

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,480
issues like immigration or economics.

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,800
Often times, when you engage your remainer online, their default position will be that

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,380
Brexiteers are simply angry racists.

50
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,940
When you bring up the issue of sovereignty, they almost always go silent, because they

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,220
know there's no real argument against the right of self-determination.

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,760
The progressive go-to on self-determination for the past 50 years was that more methods

53
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,000
of living were valid beyond the narrow interpretation provided by religious traditionalism, and

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,120
that people had the right to live in an unorthodox or unpopular manner.

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,120
The smartest among them know to simply clam up when people choose to exercise their rights

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,240
to, say, leave the EU.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,720
But that's not always how it goes down.

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,080
In a minority of cases, when presented with a sovereignty argument, the remainer will

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,540
reply in the manner that I began this video with.

60
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,000
The UK's desire for freedom over security is childish, and the patient parent that is

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the EU will be saddened, but will allow their wayward son to destroy themselves.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,240
And a significant portion of the British electorate are complicit in this infantilization of their

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
character.

64
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,320
The idea that the British, as a people, are perpetual children that need tending to by

65
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,240
their European parents, has taken root quite strongly ever since those same children voted

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
to leave the EU.

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,120
I mean, there's a lot of contradictions here.

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,980
The British are simultaneously the greatest colonial tyrants the world has ever seen,

69
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,080
as well as a baby race requiring a firm European hand.

70
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,520
Or that the prevailing metaphor for the situation is Britain represented by the rashness of

71
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,640
youth when it was overwhelmingly older people who voted to leave.

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,240
But forget about that stuff, it doesn't matter.

73
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,520
This idea that the citizens need constant guiding by a nanny state is overwhelmingly

74
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,860
the most prevailing position within both the government and the media.

75
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,440
Hate incidents that do not break any laws but are considered to be wrongful uses of

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,400
free speech are met with a friendly visit from the police.

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,620
Lawful speech ranging from peaceful protests to comedy to rational critique of sensitive

78
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,580
topics are all stifled under the guise of safety.

79
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,000
Violent or sexual content, something legal that any adult should be allowed to partake

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,720
in, is slowly becoming banned.

81
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,880
The entire British Isles is becoming childproofed, with caps on the power outlets and cushioned

82
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,620
corners on the coffee tables.

83
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,580
And this care-for-me mentality has filtered into the UK's parliament, which is one big

84
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,980
reason why they don't want to deliver Brexit.

85
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,580
Doing so means they'll actually be in charge of running the place.

86
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,840
What they do will have serious impact with serious consequences, and require serious

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,500
responsibility from them in order to do their jobs.

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,540
They won't simply be the EU's rubber stamp, they'll be the ultimate authority, and frankly

89
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,780
the British MPs right now don't want the pressure.

90
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,160
That's why they're all having a collective breakdown at the prospect.

91
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,500
Expending so much energy betraying the people that voted them in is finally getting to them,

92
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
I guess.

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,660
The prodigal son metaphor is one that remainers like to use, when framing the EU as a benevolent

94
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,900
authority and the UK as a bratty kid.

95
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,500
I wish the UK would just acknowledge that Brexit is just a bad idea, and stop this disaster

96
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
from happening.

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,780
I think the EU is waiting with open arms, ready to welcome the UK back like the prodigal

98
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
son.

99
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,940
The prodigal son, for those of you who don't know, is a bible story.

100
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,820
A wealthy father has two sons.

101
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,960
The younger son asks for his inheritance early, receives it, and promptly goes out and wastes

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,040
it all frivolously.

103
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,280
He experiences destitution and hardship, and returns home, hat in hand, expecting to be

104
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,440
a servant of the family.

105
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,300
Instead, his father welcomes him home, telling his angered older son that the younger one

106
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,740
has finally learned humility.

107
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,240
The lesson is obvious, God forgives those who sin and repent.

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,200
The problem with using the story for a real world scenario like Brexit, though, is that

109
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,360
the EU is not God.

110
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,280
In real life, all children eventually leave the nest.

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,960
If the argument is that the UK's desire for freedom from the EU is fundamentally childish,

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,420
that would imply that the UK is destined to eventually leave the EU, if not now, then

113
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,080
a little bit later, when the UK is a bit more mature and the EU is a bit closer to death.

114
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,200
And frankly, the EU is close enough, isn't it?

115
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,600
But okay, Remainers, if we're going to use the bible to describe the situation, let's

116
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
use the bible.

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,640
Let's talk about the Tower of Babel.

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,360
You know, where humans got too proud of their accomplishments, built a giant tower to try

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,960
and reach heaven, and God decided to teach them a lesson by destroying the tower and

120
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,000
forcing all the people to speak different languages.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm an atheist.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,560
I don't care about the religious implications of the Babel story.

123
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,640
For someone like me, the meaning is quite clear.

124
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,560
The biggest threat to humanity, with the exception of the chaotic nature of reality, is the tendency

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,220
for human social structures to become too large, too slow, and too blind.

126
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,980
And when that happens, they are inevitably doomed to disintegration and collapse.

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,320
This is, for example, why libertarians prefer smaller government, because they understand

128
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,720
that an excessively large government has a tendency to overreach, overconsume, and eventually

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,000
implode under the weight of their own bureaucracy.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,800
We can see this in the EU, a large, unwieldy superstate, enduring a financial crisis due

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,760
to its rapid expansion into Eastern Europe.

132
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,520
Its disintegration and collapse has begun in the form of Brexit, where its constituent

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,620
parts are slowly deciding that the grand European project is too much trouble in its worth,

134
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,360
and are all looking to go their own ways, like humanity after the destruction of Babel.

135
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,440
People who use terminology like crashing out of the EU to refer to a hard Brexit know this

136
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
implicitly.

137
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,920
They know that even the simple act of leaving the EU will cause catastrophic damage to the

138
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
cause.

139
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,440
That's why, before the referendum, the common position was that the UK has an obligation

140
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,760
to not destroy the EU by leaving it.

141
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,220
Of course, to some degree, the modern world, with its modern problems, requires more complex

142
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,760
solutions than ever before, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a simplistic government

143
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,480
that can pull off a complex solution.

144
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,060
But the answer isn't to build a Tower of Babel, an ever-increasing, all-consuming European

145
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,580
nightmare state, lacking democratic representation, and aspiring to be an empire.

146
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,760
The solution is, as far as I can tell, an attitude of humility and leadership.

147
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,880
Think of it this way.

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,080
Jordan Peterson's now-iconic meme of Clean Your Room has caught on.

149
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,600
Because before you announced your grand plans to create the utopia through top-down management

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,080
of the entire planet, you should probably be capable of keeping your living space in

151
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
order first.

152
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,040
Keeping yourself clean is infinitely easier than keeping the world clean, and often enough

153
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,960
the type of person that desires radical action to implement the latter can't even do the

154
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
former.

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,120
For example, the EU is on the verge of collapse.

156
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,880
Is it no surprise that the president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has an alcohol problem?

157
00:08:50,120 --> 00:09:05,760
Or that European Parliament advocate for a federalized Europe, Guy Verhofstadt, tries

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,000
in vain to look 30 years younger than he is, while demanding that the EU member states

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:30,760
give the EU more sovereign power?

160
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,960
The fundamental problem is that the EU is dysfunctional, but it works just well enough

161
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,960
that the clowns in power think they understand it, when they don't.

162
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,080
And they believe that their limited understanding allows them to manipulate the system to induce

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,620
grand social change, when all it really creates is grand social disaster.

164
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,720
Of course, social systems require adjustment in order to properly function, and on some

165
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
level those social systems are required.

166
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,380
But in that adjustment, humility comes into play, because the EU has shown us that simply

167
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,040
marching in like you own the place more often than not leads to ruin.

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,840
In politics, humility manifests as a desire to improve things, yes, but also as an understanding

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,200
that being careful means sticking with what you know and starting out small, hence clean

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
your room.

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,880
Or in the case of Juncker and Verhofstadt, clean up your axe.

172
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,400
This is why there is an insistence to infantilize Britain due to the British desire to leave

173
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
the EU.

174
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,880
Europe views itself as the competent, wizened adult, even though it's really, really not.

175
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,500
So child is the only role that the UK can be cast in.

176
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,000
But unlike the prodigal son, the EU and the UK are not father and child.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
No maturity on the part of the EU is necessary for the two partners to break up.

178
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,440
In fact, a breakup is probably a better metaphor, isn't it?

179
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Think about it.

180
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
You've got two partners.

181
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,920
And yeah, the UK is the woman in the relationship.

182
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,720
The EU makes way more money, and the breakup is going to be tough on the UK.

183
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,640
She'll have to leave his house and live in a dumpy apartment for a while.

184
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
But she's no slouch either.

185
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
She can land on her feet.

186
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,040
And she's got many reasons to leave, too.

187
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Abuse?

188
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Gaslighting?

189
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Treating her like a child and not a partner, perhaps?

190
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,560
If you ever needed more proof that the EU was a bad boyfriend after all, look at his

191
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,480
clingy desperate behavior after she told him that they were through.

192
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
Come on, don't tell me these clowns don't look like they were nice guys back in college.

193
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
A culture of safety has resulted in a class of British adults who, rather than deal with

194
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,460
their own affairs, appeal to an ever-greater authority, from parent, to boss, to state,

195
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,520
to super-state.

196
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,840
And the EU, with all of its flaws and cracks, has gladly taken up the mantle of ultimate

197
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,020
eternal authority.

198
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,780
It hardly deserves such a position.

199
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,260
For Brexit to be opposed, for the legitimate criticisms of the European project to be ignored,

200
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,660
the infantilization of Britain is necessary, both internally and externally, because the

201
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,180
only way for the EU to survive is to say to the British, quiet, the adults are talking.
