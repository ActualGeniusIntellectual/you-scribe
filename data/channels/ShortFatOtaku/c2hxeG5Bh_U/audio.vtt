00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
Here's a common way that remainers frame Brexit.

00:02.700 --> 00:06.800
Like a parent of a wayward young adult, who's determined to hurt themselves by their behaviour.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.360
I watch Broken Hearted.

00:08.360 --> 00:12.300
The really sad thing about Brexit is that over the next 10-15 years, we will slowly

00:12.300 --> 00:15.440
realize what we have lost, and why we joined in the first place.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.560
Like your parents telling you your school day is the best years of your life, and you

00:18.560 --> 00:20.040
don't believe them until it's too late.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.200
Brexit really does spell the end of the UK.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
So sad.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.240
Like hearing divorcing parents tell kids we'll be friends.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.240
Umm...

00:27.240 --> 00:30.220
Everyone marching at London Pride?

00:30.220 --> 00:32.960
Are you... are you fucking a chicken down there?

00:32.960 --> 00:38.400
To the remainers, the UK is an uppity child, a hormonal teenager, while the EU is the wise,

00:38.400 --> 00:39.400
benevolent father.

00:39.400 --> 00:44.560
The UK's desire for freedom from the EU is rash, misinformed, immature, and can only

00:44.560 --> 00:45.600
lead to disaster.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.900
A specific type of disaster that only the experience of the EU, and the remainers advocating

00:49.900 --> 00:51.520
for it, can foresee.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.880
And maybe that's the case.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.600
When or if Brexit happens, everyone agrees that the UK will take an economic hit.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.760
And the pragmatic argument of staying in the EU to avoid a short to middle term depression

01:01.760 --> 01:03.160
is a reasonable one.

01:03.160 --> 01:08.120
Just like not all Brexiteers are racists, not all remainers are card-carrying progressives.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.800
A lot of them just want to avoid a very obvious economic pitfall.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.880
But the primary argument for Brexit, at least as far as I can tell, is the desire of the

01:15.880 --> 01:19.200
citizens of the UK to reclaim the sovereignty of their own country.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.400
It's so that the UK is ruled by their own parliament, in London.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.480
And so that parliament is the highest legal authority in the land, and not subordinate

01:26.480 --> 01:29.040
to an even greater power structure within the EU.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.220
The EU is notoriously undemocratic.

01:31.220 --> 01:35.700
The only body of the EU directly elected by the citizens is the European Parliament.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.320
And unlike an actual parliamentary democracy, the European Parliament does not have the

01:39.320 --> 01:42.560
right of initiative, the right to put forward legislation for a vote.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.200
The European Parliament can only approve or reject if legislation handed to them from

01:46.200 --> 01:47.520
the European Commission.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.880
Compare this to the Canadian system, where the House of Commons has the right of initiative,

01:50.880 --> 01:51.880
but the Senate does not.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.480
Or the American one, where both Congress and the Senate have the right, but both houses

01:55.480 --> 01:58.000
must approve any bill regardless of where it starts.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.680
In both examples, at least one body has both the right of initiative, and is directly democratically

02:03.680 --> 02:05.180
elected by the population.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.880
This is not the case with the EU.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.920
Most Brexiteers recognize this situation as unacceptable for a free country, and want

02:10.920 --> 02:13.240
to return the sovereign power to their own parliament.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.040
Their position is primarily focused on the right of self-determination, not secondary

02:17.040 --> 02:19.480
issues like immigration or economics.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.800
Often times, when you engage your remainer online, their default position will be that

02:22.800 --> 02:25.380
Brexiteers are simply angry racists.

02:25.380 --> 02:28.940
When you bring up the issue of sovereignty, they almost always go silent, because they

02:28.940 --> 02:32.220
know there's no real argument against the right of self-determination.

02:32.220 --> 02:36.760
The progressive go-to on self-determination for the past 50 years was that more methods

02:36.760 --> 02:41.000
of living were valid beyond the narrow interpretation provided by religious traditionalism, and

02:41.000 --> 02:44.120
that people had the right to live in an unorthodox or unpopular manner.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.120
The smartest among them know to simply clam up when people choose to exercise their rights

02:48.120 --> 02:50.240
to, say, leave the EU.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.720
But that's not always how it goes down.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.080
In a minority of cases, when presented with a sovereignty argument, the remainer will

02:55.080 --> 02:57.540
reply in the manner that I began this video with.

02:57.540 --> 03:02.000
The UK's desire for freedom over security is childish, and the patient parent that is

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
the EU will be saddened, but will allow their wayward son to destroy themselves.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.240
And a significant portion of the British electorate are complicit in this infantilization of their

03:10.240 --> 03:11.240
character.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.320
The idea that the British, as a people, are perpetual children that need tending to by

03:14.320 --> 03:19.240
their European parents, has taken root quite strongly ever since those same children voted

03:19.240 --> 03:20.240
to leave the EU.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.120
I mean, there's a lot of contradictions here.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.980
The British are simultaneously the greatest colonial tyrants the world has ever seen,

03:25.980 --> 03:29.080
as well as a baby race requiring a firm European hand.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.520
Or that the prevailing metaphor for the situation is Britain represented by the rashness of

03:32.520 --> 03:35.640
youth when it was overwhelmingly older people who voted to leave.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.240
But forget about that stuff, it doesn't matter.

03:37.240 --> 03:41.520
This idea that the citizens need constant guiding by a nanny state is overwhelmingly

03:41.520 --> 03:44.860
the most prevailing position within both the government and the media.

03:44.860 --> 03:48.440
Hate incidents that do not break any laws but are considered to be wrongful uses of

03:48.440 --> 03:51.400
free speech are met with a friendly visit from the police.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.620
Lawful speech ranging from peaceful protests to comedy to rational critique of sensitive

03:55.620 --> 03:58.580
topics are all stifled under the guise of safety.

03:58.580 --> 04:02.000
Violent or sexual content, something legal that any adult should be allowed to partake

04:02.000 --> 04:03.720
in, is slowly becoming banned.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.880
The entire British Isles is becoming childproofed, with caps on the power outlets and cushioned

04:07.880 --> 04:09.620
corners on the coffee tables.

04:09.620 --> 04:13.580
And this care-for-me mentality has filtered into the UK's parliament, which is one big

04:13.580 --> 04:15.980
reason why they don't want to deliver Brexit.

04:15.980 --> 04:18.580
Doing so means they'll actually be in charge of running the place.

04:18.580 --> 04:22.840
What they do will have serious impact with serious consequences, and require serious

04:22.840 --> 04:25.500
responsibility from them in order to do their jobs.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.540
They won't simply be the EU's rubber stamp, they'll be the ultimate authority, and frankly

04:29.540 --> 04:31.780
the British MPs right now don't want the pressure.

04:31.780 --> 04:35.160
That's why they're all having a collective breakdown at the prospect.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.500
Expending so much energy betraying the people that voted them in is finally getting to them,

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
I guess.

04:39.500 --> 04:43.660
The prodigal son metaphor is one that remainers like to use, when framing the EU as a benevolent

04:43.660 --> 04:45.900
authority and the UK as a bratty kid.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.500
I wish the UK would just acknowledge that Brexit is just a bad idea, and stop this disaster

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
from happening.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.780
I think the EU is waiting with open arms, ready to welcome the UK back like the prodigal

04:55.780 --> 04:56.780
son.

04:56.780 --> 04:58.940
The prodigal son, for those of you who don't know, is a bible story.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.820
A wealthy father has two sons.

05:00.820 --> 05:04.960
The younger son asks for his inheritance early, receives it, and promptly goes out and wastes

05:04.960 --> 05:06.040
it all frivolously.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.280
He experiences destitution and hardship, and returns home, hat in hand, expecting to be

05:10.280 --> 05:11.440
a servant of the family.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.300
Instead, his father welcomes him home, telling his angered older son that the younger one

05:15.300 --> 05:16.740
has finally learned humility.

05:16.740 --> 05:20.240
The lesson is obvious, God forgives those who sin and repent.

05:20.240 --> 05:24.200
The problem with using the story for a real world scenario like Brexit, though, is that

05:24.200 --> 05:26.360
the EU is not God.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.280
In real life, all children eventually leave the nest.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.960
If the argument is that the UK's desire for freedom from the EU is fundamentally childish,

05:33.960 --> 05:38.420
that would imply that the UK is destined to eventually leave the EU, if not now, then

05:38.420 --> 05:43.080
a little bit later, when the UK is a bit more mature and the EU is a bit closer to death.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.200
And frankly, the EU is close enough, isn't it?

05:45.200 --> 05:48.600
But okay, Remainers, if we're going to use the bible to describe the situation, let's

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
use the bible.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.640
Let's talk about the Tower of Babel.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.360
You know, where humans got too proud of their accomplishments, built a giant tower to try

05:54.360 --> 05:57.960
and reach heaven, and God decided to teach them a lesson by destroying the tower and

05:57.960 --> 06:00.000
forcing all the people to speak different languages.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm an atheist.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.560
I don't care about the religious implications of the Babel story.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.640
For someone like me, the meaning is quite clear.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.560
The biggest threat to humanity, with the exception of the chaotic nature of reality, is the tendency

06:09.560 --> 06:13.220
for human social structures to become too large, too slow, and too blind.

06:13.220 --> 06:16.980
And when that happens, they are inevitably doomed to disintegration and collapse.

06:16.980 --> 06:20.320
This is, for example, why libertarians prefer smaller government, because they understand

06:20.320 --> 06:24.720
that an excessively large government has a tendency to overreach, overconsume, and eventually

06:24.720 --> 06:27.000
implode under the weight of their own bureaucracy.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.800
We can see this in the EU, a large, unwieldy superstate, enduring a financial crisis due

06:31.800 --> 06:33.760
to its rapid expansion into Eastern Europe.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.520
Its disintegration and collapse has begun in the form of Brexit, where its constituent

06:37.520 --> 06:41.620
parts are slowly deciding that the grand European project is too much trouble in its worth,

06:41.620 --> 06:45.360
and are all looking to go their own ways, like humanity after the destruction of Babel.

06:45.360 --> 06:50.440
People who use terminology like crashing out of the EU to refer to a hard Brexit know this

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
implicitly.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.920
They know that even the simple act of leaving the EU will cause catastrophic damage to the

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
cause.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.440
That's why, before the referendum, the common position was that the UK has an obligation

07:00.440 --> 07:02.760
to not destroy the EU by leaving it.

07:02.760 --> 07:07.220
Of course, to some degree, the modern world, with its modern problems, requires more complex

07:07.220 --> 07:10.760
solutions than ever before, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a simplistic government

07:10.760 --> 07:12.480
that can pull off a complex solution.

07:12.480 --> 07:17.060
But the answer isn't to build a Tower of Babel, an ever-increasing, all-consuming European

07:17.060 --> 07:21.580
nightmare state, lacking democratic representation, and aspiring to be an empire.

07:21.580 --> 07:25.760
The solution is, as far as I can tell, an attitude of humility and leadership.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.880
Think of it this way.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.080
Jordan Peterson's now-iconic meme of Clean Your Room has caught on.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.600
Because before you announced your grand plans to create the utopia through top-down management

07:34.600 --> 07:38.080
of the entire planet, you should probably be capable of keeping your living space in

07:38.080 --> 07:39.120
order first.

07:39.120 --> 07:43.040
Keeping yourself clean is infinitely easier than keeping the world clean, and often enough

07:43.040 --> 07:46.960
the type of person that desires radical action to implement the latter can't even do the

07:46.960 --> 07:47.960
former.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.120
For example, the EU is on the verge of collapse.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.880
Is it no surprise that the president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has an alcohol problem?

08:50.120 --> 09:05.760
Or that European Parliament advocate for a federalized Europe, Guy Verhofstadt, tries

09:05.760 --> 09:10.000
in vain to look 30 years younger than he is, while demanding that the EU member states

09:10.000 --> 09:30.760
give the EU more sovereign power?

09:30.760 --> 09:34.960
The fundamental problem is that the EU is dysfunctional, but it works just well enough

09:34.960 --> 09:37.960
that the clowns in power think they understand it, when they don't.

09:37.960 --> 09:42.080
And they believe that their limited understanding allows them to manipulate the system to induce

09:42.080 --> 09:46.620
grand social change, when all it really creates is grand social disaster.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.720
Of course, social systems require adjustment in order to properly function, and on some

09:50.720 --> 09:52.720
level those social systems are required.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.380
But in that adjustment, humility comes into play, because the EU has shown us that simply

09:56.380 --> 10:00.040
marching in like you own the place more often than not leads to ruin.

10:00.040 --> 10:04.840
In politics, humility manifests as a desire to improve things, yes, but also as an understanding

10:04.840 --> 10:09.200
that being careful means sticking with what you know and starting out small, hence clean

10:09.200 --> 10:10.200
your room.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.880
Or in the case of Juncker and Verhofstadt, clean up your axe.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.400
This is why there is an insistence to infantilize Britain due to the British desire to leave

10:16.400 --> 10:17.400
the EU.

10:17.400 --> 10:21.880
Europe views itself as the competent, wizened adult, even though it's really, really not.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.500
So child is the only role that the UK can be cast in.

10:24.500 --> 10:28.000
But unlike the prodigal son, the EU and the UK are not father and child.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.600
No maturity on the part of the EU is necessary for the two partners to break up.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.440
In fact, a breakup is probably a better metaphor, isn't it?

10:34.440 --> 10:35.440
Think about it.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.440
You've got two partners.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.920
And yeah, the UK is the woman in the relationship.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.720
The EU makes way more money, and the breakup is going to be tough on the UK.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.640
She'll have to leave his house and live in a dumpy apartment for a while.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.640
But she's no slouch either.

10:44.640 --> 10:45.640
She can land on her feet.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.040
And she's got many reasons to leave, too.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.040
Abuse?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.040
Gaslighting?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
Treating her like a child and not a partner, perhaps?

10:52.040 --> 10:55.560
If you ever needed more proof that the EU was a bad boyfriend after all, look at his

10:55.560 --> 10:58.480
clingy desperate behavior after she told him that they were through.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.800
Come on, don't tell me these clowns don't look like they were nice guys back in college.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.120
A culture of safety has resulted in a class of British adults who, rather than deal with

11:07.120 --> 11:12.460
their own affairs, appeal to an ever-greater authority, from parent, to boss, to state,

11:12.460 --> 11:13.520
to super-state.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.840
And the EU, with all of its flaws and cracks, has gladly taken up the mantle of ultimate

11:17.840 --> 11:19.020
eternal authority.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.780
It hardly deserves such a position.

11:20.780 --> 11:25.260
For Brexit to be opposed, for the legitimate criticisms of the European project to be ignored,

11:25.260 --> 11:29.660
the infantilization of Britain is necessary, both internally and externally, because the

11:29.660 --> 11:34.180
only way for the EU to survive is to say to the British, quiet, the adults are talking.
