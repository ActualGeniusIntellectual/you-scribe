0	2700	Here's a common way that remainers frame Brexit.
2700	6800	Like a parent of a wayward young adult, who's determined to hurt themselves by their behaviour.
6800	8360	I watch Broken Hearted.
8360	12300	The really sad thing about Brexit is that over the next 10-15 years, we will slowly
12300	15440	realize what we have lost, and why we joined in the first place.
15440	18560	Like your parents telling you your school day is the best years of your life, and you
18560	20040	don't believe them until it's too late.
20040	22200	Brexit really does spell the end of the UK.
22200	23200	So sad.
23200	26240	Like hearing divorcing parents tell kids we'll be friends.
26240	27240	Umm...
27240	30220	Everyone marching at London Pride?
30220	32960	Are you... are you fucking a chicken down there?
32960	38400	To the remainers, the UK is an uppity child, a hormonal teenager, while the EU is the wise,
38400	39400	benevolent father.
39400	44560	The UK's desire for freedom from the EU is rash, misinformed, immature, and can only
44560	45600	lead to disaster.
45600	49900	A specific type of disaster that only the experience of the EU, and the remainers advocating
49900	51520	for it, can foresee.
51520	52880	And maybe that's the case.
52880	57600	When or if Brexit happens, everyone agrees that the UK will take an economic hit.
57600	61760	And the pragmatic argument of staying in the EU to avoid a short to middle term depression
61760	63160	is a reasonable one.
63160	68120	Just like not all Brexiteers are racists, not all remainers are card-carrying progressives.
68120	71800	A lot of them just want to avoid a very obvious economic pitfall.
71800	75880	But the primary argument for Brexit, at least as far as I can tell, is the desire of the
75880	79200	citizens of the UK to reclaim the sovereignty of their own country.
79200	82400	It's so that the UK is ruled by their own parliament, in London.
82440	86480	And so that parliament is the highest legal authority in the land, and not subordinate
86480	89040	to an even greater power structure within the EU.
89040	91220	The EU is notoriously undemocratic.
91220	95700	The only body of the EU directly elected by the citizens is the European Parliament.
95700	99320	And unlike an actual parliamentary democracy, the European Parliament does not have the
99320	102560	right of initiative, the right to put forward legislation for a vote.
102560	106200	The European Parliament can only approve or reject if legislation handed to them from
106200	107520	the European Commission.
107520	110880	Compare this to the Canadian system, where the House of Commons has the right of initiative,
110880	111880	but the Senate does not.
111880	115480	Or the American one, where both Congress and the Senate have the right, but both houses
115480	118000	must approve any bill regardless of where it starts.
118000	123680	In both examples, at least one body has both the right of initiative, and is directly democratically
123680	125180	elected by the population.
125180	126880	This is not the case with the EU.
126880	130920	Most Brexiteers recognize this situation as unacceptable for a free country, and want
130920	133240	to return the sovereign power to their own parliament.
133240	137040	Their position is primarily focused on the right of self-determination, not secondary
137040	139480	issues like immigration or economics.
139480	142800	Often times, when you engage your remainer online, their default position will be that
142800	145380	Brexiteers are simply angry racists.
145380	148940	When you bring up the issue of sovereignty, they almost always go silent, because they
148940	152220	know there's no real argument against the right of self-determination.
152220	156760	The progressive go-to on self-determination for the past 50 years was that more methods
156760	161000	of living were valid beyond the narrow interpretation provided by religious traditionalism, and
161000	164120	that people had the right to live in an unorthodox or unpopular manner.
164120	168120	The smartest among them know to simply clam up when people choose to exercise their rights
168120	170240	to, say, leave the EU.
170240	171720	But that's not always how it goes down.
171720	175080	In a minority of cases, when presented with a sovereignty argument, the remainer will
175080	177540	reply in the manner that I began this video with.
177540	182000	The UK's desire for freedom over security is childish, and the patient parent that is
182000	186000	the EU will be saddened, but will allow their wayward son to destroy themselves.
186000	190240	And a significant portion of the British electorate are complicit in this infantilization of their
190240	191240	character.
191240	194320	The idea that the British, as a people, are perpetual children that need tending to by
194320	199240	their European parents, has taken root quite strongly ever since those same children voted
199240	200240	to leave the EU.
200240	202120	I mean, there's a lot of contradictions here.
202120	205980	The British are simultaneously the greatest colonial tyrants the world has ever seen,
205980	209080	as well as a baby race requiring a firm European hand.
209080	212520	Or that the prevailing metaphor for the situation is Britain represented by the rashness of
212520	215640	youth when it was overwhelmingly older people who voted to leave.
215640	217240	But forget about that stuff, it doesn't matter.
217240	221520	This idea that the citizens need constant guiding by a nanny state is overwhelmingly
221520	224860	the most prevailing position within both the government and the media.
224860	228440	Hate incidents that do not break any laws but are considered to be wrongful uses of
228440	231400	free speech are met with a friendly visit from the police.
231400	235620	Lawful speech ranging from peaceful protests to comedy to rational critique of sensitive
235620	238580	topics are all stifled under the guise of safety.
238580	242000	Violent or sexual content, something legal that any adult should be allowed to partake
242000	243720	in, is slowly becoming banned.
243720	247880	The entire British Isles is becoming childproofed, with caps on the power outlets and cushioned
247880	249620	corners on the coffee tables.
249620	253580	And this care-for-me mentality has filtered into the UK's parliament, which is one big
253580	255980	reason why they don't want to deliver Brexit.
255980	258580	Doing so means they'll actually be in charge of running the place.
258580	262840	What they do will have serious impact with serious consequences, and require serious
262840	265500	responsibility from them in order to do their jobs.
265500	269540	They won't simply be the EU's rubber stamp, they'll be the ultimate authority, and frankly
269540	271780	the British MPs right now don't want the pressure.
271780	275160	That's why they're all having a collective breakdown at the prospect.
275160	278500	Expending so much energy betraying the people that voted them in is finally getting to them,
278500	279500	I guess.
279500	283660	The prodigal son metaphor is one that remainers like to use, when framing the EU as a benevolent
283660	285900	authority and the UK as a bratty kid.
285900	290500	I wish the UK would just acknowledge that Brexit is just a bad idea, and stop this disaster
290500	291500	from happening.
291500	295780	I think the EU is waiting with open arms, ready to welcome the UK back like the prodigal
295780	296780	son.
296780	298940	The prodigal son, for those of you who don't know, is a bible story.
298940	300820	A wealthy father has two sons.
300820	304960	The younger son asks for his inheritance early, receives it, and promptly goes out and wastes
304960	306040	it all frivolously.
306040	310280	He experiences destitution and hardship, and returns home, hat in hand, expecting to be
310280	311440	a servant of the family.
311440	315300	Instead, his father welcomes him home, telling his angered older son that the younger one
315300	316740	has finally learned humility.
316740	320240	The lesson is obvious, God forgives those who sin and repent.
320240	324200	The problem with using the story for a real world scenario like Brexit, though, is that
324200	326360	the EU is not God.
326360	329280	In real life, all children eventually leave the nest.
329280	333960	If the argument is that the UK's desire for freedom from the EU is fundamentally childish,
333960	338420	that would imply that the UK is destined to eventually leave the EU, if not now, then
338420	343080	a little bit later, when the UK is a bit more mature and the EU is a bit closer to death.
343080	345200	And frankly, the EU is close enough, isn't it?
345200	348600	But okay, Remainers, if we're going to use the bible to describe the situation, let's
348600	349600	use the bible.
349600	350640	Let's talk about the Tower of Babel.
350640	354360	You know, where humans got too proud of their accomplishments, built a giant tower to try
354360	357960	and reach heaven, and God decided to teach them a lesson by destroying the tower and
357960	360000	forcing all the people to speak different languages.
360000	361000	I'm an atheist.
361000	363560	I don't care about the religious implications of the Babel story.
363560	365640	For someone like me, the meaning is quite clear.
365640	369560	The biggest threat to humanity, with the exception of the chaotic nature of reality, is the tendency
369560	373220	for human social structures to become too large, too slow, and too blind.
373220	376980	And when that happens, they are inevitably doomed to disintegration and collapse.
376980	380320	This is, for example, why libertarians prefer smaller government, because they understand
380320	384720	that an excessively large government has a tendency to overreach, overconsume, and eventually
384720	387000	implode under the weight of their own bureaucracy.
387000	391800	We can see this in the EU, a large, unwieldy superstate, enduring a financial crisis due
391800	393760	to its rapid expansion into Eastern Europe.
393760	397520	Its disintegration and collapse has begun in the form of Brexit, where its constituent
397520	401620	parts are slowly deciding that the grand European project is too much trouble in its worth,
401620	405360	and are all looking to go their own ways, like humanity after the destruction of Babel.
405360	410440	People who use terminology like crashing out of the EU to refer to a hard Brexit know this
410440	411440	implicitly.
411440	415920	They know that even the simple act of leaving the EU will cause catastrophic damage to the
415920	416920	cause.
416920	420440	That's why, before the referendum, the common position was that the UK has an obligation
420440	422760	to not destroy the EU by leaving it.
422760	427220	Of course, to some degree, the modern world, with its modern problems, requires more complex
427220	430760	solutions than ever before, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a simplistic government
430760	432480	that can pull off a complex solution.
432480	437060	But the answer isn't to build a Tower of Babel, an ever-increasing, all-consuming European
437060	441580	nightmare state, lacking democratic representation, and aspiring to be an empire.
441580	445760	The solution is, as far as I can tell, an attitude of humility and leadership.
445760	446880	Think of it this way.
446880	451080	Jordan Peterson's now-iconic meme of Clean Your Room has caught on.
451080	454600	Because before you announced your grand plans to create the utopia through top-down management
454600	458080	of the entire planet, you should probably be capable of keeping your living space in
458080	459120	order first.
459120	463040	Keeping yourself clean is infinitely easier than keeping the world clean, and often enough
463040	466960	the type of person that desires radical action to implement the latter can't even do the
466960	467960	former.
467960	470120	For example, the EU is on the verge of collapse.
470120	473880	Is it no surprise that the president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has an alcohol problem?
530120	545760	Or that European Parliament advocate for a federalized Europe, Guy Verhofstadt, tries
545760	550000	in vain to look 30 years younger than he is, while demanding that the EU member states
550000	570760	give the EU more sovereign power?
570760	574960	The fundamental problem is that the EU is dysfunctional, but it works just well enough
574960	577960	that the clowns in power think they understand it, when they don't.
577960	582080	And they believe that their limited understanding allows them to manipulate the system to induce
582080	586620	grand social change, when all it really creates is grand social disaster.
586620	590720	Of course, social systems require adjustment in order to properly function, and on some
590720	592720	level those social systems are required.
592720	596380	But in that adjustment, humility comes into play, because the EU has shown us that simply
596380	600040	marching in like you own the place more often than not leads to ruin.
600040	604840	In politics, humility manifests as a desire to improve things, yes, but also as an understanding
604840	609200	that being careful means sticking with what you know and starting out small, hence clean
609200	610200	your room.
610200	612880	Or in the case of Juncker and Verhofstadt, clean up your axe.
612880	616400	This is why there is an insistence to infantilize Britain due to the British desire to leave
616400	617400	the EU.
617400	621880	Europe views itself as the competent, wizened adult, even though it's really, really not.
621880	624500	So child is the only role that the UK can be cast in.
624500	628000	But unlike the prodigal son, the EU and the UK are not father and child.
628000	631600	No maturity on the part of the EU is necessary for the two partners to break up.
631600	634440	In fact, a breakup is probably a better metaphor, isn't it?
634440	635440	Think about it.
635440	636440	You've got two partners.
636440	637920	And yeah, the UK is the woman in the relationship.
637920	640720	The EU makes way more money, and the breakup is going to be tough on the UK.
640720	643640	She'll have to leave his house and live in a dumpy apartment for a while.
643640	644640	But she's no slouch either.
644640	645640	She can land on her feet.
645640	648040	And she's got many reasons to leave, too.
648040	649040	Abuse?
649040	650040	Gaslighting?
650040	652040	Treating her like a child and not a partner, perhaps?
652040	655560	If you ever needed more proof that the EU was a bad boyfriend after all, look at his
655560	658480	clingy desperate behavior after she told him that they were through.
658480	662800	Come on, don't tell me these clowns don't look like they were nice guys back in college.
662800	667120	A culture of safety has resulted in a class of British adults who, rather than deal with
667120	672460	their own affairs, appeal to an ever-greater authority, from parent, to boss, to state,
672460	673520	to super-state.
673520	677840	And the EU, with all of its flaws and cracks, has gladly taken up the mantle of ultimate
677840	679020	eternal authority.
679020	680780	It hardly deserves such a position.
680780	685260	For Brexit to be opposed, for the legitimate criticisms of the European project to be ignored,
685260	689660	the infantilization of Britain is necessary, both internally and externally, because the
689660	694180	only way for the EU to survive is to say to the British, quiet, the adults are talking.
