1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,300
The last time I spoke about Final Fantasy XVI on my channel, it was in the context of

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,400
a controversy surrounding Yoshi-P, the game's producer.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,020
He made a comment to the effect that Japanese developers no longer like using the term JRPG,

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,820
which caused a whole firestorm.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,140
But that video was about the game's pre-release controversy, and since then Final Fantasy

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,480
XVI has come out, been pretty well received by most people, and is considered to be a

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,020
contender for Game of the Year at the VGAs.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,300
Though personally, I don't think it's going to beat out either Baldur's Gate 3

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,980
or Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,620
In fact, I think Zelda's got it in the bag, but if you watch my video on that, you'd

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,340
probably already know that I'm pretty biased.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,780
Nonetheless, Final Fantasy XVI is a pretty good game.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,020
It's not an amazing game, this isn't a return to the days when Final Fantasy was

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,260
a system seller, but it's certainly better than Final Fantasy X or XII or XIII.

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,100
Here's my general review of the game.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,420
I won't spoil anything, so you have a chance to go and play it for yourself if you haven't

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,700
already, but the background footage I'm using is a random selection of the game's

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,340
side quests, so be warned.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,100
Final Fantasy XVI's story has been described as Game of Thrones-like by a lot of reviewers,

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,100
and with good reason.

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,980
It's got that same type of gritty realism that Game of Thrones thrived off of.

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,260
Lots of violence and sexuality, political drama between noble families, medieval warfare.

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,380
The first half of the game genuinely feels like dark fantasy.

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,660
The second half of the game, though, returns to more general Final Fantasy fare, you know,

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,820
dealing with magic crystals and killing God, leaving behind a lot of the Game of Thrones

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,340
elements in its storytelling.

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,660
In terms of combat, Final Fantasy XVI plays like a game from the Devil May Cry series,

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,360
which makes sense considering that the two games share staff.

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,820
The combat is entirely action-oriented, nothing turn-based whatsoever, and the game is full

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
of flashy, relatively easy-to-pull-off combos.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,500
The number of consecutive hits is displayed prominently on screen, incentivizing you to

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,540
keep the combos rolling, as well as various multipliers for dodges or counters or cinematic

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,540
events.

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Yes, cinematic.

35
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,620
Our good ol' friend the QuickTime event makes a return.

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,940
Climactic battles often see the player take control of large monsters, where their moves

37
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,400
are replaced with more extreme variations.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,660
These are considered by most players to be some of the coolest parts of the game, and

39
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,700
there's enough time between them that they don't overstay their welcome.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,380
Your character grows in power with level ups like in most RPGs, but the real advancement

41
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,200
comes in the form of a skill tree.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,940
Unlocking more combat abilities is primarily done through spending your skill points, and

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,700
more skill trees unlock at various points in the story.

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,580
This is all very normal action RPG stuff at this point, nothing revolutionary here.

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,780
The equipment system is pretty rudimentary, but it does the job well enough.

46
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,600
Buying and upgrading items is also very normal.

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,180
You find crafting materials out in the world, you upgrade your stuff.

48
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
It's all very by-the-books.

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,580
However, the equipment system was the source of the first post-launch controversy.

50
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,100
Final Fantasy XVI includes Game Journal mode in the form of overpowered equipment that

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,340
you have access to right from the start of the game.

52
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,460
These are called the Timely Accessories.

53
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,340
The Ring of Timely Strikes allows you to execute complex combos by simply tapping one button.

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,320
The Ring of Timely Evasion turns on auto-dodge.

55
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,640
The Ring of Timely Focus turns on slow motion right before you're about to get hit.

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,500
The Ring of Timely Healing turns on auto-heal, meaning you'll automatically use a potion

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
when you lose health.

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,380
The Ring of Timely Assistance will have your dog companion, Torgul, act in combat without

59
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,140
having to give him commands.

60
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,380
These items are pretty cheap on their own, but then some people out there tried to make

61
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,220
the argument that Final Fantasy XVI was shit, most of them repeatedly posting this clip

62
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,440
of some dumbass streaming the game, holding the controller with one hand and button-mashing

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,940
one button while eating.

64
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,100
This was apparently supposed to be proof that the game sucked, but it turned out he was

65
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,020
just using the Game Journal items.

66
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,500
The game has an unhideable UI element right above the HP meter, so you can always tell

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,280
if somebody's using these items.

68
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,380
The developers specifically said it was so that people couldn't hide their use of the

69
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,580
item online, which is pretty funny since so many people fell into that trap.

70
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,560
Speaking of the dog acting in combat without commands, you do get a few party members,

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,100
but they add almost nothing to the game.

72
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,820
Yeah, they're characters with personalities, and you do care about them, at least if you

73
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,700
care about the story, but in terms of what they actually bring to the fight, most of

74
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
the time they're just slowly auto-attacking in the background.

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,300
The dog is by far the most useful, and by that I mean not at all.

76
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,340
It's not like in Final Fantasy XV where the AI-controlled characters actually contribute

77
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,300
quite a bit, or like in the Final Fantasy VII Remake where you can actually switch focus

78
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,420
and play as them.

79
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,180
Nope, in this game your guys just sit around and lightly swing their weapons once every

80
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,400
five seconds or so.

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,340
You will be doing 99% of the damage in Final Fantasy XVI.

82
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,060
Nonetheless, it's still pretty cool to see them represented as little Final Fantasy

83
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,000
VI-style sprites in the save and load screens.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,380
Game design is where Final Fantasy XVI starts to get a little bit shaky.

85
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,040
The story's pretty good, but we've surpassed Metal Gear Solid's four cutscene length

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
at this point.

87
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,480
You'll be watching at least 20 minutes of dialogue and lore-heavy cutscenes after every

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
main story mission.

89
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,960
Some of them are actually quite gripping, which is what you want if you have to lose

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,800
control of the game that you're playing for what is the length of time of a block

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,080
of TV programming.

92
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,640
But others are just really, really boring, almost insufferable.

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,400
The writing's very hit or miss.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,980
It really feels like they crafted a very intricate lore for this world and threw the

95
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,240
vast majority of it into logs you have to read, or even worse, in the game's lore

96
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,920
menu, while there's many missed opportunities for environmental or contextual storytelling

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
with the settings and characters.

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,880
The side quests are almost all boring fetch quests.

99
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,760
In fact, even a good chunk of the main quests in between climactic fights are just fetch

100
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,800
quests too.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,400
The level design is not quite as bad as the legendarily awful Final Fantasy XIII's hallways,

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,720
but it is pretty close.

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,240
This world is not like the wide open area of Final Fantasy XV, full of cool things to

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,420
check out on the horizon.

105
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,780
Many of the levels are just hallways.

106
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,760
Monster encounters in the hallway, treasure chests in the hallway, cutscenes in the hallway.

107
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,500
When the hallway does open up slightly, it's a boss arena, before narrowing back down into

108
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,920
a hallway once again.

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,960
Side quests have you running up and down the hallways.

110
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,440
Sometimes the hallways criss-cross over each other, but there's never anything approaching

111
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,040
a maze or a dungeon.

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Occasionally, the game opens up into a large field you can explore, usually accompanied

113
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,860
by a handful of side quests from the latest town that take you to multiple areas of interest.

114
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,720
And these places are pretty fun for a little while, but functionally they are just wider

115
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
hallways.

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
There's one way in, and one way out.

117
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,280
The saving grace for the game's side content is the hunt board.

118
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,360
Particularly ferocious monsters have a bounty placed on their head, and if you bring them

119
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
in, you claim the reward.

120
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,920
They're the most engaging non-story fights in the game, and they're a lot of fun to

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
do.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,240
All in all, Final Fantasy XVI is a good game, but it doesn't break into excellent territory.

123
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,720
It's still worth playing, absolutely, but if you were thinking of picking up a PS5 just

124
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,840
for this game, no.

125
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
Wait until it comes out in a steam, maybe wait for a sale.

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,560
Like every new game coming out nowadays, though, somebody on the internet got mad at it for

127
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,880
some stupid reason.

128
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,840
To talk about that, though, I'm going to have to start spoiling parts of the game.

129
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,280
So if for some reason you were only here for my review of it, and you want to play it for

130
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,840
yourself, now's your chance to skedaddle.

131
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,960
Before Final Fantasy XVI launched, Yoshi P announced that there would be no black people

132
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
in the game.

133
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,900
His reasoning was that the game's setting was inspired by medieval Europe, and black

134
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,560
people simply didn't fit into his vision of the game's various kingdoms.

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,900
Having now finished the game, I'll confirm that yes, there are no black people in the

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,300
world of Valisthea.

137
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,480
The expansionist Empire of Sembrech, the isolationist Kingdom of Veloud, and the tiny Duchy of Rosaria

138
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,120
all appear to be vaguely based on various European feudal realms, while the Iron Kingdom

139
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
to the west is a pirate kingdom.

140
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,460
Each of these locations are home to a different ethnic group in the lore, but they all look

141
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
European.

142
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,820
The Dalmekian Republic to the south is the only nation with an elected parliament.

143
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,120
They appear to be vaguely Arab or Turkic, with notably different architecture, customs,

144
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,680
food, and environment than the rest of the game world.

145
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,960
It seems like the game designers wanted to make the continent feel like Europe with all

146
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,000
of its squabbling kingdoms, and just on the edge of European understanding was the Middle

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,720
East with its alien ideas.

148
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
And you know what?

149
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
They did a pretty good job at it.

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,980
Yeah, the Middle East wasn't, and still isn't, democratic, but you get the point.

151
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,760
This is a story that the west can intuitively pick up on from our own cultural background,

152
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,320
but it also doesn't really have room for random black people to simply exist as background

153
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,180
peasants like we're watching the rings of power or something.

154
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,780
These are ethnically homogenous societies, not mixed interracial ones.

155
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,800
But the usual progressive suspects got very, very angry at the state of affairs.

156
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,880
Their outrage mirrored the reaction to Kingdom Come Deliverance years ago, where that game

157
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,340
was set in a historically accurate kingdom of Bohemia in 1403, meaning no ethnic non-European

158
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,300
characters were featured in the game.

159
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,280
Final Fantasy XVI has no business abiding by historical realism.

160
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,840
Final Fantasy XVI has a medieval approach to diversity.

161
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,980
Final Fantasy XVI developer has a terrible answer as to why the game is so white.

162
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Yoshi P's answer is pretty obvious to anybody who's not ideologically motivated, but it's

163
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,780
an answer that game journals just can't accept.

164
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,920
Here's what he said about it in the interview.

165
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,780
This is a difficult question, but not one that was unexpected, seeing as diversity in

166
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,200
entertainment media has become a much-discussed topic as of late.

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,420
The answer I have, however, may end up being disappointing to some, depending on individual

168
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
expectations.

169
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,380
Rather than create something on a global scale, it was necessary to limit the scope

170
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,100
to a single landmass, one geographically and culturally isolated from the rest of the world,

171
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,780
in an age without airplanes, television, or phones.

172
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,180
Due to the underlying geographical, technological, and geopolitical constraints of this setting,

173
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,780
Valisthea was never going to realistically be as diverse as, say, modern-day Earth, or

174
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,260
even Final Fantasy XIV that has an entire planet and moon worth of nations, races, and

175
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,980
cultures at its disposal.

176
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,620
The isolated nature of this realm, however, does end up playing a large part in the story.

177
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,820
Ultimately, we felt that while incorporating ethnic diversity into Valisthea was important,

178
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,220
an over-incorporation into the single corner of a much larger world could end up causing

179
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,900
a violation of those narrative boundaries we originally set for ourselves.

180
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,980
The story we are telling is fantasy, yes, but it's also rooted in reality.

181
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,280
In the end, we simply want the focus to be less on the outward appearance of our characters

182
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,520
and more on who they are as people.

183
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,400
People who are complex and diverse in their natures, backgrounds, beliefs, personalities,

184
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,560
and motivations.

185
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
People whose stories we can resonate with.

186
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,020
There is diversity in Valisthea.

187
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,560
Diversity that, while not all-encompassing, is synergistic with the setting we've created

188
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,360
and is true to the inspirations from which we're drawing.

189
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
How do you think the Progs took this?

190
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,500
From the Verge, this idea of Final Fantasy XVI being rooted in reality is likely going

191
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,300
to end up hurting the developers' other, arguably more important goal for the game,

192
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,360
which is to reach as big of an audience as possible.

193
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,080
You know, based on those sales numbers, I don't think that ended up being a problem.

194
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Over at Kotaku, it made them go, yikes, in real life.

195
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
And you know what?

196
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,720
Maybe this is why y'all didn't get a review copy of the game.

197
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,880
Between this, and Nintendo, and Bethesda, and Ubisoft, all blacklisting Kotaku for publishing

198
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,220
leaked info?

199
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,040
Does Kotaku get any review copies of anything anymore?

200
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,040
So, the Progs were mad that there weren't black characters in the game.

201
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,280
It's not like Final Fantasy has a history of only having white characters.

202
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,360
Far from it, in fact.

203
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,600
But after the game came out, their ire rapidly shifted in a pretty ironic way.

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,840
Final Fantasy XVI suffers from its superficial handling of slavery.

205
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,400
We need to talk about slavery in Final Fantasy XVI.

206
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,640
Final Fantasy XVI fails its players and its world with its misguided treatment of slavery.

207
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah, the game's got a fair bit of slavery in it, as well as open prostitution, another

208
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,920
of its thematic ties to Game of Thrones.

209
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,600
Here's the explanation of how magic works in Final Fantasy XVI.

210
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,560
There are these giant mountains of crystal called the Mother Crystals.

211
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,120
Pieces of crystal are mined off of these mountains and can be used to cast simple magic.

212
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,320
Everything in Valisthea operates off of crystals.

213
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,400
Street lamps, forges, water wells, crystals do it all.

214
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Bearers are people who are randomly born with the ability to cast magic without the use

215
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
of a crystal.

216
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,480
However, doing so causes their body to slowly turn to stone.

217
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,600
Bearers are treated differently in each society.

218
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,600
In the Iron Kingdom, bearers are killed immediately as they're an affront to their religion.

219
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,280
In Rosaria, bearers are culturally looked down upon, but treated as valued servants.

220
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,960
Not equal, and certainly sometimes mistreated, but also generally not treated cruelly by

221
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
their masters.

222
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,880
In Sanbreque, bearers are chattel, used for labor until the curse renders them unable

223
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,920
to cast magic, and then discarded.

224
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,440
In overseas nations outside of the continent of Valisthea, bearers who are sold there are

225
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,600
treated extremely well, as those locations don't have Mother Crystals, and therefore

226
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,960
they have no other way to access magic.

227
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,920
The exception to this rule are the Dominants, family lineages who can not only use magic,

228
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,360
but transform into giant monsters known as Icons.

229
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
They can nonetheless still fall victim to the curse of stone.

230
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,480
The Dominants aren't relevant to the slavery conversation, though.

231
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,400
In Final Fantasy XVI's world, the bearers occupy some kind of slave class or other type

232
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,120
of underclass status in the various realms of Valisthea.

233
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,620
They're not the only source of magic, so they can't just take over with their power.

234
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,200
Regular humans can still use crystals.

235
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,520
But having somebody who can cast magic without a crystal is pretty convenient.

236
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,840
They're also rare and born at random.

237
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,520
The state tracks every pregnancy and tests every child to see if they're bearers.

238
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,400
It works a lot like the Jedi Order, in fact.

239
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,000
If a child is discovered to be a bearer, they're taken by the state and placed into a life

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
of slavery.

241
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,040
Most parents are actually happy to have their child taken like this, as culturally being

242
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,840
the parent of a bearer is considered embarrassing.

243
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,600
For the majority of the game, you play as a revolutionary who not only wants to overthrow

244
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,580
the various monarchies on the continent in the name of equality, but also destroy the

245
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,880
Mother Crystals and abolish magic in order to free the bearers.

246
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,600
The progressive complaints about Final Fantasy XVI revolve around the idea that this storyline,

247
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,360
where the bearers are a slave class, is not treated with the undue care and respect that

248
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,900
they believe it deserves.

249
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,600
Instead of wasting time with large block quotes from the articles, let me just summarize to

250
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
you their arguments.

251
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
1.

252
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,520
The protagonist of the game, Clive Rossfield, is a member of the royal family of Rosaria.

253
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,360
He's not a bearer in the traditional sense.

254
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,080
He was given fire magic due to the blessing of his younger brother, Joshua, the Dominant

255
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
of Fire.

256
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,300
At least, that's what everyone initially thinks.

257
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,840
It's actually a late-game plot twist.

258
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,220
They do something else entirely.

259
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,380
But dominance can give non-magicked humans access to bearer-like magic, so it's a reasonable

260
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,380
assumption.

261
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,140
After Clive's mother betrays her country to send Breck and orchestrates an attack on her

262
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,340
own family, I told you we'd be spoiling stuff at this point, Clive is presumed dead.

263
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,940
His identity is legally erased, and he's sold into slavery as any other bearer.

264
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,540
Despite this, the game doesn't really show the impact of slavery on Clive, even after

265
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,000
he's been freed and meets up with Cid, the leader of the revolutionaries, fighting to

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
end slavery.

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,720
I don't agree with this criticism.

268
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,400
Clive is noble and energetic when we see him as a teenager, and he's sullen and defeatist

269
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
as an adult.

270
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,600
And this is likely due not only to the loss of his family and country, but also to his

271
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,140
current lot in life.

272
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,900
We don't need to be shown the 13 years of Clive's torture, we can see it in his personality.

273
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,960
When he first encounters Cid's little terrorist cell, Clive's attitude is one of, this is

274
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,000
just the way the world is and we can't change it.

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,160
And over the course of the game, he comes around to the idea that Cid's quest to end

276
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,640
slavery in Valisthea is a moral one.

277
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,360
When Cid dies at the game's midpoint, Clive takes on his name and continues his operation,

278
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,880
and while him parroting Cid's viewpoint exactly down to the word is a bit on the nose,

279
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,680
we understand that he's come around.

280
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,600
Clive has the life experience of both highborn and low at this point, and unlike these articles,

281
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,840
I don't think he's driven solely to honor Cid's memory.

282
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,880
That's part of it, but I also think that Clive's been genuinely convinced of Cid's

283
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
position.

284
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,680
Of course, Clive's interest in abolishing the slavery he sees and personally experienced

285
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,400
does take a hard backseat to the whole killing god thing as the game ramps up.

286
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,720
But hey, when the villain aiming at you is god, maybe emancipation has to wait a little

287
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
longer.

288
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,000
Two, the game journals view the game's solution to slavery as assimilationist.

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,440
It's Cid's plan to destroy the Mother Crystals and abolish magic, which Clive continues after

290
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
his death.

291
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
Cid's assumption is that if magic were abolished, then the bearers would have no reason to continue

292
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,960
being enslaved.

293
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
This is stupid.

294
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,000
There's no reason the nobles wouldn't just keep the slaves they've already got, since

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,240
they're already enslaved, and put them to physical work instead, like slavery in the

296
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
real world.

297
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,720
Additionally, it places the burden of change on the enslaved.

298
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,260
It says if you didn't have this quality, you wouldn't be a slave.

299
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,720
The solution is to therefore remove the quality and make you like everyone else.

300
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,720
The people who own slaves are certainly depicted by the game as morally reprehensible, but

301
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,720
the solution the game's plot offers is less behead the slaver and more change the slave.

302
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,320
Unlike the first criticism, this one actually has some weight, and I personally agree with

303
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
it.

304
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,640
But it's a very non-leftist type of analysis, isn't it?

305
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,720
This isn't the argument of a political realist, of somebody who's employing some type of historical

306
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,660
materialist analysis to the world of Final Fantasy XVI.

307
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,160
A leftist view of the game's setting would reveal the economic forces at play.

308
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Magic is valuable.

309
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,240
It's a method of generating more value with less labor, like using higher quality tools

310
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,840
or machines in the real world.

311
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,400
But since the bearers cast magic without the use of tools, they themselves are the means

312
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
of production.

313
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,160
Looking at Final Fantasy XVI through a Marxist lens, the option of abolish magic suddenly

314
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,120
makes a lot more sense, as doing so changes the relationship of the people with the means

315
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
of production.

316
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,240
The purely moral argument of, it doesn't matter what the status of magic is or how valuable

317
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,560
bearers are, slavery is evil, while certainly true, is a position you can't arrive at solely

318
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,320
through a materialist analysis.

319
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,000
Rather, moral intuitions are its source, which means Jonathan Haidt, which means evolutionary

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,360
psychology, and most leftists decry evolutionary psychology as biologically essentialist, therefore

321
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
eugenicist, therefore fascist and evil.

322
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,840
I don't think progressive games journalists are educated enough to follow the chain of

323
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,720
logic here, but I'm sure you get it.

324
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,880
TLDR, the second criticism is correct, but it's strange to see leftoids use it because

325
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,320
they reject all of its logical foundations.

326
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
3.

327
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,060
The vast majority of the game that focuses on the Plate of the Bearers is side content,

328
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,520
and you can go the whole game without even seeing it.

329
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
This is, again, true.

330
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,960
I remember one side quest, where a minor noble family was buying bears and having them get

331
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,600
ripped apart by dogs for fun.

332
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,880
They buy Clive, and being the main character badass he is, you kill the dogs.

333
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,240
Angered by this, they resolve to buy even more vicious dogs and show you what's what,

334
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,560
only to have the dogs immediately turn on them and rip them apart.

335
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,680
It is exactly as ham-fisted as it sounds.

336
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,840
Another side quest in the same area has a noble child hire you to find her pet Chloe.

337
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,400
You discover that Chloe wasn't a dog or something, but a bear who had turned to stone due to

338
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
using too much magic.

339
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,560
The child had owned several bears, naming them all Chloe, but had rode each of them

340
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
too hard.

341
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,480
She doesn't even seem to recognize that Chloe was a person, and she considers the

342
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,300
whole affair an annoyance now that she has to buy a new one.

343
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,240
The progressive complaint is because all of this stuff is side content, players don't

344
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,520
actually have to face the reality of bears in this world.

345
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,060
They can simply skip the quests, which is the video game equivalent of turning a blind

346
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,560
eye to injustice.

347
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,860
This is a dumb critique.

348
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,940
I still don't like this stuff personally, but for a different reason.

349
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,700
Guests like these serve to outline just how bad bears have it in this world, but they

350
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,140
are comedically, simplistically evil.

351
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,500
The people who abuse bears are Saturday morning cartoon villains.

352
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,260
In the real world, attitudes towards slavery weren't so cut and dry.

353
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,780
There absolutely were some real shitheels who just did not give a fuck and worked them

354
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,040
to death and raped them and all the rest of it.

355
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,540
There were also people who believed that they were doing a good thing by owning slaves.

356
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,620
A common belief in the American South was that black people simply were not capable

357
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,040
of self-governance and needed to be ruled the same way that parents rule their children.

358
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,760
For some of them, this was simply a post hoc justification of their exploitation, but others

359
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,940
genuinely believed it.

360
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,260
That doesn't make what they did morally acceptable, obviously, I'm not saying that,

361
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,400
but the person who is factually extremely wrong about the nature of his fellow man is

362
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,860
not the same kind of person who is sadistically evil and aware of himself.

363
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,040
Further still are the people who owned slaves while wanting slavery abolished, like many

364
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,680
of America's founding fathers.

365
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,840
They believed that while slavery was evil, as long as it was legal, they couldn't afford

366
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,500
to not employ slaves in their businesses.

367
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,480
If they took a moral stance and refused to use slave labor, they would find themselves

368
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,200
at a consistent disadvantage against their less moral competitors.

369
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,020
Their belief was that until the system itself was changed, they had no choice but to own

370
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,640
slaves, as individual action in a vacuum would simply mean their own destruction.

371
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,540
Again, this doesn't make it right, far from it, and maybe some of these people actually

372
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,500
were also sadistic fucks who use this as a cover story, who knows, but surely at least

373
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,700
some of them weren't.

374
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,140
The point I'm making is that the lack of nuance in Final Fantasy XVI's slavery story

375
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,660
makes it ridiculous.

376
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,700
Every slave is the purest saint, every slave owner is the absolute worst person with no

377
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,300
redeeming qualities or really, no characterization at all beyond just loving to pig fuck their

378
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
slaves.

379
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,200
But that isn't the game journal's critique.

380
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,680
Their view is that the story isn't black and white enough, and also that you can just

381
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
skip over it.

382
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,440
Speaking of black and white, they've completely forgotten about the whole no black people

383
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,480
complaint from back before the game came out.

384
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,400
Man, can you imagine how that would have unfolded?

385
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,220
Imagine an inclusively added black noble family, treating a white enslaved bearer like shit.

386
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,640
It would make sense in terms of Valisthea's class dynamics, but I can already imagine

387
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,800
their headlines.

388
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,140
Final Fantasy XVI's racially insensitive scene ignores the real-world racism.

389
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,640
These people really do just exist to hate on things that fall outside of the bounds

390
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
of their politics.

391
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,080
Not even explicitly against their politics, just not explicitly for it.

392
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,000
I wonder if that's why IGN recently published an article implying that Final Fantasy XVI

393
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,920
caused Square Enix to take a massive financial hit, when in reality it was Square's other

394
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,040
bombs like the Avengers game in Forespoken that lost them money, with Final Fantasy XVI's

395
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,760
success being the only one of their properties keeping them afloat right now.

396
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,880
I'll give you one final devian leap of logic before we wrap this up.

397
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,600
All of these articles complaining about the Final Fantasy XVI treatment of slavery as

398
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,420
a topic, they all hand-wave the whole killing god part of the story.

399
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,780
To them it's an afterthought, like oh, the plight of the bearers takes second fiddle

400
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,040
to the usual Final Fantasy schlock.

401
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
And fair enough.

402
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,640
But I'll tell you why I think all of these articles fail to go into that half of the

403
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,120
story in detail.

404
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,080
In their view, the whole Sid and Clive end slavery and overthrow the monarchy, that's

405
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,160
a fundamentally leftist storyline.

406
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,040
Reject the hereditary nobility, power to the people, French Revolution style, and Sid's

407
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,680
ragtag crew contains a whole bunch of different types of people.

408
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Different ethnicities, nobles and commoners alike, all working hard to accomplish that

409
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
goal.

410
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,240
Clive goes on and on about freedom and liberation and being down with the cause.

411
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,580
It's the ideal lefty power fantasy.

412
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,040
But when the plot shifts towards the killing god stuff in the second half, the ethic of

413
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,200
the story also dramatically shifts.

414
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,100
The use of magic causes blight on the land.

415
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,140
Every force is sucked up from the land to cast spells, slowly killing everything.

416
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,240
Yes, Final Fantasy as a series has a few core themes.

417
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,580
And the idea of magic as a stand-in for fossil fuels and a pending ecological disaster resulting

418
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,940
from its use by humans failing to maintain a balance with nature?

419
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,740
That is a consistent one across most of the games in the series.

420
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,300
The god in the game that we're fighting against is actually an alien being named Ultima who

421
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,100
traveled to the planet the game takes place on, having destroyed his own world through

422
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,840
overusing magic.

423
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,360
After realizing that the blight was appearing on this new world too, Ultima devised a plan.

424
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,600
He created the Mother Crystals, he created humanity, and then he entombed parts of himself

425
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
inside the Mother Crystals.

426
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,720
As humanity discovered magic, the blight would spread, but the spent magical energy would

427
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,520
channel through the core of the Mother Crystals, Ultima's entombed parts.

428
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,200
Eventually, humanity would produce an ideal vessel through which unlimited magic could

429
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,080
be channeled, which Ultima could then possess seeing as he's a disembodied spirit.

430
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,760
Naturally, this person is Clive.

431
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,860
The story's not exactly clear on this next bit, but it's heavily implied that the capacity

432
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,080
for consciousness is a key component of the spread of the blight.

433
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,720
Humans, with will, casting magic, causes the land's aether to be consumed and lost, spreading

434
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
blight.

435
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,080
But an overabundance of aether in one location, a problem in the other direction, causes all

436
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,060
the life forms in the affected area to lose their will, becoming what the game calls Akashic.

437
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,640
In terms of game mechanics, this just means that there's stronger variants of regular

438
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
enemies.

439
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,960
But in terms of the story, Akashic creatures are philosophical zombies.

440
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,600
A philosophical zombie is a thought experiment, where a person behaves like any other person

441
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
but has no conscious experience.

442
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,360
For example, if I were to poke you with a sharp stick, you would presumably feel pain

443
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,520
and then react accordingly.

444
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,440
But if I were to poke a philosophical zombie, while it might react exactly like you did,

445
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,120
it would feel no pain, as it doesn't have the capacity for it.

446
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,960
You could talk to a philosophical zombie and it would talk back to you like a real human,

447
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,160
but there's no consciousness behind the eyes there.

448
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,620
It's simply an acting and reacting automaton.

449
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,780
In colloquial speech, the difference between a person and a philosophical zombie is that

450
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,460
a person has a soul, while a philosophical zombie doesn't, it's simply acting like

451
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
it does.

452
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,460
It's going through extremely complicated, identical to humans, but ultimately pre-programmed

453
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
responses.

454
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,780
The point of the thought experiment is that it's one of the common results of having

455
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,220
ultimate skepticism.

456
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,820
You can't know if other people are having a conscious experience like yours, because

457
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,080
you can't access it.

458
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,900
While you do know that your own consciousness exists because you are literally it, you don't

459
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,580
know with perfect accuracy if anybody else's does.

460
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,460
You might be the only real person and everybody else is just a philosophical zombie, a meat

461
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
puppet.

462
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,220
Now you know what, that's not true, because obviously I'm the main character, you guys

463
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
cease to exist the minute we stop talking.

464
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,900
This is what's being expressed by that kinda creepy Divine Light is Severed meme from Cruelty

465
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,660
Squad, where the caption says, Divine Light Severed, you are a flesh automaton animated

466
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,660
by neurotransmitters.

467
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,560
I don't know much about Cruelty Squad, but from what I can gather, this caption appears

468
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,660
when you die and you're brought back to life.

469
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,720
A new body is made and given your memories in the story.

470
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,380
And since you're aware of this process, you know that you're not really you, you're

471
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,640
just a facsimile meant to be indistinguishable from the previous you.

472
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,380
This meme gained a lot of traction because of its real-world implications in the postmodern

473
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,380
age.

474
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,980
Before the Enlightenment, humans understood themselves as divine beings connected to God,

475
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,620
and therefore they had a telos, making their actions a necessary part of putting the cosmos

476
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
in order.

477
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,180
But in the age of modern science, we've opened the hood on a lot of what makes us

478
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,180
sick.

479
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,580
And while we don't have ultimate understanding of everything yet, we do know that there probably

480
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,900
isn't a soul, that consciousness is an emergent property of our brains and their firing neurotransmitters.

481
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,460
Oh, real quick I guess.

482
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,160
An emergent property is a thing that doesn't exist in isolation, but does exist as a result

483
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,720
of the interaction between other systems that do exist.

484
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,820
For example, in economics, the market doesn't exist, but it's a property that emerges

485
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,400
when individual consumers make choices in a decentralized way.

486
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,760
As a result of people buying and selling products at their own preferred rates of exchange,

487
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,860
a market emerges, with efficient pricing based on supply and demand.

488
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,580
If the people stop trading, the market vanishes, but the market exists as long as the people

489
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,100
keep interacting with each other.

490
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,560
The formation of snowflakes, the shape of flying flocks of birds, the behavior of traffic

491
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,100
jams, these are all emergent properties.

492
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,020
The pattern doesn't exist on its own, but it comes into existence when individuals do

493
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,740
what they would normally do.

494
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,840
Human consciousness is, as far as we can tell, an emergent property.

495
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,300
There's no soul there.

496
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,900
It seems like consciousness exists as a result of the various brain systems operating together

497
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,140
in the way that they do.

498
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,240
In fact, an extremely pessimistic view of this discovery is that we're all actually

499
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,680
philosophical zombies.

500
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,240
Yes, even you, even if you think you know your own consciousness.

501
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,260
We're all just flesh automatons animated by neurotransmitters with no real consciousness,

502
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,100
no divine light, and that what we think our consciousness is, is actually just a perception

503
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,900
trick that our brains pull on us, and that what lies beneath the extremely thin surface

504
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,260
is actually just a bunch of biologically pre-programmed and environmentally learned

505
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,860
responses to stimuli.

506
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,340
Well, ignoring that dark turn, going back to Final Fantasy XVI, Akashic creatures are

507
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,220
lore-wise actually philosophical zombies.

508
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,500
They're empty husks, simply reacting as their biology leads them around, with no semblance

509
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,320
of understanding or consciousness.

510
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,980
When animals become Akashic, they tend to live in unison and harmony with other Akashic

511
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,100
creatures, even if one was a predator of the other normally.

512
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,260
When humans become Akashic, they just stand around in one place waiting for stimuli.

513
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,820
But all of them attack non-Akashic life on sight.

514
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,000
Ultima can control Akashic creatures with his mind, making them march in unison or attack

515
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
with strategy.

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,220
And when Akashic creatures use magic, the land's aether is not wasted, but collected.

517
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,640
If humans, with will, casting magic, cause that magic to be expended and expand the blight,

518
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,400
humans without will casting magic conserves the land's magic, causing it to concentrate.

519
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,680
So Ultima's plan is to accelerate the spread of blight to weaken the planet's life, and

520
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,080
then turn them Akashic with concentrated magic, allowing them to be empty vessels for his

521
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
purposes.

522
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,420
And Clive's body as the ultimate empty vessel he'll possess, allowing himself to cast

523
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,280
magic without causing blight.

524
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,840
The end result of Ultima's plan is what he considers a utopian society.

525
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,200
All life forms stripped of their free will, existing in an equality of emptiness, and

526
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,920
as such they'll no longer be capable of destroying the planet.

527
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,120
Ultima himself lives on in Clive's body, using it to cast magic as he wishes without

528
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,840
causing blight, since the body itself is technically also will-less.

529
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,160
Don't worry, I haven't gotten lost in the weeds.

530
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,880
I do actually remember that I'm supposed to be explaining why leftoids find this part

531
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,760
of the story distasteful, as opposed to the whole overthrow the monarchy and liberate

532
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,120
the slaves portion.

533
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,040
The king of Walood, the dominant of Odin, Barnabas Tharmir, is Ultima's right-hand man.

534
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,960
He has willingly sold his soul, or his neurotransmitters, to Ultima, as he actually views Ultima as

535
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,760
a god, and agrees that his vision of a world devoid of consciousness is the only way to

536
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
stop the blight.

537
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,340
Also, I guess having Ultima conjure up the naked form of his mother that he apparently

538
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,600
has the hots for was a big reason for Barnabas getting onside.

539
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,200
The point is, a lot of Ultima's philosophy is repeated through Barnabas as his earthly

540
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
mouthpiece.

541
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,520
They both believe that all of the evils and woes of humanity stem from free will, and

542
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,040
that salvation is found in the equality of abolishing all consciousness.

543
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,520
Clive takes up the individualist position in that debate, declaring that as his own

544
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,560
person, he is inherently valuable.

545
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,880
Even if Clive isn't perfectly equal to everyone else, that doesn't matter.

546
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,400
His friends and his family are also individuals, they're different from him, and while that

547
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,440
makes them not equals, since some are better in some ways and some are worse, that inequality

548
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,560
doesn't actually matter.

549
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,640
What matters is their relationships.

550
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,300
Final Fantasy XVI presents the utopian equality of Ultima as being equivalent to the real

551
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,940
world of the atomized individual, where everyone is isolated, everyone is interchangeable,

552
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,400
and everyone is the same.

553
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,580
While Clive's connections to Jill and Joshua and everyone else are rooted in individualism,

554
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,680
they're not all the same, and that's why they can have relationships with each other.

555
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,820
Because they're not equal, they have complementary attributes that give those connections meaning.

556
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,540
Even though Clive is a rebel against the crown and the breaker of chains, that doesn't

557
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,700
make Clive a leftist revolutionary hero, nor does it make Final Fantasy XVI a leftist game.

558
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,420
In fact, it's quite the opposite.

559
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,220
The ethics that drive Clive are equal parts liberal individualism and conservative traditional

560
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
family bonds.

561
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,480
To contrast, the ethics that drive Ultima are notions of equality, which necessitates

562
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,860
interchangeability and disposability, and notions of utopia, which necessitates a complete

563
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,740
wiping clean of all old orders and institutions, which is exactly what Ultima spends the whole

564
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,220
game pursuing through his manipulation behind the scenes, goading all the various powers

565
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,740
of Valisthea into destructive wars meant to abolish them all and create a blank slate.

566
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,740
Again, as I've said many times in this video and on this channel in general, I don't

567
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,660
think these people are educated enough to know what I'm talking about, but their intuition

568
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,100
tells them to look at the Ultima storyline and say, no, this bad.

569
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,300
They don't know why, not really, but I do.

570
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,820
If you are the type of person to hold equality and revolution as first-order moral values,

571
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,060
then a story where equality is depicted as lowest common denominator conformity and revolution

572
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,420
as destructive to every good thing humans want, that would be a story that you intuitively

573
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,500
find uncomfortable, even if you don't understand why.

574
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,080
And Clive's focus on individualism and tradition, when revolutionary leftism is anti both of

575
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,900
those things, is probably just as disquieting.

576
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,140
Anyway, the game journals and the progs don't really think of the game in this way.

577
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,800
They're not actively thinking this.

578
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,540
Their intuition just takes them there.

579
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,820
In the same vein, I don't think the game designers had this in mind either.

580
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,820
Like, I don't think that Yoshi P intended to write some anti-communist moral tale using

581
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
Ultima here.

582
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,780
It came out that way for the same reason.

583
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Human intuition.

584
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,780
It's kind of like how socialists online claim that the Federation in Star Trek is a socialist

585
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,660
utopia because they don't use money.

586
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,920
Even though private property still clearly exists, and Roddenberry was a liberal end-of-history

587
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,580
type utopian who made one of the most enduring pop culture communist critiques in the form

588
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,620
of the Borg, where everyone's equal in the Borg collective.

589
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,740
It's one of those things where reading political theory allows you to word what is going on,

590
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,980
but it's not really necessary because you intuitively get it when you see it.

591
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,180
The world of equality is one where everyone and everything are the same, and forced to

592
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,680
be so because of our innate differences.

593
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,580
The world of diversity is one where differences exist, even if those differences generate

594
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,300
inequality, because the differences are what make relations between individuals worthwhile.

595
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,820
In other words, it's socialism versus liberalism, and that's why leftoids are complaining about

596
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,500
Final Fantasy XVI's story, even if they don't know why they're doing it.

597
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,740
Anyway, that's all I've got to say about this.

598
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Thanks for being here, guys.

599
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,020
Despite its flaws, Final Fantasy XVI is still a good game, so if you like, pick it up.

600
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,460
Oh, actually, I forgot, the game really is 10 out of 10.

601
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
It's got Hodor.

602
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
That's right.

603
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
All is forgiven.

604
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,480
Game of the year, baby.
