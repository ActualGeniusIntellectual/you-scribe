00:00.000 --> 00:16.300
The last time I spoke about Final Fantasy XVI on my channel, it was in the context of

00:16.300 --> 00:19.400
a controversy surrounding Yoshi-P, the game's producer.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.020
He made a comment to the effect that Japanese developers no longer like using the term JRPG,

00:24.020 --> 00:25.820
which caused a whole firestorm.

00:25.820 --> 00:30.140
But that video was about the game's pre-release controversy, and since then Final Fantasy

00:30.140 --> 00:33.480
XVI has come out, been pretty well received by most people, and is considered to be a

00:33.480 --> 00:36.020
contender for Game of the Year at the VGAs.

00:36.020 --> 00:39.300
Though personally, I don't think it's going to beat out either Baldur's Gate 3

00:39.300 --> 00:40.980
or Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

00:40.980 --> 00:44.620
In fact, I think Zelda's got it in the bag, but if you watch my video on that, you'd

00:44.620 --> 00:46.340
probably already know that I'm pretty biased.

00:46.340 --> 00:48.780
Nonetheless, Final Fantasy XVI is a pretty good game.

00:48.780 --> 00:52.020
It's not an amazing game, this isn't a return to the days when Final Fantasy was

00:52.020 --> 00:56.260
a system seller, but it's certainly better than Final Fantasy X or XII or XIII.

00:56.260 --> 00:58.100
Here's my general review of the game.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.420
I won't spoil anything, so you have a chance to go and play it for yourself if you haven't

01:01.420 --> 01:04.700
already, but the background footage I'm using is a random selection of the game's

01:04.700 --> 01:06.340
side quests, so be warned.

01:06.340 --> 01:11.100
Final Fantasy XVI's story has been described as Game of Thrones-like by a lot of reviewers,

01:11.100 --> 01:12.100
and with good reason.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.980
It's got that same type of gritty realism that Game of Thrones thrived off of.

01:15.980 --> 01:20.260
Lots of violence and sexuality, political drama between noble families, medieval warfare.

01:20.260 --> 01:23.380
The first half of the game genuinely feels like dark fantasy.

01:23.380 --> 01:27.660
The second half of the game, though, returns to more general Final Fantasy fare, you know,

01:27.660 --> 01:31.820
dealing with magic crystals and killing God, leaving behind a lot of the Game of Thrones

01:31.820 --> 01:33.340
elements in its storytelling.

01:33.340 --> 01:37.660
In terms of combat, Final Fantasy XVI plays like a game from the Devil May Cry series,

01:37.660 --> 01:40.360
which makes sense considering that the two games share staff.

01:40.360 --> 01:44.820
The combat is entirely action-oriented, nothing turn-based whatsoever, and the game is full

01:44.820 --> 01:47.820
of flashy, relatively easy-to-pull-off combos.

01:47.820 --> 01:51.500
The number of consecutive hits is displayed prominently on screen, incentivizing you to

01:51.500 --> 01:56.540
keep the combos rolling, as well as various multipliers for dodges or counters or cinematic

01:56.540 --> 01:57.540
events.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.540
Yes, cinematic.

01:58.540 --> 02:00.620
Our good ol' friend the QuickTime event makes a return.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.940
Climactic battles often see the player take control of large monsters, where their moves

02:04.940 --> 02:07.400
are replaced with more extreme variations.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.660
These are considered by most players to be some of the coolest parts of the game, and

02:10.660 --> 02:13.700
there's enough time between them that they don't overstay their welcome.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.380
Your character grows in power with level ups like in most RPGs, but the real advancement

02:17.420 --> 02:19.200
comes in the form of a skill tree.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.940
Unlocking more combat abilities is primarily done through spending your skill points, and

02:22.940 --> 02:25.700
more skill trees unlock at various points in the story.

02:25.700 --> 02:29.580
This is all very normal action RPG stuff at this point, nothing revolutionary here.

02:29.580 --> 02:32.780
The equipment system is pretty rudimentary, but it does the job well enough.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.600
Buying and upgrading items is also very normal.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.180
You find crafting materials out in the world, you upgrade your stuff.

02:38.180 --> 02:39.180
It's all very by-the-books.

02:39.180 --> 02:44.580
However, the equipment system was the source of the first post-launch controversy.

02:44.580 --> 02:49.100
Final Fantasy XVI includes Game Journal mode in the form of overpowered equipment that

02:49.100 --> 02:51.340
you have access to right from the start of the game.

02:51.340 --> 02:53.460
These are called the Timely Accessories.

02:53.460 --> 02:58.340
The Ring of Timely Strikes allows you to execute complex combos by simply tapping one button.

02:58.340 --> 03:01.320
The Ring of Timely Evasion turns on auto-dodge.

03:01.320 --> 03:05.640
The Ring of Timely Focus turns on slow motion right before you're about to get hit.

03:05.640 --> 03:09.500
The Ring of Timely Healing turns on auto-heal, meaning you'll automatically use a potion

03:09.500 --> 03:10.500
when you lose health.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.380
The Ring of Timely Assistance will have your dog companion, Torgul, act in combat without

03:15.380 --> 03:17.140
having to give him commands.

03:17.140 --> 03:20.380
These items are pretty cheap on their own, but then some people out there tried to make

03:20.380 --> 03:25.220
the argument that Final Fantasy XVI was shit, most of them repeatedly posting this clip

03:25.220 --> 03:29.440
of some dumbass streaming the game, holding the controller with one hand and button-mashing

03:29.440 --> 03:30.940
one button while eating.

03:30.940 --> 03:34.100
This was apparently supposed to be proof that the game sucked, but it turned out he was

03:34.100 --> 03:36.020
just using the Game Journal items.

03:36.060 --> 03:40.500
The game has an unhideable UI element right above the HP meter, so you can always tell

03:40.500 --> 03:42.280
if somebody's using these items.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.380
The developers specifically said it was so that people couldn't hide their use of the

03:45.380 --> 03:49.580
item online, which is pretty funny since so many people fell into that trap.

03:49.580 --> 03:53.560
Speaking of the dog acting in combat without commands, you do get a few party members,

03:53.560 --> 03:55.100
but they add almost nothing to the game.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.820
Yeah, they're characters with personalities, and you do care about them, at least if you

03:58.820 --> 04:01.700
care about the story, but in terms of what they actually bring to the fight, most of

04:01.700 --> 04:04.700
the time they're just slowly auto-attacking in the background.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.300
The dog is by far the most useful, and by that I mean not at all.

04:08.300 --> 04:12.340
It's not like in Final Fantasy XV where the AI-controlled characters actually contribute

04:12.340 --> 04:16.300
quite a bit, or like in the Final Fantasy VII Remake where you can actually switch focus

04:16.300 --> 04:17.420
and play as them.

04:17.420 --> 04:21.180
Nope, in this game your guys just sit around and lightly swing their weapons once every

04:21.180 --> 04:22.400
five seconds or so.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.340
You will be doing 99% of the damage in Final Fantasy XVI.

04:25.340 --> 04:29.060
Nonetheless, it's still pretty cool to see them represented as little Final Fantasy

04:29.060 --> 04:32.000
VI-style sprites in the save and load screens.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.380
Game design is where Final Fantasy XVI starts to get a little bit shaky.

04:35.380 --> 04:39.040
The story's pretty good, but we've surpassed Metal Gear Solid's four cutscene length

04:39.040 --> 04:40.040
at this point.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.480
You'll be watching at least 20 minutes of dialogue and lore-heavy cutscenes after every

04:44.480 --> 04:45.920
main story mission.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.960
Some of them are actually quite gripping, which is what you want if you have to lose

04:48.960 --> 04:51.800
control of the game that you're playing for what is the length of time of a block

04:51.800 --> 04:53.080
of TV programming.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.640
But others are just really, really boring, almost insufferable.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.400
The writing's very hit or miss.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.980
It really feels like they crafted a very intricate lore for this world and threw the

05:01.980 --> 05:06.240
vast majority of it into logs you have to read, or even worse, in the game's lore

05:06.240 --> 05:10.920
menu, while there's many missed opportunities for environmental or contextual storytelling

05:10.920 --> 05:12.480
with the settings and characters.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.880
The side quests are almost all boring fetch quests.

05:14.880 --> 05:19.760
In fact, even a good chunk of the main quests in between climactic fights are just fetch

05:19.760 --> 05:20.800
quests too.

05:20.800 --> 05:26.400
The level design is not quite as bad as the legendarily awful Final Fantasy XIII's hallways,

05:26.400 --> 05:27.720
but it is pretty close.

05:27.720 --> 05:32.240
This world is not like the wide open area of Final Fantasy XV, full of cool things to

05:32.240 --> 05:33.420
check out on the horizon.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.780
Many of the levels are just hallways.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.760
Monster encounters in the hallway, treasure chests in the hallway, cutscenes in the hallway.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.500
When the hallway does open up slightly, it's a boss arena, before narrowing back down into

05:43.500 --> 05:44.920
a hallway once again.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.960
Side quests have you running up and down the hallways.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.440
Sometimes the hallways criss-cross over each other, but there's never anything approaching

05:50.440 --> 05:52.040
a maze or a dungeon.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.880
Occasionally, the game opens up into a large field you can explore, usually accompanied

05:55.880 --> 05:59.860
by a handful of side quests from the latest town that take you to multiple areas of interest.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.720
And these places are pretty fun for a little while, but functionally they are just wider

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
hallways.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.520
There's one way in, and one way out.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.280
The saving grace for the game's side content is the hunt board.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.360
Particularly ferocious monsters have a bounty placed on their head, and if you bring them

06:13.360 --> 06:14.360
in, you claim the reward.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.920
They're the most engaging non-story fights in the game, and they're a lot of fun to

06:17.920 --> 06:18.920
do.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.240
All in all, Final Fantasy XVI is a good game, but it doesn't break into excellent territory.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.720
It's still worth playing, absolutely, but if you were thinking of picking up a PS5 just

06:26.720 --> 06:27.840
for this game, no.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.080
Wait until it comes out in a steam, maybe wait for a sale.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.560
Like every new game coming out nowadays, though, somebody on the internet got mad at it for

06:34.560 --> 06:35.880
some stupid reason.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.840
To talk about that, though, I'm going to have to start spoiling parts of the game.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.280
So if for some reason you were only here for my review of it, and you want to play it for

06:42.280 --> 06:44.840
yourself, now's your chance to skedaddle.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.960
Before Final Fantasy XVI launched, Yoshi P announced that there would be no black people

06:48.960 --> 06:49.960
in the game.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.900
His reasoning was that the game's setting was inspired by medieval Europe, and black

06:52.900 --> 06:56.560
people simply didn't fit into his vision of the game's various kingdoms.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.900
Having now finished the game, I'll confirm that yes, there are no black people in the

06:59.900 --> 07:01.300
world of Valisthea.

07:01.300 --> 07:06.480
The expansionist Empire of Sembrech, the isolationist Kingdom of Veloud, and the tiny Duchy of Rosaria

07:06.480 --> 07:11.120
all appear to be vaguely based on various European feudal realms, while the Iron Kingdom

07:11.120 --> 07:12.760
to the west is a pirate kingdom.

07:12.760 --> 07:17.460
Each of these locations are home to a different ethnic group in the lore, but they all look

07:17.460 --> 07:18.460
European.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.820
The Dalmekian Republic to the south is the only nation with an elected parliament.

07:21.820 --> 07:26.120
They appear to be vaguely Arab or Turkic, with notably different architecture, customs,

07:26.120 --> 07:28.680
food, and environment than the rest of the game world.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.960
It seems like the game designers wanted to make the continent feel like Europe with all

07:31.960 --> 07:36.000
of its squabbling kingdoms, and just on the edge of European understanding was the Middle

07:36.000 --> 07:37.720
East with its alien ideas.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
And you know what?

07:38.720 --> 07:39.720
They did a pretty good job at it.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.980
Yeah, the Middle East wasn't, and still isn't, democratic, but you get the point.

07:42.980 --> 07:46.760
This is a story that the west can intuitively pick up on from our own cultural background,

07:46.760 --> 07:51.320
but it also doesn't really have room for random black people to simply exist as background

07:51.320 --> 07:54.180
peasants like we're watching the rings of power or something.

07:54.180 --> 07:58.780
These are ethnically homogenous societies, not mixed interracial ones.

07:58.780 --> 08:03.800
But the usual progressive suspects got very, very angry at the state of affairs.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.880
Their outrage mirrored the reaction to Kingdom Come Deliverance years ago, where that game

08:07.880 --> 08:13.340
was set in a historically accurate kingdom of Bohemia in 1403, meaning no ethnic non-European

08:13.340 --> 08:15.300
characters were featured in the game.

08:15.300 --> 08:19.280
Final Fantasy XVI has no business abiding by historical realism.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.840
Final Fantasy XVI has a medieval approach to diversity.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.980
Final Fantasy XVI developer has a terrible answer as to why the game is so white.

08:25.980 --> 08:29.980
Yoshi P's answer is pretty obvious to anybody who's not ideologically motivated, but it's

08:29.980 --> 08:31.780
an answer that game journals just can't accept.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.920
Here's what he said about it in the interview.

08:33.920 --> 08:37.780
This is a difficult question, but not one that was unexpected, seeing as diversity in

08:37.780 --> 08:41.200
entertainment media has become a much-discussed topic as of late.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.420
The answer I have, however, may end up being disappointing to some, depending on individual

08:45.420 --> 08:46.420
expectations.

08:46.420 --> 08:49.380
Rather than create something on a global scale, it was necessary to limit the scope

08:49.380 --> 08:54.100
to a single landmass, one geographically and culturally isolated from the rest of the world,

08:54.100 --> 08:56.780
in an age without airplanes, television, or phones.

08:56.780 --> 09:01.180
Due to the underlying geographical, technological, and geopolitical constraints of this setting,

09:01.180 --> 09:05.780
Valisthea was never going to realistically be as diverse as, say, modern-day Earth, or

09:05.780 --> 09:11.260
even Final Fantasy XIV that has an entire planet and moon worth of nations, races, and

09:11.260 --> 09:12.980
cultures at its disposal.

09:12.980 --> 09:17.620
The isolated nature of this realm, however, does end up playing a large part in the story.

09:17.620 --> 09:21.820
Ultimately, we felt that while incorporating ethnic diversity into Valisthea was important,

09:21.820 --> 09:26.220
an over-incorporation into the single corner of a much larger world could end up causing

09:26.220 --> 09:29.900
a violation of those narrative boundaries we originally set for ourselves.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.980
The story we are telling is fantasy, yes, but it's also rooted in reality.

09:33.980 --> 09:38.280
In the end, we simply want the focus to be less on the outward appearance of our characters

09:38.280 --> 09:40.520
and more on who they are as people.

09:40.520 --> 09:45.400
People who are complex and diverse in their natures, backgrounds, beliefs, personalities,

09:45.400 --> 09:46.560
and motivations.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.480
People whose stories we can resonate with.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.020
There is diversity in Valisthea.

09:51.020 --> 09:54.560
Diversity that, while not all-encompassing, is synergistic with the setting we've created

09:54.560 --> 09:57.360
and is true to the inspirations from which we're drawing.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.040
How do you think the Progs took this?

09:59.040 --> 10:03.500
From the Verge, this idea of Final Fantasy XVI being rooted in reality is likely going

10:03.500 --> 10:07.300
to end up hurting the developers' other, arguably more important goal for the game,

10:07.300 --> 10:09.360
which is to reach as big of an audience as possible.

10:09.360 --> 10:13.080
You know, based on those sales numbers, I don't think that ended up being a problem.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.240
Over at Kotaku, it made them go, yikes, in real life.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.240
And you know what?

10:17.240 --> 10:19.720
Maybe this is why y'all didn't get a review copy of the game.

10:19.720 --> 10:24.880
Between this, and Nintendo, and Bethesda, and Ubisoft, all blacklisting Kotaku for publishing

10:24.880 --> 10:26.220
leaked info?

10:26.220 --> 10:29.040
Does Kotaku get any review copies of anything anymore?

10:29.040 --> 10:32.040
So, the Progs were mad that there weren't black characters in the game.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.280
It's not like Final Fantasy has a history of only having white characters.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.360
Far from it, in fact.

10:36.360 --> 10:40.600
But after the game came out, their ire rapidly shifted in a pretty ironic way.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.840
Final Fantasy XVI suffers from its superficial handling of slavery.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.400
We need to talk about slavery in Final Fantasy XVI.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.640
Final Fantasy XVI fails its players and its world with its misguided treatment of slavery.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.080
Yeah, the game's got a fair bit of slavery in it, as well as open prostitution, another

10:54.080 --> 10:55.920
of its thematic ties to Game of Thrones.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.600
Here's the explanation of how magic works in Final Fantasy XVI.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.560
There are these giant mountains of crystal called the Mother Crystals.

11:02.560 --> 11:07.120
Pieces of crystal are mined off of these mountains and can be used to cast simple magic.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.320
Everything in Valisthea operates off of crystals.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.400
Street lamps, forges, water wells, crystals do it all.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.800
Bearers are people who are randomly born with the ability to cast magic without the use

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
of a crystal.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.480
However, doing so causes their body to slowly turn to stone.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.600
Bearers are treated differently in each society.

11:22.600 --> 11:26.600
In the Iron Kingdom, bearers are killed immediately as they're an affront to their religion.

11:26.600 --> 11:31.280
In Rosaria, bearers are culturally looked down upon, but treated as valued servants.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.960
Not equal, and certainly sometimes mistreated, but also generally not treated cruelly by

11:34.960 --> 11:36.120
their masters.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.880
In Sanbreque, bearers are chattel, used for labor until the curse renders them unable

11:39.880 --> 11:41.920
to cast magic, and then discarded.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.440
In overseas nations outside of the continent of Valisthea, bearers who are sold there are

11:46.440 --> 11:50.600
treated extremely well, as those locations don't have Mother Crystals, and therefore

11:50.600 --> 11:52.960
they have no other way to access magic.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.920
The exception to this rule are the Dominants, family lineages who can not only use magic,

11:56.920 --> 11:59.360
but transform into giant monsters known as Icons.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.760
They can nonetheless still fall victim to the curse of stone.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.480
The Dominants aren't relevant to the slavery conversation, though.

12:04.480 --> 12:09.400
In Final Fantasy XVI's world, the bearers occupy some kind of slave class or other type

12:09.400 --> 12:12.120
of underclass status in the various realms of Valisthea.

12:12.120 --> 12:16.620
They're not the only source of magic, so they can't just take over with their power.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.200
Regular humans can still use crystals.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.520
But having somebody who can cast magic without a crystal is pretty convenient.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.840
They're also rare and born at random.

12:23.840 --> 12:28.520
The state tracks every pregnancy and tests every child to see if they're bearers.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.400
It works a lot like the Jedi Order, in fact.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.000
If a child is discovered to be a bearer, they're taken by the state and placed into a life

12:34.000 --> 12:35.280
of slavery.

12:35.280 --> 12:39.040
Most parents are actually happy to have their child taken like this, as culturally being

12:39.040 --> 12:41.840
the parent of a bearer is considered embarrassing.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.600
For the majority of the game, you play as a revolutionary who not only wants to overthrow

12:45.600 --> 12:49.580
the various monarchies on the continent in the name of equality, but also destroy the

12:49.580 --> 12:52.880
Mother Crystals and abolish magic in order to free the bearers.

12:52.880 --> 12:57.600
The progressive complaints about Final Fantasy XVI revolve around the idea that this storyline,

12:57.680 --> 13:02.360
where the bearers are a slave class, is not treated with the undue care and respect that

13:02.360 --> 13:03.900
they believe it deserves.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.600
Instead of wasting time with large block quotes from the articles, let me just summarize to

13:07.600 --> 13:08.600
you their arguments.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
1.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.520
The protagonist of the game, Clive Rossfield, is a member of the royal family of Rosaria.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.360
He's not a bearer in the traditional sense.

13:15.360 --> 13:19.080
He was given fire magic due to the blessing of his younger brother, Joshua, the Dominant

13:19.080 --> 13:20.080
of Fire.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.300
At least, that's what everyone initially thinks.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.840
It's actually a late-game plot twist.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.220
They do something else entirely.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.380
But dominance can give non-magicked humans access to bearer-like magic, so it's a reasonable

13:28.380 --> 13:29.380
assumption.

13:29.380 --> 13:33.140
After Clive's mother betrays her country to send Breck and orchestrates an attack on her

13:33.140 --> 13:37.340
own family, I told you we'd be spoiling stuff at this point, Clive is presumed dead.

13:37.340 --> 13:41.940
His identity is legally erased, and he's sold into slavery as any other bearer.

13:41.940 --> 13:46.540
Despite this, the game doesn't really show the impact of slavery on Clive, even after

13:46.540 --> 13:50.000
he's been freed and meets up with Cid, the leader of the revolutionaries, fighting to

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
end slavery.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.720
I don't agree with this criticism.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.400
Clive is noble and energetic when we see him as a teenager, and he's sullen and defeatist

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
as an adult.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.600
And this is likely due not only to the loss of his family and country, but also to his

14:00.600 --> 14:02.140
current lot in life.

14:02.140 --> 14:06.900
We don't need to be shown the 13 years of Clive's torture, we can see it in his personality.

14:06.900 --> 14:10.960
When he first encounters Cid's little terrorist cell, Clive's attitude is one of, this is

14:10.960 --> 14:13.000
just the way the world is and we can't change it.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.160
And over the course of the game, he comes around to the idea that Cid's quest to end

14:16.160 --> 14:18.640
slavery in Valisthea is a moral one.

14:18.640 --> 14:23.360
When Cid dies at the game's midpoint, Clive takes on his name and continues his operation,

14:23.360 --> 14:27.880
and while him parroting Cid's viewpoint exactly down to the word is a bit on the nose,

14:27.880 --> 14:29.680
we understand that he's come around.

14:29.680 --> 14:34.600
Clive has the life experience of both highborn and low at this point, and unlike these articles,

14:34.600 --> 14:37.840
I don't think he's driven solely to honor Cid's memory.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.880
That's part of it, but I also think that Clive's been genuinely convinced of Cid's

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
position.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.680
Of course, Clive's interest in abolishing the slavery he sees and personally experienced

14:46.680 --> 14:51.400
does take a hard backseat to the whole killing god thing as the game ramps up.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.720
But hey, when the villain aiming at you is god, maybe emancipation has to wait a little

14:55.720 --> 14:56.720
longer.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.000
Two, the game journals view the game's solution to slavery as assimilationist.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.440
It's Cid's plan to destroy the Mother Crystals and abolish magic, which Clive continues after

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
his death.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.680
Cid's assumption is that if magic were abolished, then the bearers would have no reason to continue

15:09.680 --> 15:10.960
being enslaved.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.960
This is stupid.

15:11.960 --> 15:16.000
There's no reason the nobles wouldn't just keep the slaves they've already got, since

15:16.000 --> 15:19.240
they're already enslaved, and put them to physical work instead, like slavery in the

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
real world.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.720
Additionally, it places the burden of change on the enslaved.

15:23.720 --> 15:27.260
It says if you didn't have this quality, you wouldn't be a slave.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.720
The solution is to therefore remove the quality and make you like everyone else.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.720
The people who own slaves are certainly depicted by the game as morally reprehensible, but

15:35.720 --> 15:41.720
the solution the game's plot offers is less behead the slaver and more change the slave.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.320
Unlike the first criticism, this one actually has some weight, and I personally agree with

15:45.320 --> 15:46.320
it.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.640
But it's a very non-leftist type of analysis, isn't it?

15:48.640 --> 15:52.720
This isn't the argument of a political realist, of somebody who's employing some type of historical

15:52.720 --> 15:55.660
materialist analysis to the world of Final Fantasy XVI.

15:55.660 --> 16:00.160
A leftist view of the game's setting would reveal the economic forces at play.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.160
Magic is valuable.

16:01.160 --> 16:05.240
It's a method of generating more value with less labor, like using higher quality tools

16:05.240 --> 16:06.840
or machines in the real world.

16:06.840 --> 16:11.400
But since the bearers cast magic without the use of tools, they themselves are the means

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
of production.

16:12.480 --> 16:17.160
Looking at Final Fantasy XVI through a Marxist lens, the option of abolish magic suddenly

16:17.160 --> 16:22.120
makes a lot more sense, as doing so changes the relationship of the people with the means

16:22.120 --> 16:23.120
of production.

16:23.120 --> 16:28.240
The purely moral argument of, it doesn't matter what the status of magic is or how valuable

16:28.240 --> 16:33.560
bearers are, slavery is evil, while certainly true, is a position you can't arrive at solely

16:33.560 --> 16:35.320
through a materialist analysis.

16:35.320 --> 16:40.000
Rather, moral intuitions are its source, which means Jonathan Haidt, which means evolutionary

16:40.000 --> 16:45.360
psychology, and most leftists decry evolutionary psychology as biologically essentialist, therefore

16:45.360 --> 16:47.360
eugenicist, therefore fascist and evil.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.840
I don't think progressive games journalists are educated enough to follow the chain of

16:50.840 --> 16:52.720
logic here, but I'm sure you get it.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.880
TLDR, the second criticism is correct, but it's strange to see leftoids use it because

16:56.880 --> 16:59.320
they reject all of its logical foundations.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.320
3.

17:00.320 --> 17:04.060
The vast majority of the game that focuses on the Plate of the Bearers is side content,

17:04.060 --> 17:06.520
and you can go the whole game without even seeing it.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.520
This is, again, true.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.960
I remember one side quest, where a minor noble family was buying bears and having them get

17:11.960 --> 17:13.600
ripped apart by dogs for fun.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.880
They buy Clive, and being the main character badass he is, you kill the dogs.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.240
Angered by this, they resolve to buy even more vicious dogs and show you what's what,

17:22.240 --> 17:25.560
only to have the dogs immediately turn on them and rip them apart.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.680
It is exactly as ham-fisted as it sounds.

17:28.680 --> 17:32.840
Another side quest in the same area has a noble child hire you to find her pet Chloe.

17:32.840 --> 17:36.400
You discover that Chloe wasn't a dog or something, but a bear who had turned to stone due to

17:36.400 --> 17:37.760
using too much magic.

17:37.760 --> 17:41.560
The child had owned several bears, naming them all Chloe, but had rode each of them

17:41.560 --> 17:42.560
too hard.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.480
She doesn't even seem to recognize that Chloe was a person, and she considers the

17:45.480 --> 17:48.300
whole affair an annoyance now that she has to buy a new one.

17:48.300 --> 17:52.240
The progressive complaint is because all of this stuff is side content, players don't

17:52.240 --> 17:55.520
actually have to face the reality of bears in this world.

17:55.520 --> 17:59.060
They can simply skip the quests, which is the video game equivalent of turning a blind

17:59.060 --> 18:00.560
eye to injustice.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.860
This is a dumb critique.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.940
I still don't like this stuff personally, but for a different reason.

18:04.980 --> 18:08.700
Guests like these serve to outline just how bad bears have it in this world, but they

18:08.700 --> 18:11.140
are comedically, simplistically evil.

18:11.140 --> 18:14.500
The people who abuse bears are Saturday morning cartoon villains.

18:14.500 --> 18:18.260
In the real world, attitudes towards slavery weren't so cut and dry.

18:18.260 --> 18:22.780
There absolutely were some real shitheels who just did not give a fuck and worked them

18:22.780 --> 18:25.040
to death and raped them and all the rest of it.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.540
There were also people who believed that they were doing a good thing by owning slaves.

18:28.540 --> 18:32.620
A common belief in the American South was that black people simply were not capable

18:32.620 --> 18:37.040
of self-governance and needed to be ruled the same way that parents rule their children.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.760
For some of them, this was simply a post hoc justification of their exploitation, but others

18:40.760 --> 18:41.940
genuinely believed it.

18:41.940 --> 18:45.260
That doesn't make what they did morally acceptable, obviously, I'm not saying that,

18:45.260 --> 18:49.400
but the person who is factually extremely wrong about the nature of his fellow man is

18:49.400 --> 18:53.860
not the same kind of person who is sadistically evil and aware of himself.

18:53.860 --> 18:58.040
Further still are the people who owned slaves while wanting slavery abolished, like many

18:58.040 --> 18:59.680
of America's founding fathers.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.840
They believed that while slavery was evil, as long as it was legal, they couldn't afford

19:03.840 --> 19:06.500
to not employ slaves in their businesses.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.480
If they took a moral stance and refused to use slave labor, they would find themselves

19:10.480 --> 19:14.200
at a consistent disadvantage against their less moral competitors.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.020
Their belief was that until the system itself was changed, they had no choice but to own

19:19.020 --> 19:22.640
slaves, as individual action in a vacuum would simply mean their own destruction.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.540
Again, this doesn't make it right, far from it, and maybe some of these people actually

19:26.540 --> 19:31.500
were also sadistic fucks who use this as a cover story, who knows, but surely at least

19:31.500 --> 19:32.700
some of them weren't.

19:32.700 --> 19:37.140
The point I'm making is that the lack of nuance in Final Fantasy XVI's slavery story

19:37.140 --> 19:38.660
makes it ridiculous.

19:38.660 --> 19:43.700
Every slave is the purest saint, every slave owner is the absolute worst person with no

19:43.700 --> 19:49.300
redeeming qualities or really, no characterization at all beyond just loving to pig fuck their

19:49.300 --> 19:50.300
slaves.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.200
But that isn't the game journal's critique.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.680
Their view is that the story isn't black and white enough, and also that you can just

19:55.680 --> 19:56.680
skip over it.

19:56.680 --> 20:00.440
Speaking of black and white, they've completely forgotten about the whole no black people

20:00.440 --> 20:02.480
complaint from back before the game came out.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.400
Man, can you imagine how that would have unfolded?

20:05.400 --> 20:11.220
Imagine an inclusively added black noble family, treating a white enslaved bearer like shit.

20:11.220 --> 20:15.640
It would make sense in terms of Valisthea's class dynamics, but I can already imagine

20:15.640 --> 20:16.800
their headlines.

20:16.800 --> 20:21.140
Final Fantasy XVI's racially insensitive scene ignores the real-world racism.

20:21.140 --> 20:25.640
These people really do just exist to hate on things that fall outside of the bounds

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
of their politics.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.080
Not even explicitly against their politics, just not explicitly for it.

20:30.080 --> 20:35.000
I wonder if that's why IGN recently published an article implying that Final Fantasy XVI

20:35.000 --> 20:38.920
caused Square Enix to take a massive financial hit, when in reality it was Square's other

20:38.920 --> 20:44.040
bombs like the Avengers game in Forespoken that lost them money, with Final Fantasy XVI's

20:44.040 --> 20:47.760
success being the only one of their properties keeping them afloat right now.

20:47.760 --> 20:52.880
I'll give you one final devian leap of logic before we wrap this up.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.600
All of these articles complaining about the Final Fantasy XVI treatment of slavery as

20:56.600 --> 21:00.420
a topic, they all hand-wave the whole killing god part of the story.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.780
To them it's an afterthought, like oh, the plight of the bearers takes second fiddle

21:03.780 --> 21:06.040
to the usual Final Fantasy schlock.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.040
And fair enough.

21:07.040 --> 21:11.640
But I'll tell you why I think all of these articles fail to go into that half of the

21:11.640 --> 21:13.120
story in detail.

21:13.120 --> 21:17.080
In their view, the whole Sid and Clive end slavery and overthrow the monarchy, that's

21:17.080 --> 21:19.160
a fundamentally leftist storyline.

21:19.160 --> 21:23.040
Reject the hereditary nobility, power to the people, French Revolution style, and Sid's

21:23.040 --> 21:26.680
ragtag crew contains a whole bunch of different types of people.

21:26.680 --> 21:30.680
Different ethnicities, nobles and commoners alike, all working hard to accomplish that

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
goal.

21:31.680 --> 21:35.240
Clive goes on and on about freedom and liberation and being down with the cause.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.580
It's the ideal lefty power fantasy.

21:37.580 --> 21:42.040
But when the plot shifts towards the killing god stuff in the second half, the ethic of

21:42.040 --> 21:44.200
the story also dramatically shifts.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.100
The use of magic causes blight on the land.

21:47.100 --> 21:51.140
Every force is sucked up from the land to cast spells, slowly killing everything.

21:51.140 --> 21:54.240
Yes, Final Fantasy as a series has a few core themes.

21:54.240 --> 21:59.580
And the idea of magic as a stand-in for fossil fuels and a pending ecological disaster resulting

21:59.580 --> 22:02.940
from its use by humans failing to maintain a balance with nature?

22:02.940 --> 22:05.740
That is a consistent one across most of the games in the series.

22:05.740 --> 22:10.300
The god in the game that we're fighting against is actually an alien being named Ultima who

22:10.300 --> 22:14.100
traveled to the planet the game takes place on, having destroyed his own world through

22:14.100 --> 22:15.840
overusing magic.

22:15.840 --> 22:20.360
After realizing that the blight was appearing on this new world too, Ultima devised a plan.

22:20.360 --> 22:24.600
He created the Mother Crystals, he created humanity, and then he entombed parts of himself

22:24.600 --> 22:26.280
inside the Mother Crystals.

22:26.280 --> 22:30.720
As humanity discovered magic, the blight would spread, but the spent magical energy would

22:30.720 --> 22:34.520
channel through the core of the Mother Crystals, Ultima's entombed parts.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.200
Eventually, humanity would produce an ideal vessel through which unlimited magic could

22:38.200 --> 22:42.080
be channeled, which Ultima could then possess seeing as he's a disembodied spirit.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.760
Naturally, this person is Clive.

22:43.760 --> 22:47.860
The story's not exactly clear on this next bit, but it's heavily implied that the capacity

22:47.860 --> 22:51.080
for consciousness is a key component of the spread of the blight.

22:51.080 --> 22:56.720
Humans, with will, casting magic, causes the land's aether to be consumed and lost, spreading

22:56.720 --> 22:57.720
blight.

22:57.720 --> 23:01.080
But an overabundance of aether in one location, a problem in the other direction, causes all

23:01.080 --> 23:06.060
the life forms in the affected area to lose their will, becoming what the game calls Akashic.

23:06.060 --> 23:09.640
In terms of game mechanics, this just means that there's stronger variants of regular

23:09.640 --> 23:10.640
enemies.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.960
But in terms of the story, Akashic creatures are philosophical zombies.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.600
A philosophical zombie is a thought experiment, where a person behaves like any other person

23:17.600 --> 23:19.600
but has no conscious experience.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.360
For example, if I were to poke you with a sharp stick, you would presumably feel pain

23:22.360 --> 23:23.520
and then react accordingly.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.440
But if I were to poke a philosophical zombie, while it might react exactly like you did,

23:27.440 --> 23:30.120
it would feel no pain, as it doesn't have the capacity for it.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.960
You could talk to a philosophical zombie and it would talk back to you like a real human,

23:33.960 --> 23:36.160
but there's no consciousness behind the eyes there.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.620
It's simply an acting and reacting automaton.

23:38.620 --> 23:41.780
In colloquial speech, the difference between a person and a philosophical zombie is that

23:41.780 --> 23:45.460
a person has a soul, while a philosophical zombie doesn't, it's simply acting like

23:45.460 --> 23:46.460
it does.

23:46.460 --> 23:51.460
It's going through extremely complicated, identical to humans, but ultimately pre-programmed

23:51.460 --> 23:52.460
responses.

23:52.460 --> 23:55.780
The point of the thought experiment is that it's one of the common results of having

23:55.780 --> 23:57.220
ultimate skepticism.

23:57.220 --> 24:00.820
You can't know if other people are having a conscious experience like yours, because

24:00.820 --> 24:02.080
you can't access it.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.900
While you do know that your own consciousness exists because you are literally it, you don't

24:05.900 --> 24:08.580
know with perfect accuracy if anybody else's does.

24:08.580 --> 24:12.460
You might be the only real person and everybody else is just a philosophical zombie, a meat

24:12.460 --> 24:13.460
puppet.

24:13.460 --> 24:16.220
Now you know what, that's not true, because obviously I'm the main character, you guys

24:16.220 --> 24:18.220
cease to exist the minute we stop talking.

24:18.220 --> 24:22.900
This is what's being expressed by that kinda creepy Divine Light is Severed meme from Cruelty

24:22.900 --> 24:27.660
Squad, where the caption says, Divine Light Severed, you are a flesh automaton animated

24:27.660 --> 24:28.660
by neurotransmitters.

24:28.660 --> 24:32.560
I don't know much about Cruelty Squad, but from what I can gather, this caption appears

24:32.560 --> 24:34.660
when you die and you're brought back to life.

24:34.660 --> 24:37.720
A new body is made and given your memories in the story.

24:37.720 --> 24:41.380
And since you're aware of this process, you know that you're not really you, you're

24:41.380 --> 24:44.640
just a facsimile meant to be indistinguishable from the previous you.

24:44.640 --> 24:48.380
This meme gained a lot of traction because of its real-world implications in the postmodern

24:48.380 --> 24:49.380
age.

24:49.380 --> 24:53.980
Before the Enlightenment, humans understood themselves as divine beings connected to God,

24:53.980 --> 24:57.620
and therefore they had a telos, making their actions a necessary part of putting the cosmos

24:57.620 --> 24:58.620
in order.

24:58.620 --> 25:02.180
But in the age of modern science, we've opened the hood on a lot of what makes us

25:02.180 --> 25:03.180
sick.

25:03.180 --> 25:06.580
And while we don't have ultimate understanding of everything yet, we do know that there probably

25:06.580 --> 25:11.900
isn't a soul, that consciousness is an emergent property of our brains and their firing neurotransmitters.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.460
Oh, real quick I guess.

25:13.460 --> 25:17.160
An emergent property is a thing that doesn't exist in isolation, but does exist as a result

25:17.160 --> 25:19.720
of the interaction between other systems that do exist.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.820
For example, in economics, the market doesn't exist, but it's a property that emerges

25:23.820 --> 25:27.400
when individual consumers make choices in a decentralized way.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.760
As a result of people buying and selling products at their own preferred rates of exchange,

25:31.760 --> 25:35.860
a market emerges, with efficient pricing based on supply and demand.

25:35.860 --> 25:39.580
If the people stop trading, the market vanishes, but the market exists as long as the people

25:39.580 --> 25:41.100
keep interacting with each other.

25:41.100 --> 25:45.560
The formation of snowflakes, the shape of flying flocks of birds, the behavior of traffic

25:45.560 --> 25:48.100
jams, these are all emergent properties.

25:48.100 --> 25:52.020
The pattern doesn't exist on its own, but it comes into existence when individuals do

25:52.020 --> 25:53.740
what they would normally do.

25:53.740 --> 25:56.840
Human consciousness is, as far as we can tell, an emergent property.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.300
There's no soul there.

25:58.300 --> 26:02.900
It seems like consciousness exists as a result of the various brain systems operating together

26:02.900 --> 26:04.140
in the way that they do.

26:04.140 --> 26:08.240
In fact, an extremely pessimistic view of this discovery is that we're all actually

26:08.240 --> 26:09.680
philosophical zombies.

26:09.680 --> 26:13.240
Yes, even you, even if you think you know your own consciousness.

26:13.240 --> 26:18.260
We're all just flesh automatons animated by neurotransmitters with no real consciousness,

26:18.260 --> 26:23.100
no divine light, and that what we think our consciousness is, is actually just a perception

26:23.100 --> 26:27.900
trick that our brains pull on us, and that what lies beneath the extremely thin surface

26:27.900 --> 26:32.260
is actually just a bunch of biologically pre-programmed and environmentally learned

26:32.260 --> 26:33.860
responses to stimuli.

26:33.860 --> 26:38.340
Well, ignoring that dark turn, going back to Final Fantasy XVI, Akashic creatures are

26:38.340 --> 26:41.220
lore-wise actually philosophical zombies.

26:41.220 --> 26:45.500
They're empty husks, simply reacting as their biology leads them around, with no semblance

26:45.500 --> 26:47.320
of understanding or consciousness.

26:47.320 --> 26:51.980
When animals become Akashic, they tend to live in unison and harmony with other Akashic

26:51.980 --> 26:55.100
creatures, even if one was a predator of the other normally.

26:55.100 --> 26:59.260
When humans become Akashic, they just stand around in one place waiting for stimuli.

26:59.260 --> 27:02.820
But all of them attack non-Akashic life on sight.

27:02.820 --> 27:07.000
Ultima can control Akashic creatures with his mind, making them march in unison or attack

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
with strategy.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.220
And when Akashic creatures use magic, the land's aether is not wasted, but collected.

27:13.220 --> 27:18.640
If humans, with will, casting magic, cause that magic to be expended and expand the blight,

27:18.640 --> 27:23.400
humans without will casting magic conserves the land's magic, causing it to concentrate.

27:23.400 --> 27:27.680
So Ultima's plan is to accelerate the spread of blight to weaken the planet's life, and

27:27.680 --> 27:32.080
then turn them Akashic with concentrated magic, allowing them to be empty vessels for his

27:32.080 --> 27:33.080
purposes.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.420
And Clive's body as the ultimate empty vessel he'll possess, allowing himself to cast

27:37.420 --> 27:39.280
magic without causing blight.

27:39.280 --> 27:43.840
The end result of Ultima's plan is what he considers a utopian society.

27:43.840 --> 27:48.200
All life forms stripped of their free will, existing in an equality of emptiness, and

27:48.200 --> 27:50.920
as such they'll no longer be capable of destroying the planet.

27:50.920 --> 27:55.120
Ultima himself lives on in Clive's body, using it to cast magic as he wishes without

27:55.120 --> 27:58.840
causing blight, since the body itself is technically also will-less.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.160
Don't worry, I haven't gotten lost in the weeds.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.880
I do actually remember that I'm supposed to be explaining why leftoids find this part

28:03.880 --> 28:07.760
of the story distasteful, as opposed to the whole overthrow the monarchy and liberate

28:07.760 --> 28:09.120
the slaves portion.

28:09.120 --> 28:14.040
The king of Walood, the dominant of Odin, Barnabas Tharmir, is Ultima's right-hand man.

28:14.040 --> 28:19.960
He has willingly sold his soul, or his neurotransmitters, to Ultima, as he actually views Ultima as

28:20.000 --> 28:24.760
a god, and agrees that his vision of a world devoid of consciousness is the only way to

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
stop the blight.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.340
Also, I guess having Ultima conjure up the naked form of his mother that he apparently

28:29.340 --> 28:32.600
has the hots for was a big reason for Barnabas getting onside.

28:32.600 --> 28:37.200
The point is, a lot of Ultima's philosophy is repeated through Barnabas as his earthly

28:37.200 --> 28:38.200
mouthpiece.

28:38.200 --> 28:42.520
They both believe that all of the evils and woes of humanity stem from free will, and

28:42.520 --> 28:47.040
that salvation is found in the equality of abolishing all consciousness.

28:47.240 --> 28:51.520
Clive takes up the individualist position in that debate, declaring that as his own

28:51.520 --> 28:53.560
person, he is inherently valuable.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.880
Even if Clive isn't perfectly equal to everyone else, that doesn't matter.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.400
His friends and his family are also individuals, they're different from him, and while that

29:00.400 --> 29:04.440
makes them not equals, since some are better in some ways and some are worse, that inequality

29:04.440 --> 29:05.560
doesn't actually matter.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.640
What matters is their relationships.

29:07.640 --> 29:12.300
Final Fantasy XVI presents the utopian equality of Ultima as being equivalent to the real

29:12.300 --> 29:16.940
world of the atomized individual, where everyone is isolated, everyone is interchangeable,

29:16.940 --> 29:18.400
and everyone is the same.

29:18.400 --> 29:22.580
While Clive's connections to Jill and Joshua and everyone else are rooted in individualism,

29:22.580 --> 29:26.680
they're not all the same, and that's why they can have relationships with each other.

29:26.680 --> 29:31.820
Because they're not equal, they have complementary attributes that give those connections meaning.

29:31.820 --> 29:35.540
Even though Clive is a rebel against the crown and the breaker of chains, that doesn't

29:35.540 --> 29:40.700
make Clive a leftist revolutionary hero, nor does it make Final Fantasy XVI a leftist game.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.420
In fact, it's quite the opposite.

29:42.420 --> 29:47.220
The ethics that drive Clive are equal parts liberal individualism and conservative traditional

29:47.220 --> 29:48.220
family bonds.

29:48.220 --> 29:52.480
To contrast, the ethics that drive Ultima are notions of equality, which necessitates

29:52.480 --> 29:56.860
interchangeability and disposability, and notions of utopia, which necessitates a complete

29:56.860 --> 30:01.740
wiping clean of all old orders and institutions, which is exactly what Ultima spends the whole

30:01.740 --> 30:06.220
game pursuing through his manipulation behind the scenes, goading all the various powers

30:06.220 --> 30:10.740
of Valisthea into destructive wars meant to abolish them all and create a blank slate.

30:10.740 --> 30:14.740
Again, as I've said many times in this video and on this channel in general, I don't

30:14.740 --> 30:18.660
think these people are educated enough to know what I'm talking about, but their intuition

30:18.660 --> 30:22.100
tells them to look at the Ultima storyline and say, no, this bad.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.300
They don't know why, not really, but I do.

30:24.300 --> 30:28.820
If you are the type of person to hold equality and revolution as first-order moral values,

30:28.820 --> 30:34.060
then a story where equality is depicted as lowest common denominator conformity and revolution

30:34.060 --> 30:38.420
as destructive to every good thing humans want, that would be a story that you intuitively

30:38.420 --> 30:41.500
find uncomfortable, even if you don't understand why.

30:41.500 --> 30:47.080
And Clive's focus on individualism and tradition, when revolutionary leftism is anti both of

30:47.080 --> 30:49.900
those things, is probably just as disquieting.

30:49.900 --> 30:53.140
Anyway, the game journals and the progs don't really think of the game in this way.

30:53.140 --> 30:54.800
They're not actively thinking this.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.540
Their intuition just takes them there.

30:56.540 --> 30:59.820
In the same vein, I don't think the game designers had this in mind either.

30:59.820 --> 31:03.820
Like, I don't think that Yoshi P intended to write some anti-communist moral tale using

31:03.820 --> 31:04.820
Ultima here.

31:04.820 --> 31:06.780
It came out that way for the same reason.

31:06.780 --> 31:07.780
Human intuition.

31:08.140 --> 31:11.780
It's kind of like how socialists online claim that the Federation in Star Trek is a socialist

31:11.780 --> 31:13.660
utopia because they don't use money.

31:13.660 --> 31:17.920
Even though private property still clearly exists, and Roddenberry was a liberal end-of-history

31:17.920 --> 31:22.580
type utopian who made one of the most enduring pop culture communist critiques in the form

31:22.580 --> 31:25.620
of the Borg, where everyone's equal in the Borg collective.

31:25.620 --> 31:29.740
It's one of those things where reading political theory allows you to word what is going on,

31:29.740 --> 31:32.980
but it's not really necessary because you intuitively get it when you see it.

31:32.980 --> 31:37.180
The world of equality is one where everyone and everything are the same, and forced to

31:37.180 --> 31:39.680
be so because of our innate differences.

31:39.680 --> 31:44.580
The world of diversity is one where differences exist, even if those differences generate

31:44.580 --> 31:49.300
inequality, because the differences are what make relations between individuals worthwhile.

31:49.300 --> 31:53.820
In other words, it's socialism versus liberalism, and that's why leftoids are complaining about

31:53.820 --> 31:57.500
Final Fantasy XVI's story, even if they don't know why they're doing it.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.740
Anyway, that's all I've got to say about this.

31:59.740 --> 32:00.740
Thanks for being here, guys.

32:00.740 --> 32:04.020
Despite its flaws, Final Fantasy XVI is still a good game, so if you like, pick it up.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.460
Oh, actually, I forgot, the game really is 10 out of 10.

32:06.460 --> 32:07.460
It's got Hodor.

32:07.460 --> 32:08.460
That's right.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.460
All is forgiven.

32:09.460 --> 32:09.480
Game of the year, baby.
