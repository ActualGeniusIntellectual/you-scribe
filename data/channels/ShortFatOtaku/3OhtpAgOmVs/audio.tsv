0	16300	The last time I spoke about Final Fantasy XVI on my channel, it was in the context of
16300	19400	a controversy surrounding Yoshi-P, the game's producer.
19400	24020	He made a comment to the effect that Japanese developers no longer like using the term JRPG,
24020	25820	which caused a whole firestorm.
25820	30140	But that video was about the game's pre-release controversy, and since then Final Fantasy
30140	33480	XVI has come out, been pretty well received by most people, and is considered to be a
33480	36020	contender for Game of the Year at the VGAs.
36020	39300	Though personally, I don't think it's going to beat out either Baldur's Gate 3
39300	40980	or Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
40980	44620	In fact, I think Zelda's got it in the bag, but if you watch my video on that, you'd
44620	46340	probably already know that I'm pretty biased.
46340	48780	Nonetheless, Final Fantasy XVI is a pretty good game.
48780	52020	It's not an amazing game, this isn't a return to the days when Final Fantasy was
52020	56260	a system seller, but it's certainly better than Final Fantasy X or XII or XIII.
56260	58100	Here's my general review of the game.
58100	61420	I won't spoil anything, so you have a chance to go and play it for yourself if you haven't
61420	64700	already, but the background footage I'm using is a random selection of the game's
64700	66340	side quests, so be warned.
66340	71100	Final Fantasy XVI's story has been described as Game of Thrones-like by a lot of reviewers,
71100	72100	and with good reason.
72100	75980	It's got that same type of gritty realism that Game of Thrones thrived off of.
75980	80260	Lots of violence and sexuality, political drama between noble families, medieval warfare.
80260	83380	The first half of the game genuinely feels like dark fantasy.
83380	87660	The second half of the game, though, returns to more general Final Fantasy fare, you know,
87660	91820	dealing with magic crystals and killing God, leaving behind a lot of the Game of Thrones
91820	93340	elements in its storytelling.
93340	97660	In terms of combat, Final Fantasy XVI plays like a game from the Devil May Cry series,
97660	100360	which makes sense considering that the two games share staff.
100360	104820	The combat is entirely action-oriented, nothing turn-based whatsoever, and the game is full
104820	107820	of flashy, relatively easy-to-pull-off combos.
107820	111500	The number of consecutive hits is displayed prominently on screen, incentivizing you to
111500	116540	keep the combos rolling, as well as various multipliers for dodges or counters or cinematic
116540	117540	events.
117540	118540	Yes, cinematic.
118540	120620	Our good ol' friend the QuickTime event makes a return.
120620	124940	Climactic battles often see the player take control of large monsters, where their moves
124940	127400	are replaced with more extreme variations.
127400	130660	These are considered by most players to be some of the coolest parts of the game, and
130660	133700	there's enough time between them that they don't overstay their welcome.
133700	137380	Your character grows in power with level ups like in most RPGs, but the real advancement
137420	139200	comes in the form of a skill tree.
139200	142940	Unlocking more combat abilities is primarily done through spending your skill points, and
142940	145700	more skill trees unlock at various points in the story.
145700	149580	This is all very normal action RPG stuff at this point, nothing revolutionary here.
149580	152780	The equipment system is pretty rudimentary, but it does the job well enough.
152780	155600	Buying and upgrading items is also very normal.
155600	158180	You find crafting materials out in the world, you upgrade your stuff.
158180	159180	It's all very by-the-books.
159180	164580	However, the equipment system was the source of the first post-launch controversy.
164580	169100	Final Fantasy XVI includes Game Journal mode in the form of overpowered equipment that
169100	171340	you have access to right from the start of the game.
171340	173460	These are called the Timely Accessories.
173460	178340	The Ring of Timely Strikes allows you to execute complex combos by simply tapping one button.
178340	181320	The Ring of Timely Evasion turns on auto-dodge.
181320	185640	The Ring of Timely Focus turns on slow motion right before you're about to get hit.
185640	189500	The Ring of Timely Healing turns on auto-heal, meaning you'll automatically use a potion
189500	190500	when you lose health.
190500	195380	The Ring of Timely Assistance will have your dog companion, Torgul, act in combat without
195380	197140	having to give him commands.
197140	200380	These items are pretty cheap on their own, but then some people out there tried to make
200380	205220	the argument that Final Fantasy XVI was shit, most of them repeatedly posting this clip
205220	209440	of some dumbass streaming the game, holding the controller with one hand and button-mashing
209440	210940	one button while eating.
210940	214100	This was apparently supposed to be proof that the game sucked, but it turned out he was
214100	216020	just using the Game Journal items.
216060	220500	The game has an unhideable UI element right above the HP meter, so you can always tell
220500	222280	if somebody's using these items.
222280	225380	The developers specifically said it was so that people couldn't hide their use of the
225380	229580	item online, which is pretty funny since so many people fell into that trap.
229580	233560	Speaking of the dog acting in combat without commands, you do get a few party members,
233560	235100	but they add almost nothing to the game.
235100	238820	Yeah, they're characters with personalities, and you do care about them, at least if you
238820	241700	care about the story, but in terms of what they actually bring to the fight, most of
241700	244700	the time they're just slowly auto-attacking in the background.
244700	248300	The dog is by far the most useful, and by that I mean not at all.
248300	252340	It's not like in Final Fantasy XV where the AI-controlled characters actually contribute
252340	256300	quite a bit, or like in the Final Fantasy VII Remake where you can actually switch focus
256300	257420	and play as them.
257420	261180	Nope, in this game your guys just sit around and lightly swing their weapons once every
261180	262400	five seconds or so.
262400	265340	You will be doing 99% of the damage in Final Fantasy XVI.
265340	269060	Nonetheless, it's still pretty cool to see them represented as little Final Fantasy
269060	272000	VI-style sprites in the save and load screens.
272000	275380	Game design is where Final Fantasy XVI starts to get a little bit shaky.
275380	279040	The story's pretty good, but we've surpassed Metal Gear Solid's four cutscene length
279040	280040	at this point.
280040	284480	You'll be watching at least 20 minutes of dialogue and lore-heavy cutscenes after every
284480	285920	main story mission.
285920	288960	Some of them are actually quite gripping, which is what you want if you have to lose
288960	291800	control of the game that you're playing for what is the length of time of a block
291800	293080	of TV programming.
293080	296640	But others are just really, really boring, almost insufferable.
296640	298400	The writing's very hit or miss.
298400	301980	It really feels like they crafted a very intricate lore for this world and threw the
301980	306240	vast majority of it into logs you have to read, or even worse, in the game's lore
306240	310920	menu, while there's many missed opportunities for environmental or contextual storytelling
310920	312480	with the settings and characters.
312480	314880	The side quests are almost all boring fetch quests.
314880	319760	In fact, even a good chunk of the main quests in between climactic fights are just fetch
319760	320800	quests too.
320800	326400	The level design is not quite as bad as the legendarily awful Final Fantasy XIII's hallways,
326400	327720	but it is pretty close.
327720	332240	This world is not like the wide open area of Final Fantasy XV, full of cool things to
332240	333420	check out on the horizon.
333420	335780	Many of the levels are just hallways.
335780	339760	Monster encounters in the hallway, treasure chests in the hallway, cutscenes in the hallway.
339760	343500	When the hallway does open up slightly, it's a boss arena, before narrowing back down into
343500	344920	a hallway once again.
344920	346960	Side quests have you running up and down the hallways.
346960	350440	Sometimes the hallways criss-cross over each other, but there's never anything approaching
350440	352040	a maze or a dungeon.
352040	355880	Occasionally, the game opens up into a large field you can explore, usually accompanied
355880	359860	by a handful of side quests from the latest town that take you to multiple areas of interest.
359860	363720	And these places are pretty fun for a little while, but functionally they are just wider
363720	364720	hallways.
364720	366520	There's one way in, and one way out.
366520	370280	The saving grace for the game's side content is the hunt board.
370280	373360	Particularly ferocious monsters have a bounty placed on their head, and if you bring them
373360	374360	in, you claim the reward.
374360	377920	They're the most engaging non-story fights in the game, and they're a lot of fun to
377920	378920	do.
378920	383240	All in all, Final Fantasy XVI is a good game, but it doesn't break into excellent territory.
383560	386720	It's still worth playing, absolutely, but if you were thinking of picking up a PS5 just
386720	387840	for this game, no.
387840	390080	Wait until it comes out in a steam, maybe wait for a sale.
390080	394560	Like every new game coming out nowadays, though, somebody on the internet got mad at it for
394560	395880	some stupid reason.
395880	398840	To talk about that, though, I'm going to have to start spoiling parts of the game.
398840	402280	So if for some reason you were only here for my review of it, and you want to play it for
402280	404840	yourself, now's your chance to skedaddle.
404840	408960	Before Final Fantasy XVI launched, Yoshi P announced that there would be no black people
408960	409960	in the game.
409960	412900	His reasoning was that the game's setting was inspired by medieval Europe, and black
412900	416560	people simply didn't fit into his vision of the game's various kingdoms.
416560	419900	Having now finished the game, I'll confirm that yes, there are no black people in the
419900	421300	world of Valisthea.
421300	426480	The expansionist Empire of Sembrech, the isolationist Kingdom of Veloud, and the tiny Duchy of Rosaria
426480	431120	all appear to be vaguely based on various European feudal realms, while the Iron Kingdom
431120	432760	to the west is a pirate kingdom.
432760	437460	Each of these locations are home to a different ethnic group in the lore, but they all look
437460	438460	European.
438460	441820	The Dalmekian Republic to the south is the only nation with an elected parliament.
441820	446120	They appear to be vaguely Arab or Turkic, with notably different architecture, customs,
446120	448680	food, and environment than the rest of the game world.
448680	451960	It seems like the game designers wanted to make the continent feel like Europe with all
451960	456000	of its squabbling kingdoms, and just on the edge of European understanding was the Middle
456000	457720	East with its alien ideas.
457720	458720	And you know what?
458720	459720	They did a pretty good job at it.
459720	462980	Yeah, the Middle East wasn't, and still isn't, democratic, but you get the point.
462980	466760	This is a story that the west can intuitively pick up on from our own cultural background,
466760	471320	but it also doesn't really have room for random black people to simply exist as background
471320	474180	peasants like we're watching the rings of power or something.
474180	478780	These are ethnically homogenous societies, not mixed interracial ones.
478780	483800	But the usual progressive suspects got very, very angry at the state of affairs.
483800	487880	Their outrage mirrored the reaction to Kingdom Come Deliverance years ago, where that game
487880	493340	was set in a historically accurate kingdom of Bohemia in 1403, meaning no ethnic non-European
493340	495300	characters were featured in the game.
495300	499280	Final Fantasy XVI has no business abiding by historical realism.
499280	501840	Final Fantasy XVI has a medieval approach to diversity.
501840	505980	Final Fantasy XVI developer has a terrible answer as to why the game is so white.
505980	509980	Yoshi P's answer is pretty obvious to anybody who's not ideologically motivated, but it's
509980	511780	an answer that game journals just can't accept.
511780	513920	Here's what he said about it in the interview.
513920	517780	This is a difficult question, but not one that was unexpected, seeing as diversity in
517780	521200	entertainment media has become a much-discussed topic as of late.
521200	525420	The answer I have, however, may end up being disappointing to some, depending on individual
525420	526420	expectations.
526420	529380	Rather than create something on a global scale, it was necessary to limit the scope
529380	534100	to a single landmass, one geographically and culturally isolated from the rest of the world,
534100	536780	in an age without airplanes, television, or phones.
536780	541180	Due to the underlying geographical, technological, and geopolitical constraints of this setting,
541180	545780	Valisthea was never going to realistically be as diverse as, say, modern-day Earth, or
545780	551260	even Final Fantasy XIV that has an entire planet and moon worth of nations, races, and
551260	552980	cultures at its disposal.
552980	557620	The isolated nature of this realm, however, does end up playing a large part in the story.
557620	561820	Ultimately, we felt that while incorporating ethnic diversity into Valisthea was important,
561820	566220	an over-incorporation into the single corner of a much larger world could end up causing
566220	569900	a violation of those narrative boundaries we originally set for ourselves.
569900	573980	The story we are telling is fantasy, yes, but it's also rooted in reality.
573980	578280	In the end, we simply want the focus to be less on the outward appearance of our characters
578280	580520	and more on who they are as people.
580520	585400	People who are complex and diverse in their natures, backgrounds, beliefs, personalities,
585400	586560	and motivations.
586560	588480	People whose stories we can resonate with.
588480	591020	There is diversity in Valisthea.
591020	594560	Diversity that, while not all-encompassing, is synergistic with the setting we've created
594560	597360	and is true to the inspirations from which we're drawing.
597360	599040	How do you think the Progs took this?
599040	603500	From the Verge, this idea of Final Fantasy XVI being rooted in reality is likely going
603500	607300	to end up hurting the developers' other, arguably more important goal for the game,
607300	609360	which is to reach as big of an audience as possible.
609360	613080	You know, based on those sales numbers, I don't think that ended up being a problem.
613080	616240	Over at Kotaku, it made them go, yikes, in real life.
616240	617240	And you know what?
617240	619720	Maybe this is why y'all didn't get a review copy of the game.
619720	624880	Between this, and Nintendo, and Bethesda, and Ubisoft, all blacklisting Kotaku for publishing
624880	626220	leaked info?
626220	629040	Does Kotaku get any review copies of anything anymore?
629040	632040	So, the Progs were mad that there weren't black characters in the game.
632040	635280	It's not like Final Fantasy has a history of only having white characters.
635280	636360	Far from it, in fact.
636360	640600	But after the game came out, their ire rapidly shifted in a pretty ironic way.
640600	643840	Final Fantasy XVI suffers from its superficial handling of slavery.
643840	646400	We need to talk about slavery in Final Fantasy XVI.
646400	650640	Final Fantasy XVI fails its players and its world with its misguided treatment of slavery.
650640	654080	Yeah, the game's got a fair bit of slavery in it, as well as open prostitution, another
654080	655920	of its thematic ties to Game of Thrones.
655920	659600	Here's the explanation of how magic works in Final Fantasy XVI.
659600	662560	There are these giant mountains of crystal called the Mother Crystals.
662560	667120	Pieces of crystal are mined off of these mountains and can be used to cast simple magic.
667120	669320	Everything in Valisthea operates off of crystals.
669320	672400	Street lamps, forges, water wells, crystals do it all.
672400	675800	Bearers are people who are randomly born with the ability to cast magic without the use
675800	676800	of a crystal.
676800	680480	However, doing so causes their body to slowly turn to stone.
680480	682600	Bearers are treated differently in each society.
682600	686600	In the Iron Kingdom, bearers are killed immediately as they're an affront to their religion.
686600	691280	In Rosaria, bearers are culturally looked down upon, but treated as valued servants.
691280	694960	Not equal, and certainly sometimes mistreated, but also generally not treated cruelly by
694960	696120	their masters.
696120	699880	In Sanbreque, bearers are chattel, used for labor until the curse renders them unable
699880	701920	to cast magic, and then discarded.
701920	706440	In overseas nations outside of the continent of Valisthea, bearers who are sold there are
706440	710600	treated extremely well, as those locations don't have Mother Crystals, and therefore
710600	712960	they have no other way to access magic.
712960	716920	The exception to this rule are the Dominants, family lineages who can not only use magic,
716920	719360	but transform into giant monsters known as Icons.
719360	721760	They can nonetheless still fall victim to the curse of stone.
721760	724480	The Dominants aren't relevant to the slavery conversation, though.
724480	729400	In Final Fantasy XVI's world, the bearers occupy some kind of slave class or other type
729400	732120	of underclass status in the various realms of Valisthea.
732120	736620	They're not the only source of magic, so they can't just take over with their power.
736620	738200	Regular humans can still use crystals.
738200	741520	But having somebody who can cast magic without a crystal is pretty convenient.
741520	743840	They're also rare and born at random.
743840	748520	The state tracks every pregnancy and tests every child to see if they're bearers.
748520	750400	It works a lot like the Jedi Order, in fact.
750400	754000	If a child is discovered to be a bearer, they're taken by the state and placed into a life
754000	755280	of slavery.
755280	759040	Most parents are actually happy to have their child taken like this, as culturally being
759040	761840	the parent of a bearer is considered embarrassing.
761840	765600	For the majority of the game, you play as a revolutionary who not only wants to overthrow
765600	769580	the various monarchies on the continent in the name of equality, but also destroy the
769580	772880	Mother Crystals and abolish magic in order to free the bearers.
772880	777600	The progressive complaints about Final Fantasy XVI revolve around the idea that this storyline,
777680	782360	where the bearers are a slave class, is not treated with the undue care and respect that
782360	783900	they believe it deserves.
783900	787600	Instead of wasting time with large block quotes from the articles, let me just summarize to
787600	788600	you their arguments.
788600	789600	1.
789600	793520	The protagonist of the game, Clive Rossfield, is a member of the royal family of Rosaria.
793520	795360	He's not a bearer in the traditional sense.
795360	799080	He was given fire magic due to the blessing of his younger brother, Joshua, the Dominant
799080	800080	of Fire.
800080	801300	At least, that's what everyone initially thinks.
801300	802840	It's actually a late-game plot twist.
802840	804220	They do something else entirely.
804220	808380	But dominance can give non-magicked humans access to bearer-like magic, so it's a reasonable
808380	809380	assumption.
809380	813140	After Clive's mother betrays her country to send Breck and orchestrates an attack on her
813140	817340	own family, I told you we'd be spoiling stuff at this point, Clive is presumed dead.
817340	821940	His identity is legally erased, and he's sold into slavery as any other bearer.
821940	826540	Despite this, the game doesn't really show the impact of slavery on Clive, even after
826540	830000	he's been freed and meets up with Cid, the leader of the revolutionaries, fighting to
830000	831000	end slavery.
831000	832720	I don't agree with this criticism.
832720	836400	Clive is noble and energetic when we see him as a teenager, and he's sullen and defeatist
836400	837400	as an adult.
837400	840600	And this is likely due not only to the loss of his family and country, but also to his
840600	842140	current lot in life.
842140	846900	We don't need to be shown the 13 years of Clive's torture, we can see it in his personality.
846900	850960	When he first encounters Cid's little terrorist cell, Clive's attitude is one of, this is
850960	853000	just the way the world is and we can't change it.
853000	856160	And over the course of the game, he comes around to the idea that Cid's quest to end
856160	858640	slavery in Valisthea is a moral one.
858640	863360	When Cid dies at the game's midpoint, Clive takes on his name and continues his operation,
863360	867880	and while him parroting Cid's viewpoint exactly down to the word is a bit on the nose,
867880	869680	we understand that he's come around.
869680	874600	Clive has the life experience of both highborn and low at this point, and unlike these articles,
874600	877840	I don't think he's driven solely to honor Cid's memory.
877840	881880	That's part of it, but I also think that Clive's been genuinely convinced of Cid's
881880	882880	position.
882880	886680	Of course, Clive's interest in abolishing the slavery he sees and personally experienced
886680	891400	does take a hard backseat to the whole killing god thing as the game ramps up.
891400	895720	But hey, when the villain aiming at you is god, maybe emancipation has to wait a little
895720	896720	longer.
896720	900000	Two, the game journals view the game's solution to slavery as assimilationist.
900000	904440	It's Cid's plan to destroy the Mother Crystals and abolish magic, which Clive continues after
904440	905440	his death.
905440	909680	Cid's assumption is that if magic were abolished, then the bearers would have no reason to continue
909680	910960	being enslaved.
910960	911960	This is stupid.
911960	916000	There's no reason the nobles wouldn't just keep the slaves they've already got, since
916000	919240	they're already enslaved, and put them to physical work instead, like slavery in the
919240	920240	real world.
920240	923720	Additionally, it places the burden of change on the enslaved.
923720	927260	It says if you didn't have this quality, you wouldn't be a slave.
927260	931720	The solution is to therefore remove the quality and make you like everyone else.
931720	935720	The people who own slaves are certainly depicted by the game as morally reprehensible, but
935720	941720	the solution the game's plot offers is less behead the slaver and more change the slave.
941720	945320	Unlike the first criticism, this one actually has some weight, and I personally agree with
945320	946320	it.
946320	948640	But it's a very non-leftist type of analysis, isn't it?
948640	952720	This isn't the argument of a political realist, of somebody who's employing some type of historical
952720	955660	materialist analysis to the world of Final Fantasy XVI.
955660	960160	A leftist view of the game's setting would reveal the economic forces at play.
960160	961160	Magic is valuable.
961160	965240	It's a method of generating more value with less labor, like using higher quality tools
965240	966840	or machines in the real world.
966840	971400	But since the bearers cast magic without the use of tools, they themselves are the means
971400	972400	of production.
972480	977160	Looking at Final Fantasy XVI through a Marxist lens, the option of abolish magic suddenly
977160	982120	makes a lot more sense, as doing so changes the relationship of the people with the means
982120	983120	of production.
983120	988240	The purely moral argument of, it doesn't matter what the status of magic is or how valuable
988240	993560	bearers are, slavery is evil, while certainly true, is a position you can't arrive at solely
993560	995320	through a materialist analysis.
995320	1000000	Rather, moral intuitions are its source, which means Jonathan Haidt, which means evolutionary
1000000	1005360	psychology, and most leftists decry evolutionary psychology as biologically essentialist, therefore
1005360	1007360	eugenicist, therefore fascist and evil.
1007360	1010840	I don't think progressive games journalists are educated enough to follow the chain of
1010840	1012720	logic here, but I'm sure you get it.
1012720	1016880	TLDR, the second criticism is correct, but it's strange to see leftoids use it because
1016880	1019320	they reject all of its logical foundations.
1019320	1020320	3.
1020320	1024060	The vast majority of the game that focuses on the Plate of the Bearers is side content,
1024060	1026520	and you can go the whole game without even seeing it.
1026520	1027520	This is, again, true.
1027560	1031960	I remember one side quest, where a minor noble family was buying bears and having them get
1031960	1033600	ripped apart by dogs for fun.
1033600	1037880	They buy Clive, and being the main character badass he is, you kill the dogs.
1037880	1042240	Angered by this, they resolve to buy even more vicious dogs and show you what's what,
1042240	1045560	only to have the dogs immediately turn on them and rip them apart.
1045560	1048680	It is exactly as ham-fisted as it sounds.
1048680	1052840	Another side quest in the same area has a noble child hire you to find her pet Chloe.
1052840	1056400	You discover that Chloe wasn't a dog or something, but a bear who had turned to stone due to
1056400	1057760	using too much magic.
1057760	1061560	The child had owned several bears, naming them all Chloe, but had rode each of them
1061560	1062560	too hard.
1062560	1065480	She doesn't even seem to recognize that Chloe was a person, and she considers the
1065480	1068300	whole affair an annoyance now that she has to buy a new one.
1068300	1072240	The progressive complaint is because all of this stuff is side content, players don't
1072240	1075520	actually have to face the reality of bears in this world.
1075520	1079060	They can simply skip the quests, which is the video game equivalent of turning a blind
1079060	1080560	eye to injustice.
1080560	1081860	This is a dumb critique.
1081860	1084940	I still don't like this stuff personally, but for a different reason.
1084980	1088700	Guests like these serve to outline just how bad bears have it in this world, but they
1088700	1091140	are comedically, simplistically evil.
1091140	1094500	The people who abuse bears are Saturday morning cartoon villains.
1094500	1098260	In the real world, attitudes towards slavery weren't so cut and dry.
1098260	1102780	There absolutely were some real shitheels who just did not give a fuck and worked them
1102780	1105040	to death and raped them and all the rest of it.
1105040	1108540	There were also people who believed that they were doing a good thing by owning slaves.
1108540	1112620	A common belief in the American South was that black people simply were not capable
1112620	1117040	of self-governance and needed to be ruled the same way that parents rule their children.
1117040	1120760	For some of them, this was simply a post hoc justification of their exploitation, but others
1120760	1121940	genuinely believed it.
1121940	1125260	That doesn't make what they did morally acceptable, obviously, I'm not saying that,
1125260	1129400	but the person who is factually extremely wrong about the nature of his fellow man is
1129400	1133860	not the same kind of person who is sadistically evil and aware of himself.
1133860	1138040	Further still are the people who owned slaves while wanting slavery abolished, like many
1138040	1139680	of America's founding fathers.
1139680	1143840	They believed that while slavery was evil, as long as it was legal, they couldn't afford
1143840	1146500	to not employ slaves in their businesses.
1146500	1150480	If they took a moral stance and refused to use slave labor, they would find themselves
1150480	1154200	at a consistent disadvantage against their less moral competitors.
1154200	1159020	Their belief was that until the system itself was changed, they had no choice but to own
1159020	1162640	slaves, as individual action in a vacuum would simply mean their own destruction.
1162640	1166540	Again, this doesn't make it right, far from it, and maybe some of these people actually
1166540	1171500	were also sadistic fucks who use this as a cover story, who knows, but surely at least
1171500	1172700	some of them weren't.
1172700	1177140	The point I'm making is that the lack of nuance in Final Fantasy XVI's slavery story
1177140	1178660	makes it ridiculous.
1178660	1183700	Every slave is the purest saint, every slave owner is the absolute worst person with no
1183700	1189300	redeeming qualities or really, no characterization at all beyond just loving to pig fuck their
1189300	1190300	slaves.
1190300	1192200	But that isn't the game journal's critique.
1192200	1195680	Their view is that the story isn't black and white enough, and also that you can just
1195680	1196680	skip over it.
1196680	1200440	Speaking of black and white, they've completely forgotten about the whole no black people
1200440	1202480	complaint from back before the game came out.
1202480	1205400	Man, can you imagine how that would have unfolded?
1205400	1211220	Imagine an inclusively added black noble family, treating a white enslaved bearer like shit.
1211220	1215640	It would make sense in terms of Valisthea's class dynamics, but I can already imagine
1215640	1216800	their headlines.
1216800	1221140	Final Fantasy XVI's racially insensitive scene ignores the real-world racism.
1221140	1225640	These people really do just exist to hate on things that fall outside of the bounds
1225640	1226640	of their politics.
1226640	1230080	Not even explicitly against their politics, just not explicitly for it.
1230080	1235000	I wonder if that's why IGN recently published an article implying that Final Fantasy XVI
1235000	1238920	caused Square Enix to take a massive financial hit, when in reality it was Square's other
1238920	1244040	bombs like the Avengers game in Forespoken that lost them money, with Final Fantasy XVI's
1244040	1247760	success being the only one of their properties keeping them afloat right now.
1247760	1252880	I'll give you one final devian leap of logic before we wrap this up.
1252880	1256600	All of these articles complaining about the Final Fantasy XVI treatment of slavery as
1256600	1260420	a topic, they all hand-wave the whole killing god part of the story.
1260420	1263780	To them it's an afterthought, like oh, the plight of the bearers takes second fiddle
1263780	1266040	to the usual Final Fantasy schlock.
1266040	1267040	And fair enough.
1267040	1271640	But I'll tell you why I think all of these articles fail to go into that half of the
1271640	1273120	story in detail.
1273120	1277080	In their view, the whole Sid and Clive end slavery and overthrow the monarchy, that's
1277080	1279160	a fundamentally leftist storyline.
1279160	1283040	Reject the hereditary nobility, power to the people, French Revolution style, and Sid's
1283040	1286680	ragtag crew contains a whole bunch of different types of people.
1286680	1290680	Different ethnicities, nobles and commoners alike, all working hard to accomplish that
1290680	1291680	goal.
1291680	1295240	Clive goes on and on about freedom and liberation and being down with the cause.
1295240	1297580	It's the ideal lefty power fantasy.
1297580	1302040	But when the plot shifts towards the killing god stuff in the second half, the ethic of
1302040	1304200	the story also dramatically shifts.
1304200	1307100	The use of magic causes blight on the land.
1307100	1311140	Every force is sucked up from the land to cast spells, slowly killing everything.
1311140	1314240	Yes, Final Fantasy as a series has a few core themes.
1314240	1319580	And the idea of magic as a stand-in for fossil fuels and a pending ecological disaster resulting
1319580	1322940	from its use by humans failing to maintain a balance with nature?
1322940	1325740	That is a consistent one across most of the games in the series.
1325740	1330300	The god in the game that we're fighting against is actually an alien being named Ultima who
1330300	1334100	traveled to the planet the game takes place on, having destroyed his own world through
1334100	1335840	overusing magic.
1335840	1340360	After realizing that the blight was appearing on this new world too, Ultima devised a plan.
1340360	1344600	He created the Mother Crystals, he created humanity, and then he entombed parts of himself
1344600	1346280	inside the Mother Crystals.
1346280	1350720	As humanity discovered magic, the blight would spread, but the spent magical energy would
1350720	1354520	channel through the core of the Mother Crystals, Ultima's entombed parts.
1354520	1358200	Eventually, humanity would produce an ideal vessel through which unlimited magic could
1358200	1362080	be channeled, which Ultima could then possess seeing as he's a disembodied spirit.
1362080	1363760	Naturally, this person is Clive.
1363760	1367860	The story's not exactly clear on this next bit, but it's heavily implied that the capacity
1367860	1371080	for consciousness is a key component of the spread of the blight.
1371080	1376720	Humans, with will, casting magic, causes the land's aether to be consumed and lost, spreading
1376720	1377720	blight.
1377720	1381080	But an overabundance of aether in one location, a problem in the other direction, causes all
1381080	1386060	the life forms in the affected area to lose their will, becoming what the game calls Akashic.
1386060	1389640	In terms of game mechanics, this just means that there's stronger variants of regular
1389640	1390640	enemies.
1390640	1393960	But in terms of the story, Akashic creatures are philosophical zombies.
1393960	1397600	A philosophical zombie is a thought experiment, where a person behaves like any other person
1397600	1399600	but has no conscious experience.
1399600	1402360	For example, if I were to poke you with a sharp stick, you would presumably feel pain
1402360	1403520	and then react accordingly.
1403520	1407440	But if I were to poke a philosophical zombie, while it might react exactly like you did,
1407440	1410120	it would feel no pain, as it doesn't have the capacity for it.
1410120	1413960	You could talk to a philosophical zombie and it would talk back to you like a real human,
1413960	1416160	but there's no consciousness behind the eyes there.
1416160	1418620	It's simply an acting and reacting automaton.
1418620	1421780	In colloquial speech, the difference between a person and a philosophical zombie is that
1421780	1425460	a person has a soul, while a philosophical zombie doesn't, it's simply acting like
1425460	1426460	it does.
1426460	1431460	It's going through extremely complicated, identical to humans, but ultimately pre-programmed
1431460	1432460	responses.
1432460	1435780	The point of the thought experiment is that it's one of the common results of having
1435780	1437220	ultimate skepticism.
1437220	1440820	You can't know if other people are having a conscious experience like yours, because
1440820	1442080	you can't access it.
1442080	1445900	While you do know that your own consciousness exists because you are literally it, you don't
1445900	1448580	know with perfect accuracy if anybody else's does.
1448580	1452460	You might be the only real person and everybody else is just a philosophical zombie, a meat
1452460	1453460	puppet.
1453460	1456220	Now you know what, that's not true, because obviously I'm the main character, you guys
1456220	1458220	cease to exist the minute we stop talking.
1458220	1462900	This is what's being expressed by that kinda creepy Divine Light is Severed meme from Cruelty
1462900	1467660	Squad, where the caption says, Divine Light Severed, you are a flesh automaton animated
1467660	1468660	by neurotransmitters.
1468660	1472560	I don't know much about Cruelty Squad, but from what I can gather, this caption appears
1472560	1474660	when you die and you're brought back to life.
1474660	1477720	A new body is made and given your memories in the story.
1477720	1481380	And since you're aware of this process, you know that you're not really you, you're
1481380	1484640	just a facsimile meant to be indistinguishable from the previous you.
1484640	1488380	This meme gained a lot of traction because of its real-world implications in the postmodern
1488380	1489380	age.
1489380	1493980	Before the Enlightenment, humans understood themselves as divine beings connected to God,
1493980	1497620	and therefore they had a telos, making their actions a necessary part of putting the cosmos
1497620	1498620	in order.
1498620	1502180	But in the age of modern science, we've opened the hood on a lot of what makes us
1502180	1503180	sick.
1503180	1506580	And while we don't have ultimate understanding of everything yet, we do know that there probably
1506580	1511900	isn't a soul, that consciousness is an emergent property of our brains and their firing neurotransmitters.
1511900	1513460	Oh, real quick I guess.
1513460	1517160	An emergent property is a thing that doesn't exist in isolation, but does exist as a result
1517160	1519720	of the interaction between other systems that do exist.
1519720	1523820	For example, in economics, the market doesn't exist, but it's a property that emerges
1523820	1527400	when individual consumers make choices in a decentralized way.
1527400	1531760	As a result of people buying and selling products at their own preferred rates of exchange,
1531760	1535860	a market emerges, with efficient pricing based on supply and demand.
1535860	1539580	If the people stop trading, the market vanishes, but the market exists as long as the people
1539580	1541100	keep interacting with each other.
1541100	1545560	The formation of snowflakes, the shape of flying flocks of birds, the behavior of traffic
1545560	1548100	jams, these are all emergent properties.
1548100	1552020	The pattern doesn't exist on its own, but it comes into existence when individuals do
1552020	1553740	what they would normally do.
1553740	1556840	Human consciousness is, as far as we can tell, an emergent property.
1556840	1558300	There's no soul there.
1558300	1562900	It seems like consciousness exists as a result of the various brain systems operating together
1562900	1564140	in the way that they do.
1564140	1568240	In fact, an extremely pessimistic view of this discovery is that we're all actually
1568240	1569680	philosophical zombies.
1569680	1573240	Yes, even you, even if you think you know your own consciousness.
1573240	1578260	We're all just flesh automatons animated by neurotransmitters with no real consciousness,
1578260	1583100	no divine light, and that what we think our consciousness is, is actually just a perception
1583100	1587900	trick that our brains pull on us, and that what lies beneath the extremely thin surface
1587900	1592260	is actually just a bunch of biologically pre-programmed and environmentally learned
1592260	1593860	responses to stimuli.
1593860	1598340	Well, ignoring that dark turn, going back to Final Fantasy XVI, Akashic creatures are
1598340	1601220	lore-wise actually philosophical zombies.
1601220	1605500	They're empty husks, simply reacting as their biology leads them around, with no semblance
1605500	1607320	of understanding or consciousness.
1607320	1611980	When animals become Akashic, they tend to live in unison and harmony with other Akashic
1611980	1615100	creatures, even if one was a predator of the other normally.
1615100	1619260	When humans become Akashic, they just stand around in one place waiting for stimuli.
1619260	1622820	But all of them attack non-Akashic life on sight.
1622820	1627000	Ultima can control Akashic creatures with his mind, making them march in unison or attack
1627000	1628000	with strategy.
1628000	1633220	And when Akashic creatures use magic, the land's aether is not wasted, but collected.
1633220	1638640	If humans, with will, casting magic, cause that magic to be expended and expand the blight,
1638640	1643400	humans without will casting magic conserves the land's magic, causing it to concentrate.
1643400	1647680	So Ultima's plan is to accelerate the spread of blight to weaken the planet's life, and
1647680	1652080	then turn them Akashic with concentrated magic, allowing them to be empty vessels for his
1652080	1653080	purposes.
1653080	1657420	And Clive's body as the ultimate empty vessel he'll possess, allowing himself to cast
1657420	1659280	magic without causing blight.
1659280	1663840	The end result of Ultima's plan is what he considers a utopian society.
1663840	1668200	All life forms stripped of their free will, existing in an equality of emptiness, and
1668200	1670920	as such they'll no longer be capable of destroying the planet.
1670920	1675120	Ultima himself lives on in Clive's body, using it to cast magic as he wishes without
1675120	1678840	causing blight, since the body itself is technically also will-less.
1678840	1680160	Don't worry, I haven't gotten lost in the weeds.
1680160	1683880	I do actually remember that I'm supposed to be explaining why leftoids find this part
1683880	1687760	of the story distasteful, as opposed to the whole overthrow the monarchy and liberate
1687760	1689120	the slaves portion.
1689120	1694040	The king of Walood, the dominant of Odin, Barnabas Tharmir, is Ultima's right-hand man.
1694040	1699960	He has willingly sold his soul, or his neurotransmitters, to Ultima, as he actually views Ultima as
1700000	1704760	a god, and agrees that his vision of a world devoid of consciousness is the only way to
1704760	1705760	stop the blight.
1705760	1709340	Also, I guess having Ultima conjure up the naked form of his mother that he apparently
1709340	1712600	has the hots for was a big reason for Barnabas getting onside.
1712600	1717200	The point is, a lot of Ultima's philosophy is repeated through Barnabas as his earthly
1717200	1718200	mouthpiece.
1718200	1722520	They both believe that all of the evils and woes of humanity stem from free will, and
1722520	1727040	that salvation is found in the equality of abolishing all consciousness.
1727240	1731520	Clive takes up the individualist position in that debate, declaring that as his own
1731520	1733560	person, he is inherently valuable.
1733560	1736880	Even if Clive isn't perfectly equal to everyone else, that doesn't matter.
1736880	1740400	His friends and his family are also individuals, they're different from him, and while that
1740400	1744440	makes them not equals, since some are better in some ways and some are worse, that inequality
1744440	1745560	doesn't actually matter.
1745560	1747640	What matters is their relationships.
1747640	1752300	Final Fantasy XVI presents the utopian equality of Ultima as being equivalent to the real
1752300	1756940	world of the atomized individual, where everyone is isolated, everyone is interchangeable,
1756940	1758400	and everyone is the same.
1758400	1762580	While Clive's connections to Jill and Joshua and everyone else are rooted in individualism,
1762580	1766680	they're not all the same, and that's why they can have relationships with each other.
1766680	1771820	Because they're not equal, they have complementary attributes that give those connections meaning.
1771820	1775540	Even though Clive is a rebel against the crown and the breaker of chains, that doesn't
1775540	1780700	make Clive a leftist revolutionary hero, nor does it make Final Fantasy XVI a leftist game.
1780700	1782420	In fact, it's quite the opposite.
1782420	1787220	The ethics that drive Clive are equal parts liberal individualism and conservative traditional
1787220	1788220	family bonds.
1788220	1792480	To contrast, the ethics that drive Ultima are notions of equality, which necessitates
1792480	1796860	interchangeability and disposability, and notions of utopia, which necessitates a complete
1796860	1801740	wiping clean of all old orders and institutions, which is exactly what Ultima spends the whole
1801740	1806220	game pursuing through his manipulation behind the scenes, goading all the various powers
1806220	1810740	of Valisthea into destructive wars meant to abolish them all and create a blank slate.
1810740	1814740	Again, as I've said many times in this video and on this channel in general, I don't
1814740	1818660	think these people are educated enough to know what I'm talking about, but their intuition
1818660	1822100	tells them to look at the Ultima storyline and say, no, this bad.
1822100	1824300	They don't know why, not really, but I do.
1824300	1828820	If you are the type of person to hold equality and revolution as first-order moral values,
1828820	1834060	then a story where equality is depicted as lowest common denominator conformity and revolution
1834060	1838420	as destructive to every good thing humans want, that would be a story that you intuitively
1838420	1841500	find uncomfortable, even if you don't understand why.
1841500	1847080	And Clive's focus on individualism and tradition, when revolutionary leftism is anti both of
1847080	1849900	those things, is probably just as disquieting.
1849900	1853140	Anyway, the game journals and the progs don't really think of the game in this way.
1853140	1854800	They're not actively thinking this.
1854800	1856540	Their intuition just takes them there.
1856540	1859820	In the same vein, I don't think the game designers had this in mind either.
1859820	1863820	Like, I don't think that Yoshi P intended to write some anti-communist moral tale using
1863820	1864820	Ultima here.
1864820	1866780	It came out that way for the same reason.
1866780	1867780	Human intuition.
1868140	1871780	It's kind of like how socialists online claim that the Federation in Star Trek is a socialist
1871780	1873660	utopia because they don't use money.
1873660	1877920	Even though private property still clearly exists, and Roddenberry was a liberal end-of-history
1877920	1882580	type utopian who made one of the most enduring pop culture communist critiques in the form
1882580	1885620	of the Borg, where everyone's equal in the Borg collective.
1885620	1889740	It's one of those things where reading political theory allows you to word what is going on,
1889740	1892980	but it's not really necessary because you intuitively get it when you see it.
1892980	1897180	The world of equality is one where everyone and everything are the same, and forced to
1897180	1899680	be so because of our innate differences.
1899680	1904580	The world of diversity is one where differences exist, even if those differences generate
1904580	1909300	inequality, because the differences are what make relations between individuals worthwhile.
1909300	1913820	In other words, it's socialism versus liberalism, and that's why leftoids are complaining about
1913820	1917500	Final Fantasy XVI's story, even if they don't know why they're doing it.
1917500	1919740	Anyway, that's all I've got to say about this.
1919740	1920740	Thanks for being here, guys.
1920740	1924020	Despite its flaws, Final Fantasy XVI is still a good game, so if you like, pick it up.
1924020	1926460	Oh, actually, I forgot, the game really is 10 out of 10.
1926460	1927460	It's got Hodor.
1927460	1928460	That's right.
1928460	1929460	All is forgiven.
1929460	1929480	Game of the year, baby.
