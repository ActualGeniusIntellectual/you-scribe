Dude, why is Sargon a part of every recent controversy? He was the center of the slop

00:10.400 --> 00:14.840
gate thing from before, he's all over the starfield pronouns thing, and today's topic,

00:14.840 --> 00:20.000
the body count discourse, yeah that was Sargon too. Here's a reddit post that went viral.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.440
I, 27 female, hate how men value me because of my body count. So I've been with 58 different

00:26.440 --> 00:31.320
men which I know is higher than average but I wanted to have fun and enjoy new experiences

00:31.320 --> 00:35.800
and it's my life so I did. But I've settled down the last year and have really been trying

00:35.800 --> 00:39.820
to find someone special to settle down with and start a family. All my friends are now

00:39.820 --> 00:44.360
either married or in relationships now and whenever I meet a match with a man or meet

00:44.360 --> 00:48.020
one in real life and they always ask what my body count is and I tell them, they always

00:48.020 --> 00:52.860
make a disgusted face and unmatch or ghost me. I even met one guy who I liked so much

00:52.860 --> 00:56.760
and I thought he was so sweet who told me he wasn't interested in a woman with such

00:56.760 --> 01:02.440
high mileage and ended up dumping me. I cried my eyes out for days over it. I'm more than

01:02.440 --> 01:06.800
just the men I've slept with. I have a decent job, fun hobbies and interests and I'm still

01:06.800 --> 01:10.480
young but I guess I'm just a hoe in most men's eyes.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.800
Sargon retweeted this story with a caption. The question we must ask young women is this.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.080
Who told you it was acceptable to have a high body count? That person has ruined your life

01:19.080 --> 01:23.260
and dating prospects. You should be angry with them and ensure future generations of

01:23.260 --> 01:27.780
women are not deceived by them as you were. And of course, this got everyone really mad.

01:27.780 --> 01:32.120
How dare you say that a woman's past choices matter when it comes to her future attractability?

01:32.120 --> 01:35.600
Of course, in the real world, a woman's past choices do matter when it comes to her future

01:35.600 --> 01:39.640
attractability. But you know what? So do a man's. Not in exactly the same way, but it's

01:39.640 --> 01:43.940
not like men are somehow untethered from the consequences of their actions. But this actually

01:43.940 --> 01:48.460
was the first line of attack from progressives. One of the common replies was, what about

01:48.460 --> 01:53.860
men's high body count? Sargon replied, since women use virgin as an insult towards men,

01:53.860 --> 01:57.540
it seems that women find a man who hasn't penetrated another woman to be pathetic and

01:57.540 --> 02:02.260
scornful. Men and women are totally different. Women view the number of women a man has slept

02:02.260 --> 02:07.660
with as a measure of the value of that man. Now, this isn't exactly right. I know many,

02:07.660 --> 02:13.020
many women who would not fuck a guy who's been with, say, 100 or 1000 girls. But this

02:13.020 --> 02:18.260
is in the context of women using the words virgin or incel as insults. Here's the exchange

02:18.300 --> 02:22.340
being replied to. This woman says, I was single for a decent amount of time in my 20s and

02:22.340 --> 02:26.420
30s. I had fun. Make of that what you will. Now I'm in a relationship, which started when

02:26.420 --> 02:30.420
I was 35, and we have a young daughter. We have a normal relationship, hard times and

02:30.420 --> 02:35.220
great times. We share and often laugh about our prerelationship shenanigans with total

02:35.220 --> 02:39.140
honesty about all the different things we experienced. A guy replies to her, that's

02:39.140 --> 02:43.300
a funny way of saying you got ran through by Chad and Tyrone throughout your prime,

02:43.300 --> 02:47.040
and then you finally settled down with a simp who was completely unaware and oblivious of

02:47.040 --> 02:51.680
your whorish past when she became old, used up and blown out. Jesus. The woman replied

02:51.680 --> 02:55.920
to that. Well, look at that. After all this time on Twitter, I finally found the incels.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.960
Now I'm sure you know this, but incel means involuntary celibate. That means guys who

02:59.960 --> 03:03.920
want to fuck but can't fuck because they can't find a partner. There's also an incel

03:03.920 --> 03:08.400
community with guys who are honestly pretty sad and bitter about their lot in life. And

03:08.400 --> 03:11.840
you know what? Fair enough. If you thought you were a zero out of 10, lowest of the low

03:11.840 --> 03:15.840
male with no chance of ever getting a girl ever, that would probably be a pretty rough

03:15.840 --> 03:20.640
existence. However, there is legitimate misogyny in these communities too. Pent up resentment

03:20.640 --> 03:24.480
towards the women who find them ugly and the more successful men who actually find partners.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.360
I talked about this in my incel video years ago. But basically, the incel community is

03:28.360 --> 03:33.020
equal parts learned helplessness, legitimate helplessness, and legitimate hatred of women.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.000
A lot of these guys would actually end up a lot better off if they just finally got

03:37.000 --> 03:40.820
laid, but some of them definitely wouldn't be. Which is why the incel community has gained

03:40.820 --> 03:45.120
such a negative reputation online, and why the word incel is thrown around as an insult

03:45.120 --> 03:50.160
so commonly by women who are being judged for their sexual experiences by these guys.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.880
It's a way for them to sneakily judge their judges for their own lack of sexual experiences,

03:54.880 --> 03:57.480
while hiding it behind the veil of talking about a hate group.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.560
Here's what I mean. It was once very common for women to insult men by calling them virgins.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.120
The implication being, as Sargon said, women view the number of women that a man has slept

04:05.120 --> 04:09.280
with as a measure of value of that man. If a man's body count is zero, he's a pathetic

04:09.280 --> 04:12.680
failure and you can't attract women. I was certainly called a virgin by girls who hated

04:12.680 --> 04:16.620
me back in high school. Even after I actually got laid, they still called me that, because

04:16.620 --> 04:19.840
they know that guys tend to be sensitive about it, especially if it comes from a girl that's

04:19.840 --> 04:23.800
out of their league. But as the world moved more progressive and sex positive, shaming

04:23.800 --> 04:28.760
people for their sexual practices became unpopular. So, progressive women stopped saying virgin

04:28.760 --> 04:33.240
and started saying incel instead, masking their attack as being related to an online

04:33.240 --> 04:37.820
community with some pretty questionable beliefs. But more often than not, they're still referring

04:37.820 --> 04:41.400
to a man's lack of sexual experience. In fact, I had the opportunity to talk to one

04:41.400 --> 04:45.000
of the women attacking Sargon a little bit, a writer for the feminist rag Redux, and

04:45.000 --> 04:50.400
here's how that went. She said, this is clearly fake and written by some incel who loves fantasying

04:50.400 --> 04:54.000
about promiscuous women, aka women that sleep with other men and not them, being knocked

04:54.000 --> 04:58.960
down a peg. I replied to her with, here you are using sexual history to shame men through

04:58.960 --> 05:02.980
the use of the word incel, and you think it's bad to use sexual history to shame women?

05:02.980 --> 05:06.760
She replied, what's wrong with incels isn't their sexual history, it's their attitudes

05:06.760 --> 05:10.760
towards women. They're entitled, resentful, and misogynistic. Not all male virgins are

05:10.760 --> 05:16.240
incels. Okay, fair enough, but I did find several instances of her using the word virgin

05:16.240 --> 05:20.840
as an insult in the exact same way. It's not just incel subculture with you, you actually

05:20.840 --> 05:25.620
shame people for being virgins. You shame men for their sexual history. You are entirely

05:25.620 --> 05:30.520
guilty of this. You shame men for not having enough sexual experience, just as men shame

05:30.520 --> 05:35.360
you for having too much sexual experience. She said, again, it was the misogynistic attitudes

05:35.360 --> 05:39.000
towards the woman that was the problem. I replied to her, why do you default to talking

05:39.000 --> 05:42.780
about their sexual activity as your go-to insult then, rather than the actual topic

05:42.780 --> 05:48.140
at hand? Their attitudes. It sounds like sexual prowess is the only unit of value you understand,

05:48.140 --> 05:52.000
which is why you insult men using it and get so offended when you're insulted with it.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.380
Yes, I was pulling the idea from that one meme that we've all seen. She basically

05:55.380 --> 05:59.420
said, paraphrasing here, that when she insults men by calling them a virgin, it's due to

05:59.420 --> 06:03.320
their lack of experience. That it's valid to point out when a man appears to not understand

06:03.320 --> 06:06.840
the mechanics of sex, and that it's likely due to their lack of personal experience.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.360
I replied, so let me get this straight, you're insulting men for not knowing anything about

06:10.360 --> 06:14.180
sex by calling them virgins, and you're claiming that this isn't about shaming men

06:14.180 --> 06:17.480
for their sexual history? She then said, yeah I know this is getting long, we're getting

06:17.480 --> 06:20.920
to the end of it, where did I shame men in this tweet that we're talking about? It

06:20.920 --> 06:25.340
seems like I'm insulting people who don't understand sexuality is based on biological

06:25.340 --> 06:29.960
sex and not gender expression and saying they must not understand sex if they say that.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.600
I asked, and how are you insulting them specifically? She replied, by saying they clearly don't

06:34.600 --> 06:38.360
know what they're talking about. I then asked, using what terminology? Which is a

06:38.360 --> 06:41.820
question she never answered. That was a bit long, but I went through the whole conversation

06:41.820 --> 06:45.600
with you because I wanted to point out what happened with her, from a logic chain perspective.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.720
Most of these people will simply block you long before the inconsistency in their argument

06:48.720 --> 06:52.560
is laid bare like this, so I really wanted to see it through. She admits that she uses

06:52.560 --> 06:57.160
virgin, and frankly probably in cell 2, to not only insult some men's bad attitudes

06:57.160 --> 07:02.140
or bad behaviors or bad ideas about sex, but specifically to highlight that those bad attitudes

07:02.140 --> 07:06.820
and behaviors and ideas stem from their lack of experience. Even in instances where there

07:06.820 --> 07:12.020
isn't actually any bad attitudes, behaviors, or ideas, she still uses virgin as an insult

07:12.020 --> 07:16.820
because the idea of somebody who is so uneducated about sex that they don't understand the basics

07:16.820 --> 07:21.220
is humorous to her. In other words, she is judging men based on their lack of sexual

07:21.220 --> 07:25.540
experience, by calling them virgins and incels. The same way that men judge women based on

07:25.540 --> 07:28.820
their glut of sexual experience, by calling them whores and sluts.

07:28.820 --> 07:32.460
I have no evidence for this claim. This is purely conjecture, based off my own intuition.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.220
But I think, if you actually were able to follow the logic chain of most people who

07:36.220 --> 07:39.860
use incel as an insult, and they didn't just block you right away for daring to question

07:39.860 --> 07:43.820
them, you'd probably arrive back at this point eventually. Incels are bad because they

07:43.820 --> 07:48.340
have bad ideas about sex and women. Those bad ideas stem from lack of experience. I

07:48.340 --> 07:53.300
am making fun of them for their lack of experience, therefore I insult men for their sexual history

07:53.300 --> 07:55.980
while complaining men insult me for mine.

07:55.980 --> 07:59.100
Another claim that came out of the Sargon thread was that women can simply lie if they

07:59.100 --> 08:03.300
think their partner cares about their sexual history. This is true. But there's two problems

08:03.300 --> 08:07.540
with this. One, if you're willing to lie to your partner, you're a low quality human.

08:07.540 --> 08:10.640
Your partner deserves better, you aren't good enough for him, and you're going to have

08:10.640 --> 08:15.520
to routinely betray him as a part of the normal course of your relationship. Two, lies need

08:15.520 --> 08:18.760
to be maintained, and either you're going to have to be an expert manipulator, or you're

08:18.760 --> 08:22.420
eventually going to slip up and the truth will come out. It might take years, but for

08:22.420 --> 08:26.660
most people, it will eventually happen. The number of people who can maintain a perfect

08:26.660 --> 08:31.900
facade for decades is very low. That's why this isn't the own you think it is. You're

08:31.900 --> 08:35.100
simply admitting you're a horrible person if you do this.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.500
Here's another issue with that Reddit post. Many people replying to Sargon said that the

08:38.500 --> 08:43.140
post was fake. No woman would ever actually say, I've been with 58 men. And you know what?

08:43.140 --> 08:47.400
Fair enough. Any woman that I know who's actually promiscuous, they tend not to keep track of

08:47.400 --> 08:51.780
that exactly. She might say 60, she might say in the 50s or 60s somewhere, but to come

08:51.780 --> 08:54.580
out and say strictly 58, that doesn't usually happen.

08:54.580 --> 08:58.460
And this point gets me to the other side of the conversation. It is completely reasonable

08:58.460 --> 09:02.700
to judge people based on their past sexual experiences, man or woman. There's this idea

09:02.700 --> 09:07.620
among progressives of the atomized individual, the year zero moment zero blank slate every

09:07.620 --> 09:11.080
man where nothing in the past matters and the future isn't guaranteed. So the only thing

09:11.080 --> 09:14.760
relevant is this moment, which naturally leads to the idea that you shouldn't be judged for

09:14.760 --> 09:18.460
your past behavior. That's in the past, man. Why are you bringing that up? The conservative

09:18.460 --> 09:23.180
view is that we are our past. We are a continuum with our past selves and the present self

09:23.180 --> 09:26.780
is the culmination of everything we've ever done. The progressive view taken to its extreme

09:26.780 --> 09:31.740
leads to a lack of foresight and extreme self-indulgence. The conservative view taken to its extreme

09:31.740 --> 09:36.640
leads to an inability to grow, being constantly chained to your old mistakes. The golden mean

09:36.640 --> 09:40.740
therefore is understanding that you can change from past bad behaviors. They don't have to

09:40.740 --> 09:44.740
define you forever, but it takes hard work and self-transformation. And that's something

09:44.740 --> 09:49.780
you can't simply declare by fiat. Most men don't necessarily want a virginal wife or something,

09:49.780 --> 09:54.140
but they tend to want women around the same level of sexual experience that they have. The idealized

09:54.140 --> 09:58.300
first love is that you're both virgins and high school sweethearts or something. Most guys in

09:58.300 --> 10:02.500
their 20s who have around five previous partners are going to be fine with a girl who also has

10:02.500 --> 10:07.060
around five previous partners. There can be serious relationship problems if there's huge

10:07.060 --> 10:10.580
disparities. It doesn't mean the relationship is doomed, but it does mean you have a lot of work

10:11.260 --> 10:16.620
But most people are fine with someone who's more or less on their level. And since the average body

10:16.620 --> 10:20.820
count for both men and women is somewhere in between four and eight, most people are going

10:20.820 --> 10:25.380
to be fine. Now, I'm not saying that having standards is a bad thing. For example, if you're

10:25.380 --> 10:29.700
a very religious person, you might want an equally religious partner. And that means you might

10:29.700 --> 10:34.340
actually want that virgin wife or at least somebody with a low body count. But I don't think this

10:34.340 --> 10:39.020
whole body count conversation applies to people like that. And here's why. One, if a girl's got

10:39.060 --> 10:43.060
a high body count, you can generally figure it out without autistically asking about it on the

10:43.060 --> 10:46.500
first date. Picture it in your head. You've got a religious guy going out to meet with a girl for

10:46.500 --> 10:50.860
the first time. How she dresses, how she speaks, her interests, her history, they're all going to

10:50.860 --> 10:55.540
be pointers towards what sort of personal life she has. Hell, how you were introduced to her is a

10:55.540 --> 11:00.340
pointer. If you met the girl on Tinder and she shows up with a shaved side head and facial

11:00.340 --> 11:04.860
piercings and talks about going to art school, the chances of her being a virgin is very low. Not

11:04.940 --> 11:09.620
zero, of course. But I don't think you need to actually ask the body count question here. Two,

11:09.620 --> 11:14.260
this goes back to the self-transformation thing, a truly religious person with religious morals

11:14.260 --> 11:19.460
understands forgiveness. If you're a religious guy and you meet the blue sundress, Wojak GF,

11:19.460 --> 11:23.900
and she tells you that yes, before she came to God, she was promiscuous and she asked for

11:23.900 --> 11:28.060
forgiveness for it every day. And she's not simply lying to you, but she shows it in her actions and

11:28.060 --> 11:31.700
how she behaves in church, how she behaves with her family and her community. I find it hard

11:31.940 --> 11:36.300
to believe that a religious guy who truly followed that morality would reject her. I mean,

11:36.300 --> 11:40.360
he still might, but Christianity is all about forgiving those who fall to temptation and a

11:40.360 --> 11:44.820
true reformation goes a long way. This is ultimately the issue with a woman in this

11:44.820 --> 11:48.820
Reddit story, assuming it's a true story. The first thing is that she did what many men consider to

11:48.820 --> 11:53.540
be unattractive. If you think that that's unfair or only incels care about her or whatever, too

11:53.540 --> 11:58.500
bad. You can't shame people out of their sexual preferences. This is how it is and no amount of

11:58.500 --> 12:02.780
dismantling the patriarchy will change it. But the real nail in the coffin is that she's

12:02.780 --> 12:06.620
unrepentant. If you think there's nothing to repent for, then there isn't. Fine. There

12:06.620 --> 12:10.540
absolutely are men out there who believe that a high body count isn't something to repent for,

12:10.540 --> 12:14.980
and she can go for them. But for some reason, she's not. She's going for men who actually just

12:14.980 --> 12:19.220
aren't compatible with her sexual history. To them, there is something to repent for,

12:19.220 --> 12:24.100
and her unrepentance is just unattractive. Merrick, being a terminally online failed

12:24.100 --> 12:29.060
crumbtuber, chimed in by saying that the story must be fake because men never ask about the body

12:29.060 --> 12:33.380
count question, and that those who do are losers. They're not worthy of a woman's time. Except in

12:33.380 --> 12:37.940
this story, again assuming it's true, the woman seems quite put out by being rejected by these

12:37.940 --> 12:41.780
apparent losers who shouldn't be worth her time. I simply replied to her with,

12:41.780 --> 12:45.620
I'm still not going to date a woman with a considerably higher body count than me,

12:45.620 --> 12:49.780
as it's a sign that we have different moral tastes. I found a girl I match with nicely.

12:49.780 --> 12:53.060
I don't need to settle. And that's what's at the heart of the conversation.

12:53.060 --> 12:57.460
Unlike other people, I'm not going to judge women who sleep around and rack up a huge body count.

12:57.460 --> 13:02.020
I don't care. I don't hate you like some incels might. I just won't date you. You do you,

13:02.020 --> 13:08.100
and I'll do me. This is a moral conversation, and morals are at their heart a part of your intuition.

13:08.100 --> 13:12.900
One person replied to me asking, I'm curious what moral tastes you input on your perception

13:12.900 --> 13:17.300
of somebody's character because of their body count. I replied, if you value chastity,

13:17.300 --> 13:22.180
then not being chaste is inherently of poor moral character. If you don't value chastity,

13:22.180 --> 13:27.140
then it's not. She then asked me, do you have a logical reason to value chastity, or is it just

13:27.140 --> 13:32.820
vague personal interpretations or feelings? The issue is, that is what morality is. When

13:32.820 --> 13:36.900
something appears to be good or evil to you, it's because it feels good or evil.

13:36.900 --> 13:41.060
Even if you're a consequentialist performing some sort of calculation to get to your desired end,

13:41.060 --> 13:45.300
what you desire as the end is ultimately going to come down to personal taste.

13:45.300 --> 13:49.700
Some people don't care if their partner has a massive sexual history. Other people do care

13:49.700 --> 13:53.620
quite a bit. Neither option is objectively correct. It's all a matter of personal taste.

13:53.620 --> 13:57.380
And your personal taste is not something you should tolerate being shamed for.

13:57.380 --> 14:01.540
That's what's at the bottom of this conversation. When women have too many sexual partners,

14:01.540 --> 14:05.780
some men find them unattractive as a result. Not all of them, of course, but enough that it's

14:05.780 --> 14:10.420
an identifiable trend. The problem, though, is the double standard. That feminist women bristle

14:10.420 --> 14:14.900
at the idea of being held up to their man's standard, while they hold men up to their

14:14.900 --> 14:19.780
standard. On the other side, the more red pill types of men do this too. They hold women up to

14:19.780 --> 14:24.020
the standard of chastity and virtue while they themselves sleep around. It's the same problem,

14:24.020 --> 14:28.420
but the double standard is still at play. Both of these groups, the feminist women and the

14:28.420 --> 14:33.620
red pill men, will call their targets insecure. Those slutty women are just insecure. Those incel

14:33.620 --> 14:39.380
dudes are just insecure. But our society treats male and female insecurity very differently.

14:39.380 --> 14:44.180
If a man is called insecure, it's generally meant to be derogatory, like it's his fault he can't

14:44.180 --> 14:48.820
shore up his own mental state. If a woman is called insecure, she's cast as a victim, like,

14:48.820 --> 14:53.380
oh, she's traumatized or something. Even if both of these people were cheated on, the woman's a

14:53.380 --> 14:59.300
victim, the man needs to get a grip. Our society views male insecurities as inherently unjustified,

14:59.300 --> 15:03.860
stemming from a personal fault, while women's insecurities are the fault of the men around them.

15:03.860 --> 15:09.540
It's this double standard that the whole body count conversation rests on. If male insecurity

15:09.540 --> 15:14.660
is self-defined and invalid, then all male activity as a result of the insecurity is a

15:14.660 --> 15:19.380
reason to shun the affected men until they smarten up, including them having any sort

15:19.380 --> 15:24.260
of sexual standard. If female insecurity is a result of being victimized by men,

15:24.260 --> 15:29.700
then all female activity as a result of the insecurity is justified, a self-defense mechanism

15:29.700 --> 15:34.260
to prevent further abuse, including them having any sort of sexual standard. In other words,

15:34.260 --> 15:38.500
women can have standards for men because women are victims. Men can't have standards for women

15:38.500 --> 15:43.140
because men are abusers. As a side note, go back and watch the super mega video I made with

15:43.140 --> 15:48.020
this understanding. Lex is an excellent example of what I'm talking about. Feminist women tend

15:48.020 --> 15:52.580
to excuse away all of their bad behavior as trauma responses, even if they actually haven't

15:52.580 --> 15:57.380
been traumatized, because I guess simply being a woman in 2023 is apparently traumatic enough.

15:57.380 --> 16:03.140
When the conversation becomes about body counts, that validates men's experiences and preferences,

16:03.140 --> 16:08.580
but it necessarily also must discredit the eternal trauma response narrative that feminist

16:08.580 --> 16:13.860
women employ. Even though feminism claims to be all about women's empowerment, when women become

16:13.860 --> 16:19.620
empowered agents responsible for their choices, including their sexual ones, and therefore it's

16:19.620 --> 16:24.340
not actually men's fault when men reject them, but women's fault because of the choices they made?

16:24.340 --> 16:26.260
Well, that's just something that they can't allow.
