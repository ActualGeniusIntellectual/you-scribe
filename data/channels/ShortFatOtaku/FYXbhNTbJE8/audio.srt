Dude, why is Sargon a part of every recent controversy? He was the center of the slop

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,840
gate thing from before, he's all over the starfield pronouns thing, and today's topic,

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,000
the body count discourse, yeah that was Sargon too. Here's a reddit post that went viral.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,440
I, 27 female, hate how men value me because of my body count. So I've been with 58 different

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,320
men which I know is higher than average but I wanted to have fun and enjoy new experiences

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,800
and it's my life so I did. But I've settled down the last year and have really been trying

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,820
to find someone special to settle down with and start a family. All my friends are now

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,360
either married or in relationships now and whenever I meet a match with a man or meet

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,020
one in real life and they always ask what my body count is and I tell them, they always

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,860
make a disgusted face and unmatch or ghost me. I even met one guy who I liked so much

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,760
and I thought he was so sweet who told me he wasn't interested in a woman with such

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,440
high mileage and ended up dumping me. I cried my eyes out for days over it. I'm more than

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,800
just the men I've slept with. I have a decent job, fun hobbies and interests and I'm still

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,480
young but I guess I'm just a hoe in most men's eyes.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,800
Sargon retweeted this story with a caption. The question we must ask young women is this.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,080
Who told you it was acceptable to have a high body count? That person has ruined your life

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,260
and dating prospects. You should be angry with them and ensure future generations of

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,780
women are not deceived by them as you were. And of course, this got everyone really mad.

19
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,120
How dare you say that a woman's past choices matter when it comes to her future attractability?

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,600
Of course, in the real world, a woman's past choices do matter when it comes to her future

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,640
attractability. But you know what? So do a man's. Not in exactly the same way, but it's

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,940
not like men are somehow untethered from the consequences of their actions. But this actually

23
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,460
was the first line of attack from progressives. One of the common replies was, what about

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,860
men's high body count? Sargon replied, since women use virgin as an insult towards men,

25
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,540
it seems that women find a man who hasn't penetrated another woman to be pathetic and

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,260
scornful. Men and women are totally different. Women view the number of women a man has slept

27
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,660
with as a measure of the value of that man. Now, this isn't exactly right. I know many,

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,020
many women who would not fuck a guy who's been with, say, 100 or 1000 girls. But this

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,260
is in the context of women using the words virgin or incel as insults. Here's the exchange

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,340
being replied to. This woman says, I was single for a decent amount of time in my 20s and

31
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,420
30s. I had fun. Make of that what you will. Now I'm in a relationship, which started when

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,420
I was 35, and we have a young daughter. We have a normal relationship, hard times and

33
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,220
great times. We share and often laugh about our prerelationship shenanigans with total

34
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,140
honesty about all the different things we experienced. A guy replies to her, that's

35
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,300
a funny way of saying you got ran through by Chad and Tyrone throughout your prime,

36
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,040
and then you finally settled down with a simp who was completely unaware and oblivious of

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,680
your whorish past when she became old, used up and blown out. Jesus. The woman replied

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
to that. Well, look at that. After all this time on Twitter, I finally found the incels.

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,960
Now I'm sure you know this, but incel means involuntary celibate. That means guys who

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,920
want to fuck but can't fuck because they can't find a partner. There's also an incel

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,400
community with guys who are honestly pretty sad and bitter about their lot in life. And

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
you know what? Fair enough. If you thought you were a zero out of 10, lowest of the low

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
male with no chance of ever getting a girl ever, that would probably be a pretty rough

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
existence. However, there is legitimate misogyny in these communities too. Pent up resentment

45
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,480
towards the women who find them ugly and the more successful men who actually find partners.

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,360
I talked about this in my incel video years ago. But basically, the incel community is

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,020
equal parts learned helplessness, legitimate helplessness, and legitimate hatred of women.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,000
A lot of these guys would actually end up a lot better off if they just finally got

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,820
laid, but some of them definitely wouldn't be. Which is why the incel community has gained

50
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,120
such a negative reputation online, and why the word incel is thrown around as an insult

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,160
so commonly by women who are being judged for their sexual experiences by these guys.

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,880
It's a way for them to sneakily judge their judges for their own lack of sexual experiences,

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,480
while hiding it behind the veil of talking about a hate group.

54
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,560
Here's what I mean. It was once very common for women to insult men by calling them virgins.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,120
The implication being, as Sargon said, women view the number of women that a man has slept

56
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,280
with as a measure of value of that man. If a man's body count is zero, he's a pathetic

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,680
failure and you can't attract women. I was certainly called a virgin by girls who hated

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,620
me back in high school. Even after I actually got laid, they still called me that, because

59
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,840
they know that guys tend to be sensitive about it, especially if it comes from a girl that's

60
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,800
out of their league. But as the world moved more progressive and sex positive, shaming

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,760
people for their sexual practices became unpopular. So, progressive women stopped saying virgin

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,240
and started saying incel instead, masking their attack as being related to an online

63
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,820
community with some pretty questionable beliefs. But more often than not, they're still referring

64
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,400
to a man's lack of sexual experience. In fact, I had the opportunity to talk to one

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,000
of the women attacking Sargon a little bit, a writer for the feminist rag Redux, and

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,400
here's how that went. She said, this is clearly fake and written by some incel who loves fantasying

67
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
about promiscuous women, aka women that sleep with other men and not them, being knocked

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,960
down a peg. I replied to her with, here you are using sexual history to shame men through

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,980
the use of the word incel, and you think it's bad to use sexual history to shame women?

70
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,760
She replied, what's wrong with incels isn't their sexual history, it's their attitudes

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,760
towards women. They're entitled, resentful, and misogynistic. Not all male virgins are

72
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,240
incels. Okay, fair enough, but I did find several instances of her using the word virgin

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,840
as an insult in the exact same way. It's not just incel subculture with you, you actually

74
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,620
shame people for being virgins. You shame men for their sexual history. You are entirely

75
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,520
guilty of this. You shame men for not having enough sexual experience, just as men shame

76
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,360
you for having too much sexual experience. She said, again, it was the misogynistic attitudes

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,000
towards the woman that was the problem. I replied to her, why do you default to talking

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,780
about their sexual activity as your go-to insult then, rather than the actual topic

79
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,140
at hand? Their attitudes. It sounds like sexual prowess is the only unit of value you understand,

80
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,000
which is why you insult men using it and get so offended when you're insulted with it.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,380
Yes, I was pulling the idea from that one meme that we've all seen. She basically

82
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,420
said, paraphrasing here, that when she insults men by calling them a virgin, it's due to

83
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,320
their lack of experience. That it's valid to point out when a man appears to not understand

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,840
the mechanics of sex, and that it's likely due to their lack of personal experience.

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,360
I replied, so let me get this straight, you're insulting men for not knowing anything about

86
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,180
sex by calling them virgins, and you're claiming that this isn't about shaming men

87
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,480
for their sexual history? She then said, yeah I know this is getting long, we're getting

88
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,920
to the end of it, where did I shame men in this tweet that we're talking about? It

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,340
seems like I'm insulting people who don't understand sexuality is based on biological

90
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,960
sex and not gender expression and saying they must not understand sex if they say that.

91
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,600
I asked, and how are you insulting them specifically? She replied, by saying they clearly don't

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,360
know what they're talking about. I then asked, using what terminology? Which is a

93
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,820
question she never answered. That was a bit long, but I went through the whole conversation

94
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,600
with you because I wanted to point out what happened with her, from a logic chain perspective.

95
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
Most of these people will simply block you long before the inconsistency in their argument

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
is laid bare like this, so I really wanted to see it through. She admits that she uses

97
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,160
virgin, and frankly probably in cell 2, to not only insult some men's bad attitudes

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,140
or bad behaviors or bad ideas about sex, but specifically to highlight that those bad attitudes

99
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,820
and behaviors and ideas stem from their lack of experience. Even in instances where there

100
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,020
isn't actually any bad attitudes, behaviors, or ideas, she still uses virgin as an insult

101
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,820
because the idea of somebody who is so uneducated about sex that they don't understand the basics

102
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,220
is humorous to her. In other words, she is judging men based on their lack of sexual

103
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,540
experience, by calling them virgins and incels. The same way that men judge women based on

104
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,820
their glut of sexual experience, by calling them whores and sluts.

105
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,460
I have no evidence for this claim. This is purely conjecture, based off my own intuition.

106
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,220
But I think, if you actually were able to follow the logic chain of most people who

107
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,860
use incel as an insult, and they didn't just block you right away for daring to question

108
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,820
them, you'd probably arrive back at this point eventually. Incels are bad because they

109
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,340
have bad ideas about sex and women. Those bad ideas stem from lack of experience. I

110
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,300
am making fun of them for their lack of experience, therefore I insult men for their sexual history

111
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,980
while complaining men insult me for mine.

112
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,100
Another claim that came out of the Sargon thread was that women can simply lie if they

113
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,300
think their partner cares about their sexual history. This is true. But there's two problems

114
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,540
with this. One, if you're willing to lie to your partner, you're a low quality human.

115
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,640
Your partner deserves better, you aren't good enough for him, and you're going to have

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,520
to routinely betray him as a part of the normal course of your relationship. Two, lies need

117
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,760
to be maintained, and either you're going to have to be an expert manipulator, or you're

118
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,420
eventually going to slip up and the truth will come out. It might take years, but for

119
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,660
most people, it will eventually happen. The number of people who can maintain a perfect

120
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,900
facade for decades is very low. That's why this isn't the own you think it is. You're

121
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,100
simply admitting you're a horrible person if you do this.

122
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Here's another issue with that Reddit post. Many people replying to Sargon said that the

123
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,140
post was fake. No woman would ever actually say, I've been with 58 men. And you know what?

124
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,400
Fair enough. Any woman that I know who's actually promiscuous, they tend not to keep track of

125
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,780
that exactly. She might say 60, she might say in the 50s or 60s somewhere, but to come

126
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,580
out and say strictly 58, that doesn't usually happen.

127
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,460
And this point gets me to the other side of the conversation. It is completely reasonable

128
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,700
to judge people based on their past sexual experiences, man or woman. There's this idea

129
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,620
among progressives of the atomized individual, the year zero moment zero blank slate every

130
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,080
man where nothing in the past matters and the future isn't guaranteed. So the only thing

131
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,760
relevant is this moment, which naturally leads to the idea that you shouldn't be judged for

132
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,460
your past behavior. That's in the past, man. Why are you bringing that up? The conservative

133
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,180
view is that we are our past. We are a continuum with our past selves and the present self

134
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,780
is the culmination of everything we've ever done. The progressive view taken to its extreme

135
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,740
leads to a lack of foresight and extreme self-indulgence. The conservative view taken to its extreme

136
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,640
leads to an inability to grow, being constantly chained to your old mistakes. The golden mean

137
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,740
therefore is understanding that you can change from past bad behaviors. They don't have to

138
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,740
define you forever, but it takes hard work and self-transformation. And that's something

139
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,780
you can't simply declare by fiat. Most men don't necessarily want a virginal wife or something,

140
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,140
but they tend to want women around the same level of sexual experience that they have. The idealized

141
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,300
first love is that you're both virgins and high school sweethearts or something. Most guys in

142
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,500
their 20s who have around five previous partners are going to be fine with a girl who also has

143
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,060
around five previous partners. There can be serious relationship problems if there's huge

144
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,580
disparities. It doesn't mean the relationship is doomed, but it does mean you have a lot of work

145
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,620
But most people are fine with someone who's more or less on their level. And since the average body

146
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,820
count for both men and women is somewhere in between four and eight, most people are going

147
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,380
to be fine. Now, I'm not saying that having standards is a bad thing. For example, if you're

148
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,700
a very religious person, you might want an equally religious partner. And that means you might

149
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,340
actually want that virgin wife or at least somebody with a low body count. But I don't think this

150
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,020
whole body count conversation applies to people like that. And here's why. One, if a girl's got

151
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,060
a high body count, you can generally figure it out without autistically asking about it on the

152
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,500
first date. Picture it in your head. You've got a religious guy going out to meet with a girl for

153
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,860
the first time. How she dresses, how she speaks, her interests, her history, they're all going to

154
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,540
be pointers towards what sort of personal life she has. Hell, how you were introduced to her is a

155
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,340
pointer. If you met the girl on Tinder and she shows up with a shaved side head and facial

156
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,860
piercings and talks about going to art school, the chances of her being a virgin is very low. Not

157
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,620
zero, of course. But I don't think you need to actually ask the body count question here. Two,

158
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,260
this goes back to the self-transformation thing, a truly religious person with religious morals

159
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,460
understands forgiveness. If you're a religious guy and you meet the blue sundress, Wojak GF,

160
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,900
and she tells you that yes, before she came to God, she was promiscuous and she asked for

161
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,060
forgiveness for it every day. And she's not simply lying to you, but she shows it in her actions and

162
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,700
how she behaves in church, how she behaves with her family and her community. I find it hard

163
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,300
to believe that a religious guy who truly followed that morality would reject her. I mean,

164
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,360
he still might, but Christianity is all about forgiving those who fall to temptation and a

165
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,820
true reformation goes a long way. This is ultimately the issue with a woman in this

166
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Reddit story, assuming it's a true story. The first thing is that she did what many men consider to

167
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,540
be unattractive. If you think that that's unfair or only incels care about her or whatever, too

168
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,500
bad. You can't shame people out of their sexual preferences. This is how it is and no amount of

169
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,780
dismantling the patriarchy will change it. But the real nail in the coffin is that she's

170
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,620
unrepentant. If you think there's nothing to repent for, then there isn't. Fine. There

171
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,540
absolutely are men out there who believe that a high body count isn't something to repent for,

172
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,980
and she can go for them. But for some reason, she's not. She's going for men who actually just

173
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,220
aren't compatible with her sexual history. To them, there is something to repent for,

174
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,100
and her unrepentance is just unattractive. Merrick, being a terminally online failed

175
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,060
crumbtuber, chimed in by saying that the story must be fake because men never ask about the body

176
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,380
count question, and that those who do are losers. They're not worthy of a woman's time. Except in

177
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,940
this story, again assuming it's true, the woman seems quite put out by being rejected by these

178
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,780
apparent losers who shouldn't be worth her time. I simply replied to her with,

179
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,620
I'm still not going to date a woman with a considerably higher body count than me,

180
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,780
as it's a sign that we have different moral tastes. I found a girl I match with nicely.

181
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,060
I don't need to settle. And that's what's at the heart of the conversation.

182
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,460
Unlike other people, I'm not going to judge women who sleep around and rack up a huge body count.

183
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,020
I don't care. I don't hate you like some incels might. I just won't date you. You do you,

184
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:08,100
and I'll do me. This is a moral conversation, and morals are at their heart a part of your intuition.

185
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,900
One person replied to me asking, I'm curious what moral tastes you input on your perception

186
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,300
of somebody's character because of their body count. I replied, if you value chastity,

187
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,180
then not being chaste is inherently of poor moral character. If you don't value chastity,

188
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,140
then it's not. She then asked me, do you have a logical reason to value chastity, or is it just

189
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,820
vague personal interpretations or feelings? The issue is, that is what morality is. When

190
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,900
something appears to be good or evil to you, it's because it feels good or evil.

191
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,060
Even if you're a consequentialist performing some sort of calculation to get to your desired end,

192
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,300
what you desire as the end is ultimately going to come down to personal taste.

193
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,700
Some people don't care if their partner has a massive sexual history. Other people do care

194
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,620
quite a bit. Neither option is objectively correct. It's all a matter of personal taste.

195
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,380
And your personal taste is not something you should tolerate being shamed for.

196
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,540
That's what's at the bottom of this conversation. When women have too many sexual partners,

197
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,780
some men find them unattractive as a result. Not all of them, of course, but enough that it's

198
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,420
an identifiable trend. The problem, though, is the double standard. That feminist women bristle

199
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,900
at the idea of being held up to their man's standard, while they hold men up to their

200
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,780
standard. On the other side, the more red pill types of men do this too. They hold women up to

201
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,020
the standard of chastity and virtue while they themselves sleep around. It's the same problem,

202
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,420
but the double standard is still at play. Both of these groups, the feminist women and the

203
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,620
red pill men, will call their targets insecure. Those slutty women are just insecure. Those incel

204
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,380
dudes are just insecure. But our society treats male and female insecurity very differently.

205
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,180
If a man is called insecure, it's generally meant to be derogatory, like it's his fault he can't

206
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,820
shore up his own mental state. If a woman is called insecure, she's cast as a victim, like,

207
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,380
oh, she's traumatized or something. Even if both of these people were cheated on, the woman's a

208
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,300
victim, the man needs to get a grip. Our society views male insecurities as inherently unjustified,

209
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,860
stemming from a personal fault, while women's insecurities are the fault of the men around them.

210
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,540
It's this double standard that the whole body count conversation rests on. If male insecurity

211
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,660
is self-defined and invalid, then all male activity as a result of the insecurity is a

212
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,380
reason to shun the affected men until they smarten up, including them having any sort

213
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,260
of sexual standard. If female insecurity is a result of being victimized by men,

214
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,700
then all female activity as a result of the insecurity is justified, a self-defense mechanism

215
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,260
to prevent further abuse, including them having any sort of sexual standard. In other words,

216
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,500
women can have standards for men because women are victims. Men can't have standards for women

217
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,140
because men are abusers. As a side note, go back and watch the super mega video I made with

218
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,020
this understanding. Lex is an excellent example of what I'm talking about. Feminist women tend

219
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,580
to excuse away all of their bad behavior as trauma responses, even if they actually haven't

220
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,380
been traumatized, because I guess simply being a woman in 2023 is apparently traumatic enough.

221
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,140
When the conversation becomes about body counts, that validates men's experiences and preferences,

222
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,580
but it necessarily also must discredit the eternal trauma response narrative that feminist

223
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,860
women employ. Even though feminism claims to be all about women's empowerment, when women become

224
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,620
empowered agents responsible for their choices, including their sexual ones, and therefore it's

225
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,340
not actually men's fault when men reject them, but women's fault because of the choices they made?

226
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,260
Well, that's just something that they can't allow.
