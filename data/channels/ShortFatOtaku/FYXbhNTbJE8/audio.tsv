0	10400	Dude, why is Sargon a part of every recent controversy? He was the center of the slop
10400	14840	gate thing from before, he's all over the starfield pronouns thing, and today's topic,
14840	20000	the body count discourse, yeah that was Sargon too. Here's a reddit post that went viral.
20000	26440	I, 27 female, hate how men value me because of my body count. So I've been with 58 different
26440	31320	men which I know is higher than average but I wanted to have fun and enjoy new experiences
31320	35800	and it's my life so I did. But I've settled down the last year and have really been trying
35800	39820	to find someone special to settle down with and start a family. All my friends are now
39820	44360	either married or in relationships now and whenever I meet a match with a man or meet
44360	48020	one in real life and they always ask what my body count is and I tell them, they always
48020	52860	make a disgusted face and unmatch or ghost me. I even met one guy who I liked so much
52860	56760	and I thought he was so sweet who told me he wasn't interested in a woman with such
56760	62440	high mileage and ended up dumping me. I cried my eyes out for days over it. I'm more than
62440	66800	just the men I've slept with. I have a decent job, fun hobbies and interests and I'm still
66800	70480	young but I guess I'm just a hoe in most men's eyes.
70480	74800	Sargon retweeted this story with a caption. The question we must ask young women is this.
74800	79080	Who told you it was acceptable to have a high body count? That person has ruined your life
79080	83260	and dating prospects. You should be angry with them and ensure future generations of
83260	87780	women are not deceived by them as you were. And of course, this got everyone really mad.
87780	92120	How dare you say that a woman's past choices matter when it comes to her future attractability?
92120	95600	Of course, in the real world, a woman's past choices do matter when it comes to her future
95600	99640	attractability. But you know what? So do a man's. Not in exactly the same way, but it's
99640	103940	not like men are somehow untethered from the consequences of their actions. But this actually
103940	108460	was the first line of attack from progressives. One of the common replies was, what about
108460	113860	men's high body count? Sargon replied, since women use virgin as an insult towards men,
113860	117540	it seems that women find a man who hasn't penetrated another woman to be pathetic and
117540	122260	scornful. Men and women are totally different. Women view the number of women a man has slept
122260	127660	with as a measure of the value of that man. Now, this isn't exactly right. I know many,
127660	133020	many women who would not fuck a guy who's been with, say, 100 or 1000 girls. But this
133020	138260	is in the context of women using the words virgin or incel as insults. Here's the exchange
138300	142340	being replied to. This woman says, I was single for a decent amount of time in my 20s and
142340	146420	30s. I had fun. Make of that what you will. Now I'm in a relationship, which started when
146420	150420	I was 35, and we have a young daughter. We have a normal relationship, hard times and
150420	155220	great times. We share and often laugh about our prerelationship shenanigans with total
155220	159140	honesty about all the different things we experienced. A guy replies to her, that's
159140	163300	a funny way of saying you got ran through by Chad and Tyrone throughout your prime,
163300	167040	and then you finally settled down with a simp who was completely unaware and oblivious of
167040	171680	your whorish past when she became old, used up and blown out. Jesus. The woman replied
171680	175920	to that. Well, look at that. After all this time on Twitter, I finally found the incels.
175920	179960	Now I'm sure you know this, but incel means involuntary celibate. That means guys who
179960	183920	want to fuck but can't fuck because they can't find a partner. There's also an incel
183920	188400	community with guys who are honestly pretty sad and bitter about their lot in life. And
188400	191840	you know what? Fair enough. If you thought you were a zero out of 10, lowest of the low
191840	195840	male with no chance of ever getting a girl ever, that would probably be a pretty rough
195840	200640	existence. However, there is legitimate misogyny in these communities too. Pent up resentment
200640	204480	towards the women who find them ugly and the more successful men who actually find partners.
204480	208360	I talked about this in my incel video years ago. But basically, the incel community is
208360	213020	equal parts learned helplessness, legitimate helplessness, and legitimate hatred of women.
213020	217000	A lot of these guys would actually end up a lot better off if they just finally got
217000	220820	laid, but some of them definitely wouldn't be. Which is why the incel community has gained
220820	225120	such a negative reputation online, and why the word incel is thrown around as an insult
225120	230160	so commonly by women who are being judged for their sexual experiences by these guys.
230160	234880	It's a way for them to sneakily judge their judges for their own lack of sexual experiences,
234880	237480	while hiding it behind the veil of talking about a hate group.
237480	241560	Here's what I mean. It was once very common for women to insult men by calling them virgins.
241560	245120	The implication being, as Sargon said, women view the number of women that a man has slept
245120	249280	with as a measure of value of that man. If a man's body count is zero, he's a pathetic
249280	252680	failure and you can't attract women. I was certainly called a virgin by girls who hated
252680	256620	me back in high school. Even after I actually got laid, they still called me that, because
256620	259840	they know that guys tend to be sensitive about it, especially if it comes from a girl that's
259840	263800	out of their league. But as the world moved more progressive and sex positive, shaming
263800	268760	people for their sexual practices became unpopular. So, progressive women stopped saying virgin
268760	273240	and started saying incel instead, masking their attack as being related to an online
273240	277820	community with some pretty questionable beliefs. But more often than not, they're still referring
277820	281400	to a man's lack of sexual experience. In fact, I had the opportunity to talk to one
281400	285000	of the women attacking Sargon a little bit, a writer for the feminist rag Redux, and
285000	290400	here's how that went. She said, this is clearly fake and written by some incel who loves fantasying
290400	294000	about promiscuous women, aka women that sleep with other men and not them, being knocked
294000	298960	down a peg. I replied to her with, here you are using sexual history to shame men through
298960	302980	the use of the word incel, and you think it's bad to use sexual history to shame women?
302980	306760	She replied, what's wrong with incels isn't their sexual history, it's their attitudes
306760	310760	towards women. They're entitled, resentful, and misogynistic. Not all male virgins are
310760	316240	incels. Okay, fair enough, but I did find several instances of her using the word virgin
316240	320840	as an insult in the exact same way. It's not just incel subculture with you, you actually
320840	325620	shame people for being virgins. You shame men for their sexual history. You are entirely
325620	330520	guilty of this. You shame men for not having enough sexual experience, just as men shame
330520	335360	you for having too much sexual experience. She said, again, it was the misogynistic attitudes
335360	339000	towards the woman that was the problem. I replied to her, why do you default to talking
339000	342780	about their sexual activity as your go-to insult then, rather than the actual topic
342780	348140	at hand? Their attitudes. It sounds like sexual prowess is the only unit of value you understand,
348140	352000	which is why you insult men using it and get so offended when you're insulted with it.
352000	355380	Yes, I was pulling the idea from that one meme that we've all seen. She basically
355380	359420	said, paraphrasing here, that when she insults men by calling them a virgin, it's due to
359420	363320	their lack of experience. That it's valid to point out when a man appears to not understand
363320	366840	the mechanics of sex, and that it's likely due to their lack of personal experience.
366840	370360	I replied, so let me get this straight, you're insulting men for not knowing anything about
370360	374180	sex by calling them virgins, and you're claiming that this isn't about shaming men
374180	377480	for their sexual history? She then said, yeah I know this is getting long, we're getting
377480	380920	to the end of it, where did I shame men in this tweet that we're talking about? It
380920	385340	seems like I'm insulting people who don't understand sexuality is based on biological
385340	389960	sex and not gender expression and saying they must not understand sex if they say that.
389960	394600	I asked, and how are you insulting them specifically? She replied, by saying they clearly don't
394600	398360	know what they're talking about. I then asked, using what terminology? Which is a
398360	401820	question she never answered. That was a bit long, but I went through the whole conversation
401820	405600	with you because I wanted to point out what happened with her, from a logic chain perspective.
405600	408720	Most of these people will simply block you long before the inconsistency in their argument
408720	412560	is laid bare like this, so I really wanted to see it through. She admits that she uses
412560	417160	virgin, and frankly probably in cell 2, to not only insult some men's bad attitudes
417160	422140	or bad behaviors or bad ideas about sex, but specifically to highlight that those bad attitudes
422140	426820	and behaviors and ideas stem from their lack of experience. Even in instances where there
426820	432020	isn't actually any bad attitudes, behaviors, or ideas, she still uses virgin as an insult
432020	436820	because the idea of somebody who is so uneducated about sex that they don't understand the basics
436820	441220	is humorous to her. In other words, she is judging men based on their lack of sexual
441220	445540	experience, by calling them virgins and incels. The same way that men judge women based on
445540	448820	their glut of sexual experience, by calling them whores and sluts.
448820	452460	I have no evidence for this claim. This is purely conjecture, based off my own intuition.
452460	456220	But I think, if you actually were able to follow the logic chain of most people who
456220	459860	use incel as an insult, and they didn't just block you right away for daring to question
459860	463820	them, you'd probably arrive back at this point eventually. Incels are bad because they
463820	468340	have bad ideas about sex and women. Those bad ideas stem from lack of experience. I
468340	473300	am making fun of them for their lack of experience, therefore I insult men for their sexual history
473300	475980	while complaining men insult me for mine.
475980	479100	Another claim that came out of the Sargon thread was that women can simply lie if they
479100	483300	think their partner cares about their sexual history. This is true. But there's two problems
483300	487540	with this. One, if you're willing to lie to your partner, you're a low quality human.
487540	490640	Your partner deserves better, you aren't good enough for him, and you're going to have
490640	495520	to routinely betray him as a part of the normal course of your relationship. Two, lies need
495520	498760	to be maintained, and either you're going to have to be an expert manipulator, or you're
498760	502420	eventually going to slip up and the truth will come out. It might take years, but for
502420	506660	most people, it will eventually happen. The number of people who can maintain a perfect
506660	511900	facade for decades is very low. That's why this isn't the own you think it is. You're
511900	515100	simply admitting you're a horrible person if you do this.
515100	518500	Here's another issue with that Reddit post. Many people replying to Sargon said that the
518500	523140	post was fake. No woman would ever actually say, I've been with 58 men. And you know what?
523140	527400	Fair enough. Any woman that I know who's actually promiscuous, they tend not to keep track of
527400	531780	that exactly. She might say 60, she might say in the 50s or 60s somewhere, but to come
531780	534580	out and say strictly 58, that doesn't usually happen.
534580	538460	And this point gets me to the other side of the conversation. It is completely reasonable
538460	542700	to judge people based on their past sexual experiences, man or woman. There's this idea
542700	547620	among progressives of the atomized individual, the year zero moment zero blank slate every
547620	551080	man where nothing in the past matters and the future isn't guaranteed. So the only thing
551080	554760	relevant is this moment, which naturally leads to the idea that you shouldn't be judged for
554760	558460	your past behavior. That's in the past, man. Why are you bringing that up? The conservative
558460	563180	view is that we are our past. We are a continuum with our past selves and the present self
563180	566780	is the culmination of everything we've ever done. The progressive view taken to its extreme
566780	571740	leads to a lack of foresight and extreme self-indulgence. The conservative view taken to its extreme
571740	576640	leads to an inability to grow, being constantly chained to your old mistakes. The golden mean
576640	580740	therefore is understanding that you can change from past bad behaviors. They don't have to
580740	584740	define you forever, but it takes hard work and self-transformation. And that's something
584740	589780	you can't simply declare by fiat. Most men don't necessarily want a virginal wife or something,
589780	594140	but they tend to want women around the same level of sexual experience that they have. The idealized
594140	598300	first love is that you're both virgins and high school sweethearts or something. Most guys in
598300	602500	their 20s who have around five previous partners are going to be fine with a girl who also has
602500	607060	around five previous partners. There can be serious relationship problems if there's huge
607060	610580	disparities. It doesn't mean the relationship is doomed, but it does mean you have a lot of work
611260	616620	But most people are fine with someone who's more or less on their level. And since the average body
616620	620820	count for both men and women is somewhere in between four and eight, most people are going
620820	625380	to be fine. Now, I'm not saying that having standards is a bad thing. For example, if you're
625380	629700	a very religious person, you might want an equally religious partner. And that means you might
629700	634340	actually want that virgin wife or at least somebody with a low body count. But I don't think this
634340	639020	whole body count conversation applies to people like that. And here's why. One, if a girl's got
639060	643060	a high body count, you can generally figure it out without autistically asking about it on the
643060	646500	first date. Picture it in your head. You've got a religious guy going out to meet with a girl for
646500	650860	the first time. How she dresses, how she speaks, her interests, her history, they're all going to
650860	655540	be pointers towards what sort of personal life she has. Hell, how you were introduced to her is a
655540	660340	pointer. If you met the girl on Tinder and she shows up with a shaved side head and facial
660340	664860	piercings and talks about going to art school, the chances of her being a virgin is very low. Not
664940	669620	zero, of course. But I don't think you need to actually ask the body count question here. Two,
669620	674260	this goes back to the self-transformation thing, a truly religious person with religious morals
674260	679460	understands forgiveness. If you're a religious guy and you meet the blue sundress, Wojak GF,
679460	683900	and she tells you that yes, before she came to God, she was promiscuous and she asked for
683900	688060	forgiveness for it every day. And she's not simply lying to you, but she shows it in her actions and
688060	691700	how she behaves in church, how she behaves with her family and her community. I find it hard
691940	696300	to believe that a religious guy who truly followed that morality would reject her. I mean,
696300	700360	he still might, but Christianity is all about forgiving those who fall to temptation and a
700360	704820	true reformation goes a long way. This is ultimately the issue with a woman in this
704820	708820	Reddit story, assuming it's a true story. The first thing is that she did what many men consider to
708820	713540	be unattractive. If you think that that's unfair or only incels care about her or whatever, too
713540	718500	bad. You can't shame people out of their sexual preferences. This is how it is and no amount of
718500	722780	dismantling the patriarchy will change it. But the real nail in the coffin is that she's
722780	726620	unrepentant. If you think there's nothing to repent for, then there isn't. Fine. There
726620	730540	absolutely are men out there who believe that a high body count isn't something to repent for,
730540	734980	and she can go for them. But for some reason, she's not. She's going for men who actually just
734980	739220	aren't compatible with her sexual history. To them, there is something to repent for,
739220	744100	and her unrepentance is just unattractive. Merrick, being a terminally online failed
744100	749060	crumbtuber, chimed in by saying that the story must be fake because men never ask about the body
749060	753380	count question, and that those who do are losers. They're not worthy of a woman's time. Except in
753380	757940	this story, again assuming it's true, the woman seems quite put out by being rejected by these
757940	761780	apparent losers who shouldn't be worth her time. I simply replied to her with,
761780	765620	I'm still not going to date a woman with a considerably higher body count than me,
765620	769780	as it's a sign that we have different moral tastes. I found a girl I match with nicely.
769780	773060	I don't need to settle. And that's what's at the heart of the conversation.
773060	777460	Unlike other people, I'm not going to judge women who sleep around and rack up a huge body count.
777460	782020	I don't care. I don't hate you like some incels might. I just won't date you. You do you,
782020	788100	and I'll do me. This is a moral conversation, and morals are at their heart a part of your intuition.
788100	792900	One person replied to me asking, I'm curious what moral tastes you input on your perception
792900	797300	of somebody's character because of their body count. I replied, if you value chastity,
797300	802180	then not being chaste is inherently of poor moral character. If you don't value chastity,
802180	807140	then it's not. She then asked me, do you have a logical reason to value chastity, or is it just
807140	812820	vague personal interpretations or feelings? The issue is, that is what morality is. When
812820	816900	something appears to be good or evil to you, it's because it feels good or evil.
816900	821060	Even if you're a consequentialist performing some sort of calculation to get to your desired end,
821060	825300	what you desire as the end is ultimately going to come down to personal taste.
825300	829700	Some people don't care if their partner has a massive sexual history. Other people do care
829700	833620	quite a bit. Neither option is objectively correct. It's all a matter of personal taste.
833620	837380	And your personal taste is not something you should tolerate being shamed for.
837380	841540	That's what's at the bottom of this conversation. When women have too many sexual partners,
841540	845780	some men find them unattractive as a result. Not all of them, of course, but enough that it's
845780	850420	an identifiable trend. The problem, though, is the double standard. That feminist women bristle
850420	854900	at the idea of being held up to their man's standard, while they hold men up to their
854900	859780	standard. On the other side, the more red pill types of men do this too. They hold women up to
859780	864020	the standard of chastity and virtue while they themselves sleep around. It's the same problem,
864020	868420	but the double standard is still at play. Both of these groups, the feminist women and the
868420	873620	red pill men, will call their targets insecure. Those slutty women are just insecure. Those incel
873620	879380	dudes are just insecure. But our society treats male and female insecurity very differently.
879380	884180	If a man is called insecure, it's generally meant to be derogatory, like it's his fault he can't
884180	888820	shore up his own mental state. If a woman is called insecure, she's cast as a victim, like,
888820	893380	oh, she's traumatized or something. Even if both of these people were cheated on, the woman's a
893380	899300	victim, the man needs to get a grip. Our society views male insecurities as inherently unjustified,
899300	903860	stemming from a personal fault, while women's insecurities are the fault of the men around them.
903860	909540	It's this double standard that the whole body count conversation rests on. If male insecurity
909540	914660	is self-defined and invalid, then all male activity as a result of the insecurity is a
914660	919380	reason to shun the affected men until they smarten up, including them having any sort
919380	924260	of sexual standard. If female insecurity is a result of being victimized by men,
924260	929700	then all female activity as a result of the insecurity is justified, a self-defense mechanism
929700	934260	to prevent further abuse, including them having any sort of sexual standard. In other words,
934260	938500	women can have standards for men because women are victims. Men can't have standards for women
938500	943140	because men are abusers. As a side note, go back and watch the super mega video I made with
943140	948020	this understanding. Lex is an excellent example of what I'm talking about. Feminist women tend
948020	952580	to excuse away all of their bad behavior as trauma responses, even if they actually haven't
952580	957380	been traumatized, because I guess simply being a woman in 2023 is apparently traumatic enough.
957380	963140	When the conversation becomes about body counts, that validates men's experiences and preferences,
963140	968580	but it necessarily also must discredit the eternal trauma response narrative that feminist
