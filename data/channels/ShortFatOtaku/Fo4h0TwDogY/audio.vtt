Hello my friends, welcome to the Weekly Sip. Today I've got some hazelnut coffee.

00:10.560 --> 00:15.920
I've realized I have a number of really large video projects, not like the 10 minute or less

00:15.920 --> 00:21.120
ones that I've been doing recently, but a number of really long projects that are about half done

00:21.120 --> 00:26.640
and that I have to get going on, like, you know, KickVic or the Balsanaro video. So this time

00:26.640 --> 00:31.360
around I'm going to zip through the Weekly Sip as quick as I can. It'll be a smaller one,

00:31.360 --> 00:35.120
so I can get back to work on those projects. I want to get them out sometime this week,

00:35.120 --> 00:41.120
hopefully. Let's begin with this article on The Star. The Star is a Canadian paper. It's Canada's

00:41.120 --> 00:46.480
duty to repatriate the brides of Daesh. Daesh is ISIS, by the way. Now those of you who watched

00:46.480 --> 00:53.280
my video called The Brides of ISIS, this article came out literally hours later after I put that

00:53.280 --> 00:59.440
video out, and I kind of wish I had waited on it because holy shit, this is a ridiculous article.

00:59.440 --> 01:06.240
Jihadi brides and caliphate cubs with the men dead imprisoned on the lam. Their wives and children

01:06.240 --> 01:12.720
are coming home to roost. No they're not. No they're not. Idiotic girls, teenagers mostly,

01:12.720 --> 01:18.320
who pack themselves off to Syria and Northern Iraq, slipping away from families, willingly

01:18.320 --> 01:24.640
giving up passports, sometimes taking up arms, often gleefully pumping out propaganda against

01:24.640 --> 01:30.400
the nations of their birth, urging others to join them. Breeding, because that, it turned out,

01:30.400 --> 01:36.160
was their primary value to ISIS. To populate the nascent state as housewives and mothers,

01:36.160 --> 01:42.320
brood mares for the next generation of Islamist zealots. Yeah, that's why they can't come back.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.280
They did all of those terrible things. But there's nothing left of the caliphate

01:47.280 --> 01:52.080
except for an ideology. Well, the ideology is the most important part, isn't it? The ideology

01:52.080 --> 01:57.280
is what will allow the caliphate to someday reappear. It's not something that's insignificant,

01:57.280 --> 02:03.520
as you seem to say here. It's in fact the most important part. It's why the fighting can't stop.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.320
At least three of those women, identified by name in media reports, are Canadians,

02:08.320 --> 02:12.880
as would be their offspring regardless of the father's nationality. I'm not sure if that's the

02:12.880 --> 02:17.520
case under Canadian law. It might be. I know that Canada definitely has birthright citizenship,

02:17.520 --> 02:23.280
so it's definitely possible that those kids are Canadian. They are subsisting those woe-begone

02:23.280 --> 02:29.040
dregs of the caliphate in tents without heat, with little food and scarce medical supplies.

02:29.040 --> 02:34.080
The children are dying by the week. Many others didn't survive the exodus. They're not to blame.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.600
When they say, uh, they're not to blame, if they're referring to the children, that's actually

02:39.600 --> 02:43.440
true. You know, the kids are not to blame. They're not to blame for the actions of their parents.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.760
However, if they mean the women aren't to blame, yes they are. The women aren't children. I know

02:49.760 --> 02:52.720
they like to pair women and children a lot together, but the women aren't children.

02:53.280 --> 02:58.800
They are adults. They have fully developed brains. They make their own choices, and they

02:58.800 --> 03:03.200
have to deal with the consequences of their actions. Yet Ottawa has no plan to repatriate

03:03.200 --> 03:08.480
these innocent victims, hasn't even offered counselor services to their mothers. Well,

03:08.480 --> 03:15.840
you know what? It sucks. But one, the women aren't innocent victims. Two, even if the children are

03:15.840 --> 03:22.000
innocent victims, their mothers aren't. And if we're keeping the kids with the mothers, then the

03:22.000 --> 03:25.920
kids have to stay with the mothers, which is not in Canada. Like, look at this, look at this. Here's

03:25.920 --> 03:31.280
that woman that I mentioned in the previous video, Kimberly Gwen Polman. She says, I don't have the

03:31.280 --> 03:36.000
words for how much regret I have, and that she was thrown in jail and raped when she tried to flee

03:36.000 --> 03:42.080
ISIS. Yet the brutal crimes of ISIS beheading journalists, mass rape of Yazidi minority women,

03:42.080 --> 03:46.720
were well documented by the time Polman crossed the border into the Islamic State. She was already

03:46.720 --> 03:51.520
the mother of three grown children, not a naive ISIS fangirl. I'm not interested in bloodshed,

03:51.520 --> 03:56.880
and I don't know what to believe. These are videos on YouTube. What's real? What's not real?

03:56.880 --> 04:03.280
You're an idiot. Like, that's it. It's true. You're not a naive ISIS fangirl. You're not some

04:03.280 --> 04:08.480
teenager who makes a big mistake, destroys their life, and goes across the border. You're 46 and

04:08.480 --> 04:13.760
you did this. You're an idiot. And that's it. There's nothing else to say about it.

04:13.760 --> 04:19.520
Abdul Karim Omar, de facto foreign minister in the Kurdish-held north, said he and the Syrian

04:19.520 --> 04:25.440
democratic forces have more than done their part. Over to you, Western nations. Noting that at least

04:25.440 --> 04:30.400
six British jihadis are being held in prison, including two members of the notorious Beatles

04:30.400 --> 04:34.800
gang accused of beheading Western hostages. Omar warned that the imprisoned men were likely to

04:34.800 --> 04:40.240
escape or be set free in the anticipated combat to come. So his logic is that Western nations should

04:40.240 --> 04:47.280
take these people back, because if they don't, the area, as he says, is not stable politically

04:47.280 --> 04:52.400
or militarily. And during the fighting, those people will be set free and they'll run off into

04:52.400 --> 04:56.480
the wild and then they may end up re-radicalizing or something. And that's certainly possible.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.680
If Canada takes anybody, it should take them to put them in jail and put them in jail for the

05:01.680 --> 05:06.080
rest of their lives. And he's right here. If there's war and attacks, those fighters and

05:06.080 --> 05:10.720
their wives will come back to Britain and be terrorists. That's true. That's what they'll do.

05:10.720 --> 05:15.920
We basically have two choices here and the choices suck. We can allow them back in and then

05:15.920 --> 05:21.760
immediately throw them in prison. Or we can ignore them and then they'll come back as sleeper cells.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.560
And that's it. Of course, there's the third option, which is completely ridiculous,

05:26.560 --> 05:30.640
which is just allow them back in to just resettle in Canada. And it's like, okay,

05:30.640 --> 05:34.480
yeah, just come back in. You didn't do anything wrong. It's fine. You're just a citizen. That

05:34.480 --> 05:39.520
would be disastrous. The article goes over a lot of the stuff that I brought up in my previous

05:39.520 --> 05:44.160
video. Let's check out the ending here. Apart from the firmly unrepentant, it's what they all claim,

05:44.160 --> 05:49.280
the ISIS camp followers who now want to come home, but their misadventure is behind them.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.720
Some of them readily acknowledging they should be tried and sent to prison,

05:52.720 --> 05:57.200
although it's unclear for what offenses. Perhaps material support to a terrorist organization.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.040
Perhaps treason. You know, I'm not somebody who likes to throw around the charge of treason

06:03.040 --> 06:07.840
lately because it sounds like a ridiculous charge in the modern age, doesn't it? There should be no

06:07.840 --> 06:13.600
compulsion for blind loyalty to your home country, especially in the face of your home country being

06:14.560 --> 06:21.120
somehow corrupt or committing some kind of terrible immoral acts. You don't have to be

06:21.120 --> 06:25.520
loyal to a place just because you were born there. And the charge of treason implies that you do.

06:25.520 --> 06:30.240
However, this is about as black and white of a case as we could probably get, at least in

06:30.240 --> 06:36.080
the modern world. Western countries for all of their faults are still the best places to live

06:36.080 --> 06:40.800
for a reason. And if you actually want to qualify ISIS as an official country,

06:40.800 --> 06:45.040
it was probably the worst country on the planet during the years that it existed.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.120
Professing their ignorance, these women portray themselves as no more responsible for their poor

06:49.120 --> 06:54.880
judgment than the children they've born. Yeah, that's because they recognize that that bundle

06:54.880 --> 07:00.240
in their arms is actually innocent and they want to latch themselves to it and try to come back.

07:00.240 --> 07:06.480
As repugnant as they may be, they can't be left to rot in war and refugee camps. Certainly their

07:06.480 --> 07:11.120
children are victims deserving of deliverance and children shouldn't be separated from their

07:11.120 --> 07:14.720
mothers. No, no, no, no, no. In this case, children should be separated from their mothers.

07:15.360 --> 07:21.920
There are many cases where a mother does not deserve to have her children. Many cases. We

07:21.920 --> 07:27.440
do this all the time as a society. We find unfit mothers and unfit fathers and we take their kids

07:27.440 --> 07:33.760
from them. And if we are allowing these jihadi children back into Canada, and I think we should,

07:33.760 --> 07:38.160
their mothers can't come with them. And that's that. That's that. They can't come.

07:38.160 --> 07:42.640
If they come to Canada, they go to prison. That's how it has to be. However, I'm sure there's at

07:42.640 --> 07:47.040
least a few SJWs out there who would say that I'm being too logical and not emotional enough.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.360
So let's cover that article now. The magical thinking of guys who love logic.

07:54.240 --> 08:01.120
Why so many men online love to use logic in scare quotes to win an argument and then disappear

08:01.120 --> 08:04.880
before they can find out they're wrong. The thing about logic, it's not necessarily infallible.

08:05.920 --> 08:10.480
Logic can change just the way that science can change. You discover new facts and then

08:10.480 --> 08:14.400
your opinion changes. That makes sense. But at the very least, if you're being logical,

08:15.200 --> 08:21.440
I think it's safe to say that you're using some kind of tool set in a pursuit of an objective

08:21.440 --> 08:26.080
truth, which is certainly something that you can't say for people who use emotion as their guide

08:26.080 --> 08:31.680
post. Ian Danskin, who makes videos under the moniker Innuendo Studios, has made a name for

08:31.680 --> 08:35.680
himself on the internet for his YouTube series on the techniques and beliefs of the alt-right.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.120
His most recent video, The Card Says Moops, is worth watching in full, but there was one

08:41.120 --> 08:45.680
particular line in it that struck me. Danskin points out that even when their beliefs skew

08:45.680 --> 08:52.000
towards the bizarre and conspiratorial, people on the online right often identify as rationalists.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.920
Well, first of all, I mean, there's a few problems here. One, logic and reason are the same thing.

08:59.360 --> 09:05.280
They're actually opposing values, believe it or not. Logic is meant to be significantly more

09:05.280 --> 09:10.480
objective than reason. Reasoning is often subjective, and it's meant to be subjective.

09:10.480 --> 09:16.080
It's meant to be like your own personal logic, in a sense. Logic is about tangible proof,

09:16.640 --> 09:22.560
while reasoning is the capacity to make sense of stimulus. They're not the same thing. And bringing

09:22.560 --> 09:29.360
up the term rationalists invokes the art of reasoning more than it does logic. This will

09:29.360 --> 09:34.560
be unsurprising to those who often engage with the wider online right, whether it is with someone who

09:34.560 --> 09:41.360
identifies as alt-right, libertarian, conservative, as a fan of the intellectual dark web, or even

09:41.360 --> 09:48.400
moderate or centrist. So hear me out here. Is this how the left is identifying this now,

09:48.400 --> 09:54.720
the far left? The online right is somebody who's alt-right, libertarian, conservative,

09:55.520 --> 10:02.080
in the intellectual dark web, moderate or centrist. That's the right now, is everything

10:02.080 --> 10:10.560
that's not left. People talk about the overtime window. People talk about how centrist figures,

10:10.560 --> 10:15.600
like Sargon or even Dankula seems a little bit centrist. They're getting labeled as alt-right

10:15.600 --> 10:20.000
or far-right or right-adjacent or whatever the fuck. I've been labeled as alt-right,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.880
even though I'm definitely a center-lefty. There's been this conspiracy that the far left views

10:24.880 --> 10:31.120
anything that is not the far left as the right, and I guess this paragraph confirms it. Although

10:31.120 --> 10:35.680
their beliefs may not be identical, there are common distinct patterns in the way they speak

10:35.680 --> 10:41.440
or type that one can't help but notice. So it's not even about the substance of their arguments,

10:41.440 --> 10:46.080
it's about how they present themselves. That's what makes you alt-right now. You can believe

10:46.080 --> 10:51.760
the exact same thing that somebody on the far left believes, but if you don't march in lockstep with

10:51.760 --> 10:57.440
them, you're part of the right. Specifically, these guys, and they are usually guys, love

10:57.440 --> 11:02.160
using terms like logic. They will tell you over and over how they love to use logic,

11:02.720 --> 11:08.000
and how the people they follow online also use logic. They are also massive fans of

11:08.000 --> 11:13.200
declaring that they have facts, that their analysis is unbiased, that they use reason

11:13.200 --> 11:20.720
and logic and not emotions to make decisions. Well, is that the case? I mean, there are

11:20.720 --> 11:25.360
definitely people out there who say, I'm using logic, and they're obviously not using logic, or

11:25.360 --> 11:29.120
I'm reasonable, and they're obviously not being reasonable. Like, that happens. It happens

11:29.120 --> 11:34.640
everywhere. But these people that you're talking about, are they actually logical?

11:34.640 --> 11:39.920
Do they actually have the facts? I mean, doesn't that matter more than how they're coming across

11:39.920 --> 11:44.640
to you personally? These words are usually used interchangeably and without regard to their proper

11:44.640 --> 11:50.160
usage, squished together in a vague play-doh ball of smug superiority, to be thrown wherever

11:50.160 --> 11:56.000
possible at their emotional and irrational enemies. Feminists, Marxists, liberals, SJWs,

11:56.000 --> 12:03.040
and definitely the feminist Marxist liberal SJW. Well, let's be honest here. A liberal can't be a

12:03.040 --> 12:07.600
Marxist, and a Marxist can't be a liberal. In fact, liberals and Marxists hate each other.

12:07.600 --> 12:13.360
You could call these men's ways of viewing the world in simple me-smart-you-dumb dichotomies

12:13.360 --> 12:17.280
Manchian, or even Derridean, if you really want to upset them by referencing a philosopher that

12:17.280 --> 12:23.520
they've heard is very bad. Well, I've actually read Derrida. I've had the unfortunate time of

12:23.520 --> 12:30.240
reading Derrida, and he is really bad. But you can definitely be a rational feminist.

12:30.240 --> 12:37.040
You can definitely be a rational Marxist, or a rational SJW, or obviously a rational liberal.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.920
That's why I said earlier that reasoning is subjective. Because smart people, if they start

12:41.920 --> 12:46.480
from a really shitty starting point, they can reason themselves into all sorts of terrible

12:46.480 --> 12:52.160
situations. There are honestly a lot of smart feminists and smart SJWs out there who actually

12:52.160 --> 12:57.440
believe that what they think is the objective truth because they started from a poisoned well.

12:57.440 --> 13:01.520
A good illustration of this phenomenon is an increasingly disturbing trend.

13:01.520 --> 13:07.040
Women whose once-promising romantic relationships implode after their boyfriends become redpilled.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.640
For the benefit of the blissfully uninitiated, to be redpilled means to internalize a set of

13:12.640 --> 13:16.880
misogynistic far-right beliefs popular with certain corners of the internet, the product

13:16.880 --> 13:23.280
of a noxious blend of junk science, conspiracy theory, and a pathological fear of social progress.

13:23.280 --> 13:29.520
You know, maybe. I've seen MGTOW communities, and honestly they can get pretty shitty sometime.

13:29.520 --> 13:34.960
I've seen redpilled communities, they get pretty shitty pretty fucking fast. But honestly,

13:34.960 --> 13:40.800
there is still, like, little bits of value to be gleaned by sifting through all of their bullshit.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.320
And in my opinion there's not much of it, but that doesn't mean that it's not there. However,

13:44.560 --> 13:50.240
I know what this author is really talking about, because you scroll back up here and they mention

13:50.240 --> 13:54.720
all of these things, the wider online right, alt-right, libertarian, conservative, intellectual

13:54.720 --> 13:59.520
dark web, moderate, centrist, okay? What this person is doing is talking about what it means

13:59.520 --> 14:04.080
to be redpilled and talking about these misogynistic far-right beliefs and then saying

14:04.080 --> 14:09.680
that all of these groups here, even the moderates and centrists, believe in this. This is how they're

14:09.680 --> 14:13.760
taking a fringe of people and then painting everyone that doesn't agree with them with the

14:13.760 --> 14:19.840
brush of that fringe's ideology. And that's just not how it works. For example, a lot of centrists,

14:19.840 --> 14:26.080
moderates, and even basic bitch conservatives don't have a pathological fear of social progress,

14:26.080 --> 14:30.240
rather they simply disagree with you on the definition of social progress.

14:30.240 --> 14:36.000
In regards to those little nuggets, those little bits of truth that exist within the MGTOW

14:36.000 --> 14:41.200
community or the red pill community, amongst all the other bullshit that those idiots spew out,

14:41.200 --> 14:47.200
in regards to those little bits of true fact, actual fact, I can definitely see their women

14:47.200 --> 14:53.120
folk, as this article puts it, simply disagreeing with those facts or even becoming offended that

14:53.120 --> 14:56.960
the guy's talking about them. Because this article is really implying that the women in these

14:56.960 --> 15:03.040
situations were all just completely infallible. And that's just not the case in any serious

15:03.040 --> 15:08.720
relationship, you know? There's give and take on both sides. And ideally that give and take

15:08.720 --> 15:15.120
should be 50-50, but there are going to be times when one partner is just objectively right,

15:15.120 --> 15:19.040
the other partner is just objectively wrong, and you have to work through that. And yeah,

15:19.760 --> 15:25.680
every once in a while, every once in a blue moon, that objective correctness might come

15:25.680 --> 15:31.600
from a community that you don't personally like. Sorry, but you may have to deal with that.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.680
For men, especially insecure and socially dislocated men,

15:35.760 --> 15:41.040
the idea of rationality can be kind of a comfort blanket. You know, I've heard this logic used

15:41.040 --> 15:47.040
before. I think both the author of this article and I can agree that socially dislocated or

15:47.040 --> 15:53.680
emotionally insecure men probably unjustly suffer sometimes, and they're probably prejudiced against

15:53.680 --> 15:58.640
sometimes. And making fun of them for having a comfort blanket is a bit ridiculous, especially

15:58.640 --> 16:04.640
because another oppressed group, like say women or some kind of racial minority, those subcultures

16:04.640 --> 16:10.080
also have their comfort blankets. And when you make fun of those subcultures' comfort blankets,

16:10.080 --> 16:15.200
it is a grave social sin, isn't it? Raised from birth with the stereotype that they are more

16:15.200 --> 16:20.400
analytically intelligent, in contrast to women who are emotionally intelligent, you know, I wasn't

16:20.400 --> 16:25.920
raised with that stereotype. And nonetheless, I do think that the data probably partially shows that.

16:25.920 --> 16:30.000
And with pop culture that venerates logical characters, and then she talks about Leonard

16:30.000 --> 16:35.520
Nimoy who played Spock, it's no wonder that many young men see logic as a sort of personality

16:35.520 --> 16:41.920
trait to achieve. Well, that's not why they do it. Spock being popular in the original Star Trek

16:41.920 --> 16:47.120
is not why young men want to be logical. In fact, there are hundreds of more popular and

16:47.120 --> 16:52.880
more contemporary characters in pop culture that men want to emulate, and their primary value

16:52.880 --> 16:59.360
isn't logic. It might be strength, it might be stoicism, it might be honor or duty. Sometimes

16:59.360 --> 17:04.800
it's definitely things like logic or rationality or intelligence. But these are all almost

17:04.800 --> 17:10.960
universally positive ideals. It's not unreasonable for men to want to emulate them. And you know what?

17:10.960 --> 17:15.200
It's not unreasonable for women to want to do it either. And then this person argues that being

17:15.200 --> 17:19.760
logical automatically imbues all one's opinions with correctness. No, it doesn't. In fact, there

17:19.760 --> 17:24.880
are multiple episodes of the original Star Trek series where Spock's logic was wrong.

17:25.760 --> 17:30.800
And that's the point. When you apply it and you apply it incorrectly, or sometimes you're dealing

17:30.800 --> 17:35.520
with a different situation where logic does not apply, it's not going to work out for you.

17:35.520 --> 17:41.040
Another common characteristic of these logicer-than-thou movements is a narrow focus

17:41.040 --> 17:46.160
on the type of skill that can be classified as intelligence. Affinity for things like social

17:46.160 --> 17:52.400
interaction, languages, or the arts, or at least certain types of art, often don't get a look in.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.960
Everything must be reductible to numbers, hence the typical logic lover's obsession with IQ.

17:57.600 --> 18:03.040
Well, first of all, everything's reductible to numbers because everything has to be measured.

18:04.800 --> 18:09.840
If you're going to be doing any kind of scientific analysis, you have to measure it. You have to have

18:09.840 --> 18:16.080
a way to see that very clearly one quantity is bigger or smaller than another quantity.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.920
If you can't do that, then you can't analyze anything. And the typical logic lover has an

18:21.920 --> 18:27.920
obsession with IQ because IQ is probably the single most rock-solid bit of psychological

18:27.920 --> 18:35.280
research done basically since psychology was invented. IQ is a huge variable regarding

18:35.280 --> 18:39.520
lifetime success. And these things that this person's mentioning, like affinity for things

18:39.520 --> 18:44.160
like the social interaction, languages, the arts, et cetera, that's not measured by IQ.

18:44.160 --> 18:49.200
That's a different kind of measurement. If you know anything about even... I took first-year

18:49.200 --> 18:54.800
psychology when I was in university, and I did learn about the big five, which are the big five

18:54.800 --> 18:59.840
personality traits, and things like social interaction, languages, and the arts, they have

18:59.840 --> 19:05.120
their own measurements within the big five. And one of the big five, conscientiousness,

19:05.760 --> 19:11.120
which basically means work ethic, honestly, when you really boil it down, conscientiousness along

19:11.120 --> 19:16.720
with IQ, you put those two together, you have something like, what is it, 80% of a person's

19:16.720 --> 19:21.520
likelihood to succeed at anything in their lives? So no, it really seems like the person who's

19:21.520 --> 19:28.720
writing this article, one, is coming at it from a point of ignorance, and two, in their ignorance,

19:28.720 --> 19:34.960
doesn't know what they're talking about. Repeat after me, calling something logic doesn't make

19:34.960 --> 19:41.520
it so. That's true. Calling someone rational doesn't make it so. That's also true.

19:42.160 --> 19:48.800
Opinions from YouTube men are not facts. True enough. Just like opinions from YouTube women

19:48.800 --> 19:54.800
aren't facts. Getting mad about philosophers you haven't read isn't reason. How about getting mad

19:54.800 --> 20:01.360
about philosophers you have read? Because I have read a lot of social justice bullshit in my time.

20:01.920 --> 20:07.120
Insulting your girlfriend because she questions your sudden political shift isn't logic. No,

20:07.120 --> 20:12.160
absolutely not. However, I do talk to my girlfriend regularly about politics,

20:12.720 --> 20:18.240
and sometimes we do disagree on things. And even at the end of the conversation, if we disagree,

20:19.040 --> 20:23.600
I think we're both able to at least articulate our points. If it turns into insults, you've done

20:23.600 --> 20:28.320
something wrong, both of you. Maybe you shouldn't be together. For a group of people who claim to

20:28.320 --> 20:35.120
hate the supposed redefinition of words when it comes to gender and race, it's not supposed.

20:35.120 --> 20:41.920
It's not. I watched the Sargon vs Destiny debate last night, where it was Destiny trying to say

20:41.920 --> 20:47.440
that trans women were real women, and should be included in the definition of women.

20:48.880 --> 20:54.400
When, in actuality, I think that, like very clearly from a biological sense, trans women

20:54.400 --> 20:59.040
aren't women. Anyone who's arguing that is an idiot. However, if you meet a trans woman,

20:59.040 --> 21:04.160
you should probably socially treat them like one, because it'd be polite. And even then,

21:04.160 --> 21:08.240
that politeness shouldn't be government enforced, you should always have the option of

21:08.240 --> 21:13.040
being an asshole and then being socially ostracized for being an asshole. But yeah,

21:13.040 --> 21:17.360
it's not a supposed redefinition, they're doing that shit. They're trying to do that shit.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.600
For a group of people who are very mad about the postmodern tendency to say

21:21.600 --> 21:26.640
nothing means anything, or at least this is an aspect of postmodernism they seem to have

21:26.640 --> 21:30.640
gleaned from their favorite subreddits, I gleaned it from my Derrida writings.

21:31.280 --> 21:35.760
I read them, man. I read them way back in the day when I went to university. I remember how

21:35.760 --> 21:40.080
bullshit it was then, and I still think it's bullshit now. Nothing means anything, and

21:40.080 --> 21:45.120
everything is a power struggle. That's the two most important parts of postmodernism.

21:45.120 --> 21:50.000
The new young reactionaries are remarkably devil may care about certain words,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.560
when they seem to lend credibility and strength to their opinions.

22:00.640 --> 22:06.480
The basic bitch conservatives. Most people who are center right. The intellectual dark web.

22:06.480 --> 22:12.400
None of those people are part of what you're talking about, and yet you are slandering them

22:12.400 --> 22:15.600
like they are part of what you're talking about. And that is what this whole article is.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.280
That is what the magical thinking of guys who love logic is.

22:19.280 --> 22:24.960
Here's a video I was sent, it's from BBC Sesh, whatever the fuck that is.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.080
It's a video on thin privilege, oh god.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.600
I'm gonna assume that the subtitles are there solely because you can't hear over the fucking

22:53.600 --> 23:13.200
music. Happens all the time. They call it manspreading in fact.

23:23.600 --> 23:29.360
Well, I'm a short fat otaku, so I never go outside.

23:36.400 --> 23:41.040
Holy shit, maybe you should be- that's a giant fucking donut.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.360
Maybe this is why you don't have thin privilege.

23:53.600 --> 24:15.680
You know, that's only partially true. You can look at a thin person and say,

24:15.680 --> 24:20.640
you know, that person might be healthy, or they might not be healthy, because you can't tell

24:21.280 --> 24:30.240
other problems that might be arising that have symptoms that aren't related to their size.

24:31.120 --> 24:35.120
However, you look at a fat person and say, that person's unhealthy. You can just know that,

24:35.120 --> 24:40.800
because they have a problem, and that problem is directly related to their large size.

24:42.080 --> 24:47.920
You cannot be fat and be healthy. It doesn't happen. You can definitely be thin and be

24:47.920 --> 24:51.200
unhealthy, but you can't be fat and healthy. It's impossible.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.680
Hey, everyone gets shit on the internet. That's just how it is.

25:18.080 --> 25:22.960
Just try putting yourself in someone else's shoes and just look at it from their point of view,

25:22.960 --> 25:28.000
how it could affect them or how it could make them feel. Not having to go at thin people at all,

25:28.000 --> 25:33.920
but just simply acknowledging there is the privilege that society has unfortunately put on

25:33.920 --> 25:39.600
people who are thinner. Just to combat it, just acknowledge it, be accepting of anybody of any

25:39.600 --> 25:44.720
size, and don't fall into what society and the media are trying to tell us that are right or

25:44.720 --> 25:48.400
wrong. There are bigger people in the world. There are smaller people in the world

25:48.400 --> 25:53.200
celebrating everybody's differences. Everybody being kind to one another, regardless of your size.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.760
Yeah, if you want thin privilege, you can go out and get it. You can go out and earn it.

26:03.040 --> 26:10.560
It might be hard. No one's going to say it's easy. You can do it. First of all,

26:10.560 --> 26:17.440
privilege is kind of a strange theory in itself because it's not quite the way that SJWs say it

26:17.440 --> 26:24.640
is. However, even within that idea, thin privilege and fat oppression is completely different from

26:24.640 --> 26:30.080
something like racial privilege. Unless you're going to go and do a Michael Jackson sort of

26:30.080 --> 26:36.320
situation, if you're black, you can't become white. Unless for some reason you're going to

26:36.320 --> 26:41.360
be a Rachel Dolezal or a Talcum X. If you're white, you can't become black.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.680
It's something that you're born with. It's something that you will have for the rest of

26:45.680 --> 26:50.560
your life. And now we can discuss whether that should be adequately called privilege and

26:50.560 --> 26:56.240
oppression. We can discuss what the effects of it are, but no one can argue that you are born

26:56.240 --> 27:02.320
with your race. You are born with your physical sex. There are certain immutable characteristics

27:02.320 --> 27:07.600
about you. Being thin and fat is not one of those immutable characteristics.

27:07.600 --> 27:12.720
And I know a lot of SJWs like to say that privilege can never be earned. It can only

27:12.720 --> 27:17.840
be granted by society. And if that's the case, then thin privilege doesn't exist because you

27:17.840 --> 27:24.000
can earn it. You can take a fat person, they can go work out at the gym for a year and stay on a

27:24.000 --> 27:29.440
diet and they will look fucking amazing. One year can do it. Six months can do it if you really

27:29.440 --> 27:34.960
stick to it. I mean, that's the reason why I'm so fat after like seven years of attempts.

27:34.960 --> 27:39.520
So no, even by their own definition, thin privilege isn't a thing and fat oppression

27:39.520 --> 27:44.560
also isn't a thing. Let's end off with something goofy here on comicbook.com.

27:44.560 --> 27:49.040
Pokemon Sword and Shield introduces the perfect starter for Pokemon for millennials.

27:49.040 --> 27:54.560
Now the eighth generation of Pokemon games, Sword and Shield, was released on Nintendo Direct a

27:54.560 --> 27:58.640
couple days ago. I've always been a pretty big Pokemon fan back from when I was a kid,

27:58.640 --> 28:02.480
so I'm pretty hyped about it. Apparently the game this time is set in the UK,

28:03.280 --> 28:08.640
so there's been a lot of meme images going around of the main characters in the game acting like

28:08.640 --> 28:12.720
rowdy Scottish people, which is pretty fucking hilarious. But this article has to do with one

28:12.720 --> 28:18.240
of the three starter Pokemon in the game this time around, the Water-type Sobble. While all three new

28:18.240 --> 28:22.480
starter Pokemon were well-received, it seems that the millennial generation that grew up with

28:22.480 --> 28:28.000
Pokemon has adopted Sobble as its new mascot. Sobble is a Water-type Pokemon that is described

28:28.000 --> 28:32.800
as a somewhat timid Water Lizard Pokemon that shoots out attacks as it hides itself in the

28:32.800 --> 28:39.200
water. Many Pokemon fans, especially those who grapple with anxiety or are introverts,

28:39.920 --> 28:46.160
instantly relate to this precious Water-type Pokemon. Judging from Sobble's shocked and wary

28:46.160 --> 28:52.320
looks, we imagine the Pokemon probably works 60 hours a week to pay for its overwhelming student

28:52.320 --> 28:58.640
debt and rising rent rates. As a Water-type Pokemon, Sobble is also probably perpetually

28:58.640 --> 29:02.960
concerned about climate change and other problems that it will have to deal with that were caused by

29:02.960 --> 29:07.760
the previous generations of Pokemon. Sobble is tired of being blamed for the deaths of things

29:07.760 --> 29:13.280
like country clubs, terrible chain restaurants, and styrofoam, none of which are really worth

29:13.280 --> 29:17.440
the money needed to prop up the trappings of the baby boomer generations of Pokemon.

29:17.440 --> 29:23.040
Plus, since Galar is an analogue to the British Isles, Sobble is also probably stunned about the

29:23.040 --> 29:29.120
self-destructive Gale Exit movement that seems determined to cripple the country and make its

29:29.120 --> 29:36.000
life even more miserable. The world's problems probably weigh heavily on Sobble, and it probably

29:36.000 --> 29:41.600
resents Scorbunny for posting travel pictures on Instagram and Grookey for acting like it's still

29:41.600 --> 29:46.480
in college and showing up to work hungover on a Wednesday after a long night at the pub with its

29:46.480 --> 29:52.400
rugby mates. It wishes it could enjoy itself like other starter Pokemon, but it neither has the

29:52.400 --> 30:00.800
time, money, nor energy to overcome the existential dread that keeps it up at night. It's a fucking

30:00.800 --> 30:09.360
Pokemon. Look at these fucking soft boys. Sobble is the manifestation of my millennial anxiety.

30:09.360 --> 30:14.400
Sobble really hit the millennial zennial anxiety zeitgeist and the results are good.

30:14.400 --> 30:19.200
Sobble sounds like you're sobbing while trying to cobble a life together and that's why he's the

30:19.200 --> 30:24.160
perfect representation of millennial dread and anxiety. He's just as worried about his future as

30:24.160 --> 30:29.440
all of us. Come here sad little tadpole, I choose you. Sobble has severe anxiety and had to drop out

30:29.440 --> 30:33.840
of college but still has a ton of student loans and worries people will judge him for it. So quite

30:33.840 --> 30:38.560
literally this article was written by these tweets it sounds like. They just took other people's

30:38.560 --> 30:44.160
tweets and formed them into an article. Anyway this is fucking stupid and it only serves to

30:44.160 --> 30:50.720
re-cement my belief that millennials are a softened generation of people. Anyway I'm done

30:50.720 --> 30:55.920
here guys. As it turns out even though I wanted this to be a shorter one it was still quite long

30:55.920 --> 31:01.120
so here we are. I'll see you guys on Twitch tonight twitch.tv slash game boomers. I'm gonna

31:01.120 --> 31:08.080
be playing Tales of Vesperia the new HD re-release of the game. I hope to see you there. Drop by,

31:08.080 --> 31:11.600
say hi. Have a good day my friends. I love you.
