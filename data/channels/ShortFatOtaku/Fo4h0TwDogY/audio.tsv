0	5040	Hello my friends, welcome to the Weekly Sip. Today I've got some hazelnut coffee.
10560	15920	I've realized I have a number of really large video projects, not like the 10 minute or less
15920	21120	ones that I've been doing recently, but a number of really long projects that are about half done
21120	26640	and that I have to get going on, like, you know, KickVic or the Balsanaro video. So this time
26640	31360	around I'm going to zip through the Weekly Sip as quick as I can. It'll be a smaller one,
31360	35120	so I can get back to work on those projects. I want to get them out sometime this week,
35120	41120	hopefully. Let's begin with this article on The Star. The Star is a Canadian paper. It's Canada's
41120	46480	duty to repatriate the brides of Daesh. Daesh is ISIS, by the way. Now those of you who watched
46480	53280	my video called The Brides of ISIS, this article came out literally hours later after I put that
53280	59440	video out, and I kind of wish I had waited on it because holy shit, this is a ridiculous article.
59440	66240	Jihadi brides and caliphate cubs with the men dead imprisoned on the lam. Their wives and children
66240	72720	are coming home to roost. No they're not. No they're not. Idiotic girls, teenagers mostly,
72720	78320	who pack themselves off to Syria and Northern Iraq, slipping away from families, willingly
78320	84640	giving up passports, sometimes taking up arms, often gleefully pumping out propaganda against
84640	90400	the nations of their birth, urging others to join them. Breeding, because that, it turned out,
90400	96160	was their primary value to ISIS. To populate the nascent state as housewives and mothers,
96160	102320	brood mares for the next generation of Islamist zealots. Yeah, that's why they can't come back.
102880	107280	They did all of those terrible things. But there's nothing left of the caliphate
107280	112080	except for an ideology. Well, the ideology is the most important part, isn't it? The ideology
112080	117280	is what will allow the caliphate to someday reappear. It's not something that's insignificant,
117280	123520	as you seem to say here. It's in fact the most important part. It's why the fighting can't stop.
123520	128320	At least three of those women, identified by name in media reports, are Canadians,
128320	132880	as would be their offspring regardless of the father's nationality. I'm not sure if that's the
132880	137520	case under Canadian law. It might be. I know that Canada definitely has birthright citizenship,
137520	143280	so it's definitely possible that those kids are Canadian. They are subsisting those woe-begone
143280	149040	dregs of the caliphate in tents without heat, with little food and scarce medical supplies.
149040	154080	The children are dying by the week. Many others didn't survive the exodus. They're not to blame.
154800	159600	When they say, uh, they're not to blame, if they're referring to the children, that's actually
159600	163440	true. You know, the kids are not to blame. They're not to blame for the actions of their parents.
164400	169760	However, if they mean the women aren't to blame, yes they are. The women aren't children. I know
169760	172720	they like to pair women and children a lot together, but the women aren't children.
173280	178800	They are adults. They have fully developed brains. They make their own choices, and they
178800	183200	have to deal with the consequences of their actions. Yet Ottawa has no plan to repatriate
183200	188480	these innocent victims, hasn't even offered counselor services to their mothers. Well,
188480	195840	you know what? It sucks. But one, the women aren't innocent victims. Two, even if the children are
195840	202000	innocent victims, their mothers aren't. And if we're keeping the kids with the mothers, then the
202000	205920	kids have to stay with the mothers, which is not in Canada. Like, look at this, look at this. Here's
205920	211280	that woman that I mentioned in the previous video, Kimberly Gwen Polman. She says, I don't have the
211280	216000	words for how much regret I have, and that she was thrown in jail and raped when she tried to flee
216000	222080	ISIS. Yet the brutal crimes of ISIS beheading journalists, mass rape of Yazidi minority women,
222080	226720	were well documented by the time Polman crossed the border into the Islamic State. She was already
226720	231520	the mother of three grown children, not a naive ISIS fangirl. I'm not interested in bloodshed,
231520	236880	and I don't know what to believe. These are videos on YouTube. What's real? What's not real?
236880	243280	You're an idiot. Like, that's it. It's true. You're not a naive ISIS fangirl. You're not some
243280	248480	teenager who makes a big mistake, destroys their life, and goes across the border. You're 46 and
248480	253760	you did this. You're an idiot. And that's it. There's nothing else to say about it.
253760	259520	Abdul Karim Omar, de facto foreign minister in the Kurdish-held north, said he and the Syrian
259520	265440	democratic forces have more than done their part. Over to you, Western nations. Noting that at least
265440	270400	six British jihadis are being held in prison, including two members of the notorious Beatles
270400	274800	gang accused of beheading Western hostages. Omar warned that the imprisoned men were likely to
274800	280240	escape or be set free in the anticipated combat to come. So his logic is that Western nations should
280240	287280	take these people back, because if they don't, the area, as he says, is not stable politically
287280	292400	or militarily. And during the fighting, those people will be set free and they'll run off into
292400	296480	the wild and then they may end up re-radicalizing or something. And that's certainly possible.
297440	301680	If Canada takes anybody, it should take them to put them in jail and put them in jail for the
301680	306080	rest of their lives. And he's right here. If there's war and attacks, those fighters and
306080	310720	their wives will come back to Britain and be terrorists. That's true. That's what they'll do.
310720	315920	We basically have two choices here and the choices suck. We can allow them back in and then
315920	321760	immediately throw them in prison. Or we can ignore them and then they'll come back as sleeper cells.
322560	326560	And that's it. Of course, there's the third option, which is completely ridiculous,
326560	330640	which is just allow them back in to just resettle in Canada. And it's like, okay,
330640	334480	yeah, just come back in. You didn't do anything wrong. It's fine. You're just a citizen. That
334480	339520	would be disastrous. The article goes over a lot of the stuff that I brought up in my previous
339520	344160	video. Let's check out the ending here. Apart from the firmly unrepentant, it's what they all claim,
344160	349280	the ISIS camp followers who now want to come home, but their misadventure is behind them.
349280	352720	Some of them readily acknowledging they should be tried and sent to prison,
352720	357200	although it's unclear for what offenses. Perhaps material support to a terrorist organization.
357920	363040	Perhaps treason. You know, I'm not somebody who likes to throw around the charge of treason
363040	367840	lately because it sounds like a ridiculous charge in the modern age, doesn't it? There should be no
367840	373600	compulsion for blind loyalty to your home country, especially in the face of your home country being
374560	381120	somehow corrupt or committing some kind of terrible immoral acts. You don't have to be
381120	385520	loyal to a place just because you were born there. And the charge of treason implies that you do.
385520	390240	However, this is about as black and white of a case as we could probably get, at least in
390240	396080	the modern world. Western countries for all of their faults are still the best places to live
396080	400800	for a reason. And if you actually want to qualify ISIS as an official country,
400800	405040	it was probably the worst country on the planet during the years that it existed.
405040	409120	Professing their ignorance, these women portray themselves as no more responsible for their poor
409120	414880	judgment than the children they've born. Yeah, that's because they recognize that that bundle
414880	420240	in their arms is actually innocent and they want to latch themselves to it and try to come back.
420240	426480	As repugnant as they may be, they can't be left to rot in war and refugee camps. Certainly their
426480	431120	children are victims deserving of deliverance and children shouldn't be separated from their
431120	434720	mothers. No, no, no, no, no. In this case, children should be separated from their mothers.
435360	441920	There are many cases where a mother does not deserve to have her children. Many cases. We
441920	447440	do this all the time as a society. We find unfit mothers and unfit fathers and we take their kids
447440	453760	from them. And if we are allowing these jihadi children back into Canada, and I think we should,
453760	458160	their mothers can't come with them. And that's that. That's that. They can't come.
458160	462640	If they come to Canada, they go to prison. That's how it has to be. However, I'm sure there's at
462640	467040	least a few SJWs out there who would say that I'm being too logical and not emotional enough.
467040	471360	So let's cover that article now. The magical thinking of guys who love logic.
474240	481120	Why so many men online love to use logic in scare quotes to win an argument and then disappear
481120	484880	before they can find out they're wrong. The thing about logic, it's not necessarily infallible.
485920	490480	Logic can change just the way that science can change. You discover new facts and then
490480	494400	your opinion changes. That makes sense. But at the very least, if you're being logical,
495200	501440	I think it's safe to say that you're using some kind of tool set in a pursuit of an objective
501440	506080	truth, which is certainly something that you can't say for people who use emotion as their guide
506080	511680	post. Ian Danskin, who makes videos under the moniker Innuendo Studios, has made a name for
511680	515680	himself on the internet for his YouTube series on the techniques and beliefs of the alt-right.
516400	521120	His most recent video, The Card Says Moops, is worth watching in full, but there was one
521120	525680	particular line in it that struck me. Danskin points out that even when their beliefs skew
525680	532000	towards the bizarre and conspiratorial, people on the online right often identify as rationalists.
532960	537920	Well, first of all, I mean, there's a few problems here. One, logic and reason are the same thing.
539360	545280	They're actually opposing values, believe it or not. Logic is meant to be significantly more
545280	550480	objective than reason. Reasoning is often subjective, and it's meant to be subjective.
550480	556080	It's meant to be like your own personal logic, in a sense. Logic is about tangible proof,
556640	562560	while reasoning is the capacity to make sense of stimulus. They're not the same thing. And bringing
562560	569360	up the term rationalists invokes the art of reasoning more than it does logic. This will
569360	574560	be unsurprising to those who often engage with the wider online right, whether it is with someone who
574560	581360	identifies as alt-right, libertarian, conservative, as a fan of the intellectual dark web, or even
581360	588400	moderate or centrist. So hear me out here. Is this how the left is identifying this now,
588400	594720	the far left? The online right is somebody who's alt-right, libertarian, conservative,
595520	602080	in the intellectual dark web, moderate or centrist. That's the right now, is everything
602080	610560	that's not left. People talk about the overtime window. People talk about how centrist figures,
610560	615600	like Sargon or even Dankula seems a little bit centrist. They're getting labeled as alt-right
615600	620000	or far-right or right-adjacent or whatever the fuck. I've been labeled as alt-right,
620000	624880	even though I'm definitely a center-lefty. There's been this conspiracy that the far left views
624880	631120	anything that is not the far left as the right, and I guess this paragraph confirms it. Although
631120	635680	their beliefs may not be identical, there are common distinct patterns in the way they speak
635680	641440	or type that one can't help but notice. So it's not even about the substance of their arguments,
641440	646080	it's about how they present themselves. That's what makes you alt-right now. You can believe
646080	651760	the exact same thing that somebody on the far left believes, but if you don't march in lockstep with
651760	657440	them, you're part of the right. Specifically, these guys, and they are usually guys, love
657440	662160	using terms like logic. They will tell you over and over how they love to use logic,
662720	668000	and how the people they follow online also use logic. They are also massive fans of
668000	673200	declaring that they have facts, that their analysis is unbiased, that they use reason
673200	680720	and logic and not emotions to make decisions. Well, is that the case? I mean, there are
680720	685360	definitely people out there who say, I'm using logic, and they're obviously not using logic, or
685360	689120	I'm reasonable, and they're obviously not being reasonable. Like, that happens. It happens
689120	694640	everywhere. But these people that you're talking about, are they actually logical?
694640	699920	Do they actually have the facts? I mean, doesn't that matter more than how they're coming across
699920	704640	to you personally? These words are usually used interchangeably and without regard to their proper
704640	710160	usage, squished together in a vague play-doh ball of smug superiority, to be thrown wherever
710160	716000	possible at their emotional and irrational enemies. Feminists, Marxists, liberals, SJWs,
716000	723040	and definitely the feminist Marxist liberal SJW. Well, let's be honest here. A liberal can't be a
723040	727600	Marxist, and a Marxist can't be a liberal. In fact, liberals and Marxists hate each other.
727600	733360	You could call these men's ways of viewing the world in simple me-smart-you-dumb dichotomies
733360	737280	Manchian, or even Derridean, if you really want to upset them by referencing a philosopher that
737280	743520	they've heard is very bad. Well, I've actually read Derrida. I've had the unfortunate time of
743520	750240	reading Derrida, and he is really bad. But you can definitely be a rational feminist.
750240	757040	You can definitely be a rational Marxist, or a rational SJW, or obviously a rational liberal.
757040	761920	That's why I said earlier that reasoning is subjective. Because smart people, if they start
761920	766480	from a really shitty starting point, they can reason themselves into all sorts of terrible
766480	772160	situations. There are honestly a lot of smart feminists and smart SJWs out there who actually
772160	777440	believe that what they think is the objective truth because they started from a poisoned well.
777440	781520	A good illustration of this phenomenon is an increasingly disturbing trend.
781520	787040	Women whose once-promising romantic relationships implode after their boyfriends become redpilled.
787760	792640	For the benefit of the blissfully uninitiated, to be redpilled means to internalize a set of
792640	796880	misogynistic far-right beliefs popular with certain corners of the internet, the product
796880	803280	of a noxious blend of junk science, conspiracy theory, and a pathological fear of social progress.
803280	809520	You know, maybe. I've seen MGTOW communities, and honestly they can get pretty shitty sometime.
809520	814960	I've seen redpilled communities, they get pretty shitty pretty fucking fast. But honestly,
814960	820800	there is still, like, little bits of value to be gleaned by sifting through all of their bullshit.
820800	824320	And in my opinion there's not much of it, but that doesn't mean that it's not there. However,
824560	830240	I know what this author is really talking about, because you scroll back up here and they mention
830240	834720	all of these things, the wider online right, alt-right, libertarian, conservative, intellectual
834720	839520	dark web, moderate, centrist, okay? What this person is doing is talking about what it means
839520	844080	to be redpilled and talking about these misogynistic far-right beliefs and then saying
844080	849680	that all of these groups here, even the moderates and centrists, believe in this. This is how they're
849680	853760	taking a fringe of people and then painting everyone that doesn't agree with them with the
853760	859840	brush of that fringe's ideology. And that's just not how it works. For example, a lot of centrists,
859840	866080	moderates, and even basic bitch conservatives don't have a pathological fear of social progress,
866080	870240	rather they simply disagree with you on the definition of social progress.
870240	876000	In regards to those little nuggets, those little bits of truth that exist within the MGTOW
876000	881200	community or the red pill community, amongst all the other bullshit that those idiots spew out,
881200	887200	in regards to those little bits of true fact, actual fact, I can definitely see their women
887200	893120	folk, as this article puts it, simply disagreeing with those facts or even becoming offended that
893120	896960	the guy's talking about them. Because this article is really implying that the women in these
896960	903040	situations were all just completely infallible. And that's just not the case in any serious
903040	908720	relationship, you know? There's give and take on both sides. And ideally that give and take
908720	915120	should be 50-50, but there are going to be times when one partner is just objectively right,
915120	919040	the other partner is just objectively wrong, and you have to work through that. And yeah,
919760	925680	every once in a while, every once in a blue moon, that objective correctness might come
925680	931600	from a community that you don't personally like. Sorry, but you may have to deal with that.
931600	935680	For men, especially insecure and socially dislocated men,
935760	941040	the idea of rationality can be kind of a comfort blanket. You know, I've heard this logic used
941040	947040	before. I think both the author of this article and I can agree that socially dislocated or
947040	953680	emotionally insecure men probably unjustly suffer sometimes, and they're probably prejudiced against
953680	958640	sometimes. And making fun of them for having a comfort blanket is a bit ridiculous, especially
958640	964640	because another oppressed group, like say women or some kind of racial minority, those subcultures
964640	970080	also have their comfort blankets. And when you make fun of those subcultures' comfort blankets,
970080	975200	it is a grave social sin, isn't it? Raised from birth with the stereotype that they are more
975200	980400	analytically intelligent, in contrast to women who are emotionally intelligent, you know, I wasn't
980400	985920	raised with that stereotype. And nonetheless, I do think that the data probably partially shows that.
985920	990000	And with pop culture that venerates logical characters, and then she talks about Leonard
990000	995520	Nimoy who played Spock, it's no wonder that many young men see logic as a sort of personality
995520	1001920	trait to achieve. Well, that's not why they do it. Spock being popular in the original Star Trek
1001920	1007120	is not why young men want to be logical. In fact, there are hundreds of more popular and
1007120	1012880	more contemporary characters in pop culture that men want to emulate, and their primary value
1012880	1019360	isn't logic. It might be strength, it might be stoicism, it might be honor or duty. Sometimes
1019360	1024800	it's definitely things like logic or rationality or intelligence. But these are all almost
1024800	1030960	universally positive ideals. It's not unreasonable for men to want to emulate them. And you know what?
1030960	1035200	It's not unreasonable for women to want to do it either. And then this person argues that being
1035200	1039760	logical automatically imbues all one's opinions with correctness. No, it doesn't. In fact, there
1039760	1044880	are multiple episodes of the original Star Trek series where Spock's logic was wrong.
1045760	1050800	And that's the point. When you apply it and you apply it incorrectly, or sometimes you're dealing
1050800	1055520	with a different situation where logic does not apply, it's not going to work out for you.
1055520	1061040	Another common characteristic of these logicer-than-thou movements is a narrow focus
1061040	1066160	on the type of skill that can be classified as intelligence. Affinity for things like social
1066160	1072400	interaction, languages, or the arts, or at least certain types of art, often don't get a look in.
1072720	1076960	Everything must be reductible to numbers, hence the typical logic lover's obsession with IQ.
1077600	1083040	Well, first of all, everything's reductible to numbers because everything has to be measured.
1084800	1089840	If you're going to be doing any kind of scientific analysis, you have to measure it. You have to have
1089840	1096080	a way to see that very clearly one quantity is bigger or smaller than another quantity.
1097280	1101920	If you can't do that, then you can't analyze anything. And the typical logic lover has an
1101920	1107920	obsession with IQ because IQ is probably the single most rock-solid bit of psychological
1107920	1115280	research done basically since psychology was invented. IQ is a huge variable regarding
1115280	1119520	lifetime success. And these things that this person's mentioning, like affinity for things
1119520	1124160	like the social interaction, languages, the arts, et cetera, that's not measured by IQ.
1124160	1129200	That's a different kind of measurement. If you know anything about even... I took first-year
1129200	1134800	psychology when I was in university, and I did learn about the big five, which are the big five
1134800	1139840	personality traits, and things like social interaction, languages, and the arts, they have
1139840	1145120	their own measurements within the big five. And one of the big five, conscientiousness,
1145760	1151120	which basically means work ethic, honestly, when you really boil it down, conscientiousness along
1151120	1156720	with IQ, you put those two together, you have something like, what is it, 80% of a person's
1156720	1161520	likelihood to succeed at anything in their lives? So no, it really seems like the person who's
1161520	1168720	writing this article, one, is coming at it from a point of ignorance, and two, in their ignorance,
1168720	1174960	doesn't know what they're talking about. Repeat after me, calling something logic doesn't make
1174960	1181520	it so. That's true. Calling someone rational doesn't make it so. That's also true.
1182160	1188800	Opinions from YouTube men are not facts. True enough. Just like opinions from YouTube women
1188800	1194800	aren't facts. Getting mad about philosophers you haven't read isn't reason. How about getting mad
1194800	1201360	about philosophers you have read? Because I have read a lot of social justice bullshit in my time.
1201920	1207120	Insulting your girlfriend because she questions your sudden political shift isn't logic. No,
1207120	1212160	absolutely not. However, I do talk to my girlfriend regularly about politics,
1212720	1218240	and sometimes we do disagree on things. And even at the end of the conversation, if we disagree,
1219040	1223600	I think we're both able to at least articulate our points. If it turns into insults, you've done
1223600	1228320	something wrong, both of you. Maybe you shouldn't be together. For a group of people who claim to
1228320	1235120	hate the supposed redefinition of words when it comes to gender and race, it's not supposed.
1235120	1241920	It's not. I watched the Sargon vs Destiny debate last night, where it was Destiny trying to say
1241920	1247440	that trans women were real women, and should be included in the definition of women.
1248880	1254400	When, in actuality, I think that, like very clearly from a biological sense, trans women
1254400	1259040	aren't women. Anyone who's arguing that is an idiot. However, if you meet a trans woman,
1259040	1264160	you should probably socially treat them like one, because it'd be polite. And even then,
1264160	1268240	that politeness shouldn't be government enforced, you should always have the option of
1268240	1273040	being an asshole and then being socially ostracized for being an asshole. But yeah,
1273040	1277360	it's not a supposed redefinition, they're doing that shit. They're trying to do that shit.
1277360	1281600	For a group of people who are very mad about the postmodern tendency to say
1281600	1286640	nothing means anything, or at least this is an aspect of postmodernism they seem to have
1286640	1290640	gleaned from their favorite subreddits, I gleaned it from my Derrida writings.
1291280	1295760	I read them, man. I read them way back in the day when I went to university. I remember how
1295760	1300080	bullshit it was then, and I still think it's bullshit now. Nothing means anything, and
1300080	1305120	everything is a power struggle. That's the two most important parts of postmodernism.
1305120	1310000	The new young reactionaries are remarkably devil may care about certain words,
1310000	1312560	when they seem to lend credibility and strength to their opinions.
1320640	1326480	The basic bitch conservatives. Most people who are center right. The intellectual dark web.
1326480	1332400	None of those people are part of what you're talking about, and yet you are slandering them
1332400	1335600	like they are part of what you're talking about. And that is what this whole article is.
1335600	1339280	That is what the magical thinking of guys who love logic is.
1339280	1344960	Here's a video I was sent, it's from BBC Sesh, whatever the fuck that is.
1345840	1348080	It's a video on thin privilege, oh god.
1368000	1373600	I'm gonna assume that the subtitles are there solely because you can't hear over the fucking
1373600	1393200	music. Happens all the time. They call it manspreading in fact.
1403600	1409360	Well, I'm a short fat otaku, so I never go outside.
1416400	1421040	Holy shit, maybe you should be- that's a giant fucking donut.
1422640	1425360	Maybe this is why you don't have thin privilege.
1433600	1455680	You know, that's only partially true. You can look at a thin person and say,
1455680	1460640	you know, that person might be healthy, or they might not be healthy, because you can't tell
1461280	1470240	other problems that might be arising that have symptoms that aren't related to their size.
1471120	1475120	However, you look at a fat person and say, that person's unhealthy. You can just know that,
1475120	1480800	because they have a problem, and that problem is directly related to their large size.
1482080	1487920	You cannot be fat and be healthy. It doesn't happen. You can definitely be thin and be
1487920	1491200	unhealthy, but you can't be fat and healthy. It's impossible.
1501600	1505680	Hey, everyone gets shit on the internet. That's just how it is.
1518080	1522960	Just try putting yourself in someone else's shoes and just look at it from their point of view,
1522960	1528000	how it could affect them or how it could make them feel. Not having to go at thin people at all,
1528000	1533920	but just simply acknowledging there is the privilege that society has unfortunately put on
1533920	1539600	people who are thinner. Just to combat it, just acknowledge it, be accepting of anybody of any
1539600	1544720	size, and don't fall into what society and the media are trying to tell us that are right or
1544720	1548400	wrong. There are bigger people in the world. There are smaller people in the world
1548400	1553200	celebrating everybody's differences. Everybody being kind to one another, regardless of your size.
1557440	1561760	Yeah, if you want thin privilege, you can go out and get it. You can go out and earn it.
1563040	1570560	It might be hard. No one's going to say it's easy. You can do it. First of all,
1570560	1577440	privilege is kind of a strange theory in itself because it's not quite the way that SJWs say it
1577440	1584640	is. However, even within that idea, thin privilege and fat oppression is completely different from
1584640	1590080	something like racial privilege. Unless you're going to go and do a Michael Jackson sort of
1590080	1596320	situation, if you're black, you can't become white. Unless for some reason you're going to
1596320	1601360	be a Rachel Dolezal or a Talcum X. If you're white, you can't become black.
1602640	1605680	It's something that you're born with. It's something that you will have for the rest of
1605680	1610560	your life. And now we can discuss whether that should be adequately called privilege and
1610560	1616240	oppression. We can discuss what the effects of it are, but no one can argue that you are born
1616240	1622320	with your race. You are born with your physical sex. There are certain immutable characteristics
1622320	1627600	about you. Being thin and fat is not one of those immutable characteristics.
1627600	1632720	And I know a lot of SJWs like to say that privilege can never be earned. It can only
1632720	1637840	be granted by society. And if that's the case, then thin privilege doesn't exist because you
1637840	1644000	can earn it. You can take a fat person, they can go work out at the gym for a year and stay on a
1644000	1649440	diet and they will look fucking amazing. One year can do it. Six months can do it if you really
1649440	1654960	stick to it. I mean, that's the reason why I'm so fat after like seven years of attempts.
1654960	1659520	So no, even by their own definition, thin privilege isn't a thing and fat oppression
1659520	1664560	also isn't a thing. Let's end off with something goofy here on comicbook.com.
1664560	1669040	Pokemon Sword and Shield introduces the perfect starter for Pokemon for millennials.
1669040	1674560	Now the eighth generation of Pokemon games, Sword and Shield, was released on Nintendo Direct a
1674560	1678640	couple days ago. I've always been a pretty big Pokemon fan back from when I was a kid,
1678640	1682480	so I'm pretty hyped about it. Apparently the game this time is set in the UK,
1683280	1688640	so there's been a lot of meme images going around of the main characters in the game acting like
1688640	1692720	rowdy Scottish people, which is pretty fucking hilarious. But this article has to do with one
1692720	1698240	of the three starter Pokemon in the game this time around, the Water-type Sobble. While all three new
1698240	1702480	starter Pokemon were well-received, it seems that the millennial generation that grew up with
1702480	1708000	Pokemon has adopted Sobble as its new mascot. Sobble is a Water-type Pokemon that is described
1708000	1712800	as a somewhat timid Water Lizard Pokemon that shoots out attacks as it hides itself in the
1712800	1719200	water. Many Pokemon fans, especially those who grapple with anxiety or are introverts,
1719920	1726160	instantly relate to this precious Water-type Pokemon. Judging from Sobble's shocked and wary
1726160	1732320	looks, we imagine the Pokemon probably works 60 hours a week to pay for its overwhelming student
1732320	1738640	debt and rising rent rates. As a Water-type Pokemon, Sobble is also probably perpetually
1738640	1742960	concerned about climate change and other problems that it will have to deal with that were caused by
1742960	1747760	the previous generations of Pokemon. Sobble is tired of being blamed for the deaths of things
1747760	1753280	like country clubs, terrible chain restaurants, and styrofoam, none of which are really worth
1753280	1757440	the money needed to prop up the trappings of the baby boomer generations of Pokemon.
1757440	1763040	Plus, since Galar is an analogue to the British Isles, Sobble is also probably stunned about the
1763040	1769120	self-destructive Gale Exit movement that seems determined to cripple the country and make its
1769120	1776000	life even more miserable. The world's problems probably weigh heavily on Sobble, and it probably
1776000	1781600	resents Scorbunny for posting travel pictures on Instagram and Grookey for acting like it's still
1781600	1786480	in college and showing up to work hungover on a Wednesday after a long night at the pub with its
1786480	1792400	rugby mates. It wishes it could enjoy itself like other starter Pokemon, but it neither has the
1792400	1800800	time, money, nor energy to overcome the existential dread that keeps it up at night. It's a fucking
1800800	1809360	Pokemon. Look at these fucking soft boys. Sobble is the manifestation of my millennial anxiety.
1809360	1814400	Sobble really hit the millennial zennial anxiety zeitgeist and the results are good.
1814400	1819200	Sobble sounds like you're sobbing while trying to cobble a life together and that's why he's the
1819200	1824160	perfect representation of millennial dread and anxiety. He's just as worried about his future as
1824160	1829440	all of us. Come here sad little tadpole, I choose you. Sobble has severe anxiety and had to drop out
1829440	1833840	of college but still has a ton of student loans and worries people will judge him for it. So quite
1833840	1838560	literally this article was written by these tweets it sounds like. They just took other people's
1838560	1844160	tweets and formed them into an article. Anyway this is fucking stupid and it only serves to
1844160	1850720	re-cement my belief that millennials are a softened generation of people. Anyway I'm done
1850720	1855920	here guys. As it turns out even though I wanted this to be a shorter one it was still quite long
1855920	1861120	so here we are. I'll see you guys on Twitch tonight twitch.tv slash game boomers. I'm gonna
1861120	1868080	be playing Tales of Vesperia the new HD re-release of the game. I hope to see you there. Drop by,
1868080	1871600	say hi. Have a good day my friends. I love you.
