00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello my friends, welcome to the Weekly Sip. Today I've got some hazelnut coffee.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,920
I've realized I have a number of really large video projects, not like the 10 minute or less

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,120
ones that I've been doing recently, but a number of really long projects that are about half done

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,640
and that I have to get going on, like, you know, KickVic or the Balsanaro video. So this time

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,360
around I'm going to zip through the Weekly Sip as quick as I can. It'll be a smaller one,

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,120
so I can get back to work on those projects. I want to get them out sometime this week,

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,120
hopefully. Let's begin with this article on The Star. The Star is a Canadian paper. It's Canada's

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,480
duty to repatriate the brides of Daesh. Daesh is ISIS, by the way. Now those of you who watched

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,280
my video called The Brides of ISIS, this article came out literally hours later after I put that

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,440
video out, and I kind of wish I had waited on it because holy shit, this is a ridiculous article.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,240
Jihadi brides and caliphate cubs with the men dead imprisoned on the lam. Their wives and children

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,720
are coming home to roost. No they're not. No they're not. Idiotic girls, teenagers mostly,

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,320
who pack themselves off to Syria and Northern Iraq, slipping away from families, willingly

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,640
giving up passports, sometimes taking up arms, often gleefully pumping out propaganda against

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,400
the nations of their birth, urging others to join them. Breeding, because that, it turned out,

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,160
was their primary value to ISIS. To populate the nascent state as housewives and mothers,

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,320
brood mares for the next generation of Islamist zealots. Yeah, that's why they can't come back.

18
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,280
They did all of those terrible things. But there's nothing left of the caliphate

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,080
except for an ideology. Well, the ideology is the most important part, isn't it? The ideology

20
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,280
is what will allow the caliphate to someday reappear. It's not something that's insignificant,

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,520
as you seem to say here. It's in fact the most important part. It's why the fighting can't stop.

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,320
At least three of those women, identified by name in media reports, are Canadians,

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,880
as would be their offspring regardless of the father's nationality. I'm not sure if that's the

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,520
case under Canadian law. It might be. I know that Canada definitely has birthright citizenship,

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,280
so it's definitely possible that those kids are Canadian. They are subsisting those woe-begone

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,040
dregs of the caliphate in tents without heat, with little food and scarce medical supplies.

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,080
The children are dying by the week. Many others didn't survive the exodus. They're not to blame.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,600
When they say, uh, they're not to blame, if they're referring to the children, that's actually

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,440
true. You know, the kids are not to blame. They're not to blame for the actions of their parents.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,760
However, if they mean the women aren't to blame, yes they are. The women aren't children. I know

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,720
they like to pair women and children a lot together, but the women aren't children.

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
They are adults. They have fully developed brains. They make their own choices, and they

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
have to deal with the consequences of their actions. Yet Ottawa has no plan to repatriate

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,480
these innocent victims, hasn't even offered counselor services to their mothers. Well,

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,840
you know what? It sucks. But one, the women aren't innocent victims. Two, even if the children are

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,000
innocent victims, their mothers aren't. And if we're keeping the kids with the mothers, then the

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,920
kids have to stay with the mothers, which is not in Canada. Like, look at this, look at this. Here's

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,280
that woman that I mentioned in the previous video, Kimberly Gwen Polman. She says, I don't have the

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
words for how much regret I have, and that she was thrown in jail and raped when she tried to flee

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,080
ISIS. Yet the brutal crimes of ISIS beheading journalists, mass rape of Yazidi minority women,

41
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,720
were well documented by the time Polman crossed the border into the Islamic State. She was already

42
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,520
the mother of three grown children, not a naive ISIS fangirl. I'm not interested in bloodshed,

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,880
and I don't know what to believe. These are videos on YouTube. What's real? What's not real?

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,280
You're an idiot. Like, that's it. It's true. You're not a naive ISIS fangirl. You're not some

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,480
teenager who makes a big mistake, destroys their life, and goes across the border. You're 46 and

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,760
you did this. You're an idiot. And that's it. There's nothing else to say about it.

47
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,520
Abdul Karim Omar, de facto foreign minister in the Kurdish-held north, said he and the Syrian

48
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,440
democratic forces have more than done their part. Over to you, Western nations. Noting that at least

49
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,400
six British jihadis are being held in prison, including two members of the notorious Beatles

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,800
gang accused of beheading Western hostages. Omar warned that the imprisoned men were likely to

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,240
escape or be set free in the anticipated combat to come. So his logic is that Western nations should

52
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,280
take these people back, because if they don't, the area, as he says, is not stable politically

53
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,400
or militarily. And during the fighting, those people will be set free and they'll run off into

54
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,480
the wild and then they may end up re-radicalizing or something. And that's certainly possible.

55
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,680
If Canada takes anybody, it should take them to put them in jail and put them in jail for the

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,080
rest of their lives. And he's right here. If there's war and attacks, those fighters and

57
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,720
their wives will come back to Britain and be terrorists. That's true. That's what they'll do.

58
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,920
We basically have two choices here and the choices suck. We can allow them back in and then

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,760
immediately throw them in prison. Or we can ignore them and then they'll come back as sleeper cells.

60
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
And that's it. Of course, there's the third option, which is completely ridiculous,

61
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,640
which is just allow them back in to just resettle in Canada. And it's like, okay,

62
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,480
yeah, just come back in. You didn't do anything wrong. It's fine. You're just a citizen. That

63
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,520
would be disastrous. The article goes over a lot of the stuff that I brought up in my previous

64
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,160
video. Let's check out the ending here. Apart from the firmly unrepentant, it's what they all claim,

65
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
the ISIS camp followers who now want to come home, but their misadventure is behind them.

66
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
Some of them readily acknowledging they should be tried and sent to prison,

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,200
although it's unclear for what offenses. Perhaps material support to a terrorist organization.

68
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,040
Perhaps treason. You know, I'm not somebody who likes to throw around the charge of treason

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,840
lately because it sounds like a ridiculous charge in the modern age, doesn't it? There should be no

70
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,600
compulsion for blind loyalty to your home country, especially in the face of your home country being

71
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,120
somehow corrupt or committing some kind of terrible immoral acts. You don't have to be

72
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,520
loyal to a place just because you were born there. And the charge of treason implies that you do.

73
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,240
However, this is about as black and white of a case as we could probably get, at least in

74
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,080
the modern world. Western countries for all of their faults are still the best places to live

75
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,800
for a reason. And if you actually want to qualify ISIS as an official country,

76
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,040
it was probably the worst country on the planet during the years that it existed.

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,120
Professing their ignorance, these women portray themselves as no more responsible for their poor

78
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,880
judgment than the children they've born. Yeah, that's because they recognize that that bundle

79
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,240
in their arms is actually innocent and they want to latch themselves to it and try to come back.

80
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,480
As repugnant as they may be, they can't be left to rot in war and refugee camps. Certainly their

81
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,120
children are victims deserving of deliverance and children shouldn't be separated from their

82
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
mothers. No, no, no, no, no. In this case, children should be separated from their mothers.

83
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,920
There are many cases where a mother does not deserve to have her children. Many cases. We

84
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,440
do this all the time as a society. We find unfit mothers and unfit fathers and we take their kids

85
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,760
from them. And if we are allowing these jihadi children back into Canada, and I think we should,

86
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,160
their mothers can't come with them. And that's that. That's that. They can't come.

87
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,640
If they come to Canada, they go to prison. That's how it has to be. However, I'm sure there's at

88
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,040
least a few SJWs out there who would say that I'm being too logical and not emotional enough.

89
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,360
So let's cover that article now. The magical thinking of guys who love logic.

90
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,120
Why so many men online love to use logic in scare quotes to win an argument and then disappear

91
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,880
before they can find out they're wrong. The thing about logic, it's not necessarily infallible.

92
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,480
Logic can change just the way that science can change. You discover new facts and then

93
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,400
your opinion changes. That makes sense. But at the very least, if you're being logical,

94
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,440
I think it's safe to say that you're using some kind of tool set in a pursuit of an objective

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,080
truth, which is certainly something that you can't say for people who use emotion as their guide

96
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,680
post. Ian Danskin, who makes videos under the moniker Innuendo Studios, has made a name for

97
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
himself on the internet for his YouTube series on the techniques and beliefs of the alt-right.

98
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,120
His most recent video, The Card Says Moops, is worth watching in full, but there was one

99
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,680
particular line in it that struck me. Danskin points out that even when their beliefs skew

100
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,000
towards the bizarre and conspiratorial, people on the online right often identify as rationalists.

101
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,920
Well, first of all, I mean, there's a few problems here. One, logic and reason are the same thing.

102
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,280
They're actually opposing values, believe it or not. Logic is meant to be significantly more

103
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,480
objective than reason. Reasoning is often subjective, and it's meant to be subjective.

104
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,080
It's meant to be like your own personal logic, in a sense. Logic is about tangible proof,

105
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,560
while reasoning is the capacity to make sense of stimulus. They're not the same thing. And bringing

106
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,360
up the term rationalists invokes the art of reasoning more than it does logic. This will

107
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,560
be unsurprising to those who often engage with the wider online right, whether it is with someone who

108
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,360
identifies as alt-right, libertarian, conservative, as a fan of the intellectual dark web, or even

109
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,400
moderate or centrist. So hear me out here. Is this how the left is identifying this now,

110
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,720
the far left? The online right is somebody who's alt-right, libertarian, conservative,

111
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:02,080
in the intellectual dark web, moderate or centrist. That's the right now, is everything

112
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:10,560
that's not left. People talk about the overtime window. People talk about how centrist figures,

113
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,600
like Sargon or even Dankula seems a little bit centrist. They're getting labeled as alt-right

114
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,000
or far-right or right-adjacent or whatever the fuck. I've been labeled as alt-right,

115
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,880
even though I'm definitely a center-lefty. There's been this conspiracy that the far left views

116
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,120
anything that is not the far left as the right, and I guess this paragraph confirms it. Although

117
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,680
their beliefs may not be identical, there are common distinct patterns in the way they speak

118
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,440
or type that one can't help but notice. So it's not even about the substance of their arguments,

119
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,080
it's about how they present themselves. That's what makes you alt-right now. You can believe

120
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,760
the exact same thing that somebody on the far left believes, but if you don't march in lockstep with

121
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,440
them, you're part of the right. Specifically, these guys, and they are usually guys, love

122
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,160
using terms like logic. They will tell you over and over how they love to use logic,

123
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,000
and how the people they follow online also use logic. They are also massive fans of

124
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,200
declaring that they have facts, that their analysis is unbiased, that they use reason

125
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,720
and logic and not emotions to make decisions. Well, is that the case? I mean, there are

126
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
definitely people out there who say, I'm using logic, and they're obviously not using logic, or

127
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm reasonable, and they're obviously not being reasonable. Like, that happens. It happens

128
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,640
everywhere. But these people that you're talking about, are they actually logical?

129
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,920
Do they actually have the facts? I mean, doesn't that matter more than how they're coming across

130
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,640
to you personally? These words are usually used interchangeably and without regard to their proper

131
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,160
usage, squished together in a vague play-doh ball of smug superiority, to be thrown wherever

132
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,000
possible at their emotional and irrational enemies. Feminists, Marxists, liberals, SJWs,

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,040
and definitely the feminist Marxist liberal SJW. Well, let's be honest here. A liberal can't be a

134
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,600
Marxist, and a Marxist can't be a liberal. In fact, liberals and Marxists hate each other.

135
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,360
You could call these men's ways of viewing the world in simple me-smart-you-dumb dichotomies

136
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Manchian, or even Derridean, if you really want to upset them by referencing a philosopher that

137
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,520
they've heard is very bad. Well, I've actually read Derrida. I've had the unfortunate time of

138
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,240
reading Derrida, and he is really bad. But you can definitely be a rational feminist.

139
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,040
You can definitely be a rational Marxist, or a rational SJW, or obviously a rational liberal.

140
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,920
That's why I said earlier that reasoning is subjective. Because smart people, if they start

141
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,480
from a really shitty starting point, they can reason themselves into all sorts of terrible

142
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,160
situations. There are honestly a lot of smart feminists and smart SJWs out there who actually

143
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,440
believe that what they think is the objective truth because they started from a poisoned well.

144
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,520
A good illustration of this phenomenon is an increasingly disturbing trend.

145
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,040
Women whose once-promising romantic relationships implode after their boyfriends become redpilled.

146
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,640
For the benefit of the blissfully uninitiated, to be redpilled means to internalize a set of

147
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,880
misogynistic far-right beliefs popular with certain corners of the internet, the product

148
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,280
of a noxious blend of junk science, conspiracy theory, and a pathological fear of social progress.

149
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,520
You know, maybe. I've seen MGTOW communities, and honestly they can get pretty shitty sometime.

150
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,960
I've seen redpilled communities, they get pretty shitty pretty fucking fast. But honestly,

151
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,800
there is still, like, little bits of value to be gleaned by sifting through all of their bullshit.

152
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,320
And in my opinion there's not much of it, but that doesn't mean that it's not there. However,

153
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,240
I know what this author is really talking about, because you scroll back up here and they mention

154
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,720
all of these things, the wider online right, alt-right, libertarian, conservative, intellectual

155
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,520
dark web, moderate, centrist, okay? What this person is doing is talking about what it means

156
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,080
to be redpilled and talking about these misogynistic far-right beliefs and then saying

157
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,680
that all of these groups here, even the moderates and centrists, believe in this. This is how they're

158
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,760
taking a fringe of people and then painting everyone that doesn't agree with them with the

159
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,840
brush of that fringe's ideology. And that's just not how it works. For example, a lot of centrists,

160
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,080
moderates, and even basic bitch conservatives don't have a pathological fear of social progress,

161
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,240
rather they simply disagree with you on the definition of social progress.

162
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,000
In regards to those little nuggets, those little bits of truth that exist within the MGTOW

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,200
community or the red pill community, amongst all the other bullshit that those idiots spew out,

164
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,200
in regards to those little bits of true fact, actual fact, I can definitely see their women

165
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,120
folk, as this article puts it, simply disagreeing with those facts or even becoming offended that

166
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,960
the guy's talking about them. Because this article is really implying that the women in these

167
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,040
situations were all just completely infallible. And that's just not the case in any serious

168
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,720
relationship, you know? There's give and take on both sides. And ideally that give and take

169
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,120
should be 50-50, but there are going to be times when one partner is just objectively right,

170
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,040
the other partner is just objectively wrong, and you have to work through that. And yeah,

171
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,680
every once in a while, every once in a blue moon, that objective correctness might come

172
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,600
from a community that you don't personally like. Sorry, but you may have to deal with that.

173
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,680
For men, especially insecure and socially dislocated men,

174
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,040
the idea of rationality can be kind of a comfort blanket. You know, I've heard this logic used

175
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,040
before. I think both the author of this article and I can agree that socially dislocated or

176
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,680
emotionally insecure men probably unjustly suffer sometimes, and they're probably prejudiced against

177
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,640
sometimes. And making fun of them for having a comfort blanket is a bit ridiculous, especially

178
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,640
because another oppressed group, like say women or some kind of racial minority, those subcultures

179
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,080
also have their comfort blankets. And when you make fun of those subcultures' comfort blankets,

180
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,200
it is a grave social sin, isn't it? Raised from birth with the stereotype that they are more

181
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,400
analytically intelligent, in contrast to women who are emotionally intelligent, you know, I wasn't

182
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,920
raised with that stereotype. And nonetheless, I do think that the data probably partially shows that.

183
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,000
And with pop culture that venerates logical characters, and then she talks about Leonard

184
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,520
Nimoy who played Spock, it's no wonder that many young men see logic as a sort of personality

185
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,920
trait to achieve. Well, that's not why they do it. Spock being popular in the original Star Trek

186
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,120
is not why young men want to be logical. In fact, there are hundreds of more popular and

187
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,880
more contemporary characters in pop culture that men want to emulate, and their primary value

188
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,360
isn't logic. It might be strength, it might be stoicism, it might be honor or duty. Sometimes

189
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,800
it's definitely things like logic or rationality or intelligence. But these are all almost

190
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,960
universally positive ideals. It's not unreasonable for men to want to emulate them. And you know what?

191
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,200
It's not unreasonable for women to want to do it either. And then this person argues that being

192
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,760
logical automatically imbues all one's opinions with correctness. No, it doesn't. In fact, there

193
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,880
are multiple episodes of the original Star Trek series where Spock's logic was wrong.

194
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,800
And that's the point. When you apply it and you apply it incorrectly, or sometimes you're dealing

195
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,520
with a different situation where logic does not apply, it's not going to work out for you.

196
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,040
Another common characteristic of these logicer-than-thou movements is a narrow focus

197
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,160
on the type of skill that can be classified as intelligence. Affinity for things like social

198
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,400
interaction, languages, or the arts, or at least certain types of art, often don't get a look in.

199
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,960
Everything must be reductible to numbers, hence the typical logic lover's obsession with IQ.

200
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,040
Well, first of all, everything's reductible to numbers because everything has to be measured.

201
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,840
If you're going to be doing any kind of scientific analysis, you have to measure it. You have to have

202
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,080
a way to see that very clearly one quantity is bigger or smaller than another quantity.

203
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,920
If you can't do that, then you can't analyze anything. And the typical logic lover has an

204
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,920
obsession with IQ because IQ is probably the single most rock-solid bit of psychological

205
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:35,280
research done basically since psychology was invented. IQ is a huge variable regarding

206
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,520
lifetime success. And these things that this person's mentioning, like affinity for things

207
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,160
like the social interaction, languages, the arts, et cetera, that's not measured by IQ.

208
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,200
That's a different kind of measurement. If you know anything about even... I took first-year

209
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,800
psychology when I was in university, and I did learn about the big five, which are the big five

210
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,840
personality traits, and things like social interaction, languages, and the arts, they have

211
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,120
their own measurements within the big five. And one of the big five, conscientiousness,

212
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,120
which basically means work ethic, honestly, when you really boil it down, conscientiousness along

213
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,720
with IQ, you put those two together, you have something like, what is it, 80% of a person's

214
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,520
likelihood to succeed at anything in their lives? So no, it really seems like the person who's

215
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,720
writing this article, one, is coming at it from a point of ignorance, and two, in their ignorance,

216
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,960
doesn't know what they're talking about. Repeat after me, calling something logic doesn't make

217
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,520
it so. That's true. Calling someone rational doesn't make it so. That's also true.

218
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,800
Opinions from YouTube men are not facts. True enough. Just like opinions from YouTube women

219
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,800
aren't facts. Getting mad about philosophers you haven't read isn't reason. How about getting mad

220
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:01,360
about philosophers you have read? Because I have read a lot of social justice bullshit in my time.

221
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,120
Insulting your girlfriend because she questions your sudden political shift isn't logic. No,

222
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,160
absolutely not. However, I do talk to my girlfriend regularly about politics,

223
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,240
and sometimes we do disagree on things. And even at the end of the conversation, if we disagree,

224
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,600
I think we're both able to at least articulate our points. If it turns into insults, you've done

225
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,320
something wrong, both of you. Maybe you shouldn't be together. For a group of people who claim to

226
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,120
hate the supposed redefinition of words when it comes to gender and race, it's not supposed.

227
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,920
It's not. I watched the Sargon vs Destiny debate last night, where it was Destiny trying to say

228
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,440
that trans women were real women, and should be included in the definition of women.

229
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,400
When, in actuality, I think that, like very clearly from a biological sense, trans women

230
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,040
aren't women. Anyone who's arguing that is an idiot. However, if you meet a trans woman,

231
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,160
you should probably socially treat them like one, because it'd be polite. And even then,

232
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,240
that politeness shouldn't be government enforced, you should always have the option of

233
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,040
being an asshole and then being socially ostracized for being an asshole. But yeah,

234
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,360
it's not a supposed redefinition, they're doing that shit. They're trying to do that shit.

235
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,600
For a group of people who are very mad about the postmodern tendency to say

236
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,640
nothing means anything, or at least this is an aspect of postmodernism they seem to have

237
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,640
gleaned from their favorite subreddits, I gleaned it from my Derrida writings.

238
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,760
I read them, man. I read them way back in the day when I went to university. I remember how

239
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,080
bullshit it was then, and I still think it's bullshit now. Nothing means anything, and

240
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,120
everything is a power struggle. That's the two most important parts of postmodernism.

241
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,000
The new young reactionaries are remarkably devil may care about certain words,

242
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,560
when they seem to lend credibility and strength to their opinions.

243
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,480
The basic bitch conservatives. Most people who are center right. The intellectual dark web.

244
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,400
None of those people are part of what you're talking about, and yet you are slandering them

245
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,600
like they are part of what you're talking about. And that is what this whole article is.

246
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,280
That is what the magical thinking of guys who love logic is.

247
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,960
Here's a video I was sent, it's from BBC Sesh, whatever the fuck that is.

248
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,080
It's a video on thin privilege, oh god.

249
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm gonna assume that the subtitles are there solely because you can't hear over the fucking

250
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:13,200
music. Happens all the time. They call it manspreading in fact.

251
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,360
Well, I'm a short fat otaku, so I never go outside.

252
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,040
Holy shit, maybe you should be- that's a giant fucking donut.

253
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,360
Maybe this is why you don't have thin privilege.

254
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:15,680
You know, that's only partially true. You can look at a thin person and say,

255
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,640
you know, that person might be healthy, or they might not be healthy, because you can't tell

256
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:30,240
other problems that might be arising that have symptoms that aren't related to their size.

257
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,120
However, you look at a fat person and say, that person's unhealthy. You can just know that,

258
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,800
because they have a problem, and that problem is directly related to their large size.

259
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,920
You cannot be fat and be healthy. It doesn't happen. You can definitely be thin and be

260
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,200
unhealthy, but you can't be fat and healthy. It's impossible.

261
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,680
Hey, everyone gets shit on the internet. That's just how it is.

262
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,960
Just try putting yourself in someone else's shoes and just look at it from their point of view,

263
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,000
how it could affect them or how it could make them feel. Not having to go at thin people at all,

264
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,920
but just simply acknowledging there is the privilege that society has unfortunately put on

265
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,600
people who are thinner. Just to combat it, just acknowledge it, be accepting of anybody of any

266
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,720
size, and don't fall into what society and the media are trying to tell us that are right or

267
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,400
wrong. There are bigger people in the world. There are smaller people in the world

268
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,200
celebrating everybody's differences. Everybody being kind to one another, regardless of your size.

269
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,760
Yeah, if you want thin privilege, you can go out and get it. You can go out and earn it.

270
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,560
It might be hard. No one's going to say it's easy. You can do it. First of all,

271
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,440
privilege is kind of a strange theory in itself because it's not quite the way that SJWs say it

272
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,640
is. However, even within that idea, thin privilege and fat oppression is completely different from

273
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,080
something like racial privilege. Unless you're going to go and do a Michael Jackson sort of

274
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,320
situation, if you're black, you can't become white. Unless for some reason you're going to

275
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,360
be a Rachel Dolezal or a Talcum X. If you're white, you can't become black.

276
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,680
It's something that you're born with. It's something that you will have for the rest of

277
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,560
your life. And now we can discuss whether that should be adequately called privilege and

278
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,240
oppression. We can discuss what the effects of it are, but no one can argue that you are born

279
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,320
with your race. You are born with your physical sex. There are certain immutable characteristics

280
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,600
about you. Being thin and fat is not one of those immutable characteristics.

281
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,720
And I know a lot of SJWs like to say that privilege can never be earned. It can only

282
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,840
be granted by society. And if that's the case, then thin privilege doesn't exist because you

283
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,000
can earn it. You can take a fat person, they can go work out at the gym for a year and stay on a

284
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,440
diet and they will look fucking amazing. One year can do it. Six months can do it if you really

285
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
stick to it. I mean, that's the reason why I'm so fat after like seven years of attempts.

286
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,520
So no, even by their own definition, thin privilege isn't a thing and fat oppression

287
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,560
also isn't a thing. Let's end off with something goofy here on comicbook.com.

288
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,040
Pokemon Sword and Shield introduces the perfect starter for Pokemon for millennials.

289
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,560
Now the eighth generation of Pokemon games, Sword and Shield, was released on Nintendo Direct a

290
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,640
couple days ago. I've always been a pretty big Pokemon fan back from when I was a kid,

291
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,480
so I'm pretty hyped about it. Apparently the game this time is set in the UK,

292
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,640
so there's been a lot of meme images going around of the main characters in the game acting like

293
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,720
rowdy Scottish people, which is pretty fucking hilarious. But this article has to do with one

294
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,240
of the three starter Pokemon in the game this time around, the Water-type Sobble. While all three new

295
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,480
starter Pokemon were well-received, it seems that the millennial generation that grew up with

296
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,000
Pokemon has adopted Sobble as its new mascot. Sobble is a Water-type Pokemon that is described

297
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,800
as a somewhat timid Water Lizard Pokemon that shoots out attacks as it hides itself in the

298
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,200
water. Many Pokemon fans, especially those who grapple with anxiety or are introverts,

299
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,160
instantly relate to this precious Water-type Pokemon. Judging from Sobble's shocked and wary

300
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,320
looks, we imagine the Pokemon probably works 60 hours a week to pay for its overwhelming student

301
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,640
debt and rising rent rates. As a Water-type Pokemon, Sobble is also probably perpetually

302
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,960
concerned about climate change and other problems that it will have to deal with that were caused by

303
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,760
the previous generations of Pokemon. Sobble is tired of being blamed for the deaths of things

304
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,280
like country clubs, terrible chain restaurants, and styrofoam, none of which are really worth

305
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,440
the money needed to prop up the trappings of the baby boomer generations of Pokemon.

306
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,040
Plus, since Galar is an analogue to the British Isles, Sobble is also probably stunned about the

307
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,120
self-destructive Gale Exit movement that seems determined to cripple the country and make its

308
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:36,000
life even more miserable. The world's problems probably weigh heavily on Sobble, and it probably

309
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,600
resents Scorbunny for posting travel pictures on Instagram and Grookey for acting like it's still

310
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,480
in college and showing up to work hungover on a Wednesday after a long night at the pub with its

311
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,400
rugby mates. It wishes it could enjoy itself like other starter Pokemon, but it neither has the

312
00:29:52,400 --> 00:30:00,800
time, money, nor energy to overcome the existential dread that keeps it up at night. It's a fucking

313
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:09,360
Pokemon. Look at these fucking soft boys. Sobble is the manifestation of my millennial anxiety.

314
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,400
Sobble really hit the millennial zennial anxiety zeitgeist and the results are good.

315
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,200
Sobble sounds like you're sobbing while trying to cobble a life together and that's why he's the

316
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,160
perfect representation of millennial dread and anxiety. He's just as worried about his future as

317
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,440
all of us. Come here sad little tadpole, I choose you. Sobble has severe anxiety and had to drop out

318
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,840
of college but still has a ton of student loans and worries people will judge him for it. So quite

319
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,560
literally this article was written by these tweets it sounds like. They just took other people's

320
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,160
tweets and formed them into an article. Anyway this is fucking stupid and it only serves to

321
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,720
re-cement my belief that millennials are a softened generation of people. Anyway I'm done

322
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,920
here guys. As it turns out even though I wanted this to be a shorter one it was still quite long

323
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,120
so here we are. I'll see you guys on Twitch tonight twitch.tv slash game boomers. I'm gonna

324
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,080
be playing Tales of Vesperia the new HD re-release of the game. I hope to see you there. Drop by,

325
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,600
say hi. Have a good day my friends. I love you.
