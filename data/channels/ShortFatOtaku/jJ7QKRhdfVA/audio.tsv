0	8620	I have to say, we live in the most fun timeline.
8620	10000	Everything is coming full circle.
10000	13780	Everything's being dredged up and repackaged, and I don't just mean the constant unending
13780	18920	flow of genuinely awful remakes of TV shows, movies, and video games that disrespect the
18920	20840	source material and mock the fans.
20840	22600	You know, the people that the creators rely on.
22600	27440	But even moral panics are being recycled now, updated for a modern global audience as well.
27440	30840	I'm old enough to remember the religious right whipping itself into a frenzy over Harry
30840	35280	Potter like 20 years ago, while the young leftoids of that era were constantly tipping
35280	39640	their fedoras and talking about edgelord atheism in their defense of JK Rowling.
39640	43780	But now the majority of those people have metastasized into socialists who are screeching
43780	46280	bloody murder at the success of Hogwarts Legacy.
46280	50700	Meanwhile, today's modern right wing is engaging in an actual satanic panic.
50700	51700	What a timeline.
51700	56720	What I'm talking about here is Sam Smith's devil-themed Grammy performance last week.
56720	59760	Now I can hear everybody already asking me, at least if you're as out of touch as I
59760	60760	am.
60760	61760	Who the fuck is Sam Smith?
61760	65160	Yeah, I don't keep up with celebrities or actors or musicians anymore.
65160	67440	None of that normie shit holds my interest.
67440	71000	But apparently he's a big deal if his Wikipedia page is anything to go by.
71000	74880	Honestly, the only thing that I personally know him for is that one of his most recent
74880	79560	big hits, Unholy, was used as the background track for like half of all the TikToks that
79560	83440	came out in 2022, to the point that I dreaded hearing it pop up every time.
83440	93160	But, okay, Sam Smith at the Grammys.
93160	97240	He performs unholy with a satanic-themed routine, makes sense considering the title, and the
97240	100960	rightoids are angry, calling it a promotion of Satanism and the degeneration of Christian
100960	101960	values in America.
101960	103840	Now, personally, I don't care too much about that.
103840	104840	I'm not a Christian.
104840	108360	This doesn't seem any more edgy than anybody else who acts profane towards a religious
108360	109360	topic.
109360	113680	That said, the edgelord atheists of years ago would talk about having gay sex with Jesus
113680	117120	in order to make the old religious grandmas clutch their pearls, because it was funny
117120	118480	to get that reaction out of them.
118480	121300	I wouldn't deprive anyone of their shock-value displays.
121300	122640	They definitely have their place.
122640	127400	Though, do you think that any of these people, these individuals who are hyper-rich and hyper-progressive,
127400	129880	would tolerate that rule cutting the other way?
129880	134120	This comic comes to mind, where the edgelord atheist gone to call me seed says, with a
134120	137040	smirk on his face, Hail Satan, hey hey hey, I'm so edgy.
137040	139340	And the normie replies, haha, hail Hitler.
139340	144000	The leftoid flies into a rage about how insensitive that is, and how evil Hitler was, and how
144000	147080	jokes perpetuate toxic ideas regardless of your intention.
147080	150300	Funny how they can pull the death of the author card on something like this, saying that the
150300	153140	message of the expression exists separately from the author's intent, and should be
153140	154140	treated as such.
154140	157740	But they don't do it on JK Rowling and her politics as it pertains to the Harry Potter
157740	160780	stuff, because there's no actual principle here, just power grabs.
160780	163060	So what's actually going on in this situation?
163060	167480	I mentioned during a previous video on comedy that progressives view jokes as a window into
167480	171120	the soul, that if you joke about something, you must actually believe it, that your joke
171120	173160	isn't just a joke, but a dog whistle.
173160	176760	Therefore the normie who jokes about nazis in the comic, who is edgy simply to get a
176760	180200	reaction out of people, is actually a nazi himself deep down.
180200	182080	That is what the world looks like to a prog.
182080	186240	Okay, so if we examine their own behavior using that lens, does this mean that they
186240	188480	view themselves as Satanists?
188480	190760	Well, no, probably not.
190760	193860	After all, the church of Satanism didn't even think that Sam Smith's performance
193860	194860	was all that good.
194940	198700	What's actually happening here is something that I was trying to get at with my identification
198700	199820	with evil video.
199820	203280	These people aren't Satanist, they're simply anti-Christian, and they're adopting
203280	207420	what the Christians view as evil imagery as a way to show to the Christians in their own
207420	209220	language, their opposition.
209220	211440	That is the point of the identification with evil.
211440	215660	Because they oppose the current culture of the West as a heteronormative capitalist patriarchy,
215660	219760	anything that the West hates is something that they support as a part of that Gramscian
219760	222020	demoralization and subversion.
222020	225940	Despite the risk of plugging myself too much in this video, think back to my recent release
225940	227420	on ugly statues.
227420	231780	The demoralization, the promotion of anti-aesthetics as a method of subversion, the tearing down
231780	236400	of quality as a component of the grand equalization and the Hegelian end of history.
236400	241180	Keep that in mind as you watch this clip that went viral from another of Sam Smith's performances.
252020	278860	When I first saw this clip, it was posted with the message, celebrating ugly.
278860	280120	And yeah, that's about right.
280120	281620	Sam Smith is not an attractive guy.
281620	284580	I mean, he was back in the day, but more on that a little bit later.
284580	288900	This clip contains all of the usual Hollywood degeneracy ramped up to 11, the sexual content,
288900	290180	the clothes and the dancing.
290180	294300	However, I can't say I've ever seen Hollywood glorify men drinking each other's piss in
294300	295300	an orgy before.
295300	296300	That's a new one for me.
296300	300900	Hey, Dylan Burns, are you sure there's not a component of the LGBTQ community that actively
300900	304220	promotes piss guzzling monkey pox degeneracy like I said before?
304220	306540	Hey, that's four videos promoted today.
306540	307900	Let's see if I can go for five.
307900	311420	Yes, it's funny to watch the rightoids clutch their pearls over degeneracy and Satanism
311460	315140	again, like in the good old days, but it's also funny to watch Sam Smith wrap himself
315140	316900	up like a ham and think he's good looking.
316900	318820	I'm here to laugh at the retardation of both sides.
318820	321420	I'm an equal opportunity laugher, but you know what?
321420	324340	Something has to have demented Sam Smith's mind over the years.
324340	327920	Back in 2012, he looked like your average boy band type pop star guy.
327920	328920	Nothing too unusual.
328920	329920	He wasn't overweight.
329920	330920	He wasn't grotesque.
330920	335100	On the fat centered podcast, literally titled I Way, Sam Smith admitted that he was a fat
335100	336980	kid who had liposuction at 12.
336980	339820	Then he developed an eating disorder that kept him thin in his twenties.
339820	343180	But as he's become more comfortable with himself, he's allowed himself to get fat
343180	344180	again.
344180	348580	One of Sam's fans interpreted the situation as such reminder that Sam Smith was fat before
348580	349580	they were skinny.
349580	350900	This isn't them letting themselves go.
350900	354500	This is them accepting themselves and being happy with their body, something you clearly
354500	355820	lack the ability to do.
355820	358860	All right, dude, it sounds more likely that you swing in between two extremes and has
358860	359980	yet to handle his issues.
359980	360980	But whatever.
360980	364640	The fan refers to Sam Smith with the pronouns they them, though, because Sam came out as
364640	369120	genderqueer in 2017, then he also came out again as nonbinary in 2019.
369120	373200	I bet if, in a couple of years time, the newest term for something like this is differently
373200	375440	gendered, Sam will come out again as that new term.
375440	378560	This kind of stuff honestly just feels like a celebrity trying to keep at the edge of
378560	379760	the progressive avant garde.
379760	383620	Like when Demi Lovato claimed to be nonbinary for a few years for clout and then quietly
383620	384620	walked it back later.
384620	386720	Oh, yeah, I knew I could make it to five videos.
386720	387720	Awesome.
387720	388720	The algorithm loves this shit.
388720	389720	Here's the thing.
389720	391840	If you told me the old Sam was gay, yeah, sure.
391840	392840	He looks like he could be.
392840	394760	But more importantly, who cares?
394760	397200	It doesn't seem to be a part of this person's personality.
397200	400380	But if you told me that this guy was gay, holy shit.
400380	404400	This is the difference, at least in part, between being a regular gay person and being
404400	405400	politically LGBTQ.
405400	411640	And it's this sort of thing that is why I'm not pro LGBTQ because it's frankly homophobic.
411640	415740	Being gay doesn't mean you have to be into crossdressing or drag or guzzling piss or
415740	416740	promiscuous sex.
416740	421480	And a large chunk of historic gay activism has been about disproving that vision of what
421480	425840	gay people are, showing that gay people can in fact be a part of a normal, healthy social
425840	426840	fabric.
426840	429920	And that's not what modern LGBTQ activism is.
429920	433780	That shit seems to be all about normalizing the most unhealthy behaviors because it's
433780	437920	against the norm, and on the left, there's a moral obligation to be as subversive as
437920	438920	possible.
438920	439920	Here's kind of what I'm getting at.
439920	443320	The lyrics of the song during that piss-guzzling clip, Don't Worry, I Won't Play It Again,
443320	447160	are Sam Smith proclaiming that he's not here to make friends and he needs a lover.
447160	450960	When asked about the meaning of that song on a podcast, Sam told this story.
450960	455320	I went on a date and the guy, you can just tell when someone's not there to like get
455320	456320	down.
456800	458600	And I was like, oh my God, you've wasted my life.
458600	459880	You've wasted hours of my life.
459880	464460	I sat through the day and then went to bed and then woke up the next morning with a little
464460	465960	hangover that I didn't want.
465960	470540	I got in the studio with Jesse and literally, I just said that I didn't come to make friends
470540	471540	on this day.
471540	472540	Then the song happened.
472540	473800	So Sam wanted to fuck.
473800	475540	The other guy was looking for something more serious.
475540	478640	And Sam therefore regarded the night as a waste of his time.
478640	482120	Now it's fine if you just wanted sex and he didn't, that just means that you weren't compatible.
482200	486640	But to regard the encounter or the other person as a waste just shows how little respect Sam
486640	487680	actually has.
487680	492480	And that very normal encounter was apparently so noteworthy to him that it warranted being
492480	494320	turned into his next hit single.
494320	498380	I don't think a person not wanting to have sex with you because they reject the promiscuity
498380	501840	of your current lifestyle is worthy of being mocked in song.
501840	505000	But it is pretty clear that modern music disagrees.
505000	507880	It's not just Sam Smith fans on Twitter that are retarded though.
507880	508880	Listen to this Zoomer.
508880	511620	It's Miley Cyrus has done this, Nicki Minaj has done this.
511620	515640	So many people have done this and what I think the difference here is, is that Sam
515640	520820	Smith was assigned male at birth and we are not used to seeing people who are assigned
520820	524900	male at birth dance around in lingerie and corsets and things like that.
524900	526600	You can tell this is a young person, right?
526600	529580	Not because of the voice or the look or anything, but because of the claim that our culture
529580	531840	hasn't seen males genderbend before.
531840	535560	The history of popular music for something like 30 years before this kid was fucking
535560	538340	born is full of genderbending males.
538340	539700	This isn't subversive anymore.
539700	540740	This is the norm.
540740	546140	David Bowie did this shit in the 80s and received the same backlash and more than Sam Smith
546140	549420	is now because he was in a culture way less permissive of it.
549420	552440	Hell, David Bowie literally did the same dumbass fashion stuff.
552440	556600	They both wore suits that made them look like a fucking angel from Evangelion at one point.
556600	557600	Listen to this chick.
557600	561940	We need to acknowledge that as a society, we've been conditioned that there is only
561940	568140	one version of sexualized and sexy that is appropriate for prime time TV and it is white,
568140	570500	it is thin and it is gender conforming.
570500	577540	And anyone who goes outside of that box will get significantly more flack for sexualization
577540	581580	and I know what about the children than the people who sit in that box because the people
581580	585460	who sit in that box turn these same people who complain about it on.
585460	589220	Where were you when Britney Spears was all, I'm a slave for you, baby.
589220	593300	Where were you when Katy Perry literally was shooting milk and confetti out of whipped
593300	595380	cream cans coming out of her boobables?
595380	603020	Dude, Britney Spears and Katy Perry received a shit ton of backlash for that stuff back
603020	604020	in the day.
604020	607380	Hell, the salt counter was through the roof when Britney Spears and Madonna kissed at
607380	609020	the 2003 VMAs.
609020	612420	I highly doubt Britney Spears would do it again 20 years later though, considering that
612420	615140	Madonna showed up to the Grammys looking like the fucking Overmind.
615140	619780	Listen Madonna, allowing yourself to age like a normal 64 year old woman, wrinkles and all,
619780	622220	would have been better than morphing yourself into a bobblehead.
622740	627060	What I'm getting at ultimately is, you can't year zero this shit and pretend that Sam Smith
627060	629200	is doing anything new or groundbreaking.
629200	630860	This isn't subversive anymore.
630860	631860	It's normal.
631860	635940	Nobody's persecuting Sam Smith in the same way as gay or gender-bending stars of the
635940	637080	80s are persecuted.
637080	641100	Or hell, in the way that drastically tamer stars are persecuted even earlier, like the
641100	642560	Beatles or Elvis.
642560	644440	Those walls have been broken down already.
644440	646500	Those behaviors have already been normalized.
646500	650260	That's why Sam Smith has to resort to trying to normalize piss-guzzling because that's
650260	651840	what's still on the edge nowadays.
651840	653600	That's how far progressivism has led us.
653600	655160	Here's the really funny bit though.
655160	656160	Remember Jack Chick?
656160	659520	The dude who made Christian comics that were kinda ridiculous, starting back in the 60s
659520	662240	but blew up as amazing memes during the early internet?
662240	665600	Part of what made these comics so funny was the over-the-top portrayal of hippie culture
665600	669400	in the sexual revolution as overtly satanic, while the Christian characters in the comics
669400	672820	were persecuted by the American government specifically for being Christian.
672820	674420	It was blatantly ridiculous.
674420	677940	Pop culture of the 60s through 2000s was never actually satanic.
677940	681760	And we all took this portrayal as part of that pearl-clutching that we all laughed at.
681760	685360	And no, the American government was not actually persecuting Christians for being Christians
685360	686360	in that era.
686360	687360	That's also a falsehood.
687360	691020	But nowadays, though, in a weird twist of events, the real world is starting to resemble
691020	695000	something like what Jack Chick described half a century ago, with Sam Smith's cringey
695000	699200	performance on the one hand, and on the other, the recent FBI whistleblower leak that purports
699200	703160	to show that some elements within the FBI view Catholicism, and Christianity in general,
703160	704160	as a terrorist ideology.
704160	706940	I don't know if this is a real document, or if it's something that the whistleblower
706940	710680	made up for his 15 minutes of fame, but if it's real, I'm legitimately stunned.
710860	714620	We're actually living in something approximating the Jack Chick future, where the satanic is
714620	717220	normal and the religious is a violent counterculture.
717220	719180	I honestly never thought I'd see the day.
719180	720260	Like I said, I'm not a Christian.
720260	723260	To me, this is just a really funny series of events, that the Leftoids have pushed things
723260	727700	so far that we're actually approaching the rightoid fever dreams of what the Left is.
727700	730920	Everyone who was reasonable never said, oh, we're going to go to that dark future, and
730920	731960	it's good, actually.
731960	733420	We all said, you're overblowing it.
733420	734420	It'll never get that far.
734420	736180	We just want gay marriage or whatever.
736180	740180	And now that it actually is going that far, those of us who wanted only gay marriage,
740180	742960	we should be speaking out against the march of progress at this point.
742960	747480	The liberal argument for inclusivity has always been one with stipulations, and even though
747480	750480	progressives hate that, it's good and necessary.
750480	754380	The idea is to bring marginalized groups into the center, to give them a seat at the table,
754380	757840	to allow them to become productive members of society, and to not simply self-destruct
757840	759840	on the sidelines with vicious behaviors.
759840	764440	But part of that deal, part of that normalization, is that they have to leave that vicious behavior
764440	766280	behind on their path forward.
766280	770460	This is why the gay person who isn't promiscuous but instead leads a stable, constructive life
770460	773700	is actually virtuous, while somebody like Sam Smith is not.
773700	777420	The former is what you'd want a gay person to aspire to be, while the latter is what
777420	780120	you'd want a gay person to run away from as fast as possible.
780120	783860	The issue ultimately is the normalization of fundamentally unhealthy behaviors that
783860	788680	damages both the people who engage in it and the social fabric itself in the name of subversion
788680	789680	against the system.
789680	793440	When the true subversion at this point is being a conservative in your private affairs,
793440	797600	it is everyone around you nihilistically self-destructs in an orgy while consuming the remains of
797600	798800	what better people have built for them.
