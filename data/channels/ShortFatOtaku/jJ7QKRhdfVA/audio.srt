1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,620
I have to say, we live in the most fun timeline.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,000
Everything is coming full circle.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,780
Everything's being dredged up and repackaged, and I don't just mean the constant unending

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,920
flow of genuinely awful remakes of TV shows, movies, and video games that disrespect the

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,840
source material and mock the fans.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,600
You know, the people that the creators rely on.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,440
But even moral panics are being recycled now, updated for a modern global audience as well.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm old enough to remember the religious right whipping itself into a frenzy over Harry

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,280
Potter like 20 years ago, while the young leftoids of that era were constantly tipping

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,640
their fedoras and talking about edgelord atheism in their defense of JK Rowling.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,780
But now the majority of those people have metastasized into socialists who are screeching

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,280
bloody murder at the success of Hogwarts Legacy.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,700
Meanwhile, today's modern right wing is engaging in an actual satanic panic.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
What a timeline.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,720
What I'm talking about here is Sam Smith's devil-themed Grammy performance last week.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,760
Now I can hear everybody already asking me, at least if you're as out of touch as I

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
am.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
Who the fuck is Sam Smith?

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,160
Yeah, I don't keep up with celebrities or actors or musicians anymore.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,440
None of that normie shit holds my interest.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,000
But apparently he's a big deal if his Wikipedia page is anything to go by.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,880
Honestly, the only thing that I personally know him for is that one of his most recent

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,560
big hits, Unholy, was used as the background track for like half of all the TikToks that

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,440
came out in 2022, to the point that I dreaded hearing it pop up every time.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:33,160
But, okay, Sam Smith at the Grammys.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,240
He performs unholy with a satanic-themed routine, makes sense considering the title, and the

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,960
rightoids are angry, calling it a promotion of Satanism and the degeneration of Christian

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
values in America.

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Now, personally, I don't care too much about that.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
I'm not a Christian.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,360
This doesn't seem any more edgy than anybody else who acts profane towards a religious

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
topic.

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
That said, the edgelord atheists of years ago would talk about having gay sex with Jesus

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,120
in order to make the old religious grandmas clutch their pearls, because it was funny

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,480
to get that reaction out of them.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,300
I wouldn't deprive anyone of their shock-value displays.

37
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,640
They definitely have their place.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,400
Though, do you think that any of these people, these individuals who are hyper-rich and hyper-progressive,

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,880
would tolerate that rule cutting the other way?

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,120
This comic comes to mind, where the edgelord atheist gone to call me seed says, with a

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,040
smirk on his face, Hail Satan, hey hey hey, I'm so edgy.

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,340
And the normie replies, haha, hail Hitler.

43
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,000
The leftoid flies into a rage about how insensitive that is, and how evil Hitler was, and how

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,080
jokes perpetuate toxic ideas regardless of your intention.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,300
Funny how they can pull the death of the author card on something like this, saying that the

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,140
message of the expression exists separately from the author's intent, and should be

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
treated as such.

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,740
But they don't do it on JK Rowling and her politics as it pertains to the Harry Potter

49
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,780
stuff, because there's no actual principle here, just power grabs.

50
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,060
So what's actually going on in this situation?

51
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,480
I mentioned during a previous video on comedy that progressives view jokes as a window into

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,120
the soul, that if you joke about something, you must actually believe it, that your joke

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,160
isn't just a joke, but a dog whistle.

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,760
Therefore the normie who jokes about nazis in the comic, who is edgy simply to get a

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,200
reaction out of people, is actually a nazi himself deep down.

56
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,080
That is what the world looks like to a prog.

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,240
Okay, so if we examine their own behavior using that lens, does this mean that they

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,480
view themselves as Satanists?

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,760
Well, no, probably not.

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,860
After all, the church of Satanism didn't even think that Sam Smith's performance

61
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,860
was all that good.

62
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,700
What's actually happening here is something that I was trying to get at with my identification

63
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,820
with evil video.

64
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,280
These people aren't Satanist, they're simply anti-Christian, and they're adopting

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,420
what the Christians view as evil imagery as a way to show to the Christians in their own

66
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,220
language, their opposition.

67
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,440
That is the point of the identification with evil.

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,660
Because they oppose the current culture of the West as a heteronormative capitalist patriarchy,

69
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,760
anything that the West hates is something that they support as a part of that Gramscian

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,020
demoralization and subversion.

71
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,940
Despite the risk of plugging myself too much in this video, think back to my recent release

72
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,420
on ugly statues.

73
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,780
The demoralization, the promotion of anti-aesthetics as a method of subversion, the tearing down

74
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,400
of quality as a component of the grand equalization and the Hegelian end of history.

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,180
Keep that in mind as you watch this clip that went viral from another of Sam Smith's performances.

76
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:38,860
When I first saw this clip, it was posted with the message, celebrating ugly.

77
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,120
And yeah, that's about right.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,620
Sam Smith is not an attractive guy.

79
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,580
I mean, he was back in the day, but more on that a little bit later.

80
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,900
This clip contains all of the usual Hollywood degeneracy ramped up to 11, the sexual content,

81
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,180
the clothes and the dancing.

82
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,300
However, I can't say I've ever seen Hollywood glorify men drinking each other's piss in

83
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
an orgy before.

84
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
That's a new one for me.

85
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,900
Hey, Dylan Burns, are you sure there's not a component of the LGBTQ community that actively

86
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,220
promotes piss guzzling monkey pox degeneracy like I said before?

87
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,540
Hey, that's four videos promoted today.

88
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,900
Let's see if I can go for five.

89
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,420
Yes, it's funny to watch the rightoids clutch their pearls over degeneracy and Satanism

90
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,140
again, like in the good old days, but it's also funny to watch Sam Smith wrap himself

91
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,900
up like a ham and think he's good looking.

92
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,820
I'm here to laugh at the retardation of both sides.

93
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,420
I'm an equal opportunity laugher, but you know what?

94
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,340
Something has to have demented Sam Smith's mind over the years.

95
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,920
Back in 2012, he looked like your average boy band type pop star guy.

96
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Nothing too unusual.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
He wasn't overweight.

98
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
He wasn't grotesque.

99
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,100
On the fat centered podcast, literally titled I Way, Sam Smith admitted that he was a fat

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,980
kid who had liposuction at 12.

101
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,820
Then he developed an eating disorder that kept him thin in his twenties.

102
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,180
But as he's become more comfortable with himself, he's allowed himself to get fat

103
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
again.

104
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,580
One of Sam's fans interpreted the situation as such reminder that Sam Smith was fat before

105
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,580
they were skinny.

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,900
This isn't them letting themselves go.

107
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,500
This is them accepting themselves and being happy with their body, something you clearly

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,820
lack the ability to do.

109
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,860
All right, dude, it sounds more likely that you swing in between two extremes and has

110
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,980
yet to handle his issues.

111
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,980
But whatever.

112
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,640
The fan refers to Sam Smith with the pronouns they them, though, because Sam came out as

113
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,120
genderqueer in 2017, then he also came out again as nonbinary in 2019.

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,200
I bet if, in a couple of years time, the newest term for something like this is differently

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,440
gendered, Sam will come out again as that new term.

116
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,560
This kind of stuff honestly just feels like a celebrity trying to keep at the edge of

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,760
the progressive avant garde.

118
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,620
Like when Demi Lovato claimed to be nonbinary for a few years for clout and then quietly

119
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
walked it back later.

120
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,720
Oh, yeah, I knew I could make it to five videos.

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Awesome.

122
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
The algorithm loves this shit.

123
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Here's the thing.

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,840
If you told me the old Sam was gay, yeah, sure.

125
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
He looks like he could be.

126
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,760
But more importantly, who cares?

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,200
It doesn't seem to be a part of this person's personality.

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,380
But if you told me that this guy was gay, holy shit.

129
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,400
This is the difference, at least in part, between being a regular gay person and being

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
politically LGBTQ.

131
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,640
And it's this sort of thing that is why I'm not pro LGBTQ because it's frankly homophobic.

132
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,740
Being gay doesn't mean you have to be into crossdressing or drag or guzzling piss or

133
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
promiscuous sex.

134
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,480
And a large chunk of historic gay activism has been about disproving that vision of what

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,840
gay people are, showing that gay people can in fact be a part of a normal, healthy social

136
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
fabric.

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,920
And that's not what modern LGBTQ activism is.

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,780
That shit seems to be all about normalizing the most unhealthy behaviors because it's

139
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,920
against the norm, and on the left, there's a moral obligation to be as subversive as

140
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
possible.

141
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Here's kind of what I'm getting at.

142
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,320
The lyrics of the song during that piss-guzzling clip, Don't Worry, I Won't Play It Again,

143
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,160
are Sam Smith proclaiming that he's not here to make friends and he needs a lover.

144
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,960
When asked about the meaning of that song on a podcast, Sam told this story.

145
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,320
I went on a date and the guy, you can just tell when someone's not there to like get

146
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
down.

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,600
And I was like, oh my God, you've wasted my life.

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
You've wasted hours of my life.

149
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,460
I sat through the day and then went to bed and then woke up the next morning with a little

150
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,960
hangover that I didn't want.

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,540
I got in the studio with Jesse and literally, I just said that I didn't come to make friends

152
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
on this day.

153
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Then the song happened.

154
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,800
So Sam wanted to fuck.

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,540
The other guy was looking for something more serious.

156
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,640
And Sam therefore regarded the night as a waste of his time.

157
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,120
Now it's fine if you just wanted sex and he didn't, that just means that you weren't compatible.

158
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,640
But to regard the encounter or the other person as a waste just shows how little respect Sam

159
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,680
actually has.

160
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,480
And that very normal encounter was apparently so noteworthy to him that it warranted being

161
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,320
turned into his next hit single.

162
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,380
I don't think a person not wanting to have sex with you because they reject the promiscuity

163
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,840
of your current lifestyle is worthy of being mocked in song.

164
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,000
But it is pretty clear that modern music disagrees.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,880
It's not just Sam Smith fans on Twitter that are retarded though.

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Listen to this Zoomer.

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,620
It's Miley Cyrus has done this, Nicki Minaj has done this.

168
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,640
So many people have done this and what I think the difference here is, is that Sam

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,820
Smith was assigned male at birth and we are not used to seeing people who are assigned

170
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,900
male at birth dance around in lingerie and corsets and things like that.

171
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,600
You can tell this is a young person, right?

172
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,580
Not because of the voice or the look or anything, but because of the claim that our culture

173
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,840
hasn't seen males genderbend before.

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,560
The history of popular music for something like 30 years before this kid was fucking

175
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,340
born is full of genderbending males.

176
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,700
This isn't subversive anymore.

177
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,740
This is the norm.

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,140
David Bowie did this shit in the 80s and received the same backlash and more than Sam Smith

179
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,420
is now because he was in a culture way less permissive of it.

180
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,440
Hell, David Bowie literally did the same dumbass fashion stuff.

181
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,600
They both wore suits that made them look like a fucking angel from Evangelion at one point.

182
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Listen to this chick.

183
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,940
We need to acknowledge that as a society, we've been conditioned that there is only

184
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,140
one version of sexualized and sexy that is appropriate for prime time TV and it is white,

185
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,500
it is thin and it is gender conforming.

186
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,540
And anyone who goes outside of that box will get significantly more flack for sexualization

187
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,580
and I know what about the children than the people who sit in that box because the people

188
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,460
who sit in that box turn these same people who complain about it on.

189
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,220
Where were you when Britney Spears was all, I'm a slave for you, baby.

190
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,300
Where were you when Katy Perry literally was shooting milk and confetti out of whipped

191
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,380
cream cans coming out of her boobables?

192
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:03,020
Dude, Britney Spears and Katy Perry received a shit ton of backlash for that stuff back

193
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
in the day.

194
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,380
Hell, the salt counter was through the roof when Britney Spears and Madonna kissed at

195
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,020
the 2003 VMAs.

196
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,420
I highly doubt Britney Spears would do it again 20 years later though, considering that

197
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,140
Madonna showed up to the Grammys looking like the fucking Overmind.

198
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,780
Listen Madonna, allowing yourself to age like a normal 64 year old woman, wrinkles and all,

199
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,220
would have been better than morphing yourself into a bobblehead.

200
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,060
What I'm getting at ultimately is, you can't year zero this shit and pretend that Sam Smith

201
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,200
is doing anything new or groundbreaking.

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,860
This isn't subversive anymore.

203
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,860
It's normal.

204
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,940
Nobody's persecuting Sam Smith in the same way as gay or gender-bending stars of the

205
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,080
80s are persecuted.

206
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,100
Or hell, in the way that drastically tamer stars are persecuted even earlier, like the

207
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,560
Beatles or Elvis.

208
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,440
Those walls have been broken down already.

209
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,500
Those behaviors have already been normalized.

210
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,260
That's why Sam Smith has to resort to trying to normalize piss-guzzling because that's

211
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,840
what's still on the edge nowadays.

212
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,600
That's how far progressivism has led us.

213
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,160
Here's the really funny bit though.

214
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Remember Jack Chick?

215
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,520
The dude who made Christian comics that were kinda ridiculous, starting back in the 60s

216
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,240
but blew up as amazing memes during the early internet?

217
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
Part of what made these comics so funny was the over-the-top portrayal of hippie culture

218
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,400
in the sexual revolution as overtly satanic, while the Christian characters in the comics

219
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,820
were persecuted by the American government specifically for being Christian.

220
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
It was blatantly ridiculous.

221
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,940
Pop culture of the 60s through 2000s was never actually satanic.

222
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,760
And we all took this portrayal as part of that pearl-clutching that we all laughed at.

223
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,360
And no, the American government was not actually persecuting Christians for being Christians

224
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
in that era.

225
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
That's also a falsehood.

226
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,020
But nowadays, though, in a weird twist of events, the real world is starting to resemble

227
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,000
something like what Jack Chick described half a century ago, with Sam Smith's cringey

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,200
performance on the one hand, and on the other, the recent FBI whistleblower leak that purports

229
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,160
to show that some elements within the FBI view Catholicism, and Christianity in general,

230
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
as a terrorist ideology.

231
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,940
I don't know if this is a real document, or if it's something that the whistleblower

232
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,680
made up for his 15 minutes of fame, but if it's real, I'm legitimately stunned.

233
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,620
We're actually living in something approximating the Jack Chick future, where the satanic is

234
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,220
normal and the religious is a violent counterculture.

235
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,180
I honestly never thought I'd see the day.

236
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,260
Like I said, I'm not a Christian.

237
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,260
To me, this is just a really funny series of events, that the Leftoids have pushed things

238
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,700
so far that we're actually approaching the rightoid fever dreams of what the Left is.

239
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,920
Everyone who was reasonable never said, oh, we're going to go to that dark future, and

240
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,960
it's good, actually.

241
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,420
We all said, you're overblowing it.

242
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,420
It'll never get that far.

243
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,180
We just want gay marriage or whatever.

244
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,180
And now that it actually is going that far, those of us who wanted only gay marriage,

245
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,960
we should be speaking out against the march of progress at this point.

246
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,480
The liberal argument for inclusivity has always been one with stipulations, and even though

247
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,480
progressives hate that, it's good and necessary.

248
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,380
The idea is to bring marginalized groups into the center, to give them a seat at the table,

249
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,840
to allow them to become productive members of society, and to not simply self-destruct

250
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
on the sidelines with vicious behaviors.

251
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,440
But part of that deal, part of that normalization, is that they have to leave that vicious behavior

252
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,280
behind on their path forward.

253
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,460
This is why the gay person who isn't promiscuous but instead leads a stable, constructive life

254
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,700
is actually virtuous, while somebody like Sam Smith is not.

255
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,420
The former is what you'd want a gay person to aspire to be, while the latter is what

256
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,120
you'd want a gay person to run away from as fast as possible.

257
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,860
The issue ultimately is the normalization of fundamentally unhealthy behaviors that

258
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,680
damages both the people who engage in it and the social fabric itself in the name of subversion

259
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
against the system.

260
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,440
When the true subversion at this point is being a conservative in your private affairs,

261
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,600
it is everyone around you nihilistically self-destructs in an orgy while consuming the remains of

262
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
what better people have built for them.
