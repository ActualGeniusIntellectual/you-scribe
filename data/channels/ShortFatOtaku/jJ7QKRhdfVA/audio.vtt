WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.620
I have to say, we live in the most fun timeline.

00:08.620 --> 00:10.000
Everything is coming full circle.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.780
Everything's being dredged up and repackaged, and I don't just mean the constant unending

00:13.780 --> 00:18.920
flow of genuinely awful remakes of TV shows, movies, and video games that disrespect the

00:18.920 --> 00:20.840
source material and mock the fans.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.600
You know, the people that the creators rely on.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.440
But even moral panics are being recycled now, updated for a modern global audience as well.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.840
I'm old enough to remember the religious right whipping itself into a frenzy over Harry

00:30.840 --> 00:35.280
Potter like 20 years ago, while the young leftoids of that era were constantly tipping

00:35.280 --> 00:39.640
their fedoras and talking about edgelord atheism in their defense of JK Rowling.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.780
But now the majority of those people have metastasized into socialists who are screeching

00:43.780 --> 00:46.280
bloody murder at the success of Hogwarts Legacy.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.700
Meanwhile, today's modern right wing is engaging in an actual satanic panic.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.700
What a timeline.

00:51.700 --> 00:56.720
What I'm talking about here is Sam Smith's devil-themed Grammy performance last week.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.760
Now I can hear everybody already asking me, at least if you're as out of touch as I

00:59.760 --> 01:00.760
am.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.760
Who the fuck is Sam Smith?

01:01.760 --> 01:05.160
Yeah, I don't keep up with celebrities or actors or musicians anymore.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.440
None of that normie shit holds my interest.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.000
But apparently he's a big deal if his Wikipedia page is anything to go by.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.880
Honestly, the only thing that I personally know him for is that one of his most recent

01:14.880 --> 01:19.560
big hits, Unholy, was used as the background track for like half of all the TikToks that

01:19.560 --> 01:23.440
came out in 2022, to the point that I dreaded hearing it pop up every time.

01:23.440 --> 01:33.160
But, okay, Sam Smith at the Grammys.

01:33.160 --> 01:37.240
He performs unholy with a satanic-themed routine, makes sense considering the title, and the

01:37.240 --> 01:40.960
rightoids are angry, calling it a promotion of Satanism and the degeneration of Christian

01:40.960 --> 01:41.960
values in America.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.840
Now, personally, I don't care too much about that.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
I'm not a Christian.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.360
This doesn't seem any more edgy than anybody else who acts profane towards a religious

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
topic.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.680
That said, the edgelord atheists of years ago would talk about having gay sex with Jesus

01:53.680 --> 01:57.120
in order to make the old religious grandmas clutch their pearls, because it was funny

01:57.120 --> 01:58.480
to get that reaction out of them.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.300
I wouldn't deprive anyone of their shock-value displays.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.640
They definitely have their place.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.400
Though, do you think that any of these people, these individuals who are hyper-rich and hyper-progressive,

02:07.400 --> 02:09.880
would tolerate that rule cutting the other way?

02:09.880 --> 02:14.120
This comic comes to mind, where the edgelord atheist gone to call me seed says, with a

02:14.120 --> 02:17.040
smirk on his face, Hail Satan, hey hey hey, I'm so edgy.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.340
And the normie replies, haha, hail Hitler.

02:19.340 --> 02:24.000
The leftoid flies into a rage about how insensitive that is, and how evil Hitler was, and how

02:24.000 --> 02:27.080
jokes perpetuate toxic ideas regardless of your intention.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.300
Funny how they can pull the death of the author card on something like this, saying that the

02:30.300 --> 02:33.140
message of the expression exists separately from the author's intent, and should be

02:33.140 --> 02:34.140
treated as such.

02:34.140 --> 02:37.740
But they don't do it on JK Rowling and her politics as it pertains to the Harry Potter

02:37.740 --> 02:40.780
stuff, because there's no actual principle here, just power grabs.

02:40.780 --> 02:43.060
So what's actually going on in this situation?

02:43.060 --> 02:47.480
I mentioned during a previous video on comedy that progressives view jokes as a window into

02:47.480 --> 02:51.120
the soul, that if you joke about something, you must actually believe it, that your joke

02:51.120 --> 02:53.160
isn't just a joke, but a dog whistle.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.760
Therefore the normie who jokes about nazis in the comic, who is edgy simply to get a

02:56.760 --> 03:00.200
reaction out of people, is actually a nazi himself deep down.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.080
That is what the world looks like to a prog.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.240
Okay, so if we examine their own behavior using that lens, does this mean that they

03:06.240 --> 03:08.480
view themselves as Satanists?

03:08.480 --> 03:10.760
Well, no, probably not.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.860
After all, the church of Satanism didn't even think that Sam Smith's performance

03:13.860 --> 03:14.860
was all that good.

03:14.940 --> 03:18.700
What's actually happening here is something that I was trying to get at with my identification

03:18.700 --> 03:19.820
with evil video.

03:19.820 --> 03:23.280
These people aren't Satanist, they're simply anti-Christian, and they're adopting

03:23.280 --> 03:27.420
what the Christians view as evil imagery as a way to show to the Christians in their own

03:27.420 --> 03:29.220
language, their opposition.

03:29.220 --> 03:31.440
That is the point of the identification with evil.

03:31.440 --> 03:35.660
Because they oppose the current culture of the West as a heteronormative capitalist patriarchy,

03:35.660 --> 03:39.760
anything that the West hates is something that they support as a part of that Gramscian

03:39.760 --> 03:42.020
demoralization and subversion.

03:42.020 --> 03:45.940
Despite the risk of plugging myself too much in this video, think back to my recent release

03:45.940 --> 03:47.420
on ugly statues.

03:47.420 --> 03:51.780
The demoralization, the promotion of anti-aesthetics as a method of subversion, the tearing down

03:51.780 --> 03:56.400
of quality as a component of the grand equalization and the Hegelian end of history.

03:56.400 --> 04:01.180
Keep that in mind as you watch this clip that went viral from another of Sam Smith's performances.

04:12.020 --> 04:38.860
When I first saw this clip, it was posted with the message, celebrating ugly.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.120
And yeah, that's about right.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.620
Sam Smith is not an attractive guy.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.580
I mean, he was back in the day, but more on that a little bit later.

04:44.580 --> 04:48.900
This clip contains all of the usual Hollywood degeneracy ramped up to 11, the sexual content,

04:48.900 --> 04:50.180
the clothes and the dancing.

04:50.180 --> 04:54.300
However, I can't say I've ever seen Hollywood glorify men drinking each other's piss in

04:54.300 --> 04:55.300
an orgy before.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.300
That's a new one for me.

04:56.300 --> 05:00.900
Hey, Dylan Burns, are you sure there's not a component of the LGBTQ community that actively

05:00.900 --> 05:04.220
promotes piss guzzling monkey pox degeneracy like I said before?

05:04.220 --> 05:06.540
Hey, that's four videos promoted today.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.900
Let's see if I can go for five.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.420
Yes, it's funny to watch the rightoids clutch their pearls over degeneracy and Satanism

05:11.460 --> 05:15.140
again, like in the good old days, but it's also funny to watch Sam Smith wrap himself

05:15.140 --> 05:16.900
up like a ham and think he's good looking.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.820
I'm here to laugh at the retardation of both sides.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.420
I'm an equal opportunity laugher, but you know what?

05:21.420 --> 05:24.340
Something has to have demented Sam Smith's mind over the years.

05:24.340 --> 05:27.920
Back in 2012, he looked like your average boy band type pop star guy.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.920
Nothing too unusual.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
He wasn't overweight.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
He wasn't grotesque.

05:30.920 --> 05:35.100
On the fat centered podcast, literally titled I Way, Sam Smith admitted that he was a fat

05:35.100 --> 05:36.980
kid who had liposuction at 12.

05:36.980 --> 05:39.820
Then he developed an eating disorder that kept him thin in his twenties.

05:39.820 --> 05:43.180
But as he's become more comfortable with himself, he's allowed himself to get fat

05:43.180 --> 05:44.180
again.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.580
One of Sam's fans interpreted the situation as such reminder that Sam Smith was fat before

05:48.580 --> 05:49.580
they were skinny.

05:49.580 --> 05:50.900
This isn't them letting themselves go.

05:50.900 --> 05:54.500
This is them accepting themselves and being happy with their body, something you clearly

05:54.500 --> 05:55.820
lack the ability to do.

05:55.820 --> 05:58.860
All right, dude, it sounds more likely that you swing in between two extremes and has

05:58.860 --> 05:59.980
yet to handle his issues.

05:59.980 --> 06:00.980
But whatever.

06:00.980 --> 06:04.640
The fan refers to Sam Smith with the pronouns they them, though, because Sam came out as

06:04.640 --> 06:09.120
genderqueer in 2017, then he also came out again as nonbinary in 2019.

06:09.120 --> 06:13.200
I bet if, in a couple of years time, the newest term for something like this is differently

06:13.200 --> 06:15.440
gendered, Sam will come out again as that new term.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.560
This kind of stuff honestly just feels like a celebrity trying to keep at the edge of

06:18.560 --> 06:19.760
the progressive avant garde.

06:19.760 --> 06:23.620
Like when Demi Lovato claimed to be nonbinary for a few years for clout and then quietly

06:23.620 --> 06:24.620
walked it back later.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.720
Oh, yeah, I knew I could make it to five videos.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.720
Awesome.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.720
The algorithm loves this shit.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.720
Here's the thing.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.840
If you told me the old Sam was gay, yeah, sure.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.840
He looks like he could be.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.760
But more importantly, who cares?

06:34.760 --> 06:37.200
It doesn't seem to be a part of this person's personality.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.380
But if you told me that this guy was gay, holy shit.

06:40.380 --> 06:44.400
This is the difference, at least in part, between being a regular gay person and being

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
politically LGBTQ.

06:45.400 --> 06:51.640
And it's this sort of thing that is why I'm not pro LGBTQ because it's frankly homophobic.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.740
Being gay doesn't mean you have to be into crossdressing or drag or guzzling piss or

06:55.740 --> 06:56.740
promiscuous sex.

06:56.740 --> 07:01.480
And a large chunk of historic gay activism has been about disproving that vision of what

07:01.480 --> 07:05.840
gay people are, showing that gay people can in fact be a part of a normal, healthy social

07:05.840 --> 07:06.840
fabric.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.920
And that's not what modern LGBTQ activism is.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.780
That shit seems to be all about normalizing the most unhealthy behaviors because it's

07:13.780 --> 07:17.920
against the norm, and on the left, there's a moral obligation to be as subversive as

07:17.920 --> 07:18.920
possible.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.920
Here's kind of what I'm getting at.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.320
The lyrics of the song during that piss-guzzling clip, Don't Worry, I Won't Play It Again,

07:23.320 --> 07:27.160
are Sam Smith proclaiming that he's not here to make friends and he needs a lover.

07:27.160 --> 07:30.960
When asked about the meaning of that song on a podcast, Sam told this story.

07:30.960 --> 07:35.320
I went on a date and the guy, you can just tell when someone's not there to like get

07:35.320 --> 07:36.320
down.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.600
And I was like, oh my God, you've wasted my life.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.880
You've wasted hours of my life.

07:39.880 --> 07:44.460
I sat through the day and then went to bed and then woke up the next morning with a little

07:44.460 --> 07:45.960
hangover that I didn't want.

07:45.960 --> 07:50.540
I got in the studio with Jesse and literally, I just said that I didn't come to make friends

07:50.540 --> 07:51.540
on this day.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.540
Then the song happened.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.800
So Sam wanted to fuck.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.540
The other guy was looking for something more serious.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.640
And Sam therefore regarded the night as a waste of his time.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.120
Now it's fine if you just wanted sex and he didn't, that just means that you weren't compatible.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.640
But to regard the encounter or the other person as a waste just shows how little respect Sam

08:06.640 --> 08:07.680
actually has.

08:07.680 --> 08:12.480
And that very normal encounter was apparently so noteworthy to him that it warranted being

08:12.480 --> 08:14.320
turned into his next hit single.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.380
I don't think a person not wanting to have sex with you because they reject the promiscuity

08:18.380 --> 08:21.840
of your current lifestyle is worthy of being mocked in song.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.000
But it is pretty clear that modern music disagrees.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.880
It's not just Sam Smith fans on Twitter that are retarded though.

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
Listen to this Zoomer.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.620
It's Miley Cyrus has done this, Nicki Minaj has done this.

08:31.620 --> 08:35.640
So many people have done this and what I think the difference here is, is that Sam

08:35.640 --> 08:40.820
Smith was assigned male at birth and we are not used to seeing people who are assigned

08:40.820 --> 08:44.900
male at birth dance around in lingerie and corsets and things like that.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.600
You can tell this is a young person, right?

08:46.600 --> 08:49.580
Not because of the voice or the look or anything, but because of the claim that our culture

08:49.580 --> 08:51.840
hasn't seen males genderbend before.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.560
The history of popular music for something like 30 years before this kid was fucking

08:55.560 --> 08:58.340
born is full of genderbending males.

08:58.340 --> 08:59.700
This isn't subversive anymore.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.740
This is the norm.

09:00.740 --> 09:06.140
David Bowie did this shit in the 80s and received the same backlash and more than Sam Smith

09:06.140 --> 09:09.420
is now because he was in a culture way less permissive of it.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.440
Hell, David Bowie literally did the same dumbass fashion stuff.

09:12.440 --> 09:16.600
They both wore suits that made them look like a fucking angel from Evangelion at one point.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.600
Listen to this chick.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.940
We need to acknowledge that as a society, we've been conditioned that there is only

09:21.940 --> 09:28.140
one version of sexualized and sexy that is appropriate for prime time TV and it is white,

09:28.140 --> 09:30.500
it is thin and it is gender conforming.

09:30.500 --> 09:37.540
And anyone who goes outside of that box will get significantly more flack for sexualization

09:37.540 --> 09:41.580
and I know what about the children than the people who sit in that box because the people

09:41.580 --> 09:45.460
who sit in that box turn these same people who complain about it on.

09:45.460 --> 09:49.220
Where were you when Britney Spears was all, I'm a slave for you, baby.

09:49.220 --> 09:53.300
Where were you when Katy Perry literally was shooting milk and confetti out of whipped

09:53.300 --> 09:55.380
cream cans coming out of her boobables?

09:55.380 --> 10:03.020
Dude, Britney Spears and Katy Perry received a shit ton of backlash for that stuff back

10:03.020 --> 10:04.020
in the day.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.380
Hell, the salt counter was through the roof when Britney Spears and Madonna kissed at

10:07.380 --> 10:09.020
the 2003 VMAs.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.420
I highly doubt Britney Spears would do it again 20 years later though, considering that

10:12.420 --> 10:15.140
Madonna showed up to the Grammys looking like the fucking Overmind.

10:15.140 --> 10:19.780
Listen Madonna, allowing yourself to age like a normal 64 year old woman, wrinkles and all,

10:19.780 --> 10:22.220
would have been better than morphing yourself into a bobblehead.

10:22.740 --> 10:27.060
What I'm getting at ultimately is, you can't year zero this shit and pretend that Sam Smith

10:27.060 --> 10:29.200
is doing anything new or groundbreaking.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.860
This isn't subversive anymore.

10:30.860 --> 10:31.860
It's normal.

10:31.860 --> 10:35.940
Nobody's persecuting Sam Smith in the same way as gay or gender-bending stars of the

10:35.940 --> 10:37.080
80s are persecuted.

10:37.080 --> 10:41.100
Or hell, in the way that drastically tamer stars are persecuted even earlier, like the

10:41.100 --> 10:42.560
Beatles or Elvis.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.440
Those walls have been broken down already.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.500
Those behaviors have already been normalized.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.260
That's why Sam Smith has to resort to trying to normalize piss-guzzling because that's

10:50.260 --> 10:51.840
what's still on the edge nowadays.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.600
That's how far progressivism has led us.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.160
Here's the really funny bit though.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.160
Remember Jack Chick?

10:56.160 --> 10:59.520
The dude who made Christian comics that were kinda ridiculous, starting back in the 60s

10:59.520 --> 11:02.240
but blew up as amazing memes during the early internet?

11:02.240 --> 11:05.600
Part of what made these comics so funny was the over-the-top portrayal of hippie culture

11:05.600 --> 11:09.400
in the sexual revolution as overtly satanic, while the Christian characters in the comics

11:09.400 --> 11:12.820
were persecuted by the American government specifically for being Christian.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.420
It was blatantly ridiculous.

11:14.420 --> 11:17.940
Pop culture of the 60s through 2000s was never actually satanic.

11:17.940 --> 11:21.760
And we all took this portrayal as part of that pearl-clutching that we all laughed at.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.360
And no, the American government was not actually persecuting Christians for being Christians

11:25.360 --> 11:26.360
in that era.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.360
That's also a falsehood.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.020
But nowadays, though, in a weird twist of events, the real world is starting to resemble

11:31.020 --> 11:35.000
something like what Jack Chick described half a century ago, with Sam Smith's cringey

11:35.000 --> 11:39.200
performance on the one hand, and on the other, the recent FBI whistleblower leak that purports

11:39.200 --> 11:43.160
to show that some elements within the FBI view Catholicism, and Christianity in general,

11:43.160 --> 11:44.160
as a terrorist ideology.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.940
I don't know if this is a real document, or if it's something that the whistleblower

11:46.940 --> 11:50.680
made up for his 15 minutes of fame, but if it's real, I'm legitimately stunned.

11:50.860 --> 11:54.620
We're actually living in something approximating the Jack Chick future, where the satanic is

11:54.620 --> 11:57.220
normal and the religious is a violent counterculture.

11:57.220 --> 11:59.180
I honestly never thought I'd see the day.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.260
Like I said, I'm not a Christian.

12:00.260 --> 12:03.260
To me, this is just a really funny series of events, that the Leftoids have pushed things

12:03.260 --> 12:07.700
so far that we're actually approaching the rightoid fever dreams of what the Left is.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.920
Everyone who was reasonable never said, oh, we're going to go to that dark future, and

12:10.920 --> 12:11.960
it's good, actually.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.420
We all said, you're overblowing it.

12:13.420 --> 12:14.420
It'll never get that far.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.180
We just want gay marriage or whatever.

12:16.180 --> 12:20.180
And now that it actually is going that far, those of us who wanted only gay marriage,

12:20.180 --> 12:22.960
we should be speaking out against the march of progress at this point.

12:22.960 --> 12:27.480
The liberal argument for inclusivity has always been one with stipulations, and even though

12:27.480 --> 12:30.480
progressives hate that, it's good and necessary.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.380
The idea is to bring marginalized groups into the center, to give them a seat at the table,

12:34.380 --> 12:37.840
to allow them to become productive members of society, and to not simply self-destruct

12:37.840 --> 12:39.840
on the sidelines with vicious behaviors.

12:39.840 --> 12:44.440
But part of that deal, part of that normalization, is that they have to leave that vicious behavior

12:44.440 --> 12:46.280
behind on their path forward.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.460
This is why the gay person who isn't promiscuous but instead leads a stable, constructive life

12:50.460 --> 12:53.700
is actually virtuous, while somebody like Sam Smith is not.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.420
The former is what you'd want a gay person to aspire to be, while the latter is what

12:57.420 --> 13:00.120
you'd want a gay person to run away from as fast as possible.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.860
The issue ultimately is the normalization of fundamentally unhealthy behaviors that

13:03.860 --> 13:08.680
damages both the people who engage in it and the social fabric itself in the name of subversion

13:08.680 --> 13:09.680
against the system.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.440
When the true subversion at this point is being a conservative in your private affairs,

13:13.440 --> 13:17.600
it is everyone around you nihilistically self-destructs in an orgy while consuming the remains of

13:17.600 --> 13:18.800
what better people have built for them.
