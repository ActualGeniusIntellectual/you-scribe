1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
The pandemic has created an unusual situation.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,120
Before everyone and everything was forced into lockdown, the bootstrap argument was

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,800
actually a reasonable one.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,040
A poor kid, even in the United States, could conceivably work hard, graduate from high

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,920
school, get a student loan, get an education in a lucrative field, pay that loan off, and

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,300
wait until they're in a stable, long-term relationship before they have kids.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not saying it's easy or fun, or that everybody would have chosen to do it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,960
What I am saying is that for those who did choose to do it, inevitably they saw their

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,460
lives improve.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,520
But the pandemic has temporarily thrown that entire path forward out the window.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,000
Schools are closed, or operating at reduced capacities.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,260
Education, and for some, graduation, has been put off.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,740
Businesses aren't allowed to function per usual.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,400
Some businesses are downsizing or closing entirely.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,160
Telling somebody to just get a job, Borisenko-style, made sense before the government forcibly

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,740
closed the doors of every small business, and placed extreme restrictions on larger

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,200
businesses and how they operate.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,840
I'm not here to talk about whether or not those restrictions are correct, that's a topic

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
for a separate video.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,200
But even if you are a die-hard believer that every single thing the state has done was

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,880
not only justified but necessary, you cannot deny the massive economic damage.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,600
The socialists are pointing at the lockdowns and laughing about how capitalism just doesn't

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,840
work, and to them I would simply remind them of the old adage, capitalism occasionally

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,280
has bread lines, socialism occasionally has bread.

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,360
But all of this has a cascading effect, which brings us to the topic of today's video,

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
the landlord.

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,240
If you somehow don't know what we're talking about, a landlord is somebody who rents out

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,280
property for other people to live in, and collects rent for the service of doing so.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,440
The tenant's responsibilities are, generally, to pay the rent on time and not destroy the

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,240
place, while the landlord's responsibilities are, generally, to make sure repairs and maintenance

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,440
are completed.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,740
There may be extra responsibilities that the parties consent to in a lease, but this is

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,060
still the basic idea.

34
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,820
Of course, you can always have shitty landlords who refuse to do any maintenance or treat

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,560
their tenants like garbage, and you can also always have shitty tenants who destroy the

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,920
property and refuse to pay.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,200
There's bad people everywhere, but the communist left has always vilified landlords.

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,480
I understood their position back during the era of serfdom because owning other humans

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,440
is always evil no matter who's doing it, but times have changed and so has their logic.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,700
Now it's because they believe that being a landlord isn't a real job, and that whoever

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,800
lives in a house should simply own it.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,560
Or sometimes they believe that houses should be communal property.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,920
It changes, depends on which specific common you're talking to.

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,760
But their criticism is the same.

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,880
The landlord shouldn't own a house he doesn't live in, even though he paid for it.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sure, if you're a reasonable person, you can see exactly what kind of problems

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,060
might arise when you have a shitty landlord or a shitty tenant, and I am very happy to

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,140
live in a country where there's a legal framework in place to deal with those situations.

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,740
If your country doesn't have that kind of a framework, I would probably be an advocate

50
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,880
for its creation.

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,620
But let's discuss a situation where the landlord is good, the tenant is good, and everybody

52
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,820
is generally happy.

53
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,300
For those who can't afford their own house, a landlord provides a valuable service, a

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,580
place to live that's quite cheap compared to buying a house and paying a mortgage in

55
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,620
the same area.

56
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,940
But even those who can afford their own house will often choose to rent because it may simply

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,320
be easier to have a landlord deal with all of the repairs and maintenance and taxes and

58
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,640
other red tape that comes with property ownership, especially if that tenant does a lot of travelling.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,120
Here's my living situation.

60
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,600
My landlord is a working class guy who scraped enough money together in order to buy a second

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
house.

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,440
He's always here to fix problems whenever I need him, and I have no complaints.

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,320
I didn't pay for this house, I don't do any of the maintenance on it, I shouldn't own

64
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
it.

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,120
In this situation, being a landlord is actually a real job, because it does actually provide

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
a real service.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,640
The socialist's reply is always that a sufficiently rich landlord can simply hire repairmen and

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,960
lawyers and whoever else to do all of the jobs that a landlord might do, and then the

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,200
landlord can simply sit back and take rent.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Yeah, fair enough, but a landlord can't hire somebody to take on the risk of the venture.

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,200
If a landlord buys an apartment building for a couple million dollars, and then a fire

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,400
burns it down the next day, not only is he down a couple million dollars, he may be on

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,800
the hook for the cost of all of his tenant's property if it turns out he's liable for the

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
fire.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,240
What socialists don't understand is, taking on the risk of funding a venture is worthy

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,300
enough of receiving a share of the venture's profits, because otherwise, who would invest

77
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
in anything?

78
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,240
So yes, being a landlord is legitimate, but like I said at the start of the video, we

79
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,920
live in interesting times, and the lockdown has created a unique situation.

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,560
Within a normal capitalist economy, the higher the velocity of money, the wealthier everyone

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
is.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Let me explain.

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,520
Let's say you work at a job, and you get $50 for that day's work.

84
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,960
You take your $50 to a restaurant and you have a big meal.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,500
The restaurant owner takes that $50 and buys produce from a local grocer in order to restock

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
his restaurant.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,700
The local grocer takes the $50 and buys, let's say, window glass to repair a broken

88
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
store window.

89
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,760
Then the glacier, not needing anything at the moment, puts that $50 into the bank.

90
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,060
In this tiny economy, even though it was the same $50 the whole way through, $200 worth

91
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,020
of labour was performed as it was passed around, and more people's lives were impacted in a

92
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
positive manner.

93
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,900
The velocity of that $50 was therefore $200.

94
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,980
However, if times are tough, you might just take that $50 from your job and save it.

95
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,660
The restaurant doesn't get its produce, the grocer doesn't get his glass, and the glacier

96
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,820
doesn't save anything.

97
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,540
In this instance, the velocity of that $50 was only $50, and only you benefit from it.

98
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,740
I'm not saying that's bad, saving is a reasonable thing to do, obviously, but if an economic

99
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,540
situation is so bad that everybody saves, then that causes the economy to crash even

100
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
further.

101
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
It's a spiral downward.

102
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,300
And when there's a blockage in the pipe somewhere, it can cause a real problem.

103
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,980
Let's say you're older, you own a house, and you're downsizing to a smaller house now that

104
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,300
all of your kids have moved out.

105
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,500
You've put in an offer on the house that you want, but it's dependent on you finding a

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,340
buyer for your house in order to free up the money to make the purchase.

107
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,300
And then you suddenly find a buyer, but that person's only going to have the money to buy

108
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,660
your house if he manages to sell his house to somebody else.

109
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,980
You can see how this situation can chain backwards indefinitely, such that everybody is willing

110
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,440
to make purchases and has the assets to do so, but nobody actually can.

111
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,480
This is why mortgages and loans are important, and taking on the risk that your client may

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,180
not be able to pay back the money they borrowed from you is why interest payments are legitimate.

113
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,260
Because the service of lending is what creates enough liquid capital to keep everyone's

114
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
transactions flowing.

115
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,260
And it's reasonable to expect a return for providing that service, just like it's reasonable

116
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,700
to expect a return for investing in a workplace and creating jobs that may not have been there,

117
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,500
or yes, for providing the service of renting a house.

118
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,940
Again, the socialist objection to this is that risk shouldn't be considered in the

119
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,940
equation.

120
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,540
If you invest $100,000 into a venture, you shouldn't get more than $100,000 back out

121
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,540
of it.

122
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,900
Of course, this means nobody would invest.

123
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,300
There'd be no point in it.

124
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,820
But in my talks with various socialists online regarding what they think would happen if

125
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,700
a business fails, their answer is inevitably that under socialism, businesses would never

126
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
fail.

127
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,980
So there is no risk, and therefore, risk should not be considered.

128
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,700
No, we're not dealing with very smart people here.

129
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,160
But if it sounds like I've gone off track, I actually haven't.

130
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,320
This backup in the pipes of capitalism, with all the houses being sold, the velocity of

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,020
money slowing to zero, the lockdowns have made this phenomenon happen everywhere.

132
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Let's say your job closed its doors, and you can't work right now.

133
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,420
You're not making any money, you can't pay your rent.

134
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,060
Your landlord's asking for their money, and you're screwed.

135
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Of course you'd be angry.

136
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,860
It's not your fault you can't pay your rent.

137
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,340
You're not some ideological communist who wants to string landlords up in the street.

138
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,820
You'd pay it happily if you were allowed to work.

139
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
But you're not.

140
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,060
Now, let's say your landlord is like mine.

141
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,560
A working class guy who saved up enough money to put a down payment on a second house.

142
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,380
He does all the maintenance himself.

143
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,840
He treats his tenants right.

144
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,940
But he has a mortgage to pay.

145
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,420
He has property taxes.

146
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,980
He has repair costs.

147
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,380
He understands that his tenants can't pay him right now, but he has his own bills coming

148
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
in.

149
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,220
Again, I'm lucky to live in a country where all the major banks are putting a temporary

150
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,260
halt on loan payments and interest and stuff like that.

151
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,580
They're basically agreeing to absorb the loss and stabilize the chain, knowing that

152
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,060
if they didn't, they still wouldn't be getting their money, and a lot of other people

153
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,780
would be suffering far worse for basically no reason.

154
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,540
And if you live in a country where that's not happening, I can see why you'd be absolutely

155
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
outraged.

156
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,100
But the problem is not, and has never been, rent-seeking.

157
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,700
It's entirely the fault of the unusual situation we find ourselves in, and partially of the

158
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,580
government for letting it happen.

159
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,180
Consider that phrase, rent-seeking.

160
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,660
It means to increase one's share of the total existing wealth without creating new

161
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
wealth.

162
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,660
The socialist conception of wealth is that it's finite, there's only so much of it,

163
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,700
and that every bit of wealth a billionaire has is taken directly from the poor, and vice

164
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
versa.

165
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,620
Again, this idea is stupid because you have to ask the question, where did all the wealth

166
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,760
come from?

167
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,060
How wealthy was humanity 100,000 years ago?

168
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,980
No, very clearly wealth can be created.

169
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,700
Very clearly you can take something, apply labour to it, and create a product that is

170
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,140
more than the sum of its parts, and that is worth more than the materials used to make

171
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
it.

172
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,180
But is there really a way to perform labour that is not explicitly destructive or counterproductive,

173
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,260
and yet still increase your share of total existing wealth without creating new wealth?

174
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,500
Is that possible?

175
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,300
Consider Arthur Chu's baby-brained take here.

176
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,140
There were no bigger rent-seekers than millennials burning CDs in our spare time for like 5 cents

177
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,380
and then selling them for 10 bucks to clueless parents who thought we were doing something

178
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
really clever and hard.

179
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,160
Yeah, you know, I remember those days, I did it with anime DVDs actually, I made some pretty

180
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,940
good money off of it when I was a kid.

181
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,260
But Arthur's wrong here.

182
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,820
Yes, the amount of actual labour and expenses required, you know, downloading the song off

183
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,180
Napster, burning a blank CD, whatever, it was quite low for what you got out of it.

184
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,020
But what Arthur is not taking into account is that knowledge, and the effort to obtain

185
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,180
knowledge, is also labour that needs to be considered.

186
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,060
You know, Arthur, you are a winner at Jeopardy, you think you would have figured this out

187
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
by now.

188
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,520
But older people paid kids to burn CDs for them because the effort it would take an older

189
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,660
person with zero tech literacy to learn how to use a computer, use Napster, how to burn

190
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,260
a CD, for some of them it was just worth paying the kids some money.

191
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,840
Convenience is legitimate service, and putting to use knowledge or skills that you have that

192
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,460
somebody else lacks is legitimate labour.

193
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,060
To consider that rent-seeking would basically be invalidating the idea that you can increase

194
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,260
your value on the job market by learning more skills and selling your labour at a higher

195
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,300
price because you can now do more stuff than your competition.

196
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,620
You know, on second thought, that actually sounds like what a socialist would say.

197
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,340
To seek rent, fundamentally, is to receive a permanent commodity in exchange for a temporary

198
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
one.

199
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,940
And what makes that transaction balanced is that it's a lot cheaper than it would normally

200
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,940
be.

201
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,940
Renting a game for a weekend from Blockbuster was a few bucks, back when games ranged between

202
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,500
$40-$100 to buy yourself.

203
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,380
Rent is often 3-4 figures a month, while buying a house often costs 6 or 7 figures.

204
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,220
A Netflix subscription is cheaper than buying a blu-ray of every movie and show you've

205
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,740
ever watched on the service.

206
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,580
Charging people for your work because you know how to do something that they can't

207
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,780
or won't do themselves is probably the most common form of employment out there.

208
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,820
Nobody who's honest thinks this is an illegitimate business model.

209
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,660
Probably the biggest kicker, though, is the hypocrisy.

210
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,220
Okay, there's a pandemic on, nobody can work, there should be a short-term bailout

211
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,700
for people who can't pay rent.

212
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Fair enough.

213
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,420
Will the radical left advocate for a short-term bailout of landlords as well?

214
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,140
Of course not, they're part of the evil landowning class, despite landlords ranging

215
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,480
from the ultra-rich billionaire property moguls down to the working man who lives in the community,

216
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,340
has roots in that community, who managed to work hard and buy a second piece of property,

217
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,600
and is likely just as vulnerable as the renters who need bailing out.

218
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,300
What happens when all of those small landlords can't pay their bills?

219
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,780
Suddenly there's for sale signs on their property.

220
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,280
And during a pandemic, when everyone's selling, when small businessmen can't afford to buy,

221
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,320
when prices are plummeting, who do you think is going to be the one buying up all those

222
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
rental properties?

223
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,440
It's going to be those billionaire property moguls that the left hates.

224
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,060
People who likely do not live in the community, have no roots in the community, and do not

225
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,560
give a shit about the tenants or what's happening to them.

226
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,000
The lockdown has slowed the velocity of the working class' money to a crawl.

227
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,140
Meanwhile the rich have been able to entirely absorb that hit and velocity drop and keep

228
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,180
accumulating wealth at an even greater degree than before.

229
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,220
With every local store closed, is it any surprise that Amazon is booming?

230
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,220
I keep hearing that these temporary pandemic measures are a taste of socialism, that there's

231
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,900
free money coming in every month, and that we should keep the system up even after the

232
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
pandemic is over.

233
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,700
But considering that this is also the system that has accelerated the bankruptcy of the

234
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,580
middle class, and enriched the wealthiest class at a rate we haven't ever seen in

235
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,020
my lifetime, I would say no, let's not keep this up.

236
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,300
However I would also agree, this is socialism.

237
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,340
Despite socialism's stated goals, it widens the gap between the elites and the plebs at

238
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,940
a much faster rate than capitalism does, and it is significantly more destructive in doing

239
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
so.

240
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,160
The irrational hatred of landlords within the regressive left has many roots, and intersects

241
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,900
with just as many other issues.

242
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,580
And I understand their criticisms, I agree, they're valid.

243
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,820
But just as it is with all other socialist ideas, their solutions are exacerbating the

244
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,100
problem, not solving it.

245
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,140
And it seems to me that they're just too hypocritical to admit it.
