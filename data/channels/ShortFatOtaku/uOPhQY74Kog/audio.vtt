00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
The pandemic has created an unusual situation.

00:03.840 --> 00:08.120
Before everyone and everything was forced into lockdown, the bootstrap argument was

00:08.120 --> 00:09.800
actually a reasonable one.

00:09.800 --> 00:14.040
A poor kid, even in the United States, could conceivably work hard, graduate from high

00:14.040 --> 00:18.920
school, get a student loan, get an education in a lucrative field, pay that loan off, and

00:18.920 --> 00:22.300
wait until they're in a stable, long-term relationship before they have kids.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.000
I'm not saying it's easy or fun, or that everybody would have chosen to do it.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.960
What I am saying is that for those who did choose to do it, inevitably they saw their

00:29.960 --> 00:31.460
lives improve.

00:31.460 --> 00:36.520
But the pandemic has temporarily thrown that entire path forward out the window.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.000
Schools are closed, or operating at reduced capacities.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.260
Education, and for some, graduation, has been put off.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.740
Businesses aren't allowed to function per usual.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.400
Some businesses are downsizing or closing entirely.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.160
Telling somebody to just get a job, Borisenko-style, made sense before the government forcibly

00:53.160 --> 00:57.740
closed the doors of every small business, and placed extreme restrictions on larger

00:57.740 --> 00:59.200
businesses and how they operate.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.840
I'm not here to talk about whether or not those restrictions are correct, that's a topic

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
for a separate video.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.200
But even if you are a die-hard believer that every single thing the state has done was

01:08.200 --> 01:12.880
not only justified but necessary, you cannot deny the massive economic damage.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.600
The socialists are pointing at the lockdowns and laughing about how capitalism just doesn't

01:16.600 --> 01:20.840
work, and to them I would simply remind them of the old adage, capitalism occasionally

01:20.840 --> 01:24.280
has bread lines, socialism occasionally has bread.

01:24.280 --> 01:28.360
But all of this has a cascading effect, which brings us to the topic of today's video,

01:28.360 --> 01:29.360
the landlord.

01:29.360 --> 01:33.240
If you somehow don't know what we're talking about, a landlord is somebody who rents out

01:33.240 --> 01:37.280
property for other people to live in, and collects rent for the service of doing so.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.440
The tenant's responsibilities are, generally, to pay the rent on time and not destroy the

01:41.440 --> 01:46.240
place, while the landlord's responsibilities are, generally, to make sure repairs and maintenance

01:46.240 --> 01:47.440
are completed.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.740
There may be extra responsibilities that the parties consent to in a lease, but this is

01:51.740 --> 01:53.060
still the basic idea.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.820
Of course, you can always have shitty landlords who refuse to do any maintenance or treat

01:56.820 --> 02:00.560
their tenants like garbage, and you can also always have shitty tenants who destroy the

02:00.560 --> 02:01.920
property and refuse to pay.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.200
There's bad people everywhere, but the communist left has always vilified landlords.

02:06.200 --> 02:10.480
I understood their position back during the era of serfdom because owning other humans

02:10.480 --> 02:15.440
is always evil no matter who's doing it, but times have changed and so has their logic.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.700
Now it's because they believe that being a landlord isn't a real job, and that whoever

02:19.700 --> 02:21.800
lives in a house should simply own it.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.560
Or sometimes they believe that houses should be communal property.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.920
It changes, depends on which specific common you're talking to.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.760
But their criticism is the same.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.880
The landlord shouldn't own a house he doesn't live in, even though he paid for it.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.000
I'm sure, if you're a reasonable person, you can see exactly what kind of problems

02:37.000 --> 02:41.060
might arise when you have a shitty landlord or a shitty tenant, and I am very happy to

02:41.060 --> 02:45.140
live in a country where there's a legal framework in place to deal with those situations.

02:45.140 --> 02:48.740
If your country doesn't have that kind of a framework, I would probably be an advocate

02:48.740 --> 02:49.880
for its creation.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.620
But let's discuss a situation where the landlord is good, the tenant is good, and everybody

02:53.620 --> 02:54.820
is generally happy.

02:54.820 --> 02:59.300
For those who can't afford their own house, a landlord provides a valuable service, a

02:59.300 --> 03:02.580
place to live that's quite cheap compared to buying a house and paying a mortgage in

03:02.580 --> 03:03.620
the same area.

03:03.620 --> 03:07.940
But even those who can afford their own house will often choose to rent because it may simply

03:07.940 --> 03:12.320
be easier to have a landlord deal with all of the repairs and maintenance and taxes and

03:12.320 --> 03:16.640
other red tape that comes with property ownership, especially if that tenant does a lot of travelling.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.120
Here's my living situation.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.600
My landlord is a working class guy who scraped enough money together in order to buy a second

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
house.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.440
He's always here to fix problems whenever I need him, and I have no complaints.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.320
I didn't pay for this house, I don't do any of the maintenance on it, I shouldn't own

03:29.320 --> 03:30.320
it.

03:30.320 --> 03:34.120
In this situation, being a landlord is actually a real job, because it does actually provide

03:34.120 --> 03:35.120
a real service.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.640
The socialist's reply is always that a sufficiently rich landlord can simply hire repairmen and

03:39.640 --> 03:43.960
lawyers and whoever else to do all of the jobs that a landlord might do, and then the

03:43.960 --> 03:46.200
landlord can simply sit back and take rent.

03:46.200 --> 03:50.600
Yeah, fair enough, but a landlord can't hire somebody to take on the risk of the venture.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.200
If a landlord buys an apartment building for a couple million dollars, and then a fire

03:54.200 --> 03:58.400
burns it down the next day, not only is he down a couple million dollars, he may be on

03:58.400 --> 04:01.800
the hook for the cost of all of his tenant's property if it turns out he's liable for the

04:01.800 --> 04:02.800
fire.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.240
What socialists don't understand is, taking on the risk of funding a venture is worthy

04:07.240 --> 04:11.300
enough of receiving a share of the venture's profits, because otherwise, who would invest

04:11.300 --> 04:12.300
in anything?

04:12.300 --> 04:16.240
So yes, being a landlord is legitimate, but like I said at the start of the video, we

04:16.240 --> 04:19.920
live in interesting times, and the lockdown has created a unique situation.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.560
Within a normal capitalist economy, the higher the velocity of money, the wealthier everyone

04:23.560 --> 04:24.560
is.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.560
Let me explain.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.520
Let's say you work at a job, and you get $50 for that day's work.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.960
You take your $50 to a restaurant and you have a big meal.

04:30.960 --> 04:35.500
The restaurant owner takes that $50 and buys produce from a local grocer in order to restock

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
his restaurant.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.700
The local grocer takes the $50 and buys, let's say, window glass to repair a broken

04:40.700 --> 04:41.700
store window.

04:41.700 --> 04:45.760
Then the glacier, not needing anything at the moment, puts that $50 into the bank.

04:45.760 --> 04:51.060
In this tiny economy, even though it was the same $50 the whole way through, $200 worth

04:51.060 --> 04:55.020
of labour was performed as it was passed around, and more people's lives were impacted in a

04:55.020 --> 04:56.020
positive manner.

04:56.020 --> 04:58.900
The velocity of that $50 was therefore $200.

04:58.900 --> 05:02.980
However, if times are tough, you might just take that $50 from your job and save it.

05:02.980 --> 05:06.660
The restaurant doesn't get its produce, the grocer doesn't get his glass, and the glacier

05:06.660 --> 05:07.820
doesn't save anything.

05:07.820 --> 05:12.540
In this instance, the velocity of that $50 was only $50, and only you benefit from it.

05:12.540 --> 05:16.740
I'm not saying that's bad, saving is a reasonable thing to do, obviously, but if an economic

05:16.740 --> 05:21.540
situation is so bad that everybody saves, then that causes the economy to crash even

05:21.540 --> 05:22.540
further.

05:22.540 --> 05:23.540
It's a spiral downward.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.300
And when there's a blockage in the pipe somewhere, it can cause a real problem.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.980
Let's say you're older, you own a house, and you're downsizing to a smaller house now that

05:29.980 --> 05:31.300
all of your kids have moved out.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.500
You've put in an offer on the house that you want, but it's dependent on you finding a

05:34.500 --> 05:37.340
buyer for your house in order to free up the money to make the purchase.

05:37.340 --> 05:40.300
And then you suddenly find a buyer, but that person's only going to have the money to buy

05:40.300 --> 05:43.660
your house if he manages to sell his house to somebody else.

05:43.660 --> 05:47.980
You can see how this situation can chain backwards indefinitely, such that everybody is willing

05:47.980 --> 05:52.440
to make purchases and has the assets to do so, but nobody actually can.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.480
This is why mortgages and loans are important, and taking on the risk that your client may

05:56.480 --> 06:01.180
not be able to pay back the money they borrowed from you is why interest payments are legitimate.

06:01.180 --> 06:05.260
Because the service of lending is what creates enough liquid capital to keep everyone's

06:05.260 --> 06:06.260
transactions flowing.

06:06.260 --> 06:10.260
And it's reasonable to expect a return for providing that service, just like it's reasonable

06:10.260 --> 06:14.700
to expect a return for investing in a workplace and creating jobs that may not have been there,

06:14.700 --> 06:17.500
or yes, for providing the service of renting a house.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.940
Again, the socialist objection to this is that risk shouldn't be considered in the

06:20.940 --> 06:21.940
equation.

06:21.940 --> 06:26.540
If you invest $100,000 into a venture, you shouldn't get more than $100,000 back out

06:26.540 --> 06:27.540
of it.

06:27.540 --> 06:28.900
Of course, this means nobody would invest.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.300
There'd be no point in it.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.820
But in my talks with various socialists online regarding what they think would happen if

06:33.820 --> 06:38.700
a business fails, their answer is inevitably that under socialism, businesses would never

06:38.700 --> 06:39.700
fail.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.980
So there is no risk, and therefore, risk should not be considered.

06:41.980 --> 06:44.700
No, we're not dealing with very smart people here.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.160
But if it sounds like I've gone off track, I actually haven't.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.320
This backup in the pipes of capitalism, with all the houses being sold, the velocity of

06:51.320 --> 06:56.020
money slowing to zero, the lockdowns have made this phenomenon happen everywhere.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.020
Let's say your job closed its doors, and you can't work right now.

06:59.020 --> 07:01.420
You're not making any money, you can't pay your rent.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.060
Your landlord's asking for their money, and you're screwed.

07:04.060 --> 07:05.060
Of course you'd be angry.

07:05.060 --> 07:06.860
It's not your fault you can't pay your rent.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.340
You're not some ideological communist who wants to string landlords up in the street.

07:10.340 --> 07:12.820
You'd pay it happily if you were allowed to work.

07:12.820 --> 07:13.820
But you're not.

07:13.820 --> 07:16.060
Now, let's say your landlord is like mine.

07:16.060 --> 07:20.560
A working class guy who saved up enough money to put a down payment on a second house.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.380
He does all the maintenance himself.

07:22.380 --> 07:23.840
He treats his tenants right.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.940
But he has a mortgage to pay.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.420
He has property taxes.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.980
He has repair costs.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.380
He understands that his tenants can't pay him right now, but he has his own bills coming

07:31.380 --> 07:32.380
in.

07:32.380 --> 07:35.220
Again, I'm lucky to live in a country where all the major banks are putting a temporary

07:35.220 --> 07:38.260
halt on loan payments and interest and stuff like that.

07:38.260 --> 07:42.580
They're basically agreeing to absorb the loss and stabilize the chain, knowing that

07:42.580 --> 07:46.060
if they didn't, they still wouldn't be getting their money, and a lot of other people

07:46.060 --> 07:48.780
would be suffering far worse for basically no reason.

07:48.780 --> 07:52.540
And if you live in a country where that's not happening, I can see why you'd be absolutely

07:52.540 --> 07:53.540
outraged.

07:53.540 --> 07:56.100
But the problem is not, and has never been, rent-seeking.

07:56.540 --> 08:00.700
It's entirely the fault of the unusual situation we find ourselves in, and partially of the

08:00.700 --> 08:02.580
government for letting it happen.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.180
Consider that phrase, rent-seeking.

08:05.180 --> 08:09.660
It means to increase one's share of the total existing wealth without creating new

08:09.660 --> 08:10.660
wealth.

08:10.660 --> 08:13.660
The socialist conception of wealth is that it's finite, there's only so much of it,

08:13.660 --> 08:17.700
and that every bit of wealth a billionaire has is taken directly from the poor, and vice

08:17.700 --> 08:18.700
versa.

08:18.700 --> 08:21.620
Again, this idea is stupid because you have to ask the question, where did all the wealth

08:21.620 --> 08:22.760
come from?

08:22.760 --> 08:25.060
How wealthy was humanity 100,000 years ago?

08:25.060 --> 08:27.980
No, very clearly wealth can be created.

08:27.980 --> 08:32.700
Very clearly you can take something, apply labour to it, and create a product that is

08:32.700 --> 08:36.140
more than the sum of its parts, and that is worth more than the materials used to make

08:36.140 --> 08:37.140
it.

08:37.140 --> 08:41.180
But is there really a way to perform labour that is not explicitly destructive or counterproductive,

08:41.180 --> 08:45.260
and yet still increase your share of total existing wealth without creating new wealth?

08:45.260 --> 08:46.500
Is that possible?

08:46.500 --> 08:49.300
Consider Arthur Chu's baby-brained take here.

08:49.300 --> 08:54.140
There were no bigger rent-seekers than millennials burning CDs in our spare time for like 5 cents

08:54.220 --> 08:57.380
and then selling them for 10 bucks to clueless parents who thought we were doing something

08:57.380 --> 08:58.380
really clever and hard.

08:58.380 --> 09:02.160
Yeah, you know, I remember those days, I did it with anime DVDs actually, I made some pretty

09:02.160 --> 09:03.940
good money off of it when I was a kid.

09:03.940 --> 09:05.260
But Arthur's wrong here.

09:05.260 --> 09:09.820
Yes, the amount of actual labour and expenses required, you know, downloading the song off

09:09.820 --> 09:14.180
Napster, burning a blank CD, whatever, it was quite low for what you got out of it.

09:14.180 --> 09:18.020
But what Arthur is not taking into account is that knowledge, and the effort to obtain

09:18.020 --> 09:21.180
knowledge, is also labour that needs to be considered.

09:21.220 --> 09:24.060
You know, Arthur, you are a winner at Jeopardy, you think you would have figured this out

09:24.060 --> 09:25.060
by now.

09:25.060 --> 09:29.520
But older people paid kids to burn CDs for them because the effort it would take an older

09:29.520 --> 09:34.660
person with zero tech literacy to learn how to use a computer, use Napster, how to burn

09:34.660 --> 09:38.260
a CD, for some of them it was just worth paying the kids some money.

09:38.260 --> 09:42.840
Convenience is legitimate service, and putting to use knowledge or skills that you have that

09:42.840 --> 09:45.460
somebody else lacks is legitimate labour.

09:45.460 --> 09:50.060
To consider that rent-seeking would basically be invalidating the idea that you can increase

09:50.060 --> 09:54.260
your value on the job market by learning more skills and selling your labour at a higher

09:54.260 --> 09:57.300
price because you can now do more stuff than your competition.

09:57.300 --> 10:01.620
You know, on second thought, that actually sounds like what a socialist would say.

10:01.620 --> 10:06.340
To seek rent, fundamentally, is to receive a permanent commodity in exchange for a temporary

10:06.340 --> 10:07.340
one.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.940
And what makes that transaction balanced is that it's a lot cheaper than it would normally

10:10.940 --> 10:11.940
be.

10:11.940 --> 10:15.940
Renting a game for a weekend from Blockbuster was a few bucks, back when games ranged between

10:15.940 --> 10:18.500
$40-$100 to buy yourself.

10:18.500 --> 10:23.380
Rent is often 3-4 figures a month, while buying a house often costs 6 or 7 figures.

10:23.380 --> 10:27.220
A Netflix subscription is cheaper than buying a blu-ray of every movie and show you've

10:27.220 --> 10:28.740
ever watched on the service.

10:28.740 --> 10:31.580
Charging people for your work because you know how to do something that they can't

10:31.580 --> 10:35.780
or won't do themselves is probably the most common form of employment out there.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.820
Nobody who's honest thinks this is an illegitimate business model.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.660
Probably the biggest kicker, though, is the hypocrisy.

10:40.660 --> 10:44.220
Okay, there's a pandemic on, nobody can work, there should be a short-term bailout

10:44.220 --> 10:45.700
for people who can't pay rent.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.700
Fair enough.

10:46.700 --> 10:50.420
Will the radical left advocate for a short-term bailout of landlords as well?

10:50.420 --> 10:54.140
Of course not, they're part of the evil landowning class, despite landlords ranging

10:54.140 --> 10:58.480
from the ultra-rich billionaire property moguls down to the working man who lives in the community,

10:58.480 --> 11:02.340
has roots in that community, who managed to work hard and buy a second piece of property,

11:02.340 --> 11:05.600
and is likely just as vulnerable as the renters who need bailing out.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.300
What happens when all of those small landlords can't pay their bills?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.780
Suddenly there's for sale signs on their property.

11:10.780 --> 11:15.280
And during a pandemic, when everyone's selling, when small businessmen can't afford to buy,

11:15.280 --> 11:18.320
when prices are plummeting, who do you think is going to be the one buying up all those

11:18.320 --> 11:19.320
rental properties?

11:19.320 --> 11:22.440
It's going to be those billionaire property moguls that the left hates.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.060
People who likely do not live in the community, have no roots in the community, and do not

11:26.060 --> 11:31.560
give a shit about the tenants or what's happening to them.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.000
The lockdown has slowed the velocity of the working class' money to a crawl.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.140
Meanwhile the rich have been able to entirely absorb that hit and velocity drop and keep

11:39.140 --> 11:42.180
accumulating wealth at an even greater degree than before.

11:42.180 --> 11:46.220
With every local store closed, is it any surprise that Amazon is booming?

11:46.220 --> 11:50.220
I keep hearing that these temporary pandemic measures are a taste of socialism, that there's

11:50.220 --> 11:53.900
free money coming in every month, and that we should keep the system up even after the

11:53.900 --> 11:54.900
pandemic is over.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.700
But considering that this is also the system that has accelerated the bankruptcy of the

11:57.700 --> 12:01.580
middle class, and enriched the wealthiest class at a rate we haven't ever seen in

12:01.580 --> 12:05.020
my lifetime, I would say no, let's not keep this up.

12:05.020 --> 12:08.300
However I would also agree, this is socialism.

12:08.300 --> 12:13.340
Despite socialism's stated goals, it widens the gap between the elites and the plebs at

12:13.340 --> 12:17.940
a much faster rate than capitalism does, and it is significantly more destructive in doing

12:17.940 --> 12:18.940
so.

12:18.940 --> 12:23.160
The irrational hatred of landlords within the regressive left has many roots, and intersects

12:23.160 --> 12:24.900
with just as many other issues.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.580
And I understand their criticisms, I agree, they're valid.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.820
But just as it is with all other socialist ideas, their solutions are exacerbating the

12:31.820 --> 12:33.100
problem, not solving it.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.140
And it seems to me that they're just too hypocritical to admit it.
