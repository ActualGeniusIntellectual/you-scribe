0	3840	The pandemic has created an unusual situation.
3840	8120	Before everyone and everything was forced into lockdown, the bootstrap argument was
8120	9800	actually a reasonable one.
9800	14040	A poor kid, even in the United States, could conceivably work hard, graduate from high
14040	18920	school, get a student loan, get an education in a lucrative field, pay that loan off, and
18920	22300	wait until they're in a stable, long-term relationship before they have kids.
22300	26000	I'm not saying it's easy or fun, or that everybody would have chosen to do it.
26000	29960	What I am saying is that for those who did choose to do it, inevitably they saw their
29960	31460	lives improve.
31460	36520	But the pandemic has temporarily thrown that entire path forward out the window.
36520	39000	Schools are closed, or operating at reduced capacities.
39000	43260	Education, and for some, graduation, has been put off.
43260	45740	Businesses aren't allowed to function per usual.
45740	48400	Some businesses are downsizing or closing entirely.
48400	53160	Telling somebody to just get a job, Borisenko-style, made sense before the government forcibly
53160	57740	closed the doors of every small business, and placed extreme restrictions on larger
57740	59200	businesses and how they operate.
59200	62840	I'm not here to talk about whether or not those restrictions are correct, that's a topic
62840	63840	for a separate video.
63840	68200	But even if you are a die-hard believer that every single thing the state has done was
68200	72880	not only justified but necessary, you cannot deny the massive economic damage.
72880	76600	The socialists are pointing at the lockdowns and laughing about how capitalism just doesn't
76600	80840	work, and to them I would simply remind them of the old adage, capitalism occasionally
80840	84280	has bread lines, socialism occasionally has bread.
84280	88360	But all of this has a cascading effect, which brings us to the topic of today's video,
88360	89360	the landlord.
89360	93240	If you somehow don't know what we're talking about, a landlord is somebody who rents out
93240	97280	property for other people to live in, and collects rent for the service of doing so.
97280	101440	The tenant's responsibilities are, generally, to pay the rent on time and not destroy the
101440	106240	place, while the landlord's responsibilities are, generally, to make sure repairs and maintenance
106240	107440	are completed.
107440	111740	There may be extra responsibilities that the parties consent to in a lease, but this is
111740	113060	still the basic idea.
113060	116820	Of course, you can always have shitty landlords who refuse to do any maintenance or treat
116820	120560	their tenants like garbage, and you can also always have shitty tenants who destroy the
120560	121920	property and refuse to pay.
121920	126200	There's bad people everywhere, but the communist left has always vilified landlords.
126200	130480	I understood their position back during the era of serfdom because owning other humans
130480	135440	is always evil no matter who's doing it, but times have changed and so has their logic.
135440	139700	Now it's because they believe that being a landlord isn't a real job, and that whoever
139700	141800	lives in a house should simply own it.
141800	144560	Or sometimes they believe that houses should be communal property.
144560	146920	It changes, depends on which specific common you're talking to.
146920	148760	But their criticism is the same.
148760	152880	The landlord shouldn't own a house he doesn't live in, even though he paid for it.
152880	157000	I'm sure, if you're a reasonable person, you can see exactly what kind of problems
157000	161060	might arise when you have a shitty landlord or a shitty tenant, and I am very happy to
161060	165140	live in a country where there's a legal framework in place to deal with those situations.
165140	168740	If your country doesn't have that kind of a framework, I would probably be an advocate
168740	169880	for its creation.
169880	173620	But let's discuss a situation where the landlord is good, the tenant is good, and everybody
173620	174820	is generally happy.
174820	179300	For those who can't afford their own house, a landlord provides a valuable service, a
179300	182580	place to live that's quite cheap compared to buying a house and paying a mortgage in
182580	183620	the same area.
183620	187940	But even those who can afford their own house will often choose to rent because it may simply
187940	192320	be easier to have a landlord deal with all of the repairs and maintenance and taxes and
192320	196640	other red tape that comes with property ownership, especially if that tenant does a lot of travelling.
196640	198120	Here's my living situation.
198120	201600	My landlord is a working class guy who scraped enough money together in order to buy a second
201600	202600	house.
202600	205440	He's always here to fix problems whenever I need him, and I have no complaints.
205440	209320	I didn't pay for this house, I don't do any of the maintenance on it, I shouldn't own
209320	210320	it.
210320	214120	In this situation, being a landlord is actually a real job, because it does actually provide
214120	215120	a real service.
215120	219640	The socialist's reply is always that a sufficiently rich landlord can simply hire repairmen and
219640	223960	lawyers and whoever else to do all of the jobs that a landlord might do, and then the
223960	226200	landlord can simply sit back and take rent.
226200	230600	Yeah, fair enough, but a landlord can't hire somebody to take on the risk of the venture.
230600	234200	If a landlord buys an apartment building for a couple million dollars, and then a fire
234200	238400	burns it down the next day, not only is he down a couple million dollars, he may be on
238400	241800	the hook for the cost of all of his tenant's property if it turns out he's liable for the
241800	242800	fire.
242800	247240	What socialists don't understand is, taking on the risk of funding a venture is worthy
247240	251300	enough of receiving a share of the venture's profits, because otherwise, who would invest
251300	252300	in anything?
252300	256240	So yes, being a landlord is legitimate, but like I said at the start of the video, we
256240	259920	live in interesting times, and the lockdown has created a unique situation.
259920	263560	Within a normal capitalist economy, the higher the velocity of money, the wealthier everyone
263560	264560	is.
264560	265560	Let me explain.
265560	268520	Let's say you work at a job, and you get $50 for that day's work.
268520	270960	You take your $50 to a restaurant and you have a big meal.
270960	275500	The restaurant owner takes that $50 and buys produce from a local grocer in order to restock
275500	276500	his restaurant.
276500	280700	The local grocer takes the $50 and buys, let's say, window glass to repair a broken
280700	281700	store window.
281700	285760	Then the glacier, not needing anything at the moment, puts that $50 into the bank.
285760	291060	In this tiny economy, even though it was the same $50 the whole way through, $200 worth
291060	295020	of labour was performed as it was passed around, and more people's lives were impacted in a
295020	296020	positive manner.
296020	298900	The velocity of that $50 was therefore $200.
298900	302980	However, if times are tough, you might just take that $50 from your job and save it.
302980	306660	The restaurant doesn't get its produce, the grocer doesn't get his glass, and the glacier
306660	307820	doesn't save anything.
307820	312540	In this instance, the velocity of that $50 was only $50, and only you benefit from it.
312540	316740	I'm not saying that's bad, saving is a reasonable thing to do, obviously, but if an economic
316740	321540	situation is so bad that everybody saves, then that causes the economy to crash even
321540	322540	further.
322540	323540	It's a spiral downward.
323540	326300	And when there's a blockage in the pipe somewhere, it can cause a real problem.
326300	329980	Let's say you're older, you own a house, and you're downsizing to a smaller house now that
329980	331300	all of your kids have moved out.
331300	334500	You've put in an offer on the house that you want, but it's dependent on you finding a
334500	337340	buyer for your house in order to free up the money to make the purchase.
337340	340300	And then you suddenly find a buyer, but that person's only going to have the money to buy
340300	343660	your house if he manages to sell his house to somebody else.
343660	347980	You can see how this situation can chain backwards indefinitely, such that everybody is willing
347980	352440	to make purchases and has the assets to do so, but nobody actually can.
352440	356480	This is why mortgages and loans are important, and taking on the risk that your client may
356480	361180	not be able to pay back the money they borrowed from you is why interest payments are legitimate.
361180	365260	Because the service of lending is what creates enough liquid capital to keep everyone's
365260	366260	transactions flowing.
366260	370260	And it's reasonable to expect a return for providing that service, just like it's reasonable
370260	374700	to expect a return for investing in a workplace and creating jobs that may not have been there,
374700	377500	or yes, for providing the service of renting a house.
377500	380940	Again, the socialist objection to this is that risk shouldn't be considered in the
380940	381940	equation.
381940	386540	If you invest $100,000 into a venture, you shouldn't get more than $100,000 back out
386540	387540	of it.
387540	388900	Of course, this means nobody would invest.
388900	390300	There'd be no point in it.
390300	393820	But in my talks with various socialists online regarding what they think would happen if
393820	398700	a business fails, their answer is inevitably that under socialism, businesses would never
398700	399700	fail.
399700	401980	So there is no risk, and therefore, risk should not be considered.
401980	404700	No, we're not dealing with very smart people here.
404700	407160	But if it sounds like I've gone off track, I actually haven't.
407160	411320	This backup in the pipes of capitalism, with all the houses being sold, the velocity of
411320	416020	money slowing to zero, the lockdowns have made this phenomenon happen everywhere.
416020	419020	Let's say your job closed its doors, and you can't work right now.
419020	421420	You're not making any money, you can't pay your rent.
421420	424060	Your landlord's asking for their money, and you're screwed.
424060	425060	Of course you'd be angry.
425060	426860	It's not your fault you can't pay your rent.
426860	430340	You're not some ideological communist who wants to string landlords up in the street.
430340	432820	You'd pay it happily if you were allowed to work.
432820	433820	But you're not.
433820	436060	Now, let's say your landlord is like mine.
436060	440560	A working class guy who saved up enough money to put a down payment on a second house.
440560	442380	He does all the maintenance himself.
442380	443840	He treats his tenants right.
443840	444940	But he has a mortgage to pay.
444940	446420	He has property taxes.
446420	447980	He has repair costs.
447980	451380	He understands that his tenants can't pay him right now, but he has his own bills coming
451380	452380	in.
452380	455220	Again, I'm lucky to live in a country where all the major banks are putting a temporary
455220	458260	halt on loan payments and interest and stuff like that.
458260	462580	They're basically agreeing to absorb the loss and stabilize the chain, knowing that
462580	466060	if they didn't, they still wouldn't be getting their money, and a lot of other people
466060	468780	would be suffering far worse for basically no reason.
468780	472540	And if you live in a country where that's not happening, I can see why you'd be absolutely
472540	473540	outraged.
473540	476100	But the problem is not, and has never been, rent-seeking.
476540	480700	It's entirely the fault of the unusual situation we find ourselves in, and partially of the
480700	482580	government for letting it happen.
482580	485180	Consider that phrase, rent-seeking.
485180	489660	It means to increase one's share of the total existing wealth without creating new
489660	490660	wealth.
490660	493660	The socialist conception of wealth is that it's finite, there's only so much of it,
493660	497700	and that every bit of wealth a billionaire has is taken directly from the poor, and vice
497700	498700	versa.
498700	501620	Again, this idea is stupid because you have to ask the question, where did all the wealth
501620	502760	come from?
502760	505060	How wealthy was humanity 100,000 years ago?
505060	507980	No, very clearly wealth can be created.
507980	512700	Very clearly you can take something, apply labour to it, and create a product that is
512700	516140	more than the sum of its parts, and that is worth more than the materials used to make
516140	517140	it.
517140	521180	But is there really a way to perform labour that is not explicitly destructive or counterproductive,
521180	525260	and yet still increase your share of total existing wealth without creating new wealth?
525260	526500	Is that possible?
526500	529300	Consider Arthur Chu's baby-brained take here.
529300	534140	There were no bigger rent-seekers than millennials burning CDs in our spare time for like 5 cents
534220	537380	and then selling them for 10 bucks to clueless parents who thought we were doing something
537380	538380	really clever and hard.
538380	542160	Yeah, you know, I remember those days, I did it with anime DVDs actually, I made some pretty
542160	543940	good money off of it when I was a kid.
543940	545260	But Arthur's wrong here.
545260	549820	Yes, the amount of actual labour and expenses required, you know, downloading the song off
549820	554180	Napster, burning a blank CD, whatever, it was quite low for what you got out of it.
554180	558020	But what Arthur is not taking into account is that knowledge, and the effort to obtain
558020	561180	knowledge, is also labour that needs to be considered.
561220	564060	You know, Arthur, you are a winner at Jeopardy, you think you would have figured this out
564060	565060	by now.
565060	569520	But older people paid kids to burn CDs for them because the effort it would take an older
569520	574660	person with zero tech literacy to learn how to use a computer, use Napster, how to burn
574660	578260	a CD, for some of them it was just worth paying the kids some money.
578260	582840	Convenience is legitimate service, and putting to use knowledge or skills that you have that
582840	585460	somebody else lacks is legitimate labour.
585460	590060	To consider that rent-seeking would basically be invalidating the idea that you can increase
590060	594260	your value on the job market by learning more skills and selling your labour at a higher
594260	597300	price because you can now do more stuff than your competition.
597300	601620	You know, on second thought, that actually sounds like what a socialist would say.
601620	606340	To seek rent, fundamentally, is to receive a permanent commodity in exchange for a temporary
606340	607340	one.
607340	610940	And what makes that transaction balanced is that it's a lot cheaper than it would normally
610940	611940	be.
611940	615940	Renting a game for a weekend from Blockbuster was a few bucks, back when games ranged between
615940	618500	$40-$100 to buy yourself.
618500	623380	Rent is often 3-4 figures a month, while buying a house often costs 6 or 7 figures.
623380	627220	A Netflix subscription is cheaper than buying a blu-ray of every movie and show you've
627220	628740	ever watched on the service.
628740	631580	Charging people for your work because you know how to do something that they can't
631580	635780	or won't do themselves is probably the most common form of employment out there.
635780	638820	Nobody who's honest thinks this is an illegitimate business model.
638820	640660	Probably the biggest kicker, though, is the hypocrisy.
640660	644220	Okay, there's a pandemic on, nobody can work, there should be a short-term bailout
644220	645700	for people who can't pay rent.
645700	646700	Fair enough.
646700	650420	Will the radical left advocate for a short-term bailout of landlords as well?
650420	654140	Of course not, they're part of the evil landowning class, despite landlords ranging
654140	658480	from the ultra-rich billionaire property moguls down to the working man who lives in the community,
658480	662340	has roots in that community, who managed to work hard and buy a second piece of property,
662340	665600	and is likely just as vulnerable as the renters who need bailing out.
665600	668300	What happens when all of those small landlords can't pay their bills?
668300	670780	Suddenly there's for sale signs on their property.
670780	675280	And during a pandemic, when everyone's selling, when small businessmen can't afford to buy,
675280	678320	when prices are plummeting, who do you think is going to be the one buying up all those
678320	679320	rental properties?
679320	682440	It's going to be those billionaire property moguls that the left hates.
682440	686060	People who likely do not live in the community, have no roots in the community, and do not
686060	691560	give a shit about the tenants or what's happening to them.
691560	695000	The lockdown has slowed the velocity of the working class' money to a crawl.
695000	699140	Meanwhile the rich have been able to entirely absorb that hit and velocity drop and keep
699140	702180	accumulating wealth at an even greater degree than before.
702180	706220	With every local store closed, is it any surprise that Amazon is booming?
706220	710220	I keep hearing that these temporary pandemic measures are a taste of socialism, that there's
710220	713900	free money coming in every month, and that we should keep the system up even after the
713900	714900	pandemic is over.
714900	717700	But considering that this is also the system that has accelerated the bankruptcy of the
717700	721580	middle class, and enriched the wealthiest class at a rate we haven't ever seen in
721580	725020	my lifetime, I would say no, let's not keep this up.
725020	728300	However I would also agree, this is socialism.
728300	733340	Despite socialism's stated goals, it widens the gap between the elites and the plebs at
733340	737940	a much faster rate than capitalism does, and it is significantly more destructive in doing
737940	738940	so.
738940	743160	The irrational hatred of landlords within the regressive left has many roots, and intersects
743160	744900	with just as many other issues.
744900	747580	And I understand their criticisms, I agree, they're valid.
747580	751820	But just as it is with all other socialist ideas, their solutions are exacerbating the
751820	753100	problem, not solving it.
753100	756140	And it seems to me that they're just too hypocritical to admit it.
