0	6000	Hey guys, Dev here. Welcome to this week's The Weekly Sip. Today I'm going to be having
7360	16720	this. It is Kicking Horse Coffee. 454 horsepower, dark, velvety, earthy, spirited ground coffee.
16720	23040	This was mailed to me by a viewer, JT Viper. He watches the videos. He's in the Twitch stream
23040	27280	sometimes. Thank you very much, dude. I really appreciate it. He said he wanted me to try it out
27280	33120	on The Weekly Sips. I'm going to try it out. This smooth, riding, dark horse conjures up power from
33120	38880	the depths of the shadows. This is the winner, the champion of taste. The one that goes the
38880	44000	extra mile. Hop on, hold on, and head for the hills. Let's give it a try. You know,
44000	48560	I've never quite had a coffee like this. Usually, like, for example, my coffee is stored in the
48560	54640	Zelda thing. The sugar's in the Game Boy. Naomi's tea is in the Overwatch loot box.
55600	60560	But I've never really had any kind of specialty coffee before, so I'm kind of excited.
60560	67040	Keurig's heating up. Oh, that's quite the strong smell to the grounds. Jesus.
71360	78160	Oh, yeah. All right, I'm back in the office. And listening back to that video, I didn't think you
78160	83440	guys could hear the rain out there. It's a pretty rainy day today. Hope you guys don't mind. But
83440	90320	let's try out JT Viper's, hopefully delicious, donated coffee.
97280	100960	Oh, based on the smell, I thought it would be more acidic, but it's not.
102480	107680	It's definitely very strong, though. Holy shit. Oh, and it leaves like a
107680	114880	like a lingering coffee aftertaste in my mouth, the way that most coffees don't actually do.
116240	118800	It's good, though. Thank you very much, JT Viper.
118800	123040	Any of you guys who do want to send me stuff to have me try it out on the show,
123680	127040	I have put my address out there. It's no big deal. I don't really care.
127040	130400	So in one of my videos this week, I mentioned Super Gonorrhea.
130400	134240	And I got a couple questions. What the hell is Super Gonorrhea? Well,
134240	141280	this is what Super Gonorrhea is. Super Gonorrhea spread causes deep concern on the BBC News.
141920	146480	Two women in the UK have been infected with Super Gonorrhea, sparking deep concern from
146480	151040	sexual health doctors. A European party destination is one line of inquiry,
151040	154800	and health officials are trying to contact subsequent sexual partners in the UK.
155680	159440	Both women have since been cured of their infections, which are resistant to the main
159440	165840	therapy. That's why it's Super Gonorrhea. It's resistant to usual Gonorrhea therapy?
165840	168560	I swear to god, thoughts are gonna fucking kill us all.
168560	171600	Both women were infected with a version of Gonorrhea that was resistant to the
171600	175920	first choice antibiotics. The cases were not related to the world's worst case,
175920	179840	which was detected in the UK in 2018 after a trip to Southeast Asia.
180480	186720	Oh, I wonder what the world's worst case was. World's Worst Super Gonorrhea Man Cured.
186720	190320	He picked up the superbug having sex with a woman in Southeast Asia,
190320	196960	despite having a British partner. Well, this is one way to find out that your man's cheating on
196960	202480	you. He gets Super Gonorrhea and makes the news. But yeah, the bacterium Nasiria gonorrhea has
202480	207760	rapidly developed resistance to new antibiotics. I made the argument in my Where Have the Good Men
207760	214320	Gone video that the complete loosening of sexual morality led to basically a lot of suffering
214320	218880	through the extreme propagation of STDs. And now there's definitely a component of the modern
218880	223920	sexual lifestyle that values safe sex. But even that's being dismantled by the SJWs because they
223920	229360	made it legal in California for people to hide their HIV status, claiming that it discriminated
229360	235920	against gay men. Basically, the adaptation of STDs to all of our various drugs is going to continue.
236720	242800	So either we find new cures or we change some of our behavior. There's really no way around this.
242800	248960	Here's something really stupid for you guys. Your fancy new brunch place is probably colonialist,
248960	256240	and you're a colonizer. Gentrification is just the latest iteration of colonization,
256240	259600	but now it comes with eggs benedict and bottomless mimosas.
260640	266800	Okay, so let me get this straight. You have a ghetto in a city and you gentrify it,
266800	270640	you kind of spruce it up. You build parks, you have like higher class properties.
271520	279440	That's colonization. In linking colonization and gentrification, you're making the argument
279440	286320	that white people just naturally live in gentrified areas and that black people or
286320	289440	whatever race, whatever non-white race you're talking about. I assume it's black people,
289440	296000	it's an American article, but black people live naturally in non-gentrified places.
296000	302320	There's no debate here that a gentrified area, property values go up, the houses are nicer,
302320	307040	the shops are nicer, the streets are cleaner. It is making a place better. And you can argue that,
307040	311200	oh, well now poor people can't afford to live there. Fair enough. That's also a problem that
311200	318160	needs tackling. But if you're linking gentrification with colonizing, then you're explicitly saying
318160	323280	that non-white people don't deserve to live in high class areas.
323280	331760	I don't know how you get off writing this article and not instantly be considered a fucking racist.
331760	336400	They call it RINO, short for River North, but those of us who grew up in Denver, Colorado,
336400	342560	it's still Five Points. Coined the Harlem of the West, Five Points was once an area of jazz joints,
342560	346640	black culture, and cuisine. A place that white folks would once desperately avoid,
346640	351600	or at best pass through on their way to somewhere else. But in the past five years, aggressive
351600	357040	big money gentrification has changed that. Today, the neighborhood brims with local microbreweries,
357040	361440	high-priced bars, and a bevy of brunch joints, where people wait upward to an hour and a half
361440	368320	for a cramped table of two. I gotta say, why can't black people enjoy microbreweries, high-priced
368320	376560	bars, or brunch joints? Is there something... is it allowed? Like, what are you saying here,
377120	382800	Simon Moya Smith? Black people can't go to those things? Are black people cordoned off to
382800	387200	jazz joints, black culture, and black cuisine? Is that all they're allowed to do in your eyes?
387200	392240	Families and local businesses in cities across the U.S. are being hurled from their beloved blocks
392240	397680	and neighborhoods as a result of gentrification, as a result of these new posh places. Oh,
398400	402320	maybe you're complaining that white people are moving into your neighborhood,
403200	408880	and, you know, it sucks because you grew up in that house, and all your neighbors were the same
408880	413040	race as you, and you all had the same basic subculture, and now when you go back, there's
413040	417520	a white family living in your house, and there's white people all over the neighborhood, and things
417520	422000	have changed. Okay, you know, I kind of get it. It's not really you're right anymore because you
422000	425920	don't live there anymore, but I get it. Now, what I've just described is something that white people
425920	431440	have had to deal with for at least 50 years, because immigration usually moves into low-class
431440	435440	white neighborhoods, and they usually slowly take them over. You know, you go to the U.K.
435440	439120	where neighborhoods have become predominantly Muslim immigrant, and they've implemented
439120	444400	like no-go sharia zones and nonsense like that, and look at how ridiculous this is. I've heard
444400	448800	for so long that white flight is racist, that as black people move into a community, white people
448800	454240	move out. That's racist. Here is white people moving into a black community. They're staying
454240	460560	with black people, and that's racist. So it all seems to be racist, all right? If you stay there,
460560	465360	and you resist the incoming waves of people that aren't like you, and you just stay in your
465360	470480	location, that's racist for not moving on, but it's also racist for moving on because it's white
470480	475760	flight, and if you move into a black neighborhood, it's gentrification. It's intruding upon their
475760	480080	space, but if you don't move into a black neighborhood, you think you're too good for them.
480880	486880	Everything is racist, it turns out, which is why if everything is racist, then nothing is,
487520	491600	and I certainly believe that some things are racist, so everything can't be racist,
491600	496480	and so these people just by default are ridiculous. That is the starting point for
496480	501680	this conversation. I saw this when I lived in Brooklyn in 2015, just up the block from my
501680	506560	cramped roach-packed apartment in a neighborhood long known as Sunset Park. The local grocer,
506560	511760	a neighborhood staple, has announced it was shuttering after 36 years. In the 70s and 80s,
511760	515440	the former owners would pay the mafia $500 a week to stay in operation,
515440	519920	but by 2015, the needs and desires of the hipster kind became too much.
520720	524320	The hipsters are more demanding than the mafia, my then girlfriend said at the time.
524320	526880	There's a difference here. There's an obvious difference. In fact, there's a few obvious
526880	532480	differences. One, why would you want to continue living in a cramped roach-packed apartment?
533280	539120	Why wouldn't you like that place to be fixed up a little bit? Two, the hipsters don't demand more
539120	544400	than the mafia. The mafia demanded $500 a week just to exist. The hipsters just didn't shop at
544400	552160	an old-style grocer. That's it. I also made a point in a previous video that a lot of these SJWs
552160	558320	equated white culture with success and black culture with stagnation. I remember saying that,
558320	562800	and I still kind of believe that. That's why you get black people who are successful. They're
562800	570320	called not black enough, or they're told that they act like whitey. Maybe this is it. Maybe
570320	575440	the fact that this person does not want their cramped roach-packed apartment to be fixed up
575440	582800	or replaced with a better apartment or something else is part of this. I understand not having much
582800	588560	but being proud of what you have, but you can't let that get in the way of improving your situation,
588560	593040	can you? I mean, if you do, you end up like America's black community, where for a long
593040	598320	time now they've stagnated and they've refused to improve because it's their culture, it's their
598320	603120	way of life, it's their thing, and acting in an objectively better way to them is acting white.
603680	607120	It's nonsense, and this article's nonsense. Check out this ending, though.
608000	613760	There is no immediate solution to the scourge of gentrification, mainly because we lived in a
613840	620560	rigged cor-corpocracy and an evil oligarchy. But maybe, just maybe, I said this in a previous
620560	625040	episode. If someone ever writes that phrase, instantly discount their opinion because they
625040	632400	don't fucking get it. And yeah, it turns out I was right. Diva was right all along. Enjoy your brunch.
632400	638160	I will. I will enjoy my brunch. Thank you. Thank you, Simon Moya Smith. Fuck you. So I saw this
638160	644400	picture floating around, and in it there's five new stories, but all quite old, in fact. They're
644400	652000	from between 2012 and 2017, but this picture is relatively new. And it kind of made me laugh. It's
652000	660640	as the story gets stupider, the Wojak also gets stupider. I love the retarded Wojaks.
660640	664320	There's the one with the guy whose head is a bicycle, or like a hamster wheel.
665280	668240	But I decided to look up these five stories and actually see what they were all about.
668240	673040	This is on aboutislam.net. Do you know that the U.S. liberty statue represented a Muslim woman?
675600	680000	Really? Early models of the statue were called Egypt carrying the light to Asia.
680000	684640	It was meant to be a female Egyptian peasant as a colossus of Rhodes for the industrial age.
685200	689200	You know, fair enough. You can kind of see the resemblance to the colossus of Rhodes, right?
689200	692640	However, the U.S. liberty statue does not represent a Muslim woman.
693520	698880	It was originally supposed to be a Muslim woman, but it is not one now. And I think that people
698880	704560	started pushing this story because it became politically relevant to do so. Maybe there's
704560	709200	a point to be made that the Statue of Liberty was originally planned to be a Muslim woman,
709200	715440	Egypt carrying the light to Asia. However, there is also a point to be made that it ended up not
715440	720960	being a Muslim woman. But let's check out the second article on this list here. Why kids love
721280	728640	fascist cartoons like Paw Patrol and Thomas? What what makes them fash? This has to be
728640	734000	this has to be a joke. It's not April 1st, but it has to be a joke. People like to see themselves
734000	737760	as purveyors of possibility. We want our children to inhabit a world in which identities are both
737760	743200	mutable and equal and imagination and empathy reign supreme. But children, as dictated by
743200	747360	their tastes in popular culture, have something else in mind. They're drawn to worlds in which
747360	752160	identities are fixed. Order trumps imagination and transgressions are met with routine punishment.
752160	758880	What? Is this is quite literally an old person complaining about what the kids today like?
758880	762880	This clash between what parents desire for their children and what children desire for themselves
762880	768000	is most easily observable in cartoon preferences. So often, the more parents like a show,
768000	772400	the more the children love it. Two of the most divisive shows are Thomas the Tank Engine and
772400	777200	Paw Patrol, both of which have been eviscerated by grownups and discussion boards.
777200	782480	Don't your kids understand the evisceration that grownups have given these shows on internet
782480	786720	discussion boards? Thomas, the long-running television franchise about a group of working
786720	791840	trains chugging away in the island of Sodor, has been called a pre-modern corporate totalitarian
791840	797600	dystopia in The New Yorker, imperialist and sinister and slate, and classist, sexist and
797600	803600	anti-environmentalist in The Guardian. And yet people, presumably parents, spend one billion
803600	808400	dollars on Thomas merchandise every year. Parents, how could you? How could you do this
808400	813520	to your kids? How could you do this to yourselves? But most importantly, how could you do this to
813520	818880	your journalist ruling betters? The New Yorker, Slate, and The Guardian have all told you what
818880	824000	you should be doing and thinking, and you have refused. You have refused to listen to them to
824000	830240	the tune of one billion dollars a year. How could you? Even Buzzfeed called the show terrible and
830320	835520	pointed to instances of gender and social inequality. How could you not understand?
835520	840800	Rage as we might, these shows are a source of comfort for our young children, whose id-driven
840800	846400	brains seek out the order, stability, and even punishment in their entertainment. You know,
848480	855680	order, stability, and sometimes even punishment are not negative things. I know for some reason
856160	861680	you hate the concept of order, but it is very important and not all order is fascist,
861680	866400	even though you slapped fascism into the title of this article. You haven't even brought fascism up
866400	872320	yet. Where is it? Where's the fascism? Hold on. So as it turns out, there's only three uses of
872320	880960	the word fascist in this article. One is in the top bar where the title is repeated. One is in
880960	889040	the title itself. And the third one is here. This woman has no qualms letting her four-year-old
889040	893680	watch Thomas, which is his favorite thing in the entire world. I think it's evolved a lot over the
893680	900800	years, which is why I don't really agree with the fascist label. But that seems to be it. That's the
900800	912720	only... is there anything like fascism? No. Is Nazi in here? No. Totalitarians in here once.
914800	919760	So the only thing that makes these cartoons fascist is that your peers have called them
919760	925600	fascist. This has to be the most worthless article I have ever presented on this show.
925600	931360	Let's check out the middle one though. Women's March expected to be the largest gathering of
931360	942480	people with disabilities in US history. Oh boy. Dude, she skipped leg day. Okay, that was a really
942480	948320	bad joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What happens when a man who now has the keys to the
948320	952880	highest office openly mock people with disabilities? They fight back. Didn't the
952880	959920	Women's March fall apart? I've had a back burner video kind of brewing for a while about just the
959920	964240	beginning and end of the Women's March. Maybe I should do it sometime soon. And yeah, this article
964240	969040	seems to be nothing but just talking about how they didn't like that Trump did that whole hand
969040	977280	hitting his chest imitation of a disabled person. Which yeah, that was pretty rude. But it seems
977280	981280	like something a teenage boy would do, because it's something that many teenage boys, including
981280	985760	myself, did when we were teenagers. Or even when we were younger than that, even when we were 12
985760	991520	or something. If we wanted to make fun of one of the disabled kids in the special ed classes in the
991520	997600	school, we would do that. And I'm not saying it's good. I'm not saying it's proper. I wouldn't do it
997600	1002720	in polite company. I probably wouldn't do it as an adult anymore. I was a dumb kid. And the fact that
1002720	1008240	Trump did it as an adult kind of makes him look stupid. But that's really it, isn't it? It doesn't
1008240	1012480	delegitimize him as president. It doesn't mean that his other speeches are all inherently bad.
1012480	1016400	It doesn't mean that his policies or the work that he's done is all bad. It just makes him
1016400	1021360	an insensitive asshole. And I don't think people elected him for him to be nice. We're going down
1021360	1027040	the list here. Americans who practice yoga contribute to white supremacy. You know, I've
1027040	1032480	seen this claim made before. I think I talked about it in one of the How Cucked Us Canada videos,
1032480	1038720	where there was a yoga class in Ottawa that was... People tried to shut it down because it was
1038720	1045600	run by white people. And they said it was cultural appropriation. And then they went to a temple
1045600	1049440	in Ottawa. And they said, hey, do you think that white people practicing yoga is cultural
1049440	1054160	appropriation? And they said, no, it's fine. It's happy that you guys are spreading and enjoying
1054160	1059520	our culture. Just like we're here in Canada and we're enjoying yours. Cultural appropriation has
1059520	1064480	always been dumb because cultures have always mingled. It's stupid. White people who do a
1064480	1068320	downward facing dog are contributing to a system of power, privilege, and oppression.
1070080	1074320	Yeah, I'm sure they are. Sharina Gandhi. Are you related to the actual Gandhi?
1074320	1078480	A religious studies professor at Michigan State claims in an article she recently co-authored
1078480	1082320	that Americans who practice yoga are contributing to white supremacy and promote the yoga
1082320	1090720	industrial complex. Yoga industrial complex? Are you fucking kidding me?
1091440	1095120	Okay, what's this article that she wrote? Hold on a minute. The Praxis Centre,
1095120	1102080	Arcus Centre for Social Justice Leadership. Yoga and the roots of cultural appropriation.
1102720	1109840	Hold on. Sharina Gandhi and Lily Wolf? These can't be their real names. They must have changed
1109840	1115920	their names to imitate influential figures. There's no way. Yoga's popularity was a direct
1115920	1120160	consequence of a larger system of cultural appropriation that capitalism engenders and
1120160	1124880	reifies. While the misappropriation of yoga may not be a life threatening racist,
1125840	1129600	it is part of systemic racism nonetheless. And it is important to ask what are the
1129600	1134240	impetuses for this cultural grabbing? Maybe it's because yoga is healthy and there are
1134320	1140400	people who want to be healthy and so they are willing in fact to go cross culture to gleam
1140400	1145360	bits of useful information and practices from multiple different cultures to create a healthy
1145360	1152400	lifestyle because no culture is perfect, obviously. Oh god. How to decolonize your yoga practice.
1152400	1157040	Okay, show me open democracy. How do I fucking decolonize my yoga practice?
1158080	1162400	I've gone down like a link hole it seems. This is basically just me link surfing on the show now.
1162400	1168560	Oh, 404 page number. We can't do it, can we? I guess we just can't decolonize yoga. Fuck you.
1168560	1174240	Racism, ahimsa, and yoga in the face of inequality. What would you know about a white girl?
1174240	1180480	Like, hold on. You're a white girl, aren't you? Oh, you might be mixed. You might be half white,
1180480	1185040	half Asian. I have to know. I have to know if you're a racist. I have to know.
1185040	1188400	Walnut Creek, California. Why am I not fucking surprised?
1188800	1193440	Oh, and it turns out that her progressivism has rewarded her with a Netflix show.
1194240	1198800	All about yoga. I wonder if you're part of the problem here. The final one appears to be
1198800	1206880	a picture of a TV with the headline PB&J sandwiches. Are they racist?
1207840	1213840	I couldn't find this specific clip, but I do have this. Peanut butter and jelly racist?
1214640	1220400	Portland School Principal. Of course it's fucking Portland. Ties sandwich to white privilege. This
1220400	1225520	is back from 2012, so it's pretty old, but still, it's fucking stupid, isn't it? And of course it
1225520	1230000	would be Portland. Portland 2012 is like the rest of the world 2019, it seems.
1230000	1234480	The sandwich has broader implications about race. No, it doesn't. It's a fucking sandwich.
1234480	1237280	The sandwich was reportedly mentioned in a lesson plan last year.
1237280	1240480	A teacher used it as an example of a subtle form of racism in language.
1241440	1244720	What about Somali or Hispanic students who might not eat sandwiches?
1244720	1249040	Another way would be to say Americans eat peanut butter and jelly. Do you have anything like that?
1249040	1254960	Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta or pita. Who cares? This isn't a fucking buffet.
1254960	1261360	It's a cafeteria. Eat your sandwich. Bring your own lunch. Go somewhere else. Like,
1261360	1265120	imagine the fucking entitlement you have to have, the chip on your shoulder, to walk into
1265120	1270960	a cafeteria. Look at the selections and say, no, I want something else. You're going to make
1270960	1277280	me something else. And it's racist that you don't, and it's racist that you don't already
1277280	1282800	have alternatives to begin with. Fuck you. One refreshing thing about this article is
1282800	1286400	that because it was written in 2012, the part of the article that talks about regular people
1286400	1292080	on Twitter mocking the whole story is simply presented straight. It's not twisted in such a
1292080	1297520	way that your average Joe on Twitter is painted as a racist for not taking this deathly seriously
1297520	1302960	like it is in 2019. What's the verdict on grilled cheese? Racist? Sexist? All sandwiches are racist.
1302960	1307040	It's the name sandwich the poor tortas are discriminated against. Yeah, see, this sounds
1307040	1313840	like just shit posters, right? And in 2019, you would get a warning for this stuff. But in 2012,
1313840	1324160	it's all good fun. Let's go back, guys, please. Let's just go back. 2012 YouTube, 2012 Twitch.
1324880	1329760	It was just a better internet all around. That does it for me, guys. I know that it wasn't
1329760	1334640	necessarily up-to-date articles, but I think it was fun to have a little dive into the past there.
1334640	1340400	Thank you very much, JT Viper, for the coffee. It is quite delicious. Speaking of 2012 Twitch,
1340400	1345840	when I stream on my Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, I basically treat it like
1345840	1350560	it's 2012. Whenever I do gaming content on the internet, I treat it like it's between
1350560	1357600	2009 and 2012. The modern golden age of video games. It wasn't quite as good as the actual
1357600	1363120	golden age like the Super Nintendo and 64 era, but it was still pretty good. The Wii PS3 360
1363120	1368000	generation was was quite a lot of fun in my opinion. I bring all that up because I am in fact
1368000	1375760	streaming tonight. It'll be me and three other friends piling onto a coach and playing Tales of
1375760	1383680	Vesperia, which surprise, surprise, I think is a 2011 era 360 JRPG that has been re-released
1383680	1388320	on the PS4 and like a high definition quality. And we've been making our way through the story
1388320	1393200	mode of that game as a four player group. So we'll be doing that tonight. Drop by, say hi,
1393200	1398240	I'd love to see you there. I'm actually still working on the 50,000 sub video. I know it's
1398240	1402880	been like a month, but I've kind of had, I've had something planned that I needed to wait for some
1402880	1408400	props to come in for. And so I will be able to get that out to you maybe in the next two weeks
1408400	1415040	or so. Of course, I'll try to keep on the daily videos as well. As for D and D Sargon says it's
1415040	1420800	up this this week on Wednesday. So let's hope guys. Anyway, I'm getting out of here. Hope to
1420800	1423040	see you guys at the stream tonight. I love you.
