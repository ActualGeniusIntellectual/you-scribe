00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hey guys, Dev here. Welcome to this week's The Weekly Sip. Today I'm going to be having

00:07.360 --> 00:16.720
this. It is Kicking Horse Coffee. 454 horsepower, dark, velvety, earthy, spirited ground coffee.

00:16.720 --> 00:23.040
This was mailed to me by a viewer, JT Viper. He watches the videos. He's in the Twitch stream

00:23.040 --> 00:27.280
sometimes. Thank you very much, dude. I really appreciate it. He said he wanted me to try it out

00:27.280 --> 00:33.120
on The Weekly Sips. I'm going to try it out. This smooth, riding, dark horse conjures up power from

00:33.120 --> 00:38.880
the depths of the shadows. This is the winner, the champion of taste. The one that goes the

00:38.880 --> 00:44.000
extra mile. Hop on, hold on, and head for the hills. Let's give it a try. You know,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.560
I've never quite had a coffee like this. Usually, like, for example, my coffee is stored in the

00:48.560 --> 00:54.640
Zelda thing. The sugar's in the Game Boy. Naomi's tea is in the Overwatch loot box.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.560
But I've never really had any kind of specialty coffee before, so I'm kind of excited.

01:00.560 --> 01:07.040
Keurig's heating up. Oh, that's quite the strong smell to the grounds. Jesus.

01:11.360 --> 01:18.160
Oh, yeah. All right, I'm back in the office. And listening back to that video, I didn't think you

01:18.160 --> 01:23.440
guys could hear the rain out there. It's a pretty rainy day today. Hope you guys don't mind. But

01:23.440 --> 01:30.320
let's try out JT Viper's, hopefully delicious, donated coffee.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.960
Oh, based on the smell, I thought it would be more acidic, but it's not.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.680
It's definitely very strong, though. Holy shit. Oh, and it leaves like a

01:47.680 --> 01:54.880
like a lingering coffee aftertaste in my mouth, the way that most coffees don't actually do.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.800
It's good, though. Thank you very much, JT Viper.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.040
Any of you guys who do want to send me stuff to have me try it out on the show,

02:03.680 --> 02:07.040
I have put my address out there. It's no big deal. I don't really care.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.400
So in one of my videos this week, I mentioned Super Gonorrhea.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.240
And I got a couple questions. What the hell is Super Gonorrhea? Well,

02:14.240 --> 02:21.280
this is what Super Gonorrhea is. Super Gonorrhea spread causes deep concern on the BBC News.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.480
Two women in the UK have been infected with Super Gonorrhea, sparking deep concern from

02:26.480 --> 02:31.040
sexual health doctors. A European party destination is one line of inquiry,

02:31.040 --> 02:34.800
and health officials are trying to contact subsequent sexual partners in the UK.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.440
Both women have since been cured of their infections, which are resistant to the main

02:39.440 --> 02:45.840
therapy. That's why it's Super Gonorrhea. It's resistant to usual Gonorrhea therapy?

02:45.840 --> 02:48.560
I swear to god, thoughts are gonna fucking kill us all.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.600
Both women were infected with a version of Gonorrhea that was resistant to the

02:51.600 --> 02:55.920
first choice antibiotics. The cases were not related to the world's worst case,

02:55.920 --> 02:59.840
which was detected in the UK in 2018 after a trip to Southeast Asia.

03:00.480 --> 03:06.720
Oh, I wonder what the world's worst case was. World's Worst Super Gonorrhea Man Cured.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.320
He picked up the superbug having sex with a woman in Southeast Asia,

03:10.320 --> 03:16.960
despite having a British partner. Well, this is one way to find out that your man's cheating on

03:16.960 --> 03:22.480
you. He gets Super Gonorrhea and makes the news. But yeah, the bacterium Nasiria gonorrhea has

03:22.480 --> 03:27.760
rapidly developed resistance to new antibiotics. I made the argument in my Where Have the Good Men

03:27.760 --> 03:34.320
Gone video that the complete loosening of sexual morality led to basically a lot of suffering

03:34.320 --> 03:38.880
through the extreme propagation of STDs. And now there's definitely a component of the modern

03:38.880 --> 03:43.920
sexual lifestyle that values safe sex. But even that's being dismantled by the SJWs because they

03:43.920 --> 03:49.360
made it legal in California for people to hide their HIV status, claiming that it discriminated

03:49.360 --> 03:55.920
against gay men. Basically, the adaptation of STDs to all of our various drugs is going to continue.

03:56.720 --> 04:02.800
So either we find new cures or we change some of our behavior. There's really no way around this.

04:02.800 --> 04:08.960
Here's something really stupid for you guys. Your fancy new brunch place is probably colonialist,

04:08.960 --> 04:16.240
and you're a colonizer. Gentrification is just the latest iteration of colonization,

04:16.240 --> 04:19.600
but now it comes with eggs benedict and bottomless mimosas.

04:20.640 --> 04:26.800
Okay, so let me get this straight. You have a ghetto in a city and you gentrify it,

04:26.800 --> 04:30.640
you kind of spruce it up. You build parks, you have like higher class properties.

04:31.520 --> 04:39.440
That's colonization. In linking colonization and gentrification, you're making the argument

04:39.440 --> 04:46.320
that white people just naturally live in gentrified areas and that black people or

04:46.320 --> 04:49.440
whatever race, whatever non-white race you're talking about. I assume it's black people,

04:49.440 --> 04:56.000
it's an American article, but black people live naturally in non-gentrified places.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.320
There's no debate here that a gentrified area, property values go up, the houses are nicer,

05:02.320 --> 05:07.040
the shops are nicer, the streets are cleaner. It is making a place better. And you can argue that,

05:07.040 --> 05:11.200
oh, well now poor people can't afford to live there. Fair enough. That's also a problem that

05:11.200 --> 05:18.160
needs tackling. But if you're linking gentrification with colonizing, then you're explicitly saying

05:18.160 --> 05:23.280
that non-white people don't deserve to live in high class areas.

05:23.280 --> 05:31.760
I don't know how you get off writing this article and not instantly be considered a fucking racist.

05:31.760 --> 05:36.400
They call it RINO, short for River North, but those of us who grew up in Denver, Colorado,

05:36.400 --> 05:42.560
it's still Five Points. Coined the Harlem of the West, Five Points was once an area of jazz joints,

05:42.560 --> 05:46.640
black culture, and cuisine. A place that white folks would once desperately avoid,

05:46.640 --> 05:51.600
or at best pass through on their way to somewhere else. But in the past five years, aggressive

05:51.600 --> 05:57.040
big money gentrification has changed that. Today, the neighborhood brims with local microbreweries,

05:57.040 --> 06:01.440
high-priced bars, and a bevy of brunch joints, where people wait upward to an hour and a half

06:01.440 --> 06:08.320
for a cramped table of two. I gotta say, why can't black people enjoy microbreweries, high-priced

06:08.320 --> 06:16.560
bars, or brunch joints? Is there something... is it allowed? Like, what are you saying here,

06:17.120 --> 06:22.800
Simon Moya Smith? Black people can't go to those things? Are black people cordoned off to

06:22.800 --> 06:27.200
jazz joints, black culture, and black cuisine? Is that all they're allowed to do in your eyes?

06:27.200 --> 06:32.240
Families and local businesses in cities across the U.S. are being hurled from their beloved blocks

06:32.240 --> 06:37.680
and neighborhoods as a result of gentrification, as a result of these new posh places. Oh,

06:38.400 --> 06:42.320
maybe you're complaining that white people are moving into your neighborhood,

06:43.200 --> 06:48.880
and, you know, it sucks because you grew up in that house, and all your neighbors were the same

06:48.880 --> 06:53.040
race as you, and you all had the same basic subculture, and now when you go back, there's

06:53.040 --> 06:57.520
a white family living in your house, and there's white people all over the neighborhood, and things

06:57.520 --> 07:02.000
have changed. Okay, you know, I kind of get it. It's not really you're right anymore because you

07:02.000 --> 07:05.920
don't live there anymore, but I get it. Now, what I've just described is something that white people

07:05.920 --> 07:11.440
have had to deal with for at least 50 years, because immigration usually moves into low-class

07:11.440 --> 07:15.440
white neighborhoods, and they usually slowly take them over. You know, you go to the U.K.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.120
where neighborhoods have become predominantly Muslim immigrant, and they've implemented

07:19.120 --> 07:24.400
like no-go sharia zones and nonsense like that, and look at how ridiculous this is. I've heard

07:24.400 --> 07:28.800
for so long that white flight is racist, that as black people move into a community, white people

07:28.800 --> 07:34.240
move out. That's racist. Here is white people moving into a black community. They're staying

07:34.240 --> 07:40.560
with black people, and that's racist. So it all seems to be racist, all right? If you stay there,

07:40.560 --> 07:45.360
and you resist the incoming waves of people that aren't like you, and you just stay in your

07:45.360 --> 07:50.480
location, that's racist for not moving on, but it's also racist for moving on because it's white

07:50.480 --> 07:55.760
flight, and if you move into a black neighborhood, it's gentrification. It's intruding upon their

07:55.760 --> 08:00.080
space, but if you don't move into a black neighborhood, you think you're too good for them.

08:00.880 --> 08:06.880
Everything is racist, it turns out, which is why if everything is racist, then nothing is,

08:07.520 --> 08:11.600
and I certainly believe that some things are racist, so everything can't be racist,

08:11.600 --> 08:16.480
and so these people just by default are ridiculous. That is the starting point for

08:16.480 --> 08:21.680
this conversation. I saw this when I lived in Brooklyn in 2015, just up the block from my

08:21.680 --> 08:26.560
cramped roach-packed apartment in a neighborhood long known as Sunset Park. The local grocer,

08:26.560 --> 08:31.760
a neighborhood staple, has announced it was shuttering after 36 years. In the 70s and 80s,

08:31.760 --> 08:35.440
the former owners would pay the mafia $500 a week to stay in operation,

08:35.440 --> 08:39.920
but by 2015, the needs and desires of the hipster kind became too much.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.320
The hipsters are more demanding than the mafia, my then girlfriend said at the time.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.880
There's a difference here. There's an obvious difference. In fact, there's a few obvious

08:46.880 --> 08:52.480
differences. One, why would you want to continue living in a cramped roach-packed apartment?

08:53.280 --> 08:59.120
Why wouldn't you like that place to be fixed up a little bit? Two, the hipsters don't demand more

08:59.120 --> 09:04.400
than the mafia. The mafia demanded $500 a week just to exist. The hipsters just didn't shop at

09:04.400 --> 09:12.160
an old-style grocer. That's it. I also made a point in a previous video that a lot of these SJWs

09:12.160 --> 09:18.320
equated white culture with success and black culture with stagnation. I remember saying that,

09:18.320 --> 09:22.800
and I still kind of believe that. That's why you get black people who are successful. They're

09:22.800 --> 09:30.320
called not black enough, or they're told that they act like whitey. Maybe this is it. Maybe

09:30.320 --> 09:35.440
the fact that this person does not want their cramped roach-packed apartment to be fixed up

09:35.440 --> 09:42.800
or replaced with a better apartment or something else is part of this. I understand not having much

09:42.800 --> 09:48.560
but being proud of what you have, but you can't let that get in the way of improving your situation,

09:48.560 --> 09:53.040
can you? I mean, if you do, you end up like America's black community, where for a long

09:53.040 --> 09:58.320
time now they've stagnated and they've refused to improve because it's their culture, it's their

09:58.320 --> 10:03.120
way of life, it's their thing, and acting in an objectively better way to them is acting white.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.120
It's nonsense, and this article's nonsense. Check out this ending, though.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.760
There is no immediate solution to the scourge of gentrification, mainly because we lived in a

10:13.840 --> 10:20.560
rigged cor-corpocracy and an evil oligarchy. But maybe, just maybe, I said this in a previous

10:20.560 --> 10:25.040
episode. If someone ever writes that phrase, instantly discount their opinion because they

10:25.040 --> 10:32.400
don't fucking get it. And yeah, it turns out I was right. Diva was right all along. Enjoy your brunch.

10:32.400 --> 10:38.160
I will. I will enjoy my brunch. Thank you. Thank you, Simon Moya Smith. Fuck you. So I saw this

10:38.160 --> 10:44.400
picture floating around, and in it there's five new stories, but all quite old, in fact. They're

10:44.400 --> 10:52.000
from between 2012 and 2017, but this picture is relatively new. And it kind of made me laugh. It's

10:52.000 --> 11:00.640
as the story gets stupider, the Wojak also gets stupider. I love the retarded Wojaks.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.320
There's the one with the guy whose head is a bicycle, or like a hamster wheel.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.240
But I decided to look up these five stories and actually see what they were all about.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.040
This is on aboutislam.net. Do you know that the U.S. liberty statue represented a Muslim woman?

11:15.600 --> 11:20.000
Really? Early models of the statue were called Egypt carrying the light to Asia.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.640
It was meant to be a female Egyptian peasant as a colossus of Rhodes for the industrial age.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.200
You know, fair enough. You can kind of see the resemblance to the colossus of Rhodes, right?

11:29.200 --> 11:32.640
However, the U.S. liberty statue does not represent a Muslim woman.

11:33.520 --> 11:38.880
It was originally supposed to be a Muslim woman, but it is not one now. And I think that people

11:38.880 --> 11:44.560
started pushing this story because it became politically relevant to do so. Maybe there's

11:44.560 --> 11:49.200
a point to be made that the Statue of Liberty was originally planned to be a Muslim woman,

11:49.200 --> 11:55.440
Egypt carrying the light to Asia. However, there is also a point to be made that it ended up not

11:55.440 --> 12:00.960
being a Muslim woman. But let's check out the second article on this list here. Why kids love

12:01.280 --> 12:08.640
fascist cartoons like Paw Patrol and Thomas? What what makes them fash? This has to be

12:08.640 --> 12:14.000
this has to be a joke. It's not April 1st, but it has to be a joke. People like to see themselves

12:14.000 --> 12:17.760
as purveyors of possibility. We want our children to inhabit a world in which identities are both

12:17.760 --> 12:23.200
mutable and equal and imagination and empathy reign supreme. But children, as dictated by

12:23.200 --> 12:27.360
their tastes in popular culture, have something else in mind. They're drawn to worlds in which

12:27.360 --> 12:32.160
identities are fixed. Order trumps imagination and transgressions are met with routine punishment.

12:32.160 --> 12:38.880
What? Is this is quite literally an old person complaining about what the kids today like?

12:38.880 --> 12:42.880
This clash between what parents desire for their children and what children desire for themselves

12:42.880 --> 12:48.000
is most easily observable in cartoon preferences. So often, the more parents like a show,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.400
the more the children love it. Two of the most divisive shows are Thomas the Tank Engine and

12:52.400 --> 12:57.200
Paw Patrol, both of which have been eviscerated by grownups and discussion boards.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.480
Don't your kids understand the evisceration that grownups have given these shows on internet

13:02.480 --> 13:06.720
discussion boards? Thomas, the long-running television franchise about a group of working

13:06.720 --> 13:11.840
trains chugging away in the island of Sodor, has been called a pre-modern corporate totalitarian

13:11.840 --> 13:17.600
dystopia in The New Yorker, imperialist and sinister and slate, and classist, sexist and

13:17.600 --> 13:23.600
anti-environmentalist in The Guardian. And yet people, presumably parents, spend one billion

13:23.600 --> 13:28.400
dollars on Thomas merchandise every year. Parents, how could you? How could you do this

13:28.400 --> 13:33.520
to your kids? How could you do this to yourselves? But most importantly, how could you do this to

13:33.520 --> 13:38.880
your journalist ruling betters? The New Yorker, Slate, and The Guardian have all told you what

13:38.880 --> 13:44.000
you should be doing and thinking, and you have refused. You have refused to listen to them to

13:44.000 --> 13:50.240
the tune of one billion dollars a year. How could you? Even Buzzfeed called the show terrible and

13:50.320 --> 13:55.520
pointed to instances of gender and social inequality. How could you not understand?

13:55.520 --> 14:00.800
Rage as we might, these shows are a source of comfort for our young children, whose id-driven

14:00.800 --> 14:06.400
brains seek out the order, stability, and even punishment in their entertainment. You know,

14:08.480 --> 14:15.680
order, stability, and sometimes even punishment are not negative things. I know for some reason

14:16.160 --> 14:21.680
you hate the concept of order, but it is very important and not all order is fascist,

14:21.680 --> 14:26.400
even though you slapped fascism into the title of this article. You haven't even brought fascism up

14:26.400 --> 14:32.320
yet. Where is it? Where's the fascism? Hold on. So as it turns out, there's only three uses of

14:32.320 --> 14:40.960
the word fascist in this article. One is in the top bar where the title is repeated. One is in

14:40.960 --> 14:49.040
the title itself. And the third one is here. This woman has no qualms letting her four-year-old

14:49.040 --> 14:53.680
watch Thomas, which is his favorite thing in the entire world. I think it's evolved a lot over the

14:53.680 --> 15:00.800
years, which is why I don't really agree with the fascist label. But that seems to be it. That's the

15:00.800 --> 15:12.720
only... is there anything like fascism? No. Is Nazi in here? No. Totalitarians in here once.

15:14.800 --> 15:19.760
So the only thing that makes these cartoons fascist is that your peers have called them

15:19.760 --> 15:25.600
fascist. This has to be the most worthless article I have ever presented on this show.

15:25.600 --> 15:31.360
Let's check out the middle one though. Women's March expected to be the largest gathering of

15:31.360 --> 15:42.480
people with disabilities in US history. Oh boy. Dude, she skipped leg day. Okay, that was a really

15:42.480 --> 15:48.320
bad joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What happens when a man who now has the keys to the

15:48.320 --> 15:52.880
highest office openly mock people with disabilities? They fight back. Didn't the

15:52.880 --> 15:59.920
Women's March fall apart? I've had a back burner video kind of brewing for a while about just the

15:59.920 --> 16:04.240
beginning and end of the Women's March. Maybe I should do it sometime soon. And yeah, this article

16:04.240 --> 16:09.040
seems to be nothing but just talking about how they didn't like that Trump did that whole hand

16:09.040 --> 16:17.280
hitting his chest imitation of a disabled person. Which yeah, that was pretty rude. But it seems

16:17.280 --> 16:21.280
like something a teenage boy would do, because it's something that many teenage boys, including

16:21.280 --> 16:25.760
myself, did when we were teenagers. Or even when we were younger than that, even when we were 12

16:25.760 --> 16:31.520
or something. If we wanted to make fun of one of the disabled kids in the special ed classes in the

16:31.520 --> 16:37.600
school, we would do that. And I'm not saying it's good. I'm not saying it's proper. I wouldn't do it

16:37.600 --> 16:42.720
in polite company. I probably wouldn't do it as an adult anymore. I was a dumb kid. And the fact that

16:42.720 --> 16:48.240
Trump did it as an adult kind of makes him look stupid. But that's really it, isn't it? It doesn't

16:48.240 --> 16:52.480
delegitimize him as president. It doesn't mean that his other speeches are all inherently bad.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.400
It doesn't mean that his policies or the work that he's done is all bad. It just makes him

16:56.400 --> 17:01.360
an insensitive asshole. And I don't think people elected him for him to be nice. We're going down

17:01.360 --> 17:07.040
the list here. Americans who practice yoga contribute to white supremacy. You know, I've

17:07.040 --> 17:12.480
seen this claim made before. I think I talked about it in one of the How Cucked Us Canada videos,

17:12.480 --> 17:18.720
where there was a yoga class in Ottawa that was... People tried to shut it down because it was

17:18.720 --> 17:25.600
run by white people. And they said it was cultural appropriation. And then they went to a temple

17:25.600 --> 17:29.440
in Ottawa. And they said, hey, do you think that white people practicing yoga is cultural

17:29.440 --> 17:34.160
appropriation? And they said, no, it's fine. It's happy that you guys are spreading and enjoying

17:34.160 --> 17:39.520
our culture. Just like we're here in Canada and we're enjoying yours. Cultural appropriation has

17:39.520 --> 17:44.480
always been dumb because cultures have always mingled. It's stupid. White people who do a

17:44.480 --> 17:48.320
downward facing dog are contributing to a system of power, privilege, and oppression.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.320
Yeah, I'm sure they are. Sharina Gandhi. Are you related to the actual Gandhi?

17:54.320 --> 17:58.480
A religious studies professor at Michigan State claims in an article she recently co-authored

17:58.480 --> 18:02.320
that Americans who practice yoga are contributing to white supremacy and promote the yoga

18:02.320 --> 18:10.720
industrial complex. Yoga industrial complex? Are you fucking kidding me?

18:11.440 --> 18:15.120
Okay, what's this article that she wrote? Hold on a minute. The Praxis Centre,

18:15.120 --> 18:22.080
Arcus Centre for Social Justice Leadership. Yoga and the roots of cultural appropriation.

18:22.720 --> 18:29.840
Hold on. Sharina Gandhi and Lily Wolf? These can't be their real names. They must have changed

18:29.840 --> 18:35.920
their names to imitate influential figures. There's no way. Yoga's popularity was a direct

18:35.920 --> 18:40.160
consequence of a larger system of cultural appropriation that capitalism engenders and

18:40.160 --> 18:44.880
reifies. While the misappropriation of yoga may not be a life threatening racist,

18:45.840 --> 18:49.600
it is part of systemic racism nonetheless. And it is important to ask what are the

18:49.600 --> 18:54.240
impetuses for this cultural grabbing? Maybe it's because yoga is healthy and there are

18:54.320 --> 19:00.400
people who want to be healthy and so they are willing in fact to go cross culture to gleam

19:00.400 --> 19:05.360
bits of useful information and practices from multiple different cultures to create a healthy

19:05.360 --> 19:12.400
lifestyle because no culture is perfect, obviously. Oh god. How to decolonize your yoga practice.

19:12.400 --> 19:17.040
Okay, show me open democracy. How do I fucking decolonize my yoga practice?

19:18.080 --> 19:22.400
I've gone down like a link hole it seems. This is basically just me link surfing on the show now.

19:22.400 --> 19:28.560
Oh, 404 page number. We can't do it, can we? I guess we just can't decolonize yoga. Fuck you.

19:28.560 --> 19:34.240
Racism, ahimsa, and yoga in the face of inequality. What would you know about a white girl?

19:34.240 --> 19:40.480
Like, hold on. You're a white girl, aren't you? Oh, you might be mixed. You might be half white,

19:40.480 --> 19:45.040
half Asian. I have to know. I have to know if you're a racist. I have to know.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.400
Walnut Creek, California. Why am I not fucking surprised?

19:48.800 --> 19:53.440
Oh, and it turns out that her progressivism has rewarded her with a Netflix show.

19:54.240 --> 19:58.800
All about yoga. I wonder if you're part of the problem here. The final one appears to be

19:58.800 --> 20:06.880
a picture of a TV with the headline PB&J sandwiches. Are they racist?

20:07.840 --> 20:13.840
I couldn't find this specific clip, but I do have this. Peanut butter and jelly racist?

20:14.640 --> 20:20.400
Portland School Principal. Of course it's fucking Portland. Ties sandwich to white privilege. This

20:20.400 --> 20:25.520
is back from 2012, so it's pretty old, but still, it's fucking stupid, isn't it? And of course it

20:25.520 --> 20:30.000
would be Portland. Portland 2012 is like the rest of the world 2019, it seems.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.480
The sandwich has broader implications about race. No, it doesn't. It's a fucking sandwich.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.280
The sandwich was reportedly mentioned in a lesson plan last year.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.480
A teacher used it as an example of a subtle form of racism in language.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.720
What about Somali or Hispanic students who might not eat sandwiches?

20:44.720 --> 20:49.040
Another way would be to say Americans eat peanut butter and jelly. Do you have anything like that?

20:49.040 --> 20:54.960
Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta or pita. Who cares? This isn't a fucking buffet.

20:54.960 --> 21:01.360
It's a cafeteria. Eat your sandwich. Bring your own lunch. Go somewhere else. Like,

21:01.360 --> 21:05.120
imagine the fucking entitlement you have to have, the chip on your shoulder, to walk into

21:05.120 --> 21:10.960
a cafeteria. Look at the selections and say, no, I want something else. You're going to make

21:10.960 --> 21:17.280
me something else. And it's racist that you don't, and it's racist that you don't already

21:17.280 --> 21:22.800
have alternatives to begin with. Fuck you. One refreshing thing about this article is

21:22.800 --> 21:26.400
that because it was written in 2012, the part of the article that talks about regular people

21:26.400 --> 21:32.080
on Twitter mocking the whole story is simply presented straight. It's not twisted in such a

21:32.080 --> 21:37.520
way that your average Joe on Twitter is painted as a racist for not taking this deathly seriously

21:37.520 --> 21:42.960
like it is in 2019. What's the verdict on grilled cheese? Racist? Sexist? All sandwiches are racist.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.040
It's the name sandwich the poor tortas are discriminated against. Yeah, see, this sounds

21:47.040 --> 21:53.840
like just shit posters, right? And in 2019, you would get a warning for this stuff. But in 2012,

21:53.840 --> 22:04.160
it's all good fun. Let's go back, guys, please. Let's just go back. 2012 YouTube, 2012 Twitch.

22:04.880 --> 22:09.760
It was just a better internet all around. That does it for me, guys. I know that it wasn't

22:09.760 --> 22:14.640
necessarily up-to-date articles, but I think it was fun to have a little dive into the past there.

22:14.640 --> 22:20.400
Thank you very much, JT Viper, for the coffee. It is quite delicious. Speaking of 2012 Twitch,

22:20.400 --> 22:25.840
when I stream on my Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, I basically treat it like

22:25.840 --> 22:30.560
it's 2012. Whenever I do gaming content on the internet, I treat it like it's between

22:30.560 --> 22:37.600
2009 and 2012. The modern golden age of video games. It wasn't quite as good as the actual

22:37.600 --> 22:43.120
golden age like the Super Nintendo and 64 era, but it was still pretty good. The Wii PS3 360

22:43.120 --> 22:48.000
generation was was quite a lot of fun in my opinion. I bring all that up because I am in fact

22:48.000 --> 22:55.760
streaming tonight. It'll be me and three other friends piling onto a coach and playing Tales of

22:55.760 --> 23:03.680
Vesperia, which surprise, surprise, I think is a 2011 era 360 JRPG that has been re-released

23:03.680 --> 23:08.320
on the PS4 and like a high definition quality. And we've been making our way through the story

23:08.320 --> 23:13.200
mode of that game as a four player group. So we'll be doing that tonight. Drop by, say hi,

23:13.200 --> 23:18.240
I'd love to see you there. I'm actually still working on the 50,000 sub video. I know it's

23:18.240 --> 23:22.880
been like a month, but I've kind of had, I've had something planned that I needed to wait for some

23:22.880 --> 23:28.400
props to come in for. And so I will be able to get that out to you maybe in the next two weeks

23:28.400 --> 23:35.040
or so. Of course, I'll try to keep on the daily videos as well. As for D and D Sargon says it's

23:35.040 --> 23:40.800
up this this week on Wednesday. So let's hope guys. Anyway, I'm getting out of here. Hope to

23:40.800 --> 23:43.040
see you guys at the stream tonight. I love you.
