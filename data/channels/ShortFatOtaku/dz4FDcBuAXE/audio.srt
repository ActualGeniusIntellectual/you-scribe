00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey guys, Dev here. Welcome to this week's The Weekly Sip. Today I'm going to be having

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:16,720
this. It is Kicking Horse Coffee. 454 horsepower, dark, velvety, earthy, spirited ground coffee.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,040
This was mailed to me by a viewer, JT Viper. He watches the videos. He's in the Twitch stream

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,280
sometimes. Thank you very much, dude. I really appreciate it. He said he wanted me to try it out

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,120
on The Weekly Sips. I'm going to try it out. This smooth, riding, dark horse conjures up power from

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,880
the depths of the shadows. This is the winner, the champion of taste. The one that goes the

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,000
extra mile. Hop on, hold on, and head for the hills. Let's give it a try. You know,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,560
I've never quite had a coffee like this. Usually, like, for example, my coffee is stored in the

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,640
Zelda thing. The sugar's in the Game Boy. Naomi's tea is in the Overwatch loot box.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,560
But I've never really had any kind of specialty coffee before, so I'm kind of excited.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,040
Keurig's heating up. Oh, that's quite the strong smell to the grounds. Jesus.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,160
Oh, yeah. All right, I'm back in the office. And listening back to that video, I didn't think you

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,440
guys could hear the rain out there. It's a pretty rainy day today. Hope you guys don't mind. But

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,320
let's try out JT Viper's, hopefully delicious, donated coffee.

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
Oh, based on the smell, I thought it would be more acidic, but it's not.

16
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,680
It's definitely very strong, though. Holy shit. Oh, and it leaves like a

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,880
like a lingering coffee aftertaste in my mouth, the way that most coffees don't actually do.

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,800
It's good, though. Thank you very much, JT Viper.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,040
Any of you guys who do want to send me stuff to have me try it out on the show,

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,040
I have put my address out there. It's no big deal. I don't really care.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,400
So in one of my videos this week, I mentioned Super Gonorrhea.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,240
And I got a couple questions. What the hell is Super Gonorrhea? Well,

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,280
this is what Super Gonorrhea is. Super Gonorrhea spread causes deep concern on the BBC News.

24
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
Two women in the UK have been infected with Super Gonorrhea, sparking deep concern from

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
sexual health doctors. A European party destination is one line of inquiry,

26
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
and health officials are trying to contact subsequent sexual partners in the UK.

27
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,440
Both women have since been cured of their infections, which are resistant to the main

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,840
therapy. That's why it's Super Gonorrhea. It's resistant to usual Gonorrhea therapy?

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
I swear to god, thoughts are gonna fucking kill us all.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,600
Both women were infected with a version of Gonorrhea that was resistant to the

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,920
first choice antibiotics. The cases were not related to the world's worst case,

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,840
which was detected in the UK in 2018 after a trip to Southeast Asia.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,720
Oh, I wonder what the world's worst case was. World's Worst Super Gonorrhea Man Cured.

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,320
He picked up the superbug having sex with a woman in Southeast Asia,

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,960
despite having a British partner. Well, this is one way to find out that your man's cheating on

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,480
you. He gets Super Gonorrhea and makes the news. But yeah, the bacterium Nasiria gonorrhea has

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,760
rapidly developed resistance to new antibiotics. I made the argument in my Where Have the Good Men

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,320
Gone video that the complete loosening of sexual morality led to basically a lot of suffering

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,880
through the extreme propagation of STDs. And now there's definitely a component of the modern

40
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,920
sexual lifestyle that values safe sex. But even that's being dismantled by the SJWs because they

41
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,360
made it legal in California for people to hide their HIV status, claiming that it discriminated

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,920
against gay men. Basically, the adaptation of STDs to all of our various drugs is going to continue.

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,800
So either we find new cures or we change some of our behavior. There's really no way around this.

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,960
Here's something really stupid for you guys. Your fancy new brunch place is probably colonialist,

45
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,240
and you're a colonizer. Gentrification is just the latest iteration of colonization,

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,600
but now it comes with eggs benedict and bottomless mimosas.

47
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,800
Okay, so let me get this straight. You have a ghetto in a city and you gentrify it,

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,640
you kind of spruce it up. You build parks, you have like higher class properties.

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:39,440
That's colonization. In linking colonization and gentrification, you're making the argument

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,320
that white people just naturally live in gentrified areas and that black people or

51
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
whatever race, whatever non-white race you're talking about. I assume it's black people,

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,000
it's an American article, but black people live naturally in non-gentrified places.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,320
There's no debate here that a gentrified area, property values go up, the houses are nicer,

54
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,040
the shops are nicer, the streets are cleaner. It is making a place better. And you can argue that,

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,200
oh, well now poor people can't afford to live there. Fair enough. That's also a problem that

56
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,160
needs tackling. But if you're linking gentrification with colonizing, then you're explicitly saying

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,280
that non-white people don't deserve to live in high class areas.

58
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:31,760
I don't know how you get off writing this article and not instantly be considered a fucking racist.

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,400
They call it RINO, short for River North, but those of us who grew up in Denver, Colorado,

60
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,560
it's still Five Points. Coined the Harlem of the West, Five Points was once an area of jazz joints,

61
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,640
black culture, and cuisine. A place that white folks would once desperately avoid,

62
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,600
or at best pass through on their way to somewhere else. But in the past five years, aggressive

63
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,040
big money gentrification has changed that. Today, the neighborhood brims with local microbreweries,

64
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,440
high-priced bars, and a bevy of brunch joints, where people wait upward to an hour and a half

65
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,320
for a cramped table of two. I gotta say, why can't black people enjoy microbreweries, high-priced

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,560
bars, or brunch joints? Is there something... is it allowed? Like, what are you saying here,

67
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,800
Simon Moya Smith? Black people can't go to those things? Are black people cordoned off to

68
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,200
jazz joints, black culture, and black cuisine? Is that all they're allowed to do in your eyes?

69
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,240
Families and local businesses in cities across the U.S. are being hurled from their beloved blocks

70
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,680
and neighborhoods as a result of gentrification, as a result of these new posh places. Oh,

71
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,320
maybe you're complaining that white people are moving into your neighborhood,

72
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,880
and, you know, it sucks because you grew up in that house, and all your neighbors were the same

73
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,040
race as you, and you all had the same basic subculture, and now when you go back, there's

74
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,520
a white family living in your house, and there's white people all over the neighborhood, and things

75
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,000
have changed. Okay, you know, I kind of get it. It's not really you're right anymore because you

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,920
don't live there anymore, but I get it. Now, what I've just described is something that white people

77
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,440
have had to deal with for at least 50 years, because immigration usually moves into low-class

78
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
white neighborhoods, and they usually slowly take them over. You know, you go to the U.K.

79
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,120
where neighborhoods have become predominantly Muslim immigrant, and they've implemented

80
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,400
like no-go sharia zones and nonsense like that, and look at how ridiculous this is. I've heard

81
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,800
for so long that white flight is racist, that as black people move into a community, white people

82
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,240
move out. That's racist. Here is white people moving into a black community. They're staying

83
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,560
with black people, and that's racist. So it all seems to be racist, all right? If you stay there,

84
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
and you resist the incoming waves of people that aren't like you, and you just stay in your

85
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,480
location, that's racist for not moving on, but it's also racist for moving on because it's white

86
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,760
flight, and if you move into a black neighborhood, it's gentrification. It's intruding upon their

87
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,080
space, but if you don't move into a black neighborhood, you think you're too good for them.

88
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Everything is racist, it turns out, which is why if everything is racist, then nothing is,

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,600
and I certainly believe that some things are racist, so everything can't be racist,

90
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,480
and so these people just by default are ridiculous. That is the starting point for

91
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,680
this conversation. I saw this when I lived in Brooklyn in 2015, just up the block from my

92
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,560
cramped roach-packed apartment in a neighborhood long known as Sunset Park. The local grocer,

93
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,760
a neighborhood staple, has announced it was shuttering after 36 years. In the 70s and 80s,

94
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,440
the former owners would pay the mafia $500 a week to stay in operation,

95
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,920
but by 2015, the needs and desires of the hipster kind became too much.

96
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,320
The hipsters are more demanding than the mafia, my then girlfriend said at the time.

97
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,880
There's a difference here. There's an obvious difference. In fact, there's a few obvious

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,480
differences. One, why would you want to continue living in a cramped roach-packed apartment?

99
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,120
Why wouldn't you like that place to be fixed up a little bit? Two, the hipsters don't demand more

100
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,400
than the mafia. The mafia demanded $500 a week just to exist. The hipsters just didn't shop at

101
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:12,160
an old-style grocer. That's it. I also made a point in a previous video that a lot of these SJWs

102
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,320
equated white culture with success and black culture with stagnation. I remember saying that,

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,800
and I still kind of believe that. That's why you get black people who are successful. They're

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,320
called not black enough, or they're told that they act like whitey. Maybe this is it. Maybe

105
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,440
the fact that this person does not want their cramped roach-packed apartment to be fixed up

106
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,800
or replaced with a better apartment or something else is part of this. I understand not having much

107
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,560
but being proud of what you have, but you can't let that get in the way of improving your situation,

108
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,040
can you? I mean, if you do, you end up like America's black community, where for a long

109
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,320
time now they've stagnated and they've refused to improve because it's their culture, it's their

110
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,120
way of life, it's their thing, and acting in an objectively better way to them is acting white.

111
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,120
It's nonsense, and this article's nonsense. Check out this ending, though.

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,760
There is no immediate solution to the scourge of gentrification, mainly because we lived in a

113
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,560
rigged cor-corpocracy and an evil oligarchy. But maybe, just maybe, I said this in a previous

114
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,040
episode. If someone ever writes that phrase, instantly discount their opinion because they

115
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,400
don't fucking get it. And yeah, it turns out I was right. Diva was right all along. Enjoy your brunch.

116
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,160
I will. I will enjoy my brunch. Thank you. Thank you, Simon Moya Smith. Fuck you. So I saw this

117
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,400
picture floating around, and in it there's five new stories, but all quite old, in fact. They're

118
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:52,000
from between 2012 and 2017, but this picture is relatively new. And it kind of made me laugh. It's

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,640
as the story gets stupider, the Wojak also gets stupider. I love the retarded Wojaks.

120
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,320
There's the one with the guy whose head is a bicycle, or like a hamster wheel.

121
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,240
But I decided to look up these five stories and actually see what they were all about.

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,040
This is on aboutislam.net. Do you know that the U.S. liberty statue represented a Muslim woman?

123
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
Really? Early models of the statue were called Egypt carrying the light to Asia.

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,640
It was meant to be a female Egyptian peasant as a colossus of Rhodes for the industrial age.

125
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
You know, fair enough. You can kind of see the resemblance to the colossus of Rhodes, right?

126
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,640
However, the U.S. liberty statue does not represent a Muslim woman.

127
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,880
It was originally supposed to be a Muslim woman, but it is not one now. And I think that people

128
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,560
started pushing this story because it became politically relevant to do so. Maybe there's

129
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,200
a point to be made that the Statue of Liberty was originally planned to be a Muslim woman,

130
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,440
Egypt carrying the light to Asia. However, there is also a point to be made that it ended up not

131
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,960
being a Muslim woman. But let's check out the second article on this list here. Why kids love

132
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,640
fascist cartoons like Paw Patrol and Thomas? What what makes them fash? This has to be

133
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,000
this has to be a joke. It's not April 1st, but it has to be a joke. People like to see themselves

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
as purveyors of possibility. We want our children to inhabit a world in which identities are both

135
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,200
mutable and equal and imagination and empathy reign supreme. But children, as dictated by

136
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,360
their tastes in popular culture, have something else in mind. They're drawn to worlds in which

137
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,160
identities are fixed. Order trumps imagination and transgressions are met with routine punishment.

138
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,880
What? Is this is quite literally an old person complaining about what the kids today like?

139
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
This clash between what parents desire for their children and what children desire for themselves

140
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,000
is most easily observable in cartoon preferences. So often, the more parents like a show,

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,400
the more the children love it. Two of the most divisive shows are Thomas the Tank Engine and

142
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Paw Patrol, both of which have been eviscerated by grownups and discussion boards.

143
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,480
Don't your kids understand the evisceration that grownups have given these shows on internet

144
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,720
discussion boards? Thomas, the long-running television franchise about a group of working

145
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,840
trains chugging away in the island of Sodor, has been called a pre-modern corporate totalitarian

146
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,600
dystopia in The New Yorker, imperialist and sinister and slate, and classist, sexist and

147
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,600
anti-environmentalist in The Guardian. And yet people, presumably parents, spend one billion

148
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,400
dollars on Thomas merchandise every year. Parents, how could you? How could you do this

149
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,520
to your kids? How could you do this to yourselves? But most importantly, how could you do this to

150
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,880
your journalist ruling betters? The New Yorker, Slate, and The Guardian have all told you what

151
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,000
you should be doing and thinking, and you have refused. You have refused to listen to them to

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,240
the tune of one billion dollars a year. How could you? Even Buzzfeed called the show terrible and

153
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,520
pointed to instances of gender and social inequality. How could you not understand?

154
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,800
Rage as we might, these shows are a source of comfort for our young children, whose id-driven

155
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,400
brains seek out the order, stability, and even punishment in their entertainment. You know,

156
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,680
order, stability, and sometimes even punishment are not negative things. I know for some reason

157
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,680
you hate the concept of order, but it is very important and not all order is fascist,

158
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,400
even though you slapped fascism into the title of this article. You haven't even brought fascism up

159
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,320
yet. Where is it? Where's the fascism? Hold on. So as it turns out, there's only three uses of

160
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:40,960
the word fascist in this article. One is in the top bar where the title is repeated. One is in

161
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:49,040
the title itself. And the third one is here. This woman has no qualms letting her four-year-old

162
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,680
watch Thomas, which is his favorite thing in the entire world. I think it's evolved a lot over the

163
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,800
years, which is why I don't really agree with the fascist label. But that seems to be it. That's the

164
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:12,720
only... is there anything like fascism? No. Is Nazi in here? No. Totalitarians in here once.

165
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,760
So the only thing that makes these cartoons fascist is that your peers have called them

166
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,600
fascist. This has to be the most worthless article I have ever presented on this show.

167
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,360
Let's check out the middle one though. Women's March expected to be the largest gathering of

168
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:42,480
people with disabilities in US history. Oh boy. Dude, she skipped leg day. Okay, that was a really

169
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,320
bad joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What happens when a man who now has the keys to the

170
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,880
highest office openly mock people with disabilities? They fight back. Didn't the

171
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,920
Women's March fall apart? I've had a back burner video kind of brewing for a while about just the

172
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,240
beginning and end of the Women's March. Maybe I should do it sometime soon. And yeah, this article

173
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,040
seems to be nothing but just talking about how they didn't like that Trump did that whole hand

174
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:17,280
hitting his chest imitation of a disabled person. Which yeah, that was pretty rude. But it seems

175
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,280
like something a teenage boy would do, because it's something that many teenage boys, including

176
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,760
myself, did when we were teenagers. Or even when we were younger than that, even when we were 12

177
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,520
or something. If we wanted to make fun of one of the disabled kids in the special ed classes in the

178
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,600
school, we would do that. And I'm not saying it's good. I'm not saying it's proper. I wouldn't do it

179
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,720
in polite company. I probably wouldn't do it as an adult anymore. I was a dumb kid. And the fact that

180
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,240
Trump did it as an adult kind of makes him look stupid. But that's really it, isn't it? It doesn't

181
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,480
delegitimize him as president. It doesn't mean that his other speeches are all inherently bad.

182
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,400
It doesn't mean that his policies or the work that he's done is all bad. It just makes him

183
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,360
an insensitive asshole. And I don't think people elected him for him to be nice. We're going down

184
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,040
the list here. Americans who practice yoga contribute to white supremacy. You know, I've

185
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,480
seen this claim made before. I think I talked about it in one of the How Cucked Us Canada videos,

186
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,720
where there was a yoga class in Ottawa that was... People tried to shut it down because it was

187
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,600
run by white people. And they said it was cultural appropriation. And then they went to a temple

188
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,440
in Ottawa. And they said, hey, do you think that white people practicing yoga is cultural

189
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,160
appropriation? And they said, no, it's fine. It's happy that you guys are spreading and enjoying

190
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,520
our culture. Just like we're here in Canada and we're enjoying yours. Cultural appropriation has

191
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,480
always been dumb because cultures have always mingled. It's stupid. White people who do a

192
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,320
downward facing dog are contributing to a system of power, privilege, and oppression.

193
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah, I'm sure they are. Sharina Gandhi. Are you related to the actual Gandhi?

194
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,480
A religious studies professor at Michigan State claims in an article she recently co-authored

195
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
that Americans who practice yoga are contributing to white supremacy and promote the yoga

196
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:10,720
industrial complex. Yoga industrial complex? Are you fucking kidding me?

197
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
Okay, what's this article that she wrote? Hold on a minute. The Praxis Centre,

198
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,080
Arcus Centre for Social Justice Leadership. Yoga and the roots of cultural appropriation.

199
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,840
Hold on. Sharina Gandhi and Lily Wolf? These can't be their real names. They must have changed

200
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,920
their names to imitate influential figures. There's no way. Yoga's popularity was a direct

201
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,160
consequence of a larger system of cultural appropriation that capitalism engenders and

202
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,880
reifies. While the misappropriation of yoga may not be a life threatening racist,

203
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,600
it is part of systemic racism nonetheless. And it is important to ask what are the

204
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,240
impetuses for this cultural grabbing? Maybe it's because yoga is healthy and there are

205
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,400
people who want to be healthy and so they are willing in fact to go cross culture to gleam

206
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,360
bits of useful information and practices from multiple different cultures to create a healthy

207
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,400
lifestyle because no culture is perfect, obviously. Oh god. How to decolonize your yoga practice.

208
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,040
Okay, show me open democracy. How do I fucking decolonize my yoga practice?

209
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,400
I've gone down like a link hole it seems. This is basically just me link surfing on the show now.

210
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,560
Oh, 404 page number. We can't do it, can we? I guess we just can't decolonize yoga. Fuck you.

211
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,240
Racism, ahimsa, and yoga in the face of inequality. What would you know about a white girl?

212
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,480
Like, hold on. You're a white girl, aren't you? Oh, you might be mixed. You might be half white,

213
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,040
half Asian. I have to know. I have to know if you're a racist. I have to know.

214
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,400
Walnut Creek, California. Why am I not fucking surprised?

215
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,440
Oh, and it turns out that her progressivism has rewarded her with a Netflix show.

216
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,800
All about yoga. I wonder if you're part of the problem here. The final one appears to be

217
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:06,880
a picture of a TV with the headline PB&J sandwiches. Are they racist?

218
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,840
I couldn't find this specific clip, but I do have this. Peanut butter and jelly racist?

219
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,400
Portland School Principal. Of course it's fucking Portland. Ties sandwich to white privilege. This

220
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,520
is back from 2012, so it's pretty old, but still, it's fucking stupid, isn't it? And of course it

221
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,000
would be Portland. Portland 2012 is like the rest of the world 2019, it seems.

222
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
The sandwich has broader implications about race. No, it doesn't. It's a fucking sandwich.

223
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,280
The sandwich was reportedly mentioned in a lesson plan last year.

224
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
A teacher used it as an example of a subtle form of racism in language.

225
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
What about Somali or Hispanic students who might not eat sandwiches?

226
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,040
Another way would be to say Americans eat peanut butter and jelly. Do you have anything like that?

227
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,960
Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta or pita. Who cares? This isn't a fucking buffet.

228
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,360
It's a cafeteria. Eat your sandwich. Bring your own lunch. Go somewhere else. Like,

229
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,120
imagine the fucking entitlement you have to have, the chip on your shoulder, to walk into

230
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,960
a cafeteria. Look at the selections and say, no, I want something else. You're going to make

231
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,280
me something else. And it's racist that you don't, and it's racist that you don't already

232
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,800
have alternatives to begin with. Fuck you. One refreshing thing about this article is

233
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,400
that because it was written in 2012, the part of the article that talks about regular people

234
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,080
on Twitter mocking the whole story is simply presented straight. It's not twisted in such a

235
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,520
way that your average Joe on Twitter is painted as a racist for not taking this deathly seriously

236
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,960
like it is in 2019. What's the verdict on grilled cheese? Racist? Sexist? All sandwiches are racist.

237
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,040
It's the name sandwich the poor tortas are discriminated against. Yeah, see, this sounds

238
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,840
like just shit posters, right? And in 2019, you would get a warning for this stuff. But in 2012,

239
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:04,160
it's all good fun. Let's go back, guys, please. Let's just go back. 2012 YouTube, 2012 Twitch.

240
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,760
It was just a better internet all around. That does it for me, guys. I know that it wasn't

241
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,640
necessarily up-to-date articles, but I think it was fun to have a little dive into the past there.

242
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,400
Thank you very much, JT Viper, for the coffee. It is quite delicious. Speaking of 2012 Twitch,

243
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,840
when I stream on my Twitch channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers, I basically treat it like

244
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,560
it's 2012. Whenever I do gaming content on the internet, I treat it like it's between

245
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,600
2009 and 2012. The modern golden age of video games. It wasn't quite as good as the actual

246
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,120
golden age like the Super Nintendo and 64 era, but it was still pretty good. The Wii PS3 360

247
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,000
generation was was quite a lot of fun in my opinion. I bring all that up because I am in fact

248
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,760
streaming tonight. It'll be me and three other friends piling onto a coach and playing Tales of

249
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:03,680
Vesperia, which surprise, surprise, I think is a 2011 era 360 JRPG that has been re-released

250
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,320
on the PS4 and like a high definition quality. And we've been making our way through the story

251
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,200
mode of that game as a four player group. So we'll be doing that tonight. Drop by, say hi,

252
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,240
I'd love to see you there. I'm actually still working on the 50,000 sub video. I know it's

253
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
been like a month, but I've kind of had, I've had something planned that I needed to wait for some

254
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,400
props to come in for. And so I will be able to get that out to you maybe in the next two weeks

255
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,040
or so. Of course, I'll try to keep on the daily videos as well. As for D and D Sargon says it's

256
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,800
up this this week on Wednesday. So let's hope guys. Anyway, I'm getting out of here. Hope to

257
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,040
see you guys at the stream tonight. I love you.
