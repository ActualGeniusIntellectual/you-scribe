0	9820	So, I was reading the Buffalo Shooter's Manifesto for last week's TUBcast, and I'm sure I don't
9820	13420	need to tell you this, but a lot of his motivation revolved around The Great Replacement.
13420	17020	In case you don't know, though I think everyone knows this by now, The Great Replacement is
17020	20060	a conspiracy theory by the French writer Renaud Camus.
20060	21060	Camus?
21060	22060	Camus?
22060	24100	I don't know French guys, even though I'm a Canadian, I don't know French.
24100	29280	It states that the predominantly ethnic French population of France is actively being replaced
29280	33860	by a one-two punch of declining indigenous French birth rates and an increase of foreign
33860	38320	immigration to France, specifically of the non-European variety, more specifically of
38320	39600	the Muslim variety.
39600	43800	He believes this is a coordinated effort by a cabal of elites within French society that
43800	45720	he calls The Replacists.
45720	50720	Though he only wrote about this idea in the context of France in his 2011 book The Grand
50720	55000	Replacement, the idea has a lot of similarity with the theories of the American neo-Nazi
55000	60340	David Lane, who coined the phrase white genocide to refer to, yeah, the exact same thing, low
60340	63840	fertility rates and high amounts of non-white immigration to America, leading to a demographic
63840	65340	decline of white people.
65340	69420	Being a neo-Nazi, Lane obviously blamed a cabal of Jews running everything in place
69420	73000	of the French Replacists, but there's a lot of overlap between the two ideas, such that
73000	77740	in the modern era, the phrases great replacement and white genocide have become synonymous
77740	81360	despite them having two different origins, and the Buffalo Shooter used both of their
81360	83400	rhetoric interchangeably in his manifesto.
83800	87000	By the way, if you're watching this on YouTube, ever since the Buffalo Massacre, YouTube's
87000	90920	been adding these COVID-type cards to every video discussing the topic, you can probably
90920	91920	see one right here below.
91920	95360	It's nice to see that shepherding viewers to politically approved sources is alive and
95360	96800	well, even though lockdowns are over.
96800	99800	Yes, YouTube, the great savior, save us all from wrongthink.
99800	101840	I'm just joking around, please don't demonetize me.
101840	105400	In the wake of Buffalo, just like in the wake of Christchurch, the online left began to
105400	109920	blame a number of rightist creators for spreading the great replacement conspiracy theory, and
109920	112280	therefore, radicalizing people into violence.
112280	114520	One of these people so blamed is Lauren Southern.
114520	118040	I got into it a little bit in the Paul Joseph Watson video, the TLDR on Lauren Southern
118040	122440	is that while she was much more libertarian and conspiracy-y in her youth, she left the
122440	126280	alt-right, left the internet, started a family, and came back a year or two later as a very
126280	128200	standard conservative mom type.
128200	132320	Left-leaning people have been very vocal in blaming Destiny for helping rehab Lauren's
132320	136280	image among centrists, since the two of them have palled around a lot on stream since her
136280	139720	return, and she does seem to genuinely be moving away from some of her more radical
139720	140720	older views.
140720	144960	So now the discourse is, Destiny, how could you associate with a person who inspired Christchurch
144960	145960	and Buffalo?
145960	148640	It's possible that Lauren's aware of the influence that she's had, because her own
148640	152120	video on the great replacement from 2017 has been sent to private on her channel.
152120	156200	I know this because Sean did a video replying to it back in the day, and he links hers in
156200	158600	the description, and clicking on it brings up the fact that it's private, so it's
158600	159720	easy to actually confirm.
159720	163120	That being said, it's not hard to find a copy of Lauren's video, and since a big
163120	167800	meta conversation in the Twitch politics space right now is Lauren rehabbing her image, I
167800	170120	decided to watch it to see what the fuss was all about.
170120	173720	The great replacement is a term coined by French writer, Renaud Camus.
173720	176320	Oh yeah, that's how you pronounce the name, thanks Lauren.
176320	177320	You know what?
177320	181680	I actually didn't see this video back in 2017, and based on the number of people screeching
181680	185480	online, I thought this was going to be a video of Lauren Southern sacrificing black babies
185480	186800	to Moloch or something.
186800	187800	But you know what?
187800	191160	She's very inflammatory, using some of the b-roll in the way that she does, and I don't
191160	195860	agree with her conclusions, but the actual raw data in the video seems to be accurate.
195860	199680	The birth rates of native people in first world countries, not just white ones, but
199680	203080	clearly places like Japan and South Korea as well, are down.
203080	206640	Immigration is slowly replacing those empty spots where new kids would have previously
206640	209140	filled them, and immigrants also tend to have more children.
209140	212560	And separate from Lauren's video, separate from any sort of conspiracy theory, separate
212560	216700	from whether or not this is good or bad, intentional or not, the facts bear this out.
216700	220160	Here is the world's fertility rate by country, here is immigration by country.
220160	222700	You can go check this out yourself, the data is in on this.
222700	226600	And despite the data being in, we've seen a massive push from the legacy media to declare
226600	230760	that it's just not happening, and that you're actually a racist white nationalist if you
230760	231760	think it is.
231760	235000	The New York Times, for example, stated that Tucker Carlson uses rhetoric related to an
235000	239120	unfounded racist conspiracy theory that falling birth rates in immigration are leading to
239120	240800	the replacement of white people.
240800	245240	Versions of replacement theory have been promoted by extremists, and have helped inspire mass
245240	246240	shootings.
246240	249120	I don't know what Tucker says in these episodes, but the claim from the New York Times that
249120	252720	it's unfounded and racist to think that falling birth rates in immigration will lead to the
252720	255040	replacement of white people just seems to be false.
255040	256360	Check out this article by Tim Wise.
256360	259960	Those who push replacement theory are to blame for racist terrorism.
259960	263400	Looking at you Tucker Carlson, violence is the inevitable result of such thinking, and
263400	264900	its mouthpieces should be held accountable.
264900	268920	This entire article is shrieking about how the great replacement conspiracy theory is
268920	274140	not simply within the manifesto of 4chan radicalized shooters, but is in fact parroted by mainstream
274140	278200	figures on the right, spoken about openly by GOP elected officials.
278200	281480	And the author believes that the only possible thing to do with somebody who believes that
281480	284640	this is happening, you know, somebody who believes in the data, is to kill them before
284640	285640	they kill you.
285640	287360	Debate and discussion is irrelevant.
287360	289760	They have to die, or so Tim Wise says.
289760	294540	On NPR a week ago, the great replacement conspiracy theory isn't fringe anymore, it's mainstream.
294540	295540	Check this out.
295540	300200	A recent poll found that 1 in 3 American adults now believes in a version of replacement theory.
300200	303080	The speed with which this false narrative has tipped into American discourse since a
303080	307520	French ethno-nationalist, first coined the term roughly a decade ago, has stunned even
307520	311180	extremism experts who have tracked the spread of hate-filled ideologies.
311180	315620	In 2010 and 2020, the percentage of Americans who identified as white only declined by more
315620	321340	than 10%, from 72% to 62%.
321340	326080	So it's a false narrative that one third of Americans believe because of social media
326080	331280	and Fox News, and at the same time, the data that you yourself post in the very next paragraph
331280	332780	shows it to be true?
332780	336660	At this point, it seems like the left's position on the great replacement is, if you talk about
336660	340860	it, if you parrot its points to your audience, then you are responsible for the crazies who
340860	344300	come out and commit violence in its name, even though the data shows it to be true.
344300	347820	Okay, let's take a look at people who have come out and talked about it, and are therefore
347820	350240	responsible for Christchurch and Buffalo.
350240	352780	Here's a journalist for the Daily Beast, Wajahat Ali.
352780	354420	Do you believe in the great replacement?
354420	355420	Do you condemn it?
355420	358700	If you do condemn the replacement theory and the Buffalo White supremacist terrorist actions
358700	360720	of Manifesto, why are you repeating it?
360720	364280	Why do you create ads saying the exact same thing he wrote?
364280	367380	Journalists and reporters should be asking this of every Republican elected official
367380	368380	this week.
368380	369780	Here's Ali back in 2019.
369780	373940	The USA and the European Union won't be able to replenish their population without
373940	374940	immigrants.
374940	379820	Also, fewer working people will hurt the economy, and less workers means less taxes for social
379820	380820	services.
380820	382860	White nationalism is in for a hell of a surprise.
382860	386740	So Ali, why are you repeating the content of the Buffalo Shooters Manifesto?
386740	388660	Here's an article in Bloomberg.
388660	390100	Demography favors the Democrats.
390100	393940	We know that the racial identity of the average American is changing, and with this demographic
393940	396240	shift comes monumental political consequences.
396240	400280	We already witnessed the effects of this in the 2008 presidential election, for example,
400280	403420	when young and minority voters carried Barack Obama to victory.
403420	406480	That year, it seems, a switch flipped in favor of the Democratic Party.
406480	411000	And if voting preferences and turnout trends continue as they have been in the past several
411000	414800	elections, America's increasingly diverse electorate isn't going to make it easy to
414800	416120	flip the switch back.
416120	418380	Here's California House Rep. Ted Lieu.
418380	422380	Native-born Americans like you are no more American and no less American than an immigrant
422380	423380	like me.
423380	426820	Every passing year, there will be more people who look like me in the U.S.
426820	427820	You can't stop it.
427820	435300	So take your racist replacement theory and shove it.
435300	440020	He's literally calling people a racist for believing in the very thing he describes.
440020	441820	Reality is racist now, guys.
441820	445700	Despite the New York Times lambasting Tucker Carlson earlier in the video, here's an article
445700	449100	from them in 2018, titled We Can Replace Them.
449100	452960	Right now, America is tearing itself apart, as an embittered white conservative minority
452960	457200	clings to power, terrified at being swamped by a new multiracial polyglot majority.
457200	461000	The divide feels especially stark in Georgia, where the midterm election is a battle between
461000	465260	Trumpist reaction and the multicultural America whose emergence of the right is trying at
465260	466640	all costs to forestall.
466640	470600	In a week, American voters can do to white nationalists what they fear the most, show
470600	472340	them they're being replaced.
472340	475760	How many Democrats, Democrat politicians, voters, celebrities, whatever, do you think
475760	478200	have made public statements alluding to demographic change?
478200	481780	In a few years, we're going to be a majority brown country.
481780	483860	White people will not be the majority in the country anymore.
483860	489180	This will be the first generation ever in American history in which whites will be a
489180	491660	minority of the generation at some point.
491660	497180	As of 2007, every year, babies being born in this country, whites now are the minority.
497180	499920	In 2044, everyone is going to be a minority.
499920	504100	As the demographics change, as white people become the minority in the country, which
504100	505580	is coming.
505580	507160	Demographics is destiny.
507160	508660	Demographics is destiny.
508660	509940	Demographics is destiny, right?
509940	511100	The country is changing.
511100	515340	I've been saying it here, other people have been saying it here for years now, even before
515340	516500	Donald Trump.
516500	518900	The demographics is destiny.
518900	522900	The white population is declining for the first time in history in America, while the
522900	526740	number of multiracial Americans have more than doubled.
526740	529860	So we live in a country where the demographics are changing, it's becoming less white.
529860	530860	Correct.
530860	531860	Okay.
531860	535540	You'll be announcing that we're calling the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic
535540	537100	nominee for president.
537100	538160	It's changing.
538160	541920	It's going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of the demographics,
541920	543320	because of the population growth.
543320	548380	The growth in Texas has been almost entirely driven by non-white population growth, mostly
548380	551000	by Hispanic and Latino population growth.
551000	559520	The idea that whites will not be the majority, I mean, it's an exciting transformation of
559520	560520	the country.
560520	564840	It's an exciting evolution and progress of our country in many different ways.
564840	568360	The white population is declining.
568360	570760	It was always on the upswing.
570760	574680	So that speaks to the beautiful diversity of America.
574680	582000	It speaks to how that population will, the demographics will weigh in politically.
582000	586200	So considering just how many of these people used some variation of the American white
586200	591040	nationalist slogan, demographics are destiny, are all of them responsible for white supremacist
591040	592040	violence?
592040	593040	President Biden seems to think so.
593040	597440	I believe anybody who echoes the replacement name is to blame, not for this particular
597440	605760	crime, but it's for no purpose, no purpose, except profit and or political benefit.
605760	606760	And it's wrong.
606760	608200	I couldn't have said it better myself, dude.
608200	611920	Of course, a core component of all of this is the idea that not only are demographics
611920	615220	changing, but that a series of elites are actively orchestrating the change for some
615220	616220	shadowy purpose.
616220	620200	A sentiment shared by Bernie Sanders back in 2007 when restricting illegal immigration
620200	624080	was not considered a racist right wing thing, but a protecting the working class left wing
624080	625080	thing.
625080	630440	If poverty is increasing and if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions
630440	635780	of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages
635780	640020	than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.
640020	647680	And as we know, the principal industries which hire the bulk of illegal aliens, that is construction
647680	655840	and landscaping, those are all industries in which wages are declining.
655840	660160	I don't hear that discussed on the Senate floor by the proponents of this amnesty legislation.
660160	661160	That's right.
661160	662160	They have no good response.
662160	665160	I just read something today that a lot of people coming into this country are coming
665160	667280	in as lifeguards.
667280	669620	I guess we can't find that's right.
669620	672040	We can't find American workers to work as lifeguards.
672040	676200	And this is the center of the conversation from the French grander placement to the American
676200	677800	neo-Nazi white genocide.
677800	682280	The culpability of some cabal of elites is necessary to transform what is simply a demographic
682280	683800	trend into a legitimate genocide.
683800	687360	And just so we're clear, the definition of genocide is acts committed with intent to
687360	691720	destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.
691720	695920	As such, killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of
695920	699560	the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring
699560	703460	about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent
703460	707280	births within the group, forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
707280	711220	If we're using this definition, the phrase acts committed with intent is an important
711220	712220	component.
712220	716100	A genocide is not something that can be accidentally or incidentally done.
716100	720340	There actually has to be that cabal of shadowy elites pulling the strings, not just individuals
720340	723860	who don't want to have kids and immigrants who just want to move to a more prosperous
723860	724860	nation.
724860	726820	For the white supremacists, that group is the elders of Zion.
726820	730580	For the socialists, it's the bourgeois 1%, but either way, there needs to be an intentionality
730580	731580	there.
731580	732580	And frankly, I don't think there is.
732700	735620	Listen to several white nationalists talk about this stuff, and they're quite friendly
735620	736620	people.
736620	739660	They're very much, oh, we don't actually hate any other races, we just want to secure
739660	740660	a future for white children.
740660	743900	And even if we take them at face value on that one, their ideas still don't fully
743900	744900	add up.
744900	748940	The rightoids can absolutely prove that demographics are changing, that white people are being
748940	752620	replaced with non-white immigration, and any leftoid who disagrees with that is just factually
752620	753620	wrong.
753620	756440	The data is not on their side, and they're asking you to disbelieve your own eyes.
756440	760740	But the rightoids cannot prove that there is a group of replacist elites who are actually
760740	763020	puppet masters of the migrants and of nations themselves.
763020	765900	They cannot prove that there is an intentionality behind the demographic shift.
765900	769620	Instead, they're the manic chain smoke or the wall full of pitchers and strings.
769620	773900	And as much as I hate the left's blatant anti-white racism, the right's conspiratorial
773900	778340	connect-the-dots attitude towards what actually turns out to be disparate data points in order
778340	780540	to craft a grand narrative is just as bad.
780540	785540	There is no concentrated effort by anti-whites in positions of power to exterminate the white
785540	786540	race.
786540	790220	The world economic form, for all of its evil, does not actually control nations.
790220	792260	Neither does the International Monetary Fund.
792260	796140	It's not the Jews, it's not the bourgeois capitalist 1%, it's none of that shit.
796140	800280	It seems far more likely to me that what's going on is the result of several disconnected
800280	801820	but overlapping factors.
801820	805340	Birth control and the resulting decline in birth rate began in the 1960s.
805340	809540	While women gaining the right to own property, hold down their own jobs, pursue higher education,
809540	815060	and vote all happened as part of a slow, multi-generational process starting long before the sexual revolution.
815060	819140	And yet these separate things are factors that best predict a population's demographic
819140	820140	decline.
820140	824540	There's no way that anti-white or anti-working class elites coordinated all of that shit
824540	828480	across history, especially since it's also happening in East Asian countries as well.
828480	833200	And as third world populations begin to industrialize and modernize, we see the same thing happening
833200	834200	to them too.
834200	837180	It's not an anti-white thing, it's a byproduct of success.
837180	841900	You can make a solid argument that increased immigration is supported by a minority of
841900	845740	radical progressives who actually believe in some kind of anti-whiteness.
845740	849340	It's not hard to find wackos who have been groomed into legitimately hating themselves
849340	850340	for a political purpose.
850340	852140	Oh god what the fuck are we looking at right now.
852140	856740	But it's absolutely the case that immigration is supported for economic and not racial reasons
856740	858040	by the majority of people.
858040	861980	First world countries have no qualms with extracting the best and brightest of the third
861980	865700	world, hamstringing their own advancement in the process, in order to suit our needs.
865700	869660	The reason that the rulers of our countries do this, well one reason is because they don't
869660	872700	have to deal with any sort of potential ethnic strife if it comes.
872700	875740	They've got enough money and power to be isolated from that sort of thing if necessary.
875740	879300	But more importantly, I think they genuinely believe that the strength of our culture is
879300	883220	so overpowering that immigrants will come here and immediately assimilate, rather than
883220	885380	creating ethnic enclaves like they actually have.
885380	888980	It's an attitude that we're just so awesome everyone is naturally going to become like
888980	891780	us so we don't have to worry about it, when in reality the process of assimilation is
891780	892840	a lot more bumpy.
892840	897380	There seems to be a high enough rate of immigration at which a host country can no longer finish
897380	900960	the process of assimilating the new arrivals before the next wave arrives, leading to over
900960	902340	time a lack of assimilation.
902340	907340	In other words, it's not anti-white malice or hatred, it's stupidity and irresponsibility.
907340	910700	It's not an intentional replacement, but to claim that there is no replacement at all
910700	912060	is to stick your head in the sand.
912060	914660	Nonetheless, I obviously don't think that the Buffalo Shooter did anything but make
914660	916300	the world an incrementally worse place.
916300	919900	If you want lower immigration numbers or deportation of illegal immigrants as a matter of government
919900	923260	policy, that's something you can vote for, that's a platform you can run on yourself.
923260	927100	And frankly, don't cry to me about how the Democrats imported a bunch of brown people
927100	928640	and now you can't win elections anymore.
928640	932860	Those newly arrived legal Latino immigrants in America are conservative as fuck.
932860	935080	They are a natural voting base for the GOP.
935080	939220	They value the family structure, their church, their community, hard work, all those conservative
939220	942080	virtues that the Republicans should be catering to.
942080	945860	They are the electoral path forward, much to the Democrats' dismay that they thought
945860	948020	they were always going to get the non-white vote.
948020	951480	If the right wants to win elections in the future, the path is pretty clear.
951480	955600	Stop believing in the image of a darkened cigarette smoke-filled room of suit-wearing
955600	958440	billionaires who are applauding the downfall of the white race.
958440	961980	And recognize that the newly arrived immigrants are much more likely to side with you than
961980	966700	with the rainbow-haired wokeoids whose policies turn every American inner city into a crack
966700	988260	shack.
