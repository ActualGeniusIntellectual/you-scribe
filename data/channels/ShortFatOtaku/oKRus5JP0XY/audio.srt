1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,820
So, I was reading the Buffalo Shooter's Manifesto for last week's TUBcast, and I'm sure I don't

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,420
need to tell you this, but a lot of his motivation revolved around The Great Replacement.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,020
In case you don't know, though I think everyone knows this by now, The Great Replacement is

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,060
a conspiracy theory by the French writer Renaud Camus.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,060
Camus?

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,060
Camus?

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,100
I don't know French guys, even though I'm a Canadian, I don't know French.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,280
It states that the predominantly ethnic French population of France is actively being replaced

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,860
by a one-two punch of declining indigenous French birth rates and an increase of foreign

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,320
immigration to France, specifically of the non-European variety, more specifically of

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,600
the Muslim variety.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,800
He believes this is a coordinated effort by a cabal of elites within French society that

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,720
he calls The Replacists.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,720
Though he only wrote about this idea in the context of France in his 2011 book The Grand

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,000
Replacement, the idea has a lot of similarity with the theories of the American neo-Nazi

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,340
David Lane, who coined the phrase white genocide to refer to, yeah, the exact same thing, low

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,840
fertility rates and high amounts of non-white immigration to America, leading to a demographic

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,340
decline of white people.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,420
Being a neo-Nazi, Lane obviously blamed a cabal of Jews running everything in place

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,000
of the French Replacists, but there's a lot of overlap between the two ideas, such that

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,740
in the modern era, the phrases great replacement and white genocide have become synonymous

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,360
despite them having two different origins, and the Buffalo Shooter used both of their

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,400
rhetoric interchangeably in his manifesto.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,000
By the way, if you're watching this on YouTube, ever since the Buffalo Massacre, YouTube's

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,920
been adding these COVID-type cards to every video discussing the topic, you can probably

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
see one right here below.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,360
It's nice to see that shepherding viewers to politically approved sources is alive and

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,800
well, even though lockdowns are over.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Yes, YouTube, the great savior, save us all from wrongthink.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm just joking around, please don't demonetize me.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,400
In the wake of Buffalo, just like in the wake of Christchurch, the online left began to

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,920
blame a number of rightist creators for spreading the great replacement conspiracy theory, and

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,280
therefore, radicalizing people into violence.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,520
One of these people so blamed is Lauren Southern.

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,040
I got into it a little bit in the Paul Joseph Watson video, the TLDR on Lauren Southern

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,440
is that while she was much more libertarian and conspiracy-y in her youth, she left the

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,280
alt-right, left the internet, started a family, and came back a year or two later as a very

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,200
standard conservative mom type.

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,320
Left-leaning people have been very vocal in blaming Destiny for helping rehab Lauren's

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,280
image among centrists, since the two of them have palled around a lot on stream since her

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,720
return, and she does seem to genuinely be moving away from some of her more radical

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
older views.

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,960
So now the discourse is, Destiny, how could you associate with a person who inspired Christchurch

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
and Buffalo?

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,640
It's possible that Lauren's aware of the influence that she's had, because her own

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,120
video on the great replacement from 2017 has been sent to private on her channel.

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,200
I know this because Sean did a video replying to it back in the day, and he links hers in

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,600
the description, and clicking on it brings up the fact that it's private, so it's

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
easy to actually confirm.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,120
That being said, it's not hard to find a copy of Lauren's video, and since a big

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,800
meta conversation in the Twitch politics space right now is Lauren rehabbing her image, I

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,120
decided to watch it to see what the fuss was all about.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,720
The great replacement is a term coined by French writer, Renaud Camus.

54
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,320
Oh yeah, that's how you pronounce the name, thanks Lauren.

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
You know what?

56
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,680
I actually didn't see this video back in 2017, and based on the number of people screeching

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,480
online, I thought this was going to be a video of Lauren Southern sacrificing black babies

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,800
to Moloch or something.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
But you know what?

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,160
She's very inflammatory, using some of the b-roll in the way that she does, and I don't

61
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,860
agree with her conclusions, but the actual raw data in the video seems to be accurate.

62
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,680
The birth rates of native people in first world countries, not just white ones, but

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,080
clearly places like Japan and South Korea as well, are down.

64
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,640
Immigration is slowly replacing those empty spots where new kids would have previously

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,140
filled them, and immigrants also tend to have more children.

66
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,560
And separate from Lauren's video, separate from any sort of conspiracy theory, separate

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,700
from whether or not this is good or bad, intentional or not, the facts bear this out.

68
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,160
Here is the world's fertility rate by country, here is immigration by country.

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,700
You can go check this out yourself, the data is in on this.

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,600
And despite the data being in, we've seen a massive push from the legacy media to declare

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,760
that it's just not happening, and that you're actually a racist white nationalist if you

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
think it is.

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,000
The New York Times, for example, stated that Tucker Carlson uses rhetoric related to an

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,120
unfounded racist conspiracy theory that falling birth rates in immigration are leading to

75
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,800
the replacement of white people.

76
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,240
Versions of replacement theory have been promoted by extremists, and have helped inspire mass

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
shootings.

78
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,120
I don't know what Tucker says in these episodes, but the claim from the New York Times that

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
it's unfounded and racist to think that falling birth rates in immigration will lead to the

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
replacement of white people just seems to be false.

81
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,360
Check out this article by Tim Wise.

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,960
Those who push replacement theory are to blame for racist terrorism.

83
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,400
Looking at you Tucker Carlson, violence is the inevitable result of such thinking, and

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
its mouthpieces should be held accountable.

85
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,920
This entire article is shrieking about how the great replacement conspiracy theory is

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,140
not simply within the manifesto of 4chan radicalized shooters, but is in fact parroted by mainstream

87
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,200
figures on the right, spoken about openly by GOP elected officials.

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,480
And the author believes that the only possible thing to do with somebody who believes that

89
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,640
this is happening, you know, somebody who believes in the data, is to kill them before

90
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
they kill you.

91
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,360
Debate and discussion is irrelevant.

92
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,760
They have to die, or so Tim Wise says.

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,540
On NPR a week ago, the great replacement conspiracy theory isn't fringe anymore, it's mainstream.

94
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,540
Check this out.

95
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,200
A recent poll found that 1 in 3 American adults now believes in a version of replacement theory.

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,080
The speed with which this false narrative has tipped into American discourse since a

97
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,520
French ethno-nationalist, first coined the term roughly a decade ago, has stunned even

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,180
extremism experts who have tracked the spread of hate-filled ideologies.

99
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,620
In 2010 and 2020, the percentage of Americans who identified as white only declined by more

100
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,340
than 10%, from 72% to 62%.

101
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,080
So it's a false narrative that one third of Americans believe because of social media

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,280
and Fox News, and at the same time, the data that you yourself post in the very next paragraph

103
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,780
shows it to be true?

104
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,660
At this point, it seems like the left's position on the great replacement is, if you talk about

105
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,860
it, if you parrot its points to your audience, then you are responsible for the crazies who

106
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,300
come out and commit violence in its name, even though the data shows it to be true.

107
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,820
Okay, let's take a look at people who have come out and talked about it, and are therefore

108
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,240
responsible for Christchurch and Buffalo.

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,780
Here's a journalist for the Daily Beast, Wajahat Ali.

110
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,420
Do you believe in the great replacement?

111
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
Do you condemn it?

112
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,700
If you do condemn the replacement theory and the Buffalo White supremacist terrorist actions

113
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,720
of Manifesto, why are you repeating it?

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,280
Why do you create ads saying the exact same thing he wrote?

115
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,380
Journalists and reporters should be asking this of every Republican elected official

116
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
this week.

117
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,780
Here's Ali back in 2019.

118
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,940
The USA and the European Union won't be able to replenish their population without

119
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,940
immigrants.

120
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,820
Also, fewer working people will hurt the economy, and less workers means less taxes for social

121
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,820
services.

122
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,860
White nationalism is in for a hell of a surprise.

123
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,740
So Ali, why are you repeating the content of the Buffalo Shooters Manifesto?

124
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,660
Here's an article in Bloomberg.

125
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,100
Demography favors the Democrats.

126
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,940
We know that the racial identity of the average American is changing, and with this demographic

127
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,240
shift comes monumental political consequences.

128
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,280
We already witnessed the effects of this in the 2008 presidential election, for example,

129
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,420
when young and minority voters carried Barack Obama to victory.

130
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,480
That year, it seems, a switch flipped in favor of the Democratic Party.

131
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,000
And if voting preferences and turnout trends continue as they have been in the past several

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,800
elections, America's increasingly diverse electorate isn't going to make it easy to

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,120
flip the switch back.

134
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,380
Here's California House Rep. Ted Lieu.

135
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,380
Native-born Americans like you are no more American and no less American than an immigrant

136
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
like me.

137
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,820
Every passing year, there will be more people who look like me in the U.S.

138
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,820
You can't stop it.

139
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:15,300
So take your racist replacement theory and shove it.

140
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,020
He's literally calling people a racist for believing in the very thing he describes.

141
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,820
Reality is racist now, guys.

142
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,700
Despite the New York Times lambasting Tucker Carlson earlier in the video, here's an article

143
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,100
from them in 2018, titled We Can Replace Them.

144
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,960
Right now, America is tearing itself apart, as an embittered white conservative minority

145
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,200
clings to power, terrified at being swamped by a new multiracial polyglot majority.

146
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,000
The divide feels especially stark in Georgia, where the midterm election is a battle between

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,260
Trumpist reaction and the multicultural America whose emergence of the right is trying at

148
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,640
all costs to forestall.

149
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,600
In a week, American voters can do to white nationalists what they fear the most, show

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,340
them they're being replaced.

151
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,760
How many Democrats, Democrat politicians, voters, celebrities, whatever, do you think

152
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,200
have made public statements alluding to demographic change?

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,780
In a few years, we're going to be a majority brown country.

154
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,860
White people will not be the majority in the country anymore.

155
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,180
This will be the first generation ever in American history in which whites will be a

156
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,660
minority of the generation at some point.

157
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,180
As of 2007, every year, babies being born in this country, whites now are the minority.

158
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,920
In 2044, everyone is going to be a minority.

159
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,100
As the demographics change, as white people become the minority in the country, which

160
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,580
is coming.

161
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,160
Demographics is destiny.

162
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,660
Demographics is destiny.

163
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,940
Demographics is destiny, right?

164
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,100
The country is changing.

165
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,340
I've been saying it here, other people have been saying it here for years now, even before

166
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,500
Donald Trump.

167
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,900
The demographics is destiny.

168
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,900
The white population is declining for the first time in history in America, while the

169
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,740
number of multiracial Americans have more than doubled.

170
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,860
So we live in a country where the demographics are changing, it's becoming less white.

171
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Correct.

172
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Okay.

173
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,540
You'll be announcing that we're calling the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic

174
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,100
nominee for president.

175
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,160
It's changing.

176
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,920
It's going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of the demographics,

177
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,320
because of the population growth.

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,380
The growth in Texas has been almost entirely driven by non-white population growth, mostly

179
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,000
by Hispanic and Latino population growth.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,520
The idea that whites will not be the majority, I mean, it's an exciting transformation of

181
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
the country.

182
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,840
It's an exciting evolution and progress of our country in many different ways.

183
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,360
The white population is declining.

184
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,760
It was always on the upswing.

185
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,680
So that speaks to the beautiful diversity of America.

186
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:42,000
It speaks to how that population will, the demographics will weigh in politically.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,200
So considering just how many of these people used some variation of the American white

188
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,040
nationalist slogan, demographics are destiny, are all of them responsible for white supremacist

189
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
violence?

190
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
President Biden seems to think so.

191
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,440
I believe anybody who echoes the replacement name is to blame, not for this particular

192
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,760
crime, but it's for no purpose, no purpose, except profit and or political benefit.

193
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
And it's wrong.

194
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,200
I couldn't have said it better myself, dude.

195
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,920
Of course, a core component of all of this is the idea that not only are demographics

196
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,220
changing, but that a series of elites are actively orchestrating the change for some

197
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
shadowy purpose.

198
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,200
A sentiment shared by Bernie Sanders back in 2007 when restricting illegal immigration

199
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,080
was not considered a racist right wing thing, but a protecting the working class left wing

200
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
thing.

201
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,440
If poverty is increasing and if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions

202
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,780
of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages

203
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,020
than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.

204
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:47,680
And as we know, the principal industries which hire the bulk of illegal aliens, that is construction

205
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,840
and landscaping, those are all industries in which wages are declining.

206
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,160
I don't hear that discussed on the Senate floor by the proponents of this amnesty legislation.

207
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
That's right.

208
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
They have no good response.

209
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I just read something today that a lot of people coming into this country are coming

210
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,280
in as lifeguards.

211
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,620
I guess we can't find that's right.

212
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,040
We can't find American workers to work as lifeguards.

213
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,200
And this is the center of the conversation from the French grander placement to the American

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,800
neo-Nazi white genocide.

215
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,280
The culpability of some cabal of elites is necessary to transform what is simply a demographic

216
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,800
trend into a legitimate genocide.

217
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,360
And just so we're clear, the definition of genocide is acts committed with intent to

218
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,720
destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.

219
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,920
As such, killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of

220
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,560
the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,460
about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent

222
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,280
births within the group, forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

223
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,220
If we're using this definition, the phrase acts committed with intent is an important

224
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,220
component.

225
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,100
A genocide is not something that can be accidentally or incidentally done.

226
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,340
There actually has to be that cabal of shadowy elites pulling the strings, not just individuals

227
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,860
who don't want to have kids and immigrants who just want to move to a more prosperous

228
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
nation.

229
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,820
For the white supremacists, that group is the elders of Zion.

230
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,580
For the socialists, it's the bourgeois 1%, but either way, there needs to be an intentionality

231
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
there.

232
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,580
And frankly, I don't think there is.

233
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,620
Listen to several white nationalists talk about this stuff, and they're quite friendly

234
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,620
people.

235
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,660
They're very much, oh, we don't actually hate any other races, we just want to secure

236
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,660
a future for white children.

237
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,900
And even if we take them at face value on that one, their ideas still don't fully

238
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
add up.

239
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,940
The rightoids can absolutely prove that demographics are changing, that white people are being

240
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,620
replaced with non-white immigration, and any leftoid who disagrees with that is just factually

241
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
wrong.

242
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,440
The data is not on their side, and they're asking you to disbelieve your own eyes.

243
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,740
But the rightoids cannot prove that there is a group of replacist elites who are actually

244
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,020
puppet masters of the migrants and of nations themselves.

245
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,900
They cannot prove that there is an intentionality behind the demographic shift.

246
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,620
Instead, they're the manic chain smoke or the wall full of pitchers and strings.

247
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,900
And as much as I hate the left's blatant anti-white racism, the right's conspiratorial

248
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,340
connect-the-dots attitude towards what actually turns out to be disparate data points in order

249
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,540
to craft a grand narrative is just as bad.

250
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,540
There is no concentrated effort by anti-whites in positions of power to exterminate the white

251
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
race.

252
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,220
The world economic form, for all of its evil, does not actually control nations.

253
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,260
Neither does the International Monetary Fund.

254
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,140
It's not the Jews, it's not the bourgeois capitalist 1%, it's none of that shit.

255
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,280
It seems far more likely to me that what's going on is the result of several disconnected

256
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,820
but overlapping factors.

257
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,340
Birth control and the resulting decline in birth rate began in the 1960s.

258
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,540
While women gaining the right to own property, hold down their own jobs, pursue higher education,

259
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,060
and vote all happened as part of a slow, multi-generational process starting long before the sexual revolution.

260
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,140
And yet these separate things are factors that best predict a population's demographic

261
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
decline.

262
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,540
There's no way that anti-white or anti-working class elites coordinated all of that shit

263
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,480
across history, especially since it's also happening in East Asian countries as well.

264
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,200
And as third world populations begin to industrialize and modernize, we see the same thing happening

265
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
to them too.

266
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,180
It's not an anti-white thing, it's a byproduct of success.

267
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,900
You can make a solid argument that increased immigration is supported by a minority of

268
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,740
radical progressives who actually believe in some kind of anti-whiteness.

269
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,340
It's not hard to find wackos who have been groomed into legitimately hating themselves

270
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
for a political purpose.

271
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,140
Oh god what the fuck are we looking at right now.

272
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,740
But it's absolutely the case that immigration is supported for economic and not racial reasons

273
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,040
by the majority of people.

274
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,980
First world countries have no qualms with extracting the best and brightest of the third

275
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,700
world, hamstringing their own advancement in the process, in order to suit our needs.

276
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,660
The reason that the rulers of our countries do this, well one reason is because they don't

277
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,700
have to deal with any sort of potential ethnic strife if it comes.

278
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,740
They've got enough money and power to be isolated from that sort of thing if necessary.

279
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,300
But more importantly, I think they genuinely believe that the strength of our culture is

280
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,220
so overpowering that immigrants will come here and immediately assimilate, rather than

281
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,380
creating ethnic enclaves like they actually have.

282
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,980
It's an attitude that we're just so awesome everyone is naturally going to become like

283
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,780
us so we don't have to worry about it, when in reality the process of assimilation is

284
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,840
a lot more bumpy.

285
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,380
There seems to be a high enough rate of immigration at which a host country can no longer finish

286
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,960
the process of assimilating the new arrivals before the next wave arrives, leading to over

287
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,340
time a lack of assimilation.

288
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,340
In other words, it's not anti-white malice or hatred, it's stupidity and irresponsibility.

289
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,700
It's not an intentional replacement, but to claim that there is no replacement at all

290
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,060
is to stick your head in the sand.

291
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,660
Nonetheless, I obviously don't think that the Buffalo Shooter did anything but make

292
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,300
the world an incrementally worse place.

293
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,900
If you want lower immigration numbers or deportation of illegal immigrants as a matter of government

294
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,260
policy, that's something you can vote for, that's a platform you can run on yourself.

295
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,100
And frankly, don't cry to me about how the Democrats imported a bunch of brown people

296
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,640
and now you can't win elections anymore.

297
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,860
Those newly arrived legal Latino immigrants in America are conservative as fuck.

298
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,080
They are a natural voting base for the GOP.

299
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,220
They value the family structure, their church, their community, hard work, all those conservative

300
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,080
virtues that the Republicans should be catering to.

301
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,860
They are the electoral path forward, much to the Democrats' dismay that they thought

302
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,020
they were always going to get the non-white vote.

303
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,480
If the right wants to win elections in the future, the path is pretty clear.

304
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,600
Stop believing in the image of a darkened cigarette smoke-filled room of suit-wearing

305
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,440
billionaires who are applauding the downfall of the white race.

306
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,980
And recognize that the newly arrived immigrants are much more likely to side with you than

307
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,700
with the rainbow-haired wokeoids whose policies turn every American inner city into a crack

308
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:28,260
shack.
