00:00.000 --> 00:09.820
So, I was reading the Buffalo Shooter's Manifesto for last week's TUBcast, and I'm sure I don't

00:09.820 --> 00:13.420
need to tell you this, but a lot of his motivation revolved around The Great Replacement.

00:13.420 --> 00:17.020
In case you don't know, though I think everyone knows this by now, The Great Replacement is

00:17.020 --> 00:20.060
a conspiracy theory by the French writer Renaud Camus.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.060
Camus?

00:21.060 --> 00:22.060
Camus?

00:22.060 --> 00:24.100
I don't know French guys, even though I'm a Canadian, I don't know French.

00:24.100 --> 00:29.280
It states that the predominantly ethnic French population of France is actively being replaced

00:29.280 --> 00:33.860
by a one-two punch of declining indigenous French birth rates and an increase of foreign

00:33.860 --> 00:38.320
immigration to France, specifically of the non-European variety, more specifically of

00:38.320 --> 00:39.600
the Muslim variety.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.800
He believes this is a coordinated effort by a cabal of elites within French society that

00:43.800 --> 00:45.720
he calls The Replacists.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.720
Though he only wrote about this idea in the context of France in his 2011 book The Grand

00:50.720 --> 00:55.000
Replacement, the idea has a lot of similarity with the theories of the American neo-Nazi

00:55.000 --> 01:00.340
David Lane, who coined the phrase white genocide to refer to, yeah, the exact same thing, low

01:00.340 --> 01:03.840
fertility rates and high amounts of non-white immigration to America, leading to a demographic

01:03.840 --> 01:05.340
decline of white people.

01:05.340 --> 01:09.420
Being a neo-Nazi, Lane obviously blamed a cabal of Jews running everything in place

01:09.420 --> 01:13.000
of the French Replacists, but there's a lot of overlap between the two ideas, such that

01:13.000 --> 01:17.740
in the modern era, the phrases great replacement and white genocide have become synonymous

01:17.740 --> 01:21.360
despite them having two different origins, and the Buffalo Shooter used both of their

01:21.360 --> 01:23.400
rhetoric interchangeably in his manifesto.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.000
By the way, if you're watching this on YouTube, ever since the Buffalo Massacre, YouTube's

01:27.000 --> 01:30.920
been adding these COVID-type cards to every video discussing the topic, you can probably

01:30.920 --> 01:31.920
see one right here below.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.360
It's nice to see that shepherding viewers to politically approved sources is alive and

01:35.360 --> 01:36.800
well, even though lockdowns are over.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.800
Yes, YouTube, the great savior, save us all from wrongthink.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.840
I'm just joking around, please don't demonetize me.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.400
In the wake of Buffalo, just like in the wake of Christchurch, the online left began to

01:45.400 --> 01:49.920
blame a number of rightist creators for spreading the great replacement conspiracy theory, and

01:49.920 --> 01:52.280
therefore, radicalizing people into violence.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.520
One of these people so blamed is Lauren Southern.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.040
I got into it a little bit in the Paul Joseph Watson video, the TLDR on Lauren Southern

01:58.040 --> 02:02.440
is that while she was much more libertarian and conspiracy-y in her youth, she left the

02:02.440 --> 02:06.280
alt-right, left the internet, started a family, and came back a year or two later as a very

02:06.280 --> 02:08.200
standard conservative mom type.

02:08.200 --> 02:12.320
Left-leaning people have been very vocal in blaming Destiny for helping rehab Lauren's

02:12.320 --> 02:16.280
image among centrists, since the two of them have palled around a lot on stream since her

02:16.280 --> 02:19.720
return, and she does seem to genuinely be moving away from some of her more radical

02:19.720 --> 02:20.720
older views.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.960
So now the discourse is, Destiny, how could you associate with a person who inspired Christchurch

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
and Buffalo?

02:25.960 --> 02:28.640
It's possible that Lauren's aware of the influence that she's had, because her own

02:28.640 --> 02:32.120
video on the great replacement from 2017 has been sent to private on her channel.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.200
I know this because Sean did a video replying to it back in the day, and he links hers in

02:36.200 --> 02:38.600
the description, and clicking on it brings up the fact that it's private, so it's

02:38.600 --> 02:39.720
easy to actually confirm.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.120
That being said, it's not hard to find a copy of Lauren's video, and since a big

02:43.120 --> 02:47.800
meta conversation in the Twitch politics space right now is Lauren rehabbing her image, I

02:47.800 --> 02:50.120
decided to watch it to see what the fuss was all about.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.720
The great replacement is a term coined by French writer, Renaud Camus.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.320
Oh yeah, that's how you pronounce the name, thanks Lauren.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
You know what?

02:57.320 --> 03:01.680
I actually didn't see this video back in 2017, and based on the number of people screeching

03:01.680 --> 03:05.480
online, I thought this was going to be a video of Lauren Southern sacrificing black babies

03:05.480 --> 03:06.800
to Moloch or something.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
But you know what?

03:07.800 --> 03:11.160
She's very inflammatory, using some of the b-roll in the way that she does, and I don't

03:11.160 --> 03:15.860
agree with her conclusions, but the actual raw data in the video seems to be accurate.

03:15.860 --> 03:19.680
The birth rates of native people in first world countries, not just white ones, but

03:19.680 --> 03:23.080
clearly places like Japan and South Korea as well, are down.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.640
Immigration is slowly replacing those empty spots where new kids would have previously

03:26.640 --> 03:29.140
filled them, and immigrants also tend to have more children.

03:29.140 --> 03:32.560
And separate from Lauren's video, separate from any sort of conspiracy theory, separate

03:32.560 --> 03:36.700
from whether or not this is good or bad, intentional or not, the facts bear this out.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.160
Here is the world's fertility rate by country, here is immigration by country.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.700
You can go check this out yourself, the data is in on this.

03:42.700 --> 03:46.600
And despite the data being in, we've seen a massive push from the legacy media to declare

03:46.600 --> 03:50.760
that it's just not happening, and that you're actually a racist white nationalist if you

03:50.760 --> 03:51.760
think it is.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.000
The New York Times, for example, stated that Tucker Carlson uses rhetoric related to an

03:55.000 --> 03:59.120
unfounded racist conspiracy theory that falling birth rates in immigration are leading to

03:59.120 --> 04:00.800
the replacement of white people.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.240
Versions of replacement theory have been promoted by extremists, and have helped inspire mass

04:05.240 --> 04:06.240
shootings.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.120
I don't know what Tucker says in these episodes, but the claim from the New York Times that

04:09.120 --> 04:12.720
it's unfounded and racist to think that falling birth rates in immigration will lead to the

04:12.720 --> 04:15.040
replacement of white people just seems to be false.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.360
Check out this article by Tim Wise.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.960
Those who push replacement theory are to blame for racist terrorism.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.400
Looking at you Tucker Carlson, violence is the inevitable result of such thinking, and

04:23.400 --> 04:24.900
its mouthpieces should be held accountable.

04:24.900 --> 04:28.920
This entire article is shrieking about how the great replacement conspiracy theory is

04:28.920 --> 04:34.140
not simply within the manifesto of 4chan radicalized shooters, but is in fact parroted by mainstream

04:34.140 --> 04:38.200
figures on the right, spoken about openly by GOP elected officials.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.480
And the author believes that the only possible thing to do with somebody who believes that

04:41.480 --> 04:44.640
this is happening, you know, somebody who believes in the data, is to kill them before

04:44.640 --> 04:45.640
they kill you.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.360
Debate and discussion is irrelevant.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.760
They have to die, or so Tim Wise says.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.540
On NPR a week ago, the great replacement conspiracy theory isn't fringe anymore, it's mainstream.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.540
Check this out.

04:55.540 --> 05:00.200
A recent poll found that 1 in 3 American adults now believes in a version of replacement theory.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.080
The speed with which this false narrative has tipped into American discourse since a

05:03.080 --> 05:07.520
French ethno-nationalist, first coined the term roughly a decade ago, has stunned even

05:07.520 --> 05:11.180
extremism experts who have tracked the spread of hate-filled ideologies.

05:11.180 --> 05:15.620
In 2010 and 2020, the percentage of Americans who identified as white only declined by more

05:15.620 --> 05:21.340
than 10%, from 72% to 62%.

05:21.340 --> 05:26.080
So it's a false narrative that one third of Americans believe because of social media

05:26.080 --> 05:31.280
and Fox News, and at the same time, the data that you yourself post in the very next paragraph

05:31.280 --> 05:32.780
shows it to be true?

05:32.780 --> 05:36.660
At this point, it seems like the left's position on the great replacement is, if you talk about

05:36.660 --> 05:40.860
it, if you parrot its points to your audience, then you are responsible for the crazies who

05:40.860 --> 05:44.300
come out and commit violence in its name, even though the data shows it to be true.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.820
Okay, let's take a look at people who have come out and talked about it, and are therefore

05:47.820 --> 05:50.240
responsible for Christchurch and Buffalo.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.780
Here's a journalist for the Daily Beast, Wajahat Ali.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.420
Do you believe in the great replacement?

05:54.420 --> 05:55.420
Do you condemn it?

05:55.420 --> 05:58.700
If you do condemn the replacement theory and the Buffalo White supremacist terrorist actions

05:58.700 --> 06:00.720
of Manifesto, why are you repeating it?

06:00.720 --> 06:04.280
Why do you create ads saying the exact same thing he wrote?

06:04.280 --> 06:07.380
Journalists and reporters should be asking this of every Republican elected official

06:07.380 --> 06:08.380
this week.

06:08.380 --> 06:09.780
Here's Ali back in 2019.

06:09.780 --> 06:13.940
The USA and the European Union won't be able to replenish their population without

06:13.940 --> 06:14.940
immigrants.

06:14.940 --> 06:19.820
Also, fewer working people will hurt the economy, and less workers means less taxes for social

06:19.820 --> 06:20.820
services.

06:20.820 --> 06:22.860
White nationalism is in for a hell of a surprise.

06:22.860 --> 06:26.740
So Ali, why are you repeating the content of the Buffalo Shooters Manifesto?

06:26.740 --> 06:28.660
Here's an article in Bloomberg.

06:28.660 --> 06:30.100
Demography favors the Democrats.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.940
We know that the racial identity of the average American is changing, and with this demographic

06:33.940 --> 06:36.240
shift comes monumental political consequences.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.280
We already witnessed the effects of this in the 2008 presidential election, for example,

06:40.280 --> 06:43.420
when young and minority voters carried Barack Obama to victory.

06:43.420 --> 06:46.480
That year, it seems, a switch flipped in favor of the Democratic Party.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.000
And if voting preferences and turnout trends continue as they have been in the past several

06:51.000 --> 06:54.800
elections, America's increasingly diverse electorate isn't going to make it easy to

06:54.800 --> 06:56.120
flip the switch back.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.380
Here's California House Rep. Ted Lieu.

06:58.380 --> 07:02.380
Native-born Americans like you are no more American and no less American than an immigrant

07:02.380 --> 07:03.380
like me.

07:03.380 --> 07:06.820
Every passing year, there will be more people who look like me in the U.S.

07:06.820 --> 07:07.820
You can't stop it.

07:07.820 --> 07:15.300
So take your racist replacement theory and shove it.

07:15.300 --> 07:20.020
He's literally calling people a racist for believing in the very thing he describes.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.820
Reality is racist now, guys.

07:21.820 --> 07:25.700
Despite the New York Times lambasting Tucker Carlson earlier in the video, here's an article

07:25.700 --> 07:29.100
from them in 2018, titled We Can Replace Them.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.960
Right now, America is tearing itself apart, as an embittered white conservative minority

07:32.960 --> 07:37.200
clings to power, terrified at being swamped by a new multiracial polyglot majority.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.000
The divide feels especially stark in Georgia, where the midterm election is a battle between

07:41.000 --> 07:45.260
Trumpist reaction and the multicultural America whose emergence of the right is trying at

07:45.260 --> 07:46.640
all costs to forestall.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.600
In a week, American voters can do to white nationalists what they fear the most, show

07:50.600 --> 07:52.340
them they're being replaced.

07:52.340 --> 07:55.760
How many Democrats, Democrat politicians, voters, celebrities, whatever, do you think

07:55.760 --> 07:58.200
have made public statements alluding to demographic change?

07:58.200 --> 08:01.780
In a few years, we're going to be a majority brown country.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.860
White people will not be the majority in the country anymore.

08:03.860 --> 08:09.180
This will be the first generation ever in American history in which whites will be a

08:09.180 --> 08:11.660
minority of the generation at some point.

08:11.660 --> 08:17.180
As of 2007, every year, babies being born in this country, whites now are the minority.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.920
In 2044, everyone is going to be a minority.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.100
As the demographics change, as white people become the minority in the country, which

08:24.100 --> 08:25.580
is coming.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.160
Demographics is destiny.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.660
Demographics is destiny.

08:28.660 --> 08:29.940
Demographics is destiny, right?

08:29.940 --> 08:31.100
The country is changing.

08:31.100 --> 08:35.340
I've been saying it here, other people have been saying it here for years now, even before

08:35.340 --> 08:36.500
Donald Trump.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.900
The demographics is destiny.

08:38.900 --> 08:42.900
The white population is declining for the first time in history in America, while the

08:42.900 --> 08:46.740
number of multiracial Americans have more than doubled.

08:46.740 --> 08:49.860
So we live in a country where the demographics are changing, it's becoming less white.

08:49.860 --> 08:50.860
Correct.

08:50.860 --> 08:51.860
Okay.

08:51.860 --> 08:55.540
You'll be announcing that we're calling the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic

08:55.540 --> 08:57.100
nominee for president.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.160
It's changing.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.920
It's going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of the demographics,

09:01.920 --> 09:03.320
because of the population growth.

09:03.320 --> 09:08.380
The growth in Texas has been almost entirely driven by non-white population growth, mostly

09:08.380 --> 09:11.000
by Hispanic and Latino population growth.

09:11.000 --> 09:19.520
The idea that whites will not be the majority, I mean, it's an exciting transformation of

09:19.520 --> 09:20.520
the country.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.840
It's an exciting evolution and progress of our country in many different ways.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.360
The white population is declining.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.760
It was always on the upswing.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.680
So that speaks to the beautiful diversity of America.

09:34.680 --> 09:42.000
It speaks to how that population will, the demographics will weigh in politically.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.200
So considering just how many of these people used some variation of the American white

09:46.200 --> 09:51.040
nationalist slogan, demographics are destiny, are all of them responsible for white supremacist

09:51.040 --> 09:52.040
violence?

09:52.040 --> 09:53.040
President Biden seems to think so.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.440
I believe anybody who echoes the replacement name is to blame, not for this particular

09:57.440 --> 10:05.760
crime, but it's for no purpose, no purpose, except profit and or political benefit.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.760
And it's wrong.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.200
I couldn't have said it better myself, dude.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.920
Of course, a core component of all of this is the idea that not only are demographics

10:11.920 --> 10:15.220
changing, but that a series of elites are actively orchestrating the change for some

10:15.220 --> 10:16.220
shadowy purpose.

10:16.220 --> 10:20.200
A sentiment shared by Bernie Sanders back in 2007 when restricting illegal immigration

10:20.200 --> 10:24.080
was not considered a racist right wing thing, but a protecting the working class left wing

10:24.080 --> 10:25.080
thing.

10:25.080 --> 10:30.440
If poverty is increasing and if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions

10:30.440 --> 10:35.780
of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages

10:35.780 --> 10:40.020
than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.

10:40.020 --> 10:47.680
And as we know, the principal industries which hire the bulk of illegal aliens, that is construction

10:47.680 --> 10:55.840
and landscaping, those are all industries in which wages are declining.

10:55.840 --> 11:00.160
I don't hear that discussed on the Senate floor by the proponents of this amnesty legislation.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.160
That's right.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.160
They have no good response.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.160
I just read something today that a lot of people coming into this country are coming

11:05.160 --> 11:07.280
in as lifeguards.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.620
I guess we can't find that's right.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.040
We can't find American workers to work as lifeguards.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.200
And this is the center of the conversation from the French grander placement to the American

11:16.200 --> 11:17.800
neo-Nazi white genocide.

11:17.800 --> 11:22.280
The culpability of some cabal of elites is necessary to transform what is simply a demographic

11:22.280 --> 11:23.800
trend into a legitimate genocide.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.360
And just so we're clear, the definition of genocide is acts committed with intent to

11:27.360 --> 11:31.720
destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.920
As such, killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of

11:35.920 --> 11:39.560
the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring

11:39.560 --> 11:43.460
about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent

11:43.460 --> 11:47.280
births within the group, forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

11:47.280 --> 11:51.220
If we're using this definition, the phrase acts committed with intent is an important

11:51.220 --> 11:52.220
component.

11:52.220 --> 11:56.100
A genocide is not something that can be accidentally or incidentally done.

11:56.100 --> 12:00.340
There actually has to be that cabal of shadowy elites pulling the strings, not just individuals

12:00.340 --> 12:03.860
who don't want to have kids and immigrants who just want to move to a more prosperous

12:03.860 --> 12:04.860
nation.

12:04.860 --> 12:06.820
For the white supremacists, that group is the elders of Zion.

12:06.820 --> 12:10.580
For the socialists, it's the bourgeois 1%, but either way, there needs to be an intentionality

12:10.580 --> 12:11.580
there.

12:11.580 --> 12:12.580
And frankly, I don't think there is.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.620
Listen to several white nationalists talk about this stuff, and they're quite friendly

12:15.620 --> 12:16.620
people.

12:16.620 --> 12:19.660
They're very much, oh, we don't actually hate any other races, we just want to secure

12:19.660 --> 12:20.660
a future for white children.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.900
And even if we take them at face value on that one, their ideas still don't fully

12:23.900 --> 12:24.900
add up.

12:24.900 --> 12:28.940
The rightoids can absolutely prove that demographics are changing, that white people are being

12:28.940 --> 12:32.620
replaced with non-white immigration, and any leftoid who disagrees with that is just factually

12:32.620 --> 12:33.620
wrong.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.440
The data is not on their side, and they're asking you to disbelieve your own eyes.

12:36.440 --> 12:40.740
But the rightoids cannot prove that there is a group of replacist elites who are actually

12:40.740 --> 12:43.020
puppet masters of the migrants and of nations themselves.

12:43.020 --> 12:45.900
They cannot prove that there is an intentionality behind the demographic shift.

12:45.900 --> 12:49.620
Instead, they're the manic chain smoke or the wall full of pitchers and strings.

12:49.620 --> 12:53.900
And as much as I hate the left's blatant anti-white racism, the right's conspiratorial

12:53.900 --> 12:58.340
connect-the-dots attitude towards what actually turns out to be disparate data points in order

12:58.340 --> 13:00.540
to craft a grand narrative is just as bad.

13:00.540 --> 13:05.540
There is no concentrated effort by anti-whites in positions of power to exterminate the white

13:05.540 --> 13:06.540
race.

13:06.540 --> 13:10.220
The world economic form, for all of its evil, does not actually control nations.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.260
Neither does the International Monetary Fund.

13:12.260 --> 13:16.140
It's not the Jews, it's not the bourgeois capitalist 1%, it's none of that shit.

13:16.140 --> 13:20.280
It seems far more likely to me that what's going on is the result of several disconnected

13:20.280 --> 13:21.820
but overlapping factors.

13:21.820 --> 13:25.340
Birth control and the resulting decline in birth rate began in the 1960s.

13:25.340 --> 13:29.540
While women gaining the right to own property, hold down their own jobs, pursue higher education,

13:29.540 --> 13:35.060
and vote all happened as part of a slow, multi-generational process starting long before the sexual revolution.

13:35.060 --> 13:39.140
And yet these separate things are factors that best predict a population's demographic

13:39.140 --> 13:40.140
decline.

13:40.140 --> 13:44.540
There's no way that anti-white or anti-working class elites coordinated all of that shit

13:44.540 --> 13:48.480
across history, especially since it's also happening in East Asian countries as well.

13:48.480 --> 13:53.200
And as third world populations begin to industrialize and modernize, we see the same thing happening

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
to them too.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.180
It's not an anti-white thing, it's a byproduct of success.

13:57.180 --> 14:01.900
You can make a solid argument that increased immigration is supported by a minority of

14:01.900 --> 14:05.740
radical progressives who actually believe in some kind of anti-whiteness.

14:05.740 --> 14:09.340
It's not hard to find wackos who have been groomed into legitimately hating themselves

14:09.340 --> 14:10.340
for a political purpose.

14:10.340 --> 14:12.140
Oh god what the fuck are we looking at right now.

14:12.140 --> 14:16.740
But it's absolutely the case that immigration is supported for economic and not racial reasons

14:16.740 --> 14:18.040
by the majority of people.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.980
First world countries have no qualms with extracting the best and brightest of the third

14:21.980 --> 14:25.700
world, hamstringing their own advancement in the process, in order to suit our needs.

14:25.700 --> 14:29.660
The reason that the rulers of our countries do this, well one reason is because they don't

14:29.660 --> 14:32.700
have to deal with any sort of potential ethnic strife if it comes.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.740
They've got enough money and power to be isolated from that sort of thing if necessary.

14:35.740 --> 14:39.300
But more importantly, I think they genuinely believe that the strength of our culture is

14:39.300 --> 14:43.220
so overpowering that immigrants will come here and immediately assimilate, rather than

14:43.220 --> 14:45.380
creating ethnic enclaves like they actually have.

14:45.380 --> 14:48.980
It's an attitude that we're just so awesome everyone is naturally going to become like

14:48.980 --> 14:51.780
us so we don't have to worry about it, when in reality the process of assimilation is

14:51.780 --> 14:52.840
a lot more bumpy.

14:52.840 --> 14:57.380
There seems to be a high enough rate of immigration at which a host country can no longer finish

14:57.380 --> 15:00.960
the process of assimilating the new arrivals before the next wave arrives, leading to over

15:00.960 --> 15:02.340
time a lack of assimilation.

15:02.340 --> 15:07.340
In other words, it's not anti-white malice or hatred, it's stupidity and irresponsibility.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.700
It's not an intentional replacement, but to claim that there is no replacement at all

15:10.700 --> 15:12.060
is to stick your head in the sand.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.660
Nonetheless, I obviously don't think that the Buffalo Shooter did anything but make

15:14.660 --> 15:16.300
the world an incrementally worse place.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.900
If you want lower immigration numbers or deportation of illegal immigrants as a matter of government

15:19.900 --> 15:23.260
policy, that's something you can vote for, that's a platform you can run on yourself.

15:23.260 --> 15:27.100
And frankly, don't cry to me about how the Democrats imported a bunch of brown people

15:27.100 --> 15:28.640
and now you can't win elections anymore.

15:28.640 --> 15:32.860
Those newly arrived legal Latino immigrants in America are conservative as fuck.

15:32.860 --> 15:35.080
They are a natural voting base for the GOP.

15:35.080 --> 15:39.220
They value the family structure, their church, their community, hard work, all those conservative

15:39.220 --> 15:42.080
virtues that the Republicans should be catering to.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.860
They are the electoral path forward, much to the Democrats' dismay that they thought

15:45.860 --> 15:48.020
they were always going to get the non-white vote.

15:48.020 --> 15:51.480
If the right wants to win elections in the future, the path is pretty clear.

15:51.480 --> 15:55.600
Stop believing in the image of a darkened cigarette smoke-filled room of suit-wearing

15:55.600 --> 15:58.440
billionaires who are applauding the downfall of the white race.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.980
And recognize that the newly arrived immigrants are much more likely to side with you than

16:01.980 --> 16:06.700
with the rainbow-haired wokeoids whose policies turn every American inner city into a crack

16:06.700 --> 16:28.260
shack.
